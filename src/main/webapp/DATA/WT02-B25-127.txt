<p><i>Use this document to prepare yourself and your AMI members
for potential questions about the science and treatment of brain
disorders.</i></p>

<p><b><u>General</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>What are brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain disorders are severe mental illnesses such as
        schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive
        disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
        illness), and major depression. They are biologically based
        physical disorders that can be chronic and disabling, often
        lasting throughout a person&#146;s adult life. Thanks to
        scientific advances, brain disorders can usually be
        diagnosed and effectively treated.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Can brain disorders be prevented?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain disorders cannot be prevented, but experience shows
        that effective treatment lessens the severity of brain
        disorders and prevents them from becoming even more
        debilitating.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Prevalence</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>How many people suffer from brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain disorders affect a much smaller percentage of the
        population than many other physical illnesses. In any
        given year, 2.8 percent of adults in the U.S., or five
        million Americans, suffer from a severe form of a brain disorder,
        while 18 percent (or 32 million) are affected by heart disease.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>At what age do brain disorders strike?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain disorders commonly strike during late adolescence
        and early adulthood, although they can also begin in
        childhood or in late adulthood. They can be chronic and
        affect some people throughout their adult lives.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Causes</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>What are the causes of brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain chemistry, structure, and functioning, as well as
        genes, have been identified as key and necessary
        components for developing brain disorders.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Scientists have identified the brain chemicals serotonin,
        dopamine, and norepinephrine and their receptors, which
        control much of our mental and physical activities.
        Research has found imbalances in these chemicals in people
        with disorders such as schizophrenia and depression.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The brains of people with brain disorders are
        structurally different than the brains of healthy individuals.
        Through advanced imaging technology, scientists have been
        able to take &quot;pictures&quot; that show structural differences in
        the brains of individuals with brain disorders.
        Scientists have also detected different functioning in
        regions of the cortex and other areas of the brain in individuals
        with brain disorders.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Recent studies suggest genetic links for some brain
        disorders. Scientists are currently working to pinpoint
        the specific genes responsible for these disorders.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Aren&#146;t mental illnesses a sign of weakness and
instability? </i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Despite age-old myths and misinformation, severe
        &quot;mental illnesses&quot; are not caused by bad character,
        poor child-rearing, or an individual&#146;s behavior. A
        severe mental illness is a brain disorder which, like the brain disorders
        Parkinson&#146;s disease, Alzheimer&#146;s disease, and
        epilepsy, are biologically based physical disorders. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>It is important for all Americans to understand that
        brain disorders have physiological indicators, and that
        they can usually be diagnosed and treated as effectively
        as many other medical conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Are brain disorders inherited?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Recent studies suggest genetic links for some brain
        disorders. For example, an average child has a one
        percent chance of experiencing schizophrenia in his or
        her lifetime. However, the child of one parent with schizophrenia
        faces a 10 percent chance, while the child of two parents with schizophrenia
        faces a 50 percent chance. Scientists are currently working
        to pinpoint the specific genes responsible for these disorders.<sup>12</sup></li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Treatment</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>Are brain disorders treatable?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Yes. Like other medical problems, there are many
        treatments that are available to help people with brain
        disorders live healthy, productive lives.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>According to the National Institute of Mental Health,
        medications and other therapies improve the symptoms of
        severe forms of brain disorders for: 60 percent of people
        with schizophrenia; 70 percent to 90 percent of people with
        panic disorder; 75 percent of people with OCD; 80 percent to
        90 percent of people with bipolar disorder
        (manic-depressive illness); and 70 percent to 80 percent
        of people with major depression.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>These success rates are far better than those of other
        medical conditions. For example, heart disease has just a
        45 to 50 percent treatment success rate.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In addition, the new generation of medications under
        development can better target the cause of a particular
        brain disorder. This increased precision reduces the
        unintended side effects associated with many older treatments.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Are there any new advances in treatment of brain
disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>There are a number of exciting new advances in
        medications. New medications are designed to act with
        greater precision, isolating one particular group of
        brain chemicals. This precision would vastly reduce unintended
        side effects, including muscular tremors, caused by some older treatments.<sup>19</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The anticonvulsant valproate (Depakote) was approved by
        the FDA for bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness)
        in 1995. It has been found effective for different kinds
        of bipolar disorder and is often combined with lithium
        for maximum effect.<sup>32</sup> Many other medications
        are currently being tested for their effectiveness in
        treating bipolar disorder. Some of the most promising
        medications are calcium channel blockers, which appear to successfully
        treat individuals unresponsive to existing medication
        therapy.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Sertindole (Serlect) and olanzapine (Zyprexa) may win FDA
        approval by year end for treatment of schizophrenia.
        These medications would be the first major new class of
        schizophrenia medications in over 40 years.<sup>19</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>NGD 91-1 is in the early stage of clinical trials for
        panic disorder. The medication is designed to treat
        symptoms of panic disorder without sedating people.<sup>19</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Antidepressants sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine
        (Paxil) are now being reviewed by the FDA for treatment
        of OCD.<sup>30</sup> Antidepressant medications still to
        be studied for treating OCD are venlafaxine (Effexor) and nefazodone
        (Serzone).<sup>27</sup> These medications may have fewer
        side effects, such as tremor and sedation, which are
        associated with older antidepressants.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Are brain disorders linked to the increasing rate of
suicide?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>If left untreated, brain disorders such as depression and
        schizophrenia can become extremely debilitating and can
        even lead to suicide. For example, 15 percent of people
        with major depression and 10 to 15 percent of people with
        schizophrenia commit suicide.<sup>15</sup> This is one reason
        why it is so important that people suffering from brain
        disorders get the treatment they need.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Costs</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>Does insurance cover treatment of brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Studies indicate that, if you have health insurance, 90
        percent of insurance companies offer lesser benefits for
        brain disorders than for other physical conditions.
        Typically, hospitalization is unlimited for other
        physical disorders, while it is limited to 30 to 60 days
        for a brain disorder. In terms of outpatient treatment,
        visits are unlimited for other physical conditions, while
        visits for brain disorders are often limited to 20 times
        per year.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
    <li>Research shows that co-payments are also inequitable --
        usually up to 20 percent for other physical illnesses vs.
        40 or 50 percent for brain disorders.<sup>4</sup> Many
        other physical illnesses usually have lifetime maximum benefits
        of $1 million; the maximum lifetime benefits for brain disorders are
        usually $20,000, which barely cover the cost of a single hospitalization. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>This discrimination and increased financial burden often
        prevent people with brain disorders from getting the
        treatment they need, even though this treatment is often
        more effective than treatment for other medical illnesses. Discrimination
        also results in dumping people into the public sector,
        paid for by taxpayers.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>What do brain disorder medications cost?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The cost of medications to treat brain disorders is
        comparable to the cost of medications needed to treat
        other physical illnesses.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Isn&#146;t it expensive for insurance to cover the cost
of treating brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The cost of covering treatment for people with brain
        disorders is comparable to the cost of covering treatment
        for people with many other physical disorders. Studies
        indicate that, if all adults had access to health insurance
        coverage for brain disorders equal to other physical disorders (parity),
        the employer-paid premiums would only increase by 1.5
        percent each month, or approximately $2 per month per
        employee.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
    <li>In states with health insurance parity for brain
        disorders, the added costs to employers have been minimal.
        In Texas, the additional cost for treating state
        employees and their families for brain disorders was
        $2.47 per person per month (1994/5). In Rhode Island, the
        increased premium cost for covered individuals was only
        30 cents per person each month.<sup>9</sup> These real-life experiences
        in several states demonstrate that providing equal coverage
        makes good economic sense. <br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>What are the costs of treating brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The cost of treating a brain disorder is comparable to
        the cost of treating many other medical illnesses.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>For example, the average total direct cost in 1990 for
        treating a person with severe diabetes was $7,725,
        compared with $7,158 for treating a person with
        schizophrenia.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In Texas in 1994, the total cost of treating state
        employees and their family members with brain disorders
        was one-fifth the cost of treating cardiovascular
        disease.<sup>9</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In 1994, one managed care company in Texas -- a state
        where parity legislation exists for state employees --
        had 12,233 claimants for cardiovascular disease and 4,617
        claimants for schizophrenia. The average cost for
        treating people with cardiovascular disease was $2,496, compared
        to $1,424 for people with schizophrenia.<sup>9<br>
        </sup></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>What are the costs of NOT treating brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>There are many indirect costs to society resulting from
        brain disorders, including lost productivity, increased
        use of general medical services, crime/incarceration, and
        use of social welfare benefits. <br>
        </li>
    <li>In 1990, the indirect cost to society of brain disorders
        in the U.S. was conservatively estimated at $75 billion.
        This cost includes lost productivity and earnings due to
        illness, as well as lost earnings due to premature death.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>One study indicated that the cost (direct and indirect)
        of treating brain disorders such as schizophrenia, panic
        disorder, OCD, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
        illness), and major depression was $148 billion in 1990,
        vs. $160 billion for heart disease.<sup>4</sup> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>However, if only 80 percent of people with brain
        disorders received treatment, the overall costs to
        society would be reduced by $2.2 billion.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Won&#146;t costs skyrocket as more and more people seek
treatment? </i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Actually, costs could be reduced significantly if more
        people with brain disorders sought treatment. If only 80
        percent of the people with brain disorders were treated,
        the overall costs to society would be reduced by $2.2.
        billion per year.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
    <li>Specifically, two-thirds of premature deaths
        (approximately 128,000) would be averted, restoring $5.2
        billion in lost lifetime earnings to the economy.<sup>4</sup> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>There would be a 10 percent reduction in use of general
        medical care by people with brain disorders. This would
        reduce costs by $1.2 billion per year.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Costs associated with morbidity, the criminal justice
        system, social welfare, and incarceration would also be
        reduced if only 80 percent of individuals with brain
        disorders received treatment.<sup>4</sup><font size="3"> </font></li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Comparisons to Other Illnesses</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>How effective are brain disorder treatments compared to
treatments for other illnesses?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Treatment of brain disorders is more effective than
        treatment for many other medical conditions. According to
        the National Institute of Mental Health, medications and
        other therapies improve the symptoms of severe forms of
        brain disorders for: 60 percent of people with
        schizophrenia; 70 percent to 90 percent of people with
        panic disorder; 75 percent of people with OCD; 80 percent
        to 90 percent of people with bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
        illness); and 70 percent to 80 percent of people with major
        depression.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>By comparison, heart disease has just a 45 to 50 percent
        treatment success rate.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Policy</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>Why is it important for policymakers to learn about
brain disorder issues?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Policymakers need to understand the latest information
        about the science and treatment of brain disorders
        because millions of Americans with disorders currently
        face serious discrimination and lack of health insurance
        coverage, which exact a significant human and financial
        toll. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Individuals with brain disorders often cannot obtain
        adequate health insurance coverage. Many insurance
        companies exercise the &quot;pre-existing condition&quot;
        clause, barring people who may have had as few as two counseling
        sessions from obtaining coverage. <br>
        </li>
    <li>Research indicates that, if you have health insurance, 90
        percent of insurance companies offer lesser benefits for
        brain disorders than for other physical conditions.
        Typically, hospitalization is unlimited for other physical
        disorders, while it is limited to 30 to 60 days for a
        brain disorder. In terms of outpatient treatment, visits
        are unlimited for other physical conditions, while visits for
        brain disorders are often limited to 20 times per year.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
    <li>Studies show that co-payments are also inequitable --
        usually up to 20 percent for other physical illnesses vs.
        40 or 50 percent for brain disorders.<sup>4</sup> Other
        physical illnesses usually have lifetime maximum benefits
        of $1 million; the maximum lifetime benefits for brain
        disorders are usually $20,000, which barely cover the
        cost of a single hospitalization. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>This discrimination and increased financial burden often
        prevent people with brain disorders from getting the
        treatment they need, even though this treatment is often
        more effective than treatment for other medical illnesses. Discrimination
        also results in dumping people into the public sector,
        paid for by taxpayers.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>What can policymakers do to improve treatment of people
with brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Policymakers can pass legislation supporting health
        insurance parity -- equal coverage for brain and other
        physical disorders. They can help ensure that brain
        disorders and other medical illnesses are treated equally in
        any state or federal health care legislation. They can
        support increases (or resist decreases) in mental health
        budgets and encourage and fund additional research.</li>
