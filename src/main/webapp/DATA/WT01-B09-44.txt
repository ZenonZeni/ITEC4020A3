<p>	Electricore, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle Consortium, is successfully building the foundation for true development of the necessary technologies, industrial base and support infrastructure for a viable commercial electric/hybrid-electric vehicle industry.</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-4b.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-4a.gif"></a><center><b>Electricore's participants span the United States, from California to Massachusetts.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>



<p>	This industry is integral to the development of cost-effective military electric and hybrid-electric vehicle applications.  As military demand, alone, will not be large enough to support a defense-unique industrial base, the Electricore consortia partnerships have successfully developed advanced technology systems from the lab to the marketplace, yielding the technology "guts" required for both military and civilian applications.</p>
<p>	Successful project developments include advanced batteries specifically designed for electric vehicles, special battery monitoring packs and safety improvements which have had ground-breaking impact.  Technology developments are having actual impact on the market. In January, 1996 General Motors introduced the EV-1 -- the first production electric vehicle introduced by one of the "Big Three." Two Electricore participants supported the development of the technologies used in this vehicle via design of the electric drive motor system, a drive motor and gear set designed to produce the vehicle with the smoothest possible acceleration. </p>
<p>	Development of the battery pack system occurred concurrently alongside the development of the drive unit and includes a purpose built, deep-cycle, maintenance-free, valve-regulated, lead-acid recombinate battery. This battery is the first of its kind in the market and is the same system used in the DARPA military bus projects.</p>
<p>	The successful marriage of key developmental technologies with civilian markets has underscored the importance of dual use technologies. Current projects which will impact both the military and civilian markets include:</p>

<ul>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Electric Variable Transmission</FONT></h3></p>
<p>	Led by Allison Transmission, the system offers efficiency benefits over the conventional powertrain for high average power vehicle applications. This scalable technology is appropriate for military applications for a HMMWV, a five ton truck or a 25 ton tracked vehicle or civilian applications for a 30' or 40' city bus.
</p>
<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>High Efficiency Air Conditioning</FONT></h3></p>
<p>	Led by Nartron, this advanced high efficiency, microprocessor controlled, turbine driven, modular air conditioner will meet both electric bus requirements, all types of military vehicles including surface, air and watercraft such as locomotives and rail cars, heavy duty trucks, off road equipment, shipboard tower mounted electronics, fixed wing and non fixed wing aircraft.</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Synchronous Reluctance Motor</FONT></h3></p>
<p>	Led by Delphi Energy and Engine Management Systems, the SRN represents a new motor design which combines novel manufacturing processes, new composite materials and new control strategies to mass produce advanced motors with optimized efficiencies at lower cost and weight than similar induction motors. These motors will be suitable for electric and hybrid electric military and civilian vehicles including all but the largest tracked military vehicle applications</p>
<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Non-Invasive Battery Measurement Technology</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	Led by Premium Power of Slidell, Louisiana, this project is developing a new non-invasive technique to measure battery state-of-charge called "Time Domain Spectroscopy."  This technology has many potential applications in all areas of electrochemistry including military electrochemical storage units, quality control in battery manufacturing, accurate on-board electric vehicle "fuel" gauge, as well as medical applications.
</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Advanced Mos-Gated Thyristers</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	Led by Rutgers University, this project is designing and fabricating a novel MOS-gated Thyristor, using a SiC wide bandgap semiconductor for high power and high temperature applications in electric vehicles.</p>
<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Electric/Hybrid Vehicle Virtual Proving Ground</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	Led by the University of lowa, the virtual proving ground focuses on the Army's high mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) with an experimental electric/hybrid drive train. The virtual proving ground is designed to support hybrid-electric vehicle systems, including development of drive train, energy storage, and motors, carrying out simulation based trade off analysis and design optimization.</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Lower Management and Storage Systems for Hybrid Electric Drives</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	Led by SATCON, the program develops and tests hybrid electric drive system control and energy storage for a wide variety of military and commercial vehicles using flywheel energy storage units.</p>
