<h1>1. INTRODUCTION</h1>

<hr>

<p>Law may be rooted in fiction as well as fact. Indeed, a public
policy conceived in ignorance may be continuously reaffirmed,
ever more vehemently, so long as its origins remain obscure or
its fallacy unexposed. Yet once a spark of truth ignites the
public opinion process, the authority of time will not stay the
flames of controversy. In stable times the policy may soon be
reversed or modified to comport with reality. In volatile times,
however, a single controversy may lose its urgency. Fueled by
flames generated by related public issues, the fire may spread;
truth may again be consumed in the explosive collision of
competing cultural ideologies. </p>

<p>So it has been with marijuana.' Suppressed for forty years
without significant public attention, the &quot;killer weed&quot;
has suddenly surfaced as the preferred euphoriant of millions of
Americans. Hardly a day passes without public exposure to
propaganda from one side or the other. Hardly a day passes
without arrests of newsworthy figures for violations of marijuana
laws. Before legislatures and courts, the law is attacked and
defended with equal fervor. Sociological, medical and police
testimony regarding the drug's effects is delivered feverishly to
an attentive public. </p>

<p>Yet, apart from some expedient peripheral actions, little has
been done. Detailed studies have been commissioned, but there has
been no significant reconsideration of basic assumptions. Because
the marijuana issue has become ensnared in broader social
polemics, it has been stalemated. Stability and change, defiance
and repression, hippieism and middle-Americanism, &quot;law and
order&quot; and protest politics define the cultural milieu of
which the marijuana issue is viewed as but a symptom. </p>

<p>This Article is motivated by twin concerns: that the flagrant
disregard of marijuana laws bespeaks a growing disenchantment
with the capacity of our legal system rationally to order
society, and that the assimilation of the marijuana issue into
larger social conflicts has consigned the debate to the public
viscera instead of the public mind. Through a historical analysis
of the marijuana laws we hope to refocus the debate. An
understanding of the origins of the laws might modulate the
challengers' hostile accusations and at the same time promote in
legislators an awareness of their own responsibility. </p>

<p>For the purposes both of description and evaluation, law is
inseparable from the process by which it is adopted and the
values it manifests. Accordingly, our history focuses both on the
public policy formation process and on evolving patterns of our
culture. With respect to policy, formation, marijuana's legal
history is a significant illustration of the interaction of the
public opinion, legislative and judicial processes, and, in a
broader sense, the relation between folkways and gateways. With
respect to its value-content, the evolution of marijuana policy
reflects quite precisely emerging cultural attitudes toward
pluralism, privacy and individual pursuit of pleasure in an
increasingly mechanized and depersonalized technological society.
</p>

<hr>

<p>1Throughout its tumultuous history, the common name of the
cannabis drug has been spelled in numerous ways-marihuana,
meriguana, marijuana, marijuana. We will use the last spelling
because it appears most often in modern publications and conforms
more nearly to the Spanish. <br>
