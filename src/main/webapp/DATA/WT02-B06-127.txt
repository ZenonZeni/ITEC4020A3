<h2>The Statutory Language At Issue</h2>

<font size = +1>

<p>81.  Signed into law on February 8, 1996, the
Communications Decency Act criminalizes the display and
distribution of constitutionally protected expressive material.

<p>82.  The Act contains two primary criminal provisions. 
Violation of either provision is a felony, punishable by as much
as two years in prison and substantial fines.  

<p>83.  Section 502(2) of the Act, to be codified at 47
U.S.C. &#167; 223(d), broadly prohibits knowingly using any
"interactive computer service" to send to a specific person or
persons under 18 years of age, or to "display," "in a manner
available to" a person under 18, certain "patently offensive"
communications.  Section 502(2) provides, in pertinent part:

<blockquote>(d) Whoever--

   <blockquote>(1) in interstate or foreign communications
   knowingly--

         <blockquote>(A) uses an interactive computer service to
      send to a specific person or persons under 18
      years of age, or

       <p>(B) uses any interactive computer service to
      display in a manner available to a person under
      18 years of age, </blockquote>

   any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image,
   or other communication that, in context, depicts or
   describes, in terms patently offensive as measured
   by contemporary community standards, sexual or
   excretory activities or organs, regardless of
   whether the user of such service placed the call or
   initiated the communication; or

   <p>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications
   facility under such person's control to be used for
   an activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the
   intent that it be used for such activity,</blockquote>

shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or
imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</blockquote>

Act &#167; 502(2).

<p>84.  "Interactive computer service" is defined as "any
information service, system, or access software provider that
provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a
computer server, including specifically a service or system that
provides access to the Internet and such systems operated or
services offered by libraries or educational institutions."  
<br>Act &#167; 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(h)(2)) referring to
Act &#167; 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230(e)(2)).
          
<p>85.  The terms "patently offensive," "contemporary
community standards," and "display" are nowhere defined in the
Act.

<p>86.  Another section of the Act, Section 502(1), to be
codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a)(1)(B), prohibits and criminalizes
the use of a "telecommunications device" knowingly to make or
create and "initiate[] the transmission of, any comment, request,
suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is
. . . indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communication
is under 18 years of age."  Another provision of the same section
makes it a crime to "knowingly permit[] any telecommunications
facility under [a person's] control to be used for any activity
prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for
such activity." 
<br>Act &#167; 502(1) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.
&#167; 223(a)(2)).

<p>87.  "Telecommunications device" is defined to exclude
an "interactive computer service." 
<br>Act &#167; 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(h)(1)(B)).

<p>88.  The term "indecent" is not defined.

<p>89.  The Act establishes several defenses a defendant
may assert in a criminal prosecution under the Act.  First, no
person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d)
solely for providing access or connection to or from a
facility, system, or network not under that person's
control, including transmission, downloading,
intermediate storage, access software, or other related
capabilities that are incidental to providing such
access or connection that does not include the creation
of the content of the communication.
<br>Act &#167; 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(1)).

<p>90.  The phrase "not under that person's control" is
nowhere defined in the Act.

<p>91.  This defense is not available "to a person who is
a conspirator with an entity actively involved in the creation or
knowing distribution of communications that violate this section,
or who knowingly advertises the availability of such
communications."  Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(2)). 
Nor is this defense available to "a person who provides access or
connection to a facility, system, or network engaged in the
violation . . . that is owned or controlled by such person."  Id.
(to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(3)).  The level or nature
of control is not defined.

<p>92.  In addition, the Act provides a defense to a
criminal prosecution under (a)(1)(B) or (d), or under (a)(2) for
use of a facility for an activity under (a)(1)(B), if the
defendant
<blockquote>(A)   has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective,
and appropriate actions under the circumstances to
restrict or prevent access by minors to a communication
specified in such subsections, which may involve any
appropriate measures to restrict minors from such
communications, including any method which is feasible
under available technology; or

<p>(B)   has restricted access to such communication by
requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account,
adult access code, or adult personal identification
number.</blockquote>

Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(5)).  Congress did not
provide any details as to what might be considered a "good faith,
reasonable, effective, and appropriate action[]."  Congress did
allow the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") to promulgate
nonbinding guidelines as to what might be an "appropriate
action," but it now appears that even those guidelines will not
be issued until sometime in 1997 at the earliest, and compliance
with the guidelines will not insulate speakers from prosecution
or conviction under the Act.

<p>93.  Congress made no findings in connection with
enacting Section 502 of the Act.  Congress made no findings as to
its purpose or interest in criminalizing online communication of
"indecent" or "patently offensive" materials to, or that would be
available to, persons under age 18.  In considering the Act,
Congress made no inquiry into or findings regarding the extent to
which such materials were available to persons under 18. 
Congress made no inquiry into or findings whether the means
Congress chose to address whatever interest it had would
substantially further that interest.  Congress made no inquiry
into or findings whether any less restrictive means would
substantially further its interest.

<p>94.  In another section of the Act, however, Congress
did make the following relevant findings:
<blockquote>(1) The rapidly developing array of Internet and
other interactive computer services available to
individual Americans represent an <strong>extraordinary advance</strong>
in the availability of <strong>educational and informational
resources</strong> to our citizens.
<p>(2) <strong>These services offer users a great degree of
control over the information that they receive</strong>, as well
as the potential for even greater control in the future
as technology develops.
<p>(3) The Internet and other interactive computer
services offer a <strong>forum</strong> for a true diversity of
political discourse, <strong>unique</strong> opportunities for cultural
development, and myriad avenues for intellectual
activity.
<p>(4) The Internet and other interactive computer
services have flourished, to the benefit of all
Americans, with a minimum of government regulation.
<p>(5) Increasingly Americans are relying on
interactive media for a variety of political,
educational, cultural, and entertainment services.</blockquote>
