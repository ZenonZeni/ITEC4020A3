<p align="center">March 23, 1995 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Alcohol Industry Association Hires Former
Head Of Drug Enforcement Administration</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">John C. Lawn, the former head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) has been appointed as Chairman and CEO of
the &quot;Century Council,&quot; which is described in the
March/April issue of <i>Healthy Drinking</i> magazine as being
&quot;the most prominent of the hundreds of programs supported by
the licensed beverage industry.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The appointment is seen as an extension of the efforts of the
alcohol industry to separate itself from the illegal drugs.&nbsp; <i>Healthy
Drinking</i>, supported by the alcohol industry, hails the
appointment, &quot;anxiously&quot; hoping that Lawn's connections
in the prohibitionist propaganda industry will help de-couple
alcohol from other drugs in prohibitionist propaganda. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The magazine wrongly states that the DEA has &quot;scrupulously
avoided confusing use with abuse and drinking with drugging, a
stance which seems beyond the ken of other federal agencies like Health
and Human Services.&quot;&nbsp; The alcohol industry seems
unaware that the DEA is now claiming that alcohol prohibition was
a success.&nbsp; For example, an official 1994 DEA publication,
&quot;How to Hold Your Own in A Drug Legalization Debate&quot;
(page 29) cites two prohibitionists who claim that alcohol
prohibition worked because it reduced alcohol consumption.&nbsp;
The Michigan Drug Czar Robert Peterson is quoted as saying that
&quot;Since the repeal of Prohibition, alcohol consumption has tripled.&quot;&nbsp;
This sort of statement is common in prohibitionist
propaganda.&nbsp; Much of the hard core constituency of drug
prohibition <i>also</i> supports alcohol prohibition -- but they
generally keep it low key. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, the magazine approvingly quotes Lawn using a standard
DEA line: &quot;Illicit drugs .... are illegal because they are
dangerous.&quot;&nbsp; Does this indicate that the alcohol
industry is betting its future on the assertion that alcohol is <u>not</u>
&quot;dangerous&quot; by the standards of a government that is waging
a war on marijuana, which by every objective measure is far less
dangerous than alcohol? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Richard Cowan, the National Director of NORML, said that
&quot;the appointment of Lawn is not only cynical and
hypocritical, but also very misguided.&nbsp; The alcohol industry
is not going to protect itself from the prohibitionists by
pretending that alcohol isn't a drug.&nbsp; Lawn may well be able
to marginally influence some of the prohibitionist propaganda or
legislation passed by alcohol using (and abusing) legislators,
but this is more likely to lull the alcohol industry into
unwarranted complacency rather than to protect them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The alcohol and tobacco industries need to learn that their best
protection from the therapeutic state is to tell the truth about
freedom and stop trying to pretend that their products aren't
'drugs.'&nbsp; Further, does the alcohol industry really want to
declare war on its natural allies in the anti-prohibitionist
movement in order to appease the prohibitionists who have them
next on their lists?&nbsp; Who is advising the alcohol industry
on this, the ghost of Neville Chamberlin?&nbsp; Or perhaps the
ghost of Harry Anslinger?&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Special Announcement</u></b><b>: ABC News
Special To Focus On The 'War on Drugs'</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><u>ABC News will air a special program, &quot;America's War On
Drugs: Searching For Solutions&quot;, on Thursday, April 6, 1995,
10:00 - 11:00 PM, ET.</u> <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a one-hour news special, ABC News correspondent Catherine
Crier [a former Felony Chief Prosecutor and a State Civil
District Judge, 162nd District-Dallas County, TX -ed.] examines some
controversial alternatives to the 'War on Drugs' model: the
decriminalization or legalization of some drugs, and &quot;harm
reduction&quot; -- the treatment of addicts with drugs and
therapy rather than incarceration. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The hour takes Crier to cities around the country, and to Europe,
where tactics that to many appear risky and dangerous are
currently employed.&nbsp; Should and could they be successfully
used here?&nbsp; Experts -- and addicts -- offer their thoughts. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Federal Execution Delayed For Convicted
Marijuana &quot;Kingpin&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 22, <i>The Washington Times</i> reported that in
Birmingham, Alabama, &quot;A judge yesterday blocked the
execution of a drug kingpin nine days before he was to become the
first person put to death by the U.S. government since 1963. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defense attorney Natasha Zalkins said new and &quot;very
sensitive&quot; evidence had come to light that proved David
Ronald Chandler's innocence.&nbsp; U.S. District Judge James H.
Hancock ruled additional time was needed to consider the
evidence. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Chandler, 42,...had been scheduled to die by injection March 30
at the federal prison in Terre Haute, IN. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Nearly Fifty Percent Of Coloradans Approve
Of Hemp Cultivation</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 20, The <i>Denver Post</i> ran a telephone poll of
Colorado residents in which they asked numerous political
questions.&nbsp; One of which was: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Should Colorado] allow the growing of industrial grade hemp,
that is, plants that have virtually no intoxication value? </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><tt>Favor.............48% <br>
    Oppose............28% <br>
    Undecided.........25% </tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><b>Brazil May Decriminalize Personal Use Of
Marijuana!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 19, The Associated Press (AP) reports that &quot;From
the Amazon jungle to Ipanema beach, marijuana is part of a daily
routine for many Brazilians. Routine, but illegal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now, for the first time, the country is seriously discussing a
proposal to end jail time and fines for the use and possession of
the drug. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>AP</i> reports that Congress is scheduled to vote on
decriminalization by July.&nbsp; Attorney General Nelson Jobim is
lobbying for the bill.&nbsp; &quot;It's absurd,&quot; to put
users in jail Jobim said in an interview. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under current law, marijuana users can be sentenced to 2 to 3
years in prison for possessing as little as 20 grams of
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>AP</i>, three South American nations --
Argentina, Uruguay and Venezuela -- already have systems similar
to the one proposed by Jobim, while the possession of small
amounts of marijuana is completely legal in Columbia and Peru. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Decriminalization] has even been endorsed by Cardinal Lucas
Moreira Neves, the conservative Roman Catholic archbishop of
Salvador and primate of Brazil. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>AP</i> reports that for many Brazilians, the government is
simply recognizing a practice that is too widespread to be
suppressed [When will the U.S. government acknowledge this?
-ed.]. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>[On March 23, NORML's National Director Richard Cowan and
staff met with Brazilian Judge Marco Da Silva, Advisor to the
President of the Sao Paulo State Supreme Court, on the matter of
marijuana decriminalization.&nbsp; NORML will endorse the attempts
in Brazil to decriminalize marijuana and demonstrate, to the
judge and his contingent, the success' of marijuana
decriminalization in eleven states in America and especially in
The Netherlands.]</b> </p>
