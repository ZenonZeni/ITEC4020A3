<H2>Company Overview:</H2>
<P>Terrapin is a privately held pharmaceutical discovery company which has achieved considerable success in establishing:</P>
<UL>
<LI> A proprietary, enabling technology for rapidly identifying novel,
small-molecule therapeutic compounds.
</LI>
<LI> Product leads offering significant competitive advantages&#150;&#150;including TER199 and TER286 for use in the fields of oncology/hematology, and a family of small molecules for the treatment of diabetes.
</LI>
<LI> An innovative exploratory program focused on novel disease targets and novel product candidates for major T-cell-mediated immunological diseases and disorders.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>Terrapin&#146;s mission is to build a portfolio of novel pharmaceuticals that address important medical needs in sizable markets. Utilizing its patented molecular fingerprinting technology, the Company has already identified several
small-molecule product leads which have proven biological activity against key disease mechanisms. The most significant of these are TER199, which addresses the $1 billion colony stimulating factor market in oncology/hematology, and the diabetes compounds which could lead to a major advance in the $3 billion diabetes market. In addition, the Company&#146;s
exploratory program in T-cell regulation is leading to broad therapeutic opportunities in the multi-billion dollar autoimmune disease, transplantation and asthma markets.</P>
<P>To commercialize its drug discoveries, Terrapin intends to establish corporate partnerships and, where appropriate, to retain U.S. rights to molecules it wants to develop for its own portfolio. Discussions are currently in progress with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, with the goal of entering into collaborative and/or licensing arrangements on initial product leads. This strategy will allow the Company to pursue a number of drug discovery projects simultaneously, maximizing the value of its technology while also
taking advantage of the clinical trial, marketing and distribution
infrastructure of its partners.</P>  
<H2>Program Overview:</H2> 
<H3> Oncology/Hematology</H3>
<P>TER199 &#150;&#150; This novel, orally active molecule has been shown in preclinical (in vivo) studies to accelerate the reappearance of circulatingneutrophils, platelets, erythrocytes and lymphocytes following their suppression by chemotherapeutic agents. TER199 thus has the potential of being used in placeof colony stimulating factors in all clinical applications&#150;&#150;such as the rescue of myelosuppression following chemotherapy, the treatment of
neutropenia, and the transplantation of bone marrow&#150;&#150;while also having the advantage of oral bioavailability. In addition, TER199 offers the opportunity to provide the potential benefits of MGDF and TPO for platelet growth and the treatment of thrombocytopenia. Terrapin expects to file its Investigational New Drug application in 1996 to initiate human clinical studies in cancer patients. </P>
<P>TER286 &#150;&#150; A tumor-activated compound, TER286 only becomes toxic when encountering elevated levels of glutathione S-transferase (GST) isozymes. GSTs have been shown to be responsible for drug resistance, and levels of certain GSTs are elevated in difficult-to-treat cancers such as lung, ovarian and breast cancer. TER286<B> </B>has exhibited excellent efficacy in animal tumor model systems and in primary human tumor cells in culture, often outperforming currently used products such as taxol, cisplatin and fluorouracil. In animals, TER286 also exhibits significantly reduced bone marrow toxicity compared to currently available therapies. To develop TER286, Terrapin intends to establish a strategic alliance with a corporate partner that can bring the product to market as part of a portfolio of cancer-fighting agents.</P> 
<H3> Diabetes</H3>
<P>Terrapin scientists have discovered a family of small molecules which directly activate the human insulin receptor. These molecules offer the potential to regulate both insulin and blood glucose levels with oral therapy. The Company&#146;s most promising diabetes lead has been shown to interact directly with the insulin receptor and to potentiate insulin&#146;s action in intact cell studies. Further validating this treatment approach, Terrapin has demonstrated a lowering of blood glucose and circulating insulin levels in preclinical (in vivo) models of type II (adult onset) diabetes. Terrapin plans to apply its medicinal chemistry expertise, alone or with a strategic partner, to identify a novel compound based on its leads for entry into human clinical studies. </P> 
<H3> Immunology</H3>
<P>The discovery and development of safe and effective agents for the treatment of chronic inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune conditions represents a broad scientific and commercial opportunity for Terrapin. Company research has led to newly discovered intracellular proteins that provide the mechanistic basis for regulating T-cell activities. These intracellular proteins offer the promise of much-needed molecular specificity for controlling inflammation &#150;&#150; without the toxicity common with other immunosuppressives. The Company&#146;s work centers on both novel molecular targets and novel product candidates, initially for the treatment of autoimmune disease, transplant rejection and asthma.</P>  
<H2>Proprietary Drug Discovery Technology</H2>  
<P>The Company&#146;s innovative molecular fingerprinting technology, known as TRAP&#153;, has been the driving force for the success of Terrapin&#146;s projects. This powerful technology is designed to accelerate drug discovery and early product development activities that currently represent major productivity bottlenecks for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Moreover, it allows
the discovery of drug candidates from large chemical libraries at an
unprecedented level of efficiency.</P>
<P>TRAP classifies small molecules by distinct computer-readable patterns, or &#147;molecular fingerprints,&#148; based on specific protein-binding characteristics. By computationally screening its large database of highly diverse chemicals, Terrapin can rapidly identify compounds that are likely to interact with a given disease target. Unlike other computer screening techniques, TRAP is distinctive in being able to search among compounds with vastly different chemical
structures, based on properties directly relevant to potential pharmaceutical utility. Furthermore, TRAP can predict functional relationships without prior knowledge of the structure of either the molecule or the disease target. As a result, scientists can identify medically relevant lead compounds without depleting precious supplies of rare materials and can intelligently apply sophisticated modern chemistry, such as combinatorial chemistry and computer modeling of molecules, to develop novel product candidates. </P>
<P>Protecting its technology, Terrapin has established a strong proprietary position with patents and trade secrets. Fourteen patents have been issued or allowed, protecting the core technology, composition of matter and use. Numerous additional patent applications are pending.</P>
<H2>Investors: </H2>
<P>Since its inception, Terrapin has raised over $35 million in funding from both venture capital and private investors. Venture investors include Burr, Egan, Deleage &amp; Co.; Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer; Oxford Bioscience Partners; Advent International; Delphi Bioventures; Hambrecht &amp; Quist Capital Management; Alpha Partners; MDS Health Ventures Capital Corp., GIMV and Sofinnova. Private investors include the Swanson Family Fund Ltd. and Dr. Alejandro Zaffaroni.</P>
<P><B>Founded: </B>1986</P>
<P><B>First Round Venture Funding:</B> 1991</P>
<P><B>Business Strategy and Corporate Partnering Opportunities</B>:</P>
<P>One of the key strengths of Terrapin&#146;s technology is that it can be applied to a wide range of small-molecule drug discovery and development projects. At the same time, it has broad applicability beyond therapeutics to a variety of other commercial arenas. Terrapin has chosen to concentrate on innovative human therapeutics that address significant market needs and to recognize value in other areas, where appropriate, through out-license or spin-off.</P>
<P>In addition to building its own therapeutic portfolio, Terrapin expects to collaborate with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies which are exploring their own disease-related targets. Terrapin believes that the ability of its technology to rapidly qualify targets of opportunity, discover therapeutic leads and optimize product candidates increases the probability of finding a compound
of significant therapeutic and commercial value. Currently, through an agreement with Japan Tobacco Inc., Terrapin is using its TRAP technology to create a fingerprint database for a highly diverse chemical library of 20,000 compounds. In addition, through agreements with a number of biotechnology companies, Terrapin is using its TRAP technology to detect compounds in its own diverse library that are active against targets of interest to its collaborators.</P>
