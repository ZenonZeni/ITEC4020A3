<H2>CEOS assesses Global Observing Strategy</H2>
<H3><HR></H3>
<BR>
About 50 leading scientists and space agency officials met in Seattle, Washington
State USA, 27&shyp;29 March 1996, to consider the advancement of an international
strategy for long-term global observation measurements required for climate
change studies, disaster monitoring, and other research or operational needs.
<BR>
<BR>
The Seattle meeting, formally titled the 'Ad Hoc Meeting on Space Component
for an Integrated Global Observing Strategy', was convened by the Committee
on Earth Observation Satellites, CEOS (see Box), and hosted by the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA). Dr Brian Embleton, Head of CSIRO Office
of Space Science &amp; Applications/Earth Observation Centre, was the chair
throughout the 3-day meeting. <BR>

<P>The main aim of the gathering was to consider how the international community
might best meet future needs for global measurements of natural phenomena.
In particular, the meeting considered how space-based observations might
be better planned and co-ordinated, in order to meet the research and operational
needs of international programs such as the Global Ocean Observing System
(GOOS), the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and the International
Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP). <BR>
<BR>
Amongst other items, the meeting paid special attention to how user requirements
might be specified and incorporated into the Earth observation activities
of CEOS members; the potential role of CEOS in a future Integrated Global
Observing Strategy; and the interdependencies of satellite operators; service
users; and space-based and local measurement.<BR>
<BR>
Later in the year, in September at Geneva, a related ad hoc meeting will
consider the co-ordination of local or 'in situ' measurements, for similar
purposes. This meeting will be convened by GCOS. For continuity and integration,
the organising committee will share several members with the group which
organised the Seattle meeting. <BR>

<BR>
The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites was formed in 1984, and is
dedicated to optimising the benefits of Earth observation, acting as a focal
point for mission co-ordination; and exchanging policy and technical information
about Earth observation programs, missions, and data systems. Further information
about CEOS can be found on the CEOS Information System, at <BR>

<H4><A NAME="anchor5157392"></A>NASDA and CSIRO renew agreement</H4>
<BR>
During the Seattle meeting, CSIRO and the National Space Development Agency
of Japan (NASDA) finalised an amendment to their agreement on the direct
reception and distribution of MOS-1 data. The initial agreement, signed
in 1987 and subsequently amended twice, allows for commercial distribution
of the Marine Observation Satellite (MOS) data, received on behalf of CSIRO
in Australia by the Australian Centre for Remote Sensing.<BR>
<BR>
The new amendment, effective from 1 April 1996, moves the emphasis of the
co-operative project towards non-commercial research use. <BR>
