</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">After a decade of spiraling narcotics
addiction in England, the trend was reversed in 1970. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The British narcotics problem admittedly is
minor when compared with that of the United States. England had
never counted more than 3,000 narcotics addicts; estimates in the
United States range from 150,000 to 250,000. However, while
American drug experts warn of a continuously growing number of
addicts, Britain's Home Office recently reported a drop of almost
8 per cent, the first since the drug problem became a serious
national concern.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The slowdown had already begun in 1969, when
the annual increase of addicts was held to a trickle, one year
after the government tightened its narcotics policies by limiting
the prescribing of heroin to staff physicians of government-run
drug clinics. Previously, any general physician was permitted to
prescribe heroin. Until the clinic system had been operating for
a year, the number of narcotics addicts in England doubled every
-sixteen months. The reversal of this trend has been accompanied
by a significant drop in new addicts. In 1968, a total of 1,476
previously unknown cases were reported. In 1969, the figure was
1,030, and by 1970 it had dropped to 711.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">These encouraging figures, however, concern
only a part of the British drug-abuse problem, albeit the
toughest and the one over which there is the most public concern.
But addicts and abusers of amphetamines and barbiturates are not
included in this count. Furthermore, there is a far greater and
increasing army of marijuana and hashish users, for which there
is no accurate tally.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But, while the latest statistics may give the
English drug scene a more optimistic appearance than it deserves,
the bizarre anecdotes that have been published in both the
English and American press may have colored the past picture with
more despair than is justified.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the twitching kaleidoscope that is
Picadilly Circus, the scene is as harsh and distorted as the
electric letters that flash their spasmodic messages from high
about the throng. The pallid young addicts, staggering out of
doorways to panhandle enough for a fix, casting furtive glances
at passersby while pills or other drugs are exchanged . . . a jab
of a needle in the toilet of the Underground ... a hypodermic
protruding between the toes of a grimy, infected foot . . . a
spurt of fresh blood on a soiled shirt . . . a young girl
collapsing in a doorway after taking a barbiturate injection.
It's all there and more.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">These scenes may have become part of the
tourist attractions of London's Times Square, but they don't
reflect accurately the addiction problem in England. Although it
is risky to offer findings in the complex and often-disputed
field of drug addiction, some basic trends are clear:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin addiction is no longer the major
&quot;hard&quot; drug problem in England. The rising tide of new
heroin addicts has been stopped and, in fact, has significantly
receded. The quantity of heroin prescribed in government clinics
continues to decline. Methadone is the most frequently used drug
in England today and is replacing heroin. But the drop in heroin
is not fully matched by the rise in methadone. New addicts tend
to be addicted to methadone rather than heroin, but the number of
newcomers addicted to anything is smaller than in previous years.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Methadone maintenance generally is not
practiced in England as it is in the United States, in that far
more English addicts inject methadone than take it orally.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">British hard-drug users often are polyaddicts,
injecting a variety of drugs, obtained both legally and
illegally. The most recent craze is the injection of
barbiturates, a particularly damaging habit that has raised the
concerns of all those working in the British drug field.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the backbone of the English drug
program is the government-sponsored clinic, where addicts obtain
free drugs, the phrase &quot;British clinic system&quot; is
misleading. There is very little system to the clinics beyond the
fact that they all prescribe narcotics. Clinics vary widely in
services offered, treatment approach, staff, and facilities.
Nevertheless, the clinics are credited widely with curbing the
heroin problem, while the degree of their contribution to the
problem of methadone addiction is debated. Furthermore, clinics
are considered to have had an impact on improving the total
hard-drug picture, but evidence for this generally is subjective
rather than objective and statistical.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although there is some black-market activity
in all drugs, it appears to be on neither a major nor a very
professional scale. No one interviewed claimed that there was a
vast, hidden opiate-addict population supplying itself from the
black market.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">No one in England saw any correlation between
drug addiction and a rise in crime.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Finally, the commonly held view in the United
States that heroin addiction automatically turns the user into a
completely antisocial, unproductive misfit is simply not shared
in England. Many English addicts hold regular jobs. Estimates of
employment of all known addicts range from 40 to 50 per cent.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">But perhaps to find the most glaring
difference between the two countries, you have to go back to the
hurlyburly of Picadilly Circus. There, in a locked cabinet on a
medicine shelf at Boots the Chemist, which attracts a
disproportionate number of addicts because it is open all night,
you can find heroin tablets in small bottles. A printed-in-red
retail price list says:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin 100 tablets 18 S.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At the 1970 rate of exchange, this is $2.16.
On New York's streets, the retail price for the same amount of
heroin can run as high as $1,000.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">BACKGROUND<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Unlike the United States, England has
consistently treated drug addiction as a medical problem. Even
while moving toward more restrictive policies in the drug-abuse
field, the nation has never wavered from this medical point of
view. &quot;The addict should be regarded as a sick person, he
should be treated as such and not as a criminal, provided that he
does not resort to criminal acts,&quot;' said the Brain
Committee, which formulated the first significant changes in the
country's drug laws seven years ago.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Hard-drug abuse in England, also unlike the
United States, became a problem only in the last ten years or so,
as Table 7-1 clearly indicates. In 1954, the first year
nationwide heroin statistics were available, there were only 54
identified heroin addicts. The majority of the 335 known drug
addicts that year, a total of 179, were addicted to morphine, and
most were women. Also, the majority of these addicts had become
addicted after receiving a narcotic to relieve pain related to a
lengthy illness. Among the few nontherapeutic addicts, a high
proportion were doctors and nurses 'who had experimented with
narcotics and subsequently became hooked.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Today, of course, the numbers, the reasons for
addiction, and the average addict age (see Table 7-2)<b> </b>have
all changed. For example, only 2<b> </b>per cent of the reported
addicts in 1968 were classified as therapeutic. Among heroin
addicts that year, 32<b> </b>per cent were under twenty years of
age. Men outnumbered women by more than 3<b> </b>to 1.<br>

<p> <font size="2">England differs from the United States again
in that its addicts today are not as a rule from disadvantaged
families, are not members of minority groups, and do not
&quot;turn on&quot; to blot out the economic dispair of the
ghetto. <b>&quot;On </b>the contrary,&quot; says Dr. David V.
Hawks, <b>a </b>key staff member of the Addiction Research Unit
of London's Institute of Psychiatry; &quot;those notified in the
1960's were often construed as 'middle class dropouts' whose
addiction, far from being explicable in terms of some material
disadvantage, appears to have been motivated by the deliberate
rejection of middle-class norms <b>and </b>opportunities.&quot; <br>

<p> <font size="1">* Beginning with 1969, this figure includes
addicts to heroin and/or methadone.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="img00028.gif"><font size="1"> </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This does not mean that the poor have escaped
heroin addiction. They have not. But they aren't-by any count-in
the majority.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The basic guidelines for Britain's drug-abuse
policy were established in 1926, a dozen years after America
passed the Harrison Act, which set the stage for the U.S.
addict-criminal doctrine. A committee chaired by Sir Humphrey
Rolleston, a prominent English physician, turned the problem over
to doctors and steered it away from the police. The Rolleston
committee said that doctors should be allowed to prescribe
narcotics to wean patients off these drugs, to relieve pain after
a prolonged cure had failed, and in cases where small doses
enabled otherwise helpless patients to perform useful tasks and
lead relatively normal lives.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Rolleston Committee's findings were the
basis of British drug policy for almost forty years. They were
reaffirmed in general in 1961 by the Interdepartmental Committee
on Drug Addiction, chaired by Sir Russell Brain. However, the
addiction statistics began to move upward, the Brain Committee
was reconvened, and a second report was issued on July 31, 1965.
It recommended the first significant restrictions on the
prescribing of heroin and cocaine.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The report succinctly stated the motivation
and fears behind England's drug policies and their sharp
differences with those of the United States: </font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>We have borne in mind the dilemma which faces the
    authorities responsible for the control of dangerous drugs in
    this country. If there is insufficient control it may lead to
    the spread of addictionas is happening at present. If, on the
    other hand, the restrictions are so severe as to prevent or
    seriously discourage the addict from obtaining any supplies
    from legitimate sources, [they] may lead to the development
    of an organized illicit traffic. The absence hitherto of such
    an organized illicit traffic has been attributed largely to
    the fact that an addict has been able to obtain supplies of
    drugs legally. But this facility has now been abused, with
    the result that addiction has increased.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">The Brain Committee recommended the following
changes:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. &quot;All addicts to dangerous drugs should be notified
    to a central authority.&quot; (This authority later became
    the Chief Medical Officer of the Home Office.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. &quot;To treat addicts a number of special treatment
    centers should be established, especially in the London
    area.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>3. &quot;There should be powers for compulsory detention
    of addicts in these centers.&quot; (This recommendation later
    was rejected by the Minister of Health.) </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>4. &quot;The prescribing of heroin and cocaine to addicts
    should be limited to doctors on the staff of these treatment
    centers.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>5. &quot;It should be a statutory offence for other
    doctors to prescribe heroin and cocaine to an addict.&quot;<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">The government accepted these recommendations
and incorporated them in the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1967. In
February, 1968, the compulsory notification of addicts went into
effect. By April of that year, heroin and cocaine prescribing was
restricted to doctors in the newly created treatment centers. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">During the almost three years that passed
between the committee's report and the effective date of its
recommendations, harddrug addiction soared. From 1964, the latest
year for which a full year's statistics were available to the
committee, to 1967, heroin addicts alone increased fourfold, from
342 to 1,299. A year later, the heroin-addict figure reached
2,240.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The committee's concern that
&quot;insufficient control may lead to the spread of
addiction&quot; was more than confirmed. Although it is unjust to
blame the British medical profession alone for the sharp rise in
addiction, the fact is that general over-prescribing and the
activities of a few medical charlatans fueled the craving for
heroin.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Some addicts were receiving prescriptions from
general practitioners for as much as 20 or more grains of heroin
a day (1,200 milligrams). Very few addicts used that amount
themselves (a dosage, incidentally, that would kill almost any
American adult). Most beneficiaries of overprescribing doctors
sold their surplus and, of course, addicted others. What is
surprising is that the Disciplinary Committee of the General
Medical Council, the policing arm of the British medical
profession, permitted this situation to continue as long at it
did.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The problem of overprescribing doctors, with
strong hints that their conduct was ethically questionable, was
discussed in print as early as 1965 in the public report of the
Brain Committee:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>From the evidence before us we have been led to the
    conclusion that the major source of supply has been the
    activity of a very few doctors who have prescribed
    excessively for addicts. Thus we were informed that in 1962
    one doctor alone prescribed almost 600,000 tablets (6 million
    milligrams or 6 kilos) of heroin for addicts <font size="1">.3
    </font>The same doctor, on one occasion, prescribed 900
    tablets (9,000 milligrams) of heroin to one addict and three
    days later prescribed for the same patient another 600
    tablets (6,000 milligrams) &quot;to replace pills lost in an
    accident.&quot; Two doctors each issued a single prescription
    for 1,000 tablets (10,000 milligrams).<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">Overprescribing was so extensive during the
years after the Brain Committee report and before the opening of
the clinics that pure, British-manufactured heroin was readily
and relatively inexpensively available on the black market, where
imported, illicit heroin was virtually unknown. While prices for
all consumer products rose during this period, black-market
heroin-the overprescribed surplus-held the line against inflation
and stayed at one pound sterling a grain. This meant that, for
$2.40 a day, an addict could support a heroin habit. (Today,
incidentally, British manufactured heroin is both relatively
scarce and expensive on the black market, with a sixfold increase
to six pounds, or $14.40 a grain.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One psychiatrist, reviewing the years
immediately preceding the opening of the clinics, felt that
general practitioners were overprescribing to such an extent
that, for every two addicts receiving prescriptions, at least one
other was maintaining his habit from these supplies. Another
psychiatrist believed that about a third of the reported addicts
were not <i>bona fide </i>addicts at all but were merely sometime
heroin users who conned doctors into issuing regular
prescriptions that they would then sell.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But a few doctors clearly had not been
sweet-talked by addicts into writing too-generous prescriptions.
They had purposely turned the narcotics problem into a lucrative
enterprise with the simple stroke of a pen. They wrote
prescriptions for pay-at a going rate of one pound to two pounds
per script. These were the junkie doctors whose names can be
found in almost every London clinic's case records.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">One of them, a dermatologist with a passion
for gambling, ended his prescribing days issuing orders from a
taxi parked in front of the Baker Street Tube Station. He was
nabbed on a technicality-failing to keep proper narcotics
records-spent a short period in jail, and finally had his license
to practice revoked by the General Medical Council after numerous
complaints of his activities from druggists and Home Office
officials. Another was reported to have issued prescriptions to
140 addicts with a daily average of 6 to 8 grains at the height
of his narcotics enterprise. He is also without a medical license
today. He went to jail for conspiracy to commit murder.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While no one knowledgeable about the English
drug scene will say that the nation would not have had a
hard-drug problem had it not been for overprescribing doctors and
outright charlatans, there is consensus that overgenerous
prescriptions, whatever the doctor's motivation, helped
significantly to create the chaotic drug scene that the
government clinic program was expected to remedy.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">THE CLINICS<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1970, a monthly average of 1,154 drug
addicts obtained government-paid-for heroin and/or methadone and
a little cocaine from clinics scattered throughout England and
Wales. Recently, the clinic figures have remained relatively
stable, fluctuating by fewer than 100 addicts every month. The
number of new addicts registered with clinics dropped from a
monthly average of 66 to 41 in 1971. (See Table 7-3.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Nevertheless, it is risky to conclude that
this relative stability in clinic enrollment reflects containment
of drug addiction in England. Some clinics appear to have set a
quota of addicts and simply do not accept, or cannot accept, more
because of staff or</font><font size="1"> facility limitations.
The slow reduction in new addicts, however, is a hopeful sign.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <img src="img00029.gif"><font size="1"> <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">There are 14 clinics in London, which has four
fifths of the country's addicts. Elsewhere, an addict may obtain
drugs at 13 special facilities or at some 42 hospital outpatient
departments These are prepared to service an occasional addict as
part of their regular outpatient program.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The special clinics vary in every conceivable
way-in type of </font><font size="2">facility, size of patient
load, size of staff, treatment approach, and prescribing
philosophy. There is no central authority over the clinics to
provide specific guidelines for staffing or determine treatment
or prescribing policies. Because of this, it is a mistake to
refer to the English &quot;drug clinic system.&quot; There is no
common &quot;system&quot; beyond the fact that addicts may obtain
heroin and methadone from government-supported clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Each clinic director is doing &quot;his own
thing,&quot; based on his own particular approach to drug
addiction. He works with the facility, staff, and budget he was
able to get from his own hospital and Regional Hospital Board,
the governing body that supervises medical care for a given area.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">These various approaches have not been
evaluated comparatively for cost or effectiveness. The addicts,
however, are usually in agreement about which are the
&quot;best&quot; clinics in a less than scientific rating system,
which might be called the &quot;Santa Claus&quot; scale. It ranks
candidates on their drug-prescribing generosity.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The lack of central direction is the result
not of careless management but rather of design. Americans often
have the impression that the British National Health Service is a
monolith that dictates everything from aspirin dispensing to
appendix removing, but the fact is that the government's Ministry
of Health has approached physicians both within and outside of
the National Health Service with the circumspection of an
impresario dealing with a diva.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">After the government accepted most of the
second Brain Committee recommendations and prepared the necessary
legislation to implement them, the Department of Health and
Social Security issued a memorandum to Regional Hospital Boards
and hospital governing groups.' The Ministry directed its memo
particularly at mental hospitals and psychiatric departments of
general hospitals. As a result, today the clinic directors are
psychiatrists, most of whom follow a general psychiatric practice
in addition to their interests in the drug field.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Health Department memorandum included a
list of the known addicts in each Regional Hospital area. Since
most addicts were in the London area, it asked city hospitals
with psychiatric departments to plan for drug clinics. At the
same time, the Health Department asked hospitals to set up
inpatient beds for withdrawal treatment and to assess addicts who
would obtain their drugs as outpatients for the required dosage.
Today most clinics have such beds available to them.
Significantly, the &quot;how&quot;<b> </b>of operating clinics
was not described.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The decision to supply an addict with drugs
and whether to seek to substitute other drugs, the assessment of
dosage, and the method of supply rest with the clinician. It is
to be expected, however, that where possible, the dosage will be
determined by assessment during inpatient observation and that
this will usually be offered, though continued treatment cannot
be made conditional on acceptance. [This in-hospital assessment
is rarely done today, and it is clear that most clinic directors
reject this Health Department &quot;expectation.&quot;] The
organization of services will depend on the method of supplying
drugs that is adopted by clinicians. It is, however, desirable in
any area that there should be a fairly uniform approach;
otherwise, the organization of services and the sharing of the
load will be obstructed because addicts will gravitate to those
clinics where they think drugs are easiest to get. While direct
administration of drugs by the medical staff of the treatment
center is not excluded, supply by the hospital or by retail
prescription is likely to be more generally practicable.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinics have certain statistical reporting
obligations, both to the Health Department and the Home Office.
There is an exchange of views and information among clinic
directors and other medical staff members at periodic meetings
called by the Health Department. A department official told me
that these meetings generally are held every two months, but the
records show that such sessions are usually held on an irregular
basis. Minutes of the meetings indicate that not all clinics are
represented at every meeting and not every clinic director
attends regularly. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">FACILITIES<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The differences between clinics is apparent
from inspection of their physical facilities. In the naval-base
city of Portsmouth, the clinic is in a large general hospital
tucked behind a door marked &quot;Dental Waiting Room.&quot; In
East London, the center is in its own building on the grounds of
a mental hospital. In the Denmark Hill area, it is part of the
hospital's general outpatient department.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If you visit St. Giles Clinic in the Church of
England Community Center, you are reminded of an Alec Guinness
movie. Dr. James H. Willis, a young psychiatrist, holds court
resplendent in a white medical coat, seated behind a large wooden
table in a room marked &quot;Lecture Hall.&quot; He is flanked by
two pianos and a bass fiddle. Above and behind his head, a brass
plaque reads: &quot;The trustees of St. Giles Center gratefully
acknowledge the generous support given by the Rotary Club of
Camberwell.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It is doubtful that the Rotarians would rush
to support the effort now going on in the lecture hall. It is
lack of such support that has prevented Dr. Willis from using a
new $192,000 building specifically constructed for his drug
clinic by the two hospitals and the Regional Hospital Board
sponsoring it. The building, which includes eight single rooms
for inpatient assessment, stood empty for more than a year after
it was completed. Public protest -exploited by local
politicians-forced the hospital to rescind its decision to bring
young addicts into the middle-class neighborhood of St. Giles.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">In his churchly retreat, Dr. Willis has no
facilities even for basic medical examinations, and patients
leave urine specimens in the center's men's room. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">STAFFING<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A most basic difference among clinics is in
the kind and size of staff that operate them. One of the most
significant contrasts is between St. Clement and Lambeth Hospital
Clinics. The staffing patterns are as follows:<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <i><font size="2">LAMBETH </font></i><font size="2">(96
active patients) <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1 <b>31/2 </b>days a week</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Nurse:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1 full time</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Secretary:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <i><font size="2">ST. CLEMENT </font></i><font size="2">(71

</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1 full time</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1 1 </font><b><font size="1">1/2 </font></b><font
size="2">days a week</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I psychiatric intern 1 </font><font size="1">1/2
</font><font size="2">days a week</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Social workers:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2 full time</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Nurses:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">10 full time</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Secretary: 1<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The nurses at St. Clement function like social
workers: they counsel patients and make home calls both to
patients and to their families, relatives, or close friends.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The Lambeth Clinic, run by Dr. Thomas H.
Bewley, a wellknown author of medical articles on the English
drug scene, is far closer to the English clinic prototype.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The besieged Dr. Willis at St. Giles,
incidentally, was even worse off when it came to staffing. With
75 active patients and 64 inactive patients, the clinic included
three doctors, two full time and another one-third time. Although
there were two slots for social workers, both were temporarily
empty. Dr. Willis has no nursing help. His only other assistance
comes from a secretary and a hospital porter, who acts as
factotum around his piano-flanked emporium.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Clement, in terms of staff time for the
addict, is clearly exceptional. It was originally intended as a
day hospital where an addict would come for the entire day,
returning to his home only at night. The original staffing
pattern was retained when the clinic was turned into what can be
described more accurately as a day center that addicts of the
clinic may or may not attend. There is a ping-pong table, art
classes, and a &quot;fixing room&quot; where addicts can inject
themselves. Individual and group therapy sessions also are held
in the day center.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Among all London clinics, the amount of
social-work time provided to addicts varies from 475 hours per
week (St. Clement) to none, according to a questionnaire filled
out by the clinics themselves.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Because of the difference in staff time
between St. Clement and Lambeth, the addict's relationship to
these clinics is vastly different. At St. Clement, each social
worker and nurse has about ten cases. They know each addict by
his first name, and the easy, relaxed relationship that comes
with familiarity is evident. One addict, for example, came in to
show his nurse pictures of his recent wedding and to thank her
for her congratulatory telegram.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At Lambeth, the lone social worker, who
provides twenty hours a week, has a caseload of 30 addicts out of
the 96 active with the clinic. Of the 30, she estimated that she
has what she called <i>&quot;a </i>deep relationship&quot; with a
half dozen. &quot;They get a good half hour a week.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Of the clinic's work, she said: &quot;We're
containing it, regularizing it a bit; but, we're not treating it.
I think I do first aid a lot.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At St. Clement, staff members were slightly,
but not much, more encouraging. Not only did this clinic
represent the most concentrated staff effort with addicts, but
its patients resemble American ghetto addicts more closely than
any other London group.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Clement is a 128-bed mental hospital in
East London, an area that in terms of income and class-but not
color-can be compared to New York's Harlem or Bedford-Stuyvesant.
The addiction clinic of St. Clement serves patients from the
surrounding neighborhoods, the bleak row houses that bring to
mind a Charles Dickens novel. Eighty per cent of St. Clement's
addiction clinic customers are East End boys; the other 20 per
cent come from the far more affluent middle- and upper-class West
End.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While an estimated 10 per cent of the East End
population is colored (i.e., Negro, Indian, Pakistani), only one
of the clinic's 100 patients is half-Negro. This appears to
reflect accurately the fact that in England few
&quot;colored&quot; are involved with narcotic drugs.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinic is located on the hospital grounds
in a separate pre-fah building constructed especially for this
use at a cost of 14,000 pounds, or $33,600. The annual operating
cost for salaries and drugs is estimated by its director to be
about the same amount.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Psychiatrist John Denham is both clinic
director and head of the St. Clement Hospital. Much of the
day-to-day operation of the clinic fell on Dr. Margaret Tripp,
the full-time psychiatrist who served at the clinic from the
summer of 1968, when it opened, to 1971.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Neither Dr. Denham nor Dr. Tripp makes any
grand claims for the clinic, even though they, and it, have
received considerable publicity in U.S. media (Look magazine,
various television and radio networks). Dr. Denham has a thick
file of letters in response to this publicity requesting
permission to visit and interview him. He does not trade on this
notoriety.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">As is true of virtually all other clinics, St.
Clement's heroin dispensing is dropping monthly-from 214 grams in
March, 1969, to 73 grams in May, 1970. Methadone, both ampoules
for injection and oral, has increased at St. Clement, but not in
proportion to the drop in heroin. Dr. Denham attributes this
heroin reduction to the use of methadone, to more conservative
prescribing, and to greater expertise among clinic doctors. He
readily admits to the confusion that apparently hit every clinic
in the opening period of 1968. &quot;A drug addict presented
himself and said he needed six grains of heroin a day. We knew he
could do with two, but that he would settle for four. It was as
haphazard as that.29</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The same kind of candor is evident in a paper
published by Dr. P. H. Connell, another of the early pioneers in
drug-addiction control in England.' Reporting on 107 narcotics
users attending a London clinic between March, 1968, and
February, 1969, Dr. Connell acknowledged that some of these
patients had become addicted to drugs by the clinic.<br>

<p> <center><font size="1">REGISTRATION<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">How do you begin obtaining free drugs?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Some of the addicts interviewed are convinced
it is getting harder to get on the rolls. Some say that, for a
new addict to get on, be has to buy black-market narcotics for a
while and then show wicked withdrawal symptoms.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors discount the severity of these
statements but acknowledge that they are getting more
conservative. Interclinic monthly heroin and methadone
prescription quantities are distributed among the clinics, and
this may have developed a touch of competition to stay in the
range of low prescribers. At St. Clement, for example, a monthly
graph is kept showing its standing against the all-London
average.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Doctors agree that identifying an addict and
prescribing the correct quantity of drugs is the toughest part of
their jobs. They use words like &quot;haggling&quot; and
&quot;bargaining&quot; sessions to describe the difficulties of
deciding how much an addict should receive.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Health Department's suggestion of
in-hospital assessment before prescribing to addicts generally is
not part of the procedures of the London clinics. An occasional
applicant may be sent for observation for several days, but this
is the exception and not the rule.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In Portsmouth, however, Dr. Ian Christie will
not accept a new patient unless he agrees to three days of
hospitalization to determine the kind and size of his habit, or,
for that matter, if indeed he has one.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In London, addicts arriving at a clinic for
the first time, or to reapply, usually are given at least two
interviews. The first may be with a nurse or social worker and
the second with a clinic psychiatrist. After acceptance, addicts
generally report once every week to their psychiatrist or social
worker. Some are requested to come in several times a week, while
others, who may be more stable, are permitted to report every two
weeks.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Before acceptance, one, and sometimes several,
urine tests are scheduled, usually two or more days apart.
Drug-positive urine tests play a key role in the decision-making
process.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Urine tests, incidentally, are not regularly
scheduled for every addict after he has been accepted by a
clinic. Their frequency varies from clinic to clinic. At St.
Giles, Dr. Willis formerly demanded only sporadic urine tests.
Now, however, every patient gives a sample at each clinic visit.
In other clinics, it appears that tests are made when there is
some suspicion of other than clinic-prescribed drug use.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A key step in the preacceptance interview
procedure is the completion of a form outlining the addict's
biography, his drug history, and his physical characteristics.
This is sent to the Home Office, where it is compared with the
master list of registered addicts. The procedure helps to
identify previously unknown addicts and to prevent duplicate
registering at two or more clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Have addicts succeeded in getting on the rolls
of two different clinics? Yes, but how many or how often is
difficult to document. At St. Clement, Dr. Denham does not
remember a case where the Home Office check produced duplicate
registration. However, he does recall an incident indicating that
the problem is real. Not long after the clinic opened, a boy,
while stoned, told his fellow addicts that he was obtaining drugs
from two clinics. This came to the attention of the staff, and a
nurse was sent to the clinic closest to St. Clement. Seven
addicts were identified as St. Clement boys and five others
confessed to duplicate registration. At the time, this
represented 12 per cent of the St. Clement caseload.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">&quot;Did that surprise you?&quot; I asked Dr.
Denham.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">&quot;At the time, it annoyed me.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Connell, in his study of 107 drug users,
also found that four had been attending other clinics, where they
requested help without, of course, acknowledging the duplication.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">From observation, it appeared that a seasoned
addict with a long Home Office or clinic record, or both, had
much less difficulty in re-registering at a clinic than a
previous &quot;unknown.&quot; Dr. Bewley permitted me to sit in
on a series of interviews with addicts applying to the Lambeth
clinic. All had been previously interviewed by the clinic's
part-time psychiatrists, who also sat in on these second
interviews.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">My notes for this session are as follows:</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">1. Male, out of prison since May 1. Was with
Lambeth a year ago, had received 200 mg. daily of heroin and
methadone; long criminal record, most recent possession of
burglar tools, <i>cannabis; </i>told to return for urine test.
Dr. Bewley indicated he probably will be reregistered with 20 mg.
methadone a day as starter. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Male, long criminal record, now under
three-year suspended sentence; long drug history, longest period
off drugs was six weeks; told to come back for urine test. Dr.
Bewley indicated he probably will be put on clinic rolls. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">3. Male, 23, in and out of series of building
industry jobs; said he started with drugs at 16, shooting heroin
and methadone at 20; said now buying six ampoules of methadone a
day on black market at $1.20 per ampoule or $7.20 for day's
supply; no criminal record; first urine test showed methadone;
told to come back after weekend for another urine test. Bewley
estimated there was a 50-50 chance he would not be back. If he
comes and test is positive, he probably will be accepted. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">Dr. Connell, in his study of the previously
cited 107 drug users at a London Clinic, found a large dropout
rate between urine tests. &quot;Refusal to prescribe at first
attendance, whilst awaiting results of urinalysis, led to a high
incidence of failed reattendance. Thus 92 per cent prescribed
heroin reattended, whilst only 35 per cent prescribed no drugs
returned.&quot; This was true, even though 22 out of 36 who had
been given no drugs had positive urine tests.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">This led Dr. Connell to conclude: &quot;In
view of the essential need for accurate diagnosis, it seems
inescapable that a prescribing method of management should not be
adopted until firm evidence of daily use is obtained by, say,
three consecutive positive urines collected on different days and
over a period of ten days or more to take into account the fact
that methadone is excreted more slowly than morphine.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="1">4. Female, 23, no previous history with
clinic; arrested four times, shoplifting, abuse of floor walker;
said she was taking 130 mg. heroin daily obtained from black
market. She was turned down.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">The psychiatrist who first interviewed the
girl acknowledged, as did Dr. Bewley, that much of this
decision-making process is guesswork. Will this girl now go out
and steal enough merchandise to fuel what may be a drug habit?
Will she overshoot herself to convince Lambeth or another clinic
that she really is addicted? No one could answer these questions.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">DRUG DISPENSING</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="1">None of the London addicts receives his drugs
from the medical staff in the clinics. Rather, a prescription is
mailed directly </font><font size="2">to the druggist of the
addict's choice. Only on rare occasions does the addict receive a
prescription personally-for example, if it is clear that the post
office cannot deliver it in time to fill an immediate need.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Each prescription form is filled out by the
clinic physician, generally for a week's supply. Prescription
blanks are kept under lock and key, for there is a black-market
price on blank National Health Service prescription forms.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Although a week's order may be on one
prescription, the addict must collect his supplies from the
druggist daily. On Saturday, he generally receives two days'
supply because of Sunday closing. Black-market prices for drugs,
incidentally, are highest on Sundays, because of weekend demands
by occasional users and addicts who have shot up their two-day
supply on Saturday.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Drugstores are monitored periodically by the
police. However, these reviews generally are confined to the
larger distributors of drugs. The Scotland Yard Drug Squad has
four detectives specifically assigned to inspecting drugstores.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Drugstores keep detailed records of both
incoming and outgoing drugs. I examined this procedure in Boots
Picadilly, the all-night drugstore in London's famed square.
Dangerous drugs are kept in a special locked cabinet. Each
prescription is double checked and, of course, recorded. One
pharmacist will make up the order and initial the package, which
is checked by a second pharmacist. This particular store served
36 addicts daily at the time of this review.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Retail prices are standardized. Heroin is a
bargain compared with the various forms of methadone. The 1970
retail prices were as follows:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Heroin 100 tablets (10 mg. each) 1000 mg.
$2.16</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Methadone 100 ampoules (10 mg. each) 1000 mg.
7.50</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">Methadone linctus (syrup) 5 bottles (200 mg.
each) 1000 mg. 7.80</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Since addicts come under National Health
Service coverage, the drugs are free except for a small-25
cents-weekly service charge. Disposable needles and syringes are
provided directly to addicts by some clinics or are supplied by
the drugstore.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I was able to locate only two clinics in
England that provide drugs administered directly by the staff.
These are in Southampton and Portsmouth. I visited the Portsmouth
clinic, directed by Dr. Ian Christie, in St. James Hospital.
Because of the small number of patients, significant conclusions
cannot be drawn from the in-clinic, drug-administering approach
at this hospital. Seven addicts, six receiving methadone and one
heroin, come to the clinic twice a day for their injections.
These are given by hospital nurses in early-morning and
late-afternoon sessions in the hospital's dental department.
Injections are given in the deltoid muscle. The methadone addicts
I interviewed said that they do not get a &quot;flash&quot; from
the methadone intramuscular injection as they did from heroin
when they administered it intravenously themselves in preclinic
days.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although all addicts mentioned the
inconvenience of coming twice a day to the hospital-which is not
centrally located-only one complained vociferously about it. He
said he had to take a cab from work daily in order not to miss
his second injection, at the 5:15 afternoon clinic. His employer
was unaware of his addiction and, he said, probably would fire
him if he found out.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In addition to the twice-daily clinic
patients, Dr. Christie has four others receiving methadone
linctus which he provides via prescription and two heroin
addicts-a husband and wife with a long history of addiction-who
also receive prescriptions and administer the drug themselves.
&quot;This probably was a mistake,&quot; Christie said.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">None of those receiving any drug is provided
with any rehabilitation services. &quot;if they chose drugs, they
get drugs,&quot; Dr. Christie said.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">He gives each addict alternatives: hospital
in-patient withdrawal (&quot;Everyone who has tried that method
has relapsed&quot;); in-hospital assessment with subsequent
in-clinic daily drug taking; and, finally, entry into a
therapeutic community, called the Alpha Unit.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">PRESCRIPTION TRENDS <br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Since the clinics began operating in 1968, the
quantity of heroin used by English addicts has been greatly
reduced. In the clinics, the monthly total grams of heroin have
dropped from 2,177 in January, 1969, to 1,131 in December, 1970
(see Table 7-4).</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Furthermore, while in 1968 the vast majority
of English addicts were taking heroin, today the majority are
taking methadone alone or in combination with heroin. Whatever
the opiate, the daily amount each addict takes is generally
significantly less than the preclinic daily quantity.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Statistics show that only 10 per cent, or 140,
of all known addicts receiving opiates were receiving heroin
alone on December 31, 1970. However, this may be somewhat
misleading, not only because the reporting procedure may be less
than perfect, but because prescribing physicians frequently
change both the quantity and the kind of drug prescribed.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It is important to remember that methadone in
England most frequently is provided for intravenous injection (as
is heroin), and not for oral consumption, as is common in the
United States. More than twice as much methadone is prescribed
for injection as orally. Most important, injected methadone has a
good &quot;rush&quot; -oral methadone does not.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Most clinics have adopted the policy of moving
from heroin to methadone. Often, this is done gradually by giving
a combination of heroin and methadone for a certain period and
then shifting to methadone only. Finally, an attempt is made to
shift to oral or linctus methadone. Psychiatrists agree that the
hardest task beyond total drug abstention-is to convince the
addict to give up the needle.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This prescribing trend is reflected in the
individual clinics. Here are some samples:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Larnbeth-8 on heroin alone, 12 on methadone
and heroin, 76 on methadone alone</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Clement-36 on methadone and heroin, 35 on
methadone</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">St. Giles-54 on heroin or methadone and
heroin, 1 1 on methadone for injection, 10 on methadone oral</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Charing Cross-2 on heroin, 10 on methadone and
heroin, 45 on methadone for injection, 33 on methadone oral</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Portsmouth-3 on heroin only, 6 on methadone
for injection, 4 on methadone oral</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The shift from heroin to methadone is further
indicated by the fact that clinics today infrequently interview a
new heroin addict. The head nurse of the largest London clinic,
Charing Cross, could not recall the last time a new heroin addict
had been interviewed; all the new cases were methadone addicts.
In Portsmouth, Dr. Christie said, no one addicted to heroin had
applied for help in the previous year; all the newcomers were
methadone addicts.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">METHADONE MAINTENANCE <br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Directors of government clinics do not
practice the Dole Nyswander methadone-maintenance technique,
emphasizing blocking the effect of heroin. Significantly, four
clinic directors expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the
blocking method. Dr. Christie, for example, believes that
methadone blocks heroin in American addicts because they are
accustomed to receive low and diluted doses of the latter drug.
&quot;When an addict takes only four or five $5 bags a day, which
don't contain more than 20 milligrams of heroin, then it
works.&quot; The others agreed that an addict who takes large
doses of heroin daily cannot be blocked with methadone.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, a private London clinic, run by Dr.
Peter A. L. Chapple, has experimented with the
methadone-maintenance approach known in the United States. This
is the National Addiction and Research Institute, which has at
least as many active patients as the biggest government clinic.
Dr. Chapple prescribes only oral methadone. He is not licensed to
prescribe heroin in his clinic, and he is opposed to prescribing
methadone for injection because it perpetuates the needle cult.
In 1969, he prescribed oral methadone to 106 patients, 70 per
cent of whom were receiving blocking dosages (between 100 and 200
milligrams a day). There are no scientific data available
indicating whether these addicts actually were blocked from the
effect of heroin. Recently, however, Dr. Chapple said that he has
been trying to</font><font size="1"> reduce the dosages of oral
methadone. &quot;It probably was a mistake to go as high as 200
milligrams a day,&quot; he added. The maximum is now 100
milligrams a day, while younger addicts are more likely to be
around the 30-milligram-per-day level. Dr. Chapple said he has
shifted from giving a blocking dose because there is less heroin
around. He said he wanted to satisfy the drug hunger and not
necessarily to block heroin.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">*Interclinic statistics kept only since
September, 1969. <b>SOURCE: </b>Department of Health and Social
Security.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="1">He acknowledged that it is very difficult to
work with younger </font><font size="2">addicts using oral
methadone, largely because of their delinquent and erratic
behavior. Last year, a young addict died as a result of taking
barbiturates while also taking oral methadone. (Dr. Connell, in
his examination of 107 addicts at a government clinic, also
recorded an oral-methadone overdose death. This involved an
addict on 100 milligrams a day who obtained the next day's supply
shortly after midnight and drank both within hours of each
other.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If England's drug doctors do not subscribe to
methadone maintenance, why have they shifted so dramatically to
methadone from heroin?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">First, the very creation of the clinic
approach was prompted by what England viewed <i>as </i>a growing
heroin epidemic. There was public and political pressure to halt
the rise in heroin addicts. The monthly distribution of a dossier
showing the amounts of heroin prescribed by each clinic made it
clear to each clinic director where he stood among his peers in
this respect and undoubtedly created pressure to bring the
quantity down.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Secondly, there is general agreement among
clinic physicians that methadone has a longer-lasting effect than
heroin. Thus, the addict needs fewer injections a day.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Thirdly, methadone for injection is considered
somewhat more sterile than heroin, since it comes in liqui4 form,
so that the addict merely transfers the ampoule content directly
into his syringe. With heroin, he mixes a 10-milligram pill with
water, usually unsterile and sometimes from a tap or even a
toilet bowl, to dissolve the pill before injecting.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Finally, methadone for injection is viewed by
a number of doctors as the bridge to oral methadone. Breaking the
needle cult is considered an important success step in the
drug-treatment program in England.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Unfortunately, addict performances on heroin,
methadone for injection, and oral methadone have received no
detailed scientific comparison in England.
Furthermore-surprisingly, to an outsider-methadone continues to
be available outside of the drug clinics. There is nothing to
prevent general practitioners from prescribing it. A few, in
fact, do. (Scotland Yard Drug Squad detectives, who monitor
drugstores, say that about six London doctors prescribe methadone
on a regular basis.) Ironically, the second Brain Committee
foresaw the possibility that a substitute drug might become
potentially as dangerous as heroin. When the committee urged and
achieved prescribing restrictions on heroin, it said: &quot;If,
in future, circumstances should change, and other drugs of
addiction should take the place now occupied by heroin and
cocaine, it would be necessary promptly to amend the 'restricted'
list accordingly.&quot; A number of leading professionals have
urged that methadone be placed on the &quot;restricted&quot;
list, but this has not been done.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinic shift from heroin to methadone,
plus the absence of prescribing prohibitions on general
practitioners, undoubtedly had led to a new metbadone-addiction
problem. The key issue is how big a problem it is. The over-all
clinic drug-dispensing statistics indicate strongly that
considerably lower quantities of combined heroin and methadone
are being prescribed today than the largely heroin-only
prescriptions at the beginning of the clinic era, but exactly how
much lower is impossible to show, since methadone statistics were
not reported until September, 1969.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, it appears that there has not been a
simple switch from a heroin to a methadone problem. Doctors
interviewed are concerned about rising methadone cases but do not
suggest that they are replacing heroin cases on a one-for-one
basis. That is, the methadone increase is moving at a
considerably slower pace than the sharp drop in heroin addiction,
although no one can document the relative rates of change.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The police, however, are less inclined to make
distinctions. In a 1970 report, Scotland Yard said:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There has been a transference of addiction in as much as
    the treatment centers have succeeded in reducing the amount
    of heroin prescribed to addicts, thereby reducing the
    availability of this drug on the &quot;illicit market.&quot;
    But, in so doing, they have increased the prescribing of
    methadone to counterbalance this reduction; consequently,
    there is now far more methadone available on the
    &quot;illicit market.&quot; <br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p> <center><font size="1">DRUGS OUTSIDE THE CLINICS<br>
</font></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">How many other drugs do addicts take to
supplement those prescribed by the clinics?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">While evidence in this area is both
fragmentary and sometimes disputed, there is agreement that
English addicts often supplement the clinic-prescribed drug diet,
with a wide assortment of chemicals that affect both the mind and
the body. These include black-market methadone or heroin,
amphetamines, barbiturates, tranquilizers, and marijuana, or, for
that matter, a smattering of all of them. In short, the addict in
England more often than not is a polydrug taker.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The most significant evidence comes from a
wide-ranging study conducted by two staff members of the
Addiction Research Institute. Between March and November, 1969,
they interviewed in depth I I I heroin users attending the London
clinics, representing about 10 per cent of all clinic patients in
England.' The results showed that only a small proportion of
English addicts can be considered &quot;stable&quot; in their
drug-taking habits.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Several clinic directors expressed
reservations about the study, claiming that it did not represent
a true cross-section of their population since it included only
active heroin addicts. At the time of the interviews, they said,
many of their patients, particularly the more promising ones, had
already been weaned off heroin and onto methadone only. The
study, however, did include 91 (of the 111) who were receiving
heroin in combination with methadone.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Eighty-four per cent reported to interviewers
that in the month prior to the interview they had used drugs
other than those prescribed for them by the clinics. Among these
other drugs, the largest number reported using barbiturates and
tranquilizers (75 per cent), which, in the majority of cases,
were prescribed by private physicians. This is an important
indication that extracurricular drug taking did not necessarily
mean adding larger doses of illegally obtained narcotics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The range of drugs used is demonstrated in
Table 7-5. These statistics show that the one additional drug all
1 1 1 heroin addicts had used was marijuana or hashish <i>(cannabis).</i></font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">An interesting sidelight brought out during
the interviews was that 37 per cent had on occasion sold, lent,
or exchanged at least some of the drugs the clinics prescribed
for them. In addition, the study confirmed the worst fears of
physicians about the </font><font size="1">unsterile procedures
that are an important risk when addicts administer drugs to
themselves. The report speaks best for itself: </font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>All subjects were using heroin by injection. In the week
    prior to interview 28 (25%) subjects had injected themselves
    at home only, a further 17 (15%) had injected themselves at
    their clinic or at a day center as well as at their home, 46
    (41 %) had injected themselves at some time during the week
    in a public toilet as well as at home, clinic, or day center,
    and 20 (18%) had injected themselves in a &quot;public
    place&quot;-e.g., shop doorways, in the street ' or in
    telephone kiosks-in addition to any of the above places.
    Sixty-two (56%) had injected themselves whilst other addicts
    were present and also injecting themselves. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The majority of subjects ( 101, 91 %) used a disposable
    syringe for their injections and of these 67 (66%) regularly
    used their syringes more than once. Seventy-two subjects
    (68%) did not clean their arms prior to injection. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Although the most frequent method for preparing an
    injection was to dissolve heroin in sterile water, 54 (49%)
    had at some time during the week used ordinary unboiled tap
    water, and 12 (11%) had used water from a lavatory basin.
    Nine subjects reported sharing a syringe with another addict
    during the week.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <img src="img00031.gif"> </p>

<p> <font size="1">If injection practices are defined as sterile
when normal medical </font><font size="2">procedure is followed
(i.e., using a new disposable syringe for each injection or using
an adequately sterilized glass syringe, not sharing a syringe,
cleaning the arm prior to injection, and making up the injection
with sterile water) then in the total sample, 12 subjects (11%)
are using sterile injection practices. In the week prior to
interview all others had engaged in some non-sterile practice. </font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">This kind of unsterile drug taking often led
to medical complications. Thirty-nine per cent had been in
hospitals for treatment of septicaernia, hepatitis, abscesses, or
overdose. Of all addicts interviewed, 40 per cent reported
hepatitis and overdose and 46 per cent reported abscesses treated
both in and outside of hospitals.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although this report indicated no particular
trend in polydrug taking, since the clinics began doctors have
seen definite increases in two drugs: methylamphetamine (speed)
and barbiturates. In 1968, methylamphetamine was injected by
addicts with such frequency that authorities asked its
manufacturers to agree to withdraw it from the retail market and
restrict its distribution to hospital pharmacies. Within weeks of
its disappearance from retail drugstores it disappeared among the
addict population.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Misuse of barbiturates. by addicts became an
acute problem in 1969. Some physicians, however, feel that it has
slowed somewhat since the last part of 1970. Addicts inject
barbiturates even though they are not manufactured, so that they
will dissolve completely in water. The undissolved particles
result in collapsed veins and serious abscesses on addicts' arms
and legs. Addicts I've interviewed said that they resorted to
barbiturates when they couldn't get enough heroin or methadone
from the clinics. This, like all addict testimonials, is open to
question.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The degree of barbiturate abuse-particularly
by injection-is another aspect of the English drug scene that is
left largely to conjecture. A study in 1969 of a small sample of
heroin addicts -again conducted by a team from the Addiction
Research Unit-showed that among this sample the problem was
huge.' Sixty-five heroin addicts were interviewed in May, June,
and July of 1969, and 80 per cent were found to have injected
barbiturates. Almost all of them-62 of the 65-had taken
barbiturates either by injection or orally. Of course, some had
used the drug only to help induce sleep. However, 65 per cent
acknowledged they had taken it for no medical reason and only for
&quot;kicks.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A few addicts will take barbiturates with them
to the clinics, although they may have obtained them from a
general practitioner or bought them illicitly. I observed an
especially bizarre scene in one of the clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There were two chairs in the room, a steel
sink, a length of rubber hose to use as a tourniquet, some
cotton, and a supply of paper towels. The walls and the chairs
were stained with dried blood; in general, the physical
appearance of the room was far from the kind of antiseptic clinic
presented by the likes of Drs. Kildare and Ben Casey. The
characters on this stage were two young addicts, both unsteady on
their feet from drugs taken earlier. One took a syringe from his
pocket, washed it out with tap water from the sink, pulled a
folded piece of paper from another pocket, removed a barbiturate
capsule, broke it in half over the syringe, and emptied its
contents into the tube.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Once the white powder was in the syringe, he
added tap water, shook the contents vigorously for several
seconds, and handed the syringe to his friend. Since his arms and
ankles were marked with sores, however, it took several minutes
to locate a usable vein. Finally, he settled on a spot about
eight inches below the knee. (The other addict, incidentally,
shortly afterwards injected himself in the sole of his foot.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">A third addict, more stable, helped the first
boy out of the clinic by steadying him with an arm around his
shoulders. But once outside the clinic, the boy sagged and
collapsed on the grass. A few addicts nearby helped to drag the
boy out of the sun to a tree, where they sat him up against its
trunk.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">I was not alone in observing this sequence; a
clinic psychiatrist watched the entire scene with me. No effort
was made to assist, dissuade, or reprimand the addicts. We were
both spectators, like a couple of medical students watching
surgical techniques from behind a glass partition. <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">LAW ENFORCEMENT <br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although the English have consistently viewed
drug addiction as a medical problem, this does not mean that the
police have been dismissed from the drug scene. Possession,
selling, and importing most dangerous drugs are against the law.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">An addict can go to a government clinic and,
after convincing doctors of his addiction, obtain free heroin,
but this does not mean that anyone can walk around London with a
pocketful of &quot;horse&quot; or any other opiate. Possession of
heroin, methadone, and similar dangerous drugs is illegal without
a prescription. In the case of heroin, the only source of such a
prescription is a government clinic.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Marijuana and hashish are illegal, period.
There are no prescriptions given for these drugs and no medical
&quot;cover&quot; exists to protect the owner of them. In
England, they are clearly the number-one illegal drug, and their
use continues to rise along with the arrest statistics of those
who are caught with them. From 1968 to 1970, the number of <i>cannabis
</i>offenses more than doubled from 3,071 to 7,520. In 1970, <i>cannibis
</i>seizures amounted to </font><font size="1">11/4 </font><font
size="2">tons.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Unlike the United States, Britain has no
national police agency for drugs. For that matter, if there is no
equivalent to the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs,
neither is there one for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Scotland Yard is essentially a London agency, and, when a
Scotland Yard man is found looking for clues on some fog-shrouded
English moor (usually in a paperback detective thriller), he is
there on loan from London. In short, there is no national police
force.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Drug squads have been created largely because
of need or, sometimes, because of the personal interest of an
individual police officer. These squads have no nationwide
resources available to them either from an enforcement or from a
training point of view. Drug-squad members, including the
higher-echelon officers in charge of them, are largely
self-educated about drugs. Even Scotland Yard's Drug Squad is
likely to have a director today who next month or next year may
be shifted to a completely different area of police work.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">However, this does not mean that expertise has
not built up. There is no better example of expertise constructed
largely out of self-developed personal interest than Detective
Sergeant Alan Russell, who heads the drug squad in Portsmouth. If
a national police drug force ever should be established, as some
are urging, Sergeant Russell should have a prominent role in it
on the basis of his record in Portsmouth.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Russell has an excellent, and unpublicized,
working relationship with Dr. Christie of the Portsmouth drug
clinic: Christie doesn't squeal on addicts and Russell doesn't
give away police plans, but it is clear from the way the two men
speak of each other that each has developed a warm respect for
the other's approach to addiction. The addicts appear to respect
Russell as well. When the residents of Alpha Unit, the
therapeutic community directed by Dr. Christie, decided to hold
an open house, they invited Russell even though he had arrested a
number of them on past occasions.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Because of the Christie-Russell liaison-and
addicts corroborate it-there is virtually no black market in
heroin or methadone in the Portsmouth area. In 1969, Russell's
squad arrested two persons for possessing heroin, and this
involved only minute traces found in a syringe. During the entire
year, there were 12 to 15 methadone-possession arrests.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Russell, however, regards opiate addiction as
only a small part of his concern. &quot;Dependence on opiate
drugs is only the tip of the iceberg,&quot; he says. &quot;You
have millions of people in this country who are dependent on
barbiturates and amphetamines.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the greater Portsmouth area, with a
population of about 500,000, he estimates that there are as many
as 1,500 users of marijuana, barbiturates, and amphetamines, some
of whom may dabble with all of these drugs. This estimate is in
marked contrast to the very low numbers of hard-drug addicts-14
in the clinic and 17 in the Alpha Unit therapeutic community.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Possibly in part because of his respect for
Dr. Christie, Portsmouth's chief drug police officer has a very
positive attitude toward the clinics. &quot;Make no mistake about
it-and some people tend to forget it-a few years ago this country
had a serious heroin problem.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In London, there is considerable criticism of
the clinics among members of Scotland Yard's Drug Squad, although
not a single police officer whom I interviewed was willing to
scrap the clinics. Several officers thought that some clinic
doctors were still being conned by addicts into issuing larger
prescriptions than required. However, all the officers agreed
that overprescribing had been reduced drastically since preclinic
days.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">As an example that the problem has not been
eliminated entirely, they cite a case in 1969: A member of the
squad searched the apartment of a longtime addict who had been
receiving drugs from one of the central London clinics before his
death. The search uncovered a horde of heroin-900 tablets or
9,000 milligrams, worth more than $2,100 on the British black
market and easily three times as much on the U.S. market.
Although there was no evidence that the addict had been selling
from this cache, the police felt strongly that it corroborated
their overprescribing charge.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Furthermore, police are annoyed that there is
no limit on the amount an addict with a clinic prescription may
carry. Recently, they stopped an addict with 40 grains (2,400
milligrams) of heroin. He told officers he had been reducing his
prescribed quantity, and no arrest was possible, even though the
police strongly doubted his story.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Yet, such dramatic anecdotes are the
exception. A review of squad arrest records shows that, from the
beginning of June to September 7, 1970 (the date of the
interview), there hadn't been a single heroin arrest and only two
methadone-possession arrests. (These were not the only London
drug arrests; for, although the squad is the only police unit
concerned solely with drugs, other London policemen make drug
arrests in the course of their regular activities.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Some members of the drug squad frankly admit
that they would be in trouble if heroin were completely outlawed.
None is campaigning for such a move. One top drug-squad officer,
a critic of the present clinic approach (&quot;They sustain
addiction . . . there is no place in England where a drug addict
can be cured&quot;) is not interested in abolishing them, either.
He would like to see all drugs administered by the clinics in the
clinics. Instead of fourteen separate clinics in London, he would
like four open on a twenty-four-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week
basis.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Scotland Yard detectives acknowledge that the
clinics have reduced not only the quantity of heroin prescribed
but the amount available on the black market. Cocaine, they say,
has also been reduced dramatically. Like their colleagues in
Portsmouth, however, they are often more concerned about the
other drugs that are available on the black market.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The lead drug, of course, is marijuana. They
claim that large scale trafficking is mainly carried on by
England's new immigrant population, primarily the Pakistanis.
Marijuana comes into England frequently by parcel post directly
from the producing countries. Students also bring it in from such
well-known drug centers as Morocco.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">LSD most often comes from the United States,
even though in<b> </b>1969 English police raided and closed down
at least two illicit laboratories producing LSD for both local
consumption and export.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There appears to be little organized
importation of heroin. What there is generally comes from Hong
Kong and is imported by Chinese sailors and distributed by
inhabitants of the small Chinese community in London. Addicts
generally are not fond of Chinese heroin because of its uncertain
strength and, since it comes in powder form, the necessity to
heat it in a spoon-in the U.S. mode-before mixing it for
injection.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Police acknowledge that one can buy a variety
of illicit drugs in the network of side streets in and around
Picadilly Circus and in some other areas of London where youth
congregate, often in or around the late-night clubs. However,
these illicit business enterprises are small and unorganized,
particularly in the hard drug line.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Black-market prices in 1970, according to the
addicts and confirmed by clinic physicians and police, are as
follows: </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin (British-manufactured) $14.40 a grain
(60 mg.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Heroin (Chinese) $3.60 a packet (30-60 mg.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Methadone $7.20-$12.80 a grain (60 mg.)</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Barbiturates 25 cents a capsule <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There is no evidence anywhere that large
numbers of hard-drug users are supplying themselves from this
black market. Furthermore, there is no evidence at all that
heroin manufactured in France-the principal source of supply for
U.S. addicts-is being smuggled into England. The market just
isn't big enough to make such an enterprise profitable.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Scotland Yard does keep track of international
and particularly European illicit-drug activity. Its principal
source for this information is not Interpol but the European
office of the U.S. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. The
drug-squad detectives express a great deal of respect for their
American colleagues and are quick to admit that, if they need
information or have a common problem, they will call Paris rather
than Interpol. Often, they say, an American narcotics agent will
arrive on the next plane.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1970, the BNDD for the first time assigned
a permanent man to the embassy in London, as part of its over-all
European expansion of manpower. A London slot was created because
of the LSD traffic from the United States to England and the
marijuana and hashish flow from England to the United States.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">John T. Cusack, the BNDD's European regional
director, is not enthusiastic about the English clinic approach.
Of all police officers interviewed, he was the most strongly
negative about the clinic program. &quot;The<b> </b>clinics are
not going to work giving away heroin. They are going to sustain
and create some addicts,&quot; he said.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">He had three principal objections: &quot; [I]
It fools society. It kids all of us that it's<b> </b>doing a job
when it isn't doing a job. [21 The addicts will take what they
can get from the clinics and then they will get some more from
the outside. [31 The clinics flirt with a conflict of the
Hypocratic oath of the medical profession. They sustain a
medical-psychiatric sickness.&quot; (This argument is also made
by some British physicians, like Dr. Ian James, a British prison
psychiatrist.)</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Cusack, however, is not a
throw-them-all-in-jail police officer. He wants medical treatment
for addicts and believes that governments don't<b> </b>spend
anywhere near what they should on hospital care for addicts.
&quot;I feel so strongly about it that I'd like to sweep up all
the addicts off the New York streets and put them into hospitals.
It's incredible to me to leave addicts on the street. It's<b> </b>a
big, expensive job to bring them in, but we don't let our mental
patients run loose, do we?&quot; <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">If Cusack strongly disagrees with the English
clinic philosophy, his London police colleagues sharply differ
with their American counterparts over one vital aspect of the
drug problem: the connection between crime and addiction. <i>No
one in England-from the toughest London detective to the most
liberal-prescribing clinic physician-suggested to me that
narcotics addiction increases criminal behavior. </i>This does
not mean, of course, that drug addicts are crime-free. On the
contrary, a significant number of addicts engage in criminal
behavior, and some criminals are addicts. But in England there is
no cause-and-effect relationship.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Scotland Yard says it in writing. In a 1970
report, its drug expert wrote: &quot;There is no concrete
evidence to connect any particular criminal activity with those
dependent on the 'hard' drugs (e.g., heroin) but without doubt,
the increasing demand for the amphetamine-type drugs leads to
thefts from chemists' premises, hospitals, and, in a smaller
degree, to thefts of prescription forms.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Study after study documents the fact that
sticking a needle into his arm doesn't propel a man into the
robber and burglar fraternity. More likely, he will have been
initiated long before. What these studies do show is that addicts
often have a whole series of antisocial &quot;hang-ups,&quot; of
which addiction is just one more on the lengthy list.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the previously cited 1970 study of 111
heroin addicts attending London clinics, 51 per cent reported a
conviction for a nondrug offense <i>before </i>their first use of
heroin. Thirty-six per cent reported such a conviction since
using heroin.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A 1967 study of 50 addict-criminals in London
prisons again indicates that a track record in court and prison
often is established before track marks on the subject's arms.'
Brixton Prison psychiatrist Ian James found that 22 addicts had a
history of juvenile-court conviction and 16 had adult-court
convictions prior to heroin addiction. In all, &quot;Three
quarters had a history of court convictions <i>predating </i>their
addiction to narcotics, and there was usually a story of personal
and social maladjustment dating from adolescence (educational
dropout, employment instability, sociopathic conduct,
etc.).&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Ten of the subjects had been convicted only
since they became addicted, but only two were in prison for their
very first conviction. Dr. James found, too, that, if one
discounts drug convictions, fewer convictions for crimes were
recorded <i>after </i>addiction than before.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Although it is risky to draw conclusions about
United States addicts based on English findings, one young
American doctor did suggest that what was true about preaddiction
delinquency in Britain may be even more valid in the United
States. Dr. Michael Paris, formerly on the staff of the Federal
Hospital for Addict Rehabilitation at Lexington, Kentucky, worked
with Dr. Bewley in 1970 in his London clinics. Asked to compare
U.S. and British addicts, he said that the Americans he saw at
Lexington had bad at least twice as much antisocial behavior in
their early teens as the London addicts.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In the first study of heroin users in a
provincial town, investigators found a reduction rather than an
increase in crime after addiction began. Twenty of 37 heroin
users had been convicted of breaking the law.&quot; </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The crimes not involving drugs were generally
petty in nature, such as stealing two pints of milk, minor
shopliftng, and taking and driving away a motor vehicle. Of the
ten people who had been convicted of nondrug offenses, three had
committed them before using any drugs at all, and seven between
first trying drugs and first trying heroin. There was only one
person who was convicted of a nondrug offense after heroin use
began, and this person had already been convicted of such a crime
before the onset of heroin use. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">These findings prompted investigators to
suggest further research:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Many of our subjects were in full-time
employment or were full-time students; most were still living at
home with their parents, a high proportion of whom knew of their
heroin use. Although there were instances of nondrug crime before
heroin use began, there was only one such conviction (a second
offense) afterwards. Whether drug use is for some people an
&quot;alternative&quot; to other types of delinquent behavior is
a question which suggests itself for investigation and remains
open, but it is clear that our sample in no way constitutes a
drifting criminal subculture, <br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">RESEARCH<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Until 1967, research in drug addiction in
England depended on the personal interest of a physician. A
handful of doctors wrote papers based on their personal
experiences with addicts. Public awareness of the problem still
was slight, and concern and knowledge among doctors in general
were not much greater. Funds for research simply were not
available.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Today, the veterans of the predrug-crisis era
continue to produce papers for both national and international
medical publications, but they have been joined not only by
individual newcomers but by a government-supported research
project as well.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The Addiction Research Unit is a kind of
scientific conglomerate that investigates three of man's<b> </b>major
vices-drinking, smoking, and drug addiction. The unit, a part of
the Department of Psychiatry of London University's Institute of
Psychiatry, began in 1964 as an alcoholism research group. In
1967, after the Brain Committee report was translated into
legislation and public concern heightened with the catapulting
addiction statistics, political pressure prompted the Health
Department to provide funds for drug-addiction research. Drug
investigations were added to the unit's agenda, and sufficient
funds were supplied to construct a separate building on the
grounds of Maudsley Hospital. Research on smoking was added in
1969.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Each area of investigation has a separate
staff and coordinator, with the largest number in the
drug-addiction field. Dr. Griffith Edwards, whose earlier
interest was in alcoholism, is director of the entire unit, and
Dr. David V. Hawks, a psychologist, is coordinator of the
eleven-man (and woman) Drug Research Group.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Another organization, the Institute for the
Study of Drug Dependence, a privately financed group, does no
clinical research, although it is looking for funds to finance
both clinical and other investigations. The Institute, with Sir
Harry Greenfield as board chairman, is directed by a retired
foreign-service officer with a personal interest in addiction. In
the two years since it began, this struggling enterprise-financed
by small foundation grants-has carved out a useful function as an
information clearinghouse. It is the one place in England where a
researcher can find extensive, indexed, and easily available
material on the English drug scene as well as numerous items
involving other countries.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Until now, the national Department of Health
has done no specific drug-addiction research of its own. In 1970,
a joint committee of the Health Department and the Home Office
was created primarily to try to straighten out the sometimes
confused drug statistics. It recommended establishment of a Drugs
Research Group to be staffed by both agencies. While no specific
research program was proposed, the committee suggested the
following areas of investigation:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1. Developing a typology of heroin users.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Measuring the effectiveness of different
forms of treatment in the existing clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">3. Comparing the effectiveness of compulsory
treatment (in prison) with voluntary treatment in hospitals.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">More important, perhaps, was the committee's
recommendation that statistical information be compiled on all
persons addicted to <i>any </i>dangerous drug in England and
Wales. The Department of Health is now building such a data bank,
which already includes a total of 2,400 names, with the basic
information obtained when an addict applies to a clinic or is
hospitalized. Other government statistical records to be tapped
include:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">1. Dates and causes of death from the General
Register office.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">2. Admissions and length of stay in
psychiatric hospitals from the Department of Health and Social
Security records. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">3. Details of employment histories, sickness
and unemployment payments from the Department of Health and
Social Security's Mental Health Inquiry Records.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">4. Criminal records and prison statistics from
the Home Office Statistical Division.<br>
</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This will be a vital resource for
investigators and will open numerous research opportunities into
drug addiction in England.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">THE STATISTICS <br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">How accurate are the drug statistics in
England today?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">It is difficult to generalize. Some statistics
are clearly more solid than others. A number of persons
interviewed expressed skepticism about the validity of one or
more sets of statistics. Included among the skeptics was a
Department of Health official who works with the drug numbers.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The problem with the statistics is that
reporting depends on individual physicians and clinic personnel
whose information is not channeled through a system of
cross-checks. The new Health Department data bank should help to
improve the accuracy of some of these statistics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Among the numerical data available, the clinic
figures reporting quantities of drugs prescribed appear to be
least open to significant error. Apart from an occasional
bookkeeping mistake, these statistics should accurately reflect
the downward trend of heroin use and the rise in methadone.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The monthly clinic-attendance figures should
stand up. However, the number of new addicts that clinics report
every month may be a somewhat soft statistical area, because
clinics may vary in their definition of a new addict.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The clinic figures for the percentage of
addicts employed could be on the high side, since
&quot;employment&quot; depends on the individual's definition,
and the accuracy of the addict's statements is questionable. The
data bank, which will include employment records based on
social-security information, should provide a cross-check for
these claims.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The vital Home Office figures on addicts have
to be separated into addicts reported any time during the year
and addicts known to be receiving drugs at the end of the year.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The figures for the total year tend to be
accepted as reasonably correct by those interviewed, with the
general acknowledgment that obviously not every addict in England
is known to the Home Office. However, no one suggested that the
number of &quot;unknowns&quot; is as large as the numbers listed.
Opiate addiction, under the English drug approach, is difficult
to conceal if it is taking place on any significant scale. The
highest estimate for unreported opiate use was 25 per cent, but
this guesstimate included occasional users as well as addicts.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">The Home Office figures for 1968 may be
unusually high because inauguration of the clinics may well have
flushed out previously unknown addicts. As a result, the tiny
increase in the total 1969 figures may not accurately reflect the
degree of change. Not until the end of 1970 did England have a
firm statistical basis for concluding that the narcotic-addiction
spiral of the 1960's had been halted.<br>
</font> </p>

<hr>

<p> <center><i><font size="2">RESULTS<br>
</font></i></center> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There is a shortage of hard statistical data
about the success or failure of Britain's drug approach, either
before or after the clinic program was begun. Most available
evaluations were done prior to the inauguration of the clinic
program. These do not generate applause.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">For example, in 1968, a study of 1,271 heroin
addicts who became known to the Home Office between 1947 and 1966
showed that 70 per cent were still taking opiates in 1966.&quot;
Of the nontakers, some 293 addicts-64 per cent-were in prison,
hospital, or other institutions, and 89 were dead, the majority
as a result of overdose, suicide, or sepsis.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The death rate among English addicts has been
very high according to the Bewley study, twice as high as among
U.S. addicts. However, this study was conducted prior to the
clinic program, when British addicts were receiving huge amounts
of heroin prescribed by general practitioners. The death rate
among addicts included in this review was 28 times greater than
the rate for the equivalent age group in the general population.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Studies of withdrawal treatment in hospitals
are not more encouraging. In one follow-up of 23 hospital
admissions, 12 relapsed within a week, five within a month, and
three within two months. Only three were still avoiding narcotics
three months after discharge.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Like their American brethren, the English
today have no file folder marked &quot;cures&quot;; there is no
computer printout on clinic performance that supports either the
critics or the defenders of the program.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There is, however, a cautious thread of
optimism that runs through conversations with clinic directors
and also a surprising degree of candor in identifying areas of
shortcoming and outright failure. Furthermore, these subjective
evaluations by different directors generally make nearly
identical points of both promise and disappointment. Finally,
they are echoed by those who have no particular vested interest
in the clinics.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Margaret Tripp, a doctor at St. Clement
with no previous experience with drug addicts, frankly admits
that her charges conned her in the beginning. Two years later she
said: <b>&quot;I </b>think we are controlling legal heroin. Much
to my surprise, we have stabilized the addicts-they're not dead,
and they are better. They are more stable than before; their drug
use has gone down, they work longer, and they are less of a
nuisance to everybody.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Tripp chooses her words very carefully:
&quot;Three or four of the [present] cases are reasonably off
drugs.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Willis, at St. Giles, also avoids words
like &quot;success&quot; and &quot;cure.&quot; He also cites the
drop in heroin and agrees that the rise of addiction has slowed.
&quot;It's been possible to mount a general tidying-up operation.
They are more stable now than they were a year ago. Their general
appearance is better. They are not asking for more drugs, and
they are not claiming as much drug loss [in order to obtain
replacements] as they did before.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. Connell, who is among the handful of
English drug-treatment veterans, a consultant to the national
Health Department and director of the Maudsley Hospital drug
clinic, summed it up this way:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm pleased that the frightening curve of heroin addiction
    has leveled off. I'm disturbed that methadone and
    barbiturates have risen. In terms of containing the heroin
    problem, they [the clinics] are successful. They have
    provided some treatment services where none have existed. All
    of the terrible prognostications of American workers in the
    drug field have been unfounded. But [Dr. Connell added] in
    terms of research they are a failure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">Similar sentiments are voiced by those who are
being asked to evaluate their own work. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Even the most hardened policeman-as we noted
in the law enforcement section-is not prepared to suggest that
England should scrap the clinics. Despite the grumbling about
doctors who are either too softhearted-in the eyes of the
police-or simply conned by addicts, the interviewer is left with
the distinct impression that even law-enforcement officers
believe that the hard-drug picture has improved somewhat.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Among druggists, there also is cautious
optimism for the clinic approach. For example, Jerry Young, chief
chemist at Boots Picadilly, says flatly:</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I'm very pleased with the clinic system. I'd even be more
    pleased if they'd take the whole thing in their hands
    [administer drugs directly in the clinics]. We see more
    stability in the addicts. They don't come in making
    exorbitant demands on our service and our time. The genuine
    addicts are less of a nuisance. On the whole, they took
    physically better. They respond better.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">Asked for some tangible proof of his
assessment, Mr. Young said that, prior to the spring of 1968,
when the clinics began, he had to call the police on the average
of twice a week to control an unruly addict in his pharmacy. Now,
he said, he can't remember a recent call for police assistance
with a clinic addict. Occasionally, he asks police help with a
forged prescription or when someone under the influence of
barbiturates makes a disturbance.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Mr. Young's analysis, like those of the
physicians who send him prescriptions, is subjective. However,
there are at least a few statistical indications-developed since
the clinic program began -that tend to support these assumptions.
To find them, you have to go to an institution dealing with a
considerably larger clientele than drug addicts.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Brixton Prison, with its incongruous
flower-filled inner courtyard, is to London what the Tombs is to
New York. It is a remand prison, where all London-area male
prisoners are brought while awaiting trial. There are 12,000
&quot;receptions&quot; there annually.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Brixton, in 1970, had on its staff the one man
who may have seen more English drug addicts personally than any
other individual. Dr. Ian James, the prison psychiatrist, has a
long interest in drug addiction. His small prison office is lined
with maps showing the routes by which drugs come to England, the
location of addict arrests in London, the location of clinics,
the arrests of those who are off drugs-all appropriately marked
in clusters of multicolored pins.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1969, Dr. James saw 223 drug addicts who
were at Brixton for both drug and other offenses. They
represented about 10 per cent of all heroin addicts reported to
the Home Office during the year. Significantly, Dr. James said it
was rarely that he saw an addict unknown to the Home Office.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. James in the past has been a vocal
opponent of the clinic program. His opposition was based largely
on medical ethics.</font> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Nobody prescribes two bottles of gin a day with duly
    enriched Vitamin B for alcoholics. The doctor knows that the
    addict will use an unsanitary procedure to satisfy his
    habits. He will take unsterile pills [heroin tablets], hold
    them in his sweaty hand, and put them in a syringe which he
    pulls from his grimy pocket. What kind of medicine is that? </p>
</blockquote>

<p> <font size="2">But Dr. James's own statistics are softening
his anticlinic stand to the point where he said: &quot;I think
the clinics are succeeding, but on the wrong premises.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">Dr. James's accounting may not give
overwhelming proof to the statement that the clinics are having a
positive impact, but it does add some significant bone behind the
subjective flesh of cautious optimism.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">In 1970, a third fewer drug addicts were
admitted to Brixton than during the previous year, Almost
three-fourths of all addicts received at Brixton in 1970 were
attending a drug-addiction clinic prior to their arrest. In 1968,
only three-fifths of the drug addicts were clinic-registered.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">These statistics not only buttress the
cautious optimism of English drug experts but also cast doubt on
any contention that there is a large addict population unknown to
the Home Office or to the clinics. If such an &quot;unknown&quot;
addict pool in fact existed, sustaining itself from the
high-priced black market, a significant number of its members
surely would appear periodically inside the steel gates of
Brixton. </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">There are other substantive indications that
the narcotics situation is improving. At three London centers,
the number of addicts holding jobs almost doubled in two years.
In these same clinics, a series of urine tests given a year apart
showed that, while many addicts still were taking more and
different drugs than those prescribed, such misuse had been
reduced.&quot; In yet another survey, there were fewer arrests a
year after addicts had been with a clinic than before.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">But what does all this mean for the United
States? What relevance does it have to America's ever-increasing
narcotics problem? In the past, almost all visiting American drug
experts have said flatly: None.&quot; The two countries, they
said, are just too different. Not only do some key narcotics laws
point in opposite directions, but the two societies' traditions,
youth culture, and race problems are so disparate that what works
in the row houses of London could not possibly work in the
walk-ups of New York.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">A young researcher at the Addiction Research
Unit may well have given an explosive jolt to such blanket
dismissals. Jim Zacune, a social psychologist, in 1970 examined
in detail the performance of Canadian addicts in their native
land and after they emigrated to England. His study is
significant to the U.S.-Britain narcotics-policy argument, since
Canada's approach to opiate addiction is largely patterned after
ours.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Zacune traced and interviewed 25 of the 91
Canadian addicts who are known to have come to England in the
1960's. The rest of the emigres could not be located or had
either died or been deported. For those he was able to interview,
Zacune compared work records, prison records, and crime records
in the two countries. He diplomatically says that his findings
should not be used to condemn one country's addiction approach
while praising another's, and cautions that his sample may have
included the most stable of the Canadians who packed up their
syringes for England. But his findings are nevertheless
startling: </font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At home, the Canadians spent 25 per cent of
their addicted years, a combined total of 141 years and 2 months,
in jail; in England, less than 2 per cent, a combined total of 2
years and 5 months.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At home, they compiled 182 offenses; in
England, 27.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">At home, in the high addict-crime category of
theft, which included robbery and burglary, they committed 88; in
England, 8.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Not only did they commit far fewer crimes,
but, while in England, many of them were crime-free. In Canada,
16 of the 25 had committed five or more crimes, with one of them
recording more than 20 separate offenses. In Britain, none
committed more than four offenses and nearly half (12) were never
charged with any unlawful behavior.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Despite the fact that the Canadians consumed
far more daily heroin than the London average, many of them
became job holders and led fairly normal lives while in England.
Their living accommodations were far more stable. In Canada, only
five had a constant residence for more than three years; in
England, ten had lived at their present address for two or more
years, eight for one to two years, and five for less than one
year. Two were in the hospital at the time of the survey.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">The employment record showed the most dramatic
difference between the two countries. In Canada, only one addict
claimed to have worked steadily while addicted. In England, the
majority (13) worked full-time, and four worked part-time. Six
had held the same job for at least three years. Seven had
semiskilled or skilled manual jobs, two were office workers, one
in sales, and one worked as a croupier. One was a full-time
housewife and one a student. &quot;For once we could work and
live like humans,&quot; the addicts said. The interviews
contained again and again this and other personal and pragmatic
assessments. &quot;There is less trouble from the police . . . we
don't constantly have to be paranoid . . . there is less pressure
. . . there is no need to steal.&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">This study may encompass too small and special
a group of addicts to permit definitive conclusions. But,
together with the other fragmentary evidence, it suggests that
the English approach is an alternative not to be dismissed
summarily, as it is in a widely distributed U.S. Government
pamphlet, which claims that &quot;The British system is
considered a failure and has been modified to meet the increasing
problem of addiction.&quot;&quot; <br>
</font> </p>

<p> <i><font size="2">PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS<br>
</font></i> </p>

<p> <font size="2">For the American visitor, the most pervasive
impression of the English drug scene comes in the form of a
question:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Why has the United States, decade after
decade, continuously viewed narcotics addiction as largely a
criminal, instead of a medical, problem?</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">With all its imperfections and
inconsistencies, the British approach to drug addiction convinced
me that the United States will never make significant headway
with the drug problem until it shifts the emphasis from the
criminal to the medical. Until this national policy is changed,
American addicts will continue to be an ostracized
subculture-morally exiled and often barred from the very medical
and social-work help they need so desperately, but physically
very much present in the criminal countdown of the larger
society, which has had to lock itself behind doors for the luxury
of guarding an unworkable dogma.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Until this national policy is changed, the
black market will continue to flourish no matter how many more
narcotics agents are enlisted, and daily will help to infect
others, because of the astronomical profits to be made.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Based on my research in England, I believe
that the United States should experiment with both a methadone-
and -a heroin maintenance program under more controlled and
restrictive conditions than generally prevail in Britain today.</font>
</p>

<p> <font size="2">I believe that England provides significant
research opportunities about the effects of different opiates,
which could fill the knowledge void that is plaguing the
addiction field in so many countries. For example, what is the
precise difference between the effects of heroin and of injected
and oral methadone? What are the differences in work performance,
antisocial behavior, and life-styles among addicts who use heroin
and injectable and oral methadone? Because heroin addicts can be
observed in England under relatively controlled circumstances, a
whole series of comparative clinical and sociological studies are
possible.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">No simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;
answer can be given to the question: &quot;Is the British
approach to addiction a success or a failure?&quot; The question
itself may not be valid in a field that has so much difficulty
with the word &quot;success.&quot; A more accurate question may
be: Is the British approach to addiction helpful or harmful? Even
then, the answer may only be &quot;Yes, but . . .&quot;</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">Can the British and American approaches to
addiction legitimately be compared? The study of Canadian
addicts' performance in England certainly suggests that such
comparisons no longer can be dismissed out of hand. In England,
at least, comparisons are made. Everywhere I went, opinion on
this was uniform. On my final day in London, a Home Office
official, whose knowledge of drug addiction has brought him an
international reputation, summed it up:</font> </p>

<p> <font size="2">&quot;We don't want to force our system on
you, but for God's sake don't bring your system over here.&quot;<br>
