			<P>The goal of TVX Gold Inc.’s management team is to increase shareholder value by enhancing the Company's already substantial precious metal mining base. Specifically, by the year 2000, we plan to be producing over one 
million ounces annually and increase our reserves to 20 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent. In 1995, we continued to make steady progress towards achieving these objectives.
<P>Among the year's highlights were the start-up of the New Britannia mine in Manitoba and the completion of our purchase of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece.
<P>We brought our 50%-owned and operated New Britannia mine into production as planned in the fall, officially opening the mine on November 14. Its annual production is anticipated to average 100,000 ounces while ongoing exploration is expected to add significantly to the existing eight years of reserves.
<P>Our $46 million purchase of the Kassandra Mines assets was completed in December, adding approximately 4.3 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent to our reserves. We plan to construct an autoclave plant at this base metal operation in order to recover the gold in the ore which has previously been ignored due to its refractory nature. Gold equivalent production is expected to average 300,000 ounces annually during the initial years of operation and approximately 200,000 ounces per year thereafter over the life of the mine.

			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Financial Results</FONT>
			<P>TVX Gold's earnings in 1995 were $9.4 million, or $0.06 per share, compared to $22.8 million or $0.14 per share in 1994. Operating cash flow was $40.7 million or $0.26 per share, compared to $56.6 million and $0.36 per share in 1994. The decreases reflect higher operating and administrative costs, lower foreign exchange gains and increasing expenditures on exploration and business development as the Company pursues its aggressive growth strategy.
<P>Revenue in 1995 amounted to $156.9 million, similar to 1994's $157.2 million, resulting from the sale of 413,100 ounces of gold and gold equivalent in 1995 compared to 422,900 ounces in 1994. The Company's share of gold and gold equivalent production in 1995 was 423,100 ounces, approximately 3% less than the 1994 total of 436,900 ounces. Cash costs per ounce averaged $219, an increase of 10% over 1994's average of $199 per ounce, primarily as a result of higher unit operating costs, particularly at the Casa Berardi mine, and the effect of the appreciation of the local currency on operating costs at our Brazilian operations. TVX Gold's realized price averaged $380 per ounce, up from $372 per ounce in 1994.
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Operations</FONT>
			<P>TVX Gold's production in 1995 was derived from its direct and indirect interests in seven mines located in North and South America.  The Company operates the New Britannia and Casa Berardi mines in Canada and the Mineral Hill mine in the U.S.A. New Britannia poured its first gold in November, while the Novo Astro mine in Brazil ceased operations in July, its ore reserves mined out after more than a decade of production.
<P>The 50%-owned La Coipa mine in Chile is one of South America's largest precious metals mines and one of the world's lowest cost producers.  It contributed 48% or 204,600 ounces of gold and gold equivalent to TVX Gold's total 1995 production, almost 5% more than in 1994.  Cash operating costs averaged $168 per ounce, down $3 from 1994.
<P>In Brazil, production from the 50%-owned Crixas mine in 1995 was marginally higher than the previous year.  It contributed 63,300 ounces of gold or 15% of TVX Gold's total production, at an average cash cost of $177 per ounce compared to $170 per ounce in 1994.
<P>The Company's share of production from the Brasilia mine increased by 40% in 1995 to 53,600 ounces of gold, contributing 13% of the total annual production of TVX Gold, primarily as a result of the Company increasing its equity interest in the mine by 10% to 33%, effective January 25, 1995.  Cash costs at this low grade open pit operation averaged $235 per ounce in 1995, up from $196 in 1994, primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.  A planned expansion at Brasilia, which should add a further 30,000 ounces of gold annually to TVX Gold's total production commencing in 1998, will bring economies of scale to the mine's operating costs in the future.
<P>Before its reserves were exhausted in mid-1995, the Novo Astro mine contributed 22,700 ounces of gold, or 5% of the Company's 1995 total production, which is approximately half of the mine's 1994 contribution.  Cash costs averaged $183 per ounce, considerably less than the $238 per ounce cost in 1994, essentially due to higher grades and the cessation of production.
<P>Production from the 100%-owned Mineral Hill mine in Montana was 34,900 ounces or 8% of the Company's 1995 total. Declining grades and tonnage resulting from the depletion of reserves in the original deposit were responsible for an 11% decline from the previous year's output. As a result of this lower throughput, cash costs were $359 per ounce, up from $321 in 1994.
Development of the new Ski Slope zone discovered in mid-1995 should allow production to return to the 40,000 ounce level in 1996, while in 1997, with the anticipated start-up of production from the Crevice Mountain orebody, output is planned to reach 60,000 ounces.
<P>In Canada, the 60%-owned Casa Berardi operation provided 36,700 ounces of gold, or 9% of the Company's production total in 1995. This is almost 40% less than in 1994 as a result of limited stope availability. Cash costs increased to $449 per ounce compared to $227 in 1994, partially because of a shortfall in development in 1994 resulted in increased emphasis on development in 1995.
<P>The New Britannia mine contributed 7,300 ounces of gold to TVX Gold's 1995 production total in the last month and a half of 1995. This operation is expected to reach commercial production levels in the second quarter of 1996.
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Reserves</FONT>
			<P>TVX Gold increased its reserves by almost 69% in 1995. Proven and probable reserves contained 13.7 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent at year end, a significant jump from the 8.1 million ounces reported a year earlier. The increase reflects the inclusion of reserves from our Kassandra Mines and Asacha acquisitions and the Pachicutza project, as well as higher reserves at the Brasilia and Crixas operations and the Kasperske Hory project.
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Projects</FONT>
			<P>As expected, the decision to put into production the Musselwhite property in northern Ontario was made in February 1996, upon completion of a final feasibility study. TVX Gold has a 32% interest in this project and our share of reserves amounts to approximately 730,000 ounces of gold. Production is expected to commence in 1997 at an annual rate of 200,000 ounces of gold and infill drilling is expected to prolong mining well beyond the 11-year mine life on which the production decision was made.
<P>In the Czech Republic, we continue to enhance the reserve potential of our 100%-owned Kasperske Hory project. As a result of our $3 million exploration and development program in 1995, we increased total reserves to one million ounces of gold. Exploration efforts in 1996 will focus on adding to reserves.
<P>Our exploration on the Pachicutza project in Ecuador continues with 1996 development including driving an adit into the deposit from which further exploration and development can be carried out. Under consideration is the construction of a mine capable of producing approximately 58,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually along with a by-product zinc-lead concentrate over a 6-year period. The plant from the Novo Astro mine has been purchased and will be moved to the Pachicutza site.
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Acquisitions</FONT>
			<P>On December 21, 1995, TVX Gold completed the acquisition of the Kassandra Mines assets in Greece. In accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement, TVX Gold made an initial payment of approximately $19 million and will pay a total of approximately $27 million in five equal annual installments plus interest.
<P>In connection with this acquisition, TVX Gold is to receive grants from the Greek state representing 35% of eligible capital expenditures on the Kassandra Mines project. In accordance with Greek law, the award of grants is subject to ratification by the Greek Parliament.
<P>TVX Gold also acquired a 50% interest in the Asacha gold-silver deposit in southern Kamchatka in 1995 and has the contractual right, subject to Russian law, to increase its interest to 100%. A feasibility study is planned for 1996 with a view to confirming the potential of the deposit to support a mining operation.
			<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Future</FONT>
			<P>As we have noted in past years, TVX Gold's corporate strategy is to increase shareholder value by enhancing those key elements of our business that we can control and which most affect our share price. We pay careful attention to the quality and quantity of our reserves, to our production levels, cash costs, cash flow from operations and our earnings. In addition, our actions are conducted with full regard for our responsibilities, especially in the corporate responsibilities, especially in the areas of environment, health and safety, and community relations. At our existing operations there is continuing emphasis on cost reduction and the expansion of reserves and production. Beyond these operations we are seeking new growth in reserves and production through the acquisition, exploration and development of quality operations and properties with the potential for low operating costs and attractive profits.
<P>The Company's total production is planned to increase to 470,000 ounces of gold and gold equivalent in 1996, reflecting the contribution of the New Britannia mine. We should see further increases in production in 1997 due to higher planned output from Brasilia and Mineral Hill and initial production from Musselwhite. We expect to continue adding to and enhancing our reserves, through our acquisition strategy and our ongoing exploration and development programs. We are also optimistic about the reserve potential of the Kassandra Mines property.
<P>We would like to express our sincere appreciation to our directors and employees who, through their efforts, have made our many achievements to date possible.
<P>Our goal is to build our reserves to 20 million ounces of gold and gold equivalent while we increase annual production to over one million ounces by the year 2000. With major projects in Europe in addition to our North and South American operations, TVX Gold is committed to global success.
