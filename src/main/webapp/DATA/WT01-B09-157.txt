<B>Project Title:  Flywheel Magnetic Bearing Improvements<p>

Performing Organization:  AVCON

<P>Technical Contact:  Graham Jones, Avcon (818) 865-0250 voice mail, (818) 865-0206 fax<BR>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>AVCON has manufactured nine magnetic bearings for two different flywheel system designs and is currently under contract to manufacture magnetic bearings for four more flywheel projects.  The technology is now well established, and delivered systems are performing well.  There is a strong future for these type of bearings in flywheel applications.</P>

<P>For all flywheel applications the minimization of losses in the bearing is essential to achieve energy efficiency and cost effectiveness with the overall units.  The two main sources of power loss are the drag torque and the rotor heating which result from the eddy currents induced in the magnetic bearing rotor.  The drag torque is a continuous drain on the flywheel stored energy, and the rotor heating, inside the vacuum chamber, has to be removed by a cooling system.</P>

<P>During prototype testing the eddy current effect has not been shown to be significant.  For production units, however, it will be important to achieve the absolute minimum levels of eddy current losses.  This project will provide the data against which developing design tools can be correlated.</P>

<P>Currently there are no reliable design tools for accurate determination of these losses or for design optimization for minimum losses.  AVCON plans, therefore to develop such tools to improve the performance of high-speed magnetic bearing systems.</P>

<P>The program will begin with the analysis and optimization of magnetic bearing design, using computerized magnetic analysis and finite element analysis tools to select the most promising hardware configurations.  A full 5-axis active magnetic levitation system will then be fabricated, along with the necessary test rig, to measure and compare that rotor losses of the optimized system to an existing design.  This program will focus on minimizing or eliminating hysteresis effects and eddy-current generation, particularly at high rotational speeds.</P>


<P><B>Milestones</B></P>	
<P>
AVCON will design, fabricate, test and optimized magnetic bearing energy storage flywheel in 12 months.</P>
