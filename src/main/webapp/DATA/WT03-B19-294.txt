<P>
The CRC for Catchment Hydrology was formed in 1992 as a joint venture of three research and five water-industry parties. The centre brings together the combined resources, skills and expertise of research and industry groups to tackle major environmental concerns including salinity, flooding, degradation of rivers and streams, and pollution of stormwater in cities.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Centre skills and expertise have been focused on four research programs with individual projects developed with industry input:
<UL>
<LI>Catchment water and salt balance: studies of runoff and salinity processes in high water-table areas and of water yield from disturbed forest catchment areas.
<LI>Waterway management and erosion control: projects on the delivery of sediments and nutrients in water supply and the stability of stream channels.
<LI>Urban hydrology: projects aimed at water quality improvement in urban waterways.
<LI>Flood hydrology: studies of ways of improving flood warnings and flood runoff volumes.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
The centre has established an international reputation for its catchment hydrology research. Industry has participated actively in the support of the research, providing pilot or demonstration sites. Active collaboration has been achieved with national and international research centres and scholars.
Major contract R&D grants have been awarded to the CRC to investigate sustainable hardwood plantations in salty shallow water-tables and the role of streamside trees and grasses in protecting waterways.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
Australia faces significant losses each year due to land and water degradation. Flood damage is estimated at some $300 million annually, while agricultural production losses due to salinity amount to about $200 million each year.
The centre's core research programs have already produced results which are useful to the water industry, such as improved ways of estimating the impact of logging on water yield from forests, and detailed information on urban pollution sources.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Victoria is a focus for hydrology with major activity at Monash and Melbourne Universities. The involvement of Victorian government water and land management agencies and the location of the Bureau of Meteorology head-quarters in Melbourne have been important ingredients in facilitating the collaborative efforts of the Centre.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The education and training program provides a number of options to increase the number and ability of trained staff for the water in dustry. These include workshops for industry staff (water and irrigation authorities, land management agencies, consultants), postgraduate research and courses, seminars on centre research and related work, and staff interchange.

<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The rapid transfer of know-how to industry users is a major feature of the centre's technology transfer program through such activities as demonstration projects, staff exchanges and software products.
There are opportunities for companies to become involved in commercialising products such as software for modelling salinity or effluent. There is also the potential for consulting firms to link with the CRC in specialist tasks on land and water issues.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Each of the parties contributes cash or in-kind resources to the centre, which has a seven-year budget of $33 million. Other organisations are assisting with projects or funding contract research.
