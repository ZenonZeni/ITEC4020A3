More and
more investors, particularly manufacturers and distributors, are
finding Albury-Wodonga central to Australia's major markets, with
a logic to its location that's hard to beat.
<P>
Its strategic position astride the Sydney-Melbourne transport
corridor provides access to 75 per cent of the Australian domestic
market.

<H2>Albury-Wodonga Growth Centre</H2>

<P>
<img src="gifs2/albury1.gif" align=right>
Private investment is the best yardstick to measure the growth
of a region. Since the Growth Centre was established in 1974,
the private sector has invested $2.6 billion in Albury-Wodonga.
In 1992-93, $250 million was spent on buildings, plant and equipment.
<P>
Albury-Wodonga's rapid growth has been underpinned by the well-balanced
structure of its industry. In particular, the expansion of industry
in companies selling goods and services beyond the region has
been rapid in both new firms and in existing large businesses.
<P>
Consequently, private sector employment in Albury-Wodonga over
the past two decades has shown an impressive rate of growth. During
that period the average annual increase has been 3.7 per cent
compared with 1.6 per cent for Australia.
<P>
Around 3,500 businesses and public agencies in Albury-Wodonga
employ about 33,000 people.
<H2>Midway between major markets</H2>

<P>
Albury-Wodonga has a number of economic strengths that have made
it a location to be reckoned with by companies considering setting
up in Victoria.
<P>
It is at the hub of a road transport network that allows major
markets in Victoria and New South Wales to be serviced overnight.
It is only four hours (306 kilometres) from Melbourne by road
or train and 50 minutes by air, while the luxury XPT train running
between Sydney and Melbourne via Albury-Wodonga, carries passengers
at speeds up to 160 kilometres per hour. Travel time from Albury-Wodonga
to Sydney is about 7 1/2 hours.
<P>
Regular freight schedules operate to and from all capital cities,
with daily services to and from Melbourne. A number of express
road carriers also operate daily services to all main centres.
Rail freight rates are negotiable according to volume, frequency
and delivery requirements.
<P>
The Murray River flows through the centre of the region, providing
Albury Wodonga with a plentiful supply of good quality water.
A major electricity substation is located near Wodonga, and agreement
between the NSW and Victorian Governments to link their systems
ensures industry is provided supplementary power in the event
of shortfalls in either state's system.
<P>
Major industries with bulk power needs can negotiate concessions
with either Victorian or NSW electricity authorities.
<P>
Industries as large as Australian Newsprint Mills have negotiated
competitively priced electricity tariffs for their energy needs.
<P>
Natural gas is piped to Albury-Wodonga from Melbourne and is available
at Melbourne rates.
<H2>Industrial sites available</H2>
<P>
Fully serviced industrial estates, both private and those established
by the Develop Albury-Wodonga 2000, give industry a
wide selection of sites on which to establish a business.
<P>
Industrial estates established by the DAW 2000 include: Dallinger,
Thurgoona (NSW), Melrose, Kendall, and Baranduda (Vic). These
have been designed to ensure access to transport routes and facilities,
as well as proximity to residential areas.
<P>
The inventory of sites includes a wide range of opportunities
for both small and large developments. A variety of tenure options
is offered.
<H2>Diverse industry structure</H2>

<P>
Albury-Wodonga is home to a diverse industrial sector, with sixty-eight
categories of industry represented. About 3,500 businesses operate
here, and 420 of them employ between ten and 1,000 staff.
<P>
Manufacturing accounts for 18.9 per cent of the people employed
in Albury-Wodonga. Manufacturing is dominated by food processing,
which employs nearly 28 per cent of the region's manufacturing
workforce.
<P>
Uncle Ben's of Australia, for example, the nation's largest pet
food maker, employs over 900 people. The company has invested
more than $100 million in its Wodonga plant over the last few
years and accounts for more than half the total processed pet
food sales in Australia. It exports its products to a number of
countries, including Japan and Switzerland.
<P>
Other well-known manufacturers here include BTR Engineering, KimberleyClark,
ACI, Smorgon, Murray-Goulburn, Yakka, Cooper Tool, Moore Paragon,
Australian Newsprint Mills, CSR and Bunge.
<H2>Local resources</H2>

<P>
Agricultural products from the region and the surrounding area
provide the raw materials needed for food processing industries
in Albury-Wodonga. These include cereal grains such as wheat maize,
millet, and rice, which comes from the nearby Riverina.
<P>
Wine making at Rutherglen and Milawa is an important regional
industry. Regional wines are making an enormous impact at home
and overseas.
<P>
Albury-Wodonga's position as the largest centre along the Hume
corridor between Melbourne and Sydney and the availability of
a good supply of water, were crucial determinants in the development
of thriving paper manufacturing and printing firms in the area.
<P>
Two examples are Australian Newsprint Mills (ANM), employing 350
people, and Moore Paragon (paper converters), employing 320. Huge
softwood plantations within a 200 kilometre radius of Albury-Wodonga
have assisted the paper industry to grow.
<P>
Active participation by the Victorian and New South Wales Governments,
as well as from private plantation owners, has ensured continuity
of supply. ANM's recent newspaper recycling investment of $100
million will increase the local softwood supply by reducing ANM's
timber consumption by about 40 per cent.
<P>
Lower overheads, Albury-Wodonga's central location, an attractive
environment and reliable workforce were the reasons given by the
management of BTR Engineering for establishing their operation,
which employs about 650 people.
<P>
Albury-Wodonga offers the communications industry the infrastructure
and lifestyle advantages essential to its growth. The region has
access to the fibre optic cable that runs along the Hume corridor
between Melbourne and Sydney.
<H2>Tourist destination</H2>

<P>
Albury-Wodonga has become an important destination for tourists.
<P>
700,000 visitors annually spend 3.4 nights in the region, while
another 400,000 day visitors and tourists pass through.
<P>
In total, the tourism industry generated an estimated $160 million
and supported direct and indirect employment of nearly 3000 people.
<P>
The snowfields and winter resorts of Falls Creek, Mt Buffalo and
Mt Hotham are within easy driving distance for day trips from
Albury-Wodonga. The Murray River provides visitors with riverside
reserves and picnic areas, while days can be spent fishing for
trout, Murray cod and redfin.
<P>
Lake Hume is only fifteen kilometres from Albury-Wodonga. This
vast reserve provides opportunities for a variety of water sports
and boating on one of the most extensive and beautiful man-made
lakes in Australia. Other attractions for visitors are the many
vineyards around Rutherglen and Milawa, less than an hour's drive
from the city centre. Albury-Wodonga has plenty to offer in sporting
and recreational activities. There are five golf courses, more
than ninety outdoor bowling greens, seventy grass tennis courts
and many more hard courts, four public swimming pools and an international-standard
athletics track.
<P>
<H2>Wide choices in services</H2> 
<P>
Albury-Wodonga provides business, health, educational, community
and retail services to a regional market of 330,000 people within
a 150 kilometre radius.
<P>
Four major hospitals provide 441 beds to serve residents' health
needs. The services are backed by other specialist medical services
including pathology, radiology, and ultrasound laboratories, and
preventive health facilities such as infant welfare and baby health
centres, nursing homes, home help services and community nursing.
<P>
Major facilities provide technical and further education, with
an emphasis on employment and training. Significant recent expansion
of TAFE facilities has broadened and expanded educational and
training opportunities.

nursing and welfare studies are available at the Charles Sturt
University-Murray Campus, and La Trobe University's Albury-Wodonga
