<p align=center><strong>CANADA'S FISCAL CRISIS: THE FAILURE OF TAX REFORM </strong></p>
<p>Curiously, the current debate about how to deal with the federal deficit, and the apparent inexorability of the 
growing public debt, has not led to any widespread questioning and re-appraisal of the basic design of our systems 
of public finance. There is, for example, a general and justifiable belief in the tax community that we must overhaul 
or do away with the antiquated federal manufacturers sales tax. In doing so we are following, it is thought, the 
sensible and prudent tax policies of most other industrial countries by implementing a multi-stage or value-added 
sales tax. Unfortunately, there is little understanding in Canada of what such value-added consumption taxes have 
done to the economies of other countries. The Department of Finance appears to be simply of the view that since 
most other industrial countries have this type of tax it must be good.</p>
<p>However, the basic issue is not raised of whether or not it is sound policy to double tax individuals when earnings 
are received, through personal income taxes, and when after-tax disposable income is spent, through 
broadly-based consumption taxes. Many economists today make the argument that it is the income tax system 
which creates double taxation because it taxes both earnings and the income from savings or after-tax income. This 
is a rather strange view of what makes income from savings possible, but it is the source of much of the academic 
reasoning behind the general policy move towards higher consumption taxes. These economists have a negative 
orientation towards consumption, which leads them to the position that we should only be taxed on the basis of 
what we take out of the economy - hence the personal expenditure tax as a panacea for tax reform. Even less is it 
noted that historically governments often tend towards a greater reliance on consumption-type taxes in times of 
fiscal crisis. At any rate the so called penalty in the income tax system with respect to savings and double taxation 
would be virtually removed if income were taxed proportionally and not progressively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while it appears that few get exercised about the double and sometimes triple taxation of individual 
taxpayers per se, and the multiple taxation of business enterprises, &quot;tax cascading&quot; to borrow a phrase from the 
economics profession, we devise highly complex systems, such as the integration of the corporate and personal 
income tax systems, by means of such provisions as the &quot;dividend tax credit&quot;, in order to avoid double taxation in 
other areas. Similarly, our tax system is thought to be based on the vaguely defined principle of &quot;ability to pay&quot;, and 
yet there is much truth to the popular perception that the ministrations of tax professionals will undoubtedly lessen 
one's annual contribution to the public coffers. Ability to pay is thus very much conditioned by knowledge of the 
tax system and this knowledge is obviously not of equal distribution.</p>
<p>All levels of government generally focus their tax policies on taxable events engaged in by individuals. That is, when 
people do something it becomes taxable. We can call this in personam taxation because tax becomes payable or 
exigible when a person does something. For example, if you improve your house to a sufficient degree, it is 
re-assessed and your property tax increases. If you work over-time, you may find yourself in a higher tax bracket, 
and thus will have progressively less income, even though you have worked harder. If you run a small business, and 
lessen unemployment by hiring someone, your payroll tax will increase. And if you help local businesses by 
purchasing various consumer items, you pay more to the provincial and federal retail and sales tax systems.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that taxes normally tend to diminish the base upon which they are levied, it can be clearly seen that 
in personam taxes impinge negatively on worthwhile social and economic activities. It is good for your family and 
the community to improve your house, to work harder and be more productive, to hire, and to buy and sell the 
products created by labour and capital investment. </p>
<p>At all levels of government we tax in ways that are injurious to the economic and social fabric of the country. 
Municipalities levy taxes on total property values, which in theory are suppose to reflect our ability to pay property 
taxes. The end result, however, is runaway inflation in land prices, excessive housing costs, inefficient use of land 
resources in our urban economies, the high cost of municipal services associated with urban sprawl, and the 
widespread dissatisfaction of ratepayers with the methods of property assessment and evaluation conducted under 
the rubric of what is benignly, but deceptively, known as &quot;market value assessment&quot;.</p>
<p>Likewise, we tax business profits in the belief that profits are an accurate reflection of a corporation's ability to pay. 
The result is the widespread and inefficient inflation and accounting manipulation of business costs. There has been 
a predictable and significant decline in business profits as a percentage of gross domestic product over the past 
several decades. We have been left with a corporate tax system that has very high compliance costs. This system 
yields disappointingly little revenue to the government, and it violates its own principle by allowing many profitable 
companies to avoid paying taxes altogether.</p>
<p>Yet it would be futile to increase substantially the marginal rate on corporate profits given the evanescent quality of 
profits in general and the necessity of maintaining our international competitiveness, since we are a capital-importing 
country. In frustration the government is relying more and more on a &quot;capital&quot; tax to be levied on corporate capital 
employed in Canada in excess of $10 million. This is obviously a tax that has little to do with the ability-to-pay 
approach, and even less with any recognizable economic principle.</p>
<p>Why then do governments tax, or in effect punish individuals and businesses, for doing the very things that 
everyone would like to see encouraged? Are in personam taxes the only way governments can raise revenues? 
Must all taxes negate healthy economic activity and encourage deceit and subterfuge, albeit often finely nuanced 
and professionally articulated? Must all taxes promote those activities which are inimical to the advancement of 
communal well-being and to sound business investment and practices? Is it necessary to implement pervasive taxes 
on goods and services which will be inflationary and thereby fuel even further high interest rates and thus hasten the 
geometrical enlargement of the public debt? </p>
<p>The philosophical, economic and common sense answer to these questions is a decisive no. But to design a system 
of public finance based on sound principles that promote de-inflation, productivity, economic efficiency, 
job-creation, lower interest rates and a more fair and even distribution of wealth in our society will involve a 
fundamental critical analysis about what are the proper &quot;objects&quot; of taxation. My feeling is that we are not yet quite 
ready for such a global re-appraisal of our thinking. However, the loss of fiscal control and leverage over the 
economy by governments will, in the foreseeable future, result in sufficient socio-economic instability to force a 
transformation in thinking. Nevertheless, the parameters of the coming changes are broadly discernible.</p>
<p>Tax reform has been a feature of Canada's economic landscape for most of its fiscal history. The emphasis on 
technical and administrative adjustments in the Wilson White Paper of June, 1987, such as rate changes and certain 
base broadening measures, should not blind us to the fact that the tax reform debate has been traditionally 
interwoven with more expansive views of the role of government in our society and with the sociopolitical realities 
of a decentralized federal state such as Canada.</p>
<p>The ability-to-pay principle, erroneously declared by the Carter Commission in the 1960's to be the only 
theoretically defensible principle of taxation, gives governments extremely wide discretion to identify just about 
whatever they want as a suitable tax base. In England in the 18th century one was taxed on the basis of the number 
of windows and hearths in the home because it was believed these things reflected ability to pay. Predictably, 
people began bricking up windows and hearths. Likewise in Ontario, today, if more than $5,000 in improvements 
are added to a home your property taxes will increase, despite the fact that you may have made such 
improvements in order to allow your disabled son or daughter to reside at home rather than in an institution.</p>
<p>The ability-to-pay principle will always be the inevitable assumption underlying systems of taxation premised on an 
interventionist view of the state. It is also a principle that readily adheres to democratic governments for it allows 
politicians to make arbitrary and expedient dispensations to lobby groups and voters, by means of tax expenditures 
and other provisions, without having to take the responsibility for direct budgetary expenditures. The people are 
therefore continually bribed with the usufruct of their own labour and fiscal policy becomes subject to the 
vicissitudes of electoral politics. The Auditor-General himself has said that &quot;the lack of control in the use of tax 
expenditures may well represent one of the most serious voids in the parliamentary control over the public purse in 
Canadian history&quot;. The irony is that ultimately the ability-to-pay principle, unrelated to the benefits principle of 
taxation, leads to the erosion of democracy and representative government.</p>
<p>Ability to pay cannot, however, be ignored in the design of any tax system. It would be quite unconscionable and 
immoral to tax the poor more than the rich, even though in many respects this does happen today. In genuine tax 
reform, ability to pay ought to guide us to equitable, non-arbitrary, and economically sound &quot;objects&quot; of taxation. 
This means that we must start thinking more in terms of in rem, rather than of in personam, types of taxation if we 
are to achieve real and equitable reform of the tax system.</p>
<p>What does in rem taxation mean? Fundamentally, it signifies a drawing back from the taxation of individuals and 
labour income per se to tax systems which recapture for the public treasury community-created values that are not 
the result of the individual processes of labour but value increments which result from the benefits and privileges 
that are conferred by the community at large.</p>
<p>What are the primary things that benefit from the provision of government services and from the material progress 
of society in general? Certainly, the locational values of real estate benefit tremendously from the provision of 
tax-funded services and from the growth of the community. Since these values are created by the community and 
not the individual, does it not make sense that the community should tax back some of this value, irrespective of the 
use to which a site is put, in order to provide for these services. There is also considerable empirical evidence to 
show that the taxation of site values, rather than improvement values, which are created by individuals, can go a 
long way towards reducing the cost of housing, while at the same time providing a stable and equitable form of 
revenue for municipal governments. In tax jurisdictions where site value taxation has been implemented most 
homeowners who live and work in the community receive a reduction in property taxes.</p>
<p>Corporations and businesses benefit from the provision of government services and therefore should pay taxes to 
provide for these benefits. The taxation of corporate and business profits, however, is a form of in personam 
taxation since profits rightfully belong to investors, or the individuals who provide capital to create and run 
businesses, and not to the companies themselves. In rem taxation of companies would be on that income which 
they expend in the creation of wealth or value. The more income expended on creating value the greater the ability 
to pay of the corporation since it is adding more and more to the general fund of wealth. This ability to pay is also a 
reflection of benefits received from the government. It is the price which must be built into the costing analysis of 
the process of creating goods and services. That businesses are able to produce such wealth depends on the 
provision of governmental benefits and sometimes special privileges. It is the current obfuscation of what is 
properly meant by corporate or business income that has led to the present inability of governments to tax 
businesses in a way that will enhance productivity and efficiency, while at the same time providing a stable and 
unavoidable revenue base.</p>
<p>Then there is the difficult question of whether individuals should be taxed at all. Some economists and political 
philosophers have argued that the total recapture of the economic rent of the country by the government would be 
sufficient to cover all public expenditures. Under the present tax system we do little to recapture economic rent or 
the community-created value of all natural, primarily land, resources in the country. The untaxing of labour and 
capital, and the uptaxing of land resources would be a fundamental inversion of current tax thinking, which is 
focused primarily on the taxation of labour. This is an issue that will have to be confronted at some point, but I 
suspect we will continue to tax primarily individuals in the foreseeable future. An argument can be made that 
because individuals in modern society receive the benefit of the provision of a large number of services from the 
government they ought to pay on a pro rata basis for the cost of these services.</p>
<p>It would be more equitable, then, to tax individuals proportionally on their income. A low, proportional rate on all 
individual earnings above the poverty line would greatly simplify the tax system while at the same time yielding a 
reliable source of revenue to the public treasury. Indeed, it has been empirically shown that a proportional rate 
results in more revenue received from higher income groups than under a progressive system primarily because of 
the elimination of most tax expenditures, exemptions, deductions, and a reduction in the incentive to avoid taxation. 
It is therefore more &quot;progressive&quot; to institute a proportional income tax rather than continue with the regressivity in 
the current nominally progressive system. Nevertheless, it is imperative that a shift towards a low proportional tax 
on individual income, and the eventual elimination of counterproductive consumption taxes, be accompanied by a 
widespread movement towards the taxation of site values and businesses as recommended above.</p>
<p>How is all of this possible in a regionalized federal state like Canada? How can thousands of municipalities be 
persuaded to tax site, rather than in personam improvement, values? How can the provinces and the federal 
government coordinate the taxation of business enterprises on the in rem basis of income expended in the creation 
of wealth rather than relying heavily on counterproductive sales taxes?.</p>
<p>The answer has to lie in making explicit an overarching philosophy of taxation, the implementation of which would 
ease the tax burden on most individuals and thereby free up their labour income and capital for economic activity 
that will benefit themselves and the community as a whole. Everyone will then see that it is in their interest to adopt 
sound principles of taxation which promote equity and healthy economic progress. The tax reform process will not 
be completed with the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, as the Department of Finance would have 
us believe, but has yet to begin in earnest.</p>
