<DD>You're looking good, you're active, maybe you're a top performer at work. The fact remains that it's time to start thinking about a new, imminent responsibility - as a retiree. Are you ready? With a life expectancy longer than any generation before you, you had better be. (Haven't you heard - superheroes live forever!)<P>

<DT><IMG SRC="gifs/getready2_subhead.gif" WIDTH=298 HEIGHT=17 ALT="How broad are those shoulders?">
<DD>Of course, you may expect to always be there for your parents, for your children and for your dear friends. But who are you turning to for help? There's no need to make your retirement planning decisions on your own. For a comprehensive overview of the range of investments available and their suitability for your circumstances, call on a financial representative. <P>

<DT><IMG SRC="gifs/getready3_subhead.gif" WIDTH=224 HEIGHT=17 ALT="Will you have enough?">
<DD>For your retirement years, you may need about 70 to 80 percent of the salary you made in your
highest earning years. How much can you count on from Uncle Sam? You can go to
<A  HREF="http://www.ssa.gov/">Social Security Online</A> or call 1-800-772-1213 to request
an Earnings and Benefit Statement (SSA-7004) from the Social Security Administration. The statement
estimates your future benefits.<P>

<DT><IMG SRC="gifs/getready4_subhead.gif" WIDTH=268 HEIGHT=17 ALT="A nice watch and what else?">
<DD>Are you counting on your employer to provide more than just a gold watch at retirement? Depending on your age and years of service, you may qualify for a full, partial or no pension at all from your employer. You'll want to ask your company pension plan administrator for details about your company's vesting, distribution (lump sum or rollover) and payment options. <P>

<DT><IMG SRC="gifs/getready5_subhead.gif" WIDTH=228 HEIGHT=17 ALT="Still weak in the knees?">
<DD>Of course you would be, when you consider the total sum that you may need to finance a 30-year retirement. One suggestion: Focus on the amount of money that you'll need on a monthly basis, and your financial representative may be able to develop an investment plan capable of meeting your monthly needs. <P>

<DT><IMG SRC="gifs/getready6_subhead.gif" WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=17 ALT="Don't just stand there!">
<DD>As important as all your other responsibilities may be to you, now is the time for you to make tracks in planning for the retirement that you deserve. The Social Security Administration and your employer can tell you about how much they'll be contributing - the question is: What more can <I>you</I> do? Leaping into action on your personal saving and investing now can help make a big difference 10 years from now. Get ready to retire!<P>
