<H3>KEMPER FINANCIAL COMPLETES ACQUISITION
OF DREMAN VALUE MANAGEMENT ASSETS; NAMES PRESIDENT &amp; CEO OF ACQUIRED
OPERATIONS</H3>


<B>CHICAGO</B> (August 24) - Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS), a
subsidiary of Kemper Corporation (NYSE: KEM) and the investment advisor
to the Kemper Mutual Funds, today announced the completion of the
acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Dreman Value
Management, L.P. (DVM), including assignment of the Dreman mutual funds
advisory contracts. Specific terms of the transaction were not
disclosed.
<P>

Separately, the company announced that James R. Neel has been named
president and chief executive officer of Kemper Advisors, Inc., a
subsidiary of KFS and the investment advisor to the Kemper-Dreman funds.
<P>

The Dreman mutual funds will be renamed as follows: 
the <A HREF="../../funds/high_return.html"> Kemper-Dreman
High Return Fund</A>, the <A HREF="../../funds/smallcap.html">
 Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund</A>, the
<A HREF="../../funds/contrarian.html"> Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A> 
and the Kemper-Dreman Fixed Income Fund.
<P>

"The closing of this transaction is significant because it immediately
allows us to provide retail and institutional clients with an enhanced
product offering that includes the value style of equity investing,"
said Stephen B. Timbers, chairman and chief executive officer of KFS.
"Furthermore, the acquisition affords Kemper tremendous flexibility in
bringing new products to market."
<P>

As previously reported, the investment functions of KFS and the acquired
operation will remain separate. David Dreman will remain as chairman of
the acquired operation. "We are extremely pleased that David will
continue to play an integral role in the new company, including his
active participation in managing key retail and institutional
portfolios," said Timbers.
<P>

The acquired operation will continue to be based in New Jersey. "By
keeping the investment functions separate, we believe that the
operations will retain the integrity of their investment process and
discipline," said Timbers.
<P>

Neel most recently was an executive vice president and equity portfolio
manager for Kemper Financial's institutional accounts. Prior to that he
managed several of the Kemper retail mutual funds and served as chief
equity strategist. He has been with KFS for six years. Before joining
KFS, Neel was with Loomis Sayles &amp; Co. where he managed a variety of
investment portfolios.
<P>

"We are delighted to have a person of Jim's caliber in the role of
president and CEO," said Timbers. "He is a highly qualified and
recognized professional in the investment community. His experience
coupled with his knowledge of Kemper will benefit him significantly in
his new position."
<P>

KFS has approximately $43.7 billion in mutual fund assets under
management, including 30 open-end funds and seven closed-end funds, as
of July 31, 1995. KFS' domestic institutional subsidiary, Kemper Asset
Management Company, has approximately $5.3 billion under management, not
including assets managed for Kemper Corporation's affiliates and the
Kemper National Insurance Companies. The acquired operation currently
has approximately $1.5 billion of institutional assets under management.
<P>

Kemper Financial Services, Inc. is one of the nation's largest asset
managers with more than $63 billion under management. It is a subsidiary
of Kemper Corporation, a holding company with principal operations in
asset management and life insurance.
