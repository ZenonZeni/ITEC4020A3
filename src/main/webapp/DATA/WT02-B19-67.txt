<p>
The Department of Mechanical and Industrial 
Engineering has in place an advisory committee to help 
maintain a strong computer network for graduate 
teaching and research.  The department employs two 
full- time computing-support staff, who are in charge of 
maintaining the integrity of the departmental computer 
network, installation of equipment and software, and 
responding to user problems.<p>

The latest computing technology is provided in a 
network of Sun workstations and servers.  NCD X-
terminals attached to 3 Sun central servers, a SPARC 
10/512,  a SPARC 20/612, and an Ultra 1 provide high 
level graphics capabilities.  Additional graphics seats are 
provided by 5 Sun SPARC 2 workstations, used 
cooperatively through the Center for Computer 
Integrated Engineering (CCIE).  Numerous software 
packages are available, including SDRC/I-DEAS, ANSYS, 
Open Windows, IMSL, MATLAB, FRAMEMAKER, FLUENT, 
TECPLOT and  MAPLE.  <p>

In addition to departmental research computers, 
numerous research laboratories have dedicated 
computer systems as well. In all, there are about 60 
interlinked computer systems with close to 100 terminals 
connected to the central computing facilities. <p>

The department has also established good 
communication links with the Engineering Computing 
Facility (ECF).  The service provided by the ECF is 
primarily for teaching, but may also be used for research 
activities as required. ECF operates a large network of 
over 30 Sun workstations and 100 NCD X-terminals 
served by an SGI Challenge L, two Challenge Ss and SGI 
40/380s.  <p>
