<H3>Background of <I>BioGlobe</I> Web site and Mailing List:</H3><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Emerging and established biotechnology companies in the US and Europe have identified Japanese companies as potential commercial partners and visit Japan regularly to develop relationships that hopefully lead to technology-related partnerships, investment, and research funding. To facilitate development of these relationships, several organizations and consulting groups have organized partnering conferences to bring biotechnology closer to interested Japanese companies in the hope that discussions will lead to partnering agreement supporting research and product development by the biotech partner. US and European biotech companies are realistic in their aspirations, and see business cooperation with Japanese companies as a potential source of funding in return for technology rights for Japanese and SEA markets where their technology would otherwise go undeveloped.<P>

Japanese companies, on the other hand, are finding themselves having to respond to changes in the Japanese pharmaceutical environment caused in part by government's response to rising healthcare costs:<P>

&#42     Forced to take more risk by the changing regulatory environment- i.e., pricing guidelines that reward innovation.<BR>
&#42     Must compete among themselves and with foreign-affiliated companies for technology that allows breakthrough innovation.<BR>
&#42     Western companies are more and more proactive in obtaining Japan/SEA rights in their biotechnology deals and are willing to provide the same financial terms as Japanese companies as part of a worldwide agreement.<BR>
&#42     Foreign-affiliated companies are more willing than Japanese companies to assume high risk projects while providing for the long-term strategic interests of their biotech partner.<P>

The vast number of biotechnology companies visiting Japan to present their technology, however, has overwhelmed the capacity for most Japanese companies to understand, both scientifically and commercially, the implications of the technology presented and make informed investment decisions. The consequence many times is a polite hearing and lunch, with the biotechnology message lost or not entirely appreciated. Biotechnology companies leave feeling  good, when in reality they are the victims of Japanese politeness. This scenario can be avoided on both sides by more focused presentations to companies pre selected based on research and commercial interests, given an opportunity to review and comment informally on introductory information provided by the biotechnology company. BioGlobe provides a communication tool to allow both Japanese and emerging biotechnology companies a competitive advantage to make productive use of time and money in progressing partnering initiatives and relationship building in Japan.<P>

BioGlobe provides an interface between Western and Japanese business cultures, allowing each side to better appreciate the nuances of 'deal making' in Japan. Differences in definition of risk, an appreciation of the regulatory and commercial healthcare environment, which, for many technologies is problematical, and problems inherent in communicating in a second language for Japanese can be attenuated, allowing quality communication between both scientists and commercial people on both sides of the discussion. BioGlobe and <A HREF = "Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A>, on behalf of subscribing companies , can facilitate opportunities, technical assessments and deal making, increasing understanding and the probability that an agreement will emerge.
<P>

<A HREF = "Companies/koseisho.html">Koseisho</A> (Ministry of Health and Welfare) understand that cutting-edge healthcare technology is required for the Japanese pharmaceutical industry to remain worldwide players and for government to reduce healthcare costs. <A HREF = "Companies/koseisho.html">Koseisho</A> is lending support to BioGlobe to encourage interaction with both themselves, providing dialogue as they consider new regulatory policies, and industry to progress government's responsibility to society in providing the best healthcare possible.<P>

<A HREF="Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A> is both a biotechnology company with its own research programs, and an asset-development company focused on value-added bi-directional biopharmaceutical technology transfer between Japan/SEA and the West. <A HREF = "Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A> is funded by several US and European venture capital groups, and has successfully concluded partnering relationships in Japan for both its own technologies and several US biotechnology companies.<P>

<A HREF = "Companies/krp.html">Kyoto Research Park</A> (<A HREF="Companies/krp.html">KRP</A>), 100% subsidiary of Osaka Gas company, where 80 companies and R&D institutions are located in the center city of Kyoto, operates a research park.  KRP consists of 8 buildings and has three primary objectives:<P>

<UL><LI>Promotion of technological innovation and the development of new core technologies.
<LI>To foster the development of high technology venture businesses.
<LI>To facilitate entry by foreign firms into the Japanese market.
</UL>

Among <A HREF="Companies/krp.html">KRP's</A> support services, <A HREF="Companies/krp.html">KRP</A> organizes the Life Science Technology Transfer Forum (LSTTF), which encourages information exchange between industry and academia in life science-related fields.  It also provides foreign firms with opportunities to meet the LSTTF members through presentation, exhibition and business matching meeting, etc. at the LSTT forum.<P>

<A HREF = "http://www.generics.co.uk">Generics Group</A> is a uniquely innovative global organisation combining excellence in the strategic application of technology in business. Founded in 1986 it is already Europe's leading laboratory based business and technology consulting and investment company.<A HREF = "http://www.generics.co.uk">Generics</A> is  the preferred partner of many major international corporations in the US, Japan and Europe. <A HREF = "http://www.generics.co.uk">Generics</A> also invests in its own scientific research programmes in many areas in addition to the Life Sciences, for example, in new materials, optics and magnetics. These are then commercialised through royalties or through incorporation in a new business venture. The Group has therefore extensive experience in creative technology transfer between and within corporations in most industry sectors. <A HREF = "Companies/sosei.html">Sosei</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.generics.co.uk">Generics</A> intend to collaborate further in  pursuit of their common goals to establish the most effective and efficient R&D system from a global perspective.<P>
 
<A HREF = "http://www.bio.org/biocentury/index.html">BioCentury</A> is widely known as the leading provider of analysis, interpretation and commentary relating to biotechnology industry development, corporate strategy, and shareholder value.  BioGlobe and <A HREF = "http://www.bio.org/biocentury/index.html">BioCentury</A> are mutually hyperlinked to each other's home page to facilitate collaborations.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
