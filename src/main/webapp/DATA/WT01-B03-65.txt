an Effective Ayurvedic Remedy for Diabetes</H2>
<BR>
<B>An article by Dr. Kumar Pati, from New Editions Health World Magazine<BR>
</B><HR WIDTH="88%" SIZE="11"><B>Burlingame, CA - </B>Today, modern Western
medicine make use of a number of Ayurvedic medicines, including Rauwolfia
serpentina as an antihypertensive, Commiphora mukul as an anti-inflammatory,
and Garcinia cambogia for weight loss.Another of these Ayurvedic herbs is
known to scientists by its two different botanical names, Gymnema sylvestre
and Asclepias geminata.<BR>

<P><B><I>Gymnema sylvestre</I></B> is a woody, vine-like plant which climbs
on bushes and trees. The medicinally active parts of the plant are the leaves
and the roots. It came to be known as &quot;destroyer of sugar&quot; because,
in ancient times, Ayurvedic physicians observed that chewing a few leaves
of Gymnema sylvestre suppressed the taste of sugar. That is, sweet foods
no longer tasted sweet, but rather became almost completely tasteless. In
later generations, clinical tests showed that regular use over a period
of three to four months helped to reduce glycosuria, or the appearance of
carbohydrates in urine. Recent clinical trials conducted in India have shown
that an extract of Gymnema sylvestre is useful in both insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and in certain specific types of non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).<BR>
<BR>
As a result of these clinical tests and years of successful treatments,
Gymnema sylvestre is used today for treating diabetes mellitus. In reducing
the symptom of glycosuria, the dried leaves are used in daily doses of three
to four grams for a period of three months or more.<BR>
<BR>
Studies conducted in India as early as 1930 showed that the leaves of Gymnema
sylvestre cause hypoglycemia in experimental animals. This state of hypoglycemia
is explained on the assumption that the drug indirectly stimulates the insulin
secretion of the pancreas, since it has no direct effect on the carbohydrate
metabolism. 
<H2><A NAME="anchor1668145"></A>How Gymnema sylvestre Works</H2>
Recent pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that Gymnema sylvestre
acts on two sites: 
<UL>
<LI>First, the taste buds in the oral cavity; 
<LI>Second, the absorptive surface to the intestines. 
</UL>
<BR>
The structure of those taste buds which detect sugar in the mouth is similar
to the structure of the tissue that absorbs sugar in the intestine. The
important active ingredient of Gymnema sylvestre is an organic acid called
&quot;gymnemic acid.&quot; The gymnemic acid is made up of molecules whose
atom arrangement is similar to that of glucose molecules. Those molecules
fill the receptor locations on the taste buds for a period of one to two
hours, thereby preventing the taste buds from being activated by any sugar
molecules present in the food. Similarly, the glucose-like molecules in
the gymnemic acid fill the receptor locations in the absorptive external
layers of the intestine, thereby preventing the intestine from absorbing
the sugar molecules.<BR>
<BR>
It has also been noted that Gymnema sylvestre takes away the bitter taste
of bitter substances, such as quinine, in much the same way that it affects
the sense of sweetness associated with candies and other sweet foods. However,
it has no effect on pungent, salty, astringent or acidic tastes. Therefore,
if you are eating an orange within two hours after chewing Gymnema sylvestre
leaves, for instance, you would taste the sourness of it but not the sweetness.

<B>The benefits of Gymnema sylvestre are two-fold:</B> 
<OL>
<LI><B>1 )</B> By suppressing the taste of sweet foods, the desire to eat
them is also suppressed. Picture a luscious-looking large piece of chocolate
candy, which you know, despite the tempting look, is not sweet. Why bother
to eat it? It is important to remember that this effect of Gymnema sylvestre's
will last for only one to two hours. If you are using the herb to break
the sugar habit, then it would be wise to take some Gymnema sylvestre before
social events or other times when you might be tempted to dive into the
tray of sweets. 
<LI><B>2 )</B> Gymnema sylvestre significantly reduces the metabolic effects
of sugar by preventing the intestines from absorbing the sugar molecules
during the process of digestion. Because there is a change in the absorption
of sugar, there is a consequent change in the blood sugar level.

<H2><A NAME="anchor1650834"></A>Types of Diabetes</H2>
Diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by a deficiency in the production
of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas. There are two types of diabetes,
Type I and Type II. Type I diabetes is usually diagnosed in childhood and
involves such a severe depletion of insulin that it must be taken by injection
everyday. Type II diabetes is usually diagnosed in adulthood, and most often
can be managed with diet and oral medication rather than insulin injections.
<BR>
<BR>
Symptoms of diabetes include increased frequency of urination, increased
and often extreme thirst, increased appetite, weight loss, irritability,
and fatigue. Excessive bedwetting is a classic sign of diabetes. These symptoms
usually appear over a period of about three weeks. <BR>
<BR>
Short-term complications of diabetes include episodes of both very low and
very high blood sugar.<BR>
Diabetes can also lead to long-term complications. These include changes
in vision, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and nerve problems. Careful
treatment of diabetes, conscientious compliance with treatment, and regular
doctor appointments can help prevent complications from development. 
<H2><A NAME="anchor1633521"></A>Treatment of Diabetes with Gymnema sylvestre</H2>
Trials under experimental and clinical conditions have shown significant
results in the treatment of diabetes with Gymnema Sylvestre. Remarkably,
unlike insulin or oral hypoglycemic suphonylurea compounds, the hypoglycemic
effects of Gymnema sylvestre are seen in only a small percentage of the
diabetic patients. For most people, blood sugar lowers to normal levels;
it does not lower to a point below normal blood sugar levels. This can happen
in a small number of patients, however, because the mechanisms of the diabetic
syndrome vary with different patients. In recent years IDDM has been observed
to have entirely different pathophysiology and clinical course from NIDDM.
The studies have suggested that Gymnema sylvestre may be useful in certain
specific types of NIDDM, in addition to its general usefulness in IDDM.<BR>
<BR>
The safety of Gymnema sylvestre has been demonstrated by the fact that it
has been safely and successfully used for more than 2,000 years in traditional
Ayurvedic medicine. 
<H2><A NAME="anchor1637678"></A>Other Uses of Gymnema sylvestre</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Snakebite is treated by dusting the wound with powdered root, or applying
a paste of the root powder to the wound. 
<LI>Fever is treated with an oral administration of half an ounce to an
ounce (1 part in 10) of leaves. 
<LI>Swollen glands are treated with an external application of triturated
leaves mixed with castor oil. 
</UL>
<H2>Examining Label Claims</H2>
Today, the active ingredients are extracted and produced in capsules and
tablets and available worldwide. This is a very welcome circumstance, but,
like all herbal products on the shelf, there is a variety of potencies among
the different brands. Unfortunately, there are some ambiguities in the product
nomenclature. Some products are said to contain 85 percent gymnemic acid,
but the &quot;85 percent&quot; refers to the extraction efficacy, and not
the percentage of gymnemic acids. In fact, in all Gymnema sylvestre extracts,
gymnemic acid occurs in crude form along with other constituents. Therefore,
it is recommended to take in <A HREF="teaorderinfo.html">tea form</A> for
best results. 
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
By virtue of its non-toxic nature and sweetness-suppression activity, Gymnema
sylvestre can play a significant role in the treatment of various conditions
caused by excessive sugar intake. More commonly seen conditions are diabetes,
obesity, hypoglycemia. The combination of Gymnema sylvestre with other drugs
and therapies can make the treatment more effective. This combining, and
all herbal treatments for conditions such as diabetes, should be done with
the advice and consultation of a holistic physician. As discussed, there
is a variety of strengths and qualities among Gymnema sylvestre products
on the shelves. Since it works the same way on sweet taste sensors as it
does in the intestine, you should be able to detect the difference between
effective and ineffective Gymnema sylvestre by its effect on sweet taste.
