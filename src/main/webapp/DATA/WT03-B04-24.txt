PROPOSALS FOR THE FINAL STAGE OF ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION

from EUROPEAN INSIGHT, 18 October 1996, No. 720

On October 16, the European Commission unveiled proposals on the stability
pact meant to maintain budgetary discipline in the countries of the Euro
zone, on the legal status of the single currency and on procedures aimed
at strengthening convergence in the Member States that do not participate
in the final phase of Economic and Monetary Union from the outset
("pre-ins"). The Commission is preparing draft Regulations and a
Communication to be submitted to the Council of Finance Ministers in
November and December so that the Dublin Summit on December 13 and 14 can
proceed with the final adoption of the architecture of the future Monetary
Union, set to come into being on January 1, 1999. These proposals will
take into account the conclusions of the informal Finance Council held in
Dublin on September 20 and 21 and the meeting of the EU's influential
Monetary Committee on October 8.

Legal status of the Euro

A pair of draft Regulations designed to guarantee the continuity of
contracts denominated in national currencies and offer legal security to
Euro users, between January 1, 1999 (the start of the final stage of
Economic and Monetary Union) and the complete demise of national
currencies (no later than six months after January 1, 2002) were approved
by the European Commission The first Regulation clearly confirms the
continuity of legal instruments, not least contracts, would be ensured
between the older national currencies and the Euro and between the ECU and
the Euro. It specifies in Article 2 that as soon as EMU stage three comes
into being any reference to the ECU shall be replaced by a reference to
the Euro. The conversion rate is one Euro for one ECU. Starting on January
1, Regulation 3320/94, which fixes the composition of the ECU basket of
currencies, will be repealed. Article 3 of the proposal says the Euro does
not allow a party to a legal instrument the right to change it or
unilaterally cancel it. As for conversion rates, Article 4 envisages four
specific provisions:

- Conversion rates express the value of one Euro in each of the national
currencies taking part in the process. They comprise six key figures; -
The rates may not be rounded off nor truncated during conversion; - They
are used for conversion between the Euro unit and national monetary units
or the other way round. Reverse rates calculated on the basis of
conversion rates may not be used; - Any amount to be converted from a
national monetary unit into another has first of all to be converted into
a Euro-denominated monetary amount, rounded off to three decimals then
converted into the other national monetary unit. The second Regulation
provides that the single currency will be divided into100 sub-divisions
called "cents" and will expressly include the list of countries taking
part in the final phase. During the transitional period, due to get under
way on January 1, 1999, and end on December 31, 2001 at the latest, the
Member States will be entitled to convert outstanding amounts of debts
(bonds and loan securities) denominated in a national currency unit. The
markets could also replace the national currency in the accounts of their
operating procedures by the Euro. Notes and coins denominated in a
national currency unit keep their legal rates within the countries
concerned during the above-mentioned transitional period. By January 1,
2002 at the latest, the ECB and the central banks of the participating
countries would place Euro-denominated notes into circulation (notes and
coins may be introduced for practical reasons before the end of the
transitional period). Six months after the end of the transitional period,
national currencies would cease to be legal tender.

Stability pact.

The EMU stability pact will be based on two draft Regulations defining a
system of sanctions for countries violating the criteria (as provided for
in Article 104c of the Maastricht Treaty) and will establish a system of
reinforced convergence via stability programmes to prevent budgetary
excesses on the part of the countries of the Euro zone. The Regulation on
sanctions is to take effect on January 1, 1999, while that on reinforced
convergence is scheduled to enter into force on July 1, 1998. The
Commission provides for each Member State participating in EMU to present
a compulsory and regularly updated stability programme setting out
medium-term macro-economic objectives. These programmes will be made
public in the interests of transparency. The stability programme will
commit the Member States to correcting any budgetary excesses. An early
warning system will also be introduced, based on the stability programme
and provisions for implementation established by the Commission, to put a
halt to any slippage of the budget deficit well before it reaches the
maximum value of 3% of GDP. If, despite warnings, a Member State's
financial position continues to deteriorate, the Council of Ministers may
decide to apply the sanctions procedure. If, in fact, an excessive deficit
does exist, the Council will immediately address recommendations to the
Member State in question and give it a deadline for correcting the
situation. The Member State will have ten months from the time of
determination of an excessive deficit to take the necessary action before
sanctions are imposed. The first penalty would be applied in the form of a
non-interest-bearing deposit, comprising a fixed part (0.2% of GDP) and a
variable part (0.1%) of GDP per deficit point higher than the 3% budget
deficit limit. A maximum penalty value equal to 0.5% of GDP will
theoretically be chosen. The afore-mentioned final figures might well be
revised between now and the Commission meeting on October 16. If the
Member States fail to cut their excessive deficits dow

 to size within two years, the deposit would be converted into a fine.

The European Commission has adopted a communication to the Council on
reinforced convergence procedures and a new exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
The ERM will be a temporary waiting room for countries preparing to join
monetary union. In line with the recommendations of the European Monetary
Institute (EMI), there is a broad consensus among Member States on a "hub
and spoke" arrangement of bilateral links between the Euro and pre-in
currencies. The fluctuation margins will in general be relatively wide,
with the possibility of closer links for countries with sufficiently
strong convergence performance: intervention by the European Central Bank
will be automatic at the margin of the fluctuation bands. However, it may
be suspended (and realignment discussions initiated) where the level of
intervention is incompatible with a monetary policy geared towards price
stability.

Building on existing procedures for the examination of national
convergence programmes and multilateral surveillance of economic policies
(under Article 103 of the Treaty), the Commission envisages the following
innovations:

- all pre-ins would be formally obliged to submit convergence programmes.

- the first programmes in this new generation would be submitted before 1
January 1999.

they would be updated annually.

- convergence programmes would contain more detail than at present, in
particular on the measures envisaged to achieve the convergence objectives
in terms of public finances, inflation and exchange rate stability. They
might also contain indications of the supplementary action envisaged to
correct any slippage from agreed targets.

a more precise timetable would be set for the examination of national
programmes by the Council.

- the Council would have the right to endorse a country's convergence
programme after detailed examination and analysis by the Commission and
the Monetary Committee (which will be succeeded by the Economic and
Financial Committee on 1 January 1999).

- the Council would exploit to the full the procedures of Article 103 of
the Treaty, in particular the possibility to make policy recommendations
(if appropriate publicly) to countries whose economic performance deviates
from agreed objectives.
