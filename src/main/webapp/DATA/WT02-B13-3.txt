<P>

<CENTER>American Institute for Contemporary German Studies</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>The Friedrich Ebert Stiftung </CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>and the </CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>Comparative Immigration and Integration Program </CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>of the University of California Center for German and

European Studies<BR>

</CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>on Tuesday March 28, 1995 </CENTER>

<P>

<CENTER>in Washington DC<BR>

</CENTER>

<P>

About 8 percent of the populations of Germany and of the US are

foreigners. Both countries are struggling to manage the influx

of foreigners, integrate resident foreigners, and do both in an

humane and durable fashion.<BR>


<P>

Several recent newspaper reports have suggested that the US could

derive both positive and negative lessons from recent Germany

experience in managing immigration and integration. Asylum applications

fell from 438,000 in 1992 to about 130,000 in 1994, less than

the US level. The number of foreign workers arriving under at

least 5 distinct programs aimed at ensuring that such programs

add workers to the labor force but not residents to the population

is between 200,000 and 300,000. <BR>


<P>

Germany has a more generous social welfare system than the US

and, at a time of planned US cutbacks in immigrant eligibility

for welfare benefits, a review of the eligibility of foreigners

for benefits may be useful. Finally, both Germany and the US are

struggling to ensure that resident foreigners are integrated,

so a review of German definitions of integration, and integration

policies, should be illuminating.<BR>


<P>

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together 40 to 50 Washington

area immigration policy experts to review recent immigration developments

in Germany, and their implications for the current US immigration

policy debate. The morning session will review what Germany has

done to deal with asylum flows and foreign workers. Frank Loy,

President of the German Marshall Fund, will provide a comparative

perspective on immigration and integration issues at lunch. The

afternoon session will feature presentations on the access of

foreigners to tax-supported social services in Germany, and issues

surrounding the integration of foreigners.<BR>


<P>

Attendance will be limited in order to maximize opportunities

for discussion. German speakers will make 20 minute presentations,

followed by 10 minute comments by discussants, and then 45 minutes

of roundtable discussion. The major items of discussion will be

summarized in Migration News.<BR>

IMMIGRATION AND INTEGRATION CHALLENGES IN GERMANY AND THE US<BR>

<P>

Both Germany and the US include about 8 percent foreigners in

their populations, both are worried about continuing immigration

and the integration of resident foreigners, and both are searching

for durable immigration and integration policies for the 21st

century. Despite their different histories, policies, and goals,

can the two countries learn from one another how to better manage

migration and integration?<BR>

<BR>

A March 28, 1995 conference in Washington DC on immigration and

asylum challenges and choices in Germany and the US heard that

that &igrave;non-immigrant&icirc; Germany has been affected by

5 waves of immigrants over the past 50 years. There are proportionately

far more newcomers and their descendants living in Germany today

who arrived since 1950 than in the US, which means that recent

migration may have done more to reshape today&iacute;s non-immigrant

Germany than it influenced the immigrant US. <BR>

<BR>

Neither Germany nor the US is satisfied with the immigration and

integration status quo but, in both countries, there is little

agreement on answers to the three fundamental immigration questions:

how many, from where, and in what status should newcomers arrive?

Once immigrants arrive, a second set of questions arises: what

should be done to integrate them?<BR>

<BR>

Germany and the US offer an interesting comparison. Germany proclaims

that it does not wish to become a country of immigration, but

provides a relatively generous set of services to legal foreigners.

The US, by contrast, basks in its immigrant heritage, but provides

relatively few public services to help to integrate newcomers.

<BR>

<BR>

The fact that Germany provides services but not necessarily acceptance,

while Americans accept immigrants but provide them with relatively

few services, is not the only major difference. Non-immigrant

Germany is currently one of the world&iacute;s major countries

of immigration--newcomers--including foreigners, asylum seekers,

and ethnic Germans--account for 100 percent of Germany&iacute;s

population growth. In the US, by contrast, net immigration accounts

for about one-third of population growth.<BR>

<BR>

Managing migration is a tough but not impossible challenge facing

industrial societies. As numbers rise and force action, leaders

must be willing to confront the trade-offs inherent in deciding

how to manage immigration and integration.

<P>

<A NAME="_Toc321374275">German</A> Immigration <BR>


<P>

The two parts of Germany have been affected differently by migration.

The former West Germany added 13 million net immigrants between

1950 and 1993, while the former East Germany lost 5 million residents

because emigration exceeded immigration. The former West Germany

included in 1993 about 4 in 5 Germans, and virtually all of the

7 million foreigners in Germany live in the former West Germany.

<BR>

<BR>

Germany is unlikely to remain a country in which foreigners arrive

and remain foreigners. If a net 400,000 immigrants continued to

arrive annually, Germany would in 2030 have a population of about

90 million, of whom 30 percent would be foreigners. Major cities

such as Frankfurt, Stuttgart, and Munich, which are now about

one-quarter foreigners, would have populations that were half

or more foreign. Since one in six foreigners in Germany today

was born in Germany--1.2 million of 7 million--and half have lived

in Germany for 10 or more years, the status quo of foreigners

remaining foreigners is unlikely to continue. 

<P>

<A NAME="_Toc321374276">Asylum</A> <BR>


<P>

Asylum involves foreigners arriving in a country and requesting

temporary safe haven, or the chance to resettle. In all of the

industrial democracies, the majority of asylum applications are

rejected, so that separating genuine and false asylum applicants

is a major objective of all asylum systems. However it is difficult

to construct stable systems for making difficult decisions on

who really faces persecution at home, and who is seeking economic

opportunity.<BR>

<BR>

Since there are no limits on the number of asylum applicants who

can appear and request asylum, asylum has been called the &igrave;wild

card&icirc; in immigration systems. When their numbers surge,

as they did in 1992 in Germany to about 438,000, the cost of housing,

feeding, and deciding asylum cases--some DM 6 to 8 billion or

$4 to $5 billion--can equal contributions for development assistance(Germany

provided $7 billionin ODA in 1991).<BR>

<BR>

Both Germany and the US have committed themselves to the 1951

Geneva Convention, which obliges nations not to return to danger

persons fleeing political persecution. However, each nation must

decide for itself what constitutes political persecution.<BR>

<BR>

The number of asylum applicants arriving in industrial countries

rose sharply during the early 1990s, and it was widely agreed

that many of those seeking asylum did not face an individual danger

of political persecution in their country of origin. However,

revamping systems that were designed to deal with a handful of

individuals fleeing what were widely agreed to be repressive communist

regimes, led to an ongoing debate over whether priority should

go to adding resources to the current asylum system, or whether

the access of aliens to asylum should be curtailed. Germany did

both, while the US has so far primarily dealt with asylum by adding

resources in order to speed up the processing of applications.

<BR>

<BR>

In 1992-93, there were widely reported attacks on foreigners Germany

at a time when over 1000 foreigners daily were applying for asylum.

Germany added resources to speed up the processing of asylum cases,

and streamlined the system for determining whether a foreigner

was being persecuted for political reasons in his country of citizenship,

and needed the opportunity to start over in Germany. <BR>

<BR>

The debatewas contentious in part because it highlighted disagreements

over whether Germany should become a country of immigration. The

immigration issue was not resolved explicitly, but Germany did

preserve each individual&iacute;s constitutional right to have

her asylum application considered fully, but amendments prevented

aliens who could have applied for asylum in another safe country

from applying in Germany. The burden of proof was placed on applicants

from &igrave;safe countries,&icirc; and more staff were hired

to make decisions quickly, usually within 4 weeks.<BR>

<BR>

Most observers consider the asylum reform a success. The number

of asylum applicants fell by 3/4, reducing the state and local

costs of housing and feeding asylum applicants. Romanians and

Bulgarians learned that it was not worthwhile attempting to get

to Germany and apply for asylum. There does not appear to be an

offsetting increase in illegal immigration from countries that

were sending asylum seekers. <BR>

<BR>

The US during the 1980s also received an increasing number of

applications from foreigners seeking asylum, and its system for

deciding whether to grant asylum was rightly criticized for being

too influenced by political considerations. For example, in a

Latin American civil war, if the US government was supporting

the government(El Salvador), few applicants received asylum, while

most persons were recognized if they opposed governments such

as that in Nicaragua.<BR>

<BR>

In the early 1990s, the US faced a huge backlog of asylum applications--over

400,000 in 1995, representing over 700,000 individuals. The US

does not provide welfare services to asylum applicants, but until

January 1, 1995 granted work permits to asylum seekers so that

they could support themselves while their applications were pending.

<BR>

<BR>

In January 1995, the US streamlined its system and added more

staff to speed up asylum processing, in the hopes of removing

the attraction of a work permit that seemed to be attracting some

applicants. In the US today, an applicant applies to one of what

will soon be 327 asylum officers (Germany has 900), and that asylum

officer either grants asylum or refers the case to an immigration

judge--a non-INS employee. Second, asylum applicants must now

wait at least 180 days to work legally in the US.<BR>

<BR>

Most US applicants for asylum enter the country illegally, or

enter on e.g., a tourist visa, and then wait 4 to 6 months to

apply for asylum. The INS hopes to make decisions on most applications

within 6 months, so that few applicants wind up with legal permission

to work. The US is also increasing the resources committed to

removing aliens from the country--the budget has been augmented

to permit the removal of 110,000 aliens in FY96. (In Germany,

removing aliens is the responsibility of the Land or state government).

<BR>

<BR>

Both Germany and the US have invented in-between categories for

aliens who are not eligible for asylum, but who nonetheless are

not deported. The US and German acronyms--TPS, DED, &igrave;tolerated&icirc;--reflect

the expectation that these aliens will eventually depart.<BR>

<BR>

Mass asylum in industrial democracies is a 1980s-1990s phenomenon

that has been confronted with more staff to decide cases quickly,

and by restricting access to the system. How is the asylum system

likely to evolve? Some believe that the concept of safe haven

will replace resettlement. Under some notions, ALL persons requesting

asylum would be offered safe haven, perhaps on extra-territorial

islands. Then, as budgets permit, individual cases would be heard,

and those deemed in need of resettlement would be granted the

right to begin life anew.<BR>


<P>

<A NAME="_Toc321374277">Guest Workers</A> <BR>


<P>

Germany is practically synonymous with Gastarbeiter--the notion

that foreign workers can be added to the labor force without adding

long-term residents to the population. However, German and other

country experience has led to one of the few apparently universal

aphorisms in migration--there is nothing more permanent than temporary

workers.<BR>

<BR>

Germany recruited guest workers between 1961 and 1973, when their

number peaked at 2.6 million, making one in 8 workers a foreigner.

Over the next 15 years, these foreign workers united their families

in Germany, and second and third generation-foreigners joined

their parents in the German work force. <BR>

<BR>

The year 1989 ushered in a new era. The fall of the Berlin wall,

German unification, and the demise of the USSR opened heretofore

closed societies. <BR>

<BR>

Germany responded to rising immigration pressures with 5 distinct

foreign worker programs that involve some 350,000 foreigners,

and add the equivalent of about 150,000 full-time equivalent workers

to the German work force. However, unlike 1960s guest worker programs,

1990s foreign worker programs have a different purpose--to cope

with micro rather than macro labor shortages, and to make inevitable

migration legal. German foreign worker programs today also have

different incentives for the workers involved; today the emphasis

is on ensuring return to their countries of origin. <BR>

<BR>

The most important program involves project-tied workers. Under

this program, German firms sub-contract with foreign firms, and

the foreign firm supplies the expertise and workers to complete

a particular phase of a project. There were an average 40,000

project-tied foreign workers in Germany in 1994, down from 60,000

in 1992 because of scandals that involved German contractors using

project-tied agreements as a backdoor guest worker program.<BR>

<BR>

Most newly-arrived foreign workers are employed seasonally in

Germany. A peak 150,000 seasonal foreign workers in 1994 contributed

the equivalent of 40,000 FTE to the German labor force. Seasonal

foreign workers can remain 90 days in Germany, and most are employed

in agriculture, restauarnts, or construction. If the workers are

employed less than 2 months, the workers and their employers do

not have to pay social security taxes on their wages.<BR>

<BR>

The third program is for border commuters from the Czech Republic

and Poland. If local workers are not available in Germany within

50 km of these eastern borders, then employers can request permission

from the German Employment Service to employ commuter workers

at prevailing wages who can remain in Germany for up to 2 nights

weekly.<BR>

<BR>

The fourth program permits about 6000 young East Europeans to

work and learn in Germany for up to 18 months, although evaluations

indicate that Czechs, Poles, and other East Europeans learn few

skills in Germany that they use at home. Finally, about 1000 nurses

from the former Yugoslavia are allowed to work in Germany. <BR>

<BR>

In both the US and Germany, there has been a shift in the rationale

for temporary foreign worker programs. Instead of recruiting foreign

workers to deal with macro or widespread labor shortages, most

programs today are justified as a way to deal with a micro labor

shortage, or to channel into legal programs inevitable and otherwise

illegal migrants. However, most of the industrial democracies

have heeded the advice of the OECD and deregulated their labor

markets, and most today play less of a job-matching role in labor

markets--the German ES matches about 35 percent of all job seekers

and jobs, the US ES 3 to 4 percent--giving governments less credibility

when considering employer requests for foreign workers.<BR>

<BR>

Making credible determinations in micro labor markets is not the

only challenge facing governments. Governments may also have to

pay more attention to programs that admit foreigners for non-employment

reasons, but which add foreign workers to the labor force. Two

examples are foreign students(almost 500,000 in the US) and the

cultural exchange program (200,000), which adds au pair foreigners

to US households.<BR>


<P>

<A NAME="_Toc321374278">Welfare</A> <BR>


<P>

Gemini has one of the industrial world&iacute;s most comprehensive

social welfare systems, and a 3-legged system of the federal,

state, and non-profit organizations, including organizations that

represent foreigners, delivers these benefits. Foreign workers

originally did not receive many benefits, but some of those who

arrived as asylum seekers, and many older unskilled foreign workers

who lost their jobs, have become long-term welfare recipients.

Just as the US welfare system has been called by some a system

for Blacks, even though Blacks are less than 40 percent of all

cash assistance recipients, so the German welfare system may wind

up losing popular support if it appears to become a system for

foreigners.<BR>

<BR>

In the US, the effort to reduce welfare has been motivated by

the search for cost savings and by the perception that minority

immigrants are getting &igrave;too many&icirc; scarce benefits,

from affirmative action to bilingual education to cash assistance.

Illegal aliens are already barred from most US cash assistance

programs except education and emergency health care, and legislation

approved in March 1995 by the US House would remove 3/4 of the

legal aliens now receiving federal cash assistance benefits from

the rolls. Currently, 2/3 of the legal immigrants on welfare,

and 3/4 of the costs, are in CA and NY.<BR>
