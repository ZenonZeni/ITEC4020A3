<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Each year, the refining industry spends a quarter-billion dollars to produce hydrogen so that sulfur can be removed from refinery products.  This creates more than 6 million tons of hydrogen sulfide, a waste that must be treated to meet environmental regulations.  Although current waste-treatment technology recovers nearly all of the sulfur (99.0-99.5%), the remaining amount is emitted to the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide.  Moreover, the valuable hydrogen is burned to water, making it unavailable for further use.  This loss has a direct impact on bottom-line production costs for the refinery.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory-based researchers are developing a new process, called MISHA, that uses microwave plasma chemistry to split hydrogen sulfide.  This patented process recovers hydrogen and sulfur from hydrogen sulfide and recycles the hydrogen to the refinery.  MISHA (Microwave-Induced Sulfur and Hydrogen Autolysis) is an excellent fit for refineries because it would replace both the operating old Claus and tail-gas clean-up units while decreasing costly on-site hydrogen production.  In some refinery situations, MISHA can also replace the amine purification unit, thereby achieving even greater refinery savings.

<P>
Two reactor conditions must be satisfied to explain the observed hydrogen sulfide conversions and the low energy consumption:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The microwave energy must be efficiently transferred to the plasma to create a high-temperature zone (thousands of degrees).</LI>
<LI>The fluid dynamics within the plasma-chemical reactor must isolate and stabilize the plasma and, simultaneously, rapidly separate and cool the products.  This freezes the products at a composition which is characterized by the plasma temperature rather than the bulk-gas temperature.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
To satisfy these reactor conditions, the feed is injected tangentially into the reactor, above the central plasma zone.  This creates a turbulent cyclonic flow that prevents the plasma from contacting the reactor wall and minimizes energy losses.  It also creates a thin, turbulent, high-temperature layer on the surface of the plasma, where hydrogen sulfide rapidly dissociates.  The turbulence of this boundary layer ensures that the dissociation products are quenched as they remix with the bulk gas flowing around the plasma.  Furthermore, the sulfur reacts with itself to form high-molecular-weight clusters that are driven to the wall of the reactor by the centrifugal forces generated by the cyclonic flow.  This prevents sulfur from re-entering the turbulent boundary layer and back-reacting.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Argonne's experiments have confirmed the critical contribution of the cyclonic flow to increasing the hydrogen sulfide conversion and lowering its energy of dissociation.  However, the experiments challenge two of the predictions derived from a theoretical plasma-chemical model:  (1) Argonne obtained a plasma at atmospheric pressure with less than 1 kW of power, whereas the model predicted that 30 kW or more was required; and (2) the Argonne experiments do not show the predicted sharp rise in dissociation energies at pressures greater than 0.65 atm.  Furthermore, Argonne's analysis of the gas dynamics in the plasma-chemical reactor indicates that additional improvements in hydrogen sulfide conversion and process efficiency are possible.
<P>
Argonne's experiments have shown that:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>MISHA recovers both the hydrogen and the sulfur at lower costs while saving energy and oil,</LI>
<LI>MISHA's hydrogen sulfide emissions would be minuscule, less than 10 tons/yr,  for a facility recovering 158 long tons/day of sulfur and 3.9 million scf/day of hydrogen, and</LI>
<LI>In some locations, MISHA could easily be used to recover marketable hydrogen from natural gas production operations.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne is searching for an industrial partner to scale up the laboratory plasma-chemical reactor to an industrial-scale prototype reactor operating with 10-20 kW of microwave power.  This plasma reactor would provide the necessary engineering data to design a commercial process for treating hydrogen sulfide and the economic data needed to determine the commercial potential of the process.
