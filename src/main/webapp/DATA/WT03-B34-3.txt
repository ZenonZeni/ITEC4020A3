Start: Okay, okay. Lemme don my asbestos underwear and explain myself.

By:
Fred Langa

Many of you wrote to me about my October 1995 editorial discussing
the enhanced DriveSpace 3 that's part of Microsoft Plus for
Windows 95 (a.k.a. Plus Pack). Some of the calmer letters took
a decided "Are you nuts?" tone. Others were out-and-out flames
suggesting I was worse than nuts and that the only good way
to increase disk space was the good old-fashioned method of
buying more platters.

Hang up those flamethrowers! In the early days, some disk compressors
were indeed bad news. They were exotic add-ons that diddled
with your system at a very fundamental level down in the guts
of DOS, making the system do things it wasn't designed to do.
If anything went wrong, it was often catastrophic. The earliest
adopters of disk compression technology all too frequently
lost the entire contents of their hard disks.

That was then. In recent years, disk compressors have become
robust and reliable. And with Win95, Microsoft has built basic
disk compression right into the operating system. Now, you
can roughly double your effective disk space with little added
risk. (With a good backup system, which you should be using
anyway, the risk can be literally zero.)

The Plus Pack's DriveSpace 3 goes a step further than Win95's
standard compression. DriveSpace 3 is capable of standard DriveSpace
compression plus two higher levels of compacting, HiPack and
UltraPack.

HiPacked files take a bit longer to write to the disk but are
faster to read. This type of compression is ideal for .EXE, .DLL 
and similar files that are normally written once (at installation)
and then only read from the disk. With HiPack, you can save
space and time.

UltraPack squeezes files even tighter. It's best for dense archival
storage of little-used files that you still want handy. UltraPacked
files occupy minimal space but do take a bit longer both to
read and write.

Like its predecessors, DriveSpace 3 works invisibly in the background.
It's normally quite conservative: It doesn't automatically
apply the CPU-intensive highest levels of compression unless
and until you tell it to. A companion program called Compression
Agent helps that process.

Out of the box, the Compression Agent assumes any file you haven't
accessed in a month is ripe for dense archival storage, and
automatically flags those files for UltraPack compression.
(You can set the interval to be whatever you want.) You also
can specify which levels of compression (none, normal, HiPack
or UltraPack) to apply to each file, file type or directory.
When you run Compression Agent, it dutifully trundles off across
your disk, squeezing or fluffing all the files per your instructions.

It takes a while to run, so it's best done during lunch or overnight.
(See the Power Windows column in the October 1995 issue for
information on the Plus Pack's System Agent, which can automate
all kinds of tasks like this one.)

But wait, as they say, there's more. If you have a large hard
disk, compression software takes care of the associated wasted
"overhead."

If you have a 500MB hard disk, for instance, DOS (and Win95)
divides the space into 16KB clusters. This means if you save
a 1-byte file to your disk, that file still will automatically
and unavoidably consume 16,000 bytes of disk space. It's even
worse with larger hard disks. If your hard disk holds more
than about 528MB, you'll have 32KB clusters. That means saving
a measly little 1-byte file will eat 32KB of disk space-incredibly
wasteful.

Disk compression software lets you avoid much of this waste.
With DriveSpace 3, for example, a file can occupy as few as
512 bytes, so a 1-byte file wastes only 511 bytes-not 16,000
or 32,000.

This reduced overhead really adds up. DriveSpace 3 made my 1
gigabyte hard disk look like 2.76GB. Plus, it saved me well
over 300MB that would have been needlessly wasted by corpulent
clusters.

If the phrase "disk compression" has you reflexively reaching
for your flamethrower, maybe it's time for a fresh look. Whether
for the efficiency of unwasted cluster space or for elbow room
on diminutive hard disks, modern 32-bit disk compression can
be a nice addition to your system, especially now that other
vendors are starting to ship their 32-bit disk compressors.
You're not just locked into using Microsoft's solution anymore.

Now, may I please get out of this flameproof suit?

Letters: Does Microsoft Play Monopoly?



Surprisingly, many readers rushed to Microsoft's defense in
its ongoing antitrust battle with the Justice Department. Less
surprisingly, the flame war generated by our Dialog Box debate
over the Exon Amendment rages unabated.

I was intrigued by Mike Elgan's comments about whether Microsoft
has violated antitrust regulations (The Explorer, October 1995).

Microsoft has been unfairly dumped upon by the Feds. I'd love
it if someone, anyone, would stand up for those who do produce
something of value in this country, instead of knuckling under
to the same old bromides that regulation is necessary. Jason
Lockwood, via the Internet

A copy of Mike Elgan's column should be sent to the Justice
Department, since it is obvious that Mike has a better grasp
on computer-related antitrust issues than Washington does.

Craig Bonvechio

via the Internet

Mike Elgan says Microsoft's OS dominance has no effect on its
applications success. In fact, he called this idea "hogwash."
Well, his dismissal of this idea is "balderdash." Consider
the number of neophyte computer users who see "Microsoft" all
over their OS documentation and on their startup screens and
think that a Microsoft product is more suitable for use with
the OS because the name matches.

Microsoft makes good applications. However, there are many behaviors
that smack of anticompetitiveness and monopolism. The proper
thing is for Microsoft to avoid even a hint of impropriety.

Rob Stewart

via the Internet

In a world where successful people and businesses are routinely
despised because of their success, I found Mike Elgan's piece
on Microsoft refreshing. The hurdle of overcoming all this
resentment is plenty of challenge for any company; federally
imposed legal hurdles are simply not necessary.

Letters: Designer Windows



I very much enjoyed Mark Hebert's article about being a closet
Windows graphic designer (Dialog Box, November 1995). I have
been designing on a PC since PageMaker made its first version
for the PC. I struggled with cross-platform compatibility issues
and the smug looks from the Mac users, but now I'm glad I have
PC experience. PC graphic artists may have the last laugh after
all.

Robert O. Allan

via the Internet

I appreciated Mark Hebert's column.

I have been a graphic designer/desktop publisher/interactive
multimedia title developer for seven years now all on Windows.
I don't have to convert a company's corporate data into a format
a Mac can read before using it (saves lots of time and money
for everyone); I can give it back to a client in a form that
can be further manipulated by the company; I can charge less
because of the lower overhead; I can offer much more flexibility;
and I can match or better their output.

Karen DeFelice

via the Internet

Pioneers like Mark Hebert and I will get the word out to our
peers. With software differences being nil, pricing favoring
the Windows platform and operating speeds being arguably better,
the days of Mac systems dominating the graphics arena are numbered.
When you cut right to it, clients don't care how their collateral
is created, only that it sells product.

Letters: The Exon Word Spill



Sen. Jim Exon's column (Dialog Box, October 1995) was hardly
worth the space. We've heard all this poppycock before. The
only part of it that aroused me was that I don't like being
referred to as part of the "hands-off elite." The elite are
in Washington. Out here in the hinterlands, we're just simple,
practical people who are tired of self-serving politicians
who use "for the good of our children" to justify every petty
little regulatory urge they choose to pursue.

Gene Warner

via the Internet

Sen. Jim Exon said some groups will do anything to defend the
status quo on the Internet. He's right. The Internet is the
First Amendment come to life. Let us keep it that way!

Gabor Morocz

via the Internet

I do agree with Sen. Exon that there's a lot of material on
the Internet that's inappropriate for children. Perhaps online
services should limit access to adults only. We don't let children
drive on our interstate highways. Why do they need to be driving
on our Internet highways?

Robert A. Swirsky

via the Internet

It is sad to see the ignorance that Sen. Exon voices. How can
you legislate a network that goes beyond national boundaries?
Don't spend my tax dollars having the government do a parent's
job.

Yes, pornography is evil. But censorship is more evil.

Letters: Long Live the Floppy



While I agree with Fred Davis (ReadMe File, November 1995) that
the floppy drive has not seen any improvement in quite some
time, I cannot see CD-R as the answer to the floppy disk's
obsolescence. The floppy disk is inherently reusable, is much
more environmentally friendly, is easy to use and has a proven
track record. The CD-R is like all CD-ROM systems: temperamental,
not reusable, easily dirtied and hard to read by the system.

Ken Adamek

via America Online

Your article "It's time to deep-six the now-obsolete floppy
disk drive" was one of the dumbest things I've ever read. Did
you ever notice the price of a CD-R?

Letters: This Headline..er, Stinks



I have come to expect thorough reporting, informative articles
and thought-provoking commentary when I read WINDOWS Magazine.
I was disappointed with the thoughtless and less-than-professional
"attention-grabber" to lead off the Fred Davis column ("Here's
what's really good about Windows 95: It sucks less!" ReadMe
File, October 1995). While the words used may be common nowadays
in some circles, in my opinion they reflect a decided lack
of professionalism and do not belong in your otherwise fine
magazine.

Letters: A Key Concern



I'm responding to your recent article "Key to Making Changes"
(News, October 1995). I have encountered many keyboard arrangements
over the years. Each has its pluses and minuses, but the two
biggest overall minuses are the varied placement of the "nontypewriter"
keys (especially the backslash and backspace keys) and the
offset of the "typewriter" keys to the left. The auto manufacturers
have moved many controls to the steering wheel, and it seems
logical for the computer industry to do the same with keyboards.

Newstrends: DirectX APIs Mean Business

By:
Jim Forbes

Sometime in the (near) future, even novices will be able to
create presentations that involve highly complex three-dimensional
graphics. The reason: Microsoft has been playing games with
Windows 95.

While most of the attention devoted to the still-new operating
system has focused on its business applications, a few people
like Micro-soft game developer Alex St. John-worked on software
code that controls the display of graphics, creates novel ways
for programs to use sound and video, and builds support within
applications for 3-D graphics.

These snippets of code are collectively called the DirectX APIs.
Microsoft was supposed to ship them with Win-dows 95, but they
arrived a couple of months later. Developed to make Win95 a
better games platform, the new APIs speed graphics by up to
25 percent, according to Eric Engstrom, a software development
manager with Microsoft.

Software analysts stress that there is a link between games,
which run best on high-performance systems, and business applications.
The DirectX APIs, said Dan Lavin, an analyst with research
firm Dataquest, "could provide a significant advantage for
business software developers."

Direct3D, one of the most important APIs, has yet to ship. Deve
loped by Microsoft after its acquisition of the graphics firm
Render-morphics, Direct3D allows developers to quickly create
rendered animation segments. Companies such as LucasArts, Activision
and Papyrus say they will use the new API, which adds less
than 300KB to the size of a program.

Microsoft is certainly looking forward to some big business
with the emphasis on business-with the new APIs. Said St. John,
"We think of the DirectX APIs as being the genie we just let
out of the bottle."

Newstrends: Another Crack at the Hand-Held Market

By:
Jim Forbes

It may be d j vu all over again, but the names are different.
The new OmniGo 100 personal organizer is from Hewlett-Packard,
and it runs on GEOS from Geoworks.

Only a couple of years ago, conventional wisdom had it that
Compaq should attack the "companion" market-very portable machines
that retain the look and feel of a desktop PC-with products
that ran Microsoft's WinPad. But HP, which has built a reputation
for notebooks and palmtops, thinks it's found a better path
to Windows applications-without Microsoft.

While the OmniGo is a far cry from the products touted by Compaq
and Microsoft, it is a true second-generation hand-held that
lets users exchange data with PCs running Windows.

Ironically, HP was to have been among the first manufacturers
to use the ill-fated WinPad OS. But the company actually balked
at the price long before Microsoft itself abandoned its Win
Pad plans. The decision appears to have paid off; the OmniGo
is a good 300 percent less costly than what Compaq had proposed.

Newstrends: Micro Multimedia

By:
Jim Forbes

Multimedia is big-so big, in fact, that you can soon expect
to see chip manufacturers deliver new CPUs designed specifically
for multimedia applications.

First, Intel has the P55C (Newstrends, October 1995). The company
will only confirm that it's an enhanced Pentium processor with
multimedia code extensions, and delivery is set for the second
quarter of this year.

Cyrix is taking a more aggressive approach with a preliminary
demonstration of its technology, a prototype part called the
5GX86. It includes an on-chip graphics accelerator and other
integrated functions that could make it attractive to cost
conscious OEMs.

Finally, AMD may also get in the hunt by including multimedia
microcode in its new Am5x86.

Virtually all these products are aimed at the SOHO market-which
is very big. Worldwide sales of notebooks and desktops now
exceed 4.5 million units per month, and nearly 40 percent are
multimedia-capable.

But it's a market that cares as much about price as performance.
And Cyrix's price tags have already drawn AST and Epson, which
signed on for its 5X86 and 6X86 (or M1) series. In short, the
chip wars could soon get even more heated.

Newstrends: A CD-R In Every Home?

By:
Dave Raffo

Every computing product has a magic price barrier that it needs
to crack if it wants to entice the mainstream user. For CD
recorders, analysts said that magic number was $500-half the
average price.

Enter Panasonic's PowerDrive2, which now costs $499.95. "Basically,
we decided to get out of the niche market and attack the mass
market," said Rich Harada, marketing manager for optical products.
And if other vendors follow Panasonic's lead-they may have
no choice-CD-Rs may yet catch on at home.

The PowerDrive2 is a removable, rewritable 650MB phase-change
optical disk and quad-speed CD-ROM drive. Consumers liked it,
says Panasonic, but not the $895 price tag. Maybe now they
will.

Newstrends: And Now, It's the Virtual Teller

By:
James E. Powell

Even as the Internet becomes an increasingly popular medium
for providing company information or technical support-or just
whiling away the time-consumer acceptance of online services
remains quite low. That's a challenge to firms like Intuit,
whose future rests with online offerings such as home banking.

Intuit's Quicken for 96 takes a big step toward getting customers
to experiment with online services. The financial management
software includes a custom graphical World Wide Web browser
to cruise Intuit's home pages, which include personal finance
tips, details about online offerings from banks and order forms
for Intuit software. Company sources say the sites could eventually
provide stock quotes and other financial data. There are no
plans-yet-to conduct financial transactions via the service,
but given partner Netscape's intense interest in secure online
commerce, such features will probably become available in early
1996.

The browser is a modified version of Netscape-the most popular
Web cruiser now available-that permits customers to visit only
the sites Intuit selects. Customers wanting to upgrade to a
full Internet browser, meanwhile, can call another Intuit partner,
Concentric Communications, which is offering an hour of online
time for $1.95 per month or seven hours for $9.95. That's the
lowest-cost plan yet available from Internet service providers.

One Click Away

The installed base of modems is growing, thanks to their inclusion
as standard equipment on new PCs, and easy one-click access
to the Internet should help Quicken's 8 million users. The
company decided to form an alliance with an Internet provider
because Web pages can be changed quickly to respond to the
ever-shifting nature of financial data.

Users of Intuit's chief competitor, Microsoft Money, also have
access to the Net via the Microsoft Network. However, they
must already be members of MSN, which comes at a price; Intuit's
offering is free.

Newstrends: Inside the Corporate Web

By:
Jim Forbes

Never mind "World Wide"; one of the more interesting aspects
about the Web is the growing number of private home pages,
with access limited to employees of a specific corporation.

"Corporate home pages are an important tool for enhancing internal
communications in workgroups and [extended] settings," said
Ed Hott, vice president of Internet provider Inters in Sunnyvale,
Calif. In fact, Internet consultants report that corporate
interest in the World Wide Web-which, unlike the rest of the
Internet, abounds in graphics, sound, hypertext links and other
multimedia elements-as an internal communications medium is
at an all-time high, and getting higher.

Oil giant Chevron is among the companies using the so-called
Intranet to disseminate information and make software updates
available to its 42,000 employees. This has also sparked interest
among staffers who want to publish technical and other newsletters.
"There is tremendous potential in private Web pages that are
adapted to collect information or that serve as two-way interactive
links to network-enabled applications," said Kirk Trambel,
an analyst with Chevron.

This trend has great implications. For example, if the Web becomes
a true medium of collaborative computing in the corporate world,
it could hurt Notes, the groupware product that induced IBM
to buy Lotus. Moreover, several vendors are scrambling to help
corporations do what they need to do on the Web. Borland, Oracle,
Microsoft and Netscape are among those aiming products at this
market. And while Netscape gets most of the press, analysts
point to Microsoft's forthcoming Blackbird, which helps corporate
and third-party developers build networked, Web-based apps,
as a product that could fit the bill.

Newstrends: A Taxing Situation

By:
Eileen McCooey

When the holidays are in full swing ... can tax season be far
behind?

Some of those who turned to tax software last year may have
not-so-fond memories of unhappy returns. Several products had
bugs, and vendors scrambled to issue mea culpas and fixes.
This year, they're determined to avoid a sequel.

For example, Intuit, publisher of TurboTax, has doubled its
testing but is ready to cope with problems. "We have an infrastructure
in place that would enable us to ship hundreds of thousands
of [fixes] immediately," reported Guy MacNeill, group product
manager for tax software. And most vendors are setting up online
forums, bulletin boards, fax-back programs and free support.

The bottom line: Makers of tax software can't afford not to
take such steps. "At current price points [typically $20 to
$40], vendors can't afford to release maintenance versions,"
said Lance Dunn, director of software development for Parsons,
which publishes Personal Tax Edge.

Vendors have enhanced the '95 tax year versions with a wealth
of advice. TurboTax, for example, has over 100 video clips
with pointers from tax experts. Kiplinger's Tax-Cut and Per
sonal Tax Edge also use multimedia to counsel users on tax
saving strategies. Most programs now offer context-sensitive
advice and make it easier to import data from personal-finance
programs.

Recap



Microsoft announced that through a combination of upgrades and
the shipment of preloaded PCs, sales of Windows 95 officially
passed the 7 million mark less than two months after Win95's
release. o Lotus put its IBM-enhanced weight behind Notes Release
4.0, the integrated messaging and groupware package. The pre
release version was sent to 10,000 Lotus Business Partners
and other customers. At press time, the company said the product
would ship before the end of 1995. o Microsoft released updated
drivers to deal with a potential security problem in Windows
95. Some end users had found that after a remote administrator
logs off a system, other network users have read-only access
until that system is restarted. Only NetWare users who have
enabled File and Print Sharing along with Remote Administration
are at risk. o Netscape announced Power Pack 1.0, a suite of
add-on applications that extends the capabilities of Netscape
Navigator for Windows. Combining Netscape SmartMarks, Chat
and multimedia add-on applications from Adobe and Apple, among
others, the product lets customers take advantage of five add
on apps. o According to a survey conducted by leading OEM Packard
Bell, almost 25 percent of PC households already have more
than one home computer, and another 14 percent plan to buy
another. o Corbis, the digital media company owned by Bill
Gates, first acquired the entire Bettman Archive, one of the
world's largest photo collections, then reached an agreement
to distribute images owned by The State Hermitage Museum in
St. Petersburg, Russia, which has one of the world's largest
art collections. o Digital Equipment released FX!32, software
translation technology that allows Windows 95 applications
written for Intel-based machines to run on Digital's Alpha
chips.

Newstrends: Smart Warning



Quantum and Symantec's Norton Smart Doctor for Windows 95, an
application that warns PC users of impending device failures,
is among some 35 products being developed by various vendors
to support the SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology) System industry standard for hardware devices.
Launched last summer, the SMART System calls for disk-

drive monitoring by the drive as well as the host computer,
plus a graphical user interface designed to alert the user
when a device is about to fail.

Newstrends: No Applications Here



To no one's surprise, Novell decided to put WordPerfect, its
umbrella applications business, up for sale. The decision came
not too long after the company decided to abandon its UNIX
business. After struggling to make itself a player in the applications
arena-WordPerfect's word processing software steadily lost
ground to Microsoft Word, while its office suite barely got
off the ground-Novell announced plans to focus on doing what
it does best: networking.

Newstrends: Money: Good News and Bad



According to Microsoft, nearly 450,000 people took advantage
of the company's offer for a free download of Money, its personal
finance product and rival to market leader Quicken. However,
the rollout was marred by what the company called a "minor
problem" with the online bill-payment feature. The company
hastily sent out a fix that was also posted on Microsoft's
Web site.

Newstrends: Alliances Online



Online service provider CompuServe struck several strategic
alliances. The company joined forces with Premiere Communications
to launch the CallingAll Card, which looks like a phone card
but actually gives members a "virtual office" that includes
fax mail, voice mail, speed dial, conference calling, travel
services, and up-to-the-minute reports on news, weather and
sports. CompuServe also announced plans for a service that
enables users to view multimedia clips online without having
to download playback software and multimedia files. It's the
goal of a deal with Macromedia that will bring the firm's Director
Player technology to the online environment.

Technology Watch: And the Oscar Goes to ... Trinity

By:
Jim Forbes

Don't look now, but the next big thing in Windows computing
could be seen on a really big screen. Some of the brains behind
the mid-1980s product Video Toaster are working on a new device
that, despite its vaporware status, has already been pitched
by Intel's CEO Andrew Grove to Steven Spielberg.

Trinity, from a company called Play, is a standalone box that
connects to Pentium PCs running Win95 or Windows NT via a PCI
card. In ess-ence, Trinity, which starts at about $6,000, allows
video professionals to turn their computers in-to digital editing
stations. Like Video Toaster, which worked with Commodore's
Amiga, Trinity allows videographers to edit and add a variety
of complex special effects to digital video images. It can
accept up to 29 expansion cards.

Trinity has several features that previously required rack-mounted
solutions. For example, it supports 10-input digital switching,
chroma keying, and the addition, creation and manipulation
of color special effects. It includes a timeline editor, audio
mixing and ultra-high-speed (10-nanosecond) character generation.
The system also supports a 330Mb-per-second proprietary networking
solution that allows users to interconnect PCs in production
environments.

Play is bootstrapping its growth from an existing product, Snappy.
And though officials say they won't develop one- or two-card
versions for the low end, next-generation versions of Snappy
will support some of the effects generated by Trinity.

Technology Watch: Acrobat: Gunning for HTML

By:
James Alan Miller

Acrobat, Adobe's electronic publishing tool, has been slow to
find a niche. But its recent integration into browsers could
signal a major change.

Acrobat allows a document to retain its look without requiring
the user to have the application used to create it. And because
Acrobat has given documents an elegant look and feel, Adobe
hopes it will overtake HTML.

Netscape is now developing a plug-in architecture for its next
generation browser. This will allow a future version of Acrobat,
expected this year, to render PDF files (Acrobat's file format)
in Netscape itself. Look for Acrobat to appear in several upcoming
online packages, including AT&T's Internet service and Microsoft's
Black-bird browser.

Technology Watch: Dialing Up Savings

By:
Ian Etra

Remember VocalTec? The firm sparked interest when it introduced
the Internet Phone, a software package for voice communications
in real time between two PCs on the Internet. The idea had
a simple premise: Linking the PC and the phone via the Net
could lead to big savings.

Now some other companies are targeting the same goal. Quarter
deck recently rolled out WebTalk, which provides full duplex
phone capabilities over the Net. WebTalk can also be used on
one PC to broadcast to multiple PCs running the program, and
is bundled with the Mosaic browser. Quarterdeck believes WebTalk
could become effective in collaborative computing.

Coming from a different angle, IDT, a provider of Internet access
and international callback services, allows a user to initiate
a phone call via the Net. The "call" is placed through a switch
that handles communications routing. In its rollout period,
the service will be available only for dialing into the U.S.
and the U.K.

Notes From The Lab: From Winmag Central -- We Could Use a Utility



Okay, you caught us, and now we have to don the dunce cap. The
Windows 95 upgrade guide feature in our November 1995 issue
mentioned that Norton Desktop contains a utility to convert .QAG 
files back to Windows .GRP files. No such luck. Let's
face it-we were staring out at the playground instead of paying
attention in class. Maybe someone (hello, utility programmers!)
will come up with a solution.

The arrival of the first 120MHz notebooks bodes well for power
portable lovers. A quick look at the Gateway 2000 Solo ($5,999),
complete with 1GB hard drive and impressive Wintune scores
200 MIPS, 67 MFLOPS and more than 13MB-per-second disk transfer
triggered a Pavlovian response among the WinLab rats. Stay
tuned to upcoming WinLab reviews for a look at the new performance
standard in notebooks, which are still evolving.

That buzz you're hearing might not be feedback from your speakers,
but bugs being ferreted out of Win95. Microsoft recently posted
a fix on its online forums to address a problem with linking
cells to multiple worksheets ... Maybe Office95 should have
included a flyswatter.

For those not yet connected to the Internet (Hello, McFly! Rejoin
the 20th century!), here's a way the plain old telephone can
help answer your Win95 questions. A Fast Tips for Windows 95
number (800-936-4200) has been set up to answer frequently
asked questions and provide special-announcements information
on the Microsoft support network, plus other important facts.

Notes From The Lab: Netwotking Nuggets



Here are a couple of tricks for networking types courtesy of
Mark Frale, WinMag's Network Administrator (with an assist
from Microsoft). To add long filename support to a NetWare
3.11 server, you must load a patch from Novell, available online
at ftp.novell.com/pub/netware/nwos/nw311/osnlm. Run the file
311PTD.EXE to extract the file OS2OPNFX.NLM. To see the long
filenames, Windows 95 machines must add a value to the Registry
in the HKey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Nwredir\
section-add a SupportLFN key value and insert a line with a
binary value of 2.

Network administrators also can receive NetWare messages in
a flash by running Windows 95-and best of all, it's absolutely
free! Run WINPOPUP.EXE (conveniently located in your WINDOWS
directory) minimized to stay one step ahead of trouble. You
can also use WINPOPUP to chat with others instantly if you
can't wait for an e-mail response.

Notes From The Lab: Update -- Monitoring Cuts



Sampo has dropped below the 1K barrier, but we're talking low
priced monitors, not low memory. The AlphaScan GLX-KDM-2077E
20-inch monitor (WinLab Product Comparisons, February 1995)
lists for $995 and is the first large-format display we've
seen at this price threshold.

Texas Instruments' notebook prices are also taking a downward
spiral. The TravelMate 5000 line (WinLab First Impressions,
September 1995) now starts at $2,999 for a 75MHz Pentium model
and tops out at $4,799 for a P90.

The teeny-tiny Datasonix Pereos storage cartridge ("Hardware
Heaven," June 20, 1995) now boasts an equally small price.
The 1.25GB unit is now $499, down from $649.

Notes From The Lab: Heads Up



Bully for our alert readers! Craig Bull of the University of
Dayton submitted this tip in response to the problems with
Zoom modems (November 1995). If your modem won't dial out because
your phone service beeps to indicate that you have a message,
don't panic. You can issue the command "ATX3" to instruct your
modem to dial even if it doesn't detect a tone-or better yet,
include this command as part of your initialization string.

Like everyone else, we ran for Office-95 because of the promises
including long filename support. But our first response was
to vote against the way files are saved in Word95-that is,
with a .DOC extension. That happens even when you try to customize
the extension (e.g., FEATURE.JAN becomes FEATURE.JAN.DOC). 
To get around this naming convention, you only need
a good quote-okay, two quotes: Surround your document name
with quotation marks ("FEATURE.JAN")

Jim Powell, our man in Seattle, recently received an Acer Aspire
133MHz desktop that has a dramatic new look, including a curved
dark-green system and a monitor with Swiss-cheese holes on
top. Alas, it had so many problems we couldn't do a full review.
The disk-drive door fell off, the cover wouldn't go back on
properly, and there was a loose part rattling around somewhere
that must have come free during shipment. We called Acer, and
the company plans to redesign the case for systems shipping
in the spring.

WinTips: Win95 Tips of the Month


 
Eject! Eject!

Right-click on the CD-ROM icon in My Computer and select Eject
from the Context menu to eject the CD from the drive.

Write Makes Right

The Win95 installation wipes out Windows Write and associates
your .WRI files with the new WordPad. If you want to keep Write,
copy WRITE.EXE and WRITE.HLP to a diskette before you install
Win95.

Space: The Final Frontier

Find out where all the drive space is: Open My Computer, select
all or some of the drives in the folder, right-click on any
of the drives and select Properties from the Context menu.
You'll get a tabbed dialog containing available-space information
on each of the selected drives.

-Dave Caracappa via the Internet

Switch to Setup Switches

By adding switches to the Setup command, you can control what
the Win95 Setup utility does. To find out what those switches
are, just type SETUP /? at the command prompt.

When 'Up' Brings You Down

If you navigate the Start menu with arrow keys, you know that
items on the top of cascading menus are selected until you
press the down arrow to select items below. To get to the bottom
of a long menu, press the up arrow key. When the top menu item
is selected, pressing the up arrow key brings you to the bottom.

No More Longing for Long Filenames

Get in the habit of using long filenames! Suggestion: Flag files
you

don't use but don't want to delete either. If you're going to
make a backup file, remember that you can add a "second extension."
For example, instead of renaming the AUTOEXEC.BAT file AUTOEXEC.BAK,
rename it "AUTOEXEC.BAT.backup created on January 13 1996."

Bill Davis

via CompuServe

Disable AutoRun

AutoRun plays CDs as soon as you put them in the drive. If you
don't like this feature, you can turn it off. Right-click on
My Computer and select the Device Manager tab. Find your CD
ROM drive on the list, then double-click on it. Select the
Settings tab and deselect Auto Insert Notification.

Tell DOS Who's Boss

Batch files in Win95 leave a telltale DOS residue-the open MS
DOS Prompt window. To close it, create a shortcut to the batch
file, right-click on the shortcut to bring up the Properties
dialog, select the Program tab and click on the Close on Exit
item at the bottom.

DriveSpace Isn't Just for Hard Disks

Use DriveSpace for diskettes! Just remember that if you need
to format them in the future, you must do so from the DriveSpace
utility.

Launch Folders At Startup

You already know you can put programs and documents in your
StartUp folder to launch things at Win95 startup, but you can
also put folders in there. Just follow the normal procedure
 Right-click on the Start button and select Open, double-click
on the Programs folder, then the StartUp folder. Now drag the
folder of your choice into the StartUp window.

The End Is Near

If you've got a folder window open and want to get to the bottom
of it, don't use the scroll bar. Just press Ctrl+End.

A Smart Restart

Sometimes you need to restart Windows to make a settings change
take effect. But there's a faster way. Select Shut Down from
the Start menu, then press and hold the Shift key when you
click on Restart the Computer, then (still holding down the
Shift key) click OK. When the screen prompt reads, "Windows
is now restarting," you can let go of the Shift key. Performing
this action bypasses the boot sequence.

It's a Cool Feature, Period!

You DOS veterans know that typing two periods after the Change
Directory command (CD ..) brings you to the parent directory
of the current directory. The Win95 MS-DOS prompt improves
on this by the use of three periods and four periods to bring
you to the parent directories once and twice removed, respectively.

Explorer: Why are mighty banks afraid of little software companies?

By:
Mike Elgan

This year, banks and software vendors will wage a bloody war
over the future of banking. Even international financial behemoths
are scared to death of the comparatively small Intuit and Microsoft.
The two companies have been jockeying for control over online
banking standards ever since the U.S. Justice Department derailed
their merger.

You may scratch your head at my characterization of Microsoft
as a "little software company." But compare Bank of America's
assets of $228 billion and 97,500 employees to Microsoft's
less than $10 billion in assets and 18,000 employees-they're
in different leagues.

The notion of a couple of software makers scaring banks with
cheap consumer products like Quicken and Money may seem absurd.
Fewer than 10 million people use personal finance applications,
and only 400,000 to 700,000 use PCs to bank online.

But although most Americans still bank the old-fashioned way,
a widespread infrastructure for a fully digital banking future
is forming behind the scenes at a breakneck pace. The American
Bankers Association predicts the number of medium to large
banks (with assets of $1 billion or more) offering PC-based
transactions will nearly quadruple this year, from 11 percent
to 42 percent. Not surprisingly, huge advertising campaigns
are in the works that will introduce millions of Americans
to the wonders of online banking.

The appeal of online banking

Online banking makes current statements available to you 24
hours a day, and lets you pay bills with the click of a mouse.
Bill-paying transactions are simple transfers from your account
to the payee's. If the receiver can't accept electronic transfers,
the service prints a check and mails it.

Much of the bill-paying is automatic: The software reminds you
what bills are due when. No more writing checks or balancing
your checkbook. No more licking stamps or shuffling off to
the branch office. And it's cheap: about $10 a month or less.
Savings in stamps and envelopes alone pay for the cost of service
for most families.

Personal finance applications that support online banking, such
as Quicken, Money and Meca's Managing Your Money, not only
facilitate transactions but also keep track of them. They show
exactly where your money goes by letting you slice and dice
the data as you can with a spreadsheet. Some services even
help you invest online-buying and selling stocks, monitoring
your portfolio and conducting research to stay on top of the
market.

Why banks are scared

As the number of online transactions soars, banking steadily
migrates into the familiar turf of software developers. The
banks realize how little they know about this business, and
that's why they're scared.

Banks win customers by creating a perception of security, stability
and solvency. This perception is based on images of big, indestructible
vaults (as if the banks keep all the money in there), towering
pillars and solid names built around words like National, America
and First. Customer loyalty is based on the psychology of trust.

Software companies are out to change all that. They want us
to view banking as just another form of information processing,
and money as just another form of information. They want to
transfer customer loyalty from the trusted bank to the preferred
software application. Financial institutions would become low
margin, invisible providers of services whose main feature
is low cost.

As in the applications software market, the one who controls
the standards of online banking wins. That's why Microsoft,
Intuit, a host of technology companies and banks are scrambling
to own the standards, and thus the future, of online banking.

Reacting out of concern that borders on panic, banks are doing
everything from giving away copies of Quicken and Money to
buying software companies to launching online services. But
banks don't know how to compete in this new environment. That's
why they're hitching their wagons to software and technology
partners as fast as they can.

Bank of America and NationsBank bought MECA, which will offer
Manage Your Money to bank customers and continue to sell it
in retail stores. Digicash, Open Market, Block Financial Software,
4Home Productions and Netscape offer different software front
ends to banking services.

A 21-member consortium of American banks and technology companies
is working on an initiative called the Electronic Check Project
to make Internet-based checking available within two years.

That opens up the whole issue of security. Software vendors
are responding to users' concerns by developing ways to protect
online transactions. CheckFree Corp.-which provides the secure
bill-paying back-end services for Quicken, CompuServe and Prodigy
is offering a new product called CheckFree Wallet that enables
secure credit-card transactions over the Web.

In September, Microsoft and new partner Visa announced their
own means of enabling secure online credit-card transactions,
Secure Transaction Technology (STT)

Netscape, MasterCard, IBM, Digital, CyberCash and GTE cried
foul at the announcement. Complaining the standard wasn't open
to competitors, they urged companies to support their acronym
 SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

A two-horse race?

Despite all this competition, Microsoft and Intuit remain in
the best position to control the future of online banking.

Though Microsoft dominates most of the software categories it
enters, here it's playing the ill-fitting role of David taking
on the online Goliath Intuit. There are more than 8 million
Quicken users out there-many of them fanatics-versus fewer
than 2 million Money users, despite a 450,000-unit giveaway
of the Win95 version that expired last October.

Quicken 5 tends to get better reviews than Money for Windows
95. It's more powerful and offers more services for investors.
The current version runs on both Windows 3.x and Win95; the
current version of Money runs only on Win95. Each company has
relationships with more than 20 major financial institutions.

Given Intuit's dominance, why is Microsoft even considered a
contender? Because Microsoft is brimming with both vision and
cash. Microsoft is in the unique position of owning an operating
system (the operating system, really), an online service, a
personal finance application, a huge Internet presence and
a few billion in cash. Oh, and the company never gives up on
what it considers a good idea.

So, Intuit and Microsoft are the favorites in the online banking
race. You get to decide who wins when you go to your local
computer superstore and buy cheap shrink-wrapped personal finance
software.

No wonder banks are scared!

ReadMe File: Coming Soon to a computer screen near you: MPEG

By:
Fred Davis

The latest ladle of acronym soup being served up to Windows
users is MPEG-which stands for Motion Pictures Experts Group.
MPEG is a standards committee composed of people from the motion
picture industry and the high-tech world who got together a
few years ago to develop a standard for compressing full-motion
video for digital playback. That committee's work resulted
in the MPEG standard, which has been around for a few years
but has suddenly gotten a giant boost, thanks to-you guessed
it-Microsoft.

Microsoft took a well-deserved drubbing for its anemic Video
for Windows in Windows 3.1. With VFW 3.1, you could watch a
jerky, postage-stamp-sized movie on your computer screen in
what seemed like a pathetic imitation of Apple Computer's QuickTime.
Because Microsoft wanted to make multimedia a Windows 95 cornerstone,
it launched a vigorous campaign to promote MPEG as a primary
video standard for Win95. The centerpiece of Microsoft's strategy
is MPEG for Windows 95, a special software driver that Microsoft
licensed from MediaMatics, a small MPEG developer. Although
Microsoft couldn't include this in its initial Win95 version,
the company is making it available to developers for incorporation
into their products and will release it as a free add-on to
both Win95 and Windows NT.

MPEG is a system for both encoding and decoding full-motion
video, like movies or video clips. Software developers use
special encoder hardware in the thousand-dollar-and-up category,
such as the RealMagic Producer add-in card from Sigma Designs,
which takes output and compresses it into the MPEG file format.
To view an MPEG movie, you need an MPEG decoder, which can
be hardware, software or a combination of both. Sigma Design's
RealMagic card, which worked in conjunction with your computer's
video card, was the first marketed product that allowed PC
users to take advantage of MPEG. In addition, more than 60
other MPEG playback cards from a host of manufacturers are
now available. These cards generally sell in the $100 to $300
range.

MPEG for Windows 95 enables a Pentium-class system to play MPEG
encoded videos without any additional hardware. Microsoft has
pitched MPEG for Windows 95 as part of the newly announced
Multimedia PC 3, or MPC 3 specification for multimedia computers.
The MPC 3 spec calls for a system with a minimum of a 75MHz
Pentium processor, 8MB of RAM, wavetable audio and a quad-speed
CD-ROM drive. This specification is expected to be widely supported
by hardware and software vendors as a minimum target for the
next generation of entertainment and gaming software. Like
most Microsoft products, MPEG for Windows 95 doesn't run well
on the minimum configuration; in fact, you really need a 90MHz
Pentium just to get so-so performance.

Normal videos display about 30 frames per second (fps) to fool
your eye into seeing smooth, seamless motion. MPEG for Windows
95 running on a 90MHz Pentium will only play around 24fps,
so the image will not appear quite as smooth as it should.
In addition, MPEG for Windows 95 produces neither good sound
nor accurate colors. The color problem also affects resolution,
so that images appear chunky and splotchy. Why such poor video
quality? To explain, I'll need to tell you a few technical
details.

The type of MPEG used on PCs is called MPEG I, which specifies
a 352x240-pixel output resolution. Since this is less than
a third the size of your PC's screen, most MPEG decoders expand
the image to fill the entire screen using a technique called
upsampling. When the MPEG decoder upsamples an image, it replicates
pixels to achieve the larger size. The exact technique used
to replicate the pixels makes a real difference in the video
quality. A simple decoder makes a straightforward replication,
resulting in the worst quality. The better decoders use fancier
tricks, such as interpolating the pixels and smoothing algorithms.

Microsoft's MPEG for Windows 95 employs one of the worst MPEG
decoders I've ever seen. My suspicion is that MPEG for Windows
95 is really just a come-on for buying dedicated MPEG hardware,
either on a separate card or as part of a new video card. After
seeing some MPEG clips using MPEG for Windows 95, you'll be
excited by the prospects of MPEG, but frustrated by the performance
of the software-only approach.

This scenario fits in well with Microsoft's apparent overall
strategy of making Win95 the decade's hardware upgrade engine.
If you do get suckered into springing for dedicated MPEG hardware,
at least you'll find a dramatic performance turnaround. The
software-only MPEG for Windows 95 plays the MPEG video at 24fps,
with AM-radio-quality audio, and sucks up just about all the
processing power of a 90 or 100MHz Pentium. But if you add
a dedicated MPEG decoder chip to lend the CPU a helping hand,
you can play back a full 30fps video with CD-quality audio,
placing only a 10 percent load on the rest of your system.
A good hardware decoder also makes a full-screen image appear
sharper because it uses fancy tricks to smooth out the pixels
when it replicates them.

MPEG will become a major buzzword this year. You'll see it all
over ads for most systems. But buyer beware! As I hope you've
learned from this column, not all MPEG is created equal. For
example, Packard Bell currently offers the software-only version
on its systems, so you'll be watching some pretty murky movies.
IBM is shipping MPEG on all its new Aptiva systems and uses
a hybrid hardware/software approach that decodes the video
using the system's Pentium, but decodes the audio using IBM's
Mwave audio card. This intermediary approach provides better
quality than going software-only, but still saps most of your
system's horsepower. Compaq is taking the high road on some
of its Presario systems by offering a full hardware MPEG decoder,
which provides good quality video while minimizing the impact
on system performance.

Because hardware MPEG decoders are the better way to go, the
heated competition in the PC marketplace will drive this approach
to the forefront. The next crop of PC video cards will offer
MPEG as a standard feature, and pretty soon we'll see MPEG
chips migrating to the motherboard. By 1997, just when MPEG
I will seem like a stable standard, kaboom! It will be blown
away by MPEG II, offering four times the resolution. MPEG II
looks better than a TV screen.

Windows at Work: Quit smoking. Lose weight. Give to charity. Sound familiar?

By:
Cheryl Currid

It's January-time to start making good on those New Year's resolutions.
It's also time for my annual plea to encourage you to work
smart. If you work smart, you'll have more time to work out
and follow through on a few of your other resolutions as well.

Working smart involves rethinking how you do your job. If your
office is like most, you and your coworkers have probably transferred
many legacy habits to your current jobs. Look around. How are
telephone messages distributed?

Still using those pink message slips?

Who sets up meetings? Does your company continue to torture
secretaries and administrative staff by making them call lists
of people and manually coordinate the best meeting time and
location?

Dig a little deeper. Are you using the right tool for the task?
Do you use a spreadsheet as a glorified calculator? Do administrative
folks use the tables in a word processor to calculate expense
reports?

How does your company distribute information? Are your business
presentations chock-full of boring lists? Do managers sleep
during presentations, awaking only to render a decision?

I'm always amazed at the incredible misuse of technology. In
many organizations, you see computers everywhere, but they
don't contribute to the bottom line.

What's the solution? For starters, let's consider communications
aids, group calendars, and user training and education courses.
Communications aids combine several technologies.

Take clip art. Imagine you've prepared a business report and
you want your audience to get the gist of both the good news
and the bad news. Rather than force them to wade through nothing
but boring lists of numbers or a gaggle of graphs, try supplementing
your work with clip art. You could spread the good news by
including an image of a cheerleader, a superhero taking flight
or a person toting a bag of coins accompanied by the caption
"We're crying all the way to the bank." You can transmit the
notion of bad news quickly with a clip-art image of a golfer
missing a swing, a worried man sitting at his desk with a downward
spiraling chart behind him or a businessperson perched in a
tree with the caption, "We're out on a limb with this product."

One more tip: Put your pictures on the left side of a screen
or page, and text or numbers on the right. According to brain
research experts, this technique wakes up both sides of the
brain and gets the message across more quickly.

My favorite clip-art collection is Task Force from New Vision
Technologies. Some of the characters had my staff ROFL (that's
rolling on the floor, laughing). Along with the zany characters
are plenty of images for more staid corporate cultures where
humor isn't politically correct.

Color counts

Color is another great communicator. It speeds the viewer's
perception of trends by up to four times over black and white.

Fortunately, the cost of color has dropped considerably over
the past few years. At the beginning of this decade, a decent
color printer would have set you back $15,000 to $25,000. Today,
Tektronix, Lexmark and Hewlett-Packard provide exquisite color
output for a fraction of that cost. Top-quality color printers
now range from $2,500 to $7,500 depending on the technology
they use (laser, thermal wax or phase-change solid ink)

The price of LCD panels has also dropped. Expect to pay between
$3,000 and $6,000 for a quality LCD panel. I'm partial to those
by In Focus, Sharp and Proxima. Also, make sure you pair your
panel with a high-intensity overhead projector. No dim lights,
please!

By now, you may be wondering if the time it takes to shop for
all this stuff, and then get comfortable using it, is worth
the eventual productivity gain. It is. If you stick with it,
you'll start preparing materials faster-and, more importantly,
your audience will make decisions faster.

And start using a group scheduler. I know I've sung this tune
before, but I'll keep singing it until paper appointment calendars
are driven from desktops. They should come with a warning label
that says "Caution: This product may be hazardous to your company's
productivity."

Do I sound too severe? My firm's research shows companies that
still use paper calendars consume (make that waste) 20 to 25
percent of their administrative staff's time scheduling meetings
and updating duplicate calendar copies. The situation is even
worse for organizations slim on support staff where white-collar
professionals may spend a day a week on administrative tasks.

I shudder to think that in this age of excellent group scheduling
products-Microsoft's Schedule+, Novell's Groupwise-people still
make meetings with only slightly modified versions of a quill
pen and parchment tablet. This silently robs people of time
they could spend on more productive work, and it artificially
inflates staffing needs. Even if companies do buy group scheduling
products, many workers in the organization barely understand
how to use them.

This takes me to my last suggestion: training and education.
Lack of how-to knowledge robs companies blind. Instructor-led
courses, which cost $99 to $395 per person per day, are a small
price to pay for increased efficiency. If that's too pricey,
consider video and computer-based training courses. They're
not as effective as live interaction with instructors, but
they beat no training at all.

Special-interest groups within your organization are a good
way to spread expertise and knowledge. Users can learn a lot
from other users.

Some organizations prefer to import knowledge by hiring a consultant
to teach users special techniques about technology. Just make
sure someone opens the session with a discussion about choosing
the right tool for the task.

If you need to justify training-course expenses, use simple
math. If each person picks up only one tip from a course, then
uses it to save 30 minutes per workday, that translates to
6.25 percent of that person's average work time. It adds up
to 2.5 hours per week, or an average of $2,400 per year per
person in labor savings. That sure sounds like a decent return
on investment.

I'll bring you more productivity-boosting technologies and techniques
later this year. In the meantime, Happy New Year and best of
luck with your work-smart program.

Dialog box: I'm sitting at my Mac, pondering the most overhyped product
in history.

By:
BRADLEY JOHNSON

It's Windows 95. I'm wearing the "Been there, done that" T-shirt
Apple sent to journalists as part of its "Windows Truth" campaign.
The company's goal was to convince the world that Windows 95
is just a poor imitation of the Macintosh operating system.

Apple's partially right: Windows 95 makes an average PC clone
almost as easy to use as a Mac. Windows 95 isn't as good as
the Mac OS. It may not even be as good as IBM's floundering
OS/2 Warp.

But in the technology business,"best" isn't good enough. Sony's
Beta was the superior videotape standard, but most makers of
videocassette recorders opted for VHS because Sony bungled
its licensing strategy. Today, all the hit movies at Blockbuster
are on VHS. With VHS, consumers got what they deserved: a competitive
market for electronic hardware and an abundance of software.
Ditto Windows 95.

And the Mac? Been there, done that. I'm using my Mac less and
less, and spending more time on a Windows 95 PC. I'm happily
buying into the Win95 hype. Masterful hype turns a good product
into a global movement, and I don't feel like being left behind.
If this software is good enough for my haircutter, a camera
guy I met at a TV station and a cabbie, it's good enough for
me.

Microsoft, other PC software and hardware makers, and retailers
are spending an estimated $700 million on advertising and promotion
to ensure that Windows 95 becomes the VHS of computers. The
computer industry stands to make billions off the success of
Windows 95.

But there's a downside to all this hype: The product can never
live up to its buildup. As the young, obsessed managers at
Microsoft like to say, Windows 95 isn't a cure for cancer.
It can't even eradicate bugs. The software giant had to offer
replacement disks to squash a bug just days after the product's
introduction.

Bugs are inevitable in software, but the pressure is on Microsoft
to fix them-and not to leave customers stranded. Microsoft
is pitching Windows 95 to millions of people who've never even
used computers. If Microsoft doesn't deliver customer satisfaction,
its reputation will crash faster than, well, the early Windows
95 beta it sent out last spring.

Fear not. Microsoft's campus is brimming with people driven
to build good products, and the company can deliver on its
promises. Bill Gates, best known for being the richest guy
on Earth, is not P.T. Barnum selling his circus acts to suckers.
And Windows 95 isn't New Coke, an overhyped product no one
wanted. Win95 is what the computer industry and users want
and need: a good product backed by a great vision.

In the ever-changing world of computers, Gates is selling a
compelling view of where technology will take us. That's the
sort of vision Apple founder Steve Jobs and former chairman
John Sculley offered in the 1980s. Today, Apple has lost that
vision thing, but Gates is seeing 20/20 through his smudged
glasses. He's offering Windows 95 to take computer users exactly
where they want to go today. For $89.95, Windows 95 is a bargain
fare to the future.

Gates' salesmanship (read: hype) is causing hundreds of PC makers,
thousands of software developers and millions of customers
to buy into Windows 95, creating a computer supermarket of
products. The combination of mass appeal and competition means
this hype-as with VHS-is buying a good deal for users.

Microsoft appropriated many Macintosh features for Windows 95,
so it's not surprising Microsoft also borrowed the concept
of computer hype. Apple turned Macintosh into a global sensation
with a 1984 Super Bowl commercial that suggested the new computer
could save the world from Big Brother. Unfortunately, the original
Mac didn't have the software to do that or much else. Because
of bungled business decisions, what was called "the computer
for the rest of us" is used by less than 10 percent of us.

By contrast, Windows 95 succeeds clunky, tired Windows 3.x,
which is used on some 80 percent of PCs. Given that the world
had already settled for bad Windows, the introduction of good
Windows is something worth hyping.

Windows 95 is, to be sure, a media Circus Maximus. Microsoft
encouraged the frenzy with an army of public relations executives
and an aggressive effort to put early versions of Win95 into
the hands (and PCs) of journalists. During the carnival-themed
launch at Microsoft's suburban Seattle headquarters, some 3,000
journalists jostled for interviews with Gates, struggled to
find an exclusive angle on the overblown story and searched
for nonjournalists to interview. Not too different, perhaps,
from the upcoming political conventions, except Gates has a
higher ambition-it's global domination, stupid!

This was "Boys (and Girls) on the Bus" at its best. Microsoft
rented school buses to remove journalists from the grounds
after the all-day event.

In the month leading up to the Aug. 24 introduction, journalists
wrote more than 6,000 Win95 stories. During the week before
the launch, TV stations and networks ran 345 segments on the
topic, approaching the coverage devoted to Bosnia, according
to Medialink Public Relations Research. During the three weeks
leading to launch, NBC and its CNBC cable channel accounted
for 70 percent of total Win95 coverage among the major network
and cable news outlets. NBC and Microsoft, coincidentally,
have numerous business dealings.

Microsoft doesn't deserve-and doesn't claim-full credit for
this PR coup. "We just got the ball rolling," one PR staffer
says. Then all media creatures great and small jumped in, not
wanting to miss The Big Story.

A case of media lemmings rushing headlong toward the hype? There's
no doubt a bit of that, but Windows 95 is worth writing about
and reading about as a cultural and business phenomenon.

The birth of this savior is a once-in-a-lifetime event. Windows
95 arrives as the masses leap into the computer and Internet
age. It's backed by every advertising and promotional trick
imaginable, on an unprecedented global scale.

Like any pop culture phenomenon, Windows 95 has taken on a life
of its own. But when Microsoft unveils the sequel in two to
three years, it's unlikely the world will again stop to watch.
The Second Coming happens only once.

Graphics: Gryphon Batch It -- Convert a New Batch of Images


A graphic artist's work is (almost) never done. There are always
files to convert from one format to another. Gryphon Batch
It helps perform these critical image-processing and batch
mode operations. With its "tile" interface, Gryphon Batch It

Want to perform a color correction on a series of images? Just
drag out a few tiles and link them together; Gryphon Batch
It does the rest. The program's image utility performs tasks
in succession by "linking" specific tiles. You can resize,
adjust brightness and contrast, and convert several images
to a different file format in a single batching process.

Gryphon Batch It saves the tiles that define a particular batch
sequence. The application works in the background while you
perform other tasks.

Business Software: WinMerge 2.1 -- Point-and-Shoot Merging



WinMerge 2.1 lifts screen data from virtually any Windows-based
application for point-and-shoot merging into word processing
applications such as Microsoft Word, WordPerfect and Word Pro.

WinMerge lets you switch from a form letter with the click of
a mouse, so you can create form letters with drop-in merge
fields. You don't have to learn merge procedures, there's no
need to manually type in merge commands, and you don't have
to learn how to create and maintain OLE links.

Winlab First Impressions: Paradox 7 -- Easy Way from Data Maze to Database

By:
James E. Powell

From the moment you launch Paradox 7 and use the new Startup
Expert, you know you're using a vastly improved database. New
experts take you through the chores of creating tables and
databases, running mail-merge applications, building charts
or importing ASCII data. The Startup Expert even steps you
through building seven predefined applications that Paradox
7 provides, including a powerful contact manager application
complete with forms, tabbed menu choices and reports.

Paradox's Form, Report and Mailing Label Experts now let you
use aliases or path names for saving files, and accept both
queries and tables for input. The Mailing Label Expert now
allows you to define nonstandard label formats, and the Mail
Merge Expert creates documents using WordPerfect, Microsoft
Word or Paradox's own report writer. The new Chart Expert helps
you graph your data 18 different ways. Fixed-length or delimited
text files are easy pickings for the Import Expert, which also
lets you save your layout definition for future use. To give
your application a professional look, use the Application Launcher
Expert to design a tabbed window from which your forms, reports
or queries can be launched.

Version 7's Table Expert makes it easier to create a table.
Using this expert, you build a new table by selecting bits
and pieces from other databases. Cannibalize your own tables
or those provided, such as Paradox's predefined Orders table.
It's a great time-saver, especially if you need to create several
small, but similar, databases.

After you've developed your data formats, the Report Expert
helps you design the data displays. The program has several
new display options, including a pleasing 3-D look. Version
7's Report Expert also streamlines some operations, such as
adding page numbers and defining page breaks. The banded report
designer simplifies adding or repositioning fields, grouping
them and adding GUI objects such as check boxes and graphics.

The Object Explorer, which is available throughout Paradox,
lets you click on any object and change properties, such as
the font size and color and the visible/hidden setting. You
can also view the object's place in the hierarchy (report,
group, field, label and so on), and use the alignment options
to set the horizontal or vertical spacing among objects or
to make their horizontal or vertical sizes conform. The Object
Explorer also has tabs for inspecting methods and events. Double
click on a method, and an edit box pops up where you can add
your own method code.

Paradox's ObjectPAL Editor has been enhanced to include functionality
found in Borland's C++ compiler and the company's Delphi development
product. New to the Editor are color syntax highlighting, indenting
and outdenting, keyboard recording, incremental search, keyboard
mapping (to mimic Brief and Epsilon, for instance), bookmarks
and multilevel undo and redo.

The Design Layout dialog lets you quickly change an existing
report's look, switching from individual fields to a table,
for example. New controls for forms-such as list boxes with
multiselect, combo boxes, spin controls and progress bars-are
available. You can now create tabbed dialog boxes and place
data on the tab sections-an especially useful way to segregate
the information in large records. Select the number of tabs
and determine how many are displayed in each row.

Current users will be pleased that version 7 maintains compatibility
with Paradox 5 data, forms, reports, queries and applications
without any special conversion steps. Just open the objects
in Paradox 7. This means you can use version 7 to easily convert
Windows 3.x applications built with Paradox 5 to Windows 95.

Paradox 7 also supports OCX controls so you can extend its functionality
with third-party add-ins to add features like pop-up calendars
to your applications. The controls can be manipulated

with ObjectPAL, Paradox's programming language. ObjectPAL has
been enhanced with over 100 new methods, including 10 that
provide MAPI functions like Send Mail.

Version 7 can be used as an OLE automation controller (to execute
the functions revealed by another server-enabled application)
and a server (to let it be controlled)

Paradox 7 boasts a few fit-and-finish touches, too. For instance,
a new menu system organizes the functions more logically. You
can dock Paradox's customizable toolbars to any screen edge,
and add Paradox to the Microsoft Office and Novell PerfectOffice
toolbars.

Despite its new features, Paradox has some odd inconsistencies.
When you select the File/New/Table command, you're tossed directly
into the table builder, bypassing the Table Expert. But if
you pick File/New/Form, you're offered the choice of creating
a form from scratch or using the Form Expert. At times, the
Experts, too, may be sources of confusion, like when it jumps
you from step 2 to step 5. This isn't a goof. It's done to
maintain consistency among steps-step 5 always controls chart
type, for example-but it can be perplexing.

Still, Paradox 7 does whatever it can to help the new or occasional
user. The CD Quick Tour offers an animated program overview,
and the Windows 95-style help is clear and easy to follow.
Even in the beta version I tested, the help system answered
all my questions.

With Paradox 7, Borland has taken a giant step in making database
application development accessible. While there's still room
for improvement, Paradox 7 is a good choice for building anything
from a simple database to a complex data-intensive application.

Winlab First Impressions: Toshiba Tecra 700CT -- 120MHz Book's a Burner

By:
Jim Forbes

While other notebook manufacturers walk the razor's edge trying
to balance performance against weight and price, veteran laptop
maker Toshiba America takes a different tack. Its hot new Tecra
700 series is powered by a 120MHz Pentium processor and, when
fully configured, can take a $6,000 bite out of your wallet.
But the unit's 7.3-pound heft makes it obvious that Toshiba
has come down on the side of performance. And the Tecra 700
delivers the goods in spades through its use of the PCI architecture
and the attention to design detail that have become the mark
of Toshiba products.

The Tecra 700 is indeed dense. The 7.3-pound travel weight includes
its surprisingly small power supply, an external 3.5-inch floppy
disk drive and case. Its dimensions and overall shape, however,
resemble those of other Toshiba notebook computers.

The unit I tested, the Tecra 700CT, arrived with an optional
quad-speed CD-ROM drive, a lithium ion battery, 16MB of RAM,
a brilliant 11.3-inch active-matrix display, Sound Blaster
Pro-compatible sound and some of the best internal speakers
I've heard on a notebook. This machine also comes with serial,
parallel, PS/2, SVGA, serial infrared and two stacked Type
II PCMCIA slots, as well as a docking-station port.

The Tecra 700 ships standard with a removable 1.2GB hard drive.
A lower-cost version with an 11.3-inch passive-matrix color
display and 8MB of RAM will also be available soon.

This computer is not designed for globe-trotting journalists
looking to write the Great American Novel over the Atlantic,
or corporate managers working on that career-defining spreadsheet
between New York and the West Coast. Not surprisingly, given
this notebook's hungry processor, hard drive and screen, its
battery life (which I measured at well under two hours) is
not a strong point. But since this machine is much more likely
to run connected to a wall outlet than on batteries, I don't
think this is a serious problem.

One of the features I particularly like on the Tecra 700 is
its ability to use the optional CD-ROM and its 3.5-inch drive
simultaneously-something you can't do with other high-end notebooks
such as the NEC Versa 4000 or the Gateway 2000 Solo. Drives
attach to a pocket on the front of the unit, under the keyboard.
This pocket will accept either the CD-ROM or 3.5-inch drive.
To use both drives, you must insert the CD-ROM into this pocket
and attach the 3.5-inch drive to an external connector that
sits on the right-hand side.

I also like Toshiba's use of a quad-speed CD-ROM drive, which
makes short work of loading complex programs.

The active-matrix color screen on the unit I tested, a prototype
version, is as suited to showing full-motion video as it is
to giving presentations in the boardroom. Video speed is greatly
enhanced by the notebook's PCI bus.

The keyboard is comfortable to use for extended periods and
sits behind a palm rest. Like all Toshiba computers, this machine
uses a stick pointing device to position the cursor. The pointer
is located above the B key on the keyboard, and its two associated
buttons are on the palm rest. All controls and switches are
easy to find and use. Lighted status displays for power, drive
access and other features are on the front, which for some
users may not seem particularly instinctive.

Like other Toshiba notebooks, this machine is built like a tank.
For added security, there's a 3-year limited warranty.

On our WINDOWS Magazine Wintune benchmarks, the Tecra 700CT
delivered an astounding 217MIPS and 67MFLOPS. The 1.2GB hard
drive had a cached throughput rating of 12.5MB per second,
and the video generated 6Mpixels per second. The unit took
an average of 28.33 seconds to execute our Word 7.0 macro,
and 24.33 seconds to complete our Excel 7.0 macro.

This machine is not for everyone. In fact, the price means it's
unlikely ever to be a big seller. Nevertheless, like other
notebooks in the Toshiba line, the Tecra 700 should be a standard
setting piece of hardware.

--Info File--

Toshiba Tecra 700CT

Price: $5,999 (with 4x CD-ROM, 11.3-inch TFT screen and 16MB
of RAM)

In Brief: This notebook computer offers great performance, uses
the PCI architecture, has an optional quad-speed CD-ROM drive
and can display full-motion video on its 11.3-inch screen.

Winlab First Impressions: Harvard Graphics 4.0 for Windows 95 -- 
Smooth Delivery for Your Pitch

By:
James E. Powell

On the surface, Harvard Graphics 4.0 is much like the version
for Windows 3.1. But once you dive beneath the surface and
get beyond the standard Windows 95 features like tabbed dialog
boxes, context menus and common toolbars, you'll discover a
rich set of tips and other helpful aids, including new quick
start presentation templates. These new features will get you
up and running in no time.

For harried presenters, the Quick Presentations option provides
a variety of templates for common types of pitches. The templates
include Marketing Plan, a Quarterly Review and a Business Plan
to Partners. This version has five new templates, and all are
more than just graphic design elements-they also get you going
on your presentation's content with suggested text, such as
a sample agenda. You can also add templates that you develop
to the Quick Presentations choices.

The program's Graphics Advisor System, a combination of help
and advice, has always been impressive. You can use the Design
Checker to inspect for presentation faux pas, such as too many
bullets on one slide. The new Fixer Mode will take you to the
right place in the program to fix errors that the Advisor detected.

In addition to the Advisor, Harvard Graphics offers a couple
of other comfort-inducing features. A Quick Tour shows you
around the program and describes its major features, and the
"Five Minute Coach" provides some more-than-basic instruction
about creating text slides, building charts or delivering effective
presentations.

Harvard Graphics includes a "light" version of Harvard Montage
for managing image libraries and the more than 500 pieces of
clip art also in the package.

Some of this version's more subtle changes are worth noting.
For example, you can now include text in superscript or subscript,
and control type leading more accurately. You can use Find
and Replace across an entire presentation, and printed output
can be page numbered. When you switch between landscape and
portrait modes, the new Aspect Ratio Correction feature makes
appropriate adjustments to all the objects on the slide.

The program is extremely easy to use. You can resequence slides
by dragging them in the Slide View, and if you drag a slide
from one presentation to another, Harvard Graphics adjusts
its properties to keep it consistent with the rest of the presentation.
Other features include dockable toolbars, VCR-style navigation
controls, and slide sorter and outline views. For most options,
there are thumbnail graphics or previews to show what the selection
looks like. Though HG offers its own charting capabilities,
its OLE 2.0 support lets you drag charts from Excel or text
from Microsoft Word into a slide.

Harvard Graphics still lags behind the competition in some areas.
For instance, the program doesn't support simple animations
that are included in some rival programs, including PowerPoint's
latest release. This makes it impossible to move objects around
to create some dramatic effects. Among other things, you can't
set the bars in a bar chart to "grow" from the x-axis and you
can't fly in other graphics elements.

Harvard Graphics is a lone wolf in a world of application suites.
Most of these suites include presentation graphics programs,
so you might wonder if you really need Harvard Graphics. The
answer is a resounding yes. The product offers excellent help,
an eye-pleasing set of predefined templates and a simplicity
that belies its highly professional output.

Winlab First Impressions: NEC Versa 4000C and 4050C -- The Complete Notebook

By:
Jim Forbes

It's not often you run across a product that does everything
right. NEC has come very close to producing a notebook computer
that fits that criterion with its Versa 4000 family, an innovative
series of Pentium-powered notebook computers. Simply stated,
these machines are an exercise in elegance.

The NEC 4000 family comes standard with Intel's 75-, 90- or
120MHz Pentium processors for portable computers, 16MB of RAM
(8MB for 75MHz), 256KB of level 2 cache, a variety of hard
drives, and a choice of 10-plus-inch active-matrix color and
dual-scan color screens. Also standard is a full array of external
connectors including serial, parallel, docking station, two
stacked Type 2 and two IRDA-1 infrared transceivers (one on
the front and one on the back)

All the NEC Versa 4000 family members have the same basic shape
and size. They measure 2.1 by 11.7 by 9.5 inches. The travel
weight, including the battery charger, is about 7 pounds (depending
on which screen you order). The 4000C unit I examined had a
10.1-inch, 640x480 active-matrix display; a 75MHz processor;
a 540MB hard drive; and 16MB of RAM.

Although I've criticized the keyboards on previous NEC notebooks,
I like the one on this model almost as much as I like the Lexmark
keyboard IBM uses on its ThinkPad line. Unlike older NEC machines,
this keyboard includes an integrated palm rest and uses a Versa
Glide touchpad pointing device with double-tap capability.
The trackpad is located to the left-center of the palm rest,
which some users may find uncomfortable.

The NEC V4000 family's sound subsystem should please anyone
who really needs to punctuate presentations with audio. NEC
has built two decent speakers into the case. They are placed
high enough so your audience can hear your presentation clearly.

Virtually all the controls are positioned intuitively and within
fast reach. And NEC has included software that simplifies control
of the power-saving features.

Like Gateway 2000's Solo, the Versa 4000 series uses a single
bay (VersaBay II in NEC parlance) to accommodate a dual-speed
CD-ROM drive, a 3.5-inch disk drive, a second battery or a
second hard drive. Unfortunately, you can't hot swap drives.
To change from the 3.5-inch drive to the CD-ROM, you have to
power down the computer, pull out one drive, snap in the other
and reboot.

NEC gets bonus points for including a small zip-up pouch that
houses the unused drive and a hard-shell case large enough
for the computer, its documentation, the unused drive and other
paraphernalia.

The battery life on the unit I tested was about 2.5 hours without
power conservation (other than turning off the audio and removing
my 28.8Kbps modem). With strict power conservation, I was able
to run it about 3.5 hours on its single lithium ion power cell.
NEC claims Quick Charge Time takes about 2.5 hours; this unit
took less-slightly more than 2 hours.

The results of our WINDOWS Magazine Wintune 95 benchmarks were
135MIPS and 40MFLOPs for the 4000C, 5.23Mpixels per second
for the video and 9.16MB per second cached data-transfer rate
for the hard drive. The 4000C took 21 seconds to execute our
Excel 7.0 macro and 36.3 seconds to complete our Microsoft
Word 7.0 macro.

Priced at $5,100, the 90MHz 4050C -with 16MB of RAM and 810MB
hard drive-posted 162MIPS, 48MFLOPS, 5.5Mpixels per second
and cached hard drive throughput of 9.94MB per second. Times
to execute the Excel 7.0 and Word 7.0 macros were 14 and 39.66
seconds, respectively.

There are few tasks for which the Versa 4000C is not suited.
Its audio and video subsystems make it a dream for presentations,
and its Pentium processor has the horsepower for virtually
any undertaking. It has a full suite of connections, and NEC
offers a docking station that makes the Versa 4000C an ideal
desktop replacement. This notebook has a 3-year warranty.

The Versa 4000 family is brawny, yet elegant. Its VersaBay lets
you add a CD-ROM, a 3.5-inch disk drive or other peripheral
as the need arises. That, and the ability to use a docking
station that has expansion ports, make for a very attractive
and versatile-package.

Winlab First Impressions: NEC PowerMate P133 and Ready 9542 -- 
Twin Towers for Home, Office

By:
Jim Forbes and James E. Powell

NEC Technologies makes stunning monitors and rugged notebooks.
It also makes terrific desktop computers, as evidenced by the
PowerMate and Ready series. We were extremely pleased with
the two latest offerings, both 133MHz Pentium systems.

These machines are similar in many respects. Both use a PCI
bus and come standard with 2MB of video memory, 16MB of RAM,
infrared support and a generous 1.6-gigabyte hard drive. They
also boast a full battery of ports, full-sized keyboard, NEC
branded mouse, 16-bit Sound Blaster-compatible audio and great
speakers. Both are housed in a wide mini-tower case that allows
easy access to the internal components.

The PowerMate series is aimed at the corporate market and includes
a minimal software bundle, since most of its users prefer to
install their own applications. The Ready line is designed
to be sold by computer retailers and includes an impressive
software lineup.

At $3,299, the PowerMate P133 is the more expensive of the two
systems. The basic configuration includes a 6x CD-ROM drive
and a small software bundle. Getting inside the mini-tower
case is a snap: Just twirl two readily identifiable machine
screws, lift out a side panel and you're in. This is a much
more elegant and useful way of opening up a system than removing
an entire cover assembly.

The PowerMate P133 has two ISA and four PCI open slots so it
can grow with your needs. The 6x CD-ROM is wickedly fast, and
the speakers that ship with this unit have a rating of 8 watts.
Other goodies include a full complement of communications programs,
a TranXit infrared software front-end and support for voice
input.

The Ready 9542, geared more toward the home market, also has
two ISA and four PCI open slots, though one PCI slot can be
used only to replace the on-board video. It ships with a 4x
CD-ROM and nearly two dozen multimedia titles, including games
such as Descent. The system includes MPEG-1-software compatibility
for full-screen video playback, SRS 3-D surround sound, wavetable
audio and a telephone answering system with speakerphone.

Productivity titles include Microsoft Works, Publisher, Quicken
SE and Encarta. The Ready also ships with Bob-which you can
remove-and Midisoft's MediaWorks, a similar but less cutesy
Windows 95 front-end that resembles a home office. MediaWorks
includes utilities that let you capture and edit video and
audio or send a fax.

A 28.8Kb-per-second modem with DSVD (for simultaneous voice
and data transmission) is also part of the package, as is Netscape
Navigator and sign-up kits for the major online services.

The PowerMate offers you the option of installing Windows for
Workgroups or Windows 95 when you power up for the first time.
We installed the Workgroups edition, then used our own copy
of Win95 to upgrade, which took 24 minutes.

The Ready unit comes with a setup program that first examines
the installed equipment, then loads the installation program
for Win95. In all, it took 30 minutes to install the operating
system before we could use the machine, an annoyance that beginning
users-presumably the primary intended buyers for this desktop
shouldn't have to deal with.

The PowerMate P133 blew the doors off most of our Wintune 95
benchmarks. Its 133MHz processor cranked out 246MIPS and 74MFLOPS,
while its hard disk scored a 3.43MB-per-second uncached data
transfer rate. Due to a problem with the video driver, we could
not report a video score in our standard 800x600-pixel, 256
color mode.

The Ready 9542 was similarly impressive, yielding 244MIPS and
74MFLOPS. The Maxtor hard drive's uncached performance was
3.5MBps, and its video system pumped out 13.1Mpixels per second.

The results of our applications benchmarks were also good, but
not quite as startling. The PowerMate P133 took only 39.66
seconds to execute the 32-bit version of our WinWord macro
and a scant 17.33 seconds to run our 32-bit Excel macro. The
Ready unit took 19.7 seconds with Word and 40.3 seconds with
Excel.

If you're looking for Pentium 133 power at a reasonable price,
these units should be at the top of your shopping list.

--Info File--

Price: PowerMate, $3,299 (without monitor); Ready, $2,999 (without

In Brief: The NEC PowerMate P133 and Ready 9542 are both full
featured, PCI-bus, 133MHz Pentium systems in a mini-tower case.
The PowerMate is aimed at corporate buyers, while the Ready
is intended for the home user.

Winlab First Impressions: FileMaker Pro 3.0 -- Old Friend with New Relations

By:
James E. Powell

Sometimes it takes a while to commit to a relationship. For
FileMaker Pro-long a favorite among flat-file fans-its long
awaited foray into the relational world is welcome.

FileMaker Pro 3.0, which I tested in beta, now lets you create
one-to-many and many-to-one relationships between two files,
including a minimal amount of referential integrity. The program
retains its look-up feature, which copies data from one file
to another-sometimes all the relational capability you need.
You can glimpse into another database to set up master/detail
reports and forms with a special object called a portal. Although
it's an effective process, it isn't as effortless or intuitive
as similar operations in Approach or Access.

FileMaker Pro is well designed, making it easy to use and navigate,
especially for database beginners. It still doesn't have a
traditional programming language, but its script builder is
among the simplest to learn, understand and use that I've ever
seen. You can build scripts with programming constructs such
as loops and if/then/else, and you can include custom messages
complete with OK and Cancel buttons. The program also supports
variables, which it calls global fields.

Database files are easily set up, and the tabbed dialog boxes
let you set options such as range checking and automatic serialization
for numeric fields. Vastly improved built-in functions, like
Future Value, IsEmpty and Length, make it possible to build
complex validation rules. You don't get a wide range of field
types to choose from, but the unique, repeating field type
lets you create multiple field values within a single record.

Forms are easy to create and can contain traditional GUI elements,
such as radio buttons and check boxes. You can also set the
order in which the cursor moves through fields when you press
the Tab key.

Although the reporting module is generally simple to use, setting
up totals and subtotals is cumbersome. You have to assign summary
fields to the database, specifying which calculation to perform
(sum, count, average) and upon which field to perform it. Then,
position the summary field on your report. In most other database
programs, you would define the calculation field on the report
itself.

You can quickly create forms for columnar reports, labels and
envelopes. But the program lacks wizards to help you through
creating more complex reports. You can, however, display actual
record data from a sample to facilitate setting field sizes,
with empty fields replaced by dummy text or numbers FileMaker
Pro generates.

Specify colors, fonts and object alignment for forms and reports.
You can lock objects so they don't get accidentally nudged,
draw your own lines and boxes, and use snap-to-grid for alignment
help. In this version, you can format paragraphs, including
custom indents and precise line spacing, but you still can't
format a numeric field as a telephone number.

Automatic phone dialing and mail merge are also new in this
version. And you can now have up to 50 files open simultaneously,
rather than the previous version's 16. Windows 95 features
include long filenames, uninstall and OLE Container support.
Field indexing is now optional, and you can let FileMaker Pro
create indexes when necessary to speed up searches and sorts.

Other features of the network-ready FileMaker Pro include a
spell checker, a converter that imports files created with
other programs and the ability to export a file's structure
without its data. Assign groups and passwords, and specify
security down to the field level. More unusual features include
the ability to find records containing illegal date and time
values or duplicate values.

For current FileMaker users, the look and feel of version 3.0
will be immediately comfortable. Database dilettantes will
find FileMaker Pro's ease of use and jargon-free manuals refreshing.

Winlab First Impressions: Windows Draw 4.0 -- Palatable Price for Paint App

By:
James Bell

For little more than the cost of a computer book, you can pick
up a great Windows 95 drawing program. Micrografx's Windows
Draw 4.0, which I tested in beta, includes both drawing and
image-editing modules, along with 250 fonts and over 10,000
pieces of clip art.

Although the bundle is marketed for home use, don't assume it's
a limited package. While the low-cost program doesn't include
all the features of Micrografx's high-end ABC Graphics Suite,
Windows Draw is a useful office addition.

Windows Draw makes good use of the Win95 interface. If you've
worked with Microsoft Office 95, you'll find Windows Draw especially
easy to learn as it mimics Office's menus, commands and toolbars.
You can also customize your screen layout and use tear-off
toolbars that can be docked or left to float in the drawing
window.

All the Windows Draw modules support OLE 2.0, drag-and-drop,
and in-place editing. You can drag clip art from ABC Media
Manager, the clip-art manager, into either the drawing or image
editing module and the program will automatically handle any
necessary format conversions. Windows Draw supports over 50
vector and bitmap graphics formats.

Nonartists will appreciate Windows Draw's 150 drawing templates.
They're organized into six categories-Celebrations, Diagrams,
Publishing, Fun, Games and Sports-and cover everything from
play money to floor plans and stationery. You have to master
some basic skills to use the templates effectively, since they
are predesigned documents that you modify manually. Each template
includes suggestions for where to start making changes, but
a few well-placed wizards would have been helpful for new users.

Windows Draw's drawing tools have been substantially updated
from version 3.0. Beyond the standard fare-lines, ovals, rectangles
and B zier curves-there are 11 new CoolShape tools for one
step polygons, stars, arrows and 3-D shapes. The program even
automatically shades the 3-D CoolShapes (too automatically
sometimes, as you can't control the light direction)

Among the new features are "sticky" connecting lines that make
it a snap to create organizational charts, flowcharts and annotations
for illustrations. Also new are multiple levels of undo, a
spell checker, a "format painter" for quickly copying object
formatting and multiple drawing layers.

Windows Draw's image editor, Photo Magic, now supports TWAIN
compatible scanners and includes options for cropping, rotating,
resizing, and modifying resolution and color depth. A Stitch
feature lets you recombine images that were scanned in separate
sections. Photo Magic's powerful masking tools can mask specific
color ranges and create freehand masks.

Photo Magic supports over 40 special effects, from basic picture
corrections-like sharpen, remove pattern, and adjust contrast
and brightness-to special effects such as add color noise,
wind, pop art, crystallize and charcoal. You can preview all
the effects.

It's also possible to draw images in Photo Magic, using the
dozen-plus painting tools that simulate chalk, pencils, markers,
crayons, pastels, oils and watercolors.

ABC Media Manager, also in the bundle, simplifies using the
package's clip art. You can also create your own clip-art libraries,
including thumbnails and searchable keywords and descriptions.

Windows Draw doesn't offer all the features of high-end drawing
packages. There are no color separations or sophisticated text
controls in Draw, or multiple object layers in Photo Magic.
For these capabilities, you'll have to turn to high-end graphics
packages from Micrografx, Adobe, Corel or Macromedia.

If you have professional needs and a larger budget, Windows
Draw may not be the program for you. But if you're looking
for a good entry-level drawing program for Windows 95 that
also works well with Office 95, this is it. Grab a copy before
Micrografx comes to its senses and raises the price.

Winlab First Impressions: CA-SuperProject 4.0 -- The Best Laid Plans

By:
Sara G. Stephens

There's an ironic, dark truth shared by many project managers.
Behind their impeccable PERT charts' veneer of order lie frenzied
efforts to patch every leak with last-minute scheduling fixes.
But haste can lay waste to even the best-planned project scenarios.

The folks at Computer Associates know how the real world of
project management works, so they graced SuperProject 4.0 with
a number of practical tools, not the least of which is a multi
level undo feature.

Like some of its competitors-Primavera System's SureTrak Project
Manager being the closest match-SuperProject blends the features
of a heavy-duty project manager into a lightweight-looking
package. And, while graphical interfaces generally make easier
to-use programs, too many graphics and macros can restrict,
or at least obscure, the functionality of a more sophisticated
app that requires entering and manipulating a lot of details
in various formats. It's a fine line between easy and messy.

Fortunately, SuperProject is on the right side of this line.
Each project view is tabbed like a file folder. You can open
multiple projects, stacking these "file folders" on top of
one another, and clicking on the tabs switches from one open
project to another. Like Microsoft Project, another close competitor,
SuperProject puts similar tabs on its dialog boxes and pop
up forms.

Other MS Project similarities include Calendar views, Gantt
charts that let you display different start and end symbols
for each item, and gridlines between rows. You can also combine
project windows on a single outline, PERT chart or WBS chart
view. The program's ability to illustrate interproject relationships
with distinctive symbols is especially useful in this mode.
You can use the Auto-Open feature to instruct SuperProject
to open related projects whenever you open a particular project
file.

Large organizations with mixed-breed setups should find SuperProject
4.0's expanded export/import formats particularly useful. It
now includes the .MPX (MS Project) extension. Even more significant
is the program's LAN support installed via CA's Activate program.
It's compatible with IBM PC, 3Com, Novell NetWare, Banyan and
other networks. This feature, combined with the program's ODBC
support, means subproject managers can each update the server
residing relational database from their desktops, regardless
of the database program they're using.

SuperProject can create a work breakdown structure with forms
that flow more intuitively than those I've seen in competing
products. For example, task, resource and account names have
a generous length limit of 56 characters. The program also
lets you check your project schedule's progress by transferring
it to as many as three baselines, rather than the traditional
single-baseline option.

Because the fruits of a project manager's work eventually must
be printed and shared with staff or management, CA also improved
SuperProject's reporting capabilities. It now prints bitmaps
in a report's header and footer. It also lets you Print to
Fit, so you won't be tied to your desk with a roll of Scotch
tape, piecing together panels of a Gantt chart. Balloon help
is convenient for newcomers, while a configurable toolbar lets
the more fluent SuperProject user customize his desktop with
up to 50 different buttons.

SuperProject comes bundled with TimeSheet Professional, an electronic
time-sheet app that integrates nicely to form a full project
and resource-management solution.

While many "improved interfaces" actually intimidate rather
than invite users, SuperProject combines color, graphics and
solid features so they not only look cool on the desktop, but
also let you keep cool-headed control of your projects.

CA-SuperProject 4.0

Winlab First Impressions: voysAccess for Visual Basic -- Dialing for Data

By:
James E. Powell

The term Interactive Voice Response (IVR) might seem cold, but
when you use the technology to phone and access up-to-the-minute
bank account information without talking to another person,
it's not just cool, but efficient, too. With voysAccess, a
toolkit that works with Visual Basic 3.0, you can build your
own custom IVR applications. The toolkit's designer is so simple
to use that your first IVR

VB-based application will be up and running in just a few hours.

VoysAccess, which I tested in beta, includes a custom VBX control
and voysDesigner, an application generator that lets you design
your voice response application in a spreadsheet-like grid.
You select actions from a toolbox or the main menu, then pick
action-specific options from dialog boxes. For example, your
logic can include commands to play a greeting, wait for digits
to be pressed, analyze the response and branch to a subroutine
based on the caller's keystrokes.

The Record command lets your customer leave a message, and you
have the option of limiting its length. You have to write the
logic that organizes these messages and plays them back. Because
the system supports variables, it's easy to create a "count"
field to tally the number of incoming calls. The system can
dial or transfer a call, too, and you can specify the number
of rings before your program terminates a call.

Using a caller's Touch-tone input, your application can retrieve
information from a database. The application can also respond
vocally, even formatting values such as adding the words "dollars"
and "cents" to currency fields and translating numerical dates
into their narrative equivalents.

To retrieve information you use the designer's Data Query Wizard
to map a schema of the data, including relationships between
tables and databases. The Query Wizard builds SQL statements
using Select, From, Where and Order By parameters, which can
be completed by picking field names and conditions from pop
up lists. The Query supports most popular database formats
dBASE, Paradox, Access and FoxPro-and ODBC.

The digits that a caller enters can also be captured as data
and stored in a database, so your application can receive information
as well as disseminate it.

Once you've designed your application, the designer generates
the entire application in Visual Basic code and can automatically
launch the application. The code-building process checks for
errors such as undefined branches. The resulting source code
is well commented and uses easy-to-understand function names,
such as voysAcces1.

Vspeak ="C:\MYAPP\HELLO" which "speaks" the HELLO voice file.

Programming purists may not like the way the voysDesigner worksheet
handles branching indentation because all actions are left
justified. However, the generated VB code is properly indented.

The toolkit includes a starter prompt library and a collection
of about 300 professionally recorded voice files. There is
also a sound processing and editing utility that supports .WAV, .VOX, .VOC 
and other sound file formats.

The package includes a two-line Dialogic voice card that is
required to run your completed application. Installing it is
relatively easy, though you'll need to manually set jumpers.

While there are a few alternatives available, voysAccess offers
the fastest, easiest route to custom VB-based IVR applications
that I've seen so far.

Winlab First Impressions: ClarisDraw 1.0 -- Drawing on Mac App-titude

By:
James Bell

A million Mac users can't be wrong. At least Claris hopes so,
as it tests the Windows waters with its popular ClarisDraw
graphics program. The company says the Mac version-along with
its predecessor, the MacDraw family-has an installed base of
almost a million users, and it has drawn heavily on that experience
to create ClarisDraw for Windows.

The beta version I tested is a 32-bit application that runs
under either Windows 95 or Windows 3.x. Designed for the general
business user, the program takes a simple, streamlined approach
to drawing, but also includes a handful of interesting surprises.

One of ClarisDraw's obvious advantages is its complete cross
platform compatibility with the Mac counterpart. You can even
convert MacDraw files after running them through a file "splitter"
utility (which ClarisDraw provides)

ClarisDraw's interface closely matches that of its Mac sibling.
While this would be helpful for someone using both platforms,
it's a real disadvantage for Windows users-especially Windows
95 users. There are no context menus, ribbon bars, tabbed dialog
boxes or even help balloons to describe program icons. Nor
does it support OLE or drag-and-drop between documents or with
other applications. None of these features are crucial to the
drawing process, but they would have made ClarisDraw easier
to learn and use.

To its credit, the program does provide some shortcuts, including
tear-off tool palettes that you can shrink down to just their
title bars when you're not using them.

ClarisDraw's real strength is the intelligence of its toolset.
Beyond the basic tools for drawing lines, curves, and standard
shapes like ovals and rectangles, you'll find several "smart"
features. These include 16 Shape tools for one-step creation
of polygons, stars, arrows, and 3-D boxes and cylinders. But
shading for 3-D shapes isn't provided, and you can't ungroup
them to add shading manually.

Other smart tools include SmartConnector lines that maintain
links between objects; SmartSize for scaling objects proportionally;
Guideliner and PointGuide for precisely positioning objects
and lines; and SmartAlign for keeping elements aligned or distributed,
even after being moved. ClarisDraw also provides quick format
tricks with SmartShadow and SmartEmbossing, and there's even
a search-and-replace feature called Replace Clones for substituting
one piece of clip art with another in a drawing.

ClarisDraw includes basic image-editing capabilities for imported
bitmaps and the ability to create black-and-white, 16-color
and 256-color images. If you can use the somewhat limited tools,
they can save you the trouble of having to switch to another
program. The software supports both HLS and RGB color palettes
but not CMYK-and bundles predesigned palettes of up to 256
colors.

Nonartists can import several PC and Mac graphic file formats,
including .EPS, .TIF, .CGM, .GIF, .WINF, PICT, PICT2, .BMP, .PCX, 
MacDraw, MacPaint and .AVI movie frames. Included, too,
are 60 TrueType fonts and 2,400 pieces of clip art. The clip
art is organized into drag-and-drop libraries, and you add
your own images by dragging them onto a library window.

It's also possible to import text and lay out ClarisDraw pages
by using linked text boxes. The program supports paragraph
formatting, text styles, a spell checker and thesaurus, and
both regular and irregular text wrapping around graphics. ClarisDraw
won't replace a true desktop publishing package but it should
satisfy most basic needs.

ClarisDraw's layering feature is a pleasant surprise. It's ideal
for floor plans, maps and diagrams, and can be used to create
slide shows, too. Slide shows can be augmented with fades,
bulleted text lists and simple sequence controls. Again, this
feature can't compete with dedicated presentation programs,
but it's adequate for simple projects.

Like the generalist users ClarisDraw was designed for, the program
doesn't aim to be the best in any particular category. Instead,
it focuses on providing simple, useful tools for the occasional
user. Limitations in its interface are offset by a bevy of
intelligent drawing options.

Winlab First Impressions: Dabbler 2 and Wacom ArtZ II Tablet -- 
Take One Tablet and Paint

By:
Hailey Lynne McKeefry

Perhaps it's true that a poor master blames his tools, but having
great tools can't hurt. The dynamic duo of Dabbler 2 and the
Wacom ArtZ II graphics tablet helped me discover my well-hidden
artistic talents.

The ArtZ II Tablet, which measures 0.5 by 13 by 9.6 inches,
has a 6-by-8-inch drawing space with a resolution of 2,540
lines per inch. The unit plugs into a serial port and comes
with drivers for Windows 95, 3.x and NT. A menu strip at the
top of the ArtZ II provides five user-definable function buttons
and 11 predefined buttons (including Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo,
Delete, New, Open and Save), as well as controls to change
pressure sensitivity.

Wacom's Erasing UltraPen, included with the tablet, literally
turns the world of graphics tablets upside down. If you use
it with an eraser-enabled application, you can flip the pen
over and rub its top against the tablet to erase what you just
drew. Dabbler, Fractal Design's Painter, SmartSketch, QFX and
Adobe Photoshop all support the eraser technology, and Autodesk
Animator Studio, Fauve Matisse and Aldus Freehand will support
it soon.

With the tablet in place, I loaded Dabbler from its CD-ROM.
The CD holds both 16-bit and 32-bit versions of the program,
in addition to more than 300 stencils, 120 paper testers, 3
image font libraries and 100 stock photographs.

Dabbler is the definitive program for anyone who wants to learn
PC-based drawing and have fun doing it. The program uses a
desk-and-drawer scenario-to peruse the selection of brushes,
colors or paper textures, you slide open the appropriate drawer.
Your sketch pad sits atop the on-screen desk, and you can flip
through its pages by clicking on the arrow keys. Rotating the
sketch pad lets you draw at any angle. The program also allows
you to create multiple sketchbooks and open them one at a time.

Dabbler's Multimedia Art Tutors led me through some of the basics
of cartooning and cartoon animation, as well as the nuts-and
bolts operation of the program. Although the program won't
let you draw as you watch the lessons, you can switch easily
back and forth between the two modes. Once you've mastered
animation, the Flipbook Animation feature lets you create animations
and export them as QuickTime or AVI movies.

The software's stencils, clip art and stock photos give you
a running start and help you get by that first blank page.
Once I had a stencil in place, I used the Effects menu to customize
the color and texture of the shapes. Dabbler's Effects include
Fill, Auto Clone, Fade, Glass Distortion, Motion Blur, Negative,
Sharpen, Soften and Texturize.

Dabbler also provides several features to help you forge and
use art elements from the CD-ROM or other images in any of
several formats (including RIFF, TIFF, PICT, Targa, BMP, PCX
and Photoshop). The Tracing Paper feature lets you pick an
image and trace it onto your drawing. You can also manipulate
an existing image using natural media cloning; this feature
lets you select an image and render it using the medium of
your choice (such as ink, oil paint or chalk)

Even with these great tools, my artwork isn't likely to end
up on a museum wall, but within an hour or so I was able to
create drawings that were better than I could have ever imagined.
The Wacom ArtZ II felt as natural as using a pen and paper,
and the eraser came in handy. Dabbler, which can also be used
with a mouse, is fun to use, versatile and provides enough
help that you're bound to learn something each time you use
it.

Winlab First Impressions: CleanSweep 95 -- Snappier App Zapper

By:
Rich Castagna

It's tough to say au revoir to ancient apps. Sure, parting with
old friends is hard, but it can get even harder if you accidentally
give the heave-ho to needed files along with those you really
want to deep-six. You can cross your fingers and whisper a
little prayer before clicking on Delete-or you can use CleanSweep
95.

The Windows 95 version of this uninstaller boasts big improvements
over its 16-bit predecessor. CleanSweep's tabbed interface
and step- by-step guidance not only make it easier to use,
but enable you to use the program with more confidence.

The tabs in the software's dialog divvy up its functions clearly.
From the Program tab, you can delete, archive, back up and
move files, or transport them to other computers. The Cleanup
tab scours your system by finding duplicate and orphan files,
redundant DLLs and infrequently used files. You can use Restore
to fetch files you've backed up, moved or transported, while
View lets you look at logs to see just what you've done. The
Options tab provides configuration settings to toggle the usage
monitor, set alerts for rarely accessed files and so forth.

Whatever you do, there's a wizard to lead the way. For example,
when you uninstall a program, you click your way through well
prompted steps that include suggestions for using CleanSweep
effectively-and safely. Just before your final click, CleanSweep
stops for confirmation and tells you how much space you'll
gain. You can also look at a list of program components if
you want to spare something from the purge.

If you don't want to shuffle a bunch of files into oblivion,
you can opt to keep them in compressed form; CleanSweep tucks
them away in a PKZIP-compatible format. When you find you do
need the app after all, a click on the Restore tab puts it
back in working condition.

The Master Log tracks almost everything CleanSweep does. You
can append each new activity to the printable file to keep
an audit trail, or you can clear it and start with a blank
slate. CleanSweep also outsmarts Win95's own uninstaller: It
will find programs that aren't in the Registry.

As you ring out your old apps and ring in new Win95 versions,
CleanSweep makes it easy to clear the clutter and keep your
system up-to-date.

Winlab First Impressions: d-Time 95 -- Cache In for a Speedy CD

By:
James E. Powell

Even quad-speed CD-Rom drives get a performance boost with d
Time 95. The utility works like a system caching program, using
your hard disk to store data read from a CD-ROM. Your hard
disk's speed will affect performance gains, but in my tests
using a 30MB cache-I netted an average 50 percent pickup.

Many CD-ROM-based programs install a few files and then run
the program from the CD-ROM. Performance is sluggish, but with
d-Time, your patience will no longer be sorely tested.

D-Time's monitor shows you how it's working by displaying the
percentage of "hits"-reads from the hard disk rather than from
the CD-ROM. My tests yielded greater gains with large files,
especially multimedia files. A "learn" mode tracks how you
use a particular CD-ROM, then stores this information in a
Timelog. The next time you use that CD-ROM, load its Timelog
and performance is automatically optimized.

The speed gains are d-Time's good news; its setup is not. The
setup routine first called a DOS program to run an animated
logo, then froze my system. I got further with tech support's
help, but my system hung up again after running Scandisk. It
was supposed to run Disk Defragmenter next, as a safeguard
before d-Time installed its files.

Once you get over the rough spots-and if you have 30MB or more
available for the cache-d-Time can make your CD drive hum.

Winlab First Impressions: Art-Scan Professional 3.95 -- Scant Effort for 
Swift Scans

By:
Hailey Lynne McKeefry

I've often wished that getting paper-based images into my PC
was as easy as getting them out. Art-Scan Professional simplifies
the document scanning process and, after I overcame some setup
difficulties, it provided me with a straightforward way of
moving images on paper off my desk and into my computer.

Art-Scan promises to work with more than 100 scanner engines,
including major manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, Microtek,
UMAX, Envisions, Epson and Relisys. But when I tried to use
it with an Agfa StudioScan flatbed scanner-which was on the
list of supported hardware-I ran into a jam because Agfa uses
a slightly different SCSI driver for this new model. Jetsoft
supplied replacement software with a bug fix, and I had no
problem loading the program. Art-Scan requires that you have
TWAIN-compatible image editing or graphics software such as
Adobe Photoshop or PageMaker, Corel Photo-Paint, Aldus PhotoStyler,
Fractal Design Painter or Caere OmniPage Professional.

The program's interface is simple and easy to use. In Auto-Mode,
all scanning options are set without user intervention; the
software determines the image type and configures the scanner
automatically. I just had to choose the type of original, either
film or photo. If you want to make your own setting adjustments,
you have a multitude of options, including scan mode, resolution,
size of the original and image range. You can scan color, gray
scale and line art, and you can choose to scan directly into .EPS 
or vector-based files without having to convert them separately
to PostScript. A Batch Scanning feature prompts for more pages
as each scan completes.

The simplicity and organized design of Art-Scan made scanning
simple enough that I quickly recovered from the stress caused
by my initial difficulties. In all, it was worth the work and
wait to get this program up and running.

Winlab First Impressions: Canon BJC-210 -- Bubbling with Color

By:
John Perry

Despite all the talk about the next generation's growing intimacy
with technology, I never realized there was a market for "cyber
Crayola" applications. The Canon BJC-210 color BubbleJet printer
brings color printing home to the family.

The BJC-210 is just about the smallest color printer I've seen,
measuring only 8.2 by 13.7 by 6.9 inches and weighing only
5.8 pounds.

Color output is quite good. The BJC-210 has a 360x360dpi resolution
and prints as fast as 0.27 pages per minute, at a cost per
page of 35 cents. For best printing results, coated paper is
a must. The vertical-feed paper tray holds 100 sheets. An application
bundled with the Canon Creative software allows you to make
heat transfers for T-shirts.

The BJC-210 ships with Canon Creative and Windows 3.x drivers,
and Win95 drivers will be available by the time you read this.
The Canon Creative package includes Sticker & Label Store,
Stationery Store by DogByte Development, Crayola Art by Micrografx
and Pattern Maker by HobbyWare. Swap out the color cartridge
for a black one, and you've got a black-and-white printer with
a printing resolution of 720x360dpi that's quite usable for
business.

As far as repairs go, a 2-year full warranty with InstantExchange
24-hour replacement offers you a new printer instantly should
yours break.

Winlab First Impressions: PaperMaster 2.0 -- Master the Paper Monster

By:
Cheryl Dominianni

At a snail's pace, we creep along toward the paperless office.
But if your patience is wearing thin, you don't have to wait
to tame your paper monster. PaperMaster 2.0 is personal paper
management software that, when coupled with a scanner, provides
instant access to information that was previously paper-based.
The program lets you file, find, fax, copy, edit, e-mail, form
fill and annotate digital documents.

PaperMaster uses an intuitive file cabinet metaphor. The cabinet
on the opening screen has some drawers already named, but you
can easily create new drawers and folders. You can customize
your cabinet with graphics and font colors. Drag-and-drop makes
moving drawers, folders and documents a snap, and a lock option
lets you restrict drawers with passwords.

PaperMaster accepts documents via scanner, fax modems, e-mail
and other Windows applications. You can scan documents directly
into the file cabinet using any TWAIN- or ISIS-compliant scanner.
The program installs the PaperMaster File Cabinet as a printer
driver, which simplifies inputting documents from Windows applications.
You can directly import image files in .TIF, .PCX, .BMP, .GIF
or JPEG formats. It's also possible to set the software so
that all incoming faxes are routed directly into PaperMaster's
Inbox.

Once a document is in your cabinet, you are able to fill in
a form for the doc and annotate the file with sticky notes.
You can also search for specific text (after using the Read
and Index command), and fax and e-mail the file. PaperMaster's
fax/copy tool can replace a dedicated fax and copier-a feature
sure to interest small-office users.

Version 2.0 enhancements include the ability to share cabinets
or take them on the road; support for color and gray-scale
documents; and an Inbox where you can store documents for later
filing, straightening and autocropping features. The ability
to fill in forms with a type text tool, and MAPI- and VIM-enabled
e-mail are also new.

PaperMaster is a versatile program with an intuitive interface
that can help you master the paper chase.

Winlab First Impressions: askSam 3.0 -- Play It Again, Sam

By:
Philip Albinus

Right when you thought you could come up for air in a sea of
information, along comes the Internet tidal wave. Before you
go under for the last time, give askSam 3.0 a look.

I tested a beta version of askSam and found its search engine
vastly improved. This fleet-footed application can search for
a word or text string in the blink of an eye. It also has new
features for working on the World Wide Web. HTML import and
export capabilities have been added to simplify organizing
Web information. Just find a Web page and save it to your hard
drive as an HTML file. AskSam 3.0 will open the file and preserve
the hyperlinks in bold-faced, colored type, and you can turn
the Web page into a searchable askSam database file. The Internet
Desktop section also offers predefined templates for managing
e-mail and newsgroup messages.

AskSam 3.0 ships with a set of clever applets called askSam
Office. The six apps include askSam files to track addresses,
notes, to-do items, faxes, memos and letters.

AskSam 3.0 is a 16-bit application that works well under Windows
95. The company says a 32-bit version will debut by mid-1996.
Until then, you won't be sacrificing anything with this powerful
and flexible program.

Even if you're a little fish in a sea of big businesses, you
can still project the spit-and-polish image of the big boys
with MyAdvancedBrochures 95. The program lets you create professional
looking business publications that cost a lot less than a trip
to the printer.

This 32-bit version of MyAdvancedBrochures has been tuned to
take advantage of Windows 95, including features like long
filenames, right mouse-button menus, and OLE drag-and-drop.
The program, which I tested in beta, also runs under Windows
NT.

Other new features simplify printing and mailing. A Mail Merge
Wizard walks you through creating mailing labels from a dBASE
IV, MyMailList or delimited ASCII file. In a few easy steps,
the mail merge is done, including any filtering.

The program also supports an increased number of preprinted
papers from a variety of vendors, including Beaver Prints,
Image Plus, Image Street, Paper Direct and InstaColor. In all,
this CD-ROM version supports 650 paper designs, from dual-
and trifold brochures, flyers, and letterhead to business cards
and newsletters. In many cases, MyAdvancedBrochures supports
paper designs across several formats (brochures, letterhead,
business cards and so forth) so all your documents can have
a consistent look and feel. There are also 14 designs that
you can print yourself and an option for plain paper for creating
your own designs. The CD supports about 1,000 clip-art images,
or you can import art in 13 graphics formats.

The newsletter design templates now include about 40 different
dualfold brochure options as well as 28 designs for fourfold
brochures that print on legal-sized paper. The previous version
supported only trifold designs. You still have the option of
adding reply or rotary cards, as well as space for a "send
to" or return address label.

MyAdvancedBrochures has maintained its easy-to-use interface
and clear toolbars, while adding more design choices. This
modestly priced program will more than pay for itself even
if you only use it a few times a year for promotional mailers.

Winlab First Impressions: Sejin Wireless Keyboard Model SPR-8630WP -- 
Look, Ma, No Wires

By:
James E. Powell

Having worked with Logitech wireless mice for a number of years,
I appreciate the way these peripherals keep my desktop free
of wires. Now Sejin offers a compact wireless keyboard that
can remove yet another cord from my desk.

The unit's infrared receiver plugs into your computer just like
any keyboard (there's an adapter for both PS/AT- and PS/2-sized
plugs). There are no special drivers to load: Windows 95-and,
presumably, Windows 3.x-recognizes the unit as just another
keyboard.

The keyboard itself is powered by two AAA batteries and can
be used within 16 feet of the receiver. The keyboard doesn't
have to be in exact line of sight, either; the unit works within
a 45-degree range.

Though all the letter and number keys are full-size, the function
and navigation keys are tiny by comparison. There's a numeric
keypad layout, available on several letter keys, that's accessible
by pressing the Fn key, just as on most laptops.

I like the feel of this quiet, 86-key keyboard. The product's
size (1 by 11.5 by 5.5 inches) is ideal. It's incredibly lightweight,
and it has adjustable tilt legs and nonskid rubber feet for
desktop use. But its best feature is what it doesn't have:
a wire.

Winlab First Impressions: First Aid 95 -- Snafu Sniffer Suggests Solutions

By:
James E. Powell

When all's not well with your Windows system, there is a doctor
in the house if you have a copy of First Aid 95. The utility
diagnoses problems and suggests remedies and, despite having
"95" as its surname, First Aid works for Windows 3.1, too.

If your multimedia system is in trouble, for example, First
Aid's diagnostics may suggest fixes such as replacing missing
drivers. If the necessary driver is tucked in the wrong folder,
you can move it with just a click on the AutoFix button. If
the driver can't be located, First Aid opens the appropriate
Control Panel Wizard.

First Aid examines the error your application returns and describes
the hitch in plain English. Then the program checks to see
if the condition is among the 10,000 in its knowledge base.
If it is, it sets out to look for the file the application
requires.

Running under Windows 95, 16-bit applications can still crash.
But if First Aid's Crash Guard is running in the background,
it can monitor the app and intercede to save your data if it
detects a GPF.

First Aid's Trim feature is like a selective uninstall. It removes
files related to an application's features you no longer use.
On the flip side, it can check to ensure that all the files
needed for a particular feature are in place.

But First Aid can be confusing. The manual refers to Crash Guard
by another name (Problem Monitor). And when Crash Guard starts,
it's not represented by a taskbar icon as are the other background
utilities. The manual also mentions a feature called Windows
Guardian, but there is no such screen.

Most disappointing, though, is First Aid's limited list of supported
applications. Not supporting the very latest version of a program
is reasonable, but not including support for mature programs
isn't. For example, First Aid can check Access 1.0 and 1.1,
but not version 2.0, which is more than a year old. However,
you can use the programs' Support Exchange to get updates from
the company's BBS, the Internet, CompuServe, Prodigy, MSN or
AOL.

Winlab First Impressions: Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5Si MX -- 
Workhorse Laser for Workgroup Printing

By:
Hailey Lynne McKeefry

Five thousand dollars may seem like a lot to pay for a laser
printer. However, the HP LaserJet 5Si MX packs in paper-handling,
output and networking features that make it worth the price.

This network powerhouse is built to handle the demands of a
large workgroup with ease and style. It is decked out with
two 500-sheet input paper trays and a 100-sheet multipurpose
tray that can handle 10 different sizes of printable media,
to make restocking paper a once-in-a-while job. You can also
add a whopping 2,000-sheet input tray (for $1,299) to bring
the total capacity to 3,100 sheets.

This speed demon whips out letter- and A4-sized documents at
24 pages per minute with a resolution of 600x600 dots per inch.
The unit weighs in at 99 pounds and measures 21.3 by 31.3 by
20.5 inches. It comes standard with 12MB of RAM, expandable
to 76MB. The LaserJet 5Si is rated for a duty cycle of 100,000
pages per month.

The printer's networking options are legion: They include 10Base2
and 10BaseT Ethernet and DIN-8 LocalTalk bi-directional interfaces,
as well as an HP MIO expansion slot. The unit supports just
about any network OS right out of the box. The included JetAdmin
software gives network managers real-time remote printer status
and diagnostic alerts. This is one printer you can share with
a large office and still not keep anyone waiting.

Winlab First Impressions: PowerDesk 1.0 -- Roll Your Own Desktop

By:
Joel T. Patz

I'm always looking for ways to make my work easier, so PowerDesk
is my kind of utility. It organizes my work tools and puts
them on my desktop within easy reach of a mouse click.

You can integrate the PowerDesk toolbar with Windows 95's taskbar
or use it as a separate window on your desktop. You place launch
buttons for specific files, folders or applications on the
toolbar, or use the DOS command box if you like to do things
the old-fashioned way. System monitors watch CPU usage, threads,
available memory, available disk space, and system, user and
GDI resources. You can specify how often you want the monitors
updated and display them as bars or moving graphs.

PowerDesk's multiview feature lets you switch among up to 16
virtual screens, which you customize by adjusting their color
and size, hotkeys and applications. System shortcuts to shut
down or restart your computer, restart Windows, log on as another
user or change screen resolution can also be added to the toolbar.
It's even possible to display up to seven clocks set for different
time zones.

Installed printers can be represented by icons on the toolbar
which can be used as shortcuts. Any item in your Start/Programs
list will be identified by a start button by PowerDesk and,
like everything else in the program, can be modified.

PowerDesk provides one-click access to drives, files and folders.
Menu choices make managing zip files quick and simple. The
customizable toolbar's buttons make it easy to rename files,
change icon sizes, call up a detail view of the file list,
and arrange file lists by name, extension, size, date and type.
Other file operations, such as cut, copy, paste, undo and delete,
are just as straightforward. The DOS command line at the bottom
of the ExplorerPlus screen is a real timesaver.

PowerDesk's intuitive interface, seamless integration with Windows
95 and easy customization make it a timely addition to a busy
user's toolkit.

Winlab First Impressions: Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit for Windows 95 -- 
This Doctor Makes House Calls

By:
Rich Castagna

There is a doctor in the house, and he has his finger on your
PC's pulse. Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus Toolkit is a healthy dose
of preventive medicine that will help keep your Windows 95
system free of crippling-or even just plain annoying-viruses.

I tested the beta version of this cure-all kit. It has several
components, including WinGuard, which you can set to run at
Win95's start-up. WinGuard lurks in the background and checks
the health of files as you access them. You can also manually
run a virus check from Dr. Solomon's dialog box and scan any
drive-including your floppy-for over 7,000 known malicious
critters.

The good doctor also provides an online encyclopedia of about
300 common viruses. It's interesting reading in itself, and
when Dr. Solomon nabs a nasty before it can put the hurt on
your hard disk, you can look it up and see what peril you just
escaped. Besides a description of each bug's evil intent, the
encyclopedia explains how it works and if there are any known
variations.

A Scheduler lets you set up regular scans that will kick off
without your intervention. And if your reading preferences
tend toward hexadecimal, you can select Inspect from the Advanced
menu and peer into the darkest recesses of a file or disk.

Dr. Solomon's past releases have been effective vaccinations
against destructive viruses. With the amount of downloading
and file swapping we do these days, the need for effective
detection is greater than ever.

Winlab First Impressions: Mosaic in a Box for Windows 95 -- 
Sleek Intro to the Net Set

By:
Julie R. Blumenfield

Neophyte Netters, take note: Mosaic in a Box for Windows 95
is the perfect Internet browser for beginners.

Installing Mosaic in a Box creates a program group on the Start
menu with a dialer app, 32-bit browser, mail client, graphic
viewer, the program's help system and an account-creation utility.
Newcomers will also appreciate the World Wide Web 95 Tour,
an Internet introduction. CompuServe Wallet (an Internet payment
service that uses CheckFree) and an access-number phone book
round out the offerings.

This 32-bit version of Mosaic is considerably faster than its
predecessor. The browser is supposed to conform to the HTML
3.0 standard, but some 3.0 enhancements like tables and text
wraps around graphics weren't supported. It does, however,
support Win95 conventions such as context menus, and also provides
a configurable hotlist and viewing options such as the ability
to change the hyperlink display color.

Mosaic's newsgroup feature is anemic. Your only option is to
enter the name of a newsgroup-there's no master list or search
capability.

The mail function, on the other hand, is intuitive and quick.
And the file-viewer utility is so good that it alone might
be worth the price.

Mosaic's easy operation and detailed help screens make it perfect
for Internet newcomers.

Winlab First Impressions: Virtus WalkThrough 2.5 -- 
The Shape of Things to Come 

By:
Lynn Ginsberg

As you travel about the virtual worlds in the Web's cyberspace,
you might begin to believe that Columbus was wrong: This world
is flat. But the Web is becoming a more inhabitable space,
thanks to programs such as Virtus WalkThrough, which supports
the latest Internet protocol of 3-D VRML modeling. VRML (virtual
reality modeling language) lets developers create 3-D models
for the Internet. These models can be navigated by multiple
participants and hyperlinked to other 3-D worlds or HTML documents.

Virtus WalkThrough is a natural for VRML development, with its
innovative approach to implementing navigable 3-D scenes and
environments. WalkThrough's strength is its straightforward
set of tools, which you use to create complex 3-D worlds for
the Internet using a relatively humble PC rather than a high
powered workstation.

The process for creating WalkThrough's VRML environments is
simple. First, you use the program to create your 3-D scene.
Next, you map out which objects within the scene will be "hot
spots" for linking to other HTML Web pages or another VRML
document. Once you've chosen these hot spots, you fill in a
dialog box to attach a VRML anchor to the object, which designates
the URL link. After assigning all of the anchors to objects,
you export your 3-D model to VRML using a File menu option.

That's all there is to it.

I found the hot-spot and linking process extremely easy to follow
considerably less challenging than creating the 3-D scene itself.
This WalkThrough version also supports stereoscopic viewing
hardware which, if you have virtual reality equipment, lets
you interact even more realistically within a 3-D scene.

While it's easy to convert 3-D environments to VRML with WalkThrough,
navigating a 3-D environment online is still a far cry from
reality given current modem, line and hardware limitations.
Unless, of course, that reality is really, really slow. Until
the supporting hardware and communications infrastructure is
in place, the worlds created in Virtus will demand as much
patience as vision from the virtual traveler.

Winlab First Impressions: EasyPhoto 2.0 -- Dress Up Docs with Digital Pics

By:
Jim Forbes

It's easy to be image-conscious with EasyPhoto 2.0, a graphics
and scanning application that makes it a snap to add photos
or pictures to reports, proposals and other documents.

EasyPhoto is available on a CD-ROM or bundled with a scanner
($249). This release incorporates features that improve its
versatility. It supports photos with enhanced resolutions of
up to 1200dpi. In addition, its ClearPrint technology has been
enhanced to optimize output for specific printers. The program
works with new color ink jet printers from such vendors as
Hewlett-Packard, Epson and Canon, and it supports OLE 2.0.

EasyPhoto is easier to use than its predecessor, and the photo
scanner is faster. These improvements help non-graphics professionals
create great-looking documents with text that wraps around
color photos. Another key benefit of EasyPhoto is the ability
to print the graphics-enhanced documents using a relatively
inexpensive color ink jet printer.

Other programs provide similar features, but EasyPhoto is-right
now-the best solution available for dressing up documents with
eye-catching graphics.

Winlab First Impressions: ArtMedia Monitors TC1864 and TG1882 -- 
Practically Perfect Pictures

By:
Joel T. Patz

Perfection is rarely encountered in life, but two new monitors
from ArtMedia, the TC1864 and the TG1882, come close. They're
also competitively priced, considering their performance.

Both these Trinitron CRT monitors provide an approximate 16
inch diagonal, conductive silica-coated viewing area. The 42
pound TC1864 offers 1280x1024 maximum resolution, with an optimal
resolution of 1024x768 at 75Hz and 0.25mm grill pitch (Trinitron's
quasi-equivalent to dot pitch). Its horizontal scan frequency
falls within a 31kHz to 64kHz range, and the vertical scan
frequency lies between 50Hz and 120Hz. Hidden behind a flip
down panel on the monitor's front, the digital control buttons
for the TC1864 allow you to adjust brightness and contrast,
horizontal and vertical centering and size, and color temperature.
You can also correct for pincushioning and rotation.

The maximum resolution for the TG1882 is 1600x1280, the optimal
being 1280x1024 at 75Hz. It supports horizontal and vertical
scanning frequencies between 29kHz and 82kHz and 50Hz and150Hz,
respectively. Located on the monitor's lower edge, the TG1882's
controls include plus and minus contrast and brightness buttons,
and a Select button joined to a series of tiny indicators.
You can adjust centering, picture size, tilt and horizontal
pincushion, convergence and color temperature. The TG1882 weighs
in at 49 pounds and uses a BNC connector cable.

Both monitors, which measure no more than a space-saving 18
inches in height. width or depth, are automatically degaussed
on start-up and comply with MPR II standards. In compliance
with power-saving guidelines, each supports three levels of
operation with the appropriate video card.

I ran each monitor through its paces using DisplayMate for Windows
(Sonera Technologies, 800-932-6323) to check for focus, convergence,
color, resolution and other characteristics. The results were
excellent. I found no evidence of moir patterns and a complete
absence of distortion on both test screens, although the TG1882
did have a sharper picture. They were both, quite nearly, perfect.

Winlab First Impressions: AcerNote Light -- Bantamweight Book 
Won't Break Your Budget

By:
Jim Forbes

Value-class machines provide the basic functionality most of
us need for mobile computing. I recently saw a preproduction
version of one such machine, the AcerNote Light model 352.
It ships with a 10.4-inch dual-scan passive-matrix display,
a 75MHz 80486 DX4 processor, a 420MB hard disk, an internal
3.5-inch floppy disk drive, a single Type II PCMCIA socket,
one serial port, one parallel port, a self-contained infrared
transceiver and a touchpad pointing device.

The internal battery consistently powered the machine for 2.25
to 2.75 hours. Recharging the batteries takes about 3 hours
with the power off. Optional lithium ion batteries should be
available by the time you read this.

The notebook's dual-scan passive-matrix screen is bright, with
a diagonal width of 10.4 inches, but it has a narrow viewing
angle. The AcerNote Light is smaller than most notebooks. It's
1.7 by 11.7 by 8.2 inches and has a travel weight (including
its small recharger) of 5.6 pounds. Windows 95 is standard,
as is a card game, a personal organizer and software utilities.

The AcerNote Light's Wintune 95 benchmark results were good
for a 75MHz 486: CPU, 44.6MIPS; FPU, 15.5MFLOPS; video, 2.07Mpixels
per second; and 4.34MB per second data-transfer rate for the
hard disk.

I wouldn't hesitate to send one away with a college student,
or to carry it day in and day out in my book bag.

Winlab First Impressions: Visioneer PaperPort Vx -- Port in a Paper Storm

By:
Rich Castagna

Imagine a machine that sucks stacks of paper off your desk and
tucks them onto your hard disk. And imagine a program that
lets you do just about anything you want with those digitized
documents. Now turn off your imagination and turn on the PaperPort
Vx.

The new scanner/document manager combo offers a slightly revised
look and a slew of small but useful enhancements. On the outside,
the 3.75- by 12- by 2.5-inch scanner is a little sleeker than
its predecessor, but its beauty isn't only skin deep. A new
chip provides 8-bit scanning for up to 256 shades of gray.
And it's still quick-taking only a lickety-split 5 or 6 seconds
to scan a full page.

Depending on the material you plan to scan, you can switch among
PaperPort's six modes for scanning text or images. For each
setting, there's a description of the level of quality to expect
and the resulting file's relative size.

PaperPort wakes up when you slip a document into the scanner.
Once the scan is complete, the Page screen pops up, where you
can adjust the image or add annotations in the form of sticky
notes, arrows or freehand lines. For skewed images, you use
a new alignment tool to turn the image until it lines up.

The Desktop screen shows the scanned pages and lets you drop
them into folders or shuffle them into stacks. A slider bar
makes it easy to flip through the stack, and the Browse button
lists the items in the selected folder. You can also add a
descriptive header record to a scan, which-like the sticky
notes-is searchable.

PaperPort searches your disk for installed apps and for each
one it recognizes, it creates a link and a big button at the
bottom of the Desktop screen. You can drag scanned pages to
the buttons to launch the applications. When applicable, PaperPort
first runs the page through OmniPage Lite's OCR software before
starting the program.

There's no easier way to get from paper to pixels.

Winlab First Impressions: Sharp PC-8800 -- Easy on the Eyes (and Ears)

By:
Michelle A. Tyrrell

With Pentiums now ubiquitous, great deals abound on systems
with slower processors. The Sharp PC-8800 notebook computer,
with its 486DX4/75 processor, is one example.

The PC-8800 ships with 8MB of RAM (expandable to 32MB) and a
320MB hard disk (upgradable to 500MB). It has 1MB of video
memory, 32-bit VESA local-bus video, and 16-bit sound with
built-in stereo speakers and microphone. The keyboard is comfortable,
and the 10.4-inch, 800x600 resolution dual-scan SVGA screen
is easy on the eyes. A GlidePoint Trackpad makes all the difference
for comfort and accuracy.

The PC-8800 comes with an infrared port, allowing the user to
communicate wirelessly with infrared-equipped systems, PDAs
and printers. It has a nickel metal hydride "Smart" battery
and dual-battery capability for extended travel.

The floppy disk drive is on the front of the unit, while the
back houses the usual complement of ports. The PCMCIA slot
holds two Type II cards or one Type III card.

The model I tested was running Windows 3.1. The Word 6.0 macro
executed in 110 seconds, while the Excel 5.0 macro finished
in 56 seconds. The CPU scored 39.5MIPS and 8.2MFLOPS, hard
disk access was 1.826MB per second, and the video system racked
up 3.068Mpixels per second. The battery delivered 2 hours usage.

The PC-8800 measures 2 by 11.6 by 8.8 inches and weighs 6.2
pounds. MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, America Online, CompuServe and
CheckFree were preinstalled.

computers than for value-class machines. The TI Extensa 455T
may change all that. It's a new 75MHz DX4 486-based notebook
that muscles into the notebook market's action area-systems
that cost less than $2,400.

The Extensa is manufactured for TI by Acer and is almost identical
to the AcerNote Light, also reviewed in First Impressions this
month. Standard equipment includes a single Type II PCMCIA
(PC Card) slot, one parallel, one serial and two PS/2 ports,
14MB of

RAM expandable to 32MB, a 3.5-inch (removable) floppy disk drive,
accelerated graphics and a full-sized palm rest with an integrated
GlidePoint pointing device.

The Extensa allows you to plug optional lithium ion batteries
or an optional Type III PC Card socket into a module that normally
holds the floppy disk drive. The unit includes a small, easily
connected port replicator, weighs under 6 pounds and measures
1.7 by 11.7 by 8.2 inches. Duracell makes the primary power
cell. I was able to get up to three hours' use between charges
with only moderate power conservation. The power supply is
small, measuring approximately 1 by 4 by 2 inches.

The 9.5-inch active-matrix color screen should be adequate for
most users' needs, although I wouldn't recommend the Extensa
455T for presentation graphics.

The Extensa 455T ships with Windows 95, Microsoft Works, Lotus
Organizer and other software. My test unit had less than 102MB
free on its 340MB hard disk.

The TI Extensa 455T's Win95 Wintune benchmark results were 45MIPS,
15MFLOPS, 1.56Mpixels per second for the video, and 4.36MB
per second data-transfer rate for the hard disk. These results
are slightly better than those of other 75MHz DX4 machines
I've tested, although the Cirrus Logic-based video is slow.
This machine took 72 seconds to complete our 32-bit Excel macro
and 154 seconds to run our 32-bit Word macro.

Texas Instruments has stuffed a lot of value in a small case
with the Extensa 455T. With the optional lithium ion battery,
it should compete well with much more expensive models.

Winlab First Impressions: Apple Color LaserWriter 12/600 PS -- 
Appetizing Apple Offers Crisp, Colorful Pages

By:
Hailey Lynne McKeefry

Apple has long been a desktop publishing leader, so it's no
surprise that the company's newest color laser printer is a
technological tour de force. What's surprising is how nicely
this Apple unit fit into my Windows setup.

The Apple Color LaserWriter 12/600 PS is for workgroups with
any combination of Macintosh, Power Macintosh, Windows and
UNIX computers. It comes standard with support for most network
protocols.

Setup was simple, although I did have to install a number of
pieces including four toner cartridges (cyan, magenta, yellow
and black), a photoconductor drum, an oil canister and an empty
toner collection box. The printer's control panel indicates
which toner cartridge is low, and which portions of the unit
need maintenance.

The LaserWriter 12/600 outputs at 600x600-dot-per-inch resolution.
It ships with 39 PostScript fonts, 64 TrueType fonts and 12MB
of RAM. The colors produced are bright and vibrant even on
plain, uncoated paper. It prints at 12 pages per minute in
black and white and 3ppm in color. You can also print color
transparencies at 1ppm.

The printer ships with one 250-sheet cassette, a 100-sheet multipurpose
tray; an additional 250-sheet tray is also available.

Toner cartridges for the unit cost $119 for black and $139 for
cyan, magenta and yellow. Apple estimates that the cost is
3 cents per page at 5 percent black coverage and 13 cents per
page at 20 percent color coverage.

Winlab First Impressions: AppleVision 1710AV -- Multimedia MacMonitor

By:
Hailey Lynne McKeefry

The split between the Apple Macintosh and the Windows PC has
traditionally been as stringently observed as the separation
between church and state. The walls separating the two are
breaking down, but they aren't rubble yet. I found that while
the Apple Vision 1710AV multimedia monitor had the traditionally
high price tag of Macintosh products, it lacked the ease-of
use of a VGA monitor.

First, the unit requires an adapter (included) so that it can
plug into a Windows PC. Second, there is no Windows version
of the AppleVision utilities. On-screen controls allowed the
adjustment

of geometry, brightness, contrast and color temperature. However,
I was repeatedly unable to get the pincushioning and convergence
exactly right.

On the bright side, the AppleVision's flat screen, combined
with an antiglare coating, made it very easy on my eyes. The
17-inch Trinitron CRT provides a healthy 16.1-inch diagonal
viewable image and a 0.26mm stripe pitch. For PCs, it supports
resolutions from 640x480 to 1280x1024. You can use an ergonomic
75Hz refresh rate at any of those resolutions.

A set of stereo speakers mounted at the unit's bottom provides
good-quality sound, while a directional microphone sits embedded
at the top of the monitor. These features add some size to
the unit, which measures 19.7 by 15.8 by 17.6 inches and weighs
60 pounds.

Winlab First Impressions: Robotech Cobra XLT P133 Multimedia System -- 
Jazzy 133 for After-5 Fun

By:
Philip Albinus

Now's your chance to get off the couch and become a bona fide
PC potato. The Robotech Cobra XLT is a fast and furious 133MHz
Pentium system that offers more video thrills than a Schwarzenegger
action flick.

The Robotech Cobra XLT isn't just a speedy PC; it's a home entertainment
system. Though it lacks a modem and network card, there's video
galore. The Robotech Cobra ships with the Jazz Multimedia Jakarta
MPEG Video Graphics Accelerator card with 2MB of DRAM. The
unit also features the Jazz Multimedia Port of Entry card,
a cable-ready tuner that puts your TV and Sega, Nintendo and
3DO games within Windows. You can also watch videotapes from
your VCR or camcorder. Unfortunately, Jazz Multimedia was still
finishing its 32-bit drivers at presstime, so portions of our
video testing were incomplete.

You will certainly need full-blown sound to accompany all this
flashy video. The Robotech Cobra ships with a Sound Blaster
compatible Cobra Wave Table audio card that delivers 16-bit
sound. The unit also offers a pair of Yamaha YST-M10 powered
monitor speakers.

The PC came installed with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and MS
DOS 6.22, and was loaded with 16MB of RAM and a 1GB hard drive.
Installing Windows 95 was a breeze from the Panasonic quad
speed CD-ROM drive. A Robotech spokesman said the company will
be shipping Cobras with Win95 installed by the time you read
this.

The system's monitor is its only drawback. The 17-inch screen
has a 0.26mm dot pitch, but its performance was only adequate.
This PC has spectacular multimedia peripherals; it deserves
an equally impressive monitor.

The Cobra scored 243MIPS and 76MFLOPS on our WINDOWS Magazine
Wintune 95 benchmark tests, about average for a 133MHz Pentium.
Its video score of 2.4Mpixels per second and uncached hard
drive data transfer rate of 3.4MB were disappointing, however.
It posted equally lackluster times of 88 seconds to complete
our Word 7.0 macro and 62 seconds for the Excel macro. But
if it's wall-to-wall video goodies you want, the Robotech Cobra
can flex plenty of multimedia muscle.

Winlab First Impressions: Packard Bell Multimedia Corner Computer -- 
Angular PC Is a Niche Product

By:
Cynthia Morgan

You know PCs have become household appliances when space-saving
designer models come along. The Packard Bell Multimedia Corner
PC is just that, with dual drive sections that split off at
90-degree angles to fit a desktop corner.

A 133MHz Pentium system with 16MB of EDO RAM, 1.6GB hard disk
and PCI video with 1MB of video RAM, the Corner PC is also
a home entertainment center. Packard Bell uses all three ISA
slots and fills them with a combo voice mail/14.4Kbps modem
sound card, an FM radio adapter and PBTV4, an integrated cable
TV card. An included remote control handily doubles as a mouse.
Packard Bell gets high marks for its user-friendly welcoming
tutorial, built around a family living room metaphor.

As with a TV, you don't ever want to remove the cover. Packard
Bell takes seven pages to explain how to remove it, and it's
not easy, especially since it's partially wired to the chassis.

Unfortunately, the Corner PC scores on the low end for a 133MHz
system. WINDOWS Magazine's Wintune benchmarks rated the processor
at 230MIPS, with on-target 77MFLOPS for floating point but
a disappointing video score at 4.3Mpixels per second. Uncached
disk operation transfers data at 3MB per second.

At $3,398, the Corner PC is a full-featured value for the casual
home user. For faster performance and do-it-yourself serviceability,
however, you might want to look elsewhere.

Winlab First Impressions: Zenith Z-Station GT 590MM -- Lots of Vroom, 
Little Room

By:
Cynthia Morgan

Zenith Data Systems is known for stuffing everything possible
onto its motherboards. So I was surprised to find that the
company's design philosophy had taken a different tack with
its new Z-Station GT 590MM. Instead of cramming the motherboard
to the gills, this multimedia desktop fills all three ISA slots
with network, sound and modem cards, so don't plan on adding
more.

The Hayes Accura 144B fax modem, Creative Labs Sound Blaster
16 and SMC network card leave just two PCI slots free. Of course,
with 16MB of RAM, a 256KB level 2 cache, a 1.2GB EIDE hard
drive, a quad-speed Toshiba IDE CD-ROM and built-in S3 Trio
32-bit PCI graphics adapter with 2MB of video memory, you won't
lack for much. Moving sound and communications off the motherboard
eases future upgrading.

However, tech support may call this desktop a service headache,
despite the fact that internal components are easy to find.
Although it's wider than most slimline desktop PCs-17 instead
of the usual 14 to 16 inches-there's not much room inside.
You'll probably need to remove cards and/or drives to make
hardware changes. The four filled SIMM sockets crowd out a
possible fourth ISA slot, and drive bays restrict one ISA and
one PCI slot to short-length cards.

WINDOWS Magazine's Wintune benchmarks clocked this CPU doing
164MIPS, while floating-point operations moved along at 52MFLOPS,
a little higher than average for a 90MHz Pentium. The unit
showed lackluster hard-drive performance, though with a 1.8MB
per-second uncached data-transfer rate. Video was also middling,
at 6.7Mpixels per second.

The GT 590MM's start-up screens offer extensive system and support
information, but the manual is sometimes confusing when it
comes to installing Windows 95 drivers. The price includes
sound, support and modem utilities, plus Internet software
and a copy of Symantec's Norton Navigator and Norton Antivirus
for Windows 95.

If you're more interested in using a PC than in tinkering inside
its case, you'll find the Z-Station GT 590MM is a solid performer.

Winlab First Impressions: Maximus P-133 -- Mini Tower of Power

By:
David Gabel

Maybe I've just become a jaded New Yorker. I approach each review
I undertake with skepticism. I did not think, for example,
that I was going to like the Maximus P-133 desktop system.

I was wrong.

I tested this computer in my office, which is jam-packed with
review products, and was therefore happy for the space-saving
mini-tower construction. The included 15-inch MAG InnoVision
monitor is similarly space-efficient, while maintaining picture
clarity and good color. It took about 2 hours for me to get
the computer unpacked and set up.

The P-133 performs. The low-level Wintune 95 benchmarks gave
me 243MIPS, disk speed of 3.4MB per second (uncached) and video
speed (from an ATI PCI video card) of 7.5Mpixels per second.
You won't catch this PC napping. The Microsoft Word 7.0 macro
ran in 18 seconds, while the Excel 7.0 macro executed in 13
seconds.

I do have some minor quibbles with this system: The case is
secured by Phillips-head screws, which are less convenient
than the thumbscrews that some companies are using. I didn't
like the Chicony keyboard, which had little tactical or audible
feedback. In addition, printer and comm ports are supplied
on an expansion card, leaving only one ISA slot free. And if
you need to install more than a network interface card, it
has to be PCI.

But I can live with those. My initial misgivings proved unfounded;
this is a nice machine.

Connectivity: Collabra Share 2.0 -- Enterprise Wise

By:
Jeffrey Sloman

Groupware is a product category that has taken time to come
of age. The long maturation is due mostly to pioneer products
that were too big for all but the largest organizations. But
thanks to groupware applications like Collabra Share 2.0, you
don't have to be a Fortune 500 company to reap the productivity
benefits that enhanced communications promises.

Collabra offers two versions of Share, a workgroup edition that
makes files on a central server sharable and a full-fledged
client/server edition. The client/server version is more appropriate
for larger installations that require a multiple-site setup.

Installing Share is straightforward, but you should first read
the manual's excellent section on planning. For a multiple
site configuration, you designate one site as the initial installation
site before you add the other locations using the Setup program's
connect option. A network installation takes about 10 minutes.

Once that's done, workstation software is installed from the
server by network users or the system administrator. You can
install the client programs on local drives or run them from
the server. Installing the client software from the network
is a snap.

Share provides threaded discussions within forums-similar to
the participant areas offered by commercial online services.
Each forum focuses on a specific topic, and threading keeps
the topic's messages and replies logically connected.

Compared with simple mailing-list discussions, which tend to
be serial, the threaded-message approach can handle nonlinear
interchanges adeptly. If an interesting-but tangential-discussion
arises from the main topic, it can be continued without disrupting
the original direction. And because everyone in a forum can
see all of the messages, it's easier for participants to keep
track of what's going on.

Share's forums are, in turn, organized into libraries. This
hierarchical structure makes it easy to perform global actions
on large sets of topics and messages. For example, if you want
to search for items that contain a particular word or phrase,
you can apply the search to an entire library rather than having
to search each forum separately.

A Share forum can have a designated moderator, who reviews and
approves documents submitted to the forum before making them
available to the rest of the group. The moderator can thus
help keep discussions to the point or defuse potentially controversial
topics. Another option allows anonymous contributions, which
is ideal for encouraging people to engage freely in discussions
of sensitive topics.

For the system administrator, Share offers excellent enterprise
features. The program's user list-called the Registry-is based
on your e-mail system's user list, so it's easy to maintain.
Share works with MAPI or VIM mail systems such as Microsoft
Mail, Exchange, Novell Groupwise and Lotus cc:Mail. Mail Agent,
an add-on product, allows the transfer of forum traffic to
a simple e-mail address.

Share is also highly configurable. You can choose to let all
users have access to the administrator's tools, or you can
implement stringent security policies. The system administrator
can select the level of control appropriate to the organization.
The client/ server version offers full forum replication across
multiple sites. A scheduling function facilitates the process.

Collabra Share 2.0 is a great solution for e-mail users who
want to step up to groupware. It offers the advantages of solid
groupware features without the hassles of more complex systems,
and its scalability means that you're unlikely to outgrow it.

Connectivity: OnTime Enterprise for NetWare 3.0 -- Well-Appointed Scheduler

By:
Jeffery Sloman

OnTime has been around since the days DOS outdueled Windows
in the software wars. The newest version, which I tested in
beta, faces stiff competition from a much-improved Microsoft
Schedule+. But OnTime's maturity shows, and it could become
the standard against which other scheduling programs are measured.

OnTime's strength is its true client/server architecture, which
offers enterprise-worthy features that can't be matched by
peer-to-peer products. This architecture enhances OnTime's
performance, and the program's functionality-including single
point multiserver configuration-makes administration much easier.
OnTime Enterprise for NetWare 3.0 runs on a NetWare file server
and takes full advantage of the existing network user database
to make adding new users a snap.

The program uses Novell's industry-standard, high-performance
Btrieve record manager to maintain its database. The shipping
version of the server product will be NetWare 4.x-certified,
but my tests were conducted under NetWare 3.11.

Installation of the server software is complex but not particularly
difficult, thanks to the included installation checklist. If
you haven't run client/server applications on your NetWare
server before, you should pay particular attention to the section
in the manual that details file versions. It's important that
your NetWare system is up-to-date. The OnTime package includes
a NetWare Btrieve update disk.

Most of this version's enhancements are on the client side.
OnTime Enterprise manages to strike a balance between adding
new features and maintaining ease of use. For example, the
new client interface eliminates many dialog boxes by offering
in-place editing for appointments.

You can select time periods directly on the grids that are used
to show appointments. The dialog box for editing appointments
and tasks is now non-modal-that is, it no longer changes depending
upon whether you are the person who created the appointment
or a proposed attendee.

All appointment and task activities are in a single, tabbed
dialog, and you can open more than one calendar at a time.

OnTime Enterprise's interface was quite complete in the beta
software, although some of its underpinnings were still under
construction. The shipping product will offer Windows 95 support
for the client. Campbell Services says the final product will
let an administrator designate a resource-such as a conference
room-as an entity that can be scheduled. Also promised are
new security features that will, for example, allow certain
users to view the details of a calendar but not to modify anything.

OnTime's new interface makes it much easier to use. For example,
everything related to an appointment can be set in one place.
First, you set a date by picking it directly from a calendar.
VCR-like controls make finding a particular month quick and
easy. The time and duration of the appointment can be set using
a timeline control. You can then assign a priority to the appointment
and add a reminder alarm.

Appointments can be displayed in three views: daily, weekly
or monthly. You can edit an appointment from any of these views.
All three views have some nice components, including a status
bar that displays current date and time, and the number of
outstanding appointments that others have scheduled for you.
To the right, a three-month calendar provides easy access to
future or past dates. The daily and weekly views also have
to-do lists with prioritization and completion check boxes.

Current OnTime users will be pleased with this excellent upgrade.
If you're shopping for a true enterprisewide group-scheduling
package, OnTime Enterprise merits your attention.

Cover Story: Eight Ways to Work in Windows 95 -- After studying the work
habits of dozens of Win95 users, we identified eight basic
PC personalities. Which best suits your computing style?

By:
Mike Elgan

Some say the best thing about Windows 95 is its 32-bit architecture.
Others claim Plug and Play is the operating system's hottest
feature. But it's the Win95 user interface that beats them
all. There are so many different ways to launch programs and
load applications-and switch from one to another-that you can
easily customize Win95 to suit your personal work style. We
did some field research to identify the myriad ways users work
with the new interface. We surveyed readers and staffers, and
secretly observed the habits of random Win95 point-and-clickers,
peering through office windows and over the shoulders of every
user we could find. Our findings helped us identify eight Win95
computing personalities. Each has a scientific name: Keyboard

Quickie, Mouse Maniac, Command Line Commander, Shortcut Showoff,
Start Menu Maven, Folder Fanatic, The Explorer and last (and
definitely least) The Minimalist.

But you probably know them as Carl, Mary, Colin-you may even
recognize yourself among our personalities. To give you a firsthand
look at how each works, we'll let the experts speak for themselves.
Then think about how you can adapt their on-the-job routines
to your own work style.

Take it away, Carl.

Carl the 'Keyboard Quickie'

We spend fortunes on Windows PCs that are so fast users can't
keep up with them. That's why the best way to work is the fastest
way to work, and the fastest way-hands down-is with a keyboard.
Nothing beats ripping through applications with eyes on the
monitor and hands on the keys. No fumbling for the mouse. Less
chance of carpal tunnel syndrome.

The downside, of course, is that we have to learn the keystrokes.
But this is easy, thanks to my one-step program: Unplug your
mouse for a month. At the end of that time, you'll know Win95's
keystrokes like the back of your CTS-free hand. (If you don't
want to go cold turkey, unplug the mouse from your laptop only.)

Here's the scoop on how to be a Win95 Keyboard Quickie.

Coolswitching in Windows 3.x was great, but in Win95 it's even
better. You probably already know how to coolswitch (hold down
the Alt key, then repeatedly press the Tab key).Win95 shows
you all the running icons as you coolswitch through them. Because
you can see your target application coming, you can get it
on the screen faster.

Here are a couple of neat coolswitching tricks you can try:
Press Alt+Shift+Tab to go backward (you can also do this in
the middle of a normal coolswitch). Or press Esc in the middle
of a coolswitch to bail out.

Here's a bonus tip for you Keyboard Quickies who want the fastest
possible task-switching. When you coolswitch, the first application
or folder selected is the last one you had open. If that's
the one you want, just press Alt+Tab and let go immediately.
The icons won't even come up-you'll instantly switch to the
app or folder you had open.

Then there's the Win95 power-user's coolswitch: Alt+Esc. This
keystroke instantly takes you from one open application or
folder to the next. Try it!

There are several other new or essential keystrokes in Win95.
Any Keyboard Quickie worth his or her salt should know the
important ones:

F2: Rename

F3: Launch Find

F4: Drop down the "Go to a different folder" menu on the folder
toolbar

F5: Refresh

Alt+F4: Close current application (if the desktop is the current
app, Win95 shuts down)

Ctrl+F4: Close current document but leave the application open

Alt+Enter: Bring up Properties dialog

Another great new Win95 keyboard enhancement is the application
of the Cut, Copy and Paste metaphors to files and folders.
You already know that in a word processor or other text-based
application, pressing Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V cuts, copies
and pastes, respectively. In Win95, these techniques can also
be applied to files and folders.

'Mouse Maniac' Mary

Ha! Get with it, Carl. This is 1996. Graphical computing isn't
about arcane keystrokes or commands that change with each application.
Haven't you heard? DOS is dead! Graphical computing is about
intuitively navigating the interface by pointing and clicking.
Using Windows without a mouse is like eating without utensils.
It's out of date and just isn't done in polite company.

Win95 is a Mouse Maniac's dream system. Unlike Windows 3.x and
previous versions, which used just one of your mouse buttons
(might as well use a Mac), Win95 makes good use of both mouse
buttons.

Every object on the desktop sports a Context menu that includes,
among other things, the all-important Properties dialog. You
can bring up the Context menu of any item by right-clicking
on it. Right-click on the Recycle Bin to empty it. Right-click
on the taskbar to configure it or minimize all open applications.
Right-click on the desktop or inside open folders to arrange
or view icons differently. Right-click on files to print them,
create shortcuts to them and mail them using the Send To command.
Right-click on everything.

When you drag and drop files or folders, get in the habit of
using the right mouse button. It'll give you the option to
move, copy or create a shortcut.

Win95 sports some drag-and-drop enhancements that all Mouse
Maniacs should know about. For example, if you're in the middle
of a drag and change your mind, just press the Esc key.

Mousing in Win95 is enhanced not only by the right mouse button,
but also by keystroke/mouse combinations. When you hold down
the Shift key while dumping something into the Recycle Bin,
Win95 deletes it. When you hold down the Ctrl key while double
clicking on a folder icon, Windows temporarily reverses your
settings for how folders should open. For instance, you can
set Win95 to open a new, separate folder each time you double
click on a folder (select View/Options from the folder menu,
then click on the Browsing Option of your choice). If you hold
down the Ctrl key, you'll open the folder in the same window.

You can also use keyboard/mouse combinations to enhance your
ability to select files and folders. In Explorer, you can select
all items from the top of a list down to your target folder
by holding down the Shift key, then clicking on the file or
folder at the bottom of the batch you want selected. Or click
on any file or folder, hold the Shift key and click on another
file or folder to select both items and everything between
them. To select any combination of items, hold down the Ctrl
key, then click on the files and folders you want.

Once you've made your selections, you can right-click on any
of them and choose an action from the Context menu that will
affect them all.

If you want to launch an application that needs switches or
other command-line parameters, you can use drag-and-drop to
get Win95 to type the path and filename for you. Click on the
Start button and select Run. Then drag the application and
drop it onto the Run command line. You can do the same thing
with the MS-DOS Prompt. Once the path and filename are there,
all you have to do is type in the parameters.

Colin the 'Command Line Commander'

DOS is dead, huh? Wanna race? I can type WORDPAD in the MS-DOS
Prompt, press the Enter key and type "The quick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dog" in WordPad before you even find the WordPad
applet on the Start menu or by navigating folders.

Instead of killing the command-line interface, Win95 gives it
new life. In older versions of Windows, you could launch only
DOS applications from the command line, but Win95 lets you
use the command line to launch Windows applications and open
folders in Windows. Just type the filename (don't worry about
the extension) and press Enter to launch applications.

In addition to its new ability to launch Win95 apps and its
old ability to act on DOS commands, the MS-DOS Prompt adds
a brand-new command: Start. To open a folder, just type START
followed by the folder path. For example, by typing START C
\WINDOWS, you'll open the Windows folder-not in DOS but in
Windows. You can also use the Start command to customize what
happens to apps and folders when you launch them. For a list
of options, just type START /? at the prompt.

If you're a true Command Line Commander, you'll want to make
the MS-DOS Prompt window as available as possible. Check out
my friends the Start Menu Maven and the Shortcut Showoff to
learn how to make the MS-DOS Prompt launch automatically at
startup and instantly when you press a shortcut key.

'Shortcut Showoff' Steve

The Keyboard Crazies and Command Line Kooks talk about speed,
and the Mickey Mouse Maniacs brag about computing intuitively.
But there's an easier and faster way to do all that. Win95's
new shortcut feature combines the speed of one with the intuitive
pointing and clicking of the other. And when you talk about
customization in Win95, you're talking about shortcuts. You
can use shortcuts to do other neat things as well-for instance,
you can e-mail a shortcut to a network document as an attachment
to a colleague, or you can send a shortcut to a Microsoft Network
site to a friend who also uses MSN.

You've heard of "information at your fingertips." Well, Win95
shortcuts can help you achieve that. Create shortcuts to all
the applications and documents on your system, as well as the
company network and the Internet. Then place them just a double
click away on your desktop.

Here's how to set up a desktop that puts everything at your
fingertips.

First, navigate My Computer to find any applications or documents
that you normally open more than once a week. Drag them onto
the desktop with the right mouse button and choose Create Shortcut(s)
Here. If you have folders with large numbers of documents that
you want to access, create shortcuts for those as well.

You may have already discovered Win95's cool Find utility. It
lets you search for any file, even if you don't know its name
or location. Using Find, you can set up a custom search that's
always on your desktop.

A good custom search acts as an instant dragnet for all documents
available to you on your desktop and the network. To set it
up, launch Find by pressing F3 or selecting it from the Start
menu. In the Named field, type in each of the extensions containing
documents you use, preceded by an asterisk and a period, and
separated by a space. Your list might look something like this
 *.doc *.txt *.xls *.wri *.hlp *.fin *.msg. In the Look In
field, list all the drive letters available to you over the
network, each followed by a colon and separated from one another
by semicolons. For example, you might want to type c:;s:;u
;j:;k: (your drive letters may differ). Click on the Find Now
button, then on the Stop button. Finally, select Save Search
from the File menu to put a copy of your search on the desktop.
You can rename it if you want.

To use your new saved search, double-click on its icon, select
the Advanced tab and type in words the document contains in
the Containing Text field. Note that you can modify the parameters
for each search any way you choose without permanently changing
the saved search. And you can set up as many unique saved searches
as you like.

Shortcuts are also great for launching batch files. Create batch
files that open several folders or documents at once, move
files around or otherwise get them to do whatever you need
them to do. Then create shortcuts for your batch files and
put them on the desktop (naturally, you should give 'em distinctive
icons and names)

Make sure you tell your batch file shortcuts to clean up after
themselves. Open the Properties dialog of each batch file shortcut,
select the Program tab and click on the Close on Exit box.
This tells Win95 to close the MS-DOS Prompt box when the batch
file has run its course.

Of course, batch files are just DOS programs. You can use shortcuts
to launch any DOS program or command from the desktop with
a simple double-click. In Win95, shortcuts replace the old
Win 3.x PIF.

Shortcuts can also help organize your forays online. If you
have the Microsoft Network or a Web browser that supports shortcuts,
you can simply drag your favorite sites from the online service
or Web window and drop them onto your desktop for quick access.

But wait! There's more! Shortcuts let you take advantage of
the slick Win95 Send To feature. Right-click on any item and
notice the cascading Send To item in the Context menu. All
those items in the Send To folder are just shortcuts in the
Send To folder, which you'll find in the Windows folder. Create
shortcuts-using the same method: Drag and drop with the right
mouse button and select Create Shortcut(s) Here-to your mail
application, the desktop, the Recycle Bin, the network, your
favorite application or anywhere else you'd like to be able
to send files instantly. Experiment and see what works best
for you.

Shortcuts are highly customizable. Most of this customization
takes place in the Properties dialog under the Shortcut tab.
First thing you'll want to do is give your shortcuts unique
icons. Just click on the Change Icon button and pick an icon
that suits your purpose. You might want to check out Win95's
"secret" icons, which you'll find in a file called PIFMGR.DLL
in the System folder. And, of course, the old Windows 3.x icons
in the files PROGMAN.EXE and MORICONS.DLL are likely still
living in your Windows folder.

Your next step is to change the names of your shortcuts. Get
rid of all those "Shortcut to" labels that Win95 put there.
Then decide if you want each shortcut to open the item full
screen, normal window or as an icon. To do so, select an option
from the Run box.

There are two advantages to putting shortcuts on your desktop
rather than scattering them all over your hard drive. The first
is ease of access; they're right there when you need them.
But what happens when they're all covered by open folders and
applications? Enter the second advantage: You can launch shortcuts
on the desktop with shortcut keys. Click once in the Shortcut
Key box of the Properties/Shortcut dialog and type a key combination
you'd like to use to launch the shortcut (don't spell it out,
just do the keystrokes). If the shortcut key is already taken,
Win95 won't let you use it. Once you've assigned keys to your
desktop shortcuts, you can launch them instantly, anytime,
regardless of what's on your screen. (Shortcut keys not on
the desktop or Start menu work only if the item is already
open.)

Simon the 'Start Menu Maven'

Been there. Done that. All that stuff is old. The taskbar, along
with its Start button and menus, is the only real interface
innovation in Win95. It's also the best. You just need to know
how to use it.

The default size of Start menu items is too large, and you can't
fit enough stuff in there. We'll fix that. Just right-click
on the taskbar and choose Properties. Then select the Show
Small Icons box and click on OK.

It's important to understand the Start menu and how it works.
Items on the Start menu are just shortcuts in a folder: the
Start Menu folder within the Windows folder. Removing and adding
Start menu items is as simple as removing and adding files
in a folder.

A great way to give yourself quick access to your most-used
apps, documents and folders is simply to drag them from wherever
they are and drop them onto the Start button. Doing this will
place them on the first level of the Start menu.

When you installed Win95, it made all your program groups cascading
menus under the Programs item. When you install new Windows
programs, they'll likely add things to your Start menu. Make
sure you remove all unwanted items to make room for those you
do want.

The Start menu itself is a cascading menu, meaning it opens
up into a hierarchy of menu items. Some pundits say that to
create a cascading Start menu item, you need to enter a bizarre
and complicated series of letters and numbers. But it ain't
so! It's the easiest thing in the world.

For example, here's how to create a cascading Control Panel
item. Right-click on the Start button and select Open. Now
open My Computer, double-click on the Control Panel item and
put the Start menu folder and Control Panel folders side-by
side. Right-click on the white part of the Start menu and select
New/Folder. Name it Control Panel. Now select all the Control
Panel items and drag and drop them onto the new Control Panel
folder. (You might want to open the new folder and get rid
of all the "Shortcut to" text that Win95 puts in front of all
your new shortcuts.) That's all there is to it. You can create
as many custom cascading Start menu items as you want.

Keystrokes can launch Start menu items as well. In fact, you
can navigate to any Start menu item using just the keyboard.
Ctrl+Esc brings up the Start menu. Pressing an underscored
letter (such as "D" for Documents) brings you to that item.
Navigate the cascading menus with the arrow keys (note that
if you're at the top of a menu, pressing the up arrow brings
you to the bottom, and vice versa). And here's a secret technique
my friend Carl taught me: You know those most-used items you
placed on the first level of the Start menu? Right-click on
the Start button, select Open, select each item in turn and
give it a unique number from 1 to 10 (for example, change "WordPerfect"
to "1 WordPerfect"). By pressing Ctrl+Esc and then a number,
you can quickly open the item associated with that number.

'Folder Fanatic' Frank

Sure, keystrokes are fast, mice are intuitive, shortcuts are
cool and the Start menu is innovative. But the important thing
is how you organize and think about your work. The Win95 interface
lets us think about our work by projects-it's all based on
nested folders. Combine that with shortcuts, and we're no longer
limited by the old DOS directory structure.

Here's what I mean. I mentally divide my work into three major
categories: projects I'm working on; management responsibilities;
and regular tasks like meetings, business trips and budget
management that aren't really projects and aren't really about
people management. Win95 folders let me organize my computer
to mirror the organized way I think about my work. As you've
probably already guessed, I have three folders. One is called
"Projects," the second is called "People" and the last is called
"Other Stuff I Gotta Do" (what the heck, it's my desktop)

In my Projects folder, I've got a folder for each project I'm
working on. Each has e-mail messages about the project (just
drag and drop from Exchange), links to budget information,
links to documents listing my goals, lists of people involved
and a shortcut to my contact manager.

In my People folder, I've got one folder for each person who
reports to me. In each of those folders, I've placed key e
mail I want to keep, confidential information on each person,
links to the projects we're collaborating on and more links
to my contact manager. Some of the people on my staff have
staffs of their own. In their folders, I have one folder for
each person who reports to that manager.

My third folder contains everything else.

That's how I've arranged my system. But you might want to set
yours up differently. For example, you could create a folder
called Backup, where you place all your documents and other
things you'd like to back up. In fact, you can put entire folders
there. When you want to back up your system (highly recommended,
by the way), you just have to back up that folder and everything
in it.

I like to give my folders unique icons. The way to do this is
to create a folder called, er, Folders anywhere on the C: drive.
Put all the folders for which you want unique icons inside
this folder. Create shortcuts to the folders and place the
shortcuts wherever you want them. Then, using the instructions
above, give each shortcut a unique icon.

I'm also using a fake Recycle Bin. That's where I put items
I think I want to throw away. The fake Bin sits on my desktop
in the lower right-hand corner next to my real Recycle Bin.
When I'm sure I want to dump something, I put it into the genuine
Recycle Bin; when I'm not sure, I put it into the fake one.
Once every couple of months, I open the fake Bin and trash
or save the items in it.

'Explorer' Ed

Computing is an adventure. And the best way to conquer your
computer is with the Win95 Explorer. It's File Manager, Program
Manager, Win95 folders, shortcuts and all the rest rolled into
one awesome, intuitive and powerful interface.

What's so great about Explorer? Well, it gives you a familiar
DOS-style hierarchical view of every resource available to
you (everything on your desktop, peripheral drives such as
your CD-ROM drive, network resources, printers and more). It's
all in one expandable list on the left side of your screen.
At the same time, Explorer shows the contents of the currently
selected item on the right. If you want to look at the contents
of two folders at once, just launch another instance of Explorer
(launch as many as you like!). The interface looks simple,
but you can use it as a command-and-control center to do all
your file management and other tasks.

You can quickly slice and dice the on-screen folder view by
clicking on one of the View buttons on the toolbar. If you
select the Details button, you'll get heading bars above your
list of files. By clicking on each, you'll toggle between the
"most" and the "least" properties for each bar (for example,
if you click on the Modified bar, you'll toggle between the
most recent files on the top or the oldest on the top). If
you're viewing a folder full of files and select Tools/Find
Files or Folders, the Find utility will open and default to
the current folder. That'll help you find what you need without
searching your entire hard drive.

Enough about how great Explorer is-let's get this incredible
utility onto the desktop. Right-click on the Start button,
select Explore and double-click on the Programs folder in the
right pane. Drag the Windows Explorer icon from the window
using the right mouse button and drop it onto the desktop,
then select Copy Here.

If you're not in an Explorer view for a particular folder, you
can get there by clicking once on the folder you want to open,
then pressing and holding the Shift key while you double-click
on the folder (you have to click once to select it; otherwise
you'll select and open that folder plus all the others between
it and the top of the list)

You can customize folders using a Win95 convention called "Explorer
switches." Give the folders on your desktop an Explorer view
by bringing up the Properties menu, selecting Shortcut and
typing Explorer /e, in front of the path in the Target line
(make sure you include the comma and a space after the comma)

You can also use an Explorer switch to select a file without
launching it. Right-click on a shortcut and select Properties
from the Context menu. Click on the Shortcut tab. Type Explorer
/Select, in front of the path in the Target line (make sure
you include the comma and a space after the comma) and add
the full filename to the end of the path. Then click on OK.
Now, whenever you double-click on that shortcut, the file will
be selected but not opened.

If you want to keep things simple, create shortcuts that open
into "rooted Explorer" views. Right-click on the desktop and
select New/Shortcut. In the command line of the New Shortcuts
dialog, type Explorer /e, /root, c:

This will make the folder the root-in other words, it will
sit at the top of the hierarchy and you won't see anything
in that view except the folder and its contents.

Carl told me how to rip through Explorer with keystrokes: The
spacebar moves down the drives in Explorer. The Backspace key
moves up the Explorer tree. The left arrow key shrinks the
Explorer tree. The right arrow key expands the Explorer tree.
The up and down arrow keys move up and down one folder at a
time. The Home and End keys move you to the top and bottom,
respectively. Pressing a letter moves you to the nearest folder
that starts with that letter. Press F6 to switch between panes.
And you can select all the files in the right pane by making
sure at least one of the files in the pane is selected or that
the directory in the left pane is selected, then pressing Ctrl+A.

Michael the 'Minimalist'

I'll keep this short.

I need to stay organized. All the methods above are fine, as
long as these techniques are used to impose order and not clutter.
You can create a desktop that's free of debris, and still have
all the power of keystrokes, mouse navigation, the command
line, shortcuts, the Start menu, folders and Explorer--all
lurking just beneath the surface, out of sight and out of mind.

I'll show you how to combine many of the techniques and approaches
used by my seven counterparts, and still sport a clutter-free
screen. But first, let's clean up that desktop!

Right-click on the taskbar, then select Properties/Auto Hide
from the Context menu. This will keep the taskbar invisible
until your mouse pointer gets near the bottom of the screen.

Okay, let's create a workspace. Open My Computer, then the C
 drive. Create a folder called Workspace (or whatever you'd
like to call it). Now drag and drop it with the right mouse
button onto the desktop and select Create Shortcut(s) Here.
Give the new shortcut the name and icon of your choice (using
instructions above)

Now use Ed's Explorer switch to make this new shortcut open
into an Explorer view. In the Workspace folder, use Frank's
folder-centric approach to create folders that open to broad
categories such as Info, People, Projects-whatever makes sense
for the way you like to work. And, of course, you'll want to
populate these folders with the appropriate shortcuts and files.

Get rid of all the icons on your desktop that you don't need.
Bury them. The end result should be a desktop that contains
My Computer, Network Neighborhood, the Recycle Bin, your Workspace
shortcut icon and perhaps an Inbox.

It's an uncluttered desktop, but all the power is there. Check
out Carl's keystrokes. Learn Mary's mouse tricks. Bring up
the command line with one of Steve's shortcuts and fire off
some of Colin's MS-DOS Prompt commands. Finally, master Simon's
Start menu tips-but whatever you do, keep it simple! You'll
be as productive as you can be with Win95.

Cover Story: Lock Your Windows -- Here's how to plug seven common Windows
security holes.

By:
Fred Langa

If you're like me, the most important parts of your computing
life hinge on Windows. At work, there's Windows-based e-mail,
general communications and information sharing via Windows,
and Windows word processing, database activity and spreadsheets.

At home, Windows probably handles your tax information, family
budget and home-office data. In fact, all my critical computer
based information depends on Windows-and I'll bet yours does,
too. Unfortunately, with the exception of NT (which does have
good safeguards), Windows' overall security has not kept up
with the increasing value of the data we entrust to it. All
the other versions of Windows, including Win95, have one or
more gaping security flaws that can put your data at risk from
both intentional snooping and accidental access. Nothing can
completely secure anyone's data against a determined attack
by skilled computer criminals. But there are steps you can
take to provide reasonable basic protection against some of
the most notorious security flaws in Windows and in key Windows
apps:

1. The Boot Bypass. Even if you know only a little about computers,
you can make a boot floppy disk and use it to get your system
running. If your computer security depends on safeguards that
load and run after the initial boot (such as a password-protected
screen saver), you're vulnerable. Solution: Prevent unauthorized
physical access to your machine (lock the room it's in); use
the keyboard lock and remove the key; use the BIOS settings
on newer machines to prevent booting from a floppy or to enable
a power-on password.

2. The Password Is 'Cancel.' Most people don't realize this,
but by default Win95's log-on password offers absolutely no
security. (If you have a log-on password, try pressing Cancel
or Escape the next time you start Windows-the password dialog
will close, and you'll be placed on the default desktop just
as if you'd typed the correct, secret password you set up.)
Solution: In Control Panel's Passwords applet, click on the
User Profiles tab, and then click on the "Users can customize
their preferences" item. This will allow you to give your log
on settings and access privileges that are different from those
of the default Win95 log-on. Next, use Win95's Policy Editor
to define what each user of your system can and cannot do.
Each log-on can have its own set of privileges, access to different
files and so on. You can severely limit what a default log
on can do. You'll find the Policy Editor and the complete Win95
Resource Kit (which can answer almost any security-related
question) on the CD version of Win95 in the ADMIN/APPTOOL/POLEDIT
directory, or you can download the files from Microsoft's World
Wide Web site at http://www.windows.microsoft.com/windows/software.htm.
You can also find more complete instructions for enabling the
log-on password in my December editorial (Start, December 1995)

3. Private E-Mails Are Really Open Letters. In Windows 95, by
default, anyone can walk up to your system, use his or her
own log-on and potentially gain full access to all your supposedly
private e-mail stored in Exchange, the "universal inbox" that
comes with Win95. (It looks like the programming team that
wrote Exchange expected Win95 to provide basic security, while
the Win95 team expected Exchange to provide security for itself.)
Even if you entered a password to convert your old e-mail to
Exchange, you're still vulnerable. Solution: Enable Win95's
base security as described in item 2. Then go to Exchange's
Tools/Services menu, select the Personal Folder file (or whatever
it's named on your system) and click on Properties. Then click
on Change Password and enter a password different from your
system password. Now both your e-mail and your basic desktop
are safe from at least casual snooping.

4. Take My Files, Please. When you installed Windows 95, you
may have enabled the "I want to be able to give others access
to my files" option, as well as the TCP/IP networking protocol
to access the Internet. If you did, you may inadvertently be
sharing your files with people all over the world. (To Microsoft's
credit, its own Internet Explorer Web browser looks for this
condition when you install it, and offers to turn off Print
and File Sharing for the TCP/IP protocol.) Solution: Examine
the TCP/IP properties via Control Panel's Network applet, and
make sure Print and File Sharing is unchecked in the Bindings
tab dialog. In Explorer, right-click on each drive and use
the Sharing menu to set up passwords for each.

5.  While You're At It, Take a Few More Files.  There's a flaw in Win95's
Print and File Sharing software that, in relatively limited circumstances,
also can result in a wider sharing of files than you intended.  (The lengthy
full details are available on the Web at
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/w95fpup.htm.)  Solution:  Download
the free, updated version of Print and File Sharing services from Microsoft's
Web site at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/download/vservupd.exe.

6. Word's Extra Baggage. Starting with Word 6.0 for Windows,
Microsoft set Word's default Save behavior to "Allow Fast Saves."
This saves some time because only the changes from one version
of a document get written to disk. But it also means some or
all of your original drafts ride along with the final version.
Anyone viewing the final .DOC file with a plain-vanilla file
viewer-Notepad, for instance-can see this original draft material
in all its glory. At the least, it's embarrassing. At worst,
if your early drafts contained intemperate, sensitive or confidential
information you didn't want in the final draft, it could be
disastrous. Relatedly, by default, Word chooses the first few
words of your first draft as the description on each document's
Properties Sheet. Solution: In the Tools/Options menu, turn
off Allow Fast Saves and turn on Prompt for Document Properties.

7. "OLE" or "Oh, No"? A flaw in Microsoft's OLE (Object Linking
and Embedding) technology can result in similar behavior to
item 6, but for a completely different reason: Parts of files
you thought were deleted can reappear in later document files,
where they can be viewed via programs like Notepad. Solution
 Watch for bug-fix updates, which should be available when
you read this.

Cover Story: The Win95 Top 10 List -- Explorer, folders, drag and drop: Here's
a list of our 10 favorite Windows 95 features, and tips on
how to take advantage of them.

By:
Mike Elgan

10. Right-mouse-button support. Finally, we get to use that
right mouse button. Right-click on any item to bring up a Context
menu, where you'll find the all-important Properties item.
Empty the Recycle Bin in a flash by right-clicking and selecting
Empty Recycle Bin. And to open a document in an app other than
the one it's associated with, press Shift+Right-click to add
the Open With command to your Context menu.

9. Folders. Win95 transformed Windows from the least flexible
OS to the most. Folders are a great example. You can set up
deeply nested folders and make Windows look like a Mac, or
you can imitate Program Manager by creating a few folders on
your desktop and putting shortcuts in them. Other operating
systems have had nested folders for years. Now Win95 has 'em!

8. The MS-DOS Prompt. Some say DOS is dead, but what they mean
is that many of the annoying qualities of DOS are extinct.
The Win95 implementation of DOS is actually pretty cool. Win95
runs DOS apps natively, rather than in emulation, which maximizes
performance. Win95's DOS sports new features (such as the ability
to launch Windows apps) without losing any of the old ones.
And unlike the DOS of yore, PIFs have been killed. Good riddance
to them!

7. The Find utility. Here's a quiet little gem. If you know
how to use it, the Find utility can retrieve files across your
network and the Microsoft Network, even if you don't know the
filename or location. Bring up Find by pressing F3 or by selecting
Find/File or Folders from the Start menu. The Win95 Find utility
supports wild-card capabilities beyond the standard asterisk.
For example, a question mark before a character or string finds
the character or string anywhere in the filename (except at
the beginning). Find will also search for folders and files
that contain characters in the order you typed them. Find's
most powerful features are in the Advanced tab. Here you can
type in a text string that you know is in the file, select
the type of file you're looking for and narrow your search
by file size.

6. Drag-and-drop support. Drag and drop in Windows 3.x was pretty
good, but it's even better in Win95. If you have an application
or folder minimized or hidden behind other windows, for example,
you can drag a file over the button on the taskbar, hold it
there for a second, and the app opens on top, allowing you
to drop the file there. Create shortcuts on your desktop to
your floppy drive, printers and folders on the network so you
can easily drag and drop files to any of these. In addition,
you can drag and drop pieces of documents, known as scraps,
as well as entire files.

5. The taskbar. The taskbar is deceptively simple. This thin
gray rectangle lets you open and configure the Start menu,
view everything that's running, see and change the time and
date, switch between applications and folders, adjust the volume
of your sound, and minimize, restore, tile or cascade open
apps and folders. You can drag and drop the taskbar anywhere
on your screen, keep it visible at all times or hide it automatically.

4. Disk compression. Out-of-the-box disk compression in Win95
is stable, safe and useful. But take our advice and buy Microsoft
Plus for Windows 95-if for nothing else than the Compression
Agent and DriveSpace 3. You'll be able to UltraPack files you
rarely use, HiPack those you use occasionally and leave files
you don't want to squeeze alone.

3. The System Agent. Here's another must-have Microsoft Plus
item. The System Agent lurks silently in memory, waiting to
do your bidding. Tell it to perform hard-disk maintenance,
alert you with pop-up reminders, run batch files at scheduled
times, or do backups in the background. The kicker is that
this utility is super-easy to use; you can set up a custom
scheduled event in less than a minute.

2. The Send To menu. With a click of your mouse, the Send To
command lets you blast any file to any location on your system
or on the network-or to any application. Right-click on any
file, select Send To and the location, and the file is as good
as there.

1. Explorer. And the number-one Win95 feature ... Explorer!
Actually, Explorer is a mixed bag (it's also on the Bottom
10 list). But its good features are really good. It shows your
computing universe in the left pane, and the currently selected
folder in the right. Slice and dice the view to sort by size
or date last modified, and use the toolbar to map network drives.

Cover Story: The Win95 Bottom 10 List -- Nothing is perfect, and that includes
Windows 95. So, we compiled a Bottom 10 List as a counterpoint
to our Top 10 List. But instead of just griping, we came up
with a few solutions that you can work into Win95 on your own.

By:
Jim Boyce

10. Technical support. Windows 95 technical support is geared
primarily toward hand-holding to help users overcome setup
problems and difficulties with various features. If you're
a power user with a tough technical question, you'll sometimes
have trouble just explaining the problem to the technician
on the other end of the line. Solution: There are alternatives
to telephone support. Explore the wide variety of online forums
devoted to the subject, starting with Microsoft's Win95 World
Wide Web site at http://www.microsoft.com. In addition, all
the major online services have Windows areas where other users
have most likely posted similar questions that were answered
by people in the know. You should also get and use the Win95
Resource Kit. It's available free on the CD version of Win95
in the ADMIN/APPTOOL/POLEDIT directory, or you can download
the files from Microsoft's Web site at http://www.windows.microsoft.com
windows/software.htm. If you're completely on your own for
tech support, or if others rely on you for guidance, consider
a subscription to Microsoft's CD-based TechNet service (800
344-2121), which contains most of the same information available
to Microsoft's own support technicians.

9. The Recycle Bin. Recycle Bin is a safety net you could drive
a truck through. If you delete a file from an application or
the command line, it's gone. The Recycle Bin also needs better
overflow support. You can specify the amount of disk space
to allocate for the Recycle Bin on each drive, but when that
limit is reached, those deleted files go to binary heaven with
no warning. And if you push the Recycle Bin capacity slider
to zero by accident, everything in the Bin is history. Solution
 You can partially overcome these shortcomings with a third
party product like Norton Utilities, which adds extra goodies
such as chronological emptying of the wastebasket. But even
with these add-ons, your best line of defense is abundant backups
and careful work.

8. Shortcuts. Shortcuts are actually one of the best features
in Win95, but many users see room for improvement in their
appearance. Solution: Do you find the arrows in shortcut icons
annoying? Check out the Tweak UI tools in the sidebar "In a
Word, Wow!" on the next page.

7. Microsoft Backup. We're glad Microsoft included a backup
utility with Win95. Unfortunately, it doesn't support a very
wide range of tape drives. It also doesn't reset the archive
bit by default, so incremental backup doesn't work unless you
wade through menus and read the instructions very, very carefully.
Solution: Check out the Colorado Memory Systems BBS (970-635
0650) for updates to Win95's Backup. (CMS wrote the original
applet for Microsoft, and should be releasing an updated version
soon.) Also, all the major tape backup vendors have promised
Win95 versions "any minute."

6. My Computer and Network

Neighborhood. The problem with My Computer is its lack of all
but the most basic customization capability. For example, My
Computer always opens folders using the Open view rather than
an Explorer view. Network Neighborhood also needs better features
for customization. Solution: If you don't like My Computer
or Network Neighborhood, ignore them and create a custom viewer
that gives you the capabilities of both. Create a folder on
your hard disk, then drag it to the desktop with your right
mouse button. Select Create Shortcut(s) Here. Right-click on
the new shortcut and bring up the Properties dialog. Change
the icon by clicking on the Change Icon button, selecting an
icon and clicking on OK. Now type Explorer /e, in front of
the path in the Target line (make sure you include the comma
and a space after the comma). Click on OK. Whenever you double
click on that shortcut, you'll get the full Explorer view.

5. Help. The new Help looks good, but we need much more content,
especially since Microsoft did away with all but the most basic
paper documentation. Solution: Try the Resource Kit and the
TechNet CD mentioned in item 10.

4. The Microsoft Network. MSN is the not-ready-for-prime-time
network. Although the content is improving, the service is
still weak overall. MSN lacks an off-line forum reader and
is generally slow. Solution: Just say no to MSN for a while.
Keep your eye on WINDOWS Magazine, and we'll tell you when
it gets better.

3. Explorer. Some of the better features of File Manager are
missing from Explorer, which cannot display file attributes
and the "last accessed" property. Support for multiple Content
panes would also be a plus. Solution: If you don't like Explorer,
keep your eye out for a replacement package that supports the
features you need. Don't be afraid to pop open File Manager
when you need to (Run: Winfile)

2. Plug and Play. Plug and Play works well even on legacy systems,
assuming your hardware is relatively common. But the hardware
detection seems to take forever, and Windows 95 sometimes forgets
to tell you that the device you're installing is already installed.
Solution: Don't buy any hardware that isn't PnP-compatible.
If PnP isn't working well on your system, consider a BIOS upgrade.
And make sure your next system is fully PnP-compatible.

1. Exchange and Microsoft Fax. The idea of an integrated message
store is great in theory, but so far Exchange falls flat. You
can't create a single address entry for multiple address types
(Microsoft Mail and Fax, for example), there's a noticeable
lack of security, and the address book integrates poorly with
applications. Microsoft Fax takes most of the heat for its
lack of features, its bugs and an inability to live in the
same profile with Microsoft's own Internet Mail provider. Another
glaring shortcoming is the Microsoft Mail provider's inability
to work with Microsoft Mail Remote, forcing system administrators
to add a remote access server to support remote Exchange users.
Solution: If you want, you can stick with your current e-mail
and messaging system until Exchange is ready for prime time,
or embrace a third-party solution that meets your needs. But
Exchange won't go away anytime soon, so it's worth exploring.
Keep your eyes open for pitfalls. If you're ready to give it
a try, see this month's article "Kill Your Fax Machine!"

Cover Story: In a Word, "Wow!"

By:
Fred Langa

Want to get rid of shortcut arrows? Or permanently ditch the
"Shortcut to ..." phrase that keeps getting added to the names
of shortcuts you create? Want to adjust menu pop-up speed?
Change resolutions on the fly? Painlessly browse and extract
files from within .CAB files? Or make any CD play automatically?

All that and much more is available in the free PowerToys utility
collection from Microsoft. The PowerToys were written by the
Windows 95 UI team to solve many of the annoying little glitches
and inadequacies of Win95's interface, but the utilities were
developed too late to be part of the official software release.
As a result, these are unsupported applets: They seem to work
just fine, but you can't call tech support for help if you
run into a snag. We use them here at WINDOWS Magazine and feel
they're a must-have addition for any power user.

Browse to http://www.windows.microsoft.com/windows/software
powertoy.htm on the World Wide Web and download one or more
of the following little gems:

Tweak UI: The crown jewel of PowerToys, this is an addition
to the Control Panel that lets you change menu speed, mouse
sensitivity, window animation and sound, shortcut appearance
and default names, and much more. A definite thumbs-up.

CabView: Lets you examine .CAB files as if they were ordinary
folders-you can see the contents and easily drag files in and
out.

CD AutoPlay Extender: Makes autoplay work even on non-audio
CDs so you can gain faster access to your CD-based programs.

Contents Menu: Lets you examine the contents of folders without
even opening them.

Explore From Here: Open a "rooted" Explorer from anywhere, even
on remote network resources.

FlexiCD : An instant-access, taskbar-window audio CD control.

QuickRes: If your video card and drivers allow it, this tool
lets you change your screen's dots-per-inch setting and bit
depth from the taskbar without having to reboot.

Round Clock: This is simply a round analog clock sans the usual
square window.

Shortcut Target Menu: Examine the properties of a shortcut's
target by right-clicking on the shortcut itself.

XMouse: X Windows users will like this utility, which makes
the active window focus follow the mouse cursor without clicking.

Kill Your Fax Machine -- Dump the office fax machine for the
superior combination of your fax modem and Microsoft Exchange.

By:
Rich Levin

I'm sitting at my desk, sipping some day-old java and checking
out the racing form, when the door swings open. A guy in an
out-of-date getup shuffles in. Boy, is he past his prime, I
think as I reach for a Camel. He just looks at me while I light
up and take a deep drag. Neither of us says a word. Finally,
my new client clears his throat. "Mister Narlowe, they're out
to get me."

Somehow I'm not surprised. He has the look of someone on the
skids. "Well, why don't you tell me about it, Mister "

"Call me Fax," he says, in a rusty voice. "Fax Machine."

An alarm bell goes off in my head. I'd read about him in the
tabloids. Sad case. Nothing I could do for him.

"Sorry, I can't help you," I reply, with some regret. It kills
me to turn down any business. "You're history, pal. Windows
95 is gonna punch your ticket. Exchange is the new game in
town, and it's making hay with fax modems."

Fax slumps against the wall, muttering something that sounds
like, "I knew I was a goner."

I don't say a word. What is there to say? He's right. Him and
his breed are old news. Gonzo. Kaput. Windows 95 has seen to
that.

The Fax on the Case

Fax modems and software have been around for several years.
But Windows 95's integral support of the new TAPI (Telephony
Application Programming Interface) standard for communications
hardware greatly simplifies the way you exchange information,
including the way you send a fax.

Before TAPI, every fax modem was an island. There was no off
the-shelf fax software that allowed users to share fax modems,
address books or data files. It was every faxer for himself,
and every file for itself. Fax documents, like e-mail messages,
were a unique data type, married to the programs that managed
them. E-mail was e-mail, documents were documents, faxes were
faxes, and never the three would meet. Worst of all, for corporations
seeking to achieve proper desktop fax capabilities, each computer
required a fax modem, fax software and an extra telephone line.

Lack of workgroup functionality, harsh economic realities and
unfriendly side effects limited the growth of desktop faxing.
It was cheaper and easier to stick with conventional fax machines,
or to deploy dedicated network fax servers to provide workgroup
fax services to the enterprise.

Insufficient standards, along with a single-user focus, also
prevented mass-market fax software from integrating tightly
within the enterprise. Users had to deal with separate address
books for mail messages, fax documents and external e-mail
services like CompuServe. With no published standards to follow,
software developers had a free hand in designing fax programs.
The result: One fax program couldn't use another's address
books, cover sheets or fax files. While a few de facto standards
(such as Intel's DCX file format) emerged, the situation was
similar to the chaos that accompanied electronic mail before
the advent of the Mail Application Programming Interface (MAPI)

Today, we take it for granted that virtually any two PC e-mail
systems can exchange mail, but it wasn't long ago that many
Windows-based e-mail systems were segregated. This changed
with the introduction of MAPI, which dictates how e-mail programs
talk to each other. And what MAPI does for e-mail, TAPI does
for faxing.

Tap into TAPI

MAPI has been around since 1993, but TAPI is a new-and evolving
standard. Only one fax program designed for Windows 95 currently
supports TAPI. The good news: The program is Microsoft Fax,
and it's bundled with Windows 95.

TAPI lives at the operating system level, so any program can
use it. That's why, under Win95, you need only configure your
modem, telephone numbers and other setup data once. TAPI-compliant
programs retrieve setup information through TAPI, which takes
care of all the configuration details formerly handled by individual
programs. This means you can drop in a new TAPI-compliant telecom
app and it will automatically recognize your COM ports, modem
commands and telephone numbers.

TAPI also manages access to your COM ports and attached devices.
As a result, you can have multiple comm apps running at the
same time without worrying about port conflicts. TAPI-compliant
apps know when a COM port is in use and simply wait their turn,
which means no more system lockups or error messages like "COM
port X is in use." When a call is received, TAPI directs the
connection to the appropriate communications software.

Microsoft Fax and TAPI allow Windows 95 to see faxes as another
form of e-mail. That's why Microsoft Fax is tightly coupled
to (and dependent on) Microsoft Exchange, Win95's universal
e-mail client.

The Times, They Are Ex-Changin'

Microsoft Exchange is not exactly new. Remember Microsoft Mail?
How about Microsoft At Work Fax? Exchange is the offspring
of these two applets. Double-click on your Desktop's Inbox
icon, and behold MS Mail and At Work Fax, dressed in new 32
bit duds complete with a TAPI makeover and a new name for Win95.
(For installation instructions, see the sidebar "The Right
Way to Set Up Microsoft Fax.")

The philosophy behind Exchange is simple: Everything that enters
or leaves your computer is part of the "media stream." MAPI
and TAPI direct media traffic in and out of your computer.
The software simply dumps information into and out of the media
stream, using unchanging API calls. The APIs handle all the
dirty work that was previously delegated to discrete programs.
This explains why every major Microsoft app features a Send
command on the File menu after you've installed Exchange. That
one button allows you to reach many destinations.

It shouldn't matter whether the person to whom you're sending
a document is using e-mail, an online service or a fax. With
Microsoft Exchange, you simply look up the person's name and
send the document. The recipient's address tells Exchange the
nature of the transmission: e-mail, binary data or fax.

Suppose you're sending a document to five people: one on interoffice
e-mail, one on CompuServe, one on the Microsoft Network, one
on the Internet and one using a fax. Exchange packages the
document and dispatches it to all five destinations. The interoffice
address is routed to the network post office, while the CompuServe,
MS Network and Internet mail are sent to their service providers.

With faxes, however, things get really interesting. When Exchange
dials the fax user, it queries the recipient to see if it's
running Windows 95 and Microsoft Exchange. If it is, Exchange
sends the mail as a binary file, which can be opened and edited
without using OCR (optical character recognition) to first
convert the file to text.

If the fax recipient isn't running Windows 95, Exchange sends
the mail as a standard 200-dot-per-inch fax. So, with a single
mouse click you can send one document to several addresses,
each using a different form of electronic document transport.

In other words, faxing under Win95 is essentially a point-to
point form of e-mail-with attachments!-unless there's a fax
machine at the other end. The sender doesn't have to worry
about the recipient's setup. For the first time, the receiver
of electronic messages using the fax protocol doesn't need
a third-party e-mail account or a fax machine. Your faxes effectively
become a form of binary data transfer. You can send a single
e-mail message (again, with attachments) to a whole bunch of
people at once; some of them can have various types of e-mail
addresses, and some fax machines, but all can receive your
missive. Without Microsoft Exchange and MS Fax, you'd have
to send the document five times, using five different programs.
You'd also have to check five times for replies.

Even more importantly, you can use Windows 95's built-in networking
to share a single fax modem with every computer in the enterprise.
Open up Control Panel's Mail and Fax applet, then activate
Sharing; your fax modem becomes a network resource. Other users
can then connect to it through the Network Neighborhood and
use it to send and receive faxes. You don't need any additional
hardware or software.

Think of the possibilities. You can use a single line for enterprisewide
or workgroup faxing. You can forward received faxes to the
appropriate parties, including outside e-mail and fax addresses,
and attach notes and comments. Also, the single interface allows
for simple procedures to be made even simpler without automation.
You can create libraries of commonly faxed materials-such as
spec sheets, literature and credit references-to fax-on-demand
in a few short steps. Received faxes can be stored in organized
folder hierarchies, either locally or on the server, for fast
shared access by all employees.

The fax is no longer merely a way to deliver documents quickly.
Rather, it's become an exciting form of point-to-point electronic
mail, inheriting the same handling, routing and communications
strengths that e-mail has provided for years.

The only kink in Exchange's otherwise graceful interface is
installation. Getting Exchange running takes too many steps
and can involve up to four different programs. If you install
from the wrong entry point (for example, launching Inbox instead
of Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs applet), the setup process
may end with a resounding thud.

Microsoft would do well to integrate Exchange Setup under a
single Setup Wizard. Users should have to do nothing more than
double-click on the Desktop's Inbox icon. Exchange should control
the rest.

That's not the case, unfortunately. Depending upon how you installed
Windows 95, Exchange may not be there. Even though every copy
of Win95 features an Inbox icon on the Desktop, key Exchange
components may be missing.

It's a good idea to check the status of your Exchange installation
before trying to fax. Once you've confirmed that your Exchange
station is ready for use, it's not much farther to fax city.
Simply select Microsoft Fax as your printer in any program's
Print dialog, and the Microsoft Fax Wizard will hold your hand
until the fax is sent.

Don't worry if the recipient's e-mail address isn't a fax number.
Exchange automatically sends your documents using the correct
transport protocol, provided you have the appropriate services
installed in your Exchange Profile (a list of Exchange's transport
services)

For example, fax, the Internet and CompuServe are all transport
services. Each of these can be assigned to your Exchange profile,
found through the Inbox under Tools/Services. You can also
add intracompany mail or any other supported service. That
way, when you send a document, every listed service is available.

If you're using Exchange for fax only, you don't have to deal
with Profile; just set up Microsoft Fax and be on your merry
way. But if you plan to send documents to both fax and e-mail
recipients, you'll have to make sure the appropriate services
appear in Microsoft Exchange.

Microsoft has evolved PC faxing from a monolithic, cantankerous
tool to an elegant e-mail derivative. The ease with which users
can integrate Microsoft Fax into their overall communications
strategy is impressive. As software becomes easier to use,
however, its underlying technologies become proportionately
denser and more complex.

Within Microsoft's own applications, ease of use is represented
by a humble Send command on your applications' File menu. Click
on it, and the most advanced communications processes ever
to grace a PC operating system steam into action. MAPI, TAPI
and other exceptional operating system features are the complex
structures that make this ease of use possible. Set aside some
time and explore the new frontiers available with Exchange.
You'll never return to your old faxing ways.

You can go ahead and kill your fax machine now-with Exchange's
advanced capabilities, there's not a court in the land that
would find you guilty.

The Right Way to Set Up Microsoft's Fax

By:
Rich Levin

 
Step 1

See if Microsoft Exchange and MS Fax are installed Double-click
on My Computer, then Control Panel, then Add/Remove Programs.
Click on Windows Setup. Scroll down the list and see if Exchange
and Fax are checked. If they are, you're ready to go-skip to
Step 3. If not, proceed to Step 2.

Step 2

Install Microsoft Exchange and MS Fax Check the boxes beside
Exchange and Fax. Click on OK. Setup will copy the required
files and start the Inbox Setup Wizard. After you complete
a few forms, the Wizard will ask you to select the information
services you want to use with Microsoft Exchange. When Setup
is done, it will have automatically identified and initialized
your modem, installed Exchange's default phone book and Inbox
databases, configured Microsoft Fax and installed shortcuts.

The information you entered will be available to all MAPI- and
TAPI-compliant programs, so you'll never have to key it in
again. Click the Start button, select Shut Down and restart
your computer.

Step 3

Send a test fax Click on the Start button, then on Programs.
Select Accessories and activate WordPad. After WordPad loads,
type some text and click on File, then Print. Click on the
Name drop-down list and select Microsoft Fax. Click on OK.
The Microsoft Fax Wizard will activate and help you prepare
the outbound fax.

Step 4

Finishing touches and notes To fax a document from any Windows
program, simply select Microsoft Fax from the program's Print
dialog, and the Microsoft Fax Wizard will appear. If you want
Microsoft Fax to answer your phone and handle faxes automatically,
double-click on the Inbox icon on your Desktop and minimize
the window. When you use File+Send, or the Microsoft Fax printer
driver, to send a document, you'll have an opportunity to choose
addresses from your address book. Feel free to mix and match
addresses for fax, e-mail and binary-data recipients; they're
all the same to Exchange.

To view received faxes, double-click on the Inbox icon. New
faxes will appear in the Inbox. If you want to share your fax
modem with other users, run Control Panel's Mail and Fax program,
go into Microsoft Fax Properties and click on the check box
 Let other people on the network use my modem to send faxes.

If you make a mistake while adding a service or completing its
setup screen, click on Cancel to undo your errors. To update
service settings, run Control Panel's Mail and Fax program
again, select a service and click on Properties.

The Fax on the Competition

By:
Rich Levin

Microsoft Fax may be the only 32-bit, TAPI-compliant faxware
for Windows 95, but it won't remain so for long. Every major
fax software developer is providing 32-bit upgrades. See the
"Fax Features" chart for an overview of the next generation
of Windows faxware.

We anticipate the major desktop players will pack their Windows
95 offerings with features you won't find in Microsoft Fax,
such as 

Database import and export -- Every major fax program provides
a way to import names and numbers from other programs. Most
support data translation to and from dBASE and ASCII-delimited
formats. Import/export makes it easy to share address books
with other users. Export your current address book to a dBASE
file, import the information within your fax program and you're
ready to go.

Microsoft committed a major oversight when it neglected to add
import/export functions to MS Fax. Unless you manually enter
every name and number, it's impossible to import contact information.

Integrated telecommunications apps -- Dedicated fax software
is quickly becoming a thing of the past. The trend is toward
TAPI-compliant suite packages that bundle basic communications
capability, terminal emulation, remote access, Internet connection,
fax handling and even pager support into a single mega-app.
The component applications can share data and provide a single
communications interface.

Integrated telephony -- Some communications suites now deliver
voice mail, autodial, speakerphone and, in some cases, personal
pager support. Computer voice mail, in particular, was once
the domain of telecom experts peddling high-end dedicated workstations
and expensive add-on hardware. Now these features can be yours
for little more than the cost of a modem. PC voice mail performs
well and interacts with your other telephony apps, including
fax.

"Three-dimensional" fax -- New data-representation technologies
let you send a fax that contains program and data files. 3D
Fax, a fax-software enhancement from InfoImaging Technologies
(800-966-1140), converts file data to a high-density bar-code
like image. It uses your existing fax software and hardware
to send the image to any standard fax machine or PC fax modem.
When the resulting document is decoded by the receiving computer
using the 3D Fax software, the document's binary contents emerge.
You can send virtually any type of on-disk data to any type
of fax machine.

While Microsoft Fax can send documents as editable text and
binary data as embedded OLE objects, it's limited to communicating
with other MS Fax users. Through bar-code scanning, 3D Fax
can transmit binary files using PC fax modems or old-fashioned
fax machines.

You can download 3D Fax from America Online or the World Wide
Web (or InfoImaging will send you a copy for $6.95 shipping).
The program is designed to work with any fax software compatible
with Windows 3.x or Windows 95.

Fax annotation -- Kind of a Post-it note for received faxes,
fax annotation lets you mark 'em up and send 'em back. It's
better than an e-mail message or MAPI fax message because it
allows comments to be affixed directly to the fax image.

Automatic printing -- You're out to lunch, and your computer's
password-protected. Unfortunately, your PC is also the fax
server, and the big cheese is waiting for a fax. When automatic
printing is activated, the problem ends. The phone rings, the
fax arrives, the fax prints out and the boss never notices
you're an hour late.

Fax preview -- This can be a lifesaver. How many times have
you sent a fax, only to realize you clicked the wrong person's
name in your address book? Fax preview lets you see the document
before it's sent. This prevents embarrassing misfires and gives
you a glimpse of how well (or badly) a scanned document will
reproduce by fax.

Improved cover-page editors -- MS Fax's cover-page editor barely
does the job. Delrina's cover-page editor is still the best,
with Hayes a close second.

Features We'd Like to See

By:
Rich Levin

MAPI and TAPI support in every Windows 95 fax program The days
of the standalone fax machine, and standalone fax software,
are over. If it doesn't support MAPI and TAPI, don't buy it.

The ability to reject faxes from certain telephone numbers Most
faxes contain the sender's telephone number in the fax data

It would be easy for fax software developers to add a feature
that captures this number and adds it to a "Rejection List"
on request. Whenever a call comes in from a number on the list,
the fax software would simply disconnect the call.

Standards for cover-page file formats Right now, if you change
fax software, you'll have to re-create all your cover pages.
If fax software vendors were to standardize on a single file
format, users could easily share cover pages.

True mail-merge broadcast fax capability Almost every popular
fax package can replicate a document to a list of names, but
only Microsoft Word and Exchange allow you to customize each
document with merged information.

Color faxes Need I say more?

Automatic printer selection It's about time fax software automatically
returned the "real" printer to the Windows default after sending
a fax.

How To Buy a ... Pointing Device


 
Type

It used to be that mice were the only game in town. But now
you're confronted with myriad choices, including trackballs,
touchpads and more esoteric designs like pointing sticks. Trackballs
and touchpads are the two most popular mouse alternatives.
Trackballs offer a high level of precision and take up less
desktop space than a mousepad. Touchpads provide a flat input
mechanism similar to those on many notebook PCs. However, mice
remain at the top of the list-they still account for about
80 percent of all pointing devices sold.

Buttons

The average mouse has two buttons. However you can buy mice
with up to four buttons that can be programmed as shortcuts
for more complex functions like double-click or Alt+Tab. Consider
a mouse with extra programmable buttons if you work with programs
that go heavy on complicated keyboard commands (such as desktop
publishing or CAD)

Price

A high-quality mouse costs anywhere from $39 to $69, though
you can get lower-resolution units with less-sturdy mechanisms
for as little as $10. Trackballs cost more, from about $65
to $110, while touchpads are priced at about $79 to $99.

Connectors

You can hook your pointing device to your PC using either a
PS/2 or a serial connector. Older computers use a serial connection,
notebook computers need a PS/2 connector, and newer desktop
PCs allow both PS/2 and serial connections. Ideally, your device
should have a converter that's compatible with either type
of port.

Perhaps the trusty mouse you've been using for years has finally
given up the ghost. Or your new system came with a mouse you
just don't like. Whatever sent you searching for a new pointing
device, you'll find dozens of replacement options on store
shelves. You're sure to find a device to suit your needs and
style-some manufacturers are even offering designer hues that
let your true colors shine.

Once upon a time, you had to be concerned about your mouse's
resolution. But today's better rodents offer resolutions of
about 200 counts per inch (cpi), and most good-quality trackballs
have resolutions of between 200 and 400cpi. Touchpad resolutions
often meet or exceed 1,000cpi. You probably won't notice a
significant dip in precision unless you buy a device that features
a resolution of less than 200cpi. You may also see resolution
quoted in the more familiar dots per inch (dpi), but these
numbers mean the same thing as cpi.

Before you commit to a particular model, visit a store with
a demonstration section where you can try each pointing device.
Ask about warranties; some companies offer only a year or two
of coverage, while others offer five years or more.

Tracking Input Trends



The touchpad has already become a familiar item in many notebook
computers, and it looks as if these devices will continue to
storm the market. BIS Strategic Decisions predicts that touchpads
will account for 70 percent of all integrated pointing devices
by 1998. Manufacturers like Alps and Cirque are introducing
desktop touchpads, and are integrating touchpads into all-in
one desktop keyboard units.

These flat pads have a variety of advantages over other pointing
device technologies. The pad is a sealed unit that keeps dirt
out. Touchpads have become popular in notebooks because of
their extremely light weight. They also take up less desktop
space than mice or trackballs. For example, Cirque estimates
that its GlidePoint Desktop, which measures 4.4 by 0.4 by 4
inches, takes up about 70 percent less space than a mousepad.

Touchpad technology is based on electrical capacitance rather
than pressure. The pad contains two layers of electrodes (one
vertical and one horizontal) that are connected to an integrated
circuit within the unit. When you touch the pad, you change
the capacitance of the layers. By coordinating the intersection
of the two layers, the unit moves the cursor precisely. This
technology is extremely intuitive-instead of clicking on a
mouse button, you merely tap on the pad. For those who find
old habits hard to break, most touchpads now on the market
come with two clickable buttons.

Winlab Product Comparisons: The Sound & the Fury: Multimedia Upgrades -- 
Is Installation Easier with Win95? It Can Be-If You Get the Right Hardware

By:
Marc Spiwak

If you bought your PC a couple of years ago, you're probably
multimedia-challenged-sans sound card and CD-ROM drive, but
longing to run the terrific CD-ROMs coming on the market. So
you hike to the computer store, and there they are: brand-new
multimedia upgrade kits with everything you need. Do they work?
Are they easy to get up and running? Good questions.

Installing multimedia hardware under Windows 3.1 used to be
an adventure fraught with conflict and peril. Then vendors
got the kinks ironed out, and upgrading was a comparatively
straightforward affair. Now, with Windows 95, things should
be even easier, right? Well, not always.

In theory, Plug and Play and Win95's installation wizard should
make installation a snap. In practice, we found that some upgrades
are indeed smooth as silk under Windows 95. But other multimedia
kits-Plug and Play or not-are difficult to install. Apparently,
some vendors don't have Plug-and-Play multimedia upgrades ready
just yet, and others rushed to put Plug-and-Play hardware on
store shelves without thoroughly testing it.

It's clearly worthwhile to make sure you upgrade the easy way.
To save you from a downer of an upgrade experience, Windows
Magazine took seven upgrade kits for a test run to see which
live up to the promise of easy installation and great multimedia
performance in Win95. Our review criteria called for a minimum
quad-speed CD-ROM-the de facto standard today. Most of the
kits had 4X drives, although one had a 6X and one-which is
covered in the sidebar on the next page-had an 8X.

The good news is that once they were running, all the kits worked
fine. Even better, two of the kits worked like a charm from
the outset. But, as you'll see, it took some trial and error
to arrive at that point with the other products.

The sample here includes upgrades that will at least support
Windows 95: Some are Plug-and-Play systems, while others are
not. As is often the case, some upgrades support Windows 95
better than others.

All of the cards we tested had built-in IDE ports. On all but
two of the cards, they proved to be useless, because our test
computer system could not recognize the CD-ROM connected to
them.

The majority of multimedia upgrades today come with IDE CD-ROM
drives, and the sound card will usually have an IDE controller
built into it. This makes more sense than proprietary systems,
where the CD-ROM drive must use a particular controller. Such
a drive could not be installed in another machine without using
the original (or a compatible) controller. On the other hand,
an IDE CD-ROM drive can be installed in nearly any computer
and use the motherboard's IDE controller(s). I was very fortunate
that this was the case, because otherwise I would not have
been able to test the majority of these upgrades.

One additional note: If you have an older video card (with perhaps
1MB of DRAM for the video memory or an early SVGA type), you
may want to get an updated card to play videos without dropping
frames. The card in the Gateway 2000 test bed was an ATI mach32,
which played all the videos we tried with no frames dropped.
Similarly, the sound cards in the upgrade kits played video
clip sound without breaks.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Aztech Labs Stellar 6X

By:
Marc Spiwak

Aztech Labs provided the one 6X package in this review. A 6X
drive spins the disc 50 percent faster than a 4X drive. Although
this speed improvement is noticeable, it is not necessary.

After installing the Aztech upgrade in our Gateway 2000 DX2
66, powering up the system and running the Install software
from within Windows 95, I found that I still had no sound and
no D: drive (the IDE CD-ROM). I manually installed the hardware
within Win95 and had it load default software. The sound card
worked-but there was still no D: drive. Connecting the CD-ROM
drive to the motherboard IDE controller solved that problem.

Aztech's upgrade exhibited very ordinary sound quality. Audio
contained static at times, and the speakers had a shrill quality
with the treble boost turned on and somewhat flat sound with
it off. The speakers didn't have much oomph even with batteries
installed.

The Aztech upgrade is an average package, and even its helping
of bundled software leaves a bit to be desired. With only two
multimedia titles included, it had the least software of any
kit tested. But if the 6X speed is more important to you than
having a wealth of software titles, you might like this upgrade.

The speed of the drive tends to place this upgrade kit at the
high end of the spectrum, but its nonwavetable sound card,
unimpressive speakers and small software selection puts it
at the low end. A 6X drive should be strapped to a much better
sound card and speakers. If you're buying only a CD-ROM drive,
then by all means go for a 6X drive. But if you're buying a
complete upgrade package, a better sound card and speakers
contribute much more to overall performance than a speedier
CD-ROM drive.

--Info File--

Aztech Labs Stellar 6X

Price: $379

In Brief: This kit has a slight performance edge with the only
6X drive in the bunch, but is short on accessories and bundled
software.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Creative Labs Sound Blaster Discovery CD 4x

By:
Marc Spiwak

One advantage of a Sound Blaster sound card is that most software,
including Windows 95, recognizes it. This package includes
the Sound Blaster 16 PnP, and Plug and Play it does. This kit
was a breeze to install. Both the sound card and its secondary
IDE controller worked without a hitch in the test-bed Gateway
2000 DX2/66 computer

Once I had the Discovery CD 4x upgrade working, I installed
its handy assortment of utility software, which can be loaded
from included disks or a CD-ROM. Choose the latter: It's easier,
and it gives you a chance to do something productive with your
new CD-ROM drive.

The speakers included with this Discovery CD 4x upgrade are
of average quality. They can be connected to the line output
on the sound card with batteries installed or to the amplified
output with or without batteries. An AC adapter is optional.
General sound from these speakers is fairly full, but audio
CDs sound flat unless you install batteries in the speakers.

These speakers can be used with or without batteries. If batteries
are not used, the speakers must be connected to an amplified
sound-card output or else nothing will be heard. With batteries
installed, they can be connected to either an amplified output
or a line-level output. They sounded much better and more powerful
with batteries installed and connected to the amplified output,
although the sound tended to break up at higher levels. Treble
and bass boost controls on the speakers worked, but both controls
should always be turned on, as the sound was missing some quality
without them.

While this kit's sound quality and amplification power are not
going to knock anyone's socks off, a setup like this is certainly
adequate for most multimedia applications, especially if it's
your first multimedia setup. On the other hand, the easy time
I had installing this kit more than made up for any sonic shortcomings.
And for the multimedia newcomer, nothing is more important
than getting the equipment to work.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Creative Labs Sound Blaster Performance 4x

By:
Marc Spiwak

Of all the kits tested, the Performance 4x is the one that I
would most like to have in my computer because of its superior
32-bit wavetable Sound Blaster sound card. It gave no installation
trouble at all, even to the point that I was able to use the
IDE controller on the sound card. This was the case only with
the Creative Labs upgrade kits.

While the speakers that come with this upgrade were not the
best of the lot, they were certainly adequate, and the better
sound card more than makes up for them. (If you are looking
to save a few dollars, you would probably be just as happy
with the Creative Labs Discovery CD 4x.)

The Performance 4x lacks Plug-and-Play capabilities, so

first I tried running an installation program from DOS. After
this program ran, the computer could access the CD-ROM drive
through the sound card, but there was still no sound. I had
Windows 95 do an auto search for new hardware. The OS "found"
the sound card and its game port, and configured both properly
with default drivers. The reward I got was beautiful sound.

The Performance 4x is the only upgrade tested that includes
a 32-bit sound card, a Sound Blaster 32 to be exact. This wavetable
card is hands down the best sound card in this review. And
while the speakers are not the most powerful in the group,
they are much better than the low-end ones packaged with some
of the other kits. An AC adapter is included. In general, any
speakers powered by an AC adapter will sound better than battery
powered speakers, and you'll never have to buy batteries. An
audio purist might want speakers with a little more power and
perhaps even a subwoofer. That aside, anyone should be very
happy with this kit. A very complete utility software collection
rounds out the package.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Diamond Multimedia Kit 4400

By:
Marc Spiwak

Diamond Multimedia is perhaps best known for high-end products.
We can't argue with that, especially since it was the only
company to submit an 8X upgrade "Speed Demon").  But both the 4X
and 8X Diamond upgrades were the fussiest in terms of getting
them to work in Windows 95.

When I first powered up the Gateway 2000 with the 4400 upgrade
installed, I had no D: drive, which was the normal situation
with these upgrades, and there was no sound.

Eventually the 4400's sound card worked, but only when it was
set for non-Plug-and-Play operation and after running Diamond's
install program from DOS. And that wasn't all. Back in Windows
95, an automatic search failed to detect any of the new hardware.
Manually installing the drivers from within Win95 brought the
sound card to life, but I still couldn't control the CD-ROM
drive from the IDE controller on the sound card. Thankfully,
the controller on the motherboard worked, which generally proved
to be the rule in this review.

The Diamond 4400 produced average sound quality. The sound card
is a 16-bit, non-wavetable type, and the speakers are probably
the least expensive in the lot we tested. These speakers must
be connected to an amplified output on a sound card because
they are not amplified at all. There's no way to use batteries
or an AC adapter, so all of the amplification must come from
the sound card. Although the sound they produce is clear, there's
just not enough of it. Most people would not be happy owning
these speakers, and would probably replace them with something
better soon after installing the upgrade. For the person who
wants to hear only an occasional sound effect or warning beep,
they would suffice, but there's a lot more to multimedia.

In Brief: The kit has plenty of goodies for a very reasonable

Winlab Product Comparisons: Kiss Technology Super Edition

By:
Marc Spiwak

The Kiss Technology Super Edition multimedia upgrade includes
a Pioneer 4X IDE CD-ROM drive, a Plug-and-Play sound card,
a pair of very basic speakers, some generic utility software
and eight assorted CD-ROM titles. You set a jumper on the sound
card to Plug and Play if the system is being installed under
Windows 95 or to Disable Plug and Play if it's being installed
under DOS or Windows 3.11. The sound card also has a built
in secondary IDE controller for the CD-ROM drive.

Documentation for this package was somewhat sparse. Parts of
it pertain to installing under Windows 95 and others don't.
When I installed this upgrade in the Gateway 2000 DX2/66, the
sound card would not play immediately. I had to have Windows
95 search for the new hardware, which it found and set up properly.
I could not get the sound card's IDE controller to work in
the Gateway 2000, so I had to plug the drive into the IDE controller
on the motherboard, which worked.

The speakers can be used without batteries if they are connected
to the sound card's amplified output. In this configuration
they sounded fine, though somewhat "hollow." With six C batteries
installed and the speakers connected to the line output on
the sound card, they sounded about the same, but now I could
use the speakers' volume and bass-boost controls. With batteries
installed and the speakers connected to the sound card's amplified
output, the sound was much fuller and louder. You can plug
in a 9-volt AC adapter, but none is included with this kit.

This upgrade's utility software bundle is generic. In addition,
it does not have an applet that will play audio CDs, so I had
to install the CD-player option as part of Windows 95's Media
Player. That worked just fine, but you have to wonder why this
package lacked a CD player.

In addition, this would be one more hitch for the Win 95 novice,
and perhaps one more reason to call technical support.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Reveal Quad Elite XL

By:
Marc Spiwak

The Quad Elite XL is the upscale version of the two Reveal kits
submitted for review. It has essentially the same hardware
as the lower-end kit, except that it has much better speakers,
a joystick and tons of multimedia software.

After I installed the Elite hardware, I ran the Win95 Install
program. This provided sound, but, of course, the old "no D
 drive" problem cropped up once again. Not being too quick
to abandon the sound card's IDE controller, I tried to have
Windows 95 autodetect the new hardware. Supposedly, the OS
found and configured the new IDE controller, but the machine
was then very slow to reboot and, alas, still no D: drive.

As usual, I had to connect the CD-ROM drive to the motherboard
IDE controller before we could spin any discs. An unexpected
wrinkle appeared with this upgrade kit, too. All the other
drives in this review were set as slaves, but this one was
set as a master, which meant that I had to move the jumper
to the slave position. Then it worked like all the others.
Although this was not something to worry about, had I not made
the switch, I would have spent a lot of time wondering why
the drive wasn't responding.

As far as sound quality goes, this upgrade kit can really put
out the sound. The AC-powered speakers pack quite a punch with
40 watts per channel. Only a subwoofer would make the sound
any fuller. The trade-off for that power is space: The speakers
take up a lot more room on your desktop than the others reviewed.
This was the only upgrade I tested that can transform your
PC into a home stereo (for CDs at least), and it's also the
only one that might cause coworkers to yell, "Turn down that
computer!" The wavetable sound card, while not 32-bit, produces
clear, realistic MIDI sound and good FM synthesis. The powerful
speakers coupled with the wavetable sound card make for a very
pleasing multimedia setup that you could live with for a long
time.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Reveal Quad Ultra

By:
Marc Spiwak

The Reveal Quad Ultra upgrade is loaded with accessories, including
many software titles, a how-to-install videotape, a microphone
and headphones. The speakers included with the Quad Ultra could
easily find a long-term home on your desk. They're not high
end, but they look nice, sound very good and come with an AC
adapter.

The Reveal upgrades include some of the best documentation of
any of the kits I examined. For example, a neat little supplement
explaining IDE controllers was thrown in. The supplement shows
how IDE conflicts can occur, how to test for IDE controllers
on your motherboard and so on. It provided substantial background
material on what might cause problems with an IDE installation.

But even with its excellent documentation, the Reveal Quad Ultra
upgrade presented the most bizarre installation problem of
all. After I installed the hardware and connected the CD-ROM
to the sound card, the Gateway 2000 DX2/66 wouldn't even boot.
After much experimentation, I found that the machine would
boot if I first entered the CMOS setup and then simply exited
it. Then the computer booted just fine but, as usual, gave
no indication of a D: drive connected to the sound card.

The computer also failed to boot after shutting down Windows
95 and turning off the power; it needed the little CMOS setup
trick. Strangely, if I merely had Win95 restart itself (no
power down), it would boot up again just fine. This dilemma
continued as long as I left the CD-ROM drive connected to the
sound card's IDE controller. Disconnecting the CD-ROM drive
solved the problem, as did using the motherboard IDE controller.
(Apparently, the Gateway 2000's BIOS strongly disliked something
about this upgrade!)

Once the hardware problems were straightened out, the Quad Ultra
upgrade was trouble-free. The Install disks worked properly
from within Windows 95, and I soon had sound. Overall, this
upgrade's sound quality was good compared to some of the other
kits tested, due to the better speakers and the wavetable sound
card. The card produces realistic sound, and the speakers reproduce
that sound clearly. The speakers, while not earthshaking, are
more than adequate for most business multimedia applications.
But again, audio purists will want more power.

You'll be happy with any of these multimedia upgrades once you
get them working properly in your computer. And it's quite
possible that you would have no trouble installing any one
of them in your computer. It's also possible that you might
have trouble with one of the ones we liked. It depends greatly
on your computer setup, and at this point anything could happen.
Whatever you do, don't let our cautions ruin your appetite
for multimedia. There's an exciting new world of software out
there, and it's just waiting for you to get the right hardware
to run it.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Speed Demon -- Fast is great, but easy is better.

By:
Marc Spiwak

Speed-people can never get enough of it. Not in amusement parks,
not in cars and certainly not in CD-ROM drives. The first CD
ROM drives would spin a disc at the same speed as an audio
CD player, which was unbearably slow. Next came double-speed
drives that transferred data at double the speed of ordinary
drives. You could buy triple-speed drives briefly, but they
vanished soon after quad speed drives became available-which
seemed like only days after the 3X drives came out.

Quad-speed drives are fairly standard today, as they are quite
fast (at least compared to 2X) and very reasonable in price.
It should come as no surprise that 6X and even 8X drives are
now available. While a 6X drive spins a disc 50 percent faster
than a 4X, an 8X is twice as fast! That would make for a really
slick multimedia upgrade. We reviewed one 6X kit (an Aztech),
and an 8X kit almost made it.

The Diamond Multimedia Kit 8000, with an 8X drive included,
is a rather expensive upgrade (about $599 street), but it's
also probably the fastest one around. Although I spent the
better part of a day trying to make it work, it never operated
completely on the test-bed system. Diamond said it was busy
working on new drivers and Install disks that should clear
up the problems I experienced.

While awaiting the new software's arrival, I tested the 8X IDE
drive by itself connected to the motherboard's IDE controller.
By CD-ROM standards the drive cooks, transferring data at 1.2Mb
per second. I copied a huge file from the 8X drive to the hard
drive in about half the time of the 4X drives tested, which
was pretty much what we expected.

The new drivers didn't make installing the upgrade in the Gateway
2000 DX2/66 test-bed machine any easier. While the 8X upgrade
never worked in that machine, all the other kits eventually
did. The 8X upgrade kit did work in a brand-new Pentium 133
with a working Plug-and-Play BIOS, installing in this machine
with no problems at all. That was very satisfying, but it's
highly unlikely that anyone would be installing new multimedia
hardware in a new computer.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Installation Tips -- First, you have to 
make it work.

By:
Marc Spiwak

I ran into many problems getting these multimedia upgrades to
work, apparently because installation software has not yet
been thoroughly tested under Windows 95, and Plug-and-Play
drivers often aren't available. But there are a few tricks
that can be helpful in getting new multimedia hardware to work
in Windows 95.

IDE Problems

The upgrade kits all include IDE CD-ROM drives and have secondary
IDE controllers on their sound cards. IDE controllers are easy
to use, except when they conflict with another IDE controller,
or the BIOS thinks there's another controller or the Install
software fails to configure the new controller properly. Mostly,
the sound-card function worked correctly, but the CD-ROM drives
were unresponsive.

Controlling the CD-ROM drive as a slave from the motherboard's
IDE controller solved the problem. Tech support suggested this.

Disabling the sound card's IDE controller leaves the computer
in its original configuration. You can't do this if the motherboard
has only one IDE controller installed with two hard drives
connected to it. But if you need only one hard drive, it's
better to have only one controller operating. Unnecessary controllers
eat up memory.

The ribbon cable connecting the hard drive to the motherboard's
IDE controller had a spare connector. If this is not the case,
you'll need a new ribbon cable with two connectors, not a big
deal, but certainly a hassle. Had the Gateway 2000 test computer
already had a slave drive connected to the primary IDE controller,
I would have had to connect the new drive to the motherboard's
secondary IDE controller.

Try, Try Again

The instruction manuals mostly discussed installation in Windows
3.11; the same procedure often doesn't work in Windows 95.
Check your documentation for specific Win95 installation instructions,
and follow them. Sometimes you just have to boot Windows 95,
and it will automatically detect and configure your new hardware
with its own default software. This ideal situation did not
occur often.

If the instructions tell you to start the Install procedure
in DOS, then you should start your computer in Win95's DOS
mode and try running Install from there. If that doesn't work,
try using the Run command line in Windows 95. When you have
run all the install procedures available and the new hardware
still isn't responding, try having Windows 95 automatically
detect the new hardware.

Should Windows detect the hardware, it might configure it automatically.
Or it might ask you to insert a manufacturer's disk containing
drivers or information about the new hardware. First insert
any disk that might be an obvious choice. Or, you could try
having Windows look at each disk one at a time.

Your new hardware must be configured manually if Windows fails
to detect it. At this point, you must notify the Add New Hardware
Wizard that you will tell it what to look for.

Last Resort

If you have tried everything you can think of but still cannot
get the hardware to work, you can uninstall Windows 95, go
back to 3.11, install the hardware from there, and then reinstall
Win95. The new OS sometimes sets up hardware better while it
is installing itself. It simply copies the earlier, workable
installation setup.

Finally, Windows 95 can install properly and have all hardware
working, only to reconfigure some device automatically later
on so that it no longer works. So, if you upgrade to Windows
95 and all your hardware is working correctly, disable the
"Make settings automatically" box for all system hardware.
This means Windows won't be able to juggle around those "locked"
resources in the future, but as long as they are properly doled
out today, you're okay! Should problems persist, try disabling
each statement in your CONFIG.SYS file, and then reenabling
only what you need to get everything to work reliably.

How We Tested: The Multimedia Microscope -- It's a question of installation
ease, sound quality and drive speed.

By:
Marc Spiwak

We decided to test the Plug and Play upgrades in an older machine
without a Plug and Play BIOS, so that we would duplicate the
situation that most readers would have. We first tried an old
AST 33MHz 486. After experiencing various CD-ROM install problems
with the first three upgrades, we decided to try a slightly
newer Gateway 2000 DX2/66. Ironically, the first three Plug
and Play sound cards all worked fine in the AST, but not in
the Gateway 2000. We had no better luck with the sound card
IDE controllers in the Gateway 2000, either. By this time we
realized that the problems were caused mostly by the upgrades,
and not by our computers. So we decided to stick with the Gateway
2000.

To ensure that the upgrade kits started on level ground, we
tested each in a clean installation of Windows 95. That way,
nothing remaining from a previous test would interfere. To
do this, we ran a batch file that renamed the old Windows subdirectory
and then completely reinstalled Windows in a new subdirectory.
That left us with a fresh, bare-bones installation of Windows
95 every time.

After we had an upgrade working properly (the main focus of
this article), we simply loaded the included software and listened
to what it could do. Our opinions on the overall sound quality
of these upgrades are purely objective. Although you might
not agree with them, you can use them as starting points. For
the performance aspects, we did identical tests for each upgrade
and measured the time it took for each one to complete.

We ran a program that played an AVI file from the CD-ROM drive
included with the upgrade kit and counted the number of frames
dropped while the video played. Our tests indicated that if
you have a 486 or better computer and are installing at least
a 4X CD-ROM drive (our minimum speed requirement for this review),
you will have no video frames dropped from AVI files. None
of our test systems dropped frames.

We also tested CD-ROM drive speed while searching and transferring
data to another drive. For each upgrade kit, we searched for
the same information (Open GL and Windows NT) on the Microsoft
Developer Network CD-ROM and timed the operation. In addition,
we copied the Weezer video on the Windows 95 CD-ROM to the
hard drive. On a 4X drive, the copy time averaged about a minute.

Report Card: Recommendations

By:
Marc Spiwak

The Creative Labs' upgrade kits are the only way to go at this
time for painless compatibility. This is the primary reason
that they garnered the WINDOWS Magazine Recommended seal. These
were the only upgrades that worked as advertised right out
of the box, and contained the only CD-ROM drives that could
be driven from the sound card's built-in IDE controller. Either
of them would be fine. However, if you want wavetable synthesis,
which can deliver more realistic sound depending on the source
material, opt for the Creative Labs Sound Blaster Performance
4x upgrade. The Performance 4x package includes the Sound Blaster
32 which, in addition to being a wavetable synthesis card,
delivers better overall sound quality with its 32-bit operation.
One minor complaint with this upgrade is that we would have
liked more powerful speakers, or perhaps a subwoofer, attached
to the Sound Blaster 32. That sound card is certainly worthy
of high-end speakers. If we could have mixed and matched components,
we probably would have used the Reveal Quad Elite speakers
with the Performance 4x upgrade.

Winlab Product Comparisons: A Gaggle of Gigs That Won't Break the Bank -- Add 
Big Storage for Only a Few Bucks

By:
Serdar Yegulalp and Philip Albinus

"A gig for a grand" was a catch phrase for PC buyers as little
as a year and a half ago. Now a gigabyte drive is de rigueur
for new PCs. And users looking to upgrade their current systems
are gravitating toward these drives as well, drawn by retail
prices that have dropped into the $350 range.

In this review, we examine four 1GB EIDE hard drives from the
bigger players in the field: Seagate Technology, Western Digital,
Quantum and Fujitsu Computer Products of America. Conner Peripherals
also sent us a drive, but we didn't include it because Conner
provided us with only volume OEM pricing information.

Each drive was tested on a 100MHz 486 Pentium equipped with
an Award Plug-and-Play BIOS. We used WINDOWS Magazine's brand
new Wintune 95 to test the drive's cached and uncached performance.
We also placed approximately 300MB worth of text files onto
the drive and indexed them with Microsoft Office 95's Find
Fast Indexer. We then used Microsoft Word 7.0 to perform a
context search for the word "and." Since the index itself took
up several megabytes, the drive's own hardware-level caching
and retrieval speed got a thorough testing.

You may wonder why, with costs dropping the way they are, we
didn't review even larger drives than 1.2GB. We could have,
but users who opt for such monster drives running under Windows
95 could wind up having too much of a good thing.

Virtual File Allocation Table (VFAT), Windows 95's souped-up
version of the old DOS FAT file system, limits the maximum
size of individual drive volumes to 2GB.

The problem isn't fatal. If you buy a 4GB drive, for instance,
you can use all of it properly under Windows 95 by partitioning
it into at least two drives, each of them 2GB or less in size.

By comparison, NTFS, the file system incorporated into Windows
NT, has a maximum individual volume size of 16 billion gigabytes.
(Yes, 16 billion!) That's surely large enough for most Windows
applications.

So if you find yourself routinely working with volumes larger
than 2GB, and you are dealing with data that requires a fair
degree of fault tolerance (mirroring, striping and extended
partition data), you're better off switching to Windows NT.
NTFS has many safety, redundancy and large-volume handling
features that may make it the OS of choice in that situation.

Also note that EIDE drives larger than 528MB may not be recognized
by a computer with an old BIOS. Some of them require software
drivers to handle this problem, such as Ontrack's Disk Manager.
(See sidebar "Enhancing Your Hard Drive" for more on this.)
Other computers may simply need a BIOS upgrade. Contact your
machine's manufacturer to get the straight dope. And know your
system's limitations before spending money for something you
can't use.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Fujitsu M1614



If a hard drive can be called sexy, then the Fujitsu M1614 deserves
the description. Housed in a sleek black case that dramatically
complements the chrome-finished hard-drive mechanism, the Fujitsu
M1614 was the least expensive hard drive we tested. However,
this low-priced drive is still a worthy performer.

Fujitsu has apparently not paid as much attention to the drive's
insides as it has to its "come hither" exterior. It's true
that the unit finished last in the Microsoft Word search, with
an average time of almost 9 minutes, but in the Wintune 95
tests, the Fujitsu M1614 scored a 6.8MB per second in the cached
test and a flat 2MB per second in the uncached test, which
were average numbers in this review. All told, the M1614 finished
second in the Wintune testing, bested only by Quantum. It earned
a "B" for performance.

The Fujitsu M1614 has screw holes on the side and bottom portions
for easy side- and flat-mounting.

Because Fujitsu did not send a manual with the unit, we were
unable to review the documentation.

--Info File--

Fujitsu M1614

Price: $235

In Brief: Fujitsu's drive is the least expensive in this review,
putting a speedy gigabyte within the grasp of most users.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Quantum Fireball 1080



Quantum's excellent Fireball line of drives is well represented
by the 1080, which features stellar performance and solid support.
It was the only drive in the bunch rated for a 500,000-hour
mean time between failures. Jumper settings are printed on
the drive's faceplate, although the jumper itself is on the
drive controller board (and consequently a little hard to find
at first glance). The drive design has the controller placed
entirely outside the chassis, connected to the drive mechanism
via a detachable ribbon cable. This allows easy removal and
replacement of the controller in the event it fails. Both horizontal
and vertical mounting are supported.

Quantum's spiral-bound manual is excellent and thorough, although
it desperately needs to be updated: The revision we received
was dated November 1994 and didn't have specific data for the
Fireball 1080. It was easy enough to get the drive installed
and running, however, and the manual is still full of useful
information, right down to the part numbers for the correct
screws to use when mounting the drive horizontally or vertically.

The Fireball's performance scores were consistently high when
it came to cached performance (6.7MB per second); when dealing
with uncached data it only delivered 2.1MB per second on the
average. It performed spectacularly well in the word-search
test, raking through the data on the disk in an average of
7 minutes flat.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Seagate Medalist 1080sl



Slimmer and lighter than the other drives we reviewed, the Seagate
Medalist stands out in many ways.

The full itinerary of jumper settings is spelled out on the
drive's faceplate, making it easy to get the drive hooked up
and talking to your system. Screw holes on the drive's sides
and underside facilitate side- and flat-mounting. The gasket
around the drive's edge is sealed tightly with tape as an extra
precaution against contamination. Apparently, this also has
some noise-abatement value: The drive's noise rating is a very
acceptable 30dB.

The manual contains a wealth of illustrations that spell out
drive installation and configuration in plain terms. Despite
the simple language, the manual is also quite technical. The
back is chock-full of tables on such esoterica as low-level
PIO mode programming, but the overly technical information
doesn't hamper learning how to hook up and prepare the drive.

In Wintune 95, Seagate's uncached performance registered a 2MB
per second, and it scored a respectable 7.1MB per second in
cached performance. However, it came in third in the word-search
test, with an 8-minute, 42-second average.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Western Digital Caviar AC21000



Accept only the finest," reads the slogan on the faceplate.
Western Digital's Caviar certainly lives up to that motto by
being one of the finest hard drives on the market today.

Open the box for Western Digital's hard drive kit, and you're
greeted with goodies that simplify the chore of installing
a new hard drive. Along with the instructions, a wall chart
spells out every stage of the installation procedure with clean,
straightforward, captioned illustrations. The manual itself
is every bit as good, written in clear English and also illustrated
(and the chart's not simply a rehash of the manual's illustrations).
Troubleshooting, variable hardware setups and multiple operating
systems are all covered.

The jumper settings aren't spelled out explicitly, but the exposed
circuit board traces for the jumpers have the letters CS, MA
and SL (for cable select, master and slave) etched on them.
The drive's gasket is also sealed with tape all the way around
(and emblazoned with the stern warning "Warranty Void If Removed").
Screw holes in the chassis allow the drive to be mounted horizontally
or vertically, depending on the computer's case.

The Caviar's cached and uncached performance were both average
for this review: 6.7MB per second and 3MB per second, respectively.
The Caviar's handling of the word-search test was second best,
rating 8 minutes, 30 seconds, slightly ahead of the Seagate.

Also included are Ontrack Computer Systems' Disk Manager and
DriveRocket utilities. Disk Manager provides compatibility
for 1GB drives with older system BIOSes, and Drive Rocket enhances
drive performance through caching. Windows 95 users should
not use Drive Rocket, since it interferes with Windows 95's
own disk caching.

Western Digital Caviar AC21000

Price: $300 (street)

In Brief: The Caviar drive comes with a poster that details
every step of the installation. It also is equipped with Ontrack's

Winlab Product Comparisons: The Easy Way to Install a Hard Drive -- 
A step-by-step approach to upgrading

By:
Serdar Yegulalp

1. Check your system. Check your machine's manual to find out
where internal drives get mounted and make sure there's room.
If there isn't, consider temporarily removing one of the other
drives, especially if you can consolidate your data. For instance,
the data on a pair of 250MB drives could fit comfortably into
a 1GB drive with room to spare.

The power supply should have at least one free four-wire lead.
If it doesn't, your local computer store sells splitters which,
like extension cords for wall outlets, can be used to make
two power leads out of one. Also, make sure you're not overloading
your supply. Each device connected to the power supply, and
the supply itself, should have a wattage rating printed on
it. For safety's sake, the connected devices' power ratings
should not be more than about 90 percent of the supply's rating.
It's not likely that you'll even get close unless you have
an older machine with a small power supply (less than 200W)
and lots of peripherals installed.

2. Take precautions. Static electricity, which builds up in
your body constantly, can destroy computer equipment. Hard
drives are among the most static-sensitive devices. You can
defeat static buildup by running a humidifier, wearing antistatic
gloves or working on an antistatic computer mat. Or simply
touch a piece of exposed metal on the computer's case every
few minutes during the installation. This will ground you out
and drain static away.

3. have the right hardware. Mounting rails and/or brackets should
be shipped with the drives, but are needed only if you're putting
a 3.5-inch hard drive into a 5.25-inch bay. If your drive didn't
ship with the necessary hardware, contact the manufacturer
or call a computer parts warehouse, most of which stock hardware
for various drive brands. Also, make sure you use the correct
sized screws. A screw that's too large will go too deep and
may damage the drive.

4. Get connected. Power cables plug in only one way, but some
hard drive data cables (multiconductor ribbon cables) are not
indexed. Fortunately, the cable always has a red stripe indicating
where to match the first pin on the drive's connector.

If you're attaching a drive to an IDE chain that already has
a drive on it (there are two connectors per cable), make sure
you set one drive as a master and the other as a slave. Consult
your drive's instructions about how to do this; usually, it
requires a jumper setting. If there's only one drive on a chain,
it should be set to a neutral setting (often called "cable
select" or "jumper storage"). Setting it wrong may cause your
machine to fail to boot or to give inaccurate drive readings.
Leave the cover off the first time you power up again, in case
there's a problem.

5. Configure it right. Each computer has a different method
for identifying a new hard drive. Some machines require you
to force detection in BIOS setup; some handle it automatically.
Any machine that can accept an IDE drive off the motherboard
should have some kind of autoconfiguration.

Winlab Product Comparisons: Enhancing Your Hard Drive -- 
You may need more stuff to make it all work.

By:
John Gartner

If you've got an old PC, adding a fast, spacious hard drive
may require some additional hardware and software. Unfortunately,
trial and error is the only sure way to find out if your PC
is ready for one of these Enhanced IDE drives. If after formatting
it and updating your BIOS, your new drive works as expected,
great. If not, then your system was probably manufactured before
the summer of '94, when new drivers and controllers became
available.

EIDE, or Fast-ATA drives as they are also called, should have
an EIDE disk controller. EIDE extends the original IDE interface
by supporting drives larger than 528MB (an old DOS and BIOS
limitation), and faster data transfers of up to 16.6MB per
second, in what are known as PIO Modes 3 and 4.

The 528MB limitation (see Power Windows, February 1995) is a
result of the way the operating system (DOS) and the hardware
(through the system BIOS) store and communicate data based
on the sector, head and cylinder location. New systems that
include an updated BIOS and EIDE drive controllers no longer
have this limitation. To work with legacy systems, drive manufacturers
bundle driver software (such as EZ-Drive or Disk Manager) that
translates the larger drive capacities into a format that DOS
and older BIOSes can understand.

To get the faster speed on a non-EIDE system, you'll need some
new hardware. An ISA-bus EIDE card will let you attach larger
hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives, but data transfers are
limited to IDE speeds of 3.3MBps, which is really a limitation
of the ISA bus. For the best performance, look for a PCI or
VL-Bus EIDE controller (depending on the type of slots in your
system). If your PC doesn't have local bus slots, it might
be time to consider upgrading.

One note about adding a second hard drive under Windows 95:
New hard drives must still be partitioned and formatted before
they can be used. You partition the drive by running Fdisk
from a DOS window; this sets the size of the logical volume(s)
that you want on the drive. After Fdisk finishes, you must
format the drive, either by running Format from the command
line or right-clicking on the drive icon and selecting it.
Hard drives are not listed in Add New Hardware (under Control
Panel)

This sounds complicated, but take heart. Some drive manufacturers
bundle these functions into a utility that handles all the
steps automatically.

Report Card: Recommendations 


The race was tight all around, but the clear performance winner
is the Quantum Fireball. With both its performance and its
500,0000-hour MTBF rating, it's no surprise more and more OEMs
are bundling it with their systems. And at $265, its price
is comparable to just about any other drive out there.

The other drives had a lot going for them, too. We especially
liked Western Digital's step-by-step installation poster. Seagate's
light, compact, efficient and noise-reducing design should
appeal to those who need a utilitarian system design. Fujitsu's
drive is a great buy for someone who needs a gig for under
$250.

Performance: How well does the drive perform against the others
reviewed here?

Construction/design: Is the drive well constructed? Are the
jumper settings difficult to change? Is the drive configuration
only explained in the manual, or is it also on other installation
aids?

Support: Is the documentation clear and precise? Does the drive
come with all the necessary materials (rails, brackets, screws,
jumpers and so forth)? Does the manufacturer stand behind its
product (toll-free support, BBSes, Web or ftp sites, information
service forums?

Optimizing Windows: Explorer Gives You the Big Picture

By:
John Woram

STILL NOT SATISFIED with Explorer? Here are a few more ways
to coax it into doing what you want.

In last month's explanation of the Explorer /n command, I noted
the /n switch opens a new window each time you execute the
command via the Start menu's Run option. (If you don't see
the subsequent windows opening, drag the top window around.
The others are hiding underneath it.) You may or may not see
a similar effect if you open an Explorer window by double-clicking
on the My Computer icon and opening additional folders within
it depends on how you've configured the Folder tab. Open Explorer's
View menu and select

Options to view the tab, which appears ahead of View and File
Types. When you execute Explorer via the Run command without
the /n switch, you'll see only the View and File Types tabs.

The Folder tab offers multiple- and single-window browse options.
The former opens a new window each time you open a new folder;
the latter shows a single window whose panes change as you
open each new folder.

I'll use the multiple-window option to present an overview of
some Explorer features, and show how they compare with the
old File Manager and the still-older DOS directory tree. For
comparison, I'll use the Start menu's Run option. If you want
to follow along, open the following Explorer view window:

explorer /e, /root,

With no object following the /root switch (but don't overlook
that comma), the All Folders pane shows the Desktop as its
root. Click on the plus sign next to My Computer to see the
beginnings of a "directory tree" that shows all your disk drives.
Click on the plus sign next to any drive letter and the tree
expands by one level. Then click on the plus sign next to any
folder on the selected drive, and the tree expands by one more
level, and so on. As you open more folders, the highest level
of the tree disappears off the top of the pane, so that you
can see each new folder as it's opened.

The All Folders pane in the sidebar "A Tree Grows in Explorer
Land" shows a seven-level tree, with some folders removed so
you can see the entire tree. The Contents pane shows the seventh
level-the half-dozen shortcut icons in the highlighted open
folder you see in the All Folders pane. The title bar at the
top of the window shows the equivalent DOS prompt that would
take you to the same level of the tree.

Explorer /n, /root,

If you remove the /e switch, Explorer opens in single-pane Open
view mode. Now open Explorer with /n, /root, and select the
Separate Window radio button from the folder tab in the View
Options menu. From there, double-click on the My Computer icon.
From this window double-click on the drive C: icon, and from
within that window double-click on the Windows folder. From
there double-click on Start Menu, then Programs, then any folder.
Resize/reposition each window so that when you're done, you
can see all seven windows.

Now, with all these Explorer windows open, let's navigate from
one to another. Assuming you can see parts of all seven windows,
the fastest way to get to the desired one is to move your mouse
pointer into that window and click once. Or, to go window browsing,
use the Backspace and Enter keys to work your way in either
direction through all the open windows. Note, however, that
the Backspace key won't take you all the way to the top. If
you press this key while the My Computer window is highlighted,
a message warns you: You Are at the Top Level and Cannot Go
Up Another Level. To See the Desktop, Minimize Any Open Windows.

Well, if you're at the top level, what's that Desktop window
doing one level above the top? No explanation comes to mind,
but if you want that Desktop window, move the mouse pointer
into it, click once and you're there. You won't see this highest
level Desktop window at all if you start the sequence by double
clicking on the My Computer icon. In this case, My Computer
is the highest-level Explorer window on the desktop, so the
message makes more sense. In either case, if you want to get
back to a clean desktop screen, minimize or close all open
windows.

To minimize all windows, right-click on an empty area on the
taskbar and select the Minimize All Windows option on the pop
up menu. You'll probably wind up with a taskbar filled with
uninformative C:\WIN ... buttons. If so, expand the taskbar
so the buttons take up two or more rows, with a bit more information
in each one. Or, move it to either side of the screen and expand
it horizontally so you can see the entire button text. Both
alternatives are space-wasters, though, so you may prefer to
leave the taskbar at its default size. Then, just move the
mouse pointer over the taskbar's button and the full text pops
up immediately above it.

To restore all open windows, again right-click on any empty
area of the taskbar, and this time you'll find an Undo Minimize
All option on the menu.

You can, of course, close selected windows by clicking on the
close button in the upper right corner of the appropriate window(s).
Or, you can close any window and all higher-level windows by
holding down the Shift key when you click.

Explorer /n, /select,\\

My Computer, C:

This Explorer window should look familiar. It's what you see
when you double-click on the desktop's My Computer icon, except
in this example the drive C: icon is highlighted. If you've
already opened My Computer, execute this command to open a
second copy of that window. If you execute this command first,
opening My Computer doesn't open a new window. This is because
the /n switch used here applies to this command line only.
To verify this, try opening My Computer more than once. You'll
find that only one window with that name appears, but a new
window opens each time you use the Run option to execute the
Explorer command. Again, each new window opens on top of the
previous one. If you drag one to the side, though, you'll see
the previous window hiding beneath it.

Once you're reasonably familiar with all these Explorer switches,
you can drag a few Explorer icons onto the desktop and customize
each one to suit your needs. For example, if you regularly
work within the Windows folder, and especially in the Start
menu area, Alt+click on any Explorer shortcut icon, select
Properties and click on the Shortcut tab. Now type the following
string on the Target line:

Explorer /e, /root,C:\Windows,Start Menu\Programs

For further customization, click on the Change Icon button and
select the open-folder icon, or whatever icon suits you. Then
click on the OK button, on the Apply button and again on the
OK button to close the dialog box. As a final touch, rename
the shortcut as Windows Folder.

The next time you double-click on this customized shortcut icon,
the Explorer Folders pane will show an open Programs folder.
If you scroll to the top of the pane you'll see that its root
object is the Windows folder. In this case, the All Folders
legend at the top of the Folders pane is misleading, because
all folders are not available in the pane. You can access only
the C:\Windows folder and its subfolders. If you try to backspace
your way to a higher level, nothing will happen.

In doing these experiments, you need only type the word Explorer
followed by whatever switches you want. When you press the
Apply button, Windows 95 rewrites the line as C:\WINDOWS\EXPLORER.EXE
but leaves your switches intact. Note that the first switch
is separated from EXPLORER.EXE by only a space, and that a
comma follows each switch. In some cases, you can omit the
comma after the final switch. If you encounter a meaningless
error message while experimenting, it's probably the result
of a punctuation error. Also remember that an object and subobject
are separated by a comma, not a backslash.

Once you get the hang of it, you'll find it's reasonably easy
to create one or more Explorer windows that open to show just
what you want to see. After you find the right switch combination,
just create a shortcut and enter the desired command string
in its Target line area.

If you miss the good old days when File Manager could show multiple
directories within its window, open multiple Explorer windows
and tile them horizontally or vertically. You'll find these
tiling options on the taskbar's Shortcut menu. This isn't as
handy as the old File Manager technique, but it's not necessary
once you get used to the Explorer way of doing things.

Remember too, that File Manager is not dead; it's just sleeping.
To wake it up, just execute winfile via the Start menu's Run
option. And you may want to do just that from time to time,
because the older applet has a few nice features that didn't
make it into Explorer. For example, File Manager gives every
file's actual size, while Explorer reports file size by rounding
up to the nearest 1KB boundary. Thus, Explorer reports files
from 1 to 1,024 bytes as 1KB and a 1,025-byte file as 2KB.
Also, Explorer doesn't reveal file attributes. If you highlight
a single file, Explorer reports its actual size on the status
bar. But if you want to see file attributes, you need to highlight
the file and right-click to display its Properties dialog box.
It's all very elegant, but in this case I think the older style
was more user-friendly.

Spend a little time flipping Explorer's switches, and you may
find less and less need to sneak back to File Manager.

Getting Started: Whither Goeth, Oh Nobel File?

By:
Jim Boyce

AH, THE GOOD OL' DAYS! Pardon me as I reminisce about the days
of yore when DOS was king and the usurper, Windows 1.x, was
little more than a fumbling court jester. Long dead are the
days when noble, nerdly knights stout of heart and long in
the tooth did battle against the demons of Lost Data and File
Corruption. Oh, to return to those days of magic and wonder
when only the most cryptic of commands would unlock the mysteries
of your computer's hard drive and let you sift through the
file treasures buried within.

Okay, maybe those good ol' days are best left in the Dark Ages
from whence they came. Once I cast off that shroud of fond
remembrance, I recall that using DIR, COPY and SORT to manage
a load of files was as much fun as riding a tired nag into
battle with a broadax and pike, sans the titanium long johns.

In today's battle of the files, Explorer and File Manager are
the only weapons you need. Each makes quick work of copying,
moving and deleting groups of files. For the uninitiated, they
transform file management from an incomprehensible task into
a point-and-click breeze. This month, I'll explain a few ways
you can make File Manager and Explorer easier to use.

Q: I was able to customize the toolbar in Windows for Workgroups'
File Manager, with buttons for displaying files in Size, Date,
Type and Name order. I miss that feature in Windows 95's Explorer.
Although I can do the same thing from Explorer's View menu,
it seems like so many unnecessary steps. Is there another way
to do this?

A: It's certainly helpful to be able to sort files based on
those properties. If you need to free up some space on your
hard drive, for instance, it makes sense to sort files by size.
With the biggest files on top, you can find and delete the
fattest ones first. Unfortunately, Explorer doesn't include
buttons for each option in its toolbar. But there is a quick
way to sort.

First, set Explorer to display a detailed list by choosing View
Details. The Contents pane changes to show a column for each
of the four fields. To sort by a particular characteristic,
click on that field's header. To switch between ascending and
descending order, just click on the header again. If you're
still longing for File Manager, click on the Start button,
choose Run, enter winfile in the Run dialog box and click on
OK.

Q:I'm not sure I understand how Explorer and File Manager decide
whether to copy a file or move it. If I drag a file from the
C: drive to the D: drive, for instance, I've copied the file.
How can I control how the file is handled?

A: In File Manager and Explorer, you can copy and drag files
within the same drive or from one drive to another. In File
Manager, you can drag a file onto a directory in the tree (from
the right pane to the left pane) or onto a drive icon in the
toolbar. In Explorer, you can drag files from the contents
pane to the same drive or a different drive in the tree. Both
programs use the same criteria to determine whether to copy
or move the file. If you drag the file from one place to another
within the same drive, Windows moves the file. Drag the file
to a different drive, and Windows copies the file.

It's easy to control the files you drag in both File Manager
and Explorer. Hold down Shift while you drag files if you want
to move them. Hold down Ctrl as you drag files if you want
to copy them. The same principles apply when you're working
with single-pane windows (folder windows) in Windows 95. For
example, if you hold down Shift and left-drag an object from
a folder to the Desktop, you move rather than copy the item
to the Desktop.

Q:How can I select more than one file at a time? Each time I
click on a different file, the one I previously selected becomes
deselected.

A: This is one of those basic Windows techniques Microsoft tends
to assume you know, but which isn't obvious. To select a single
object (such as a file), just click on it. To select multiple
objects, hold down Ctrl and click on the objects one at a time.
To deselect an object, hold down Ctrl and click on the object
again. To select a range of objects, select the first one in
the range, hold down Shift, and select the last one. All the
objects in between the selections will then be highlighted.

Now the tricky part: What if you have multiple items selected
and also want to choose a range? Just hold down Ctrl and click
on the first object in the range. Then, while still holding
down Ctrl, hold down Shift and click on the last object in
the range. The original set of objects will remain selected,
and the new range will also be selected.

After you've highlighted the items you want to work with, release
Ctrl and Shift, click on any one of the selected objects and
drag it to its destination. The other selected objects will
follow.

Q: I've noticed that in Explorer and in file dialog boxes (like
the Open dialog box), filenames are sometimes spaced widely
apart. The spacing seems to change from one folder to another.
Why is that?

A: When you use the Small Icons or List view in a folder or
in Explorer, the spacing between one column of filenames and
the next is defined by the longest file or subfolder name in
the folder. Windows 95 allocates enough space in each column
to hold the longest name in the folder. So, if the filenames
are short, the columns are close together. But name a file
with a long filename, and the columns get further apart. Unfortunately,
there really isn't anything you can do to bring the columns
closer together other than shorten the longest filenames.

Q: When I open File Manager, most of the directories appear
empty. I know the files are there, because my programs are
still working. What's wrong?

A: File Manager probably is trying to display files only with
a particular file name or extension. Choose View/By File Type
to open the By File Type dialog box. Type *.* in the Name text
box, then place a check in each of the check boxes in the File
Type group. Choose OK or press Enter, and the files should
reappear.

Power Windows: Data Backups to Make Mom Proud

By:
Karen Kenworthy

Most Moms Today won't let their kids watch TV until they back
up their computer data. As grown-ups, we have to be careful
not to ignore this lesson ourselves.

Hardware failures are rare, but when hardware goes, it often
takes computer data with it. Everyone knows software is fallible,
too. I'm sure at some point you've watched helplessly as an
errant program consumed several days' hard work. And don't
forget fire, theft and computer viruses. You may even have
heard the rumor about the hapless user who made a mistake and
destroyed data all by himself. It's probably an urban legend,
but it's scary just the same.

Fortunately, storing a recent copy of your computer data safely
away from your computer enables you to recover from all these
disasters with minimal inconvenience and only a slight elevation
in blood pressure. Backing up also has other benefits. When
you copy your data at specific times and save it permanently,
you have an accounting audit trail. Also, copying backups to
tape (or another high-capacity medium) provides a fast, convenient
way to move large amounts of data between computers. A single
6 gigabyte tape sent via overnight mail transfers data as quickly
as a 1 million-baud data link, and is probably more reliable.

Mind your media

As a mom, you may have taught your kids to make backups, but
when it comes to picking a backup medium, you're on your own.
To decide which is best for you, remember your four Cs: compatibility,
cost, convenience and capacity. For most of us, there's no
single right medium, because our backup decisions usually involve
a set of subjective trade-offs that vary from one situation
to another.

Diskettes are no longer the medium of choice. Compared to other
media, they're slow and expensive. Their only remaining advantage
is the near-universal availability of drives that can read
and write them.

Companies like Iomega and SyQuest Technology offer several types
of high-capacity, removable disks that are cheaper and faster
than diskettes, but slower and more expensive than tape. Magneto
optical disks are now entering their second generation. The
first round of products were mostly 128MB or less, but now
256MB and larger disks and drives are appearing.

Removable disks have one big advantage: Most programs can read
data directly from a removable disk.

Once far too expensive, hard disks are now surprisingly affordable.
Plummeting prices have made backup hard disks reasonable choices.
Backing up to a second hard disk has drawbacks, though. First,
most hard disks aren't removable. This makes it tough to protect
backup hard disks from fire, theft and other hazards that threaten
the original data. In addition, hard disk controller failures
and other hardware problems may also corrupt backup, as well
as original, data.

DAT's great

Tape is currently the most convenient and affordable backup
medium. QIC (Quarter Inch Cartridge) drives and tapes are inexpensive
and store fairly large amounts of data. QIC tape drives typically
attach to your computer's diskette controller or to a parallel
port.

If you have lots of data, DAT (digital audio tape) may be your
best choice. These drives are fast, and the tapes hold a lot
of data (4GB or more) at a modest cost (1 to 2 cents per megabyte).
Almost all DAT drives are SCSI devices, so if you don't already
own a SCSI adapter, it'll add $100 to $200 to the cost of the
drive.

Finally, we come to CD-R (Compact Disc-Recordable) discs. Although
you can't write to a standard CD-ROM disc, you can write to
a CD-R disc-once. (Some CD-R devices permit multiple recording
sessions until the disc is full.) After that, you can read
from it using any standard CD-ROM drive. This option is expensive,
though. Several vendors are reportedly working on drives that
will sell for about half the price of current models, but that
still won't close the cost gap between CD-R and tape.

By the way, don't forget that convenience and capacity work
hand in hand. A backup medium with a capacity at least as large
as your biggest hard disk partition makes backing up your data
more convenient. It also makes possible entirely unattended,
timed backups.

If you're using Windows or Windows for Workgroups 3.x, you have
lots of software choices. MS-DOS versions through 6.22 include
a simple program that allows you to store data on diskettes
or other devices that behave like hard disks (such as removable
disks). The most recent versions of this software include advanced
features such as cataloging and compression, and even run under
Windows.

You have lots of third-party choices, too. Almost all tape drives
come bundled with custom backup software designed to work with
a particular drive.

If those programs don't suit you, Symantec offers Norton Backup
3.0. This supports a variety of QIC and DAT drives, as well
as diskettes and other drive-like media. Even some SCSI adapter
board driver software kits, such as Adaptec's EZ-SCSI and Corel
Systems Corel SCSI, include useful Windows-based backup software.

But if you've already made the jump to Windows 95, your backup
software choices are more limited. If you're backing up to
diskette or another disk-like device, the backup software shipping
with Windows 95 may do the job. That software also supports
several popular QIC tape drives connected via a diskette drive
controller. But Windows 95's built-in software doesn't support
SCSI or IDE tape drives. If you're using either of those devices,
you have only two choices as of this writing.

Hewlett-Packard recently released Colorado Backup for Windows
95, which supports all current Hewlett-Packard and Colorado
Memory Systems tape drives. If you're currently using Colorado
Backup software, you're eligible for a free upgrade to the
Windows 95 version through April 1st. You can download it from
HP's BBS (970-635-0650) or its ftp site (col.hp.com/dist/hp
colorado; on the BBS and ftp site, download file CBW95.exe).
The company will also ship you the upgrade for $7.95 (800-469
5150)

The third-party tape backup software on the market is Arcada's
Backup for Windows 95. This program marks the company's first
appearance in the small-network and standalone PC markets.
In addition to supporting almost all SCSI tape drives, Arcada's
Windows 95 software supports most QIC drives (connected via
a diskette controller or parallel port) and IDE tape drives.

You may be wondering why Win95 users need their own backup software.
Why not continue using your trusty DOS and Windows 3.x software?

Most older software appears to work under Windows 95. The program
will run, write data to tape or disk, even compare the data
on tape to the original data on disk, and report success. But
when the time comes to restore that data to your hard disk,
you'll discover that two pieces of vital information are missing
or corrupt.

First, older software can't see or store Win95's long filenames.
So, when you restore a file, you lose the original long filename.
Even if you personally don't use the long filename feature,
Windows 95 itself does. Many important system files and directories
bear long names that older software can't preserve.

The Windows 95 Registry poses another problem for Windows 3.x
based backup software. While Windows 95 is running, this file
is a bit exotic. As you probably know, Windows 95, and applications
developed for it, treat the Registry as a central information
depository. What you may not have heard is that some of that
information is kept in RAM, while other information is generated
on the fly in response to requests.

Programs that aren't aware of the Registry's special nature
will copy the portion of the Registry currently on disk. This
will appear to work, but will result in a file that corrupts
the real Registry when you restore it. By using special Windows
95 API calls to read and write the Registry, backup software
designed for Windows 95 is able to avoid this mistake.

Old backup utilities aren't the only programs that can't see
or preserve Windows 95's new long filenames. Pre-Windows 95
defragging, directory sorting and other low-level disk utilities
have this blind spot, too. Fortunately, the utilities that
ship with Windows 95 make most of this older software unnecessary.

However, in a few cases, the new utilities may not do the job.
The current Windows 95 backup utilities may not support your
backup device. Or you may be using a mass storage device that's
incompatible with Windows 95's standard disk utilities.

If you find yourself in one of these rare situations, take a
look at Windows 95's LFNBK.EXE. This utility allows you to
use your old software and still preserve long filename information.

Power Windows: The Best of Both Worlds -- Have your old software and 
long filenames, too.

By:
Karen Kenworthy

If you must use an old disk utility that doesn't see or preserve
Windows 95's long filenames, don't despair. LFNBK.EXE allows
those programs to run safely.

It works its magic by stripping all long filename information
from your disk. It also converts a filename's lowercase letters
into uppercase. Once that's done, the disk will look exactly
as all disks looked before Windows 95-every filename will conform
to the familiar DOS 8.3 filename convention. It's now safe
to run your old software because there's no long filename information
for it to lose.

When the old utility is finished, you'll need to restore the
original filename information. Fortunately, LFNBK.EXE tucked
away the needed information in a file (LFNBK.DAT) in the disk's
root directory before stripping it. On request, LFNBK.EXE will
put those original filenames back where it found them, making
the disk ready for Windows 95 again.

To save long filename information in order to make it safe for
a pre-Windows 95 disk utility, follow these steps:

Disable Long Name Preservation for Old Programs "Build a Tunnel
to Long Filenames")

Close all running applications (LFNBK can't process open files)

Open a Windows 95 DOS box, and enter this command: LFNBK /B
 
Restart your computer. If your old disk utility is a DOS program,
restart your computer in MS-DOS mode.

To restore long filename information, once your pre-Windows
95 disk utility has finished, follow these steps:

If necessary, restart your computer to load Windows 95.

Open a Windows 95 DOS box and enter this command: LFNBK /R
Reenable Long Name Preservation for Old Programs.

Restart your computer.

For more information about LFNBK.EXE, read the accompanying
LFNBK.TXT file. You'll find both files on the Windows 95 CD
in the \ADMIN\APPTOOLS\LFNBACK directory. To install it, copy
the LFNBK.EXE to your \WINDOWS\COMMAND directory.

If you have the diskette version of Windows 95, you'll need
to download a copy of the program. You'll find it in the WinMag
forums on America Online and CompuServe, and on the Web at
http://download.windows.microsoft.com/windows/download/lfnb.exe.

Power Windows: Build a Tunnel to Long Filenames

By:
Karen Kenworthy

Tunneling, a remarkable quantum mechanics phenomenon, occurs
when a particle passes from one quantum state to another without
possessing the energy to leave its current potential energy
well. In effect, the particle tunnels through the potential
energy barrier rather than climbing over it.

What does this have to do with Windows? Tunneling is also a
remarkable trick from Windows 95's developers. This trick allows
old DOS and Windows programs to update files with long names,
without losing the original long filename information.

When applications software updates an existing file, it usually
performs three steps:

1. It gives the old file a new, temporary name.

2. It creates a new file with the old file's original name.

3. It removes the old file, which now sports a temporary name.

If the application program understands and maintains Windows
95's long filenames, all is well. The new file it created in
step 2 will bear the same long filename as the original.

But if an application program doesn't know about Windows 95's
long filenames, something could go awry in step 2. Instead
of long filenames, older programs only see the substitute,
truncated 8.3 filename that Windows 95 assigns. When creating
the new file, the older application will specify the truncated
name instead of the longer version.

But Windows 95 is not so easily fooled. It knows how application
programs behave, and watches for the rename/create/remove sequence.
When it detects this pattern it automatically transfers the
old file's long filename to the new file.

The long filename appears to "tunnel" from one version of the
file to the next.This feature is useful most of the time. But
it can defeat the operation of LFNBK.EXE, which tries to remove
long filename information. That's one reason Windows 95 lets
you disable and reenable tunneling.

To disable tunneling, follow these steps:

1 Double-click on Control Panel's System icon.

2 When the System Properties dialog appears, select its Performance
tab, then click on the File System button.

3 When the File System Properties dialog appears, select its
Troubleshooting tab, then select the Disable Long Name Preservation
for Old Programs check box.

4 Click on OK and restart your computer when asked.

To enable tunneling, follow the same steps but in step 3, remove
the check in the box labeled Disable Long Name Preservation
for Old Programs.

Networking Windows: System Policies Keep Users in Line

By:
Eric Carr

I KNOW YOU. You think User Profiles are great for keeping novice
users out of trouble, and for preventing more experienced users
from getting in and mucking things up. But you want a more
fundamental level of control-say, at the system level.

You want System Policies. Think of System Policies as overrides
to the local machine's Registry. Stored on the server, System
Policies are downloaded into the local machine's Registry during
log-in. They overwrite the local machine's settings, enforcing
a consistent set of rules for every user who logs into the
network. Whereas User Profiles can make changes to the desktop
settings in the Registry, System Policy settings can alter
the desktop's properties (USER.DAT) as well as the log-in and
network-access properties stored in SYSTEM.DAT. In essence,
System Policies define what properties the user can set.

You create System Policies with the System Policy Editor (SPE),
a graphical tool that presents system settings in a tree format,
much like the hardware components in Control Panel's system
folder. The Editor uses a template file to display (and change,
when necessary) the contents of the Registry. (Mastering template
programming is complex enough to be a university-level course.
See the sidebar "So You Wanna Be a Systems Programmer.")

What price power?

The SPE provides some powerful facilities for controlling what
you can accomplish on a Windows 95 desktop. But this power
doesn't come cheap: You can inadvertently destroy the user's
current configuration if you're not careful about what you
change and what you leave alone. For example, if you suddenly
decide to put a bitmap on users' desktops without warning,
I guarantee you'll get feedback-and it won't all be positive.

Although some power is good to keep chaos in check, you've heard
the saying about absolute power. It's probably not a good idea
to destroy users' efforts to customize desktops unless you
have considerable management backup.

The check boxes in the Policy Editor (in Policy File mode) operate
a little differently than normal. If they're checked, the policy
will be implemented; if they're empty, the policy won't be
implemented. If they're shaded, the setting won't be changed
from the current setting, and Windows 95 won't make any changes
to the existing policy.

For instance, if you suddenly decide everyone should be using
the Microsoft Client for NetWare to connect to your NetWare
server, be sure to select the options to use the Client for
NetWare, as shown in the left-hand screenshot in the sidebar
"Make It Your Policy to Be Shady." That would ensure that everyone
was using the client. Later on during the session, when you
realize not everyone is set up to use this method of network
attachment, your first instinct may be to go back and clear
the check marks, as shown in the center screenshot.

Don't do it. When you clear the check marks, you indicate that
Client for NetWare shouldn't be used; therefore, all the users
who already employ this method of attachment will have their
configurations destroyed the next time they log in and download
the policy into their Registries. Whoops!

The correct response is to click on the boxes until they become
shaded, as shown in the right-hand screenshot. This indicates
the policy remains unchanged from the current setting (the
setting in force when you invoked the Policy Editor)

The moral of the story is: When you have to decide whether to
implement or remove a policy, tread carefully and think about
the ramifications of your actions.

You'll find many more goodies like the SPE on the CD version
of Win95. If you're serious about getting and using all the
features I discuss here, get the CD. You install the Policy
Editor via Windows 95's Add/Remove Programs applet in the Control
Panel. Run the applet, select the Windows Setup tab and click
on the Have Disk button. In the dialog box, choose Browse and
then enter the path to the \ADMIN\APPTOOLS\POLEDIT directory
on the Win95 CD. Click on OK and then on OK again. In the Have
Disk dialog box, check the System Policy Editor option. It
wouldn't hurt to install the Group Policy capability at this
point, so you may as well check that box, too. Group Policies
are applied to Windows 95 users and machines included in one
or more network groups-either NetWare or Windows NT. Later,
you can install Group Policies using these same instructions.

Restrict access

Finally, click on the Install button. Microsoft recommends you
restrict SPE installation to a small number of users. It's
powerful and could be potentially damaging if used by a lot
of people. Think carefully about who should have access to
this application.

Fire up the Policy Editor to see what's going on by running
the POLEDIT application. The editor operates on each part of
the Registry-the user portion and the computer component-but
not both simultaneously. I don't have the space here to detail
all of these settings, so I encourage you to do some exploring.
Start by selecting File/New. When the default user and computer
icons appear, double-click on either to see the categories
of policies.

You can use the Policy Editor in one of two ways. In Registry
mode, the editor operates directly on the local computer's
Registry. When you open the Registry, you'll note the editor
initially shows only the local user and the local computer.
(I'll deal with remotely connected computers in a future installment.
If you can't wait, read Chapter 16 of the Microsoft Windows
95 Resource Kit to see how to set up and manage remote control
and administration.) When you use the Policy Editor in Registry
mode, just click on the portion of the Registry you want to
set policy for-either the user or the computer. Changes you
make become effective after you restart the machine. Use this
mode with caution, because you could end up making changes
that will affect your machine.

Use the SPE to create policy files you store on the server and
download whenever a user or member of a group logs into the
network. This mode is sometimes called Policy File mode. It
doesn't directly affect the Registry-rather it creates the
file containing directives that are downloaded into the Registry
during the log-in process. I used the Policy File mode in my
earlier example. It permits you to explore the capabilities
without making changes to your Registry. Don't save the file
while you're getting used to the Policy Editor. When you're
ready, though, save it as CONFIG.POL.

Apply the changes to many users

Adding policies for specific groups is a snap. From the Edit
menu, select Add Group. To get a pick list of the available
groups, click on the Browse button and stand back. We did this
on our server in San Mateo and got a huge list of users, groups
and print queues.

You can define only those groups that have been previously defined
within the network operating system. As you might expect, Group
Policies look exactly like User Policies, because groups are
made up of multiple users. To ensure Group Policies are enforced,
install GROUPPOL.DLL on each participating computer in the
group. Do this when you first deploy Windows 95 in a custom
installation script. Or, you can go around to each computer
and do it individually, just as you installed the SPE.

To activate the new policy that you've constructed, copy the
CONFIG.POL file to the server. For Windows NT, place the file
in the NETLOGON directory; NetWare users should place the file
in the PUBLIC directory. Once again, you'll need to be running
the 32-bit client to make this work automatically, but there
are workarounds if you're running another type of client, as
with User Profiles. To configure for manual downloading of
System Policies, edit the local Registry of the machine using
the SPE, as shown in the sidebar "Switch to Manual." Make sure
you specify the complete path and filename for the manual download.

You need to install the SPE on every machine to make some of
these changes. At the very least, you'll need a disk containing
the SPE that you can carry around as you visit different desktops,
or the editor loaded in a secure area of the network that only
you can access. Although these approaches will all work, there's
a more elegant method of managing and controlling remote computers'
Registries-and that's what I'll show you next month.

Networking Windows: So You Wanna Be A Systems Programmer

By:
Eric Carr

Although the System Policies supplied with Win95 are comprehensive,
they don't address the needs that could crop up when you're
deploying a custom or in-house-developed application. For these
requirements, you may need a customized version of the System
Policy template. You can create one using a text editor. This
is not for the faint of heart, but it can be done. The text
below-from the \WINDOWS\INF\ADMIN.ADM file-shows what it takes
to create two small policies. So, dust off your books on structured
programming, bone up on object-oriented terminology and you,
too, can become a systems programmer.

Windows NT: NT's Future Looks Bright

By:
John D. Ruley

I'VE POLISHED OFF my crystal ball just in time for the New Year,
so I can bring you the first-ever State of NT report. I've
drawn from Microsoft's public statements, Deep Dark's and other
confidential sources' whisperings, and other industry information.
It's guaranteed to be as accurate as possible-meaning somewhere
between blind guesswork and gospel truth.

Let's start with 1996. First, we'll see public demos of the
next NT product, Microsoft's Shell Update Release (SUR). Microsoft
has already shown it at Networld/Interop, and I'll bet that
by now we've seen more of it at Fall Comdex. Aside from the
Windows 95-style Explorer interface, we'll see other features
in the SUR (see "The Big SUR")

Once Microsoft releases SUR, we'll see new NT/Back Office products
from the company. Among these will be the Gibraltar Internet
server, maybe Microsoft's Catapult Firewall, the much-anticipated
Exchange messaging server and a new version of Systems Management
Server (SMS) with secure remote control for NT clients. (Deep
Dark tells me this may turn up in a Service Pack to SMS 1.1).
These pieces will be integrated into the obligatory new version
of Microsoft's Back Office bundle, which should appear around
the third quarter. By that time, developers should see Cairo
related developmental betas: Network OLE, Object File System
(OFS) and Distributed File System (DFS)

Further ahead: 1997

Here's where I go out on a limb. Look at the calendar, consider
everything I've just mentioned and think about something Deep
Dark once said ("If we can't ship a new release by Comdex,
we can't ship it by the end of the year!"). I can't see Microsoft
shipping even a beta version of Cairo this year. Developers
will get an early peek, but even they won't get a full operating
system beta until January 1997. It may take that long just
to merge OFS and DFS into a single file system.

Slipping to 1997 means Cairo should have no trouble integrating
all the anticipated major features: Plug-and-Play support (which
will make possible a new spate of hot-swappable peripherals
for network servers), Kerberos networkwide security and cluster
support integrated directly into the NT kernel (jointly developed
by Microsoft and Digital). By then, the Windows 95 team will
have a new version of its OS with Network OLE support in place
to act as a Cairo client. There should be another round of
new server-side products by then, but I have no idea what they'll
be.

A look back at 1995

It's interesting to look back at what seemed important last
January. The PowerPC topped everyone's list. Even Microsoft
called NT 3.51 the PowerPC version. What impact has the PowerPC
made on NT to date? CompuServe provides an interesting answer.
Since August, users have downloaded a minuscule percentage
of files for this and other RISC platforms.

Lesson: PowerPC, and RISC platforms as a whole, represent an
insignificant percentage of NT desktops (Shell Technology Preview
is a desktop-oriented file). They represent a greater portion
of NT Servers, but they're still a minority. PowerPC has merely
split the already small RISC pie among three players instead
of two. The big loser in that split has been Mips Technologies,
which was the first RISC architecture NT supported.

This is a pity. Many people-including me-had high hopes that
NT's RISC platform support would bring some badly needed competition
into the microchip market, but it didn't happen.

Something else that didn't happen in 1995 was the expected flood
of 32-bit Windows applications for both Windows 95 and NT.
Microsoft could point to its InfoSource CD-ROM, which lists
more than 4,000 Back Office-compatible products-75 percent
of which run on NT and are presumably 32 bit. But most of those
are specialized-looking for word processors and spreadsheets
still turns up only two products each. (I'm writing this before
Fall Comdex, so there could be a surprise batch of end-of-the
year products. If that's the case, vendors are being awfully
quiet.)

WINDOWS Magazine's senior technical editor Dave Methvin found
out why while he was working on Wintune 95 (downloadable from
our areas listed on page 18 and available on the WINDOWS Magazine
CD-ROM). This test and tune-up kit is a Win32 application targeted
at Windows 95 and designed to run on NT as well. Dave found
Win32 development to be more difficult than he expected. The
current Win32 SDKs are buggy, and the documentation is incomplete.
Many incompatibilities exist between NT and Win95, and as I
write this, Microsoft is still changing guidelines for Win95
developers-a good two months after Win95 shipped. I'm hoping
these problems will be cleared up in 1996.

In other news

The NT 3.51 Resource Kit is finally about to ship and should
be available by the time you read this. I still haven't gotten
a copy. I'm expecting NT script support for both PERL (the
scripting language used by World Wide Web servers) and REXX
(popular with OS/2 folks), along with improved versions of
several popular NT utilities, which I hope include a better
DNS implementation. Multiprotocol Router might ship in the
resource kit, but I doubt it. Microsoft is also offering Service
Pack #2 for NT 3.51, which fixes yet more bugs. The company
has released to manufacturing Back Office 1.5 (NT Server 3.51,
SQL Server 6.0, MS Mail 3.5, SMS 1.1, SNA Server 2.11) and
it should be available by now. Microsoft is also offering Microsoft
Developers Network (MSDN) level III, something new for Back
Office developers. This is basically everything from levels
I and II (all SDKs and access to early Win95 and NT betas),
plus a Back Office suite developmental test version. It's also
a good tool for IT departments.

How not to 

A correspondent who prefers to remain nameless recently pointed
out something I'm not too happy about: Microsoft's Repair Disk
(RDISK) utility for NT doesn't save security information-including
user accounts-when you use it after you install NT. There's
a difference of opinion about whether this is a bug. Deep Dark
said the development group told him this behavior is by design,
but TechNet yielded a product support item (PSS ID Number:
Q126464) that reports it as a bug. Both groups agree on the
workaround: Use NT's built-in backup (NTBACKUP) app, with the
option to save/restore Registry data.

Sorry, Deep, but this time I'm with the product support folks.
It's a bug. Users who create an emergency disk on setup, and
then regularly update it using RDISK, ought to expect all their
Registry settings would be restored, including security and
user accounts. Otherwise, what good is it? With the current
setup, using the emergency disk to recover after a server fails
to boot will give you just one account:

Administrator.

Because this information differs from what I wrote in my first
NT Question and Answer file, and in my book, Networking Windows
NT 3.51, I've posted corrected files (NTQA02.ZIP and NETNT02.TXT).
You'll find both in the NT and Windows 95 section of our file
library on CompuServe (GO:WINMAG), AOL (Keyword:WinMag) or
ftp.winmag.com. These files also include answers to the most
common questions, as well as updated information since the
book went to press.

Brilliant and bogus

I recently spent a day at Arbor Software's (408-727-5800, fax
408-727-7140) annual meeting for ESSbase users. This multidimensional,
nonrelational database is aimed at On-Line Analytical Processing
(OLAP). It's expensive-an entry-level setup runs around $43,000
but it can turn trend analysis at a big company from a task
that takes weeks to one that can be completed in minutes. Users
I spoke with, including representatives from ARCO, May Co.
stores, the U.S. Navy, Intel and Microsoft, had nothing but
good things to say about the database. The only bad comment
I heard was from some IT folks who worry about end users trying
to do too much, which is what IT folks usually say. Arbor originally
wrote ESSbase for OS/2, but now supports it on UNIX and NT
platforms.

In the bogus department I hate to do this, but I can't let IBM's
Warp Server beta pass without comment. I haven't spent much
time with it myself, but our assistant technical editor Serdar
Yegulalp did, and his reaction was far from positive. In fairness,
we have to tell you that he did eventually get it installed,
but he described the experience as an "ugly bloody mess." IBM's
"Easy Start" code name seems like a bad joke.

We're also not impressed by the feature set-Warp Server seems
to be a basic bundle that includes file-and-print services
from the old LAN Server product line, Warp itself, LAN Distance
remote access, SystemView system management, a basic backup
application and a print spooler IBM pretentiously refers to
as "Advanced Print Services." Compared with NT Server, the
bundle lacks Macintosh client support and isn't nearly as well
integrated. We were hoping to see IBM bundle in some form of
Notes server, but it's not in the beta Serdar installed. Pretty
bogus, IBM!

Book of the month-and a surprise

The book of the month is A History of Knowledge by Charles Van
Doren (Ballantine Books, 1992, $12.50 softbound). This isn't
a computer-related book, but the final chapter contains some
of the most profound thinking I've ever seen about the computer's
impact on our society.

Now for the surprise. If you haven't already done so, look at
the Info File sidebars in this month's Software First Impressions.
We're reporting platform compatibility for all versions of
Windows, including NT. This is information many of you have
requested. Some of you have also asked for more specialized
high-end coverage. Later this year, you'll find a new section
in WINDOWS Magazine that's aimed at the world beyond the PC
desktop. I'll have a column there, in addition to my usual
Windows NT column. It's going to be a great 1996 for NT.

Windows NT: The Big SUR -- Here are some of the features you should see
in Microsoft's Shell Update Release and companion products.

By:
John D. Ruley

Graphics Device Interface (GDI) integrated directly into the
NT kernel. This is Dave Cutler's last shot at making NT run
in 8MB. I don't think he'll make it, but this will improve
performance, so it's worth doing anyway.

An Internet browser built directly into the SUR's shell. This
will be an NT version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser
for Win95, which is currently on beta at Microsoft's Web site
(www.microsoft.com). You may still want to keep Netscape handy,
but having a browser built right into the shell is convenient.

The long-awaited Windows 95-style Telephone API (TAPI) and associated
modem driver. We'll finally be able to use NT as a client to
the Microsoft Network. The modem driver will be either Unimodem
or a hack using NT Remote Access Services to give NT equal
capabilities.

A new Multiprotocol Router either built into NT Server or available
as an add-on. As I write this, it's in public beta on the MSNET
forum on CompuServe. It fills in one of the last places where
NetWare has a feature NT lacks. Combined with RAS, it should
significantly enhance NT Server's capability in WAN environments.
(Editor's Note: At press time, Microsoft released a version
of the Multiprotocol Router for NT Server in NT 3.51 Service
Pack #2.)

NetWare file/print emulation (FPNW) and a NetWare Directory
Service Manager (DSMN). The former is now shipping as an add
on for NT Server 3.51; the latter is in beta. Together, these
products facilitate bringing NT Server into a NetWare environment.
They enable you to use existing NetWare client software without
any modification, and administer both NT Server and NetWare
servers from a single graphical interface. Microsoft is also
experimenting with dedicated telephone support for users converting
to NT Server from NetWare (800-833-9264). The promotional price
is $75 per call.

Microsoft's new DirectX low-level game API and other Win95-specific
APIs for NT Workstation. Future Win95 versions will get more
of the NT APIs. In the short term, this means DOOM for Windows
95 should run on NT as well. In the long run, it means a new
generation of high-performance graphics in business applications
like videoconferencing and presentation graphics can be developed.

Unified administration tools in NT Server. This one's chancy.
It's based on an off-the-cuff comment from a Microsoft contact,
but NT's administration tools are due for a face-lift. I'm
hoping for something similar to the Starfighter tools introduced
in SQL Server 6.0-a single, integrated management interface
with OLE Automation support. That would allow an administrator
to use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as language to write
management scripts.We'll get this eventually, but maybe not
in the SUR.

Programming Windows: Better the Devil You Know

By:
Martin Heller

IN PARADISE LOST, Milton tells the tale of a rebellion in heaven
led by Lucifer, one of the brightest archangels. The revolt
fails, and when the rebel and his followers are cast into the
pit, he reflects:

"Here at least

We shall be free 

Better to reign in Hell,

than serve in Heav'n."

Now, you may not agree with me, but I've long thought Lucifer
got a bad rap. Think about it: How much free will does an angel
have? Could Lucifer have opposed God if it hadn't been God's
will? Didn't Lucifer's opposition cause God to kick Adam and
Eve out of that stifling Paradise and into the world where
they belonged? Wouldn't it all have been too boring for words
otherwise?

Although he's certainly the archetype, Lucifer isn't the only
case of demonization on record. Take Microsoft-and more specifically,
Bill Gates. Many imagine Bill to be Satan, reigning in hell
with his 12,000-odd minions, instead of a nerdy Harvard dropout
hacker with a strong sense of competition, an ability to see
the obvious, and a lot of good luck and perseverance. They
view Microsoft as a unified demonic hierarchy, operating with
a single malicious mind, instead of a mixed collection of fairly
bright, underpaid people all with different agendas, trying
to operate as well as they can in a state of ever-changing
goals and e-mail overload.

These same people buy Microsoft products-sometimes with justification,
sometimes without. It's as though the old adage about nobody
losing his or her job buying IBM has shifted to refer to Microsoft.
I wouldn't lose my job talking about word processors and spreadsheets,
but what I really know about are development tools. Usually,
when I ask Win32 programmers which C/C++ compiler they use
and which they want tools for, they say "Microsoft."

I'm not as sure. Readers, especially beginners, often send me
e-mail requesting advice. After "What's the best language for
a beginning programmer?" (Answer: "It depends"), the most common
question is "What's the best C++ compiler?" That answer is
also "It depends," although the parameters are slightly different.

I currently recommend four C/C++ compilers for Windows platforms,
from Microsoft, Borland, Watcom and Symantec. One salient point
is that all but Borland's come with essentially the same class
library, MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class). So if you hate MFC,
or love Borland's Object Windows Libraries (OWL), buy Borland.
If you love MFC, buy one of the other three. Typically Microsoft's
MFC version is slightly newer than Watcom's and Symantec's,
but that only matters when something you need right away is
added to the class library.

In addition, Microsoft offers the only compiler that's supported
on RISC platforms for Windows NT. That cross-platform strategy
appeals to a lot of people, and certainly convinced me for
awhile. But I no longer think it's terribly important. Except
in specialized areas such as engineering, software sales on
Intel platforms far outweigh sales on RISC platforms like Mips,
Alpha and PowerPC. Because Windows 95 is Intel-only, Intel's
dominance will most likely continue. In addition, the power
of the P6 processor will make it awfully hard for the others
to continue to compete on performance, despite all the advantages
inherent in RISC designs-small dies, low cost and so on. I'm
not saying you should ignore the market for Win32 applications
on RISC machines, but it isn't a life-or-death consideration.

From a performance standpoint, Watcom has consistently been
my pick among compilers. There are always specific things each
compiler does a little better than the others. I haven't had
a chance to do a scientific comparison, but Watcom still appears
to hold an edge on code optimizations. On the other hand, Watcom's
previous reliance on cryptic command-line interfaces has historically
produced an overall development package only a seasoned hacker
could love.

Keep it simple

That's changed in Watcom C/C++ 10.5. The company has cleaned
up its development environment a bit and added Visual Programmer,
an excellent visual development tool that generates MFC code.
Visual Programmer is a stripped-down version of WindowsMaker
Professional, licensed from Blue Sky Software. Symantec has
also shipped Visual Programmer with its compiler.

Visual programming has its pros and cons. It's flexible, and
it's productive if the user interface is the most important
part of the application. On the other hand, visual programming
can isolate you from the underlying code, and sometimes the
simpler approach is just as effective. For 90 percent of the
programs I've worked on, I've found generating the application's
user interface with Microsoft's wizards or Borland's assistants
works well and gets me to the meat of my programming in under
an hour.

In its latest compiler, Visual C++ 4.0, Microsoft has made a
number of productivity improvements that raise the bar for
its competitors. The most important involve code reuse. The
new Component Gallery is a stab at a code repository. The ability
to create and use OLE controls complements the ability to create
and use C++ classes. Resource templates let you reuse dialog
designs and other resources. The ability to create custom AppWizards
allows you to capture and distribute your own experience and
standards. Finally, for those of you who like to prototype
in VB, the VC++ dialog editor can now import Visual Basic forms
within limits.

Microsoft has addressed many of VC++'s shortcomings. The latest
version's development environment offers the option to rebuild
only files really affected by a header change. It also sports
more convenient debugging, a beefed-up editor, incremental
compilation and improved incremental linking. You no longer
need to compile to browse your code by classes and functions.
You can finally create an OLE control container as well as
an OLE control. The memory allocator-the cause of the "out
of virtual memory" problem first made public in this column
last July-has been completely rewritten.

Many enhancements have been made to MFC. For example, the classes
for OLE controls have been integrated with the rest of the
framework-there's no longer a separate OLE control development
kit. And the support for OLE controls and their containers
is built right into the CWnd class. An OLE control in a window
is treated as a special kind of child window. You can create
an OLE control dynamically using CWnd::CreateControl or statically
from a dialog template, with support in the dialog editor for
placing OLE controls in dialog templates just like any other
kind of controls.

Along the same lines, two new classes encapsulate the OLE common
dialogs for setting up printed pages and modifying the properties
of OLE objects-CPageSetupDialog and COlePropertiesDialog. Similarly,
new classes are provided for all the Windows 95 common controls
(see "A Glossary of Common Controls")

The list, tree and rich edit classes are a bit complicated to
use by themselves, so the following view classes have been
added: CListView, CTreeView and CRich- EditView. What's the
sample program for the CRichEditView class? WordPad!

The common controls aren't the only Win32 enhancements to MFC.
It finally has real support for multithreading, in the form
of synchronization object classes, to supplement the existing
thread-creation functions and classes. Synchronization object
classes provide an interesting alternative to separate synchronization
objects. You can add the synchronization objects a class needs
as data members, add the synchronization code needed to the
class member functions and have a thread-safe class ready to
drop in place without further ado. This ease of use, however,
sometimes comes at a cost to runtime speed.

Database heaven

MFC has finally gotten new classes for Data Access Objects (DAO)
in other words, classes to allow C++ programmers to use the
same Jet database engine as Visual Basic and Access. Until
now, the MFC database classes have been limited to using ODBC
drivers, and until now the ODBC drivers have been slower than
molasses in January.

The claim is that ODBC drivers are now much faster. I haven't
had a chance to test them, but there was certainly plenty of
room for improvement. The DAO classes are reputed to be faster
than ODBC classes when using MDB (Access format), dBASE, FoxPro
and Paradox databases; Excel and Lotus spreadsheets; and text
files for data. The DAO classes-and the underlying Jet engine
can also use ODBC drivers, but this generally adds overhead
and slows things down. The only advantage of using DAO is that
the Jet engine can perform heterogeneous joins, which can be
a big help when you're trying to build a table from multiple
data sources.

Building a DAO application with VC++ works much like building
an ODBC. You start with AppWizard, select DAO database support
and pick a database. AppWizard knows only about MDB files,
so if you want to use another kind of database at this point
you need to attach it to an Access database. You have the option
of selecting a snapshot, dynaset or table for your recordset.
You also have the options to detect dirty columns and bind
all columns.

Once you've generated your code you can use the dialog editor
to design a data-entry form, and ClassWizard to bind controls
on the form to fields in your recordset. You can use list boxes,
combo boxes or grid controls to add browses, and you can populate
them from appropriately filtered and sorted recordsets.

It'll take me awhile to absorb this, but at first examination
I'd say that DAO turns VC++ into a fairly serious database
development tool right out of the box, with no need for third
party libraries or drivers. I doubt Oracle is worried, but
some of the less-secure database tool vendors might well consider,
to paraphrase Milton, wheth'r th' Almighty, who hath now built
here for his envy, might yet drive us hence.

Programming Windows: A Glossary of Common Controls -- New MFC classes 
for the Windows 95 common controls.

By:
Martin Heller

Control Normal Use

CAnimateCtrl This class displays successive frames of an Audio
Video Interleaved (AVI) clip during a lengthy operation.

CHeaderCtrl This resizable button appears above a column of
text, allowing you to display more or less information in the
column.

CHotKeyCtrl Create a hotkey with this window.

CImageList Manage sets of icons or bitmaps.

CListCtrl Display a collection of items, each consisting of
an icon and a label.

CProgressCtrl This is a progress bar.

CRichEditCtrl Include embedded OLE objects, and enter and edit
text with character and paragraph formatting within this window.

CSliderCtrl This is a trackbar.

CSpinButtonCtrl Control up-down movement.

CStatusBarCtrl This status bar resembles the MFC CStatusBar
class.

CTabCtrl MFC class CPropertySheet is similar to this tab control.

CToolBarCtrl This button bar resembles the MFC CToolBar class.

CToolTipCtrl Implement a small pop-up text window that describes
the purpose of a toolbar button or other application tool.

CToolBar This class implements its own tool tips.

CTreeCtrl The Windows 95 Explorer uses this tree view.

New DAO classes:

CDaoWorkspace This class defines an open session, contains databases
and provides a mechanism for multidatabase transactions.

CDaoDatabase Here, a single database connection is represented.

CDaoTableDef This represents the schema of a database. Unlike
the ODBC classes, the MFC DAO classes let you manipulate your
database schema. You can create and delete fields and even
create and delete indexes.

CDaoRecordset Select one or more columns from rows of one or
more database tables, as well as the field values for the current
record. A recordset is often the result of a query, represented
by a CDaoQueryDef.

CDaoException Handle unexpected conditions in the database.

Game of the Month: Ready, Set, Go!

By:
Ian Etra

Sometimes the simplest ideas make the best games. It may be
just a simple card game, but Set has won seven best game awards
and recognition by Mensa. The "cards" in Set have symbols with
four features: shape, color, number and texture. The goal is
to pick sets of three cards based on a single-but subtle-rule
 Each of the four features must be the same on all three cards,
or different on each card. Think it sounds too easy? Set forces
your brain to perceive patterns in a new way, and several variations
keep you on your toes. Play solo, against the computer, with
another player via modem or with up to nine others on the same
PC. While Set may not have the glamour or visuals of the latest
CD-ROM titles, it will keep you coming back for more (and it'll
give you a better mental workout than Minesweeper)

$24.95. Set Enterprises, 800-351-7765, 602-837-3628.

Book of the Month: Inside Windows 95

By:
Lori L. Bloomer

No less than seven million copies of Windows 95 flew off the
shelves in the five weeks after the operating system's release.
Although some buyers are new to the Windows environment, others

for beginners-unless you count Inside Windows 95. Written by

tome is geared toward the intermediate-to-expert user. It offers
hints and tips that experienced users will want, while sparing
many of the intricate explanations that populate beginner-level
books. It comes with a CD-ROM of Win95-compatible software.
Boyce's book will help you quickly become the Windows pro you
were in the "old days."

1,083 pages. $40. New Riders Publishing, 800-428-5331, 317-581

Here's How: Hire a Web-Building Team

By:
Julie R. Blumenfeld

You already know how to build your own World Wide Web site (see
"Step-by-Step to a World-Class Web Site" in the July 1995 issue
of WINDOWS Magazine), but you don't want to go through the
expense of buying a server or the hassle of finding an access
provider.

Internet presence providers are the answer. Yahoo has created
a new section for them, and at press time the section already
had 2,100 entries. You can get there by going to http://www.yahoo.com
Business_and_Economy/Companies/Internet_Presence_Providers.

Presence providers give you everything you need to get your
Web site up and running, and they come in all shapes and sizes.
Some work as consultants to help you build and market your
site; others offer inexpensive server space rental and Web
development; and some even furnish all of the above.

With Yahoo's new list, you can browse the providers' sites to
find the one that best suits your needs. Most offer examples
of the pages and services with which they're affiliated. You
can also

e-mail the affiliated sites' Webmasters to see if they're satisfied
with the provider. It's a great way to keep from getting tangled
up in the Web.
