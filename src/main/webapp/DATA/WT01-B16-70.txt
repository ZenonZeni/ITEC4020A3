<P>
Uranium makes up 4 parts per million of the earth's crust and is found in a wide range of geological and climatic environments and in many minerals, often associated with a variety of other metals.  Each deposit has a unique mix of geographic, chemical and radioactive features which must be taken into account in the design, operation and shutdown of mining operations, and which will determine the waste management strategies adopted. 
<P>
Some uranium is produced by <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/orebrief.html#insitu">in situ leach mining</A>.  In this, liquid is pumped down for the uranium to dissolve in, then pumped up again and through a column of ion exchange resin beads to extract the uranium, and then reused.  A small percentage more liquid is pumped up than down, so a little of the groundwater is drawn in to the mining zone, and the chemicals pumped down are confined to the mining zone.  This method produces a very small volume of liquid waste, but is only possible in certain geologic formations. 
<P>
However, most mining is <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/orebrief.html#surface">surface</A> or <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/orebrief.html#under">underground</A> removal of ore.  The crude uranium ore is fed into a series of crushing mills and the uranium is extracted using an acid or alkali leach process.  The wastes are composed of excavated rock with too low a uranium content for economic extraction (mine wastes), and material from the uranium extraction process (mill tailings). Tailings contain particles ranging in size from coarse, sandy material to very fine dusts.  They are normally handled as a slurry with water containing 25 to 40 per cent solids and residual processing chemicals. 
<P>
Most uranium ores contain between 0.05 and 0.2 per cent uranium, although some high grade ores may contain 15 per cent uranium or more, so the recovery of one kilogram of uranium could produce as much as two tonnes of tailings.  Except for the added processing chemicals, the tailings are inherently less hazardous than the parent ore.  However, the process of grinding and chemical treatment facilitates leaching from the ore, so that it is more likely to release soluble materials into the environment.  Waste management measures must control materials which pose radioactive or non-radioactive hazards. 
<P>
The precise chemical composition of the tailings will depend on the mineralogy of the orebody.  The radioactivity of the tailings is proportional to the ore grade.  About 15 per cent of the total radioactivity contained in the ore is accounted for in the product from the uranium mill, the other 85 per cent, consisting of uranium decay products,is discharged with the tailings. 
<P>
The principal radioactive materials present are thorium-230, radium-226, lead-210 and other radon daughters (that is, products of the decay of radon).  Thorium has a long half-life of 80 000 years, but, like lead whose half-life is only 22.3 years, is precipitated into a solid and remains inert in the tailings basin.  Although the dissolved radium is reduced by this precipitation, the mill effluent if not treated may still contain concentrations which are unacceptable for release to the environment.  Radium-226 is also a long-lived radioactive element, having a half-life of 1622 years.  It therefore requires long term control.  Radon-222 is produced from the decay of radium.  It is a short lived, inert gas, with a half life of 3.8 days.  It decays to solid radioactive polonium, bismuth and lead, which may become associated with airborne dust particles and hazardous if inhaled.  Its release into the atmosphere, when higher than acceptable, must therefore be controlled by covering or otherwise stabilising the tailings. 
<P>
Most tailings are not highly radioactive and would normally be classified as low-level waste, although some from high grade ores may reach intermediate-level activity.  The risk from direct radiation exposure from tailings is small, especially if access to the management areas is restricted. 
<P>
The non-radioactive contaminants in the tailings are similar to those from other base metal mining operations.  These materials may affect the biosphere, and so need careful handling to control their release.  They may also be accumulated in the tissues of lower plant and animal organisms, and so enter the food chain and endanger birds and mammals and, possibly, humans. 
<P>
In the early years of the uranium mining industry, measures for tailings disposal, following generally accepted mining industry practices, mainly considered location, economics, size and containment.  During the 1970s and 1980s increasingly stringent regulations have been introduced to control the release of radioactive materials into the environment.  In addition, the industry itself has begun to develop practices which ensure high quality containment with minimal environmental impact, and there is a growing effort to improve measures for long term containment.  Studies have shown that uranium mining is no more harmful to the environment than other base metal mining, which may be less stringently regulated. 
<P>
Methods for conditioning tailings to reduce harmful effects on the environment are directed towards recycling of the waste waters, precipitation and removal of radium from solution, and neutralisation to precipitate heavy metals.  The slurry is usually transported to an impoundment basin where the solid particles settle out, and the effluent is treated for removal of contaminants before discharge into a settling pond.  Treatment ponds may contain low permeability liners where appropriate to control seepage.  Barium chloride may be added to the tailings to precipitate dissolved radium-226 as radium-barium sulphate. Lime and limestone may be added to the tailings to raise the pH. Research is continuing in the industry into methods for further removing the contaminants during the mill process. 
<P>
Long term management practice must take account of the climate and geography of the surrounding region and the potential for earthquakes or flooding.  In the wet, temperate climate of the Elliot Lake mine in Canada, large volumes of effluent may be discharged, especially during the spring runoff. In contrast, in the hot, desert conditions of Namibia and also in some central US mines, wind borne dust is the major waste management problem. 
<P>
Several management options are currently practised: surface storage, shallow or deeper burial, and underwater disposal.  Surface storage is usually at the place where the tailings are deposited.  It necessitates covering and stabilising the tailings.  In shallow burial, the tailings are stored in a natural or constructed depression and covered with up to three metres of earth fill to reduce erosion and restrict radon release.  Using tailings for mine backfill or placing them in the pit of a surface mining facility is deep burial.  This is particularly appropriate for tailings from high grade ores. Finally, tailings may be disposed of under deep enough water to suppress sulphide oxidation and radon release into the atmosphere, for example at the bottom of lakes. 
<P>
Where uranium is mined as a by-product of other mining, the processes are essentially the same, but the ore is usually lower grade, so the intrinsic problems from the uranium are rather less. 
<P>
Decommissioning and reclamation of uranium mines is increasingly becoming the subject of detailed planning.  In the past, a mine might be closed with no special remedial measures to ensure that the remaining materials and infrastructure posed no hazard to the general population or to the environment.  Now, plans for eventual reclamation are an integral part of the mine development process.  In addition to generally accepted engineering practices, including demolishing buildings and sealing mine shafts, measures are taken to stabilise the tailings surface and to control seepage, so controlling radium and radon releases to the environment.
