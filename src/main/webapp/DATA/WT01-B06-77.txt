The Differences Among Mutual Fund Rankings </H2><P>
<HR>

Determining a mutual fund's return is not a complicated mathematical task. What, then, accounts for differences among returns from the various mutual fund rankings services? There are a number of factors. They include:<p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The time period covered: </strong>While the time period covered may seem a simple determination--after all, a year is a year--many mutual fund ranking sources do not match up because of different publication schedules.<p>


The calendar year--January 1 through December 31--is the most common unit of time, and multiples and fractions of the calendar year are often reported. Performance as of June 30 is also a time period used by publications going to press in late summer and early fall with a special mutual fund issue.<p>


What happens when performance covering a calendar year is compared to performance as of June 30? The performance difference between these two time periods is not just six months; in fact, there are two six-month periods that are different. A mutual fund could have drastically different performance figures over a five-year period if one figure encompasses a crash or rally that the other figure doesn't include. When you encounter different reported results on a fund you are following, look first at the precise time period covered.<p>


Another time period problem arises when ranking services provide returns for up market (bull) and down market (bear) performance periods. First, there is no precise definition of a bull or bear market. Second, some reporting services use multiple up and down market periods; and third, not all funds were in operation during all the up and down market periods. Since there is little consensus but much emphasis on this type of evaluation, for risk as well as return, ranking differences are commonplace.<p>


<li><strong>What the return includes: </strong>Returns are composed of capital gains plus income, and reflect the expenses of running the fund, along with the brokerage costs incurred in buying and selling the securities in the fund portfolio. Fund expenses include investment adviser fees and the administrative costs of the fund. If a fund has an investor-paid 12b-1 charge, which is an annual load levied on fund assets, this is also included in the return figure. Front-end loads, back-end loads and redemption fees are usually not included in the reported return  figures.<p>


However, some publications--Money magazine, for example--include full front-end loads in at least some of their performance statistics. Money reports what $10,000 would have grown to over five years, with any front-end sales charges included. The dilemma is that if front-end loads are included in all returns, short-term performance figures would be severely distorted, obscuring the performance of the fund and the portfolio manager. But loads do directly reduce the return to investors no matter what the time period.<p>


<li><strong>Reinvestment of fund distributions: </strong>Almost all reported returns include the reinvestment of any distributions made by the fund during the period. But when the distributions are reinvested does differ among reporting services, and this may make a significant difference in reported performance. Forbes, for example, reinvests distributions at the end of the month in which the fund makes its distribution (goes ex-distribution). Almost all funds reinvest, however, at the ex-distribution price on the ex-distribution day, which may not be the end of the month. If the fund price at which distributions are reinvested for mutual fund shareholders is not the same price as the month-end price, then reported returns can vary substantially, particularly when markets move sharply and abruptly.<p>


<li><strong>How the return performance is reported:</strong>There are three common reporting techniques for returns that you are most likely to encounter: dollar returns, annualized returns, and unannualized returns. While they are all correct, they will appear to be radically different. Table 3 is a sample of sources of mutual fund return data--all but one published in January and February of 1993--to illustrate a cross section of return reporting techniques, and one source reporting in September of 1992 to illustrate the impact of a difference of six months in the data. The Acorn Fund is used in the example simply because it is near the top of most alphabetical listings. Acorn is a no-load fund that is currently closed to new investors.<p>


The performance reported by Barron's is in the form of dollar changes in value and is reported on a calendar-year basis. While these dollar returns are correct, they are difficult to evaluate: Few investors can look at a dollar return, particularly over a long period, and make an informed judgment. The standard in reporting performance, and for good reason, is a percentage return.<p>


The performance figures for Money magazine differ significantly. One reason is that the data is as of December 24, 1992, and not year-end, presumably to meet publication deadlines. As you can see, the one-year return figure is most affected and the three-year and five-year returns less so. The five-year annualized return is reported at 18.4%, which makes the $19,775 figure (the value of $10,000 invested five years ago) puzzling, since compounding $10,000 at 18.4% a year should be $23,268. Money does reduce the figure by any front-end loads, but since Acorn does not have a load, no adjustment should have been made.<p>


U.S. News & World Report gives unannualized performance figures for one, three and five years, and also a dollar performance figure for five years, but with an initial investment base of $1,000. The one-year performance of 24.5% differs from the return of 24.2% reported by all the sources using year-end data; it is too large for a rounding difference but may be attributable to when distributions are assumed to be reinvested. When annualized, the 135.7% five-year return converts to 18.7% annually, a figure inconsequentially different from the other sources over the same time period. <p>


Just as dollar performance figures are harder to judge than percentage returns, unannualized multiyear returns are harder for investors to evaluate than annualized returns.<p>


When you notice discrepancies in the returns of various reporting services, check for the following factors:<p>

<ul>
<li>Be certain of the time period and only compare performance of mutual funds over identical periods.<p>


<li>Determine what loads are incorporated into the performance figures.<p>


<li>Find out when distributions are reinvested.<p>


<li>Be able to translate and understand dollar performance figures and unannualized returns if you intend to rely on them.<p>
</ul>
