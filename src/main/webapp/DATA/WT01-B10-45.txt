Dear Dr. Perloe:<p>
As you noted, the article we sent does indicate that progesterone is
absorbed better rectally versus vaginally.  Our own practical experience
confirms this, since we have seen patients improve when they switch from
vaginal to rectal use. In addition, most of the physicians we work with
specify rectal use, and in those cases where it is not specified, we always
recommend rectal use.<p>

In terms of the diarrhea, that is typically related to the suppository base
material that is chosen by the pharmacy doing the compounding.  Most
pharmacies are forced to use a PEG (polyethylene glycol) base, because it
melts at a slightly higher temperature.  Since most pharmacies do not have
 the capability to seal the suppositories in a leakproof plastic shell, the
 higher melting point gives them a bit more leeway in dispensing the
 suppositories in warm weather.  However, the PEG base is much, much harsher,
 and almost universally causes diarrhea, gas, cramping, bloating etc.  The
 other base that is available is called a fatty acid base (FA), and although
 it melts at a lower temperature, it is much less problematic for the
 patient.  It is a specially fractionated fatty acid derivative, and does not
 cause any of the reactions that are typical for the PEG base.  However,
 unless one has the capability to make and seal the finished suppository in a
 plastic shell, you cannot compound with the FA base, since it melts easily
 in warm weather.  We use only the FA base unless the physician specifically
 requests a PEG base, and this has eliminated the diarrhea problems for
 almost all of our patients who use suppositories.  In addition, the use of a
 sealed plastic shell is cleaner and more hygienic, since the suppository
 itself is never handled by the pharmacist, and it remains sealed until the
 patient opens the shell at the time of use.<p>
 
 Regardless of where your patients get their suppositories, you might want to
 consider specifying a fatty acid base on the prescription itself in order to
 minimize problems from rectal suppository use.  If your patients typically
 get their suppositories from a single local pharmacy, you might want to
 check with the pharmacist there and verify what base they are using.  If you
 would like us to work with your patients, you can be assured that we only
 use the fatty acid base (unless directed otherwise), and that we form and
 seal our suppositories in individual, sealed, plastic shells.<p>
  If you need anything else, just let me know.<p
