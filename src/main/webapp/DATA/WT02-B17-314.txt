<P><H3>Plan Your Timetable</H3>
<P>Planning a day, week, or month with perhaps, as many as 10 different events takes some doing. But if you anticipate the work that must be done, work out a timetable and follow the useful tips in this section, you will be able to get the job done without last minute panic.

<P>1. Allow plenty of time to:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Track down the right people who can help you (both volunteers and sponsors.
<LI>Find the right location for events. 
<LI>Write, print and distribute publications.  
<LI>Spread the word and build an audience.  
<LI>Contact the news media.  
<LI>Meet with the planning committee
</UL>

<P>2. Remember that it takes proportionately longer to plan depending on the number of events you organize.
<P>3. Use a timeline chart to plan what must be done each week leading up to the major events.
<P>4. Have a round-up meeting. Several weeks before the date of the event, meet with everyone involved to go over all details and arrangements. This will ensure that everyone knows the plan, plus it allows time to organize that last minute bright idea.
<P>5. Allow for an 11th hour panic period. Set a date three working days before your first event by which everything must be ready. If it isn’t, you still have breathing space to sort things out.

<P>You need meetings to make decisions and you need people to carry out those decisions. Here are some points to consider:
<P><STRONG>Number of Meetings</STRONG>
<P>You’ll probably need one or two meetings at the beginning of your planning phase to discuss ideas and agree on the purpose and scope of your program. This should include the key people and major organizations to be involved. Detailed planning meetings will be needed with smaller groups of people.
<P>As plans progress, you will need fewer meetings and more action. But don’t forget to hold the round-up meeting several weeks before the first event.
<P><STRONG>Effective Meetings</STRONG>
<P>Make sure that decisions are reached and recorded. Don’t be afraid to delegate and be sure that people know their responsibilities.
<P>Write and circulate action points as soon after the meetings as you can manage.
<P>Circulate contact list with names, addresses and telephone (and/or fax) numbers of everyone actively involved, as soon as possible. Don’t forget to circulate additions to it as the planning progresses. Actively solicit additions to this list.

<P><STRONG>Between Meetings.</STRONG>
<P>For each job that needs to be done, it helps to have a leader who is diplomatic and who can prepare the agenda and keep an overall check on everything. It helps if this person is available during the daytime and can travel around easily.
<P>You’ll probably need to visit people whose help you will require to explain and personally discuss your plans. Confirm any arrangements you make with them in writing.
<P>Confirm bookings for rooms and speakers in writing after you have reached verbal agreement.
<P>You may have to contact the same organization about different events. It helps if there is just one contact person at each end, even if these two are not directly responsible for all of it. It is very easy for misunderstandings to arise or opportunities for useful cooperation to be overlooked if two different people from the same organization are involved and don’t know the full picture.
<P>If you get agreement from someone at the top of an organization for its participation, make sure that you are also in touch with the people who will actually implement that decision.
<P><STRONG>Sharing the Workload.</STRONG>
<P>Define specific jobs and give one or two people joint responsibilities to:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Contact group members and arrange a volunteers’ schedule. 
<LI>Edit a special brochure for members about the events. 
<LI>Act as liaison with other organizations. 
<LI>Prepare the copy for a special information leaflet or supplement. 
<LI>Design questions for contests. 
<LI>Reserve rooms and speakers. 
<LI>Order displays and leaflets. 
<LI>Get entries about the events in all free local publications and the media. 
<LI>Promote attendance for events by visits to public meetings and regular meetings of other civic groups (such as veterans’ organizations, senior citizens or women’s clubs). You may find not only future participants, but potential volunteers and/or sponsors.

<P><STRONG>Team Captain</STRONG>
<P>Remember you will need bodies to do things on the days of the events (help manage meetings, move furniture, take messages, make coffee, keep leaflet supplies handy). Someone on the planning committee should have the job of getting this team together, making out a schedule and briefing volunteers. This is a good way to share the workload between more people than just the planning committee, who may be feeling fairly exhausted by the start of the event.
<P><STRONG>Building an audience</STRONG>
<P>Encourage the members of your own organization not as involved and members of other organizations to come to any meetings to be held during Energy Awareness Month. You may need separate and special publicity about this. Allow time to prepare this and distribute it. It may even be worth phoning around to encourage people to come or arrange rides for them if they would like to come but find it difficult to get to the meetings.
