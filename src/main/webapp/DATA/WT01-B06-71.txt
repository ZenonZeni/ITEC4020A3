Up Funds That Invest in Real Estate </H2><P>
<HR>

Asset allocation means finding an appropriate mix of investments among the major asset categories. Usually, the major asset categories are defined to be stocks, bonds, and cash. Real estate is often ignored in the equation.<p>


That's likely to change, however, because it's now easier than ever to include that asset class in your investment mix, considering the tremendous growth in the real estate investment trust (or "REIT") sector of the equity markets over the past several years, and the growth of mutual funds that invest in them.<p>


Lipper Analytical Services now tracks 24 real estate funds with total net assets of over $1.5 billion. That compares with just five of these specialized funds with assets of $118 million at the end of 1990. More recently, the majority of real estate mutual funds have moved most of their assets into REITs, which offer a pure play on real estate.<p>


The no-load mutual-fund route is an ideal way to include a small slice of real estate in your investment pie and--among other things--allows you to hold that asset category within an IRA or other sheltered retirement account. REITs have performed comparably to stocks in general over the past two decades and can offer significantly higher income than an S&P 500 portfolio.<p>

<br>
<H3>Why Real Estate?</H3>


Real estate is a major asset category that is often ignored because, at least until recently, it has been difficult for individual investors to enter in a practical and useful fashion.<p>


However, because of a fundamental shift in the way commercial real estate is being financed, there's now a stronger case than ever for diversifying a portfolio with real estate securities. The major change has been the growth of the real estate investment trust. Although REITs have been around since the early 1960s, they began to play a greatly expanded role in the 1990s as the industry's predominate vehicle for raising capital.<p>

<br>
<H3>REIT Background</H3>


To understand how real estate funds work, you need to understand a little bit about REITs. Here is a brief summary of some basic points to keep in mind when examining mutual funds that invest in REITs:<p>

<UL>
<LI>A REIT is similar to a closed-end fund and over 80% of all trusts trade on an exchange or on Nasdaq. These vehicles pool investors' money, using professional managers to supervise a portfolio of properties, mortgages or both, depending on the objective.<p>


<li> On average, REITs are getting larger in size, but they still remain fairly small, with the average market capitalization of the industry weighing in at about $200 million, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), the industry's Washington-based trade group. The 20 largest REITs have market capitalizations ranging from about $500 million to $1.2 billion.<p>


<li> The majority of the industry's growth has occurred in the equity-REIT category. These REITs invest directly in real property; they receive rental income and lease payments, and occasionally realize capital gains from selling properties. REIT shares have growth as well as income characteristics because their dividends grow and the values of properties tend to increase with inflation. Conversely, mortgage REITs make loans to real estate owners and collect interest payments; these trusts are sensitive to the credit quality of the borrower. Hybrid trusts hold both property and mortgages.<p>


<li> REITs have experienced considerable popularity in the last few years and there have been many IPOs as well as secondary or follow-on equity offerings. The primary reason for the unprecedented number of IPOs and the increasing size of existing REITs is that they are now playing a major role in the financing of real estate. This fact, in turn, has stimulated the introduction of the new real estate mutual funds.<p>


<li> REITs characteristically have high dividend yields, which recently have been about the same as yields on 10-year Treasury notes. The high yields make REITs interest-rate sensitive like utility stocks and other financial companies, since high-yielding equity investments compete with fixed-income securities for investor money.<p>


<li> REITs have performed roughly in line with stocks over the long term, and in fact, equity REITs outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 20 years.<p>
</ul>
<br>
<H3>Real Estate Mutual Funds </H3>


Real estate mutual funds normally have diversified holdings in many states and a few of them even take a global slant. The typical real estate fund gives representation to all major property types by targeting real estate equities, primarily REITs. Other investments include related companies such as home builders and building supply manufacturers. In addition, they may hold the stocks of companies in other industries with substantial real estate holdings. By investing in publicly traded stocks rather than properties directly, real estate portfolios offer investors the liquidity characteristic of funds.<p>


Table 1 lists the no-load real estate funds, along with selected data on each. These funds are usually much more income-oriented than the typical sector portfolio, as indicated by the relatively high income ratios on the CGM, Cohen & Steers, Columbia, Fidelity and PRA funds.<p>

Not all real estate funds have such high income ratios, however. Evergreen Global Real Estate has only a 0.74% ratio because the types of foreign real estate stocks it invests in are not high yielding. This fund has had a relatively low percentage of its assets invested in REITs--it is much more a play in foreign markets. Some other real estate funds, such as Evergreen U.S. Real Estate, may also rank long-term capital growth ahead of current income.<p>


As mentioned earlier, REITs are small stocks. The median market capitalization of a real estate fund's holdings is a good indicator of the size of companies it targets. These numbers range from about $220 million to slightly more than $500 million. The median market capitalization of the average real estate fund in Table 1 is under 2.5% of the $13.7 billion median market capitalization of the big-cap-dominated Vanguard Index Trust 500 portfolio.<p>


Fidelity Real Estate Investment, the largest and oldest of the group, had more than 89% of its assets in REITs at the end of January, 1995. The biggest categories represented were shopping centers, apartments, malls, and industrial buildings. The fund is managed by Barry Greenfield, who has been at the helm since its November 1986 inception. From that time to year end 1994, the fund produced an 8.96% annualized total return compared with an 8.26% annual return on the NAREIT Equity REIT index over that same period.<p>


Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, another large portfolio, recently had nearly 94% of its assets in REITs, including large stakes in shopping centers, apartments, and office and industrial buildings. Martin Cohen and Robert Steers, who co-manage the fund, also oversee two closed-end real estate funds.<p>


The relatively new CGM Realty is run by Kenneth Heebner, the well-known Boston-based fund manager. Heebner, who is enthusiastic about the potential for real estate securities, started the fund in May of 1994. The major sectors in its portfolio at year end 1994 were apartments, hotels, office and industrial buildings, and self storage. CGM Mutual, a $1 billion balanced fund also managed by Heebner had a 25% stake in REITs at the end of last year.<p>


Table 2 provides annual and five-year annualized total returns on a group of no-load real estate funds, compared with Lipper's general equity fund average and the NAREIT equity index. REITs and the average real estate fund fared well in 1991, 1992, and 1993, although the average fund did badly in 1990 when the REIT bear market bottomed out late that year, on the heels of one of the worst real estate slides in U.S. history. Lipper's general equity funds were down only 5.7% in 1990 in contrast to the 15.35% decline in the NAREIT equity index and even steeper declines in three of the four funds in existence at that time.<p>

Global real estate funds such as Evergreen Global Real Estate are quite different from the portfolios with a domestic orientation, and it is not appropriate to compare the performances of the former with the latter. Note the sharp contrast between the fund's 51.42% gain in 1993 and its 14.05% loss in 1994. The fund's poor performance in 1994 was due in part to negative investor sentiment on foreign markets resulting from factors such as the Mexican peso crisis. Non-U.S. real estate securities provide dramatically different investment characteristics than their domestic counterparts.<p>


Management makes a great deal of difference with a real estate fund--there is more opportunity to add value here than in other areas of the market because REITs are relatively small, inefficiently priced companies. Excluding Evergreen Global Real Estate, look at the strikingly wide variations in returns of the five remaining funds in 1994. The performances ranged from a sizable 11.63% decline to a healthy 8.31% rise in a year when the NAREIT index returned 3.17%. Also observe the sizable variations in five-year annualized returns for the funds that had data available over the full 1990-1994 period. Again, excluding Evergreen Global Real Estate, you can see that the numbers range from 2.92% for United Services Real Estate to 11.76% for Fidelity Real Estate Investment. The latter outperformed both the NAREIT index and the general equity funds average over the five-year period.<p>

<H3>Real Estate Funds versus REITS </H3>


Individuals who want exposure to real estate could, of course, invest directly in an assortment of REITs. What are the pros and cons of funds versus individual REITs?<p>


Advantages of direct investment: The primary advantage of investing directly in REITs is that you can stay less diversified and focus in on a geographic area that you think is going to be expanding. Or you could place your bet on the property type you expect to do best.<p>


Another advantage is that you bypass the expenses of a mutual fund.<p>


Disadvantages of direct investment: The disadvantages outnumber the advantages by a wide margin. For starters, REITs are highly specialized and relatively complex. It's a lot harder for most investors to pick a handful of good REITs than it is to add a few blue-chip stocks to their portfolios. Just as the management of a real estate fund is very important, it is also crucial to evaluate the managements of the REITs themselves. It takes an experienced individual with good industry contacts to judge the capabilities of REIT managers. In general, fund managers have better access to information on REITs and they are able to get it more quickly than the average individual.<p>


Real estate funds also have an advantage in terms of investing in REIT IPOs. Fund managers get the first look at the choicest REIT IPOs, before individuals have a chance to buy. The reason for this is that funds buy their shares in considerably larger quantities.<p>


In addition, it's important to have broad exposure to different property types in different geographic areas, because equity REITs can be adversely affected by a deterioration in their property values. Since REITs tend to concentrate in specific areas of the country and specialize in different types of properties, you would probably need to hold several of them to get sufficient diversification.<p>


Besides offering broad diversification, REIT fund managers have the ability to shift their investment strategies among property types and geographic areas with changing economic conditions. In recent years, for example, the demand for apartments has exceeded the demand for offices. <p>


Investing in REITs involves risks similar to those associated with investing in small stocks. REITs may have limited financial resources and their shares are less liquid than those of larger companies. Small companies, including REITs, tend to be more volatile than the larger companies included in the S&P 500. For these reasons, the diversification and professional management offered by real estate funds makes sense for the average investor.<p>


Finally, no-load real estate funds can purchase REITS at institutional brokerage rates, giving them a transaction cost advantage over the direct purchase of REITs, which you buy through a broker like any other stock.<p>

<br>
<H3>Questions to Ponder </H3>


Here are six questions to ponder if you're shopping for a real estate fund.<p>

<ul>
<li> Is the fund primarily a domestic real estate portfolio or does it invest globally? Global funds have very different characteristics and their performances can deviate significantly from those of domestic funds.<p>


<li> What is the manager's track record? Since many real estate funds have not been in existence that long, it can be difficult to judge performance. The track record of the manager in the real estate securities area is particularly important if you're considering a new fund. We've seen that some real estate funds have performed poorly over the past five years, so the possibility of disappointing performance over extended periods certainly exists.<p>


<li> How large is the fund's family and what is its reputation? Large fund groups are going to have more clout when it comes to getting the choicest REITs through the underwriters as they go public.<p>


<li>How does the income ratio of the fund relate to those of its peers? Examine this number for each available year. If the value of this ratio is relatively low find out why. It could be that the fund has high expenses or that it doesn't invest that much in REITs.<p>


<li> What percentage of the fund's total portfolio is in REITs? Funds that invest in REITs are typically more income-oriented and are generally the best choices for those looking for a pure real estate play.<p>


<li> How widely diversified is the fund both geographically and by sector? Managers that make big sector bets can do very well if the bets turn out to be right but face the obvious risk of being wrong.<p>
</ul>
<br>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>


Owning a home and even a rental property or two is not the same as holding stakes in different property types and geographic markets. To add further diversification to your asset mix, consider allocating 5% to 10% of your portfolio to a diversified real estate mutual fund.<p>


Real estate mutual funds with relatively high income ratios and proven managements offer an excellent way to round out an IRA or other tax-sheltered retirement account. But don't allocate any more than a modest slice of your investment pie to this highly specialized sector.<p>
