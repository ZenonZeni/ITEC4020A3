<h1>THE MARIHUANA TAX ACT OF 1937</h1>

<p><b>Full Text of the Marihuana Tax Act as passed in 1937</b> </p>

<p>Introduction (in italics) by David Solomon<br>
</p>

<p><em>The popular and therapeutic uses of hemp preparations are
not categorically prohibited by the provisions of the Marihuana
Tax Act of 1937. The apparent purpose of the Act is to levy a
token tax of approximately one dollar on all buyers, sellers,
importers, growers, physicians, veterinarians, and any other
persons who deal in marijuana commercially, prescribe it
professionally, or possess it. </em></p>

<p><em>The deceptive nature of that apparent purpose begins to
come into focus when the reader reaches the penalty provisions of
the Act: five years' imprisonment, a $2,000 fine, or both seem
rather excessive for evading a sum (provided for by the purchase
of a Treasury Department tax stamp) that, even if collected,
would produce only a minute amount of government revenue. (Fines
and jail sentences were f urther increased to the point of the
cruel and unusual in subsequent federal drug legislation that
incorporated the Marijuana Tax Act. It is now possible under the
later version of the Act to draw a life sentence for selling just
one marihuana cigarette to a minor.) One might wonder, too, why a
small clause, amounting to an open-ended catchall provision, was
inserted into the Act, authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury
to grant the Commissioner (then Harry Anslinger) and agents of
the Treasury Department's Bureau of Narcotics absolute
administrative regulatory, and police powers in the enforcement
of the law. The message becomes entirely clear when, having
finished the short text of the Act itself, one proceeds to the
sixty-odd pages of administrative and enforcement procedures
established by the infamous Regulations No. 1. That regulation,
not fully reproduced here, calls for a maze of affidavits,
depositions, sworn statements, and constant Treasury Department
police inspection in every instance that marijuana is bought,
sold, used, raised, distributed, given away, and so on.
Physicians who wish to purchase the one-dollar tax stamp so that
they might prescribe it for their patients are forced to report
such use to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in sworn and attested
detail, revealing the name and address of the patient, the nature
of his ailment, the dates and amounts prescribed, and so on. If a
physician for any reason fails to do so immediately, both he and
his patient are liable to imprisonment-and a heavy fine.
Obviously, the details of that regulation make it far too risky
for anyone to have anything to do with marijuana in any way
whatsoever. </em></p>

<p><em>Regulations No. 1 was more than an invasion of the
traditional right of privacy between patient and physician; it
was a hopelessly involved set of rules that were obviously
designed not merely to discourage but to prohibit the medical and
popular use of marijuana. In addition to the Marihuana Tax Act
and Regulations No. 1, the Bureau of Narcotics prepared a
standard bill for marihuana that more than forty state
legislatures enacted. This bill made possession and use of
marihuana illegal per se, and so reinforced the federal act. <br>

</p>

<p>REGULATIONS <br>
</p>

<p>Introductory <br>
</p>

<p>The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, imposes special (occupational)
taxes upon persons engaging in activities involving articles or
material within the definition of &quot;marihuana&quot; contained
in the act, and also taxes the transfer of such articles or
material. </p>

<p>These regulations deal with details as to tax computation,
procedure, the forms of records and returns, and similar matters.
These matters in some degree are controlled by certain sections
of the United States Revised Statutes and other statutes of
general application. Provisions of these statutes, as well as of
the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 are quoted, in whole or in part, as
the immediate or general basis for the regulatory provisions set
forth. The quoted provisions are from the Marihuana Tax Act of
1937 unless otherwise indicated. </p>

<p>Provisions of the statutes upon which the various articles of
the regulations are based generally have not been repeated in the
articles. Therefore, the statutory excerpts preceding the several
articles should be examined to obtain complete information. <br>
