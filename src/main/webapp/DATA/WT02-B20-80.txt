  Social skills development of preschool children with visual impairments is
discussed.  A review of the literature considers the field of child development
and social cognition, the effect of blindness on child development, and the
effects of blindness on social cognition.  Three areas concerning the
development of social skills for children with visual impairments are
addressed: social interactions and development within the home; social skills
in the preschool, with particular emphasis on play research; and early social
skills intervention programs.  It is concluded that children with visual
impairments develop differently than children without visual impairments.  Their
passage through the various stages of development is usually delayed.  The
development of socialization skills may also be delayed if the early
experiences of the child are not enhanced or mediated through the environment.
It is important to teach parents how to interact with their child, identify
their needs, and encourage interaction with siblings.  Encouraging appropriate
play skills is also important to the early acquisition of social skills.  The
child who is visually impaired must develop play skills in order to maintain
interactions with peers.  The direction for future research in preschool social
skills development is briefly considered.  (Contains 54 references).  (SW)<BR>

  This report discusses the community-based resources that may be available to
regular and special education teachers serving visually impaired students in
rural areas.  It notes the national shortage of teachers qualified to teach
children with visual impairments and suggests that rural teachers will have to
devote some effort to seeking out appropriate educational resources.
Communicating with the community can uncover resources useful in transitional
training that involves daily living skills, job training, or job placement.
Procedures for the productive use of volunteers and volunteer organizations are
considered, and local cooperatives are recommended as potential sources for
employment experience.  The report concludes that ready-made resources for
visually impaired students are unlikely to exist in rural areas and that
regular and special education teachers will need to create them.  A table
identifies local/community and regional/county organizations and personnel that
currently exist in some settings or that might be created to provide services
in the areas of employment, family support and advocacy, recreation, social and
interpersonal development, and medical or financial needs.  A second table
lists addresses and phone numbers for national organizations that focus on the
education of visually impaired and blind students.  (RAH)<BR>

  The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS),
an arm of the Library of Congress, leads a highly successful national program
to produce and distribute books and magazines for blind, visually impaired, and
physically handicapped individuals.  A fostering relationship exists between
NLS and a network of 143 regional and local libraries that serve blind and
handicapped readers directly.  By developing and disseminating centralized
policies and procedures at the national level, NLS is able to sustain a uniform
quality of service throughout the library system.  Each year NLS receives
permission to reproduce, with no royalties charged, more than 2,000 book titles
for loan.  In addition, NLS has systematically developed a collection that
provides access to some 220,000 recorded and embossed titles in 16 million
copies for a variety of blind and handicapped users.  Copyright clearance,
which is vital for a program that reproduces so many titles, and cataloging are
important features of the NLS approach: both cassette and flexible disc
recordings can be used only with special playback equipment.  NLS also has a
role in the narrative reproduction or braille embossing of materials and the
distribution of discs, cassettes, and playback equipment.  The NLS serves as a
resource for a clientele of extremely varied tastes and needs.  (SLD)<BR>

  This book, by an author with a visual impairment, is written for people with
a visual disability who wish to learn about alternate ways of processing
information, including reading, writing, organizing notes, and doing everyday
tasks.  The first chapter describes ways of adjusting to the loss of sight and
managing everyday living skills.  The second chapter deals with the use of
computers by people with visual impairments and covers the basics of computer
operations, adaptive computer input and output devices, and commonly used
application programs.  Chapter 3 discusses personal information management
systems.  Chapter 4 lists types of jobs held by people with visual disabilities
and reviews steps needed to enter or re-enter the job market.  Leisure
activities are discussed in the fifth chapter.  These activities are grouped
into three categories: those requiring physical effort, those that emphasize
mental effort, and volunteer activities.  The last chapter is on the blindness
system--organizations of and for people with visual impairments.  Benefits
provided by these and other organizations are discussed.  The text of each
chapter is followed by a list of references and resources, including books,
magazine articles, and recorded books.  Also listed are some government and
private organizations that provide services to people with visual impairments.

  Target Audience: Parents<BR>
  Intended for parents of infants and preschoolers with visual impairments,
this booklet encourages parent involvement in all aspects of educational
programming for their children and provides guidelines for selection of a
suitable program.  The first section examines the stresses involved during
transitions from one program to another.  Parents are urged to be active
members of the child's educational team by making observations, creating a
"snapshot" of the child for the team, identifying what the family thinks is
important, keeping records, planning for meetings, and dealing effectively with
professionals.  The relationship of program choice to the overall family
situation is noted.  General and specific guidelines in selecting a program are
addressed, including general atmosphere; social environment; physical
environment; learning environment; and specific features of infant programs,
preschool programs, and kindergarten programs.  Specific guidelines are also
offered to help evaluate a program from the child's point of view.  These
include looking at the learning environment, teacher competency, and transition
issues.  Also included are some suggestions for helping the child during the
first few weeks of a new program.  (DB)<BR>

  Semistructured interviews with six mothers of visually impaired children
found three dominant themes emerging: (1) emotional issues (e.g., the time of
diagnosis); (2) coping strategies (e.g., use of support networks); and (3)
problems and concerns about relationships with professionals, the child's
education, people's attitudes, and the amount of time involved in parenting.
