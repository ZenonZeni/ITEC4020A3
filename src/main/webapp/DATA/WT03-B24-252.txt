<p><strong>NEW HAVEN, Conn.</strong> - The holiday season began in earnest 
recently with the Dec. 6 arrest of a Santa-suited union 
organizer in New York, followed with the Dec. 10 arrest of 
AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney here.</p>

<p>Sweeney was arrested at a solidarity march and rally in 
support of the Federation of Union Employees at Yale 
University. He was also arrested earlier this year while 
supporting Detroit newspaper workers on strike against that 
city's daily papers.</p>

<p>'Santa,' in actuality UNITE organizer Kurt Edelman, was 
arrested while participating in a demonstration protesting 
the sale of garments produced by sweatshop labor at Lord & 
Taylor, an up-scale Manhattan clothing store.</p>

<p>"We are here to send a message from one of our nation's 
poorest communities to one of its richest institutions that 
we may be poor but we have a secret power," Sweeney told the 
more than 1,500 cheering demonstrators, "and we are going to 
use that power to keep Yale a civilized institution." Yale, 
with a $4.8 billion endowment is the largest employer in New 
Haven, a city where the per capita income is less than 
$13,000.</p>

<p>Sweeney said the battle of 3,700 technical, service and 
maintenance workers at Yale was part of a nationwide 
campaign to bring greedy employers "from New Haven to New 
Mexico" to justice.</p>

<p>Sweeney then led several hundred demonstrators into the 
street. When the group ignored a police order to disperse, 
Sweeney, together with more than 300 others, was escorted to 
waiting police vehicles as Rosa Dasher, a member of Local 
35, joined guitarist Tom Juravich in a spirited rendition of 
"You'll Never Walk Alone."</p>

<p>Even the police smiled as a voice from the crowd said, 
"Don't let them take you alive!" as the arrests began.</p>

<p>In an interview before the demonstration began, Sweeney 
told the World that civil disobedience is "part of the labor 
movement's arsenal. It is certainly a way of showing 
solidarity," he said. "It worked for the civil rights 
movement and there is no reason why it can't work for the 
labor movement."</p>

<p>Sweeney said he would give Labor '96, the AFL-CIO's 
electoral campaign, a "grade of 9.9 out of 10" and that he 
"had no regrets whatsoever" for his decision to run for the 
presidency of the 13-million-member labor federation last 
year.</p>

<p>The Dec. 10 demonstration was the latest in the year-long 
struggle by members of Locals 34 and 35 of the Hotel 
Employees and Restaurant Employees who have been working 
without a contract since February. The main issue is the 
demand of the university that it have the unilateral right 
to contract out much of the work done by dining hall and 
maintenance workers.</p>

<p>Al, a plumber who declined to give his last name, has worked 
at Yale for 17 years. "I went to Yale right after graduating 
from high school - but not as a student," he said jokingly. 
Al sees the fight at Yale as a fight for the future of all 
working families. "We just have to take a stand," he said.</p>

<p>Last month the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) charged 
Yale with illegal retaliation against union members 
following two four-week strikes last spring. The illegal 
acts included the discharge of a part-time worker for 
supporting the strike, prohibiting certain employees from 
discussing the union, the involuntary transfer of a union 
steward to what amounts to solitary confinement, and 
refusing to honor contract language regarding payroll 
deduction of union dues.</p>

<p>In his speech Sweeney reminded university officials that the 
NLRB had found Yale guilty of violating federal labor laws. 
"Those are serious crimes," he said. "If members of the Yale 
Corporation board were members of the president's cabinet 
they would be forced to resign."</p>

<p>The Rev. Lillian Daniel told demonstrators that a Ph.D. from 
Yale is not needed to understand what constitutes a just 
contract. Then, in remarks directed at non-residents, she 
said she hoped that people would not take Yale's illegal 
union-busting activity to mean that New Haven is a "high 
crime city."</p>

<p>Rev. Boise Kimber, a leader of New Haven's African American 
clergy, called the struggle at Yale "a fight for the rights 
this country was founded on. It's a wrestling match against 
intolerance and wickedness in high places. It's a fight 
against a bottom line that keeps its workers at the bottom. 
I challenge Yale's board of directors and President Richard 
Levin to reexamine their values." Levin will be paid 
$350,000 in 1996, double his 1995 salary.</p>

<p>Among those arrested with Sweeney were Laura Smith, 
president of Local 34; Bob Proto, president of Local 35; 
Miles Rappaport, Connecticut secretary of state; John Olson, 
president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO; Joelle Fishman, chair 
of the Communist Party of Connecticut; and Blair Bertaccini, 
president of the Waterbury Central Labor Council. Those 
arrested face fines of $80.</p>


<h3>NLRB's Yale ruling sets precedent</h3>

<p>A recent NLRB charge against Yale has national importance. 
For many years, graduate teaching assistants at Yale have 
been trying to organize a union, the Graduate Employees and 
Students Organization (GESO). Yale has refused to recognize 
the union, claiming that grad students who work as teaching 
assistants are students rather than workers employed by the 
university.</p>

<p>A year ago it seemed possible that GESO could join with the 
other Yale employees in joint action to win contracts for 
all. As part of that effort, GESO called a grade strike last 
December and its members refused to turn in grades for the 
courses they teach.</p>

<p>Yale moved quickly to crush GESO, firing its members from 
their teaching positions, instituting academic disciplinary 
proceedings and blacklisting GESO activists. In the face of 
this, the strike was called off.</p>

<p>In its charge, the NLRB ruled that GESO members are 
employees covered by federal labor law, that they were 
engaged in a legal strike and that Yale acted illegally in 
taking retribution against its leaders and members. This 
ruling will give a boost to the growing unionization of 
graduate student teachers around the country, and to all the 
unions fighting for contracts at Yale.</p>
