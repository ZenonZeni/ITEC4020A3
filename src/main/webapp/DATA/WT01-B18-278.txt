Dear Colleague:

I am very pleased to invite you to attend the National conference on 
Marijuana Use:  Prevention, Treatment, and Researh, sponsored by the 
National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), National Institutes of Health 
(NIH).  This is the first national conference to focus on providing 
scientifically based information on marijuana to dispel myths, increase 
public awareness of the rising trends in marijuana use, and educate the 
public about the consequences of marijuana use, especially for young 
people.  Another purpose is to educate the drug abuse prevention and 
treatment communities about research results that can assist in prevention 
and treatment efforts.

This conference is one of the principal elements in the Marijuana 
Prevention Initiative, which the Secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, announced last December when she 
released the results of the 1994 Monitoring the Future study.  It responds 
to the significant upturns in marijuana use among 8th, 10th, and 12th 
grade students.

The conference will present outcomes of NIDA/NIH research that focus on:  
Extent of the Problem; What Marijuana Is, What It Does, and Where It Acts; 
Consequenses of Marijuana Use; and Research-Based Prevention and Treatment 
Approaches.  Scientists, the public, and practitioners will exchange 
information that can be disseminated through the media, national 
organizations, educators, juvenile justice authorities, and State and 
local antidrug coalitions.

We are very concerned about the significant increased use of marijuana, 
especially by young people.  This conference will synthesize and begin to 
disseminate scientifically accurate information about the consequences of 
marijuana use.  We know it will be useful to all who attend.

I encourage you to attend the conference.

                                    Sincerely,
                                    Alan I. Leshner, Ph.D.
