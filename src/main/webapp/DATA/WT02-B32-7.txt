The Food Scientist is concerned with the properties and behaviour
of food from the point of  origin, through different stages of
storage, transport, preservation or other transformations, including
industrial processing and domestic or restaurant cooking procedures,
to its use by the consumer.
<P>
A details study of Food Science requires a sound knowledge of
basic sciences in particular Chemistry, but with contributions
from Biochemistry and Microbiology.  This degree seeks to emphasise
the links between Chemistry and Food Science, and provides a sound
knowledge of both disciplines while examining in more detail those
areas in which the two sciences are most closely related.
<P>
The course is taught jointly by the <a href="http://www.chem.rdg.ac.uk">Department of Chemistry</a> and the Department of Food Science and Technology. It is of three years duration and undergraduates are required to work in the Food Industry for eight weeks in one of their vacations, normally at the end of the second year, in order to gain experience
which may benefit them in gaining employment at the end of the course.  A member of academic staff assists students in finding a company that will employ them for their industrial placement.
<P>
The course is organised in three parts and the topics studied
are as follows:
<P>
<b>Part 1 (two terms) modules include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to Food and Biotechnology
<li>Chemistry
<li>Biochemistry
</ul>
<P>
<b>Part 2 (three terms) modules include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Chemistry
<ul>
<li>Inorganic chemistry
<li>organic chemistry
<li>analytical chemistry
<li>physical chemistry
<li>computing
</ul>
<li>Food Science
<ul>
<li>Food chemistry
<li>food processing
<li>nutrition
<li>introductory microbiology
<li>statistics
<li>food microstructure
</ul>
</ul>

<b>Part 3 (three terms) modules include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Chemistry
<ul>
<li>Organic chemistry
<li>complexes and enzymes
<li>photochemistry and membranes
<li>other topics.
</ul>
<li>Food Science
<ul>
<li>Advanced food chemistry
<li>food quality assurance
<li>microbial ecology
<li>industrial visits
</ul>
<li>Additional optional subjects such as management and commodities.
<li>Project: Part 3 includes an extensive research project which is carried out either in the Chemistry or the Department of Food Science and Technology.
</ul>
<B>Teaching</B><br>
Students attend lectures and participate in tutorials and seminars.
 These activities are supported by practical work in the science
and processing laboratories.
<P>
<B>Assessment</B><br>
All practical classes are assessed by continuous assessment and
contribute between 20 and 25% of the overall assessment in each
part.
<P>
<B>Part 1:</B>  Theory is assessed by a written examination after
Easter in the first year.  Students must gain an overall pass
in Part 1 with passes in the Chemistry and Food Science components
in order to progress through the rest of the course.  In the event
of a failure in the first attempt, each unit may be retaken once
in September.
<P>
<B>Part 2:</B>  Theory is assessed by a written examination after
Easter in year 2, and the marks from the Part 2 examination contribute
about 30% of the final degree mark.  Students who fail one of
more Part 2 units may retake them in September but may only gain
a pass in these units.
<P>
<B>Part 3:</B>  There is a written examination (Finals) at the
end of the course.  The class of degree awarded to a student depends
on the performance in the Part 3 project, the continuously-assessed
practical work and the Part 2 and Part 3 examinations.
<P>
<B>Prizes</B><br>
Prizes are awarded to the top students in each
of the Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 examinations.
<P>
<B>Entry requirements</B><br>
A minimum on two A-levels (or AS-level
equivalents) in science subjects to include chemistry.  Typically,
grades of CCD in 3 A-level subjects are required.  Good attainments
in other courses such as International and European Baccalaureates,
GNVQ, BTEC or Access courses, in appropriate subjects, will be
considered.
<P>
<B>Career opportunities:</B><br>
The multidisciplinary nature of
this joint course provides graduates with a background that is
suitable for a wide range of careers, and the size and complexity
of the food and chemical industries ensures that there is considerable
scope for career development in later years.  Appointments obtained
by our graduates in recent years include:
