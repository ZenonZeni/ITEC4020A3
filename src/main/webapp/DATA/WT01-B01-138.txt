<B>PRESS FREEDOM UNDER BORIS YELTSIN<P>

A Balancing Act for Media <BR>
Covering Chechnya and Government Leaders<BR>
</B><BR>
The war in Chechnya, a central campaign issue, has shown itself to be a proving ground for those in the Russian media determined to provide uncensored coverage despite government pressure to present a sanitized picture of events in the breakaway republic.<B><BR>
</B><BR>
The hypothesis that the media, in a frightened scurry into the Yeltsin camp, would begin to parrot official Information Department statements that "there is no war" has generally proven false.<P>

The print media have generally kept up their critical coverage of the war. On April 5, for example, the state wire service ITAR-TASS interviewed the villagers of Shalazhi, which was destroyed by a federal forces air raid despite a peace agreement with the Kremlin-installed government of Doku Zavgayev. The interviews forced the government's information officers to issue contorted justifications: "Although in accordance with the president's decree, large-scale military operations in Chechnya have ceased, we must respond to provocations from the fighters and conduct special operations to destroy them." Also in April, <I>Komsomolskaya Pravda</I> noted, "The intensity of the fire has not lessened in the slightest along the entire line of resistance." And night after night, Russian television continued to contrast pictures of the shelling and blockading of Chechen villages with official pronouncements about seeking a peace process. <P>

But both state-owned and independent television stations have suffered reprimands, harassment and personnel shake-ups widely believed to be related to their critical coverage of the Chechen war and the president's performance:<P>

<B>RTR</B>--On Feb. 15, 1996, Oleg Poptsov, head of the state-owned station RTR was dismissed because, as President Yeltsin explained in remarks quoted by ITAR-TASS that day, "His channel painted everything black ... [broadcasting] a load of rubbish ... morbid stuff. ... There are corpses here, corpses there. This is wrong." Poptsov had long been under pressure to resign because of RTR's unfettered broadcasting of the carnage in Chechnya. <P>

<B>NTV</B>--In 1995, the government threatened to pull NTV's license over its coverage of Chechnya, and for a time, was attempting to prosecute a satirical puppet show called "Kukly" for "insulting" leaders. (The charges were eventually dropped in October 1995). In July 1995, the prosecutor opened up a case against NTV correspondent Elena Masyuk after she refused to reveal the whereabouts of a Chechen leader she had interviewed. The charges were ultimately dropped, but Masyuk was threatened again by authorities in December 1995 when she covered the story of a Chechen fighter's deposit of a cesium cylinder in a Moscow park. On Feb. 12, 1996, NTV was barred from news conferences in the Kremlin and<B> </B>prevented from covering Yeltsin's campaign trip to Yekaterinburg. The harassment stemmed from NTV's airing of hostile remarks made by Yeltsin's former press secretary. Ultimately the flap died down, and NTV regained access to the Kremlin.<P>

Since Igor Malashenko, president of NTV, the only privately owned Russian television station, joined the Yeltsin re-election campaign in April as chief media advisor, many have been concerned that his station's coverage of controversial issues would be toned down. In May, the station continued its excellent coverage of the war, but muted its previous caustic remarks about the president--a change some independent observers believed was necessary anyway, because the station's past record of ad hominem attacks occasionally raised questions about its objectivity. When Yeltsin arranged the signing of a cease-fire to commence June 1, NTV's broadcasts displayed skepticism.<P>

Malashenko's support of Yeltsin appears driven not just by fear for the media's independence after a Communist takeover, but by a promise that he could obtain all of Channel 4's bandwidth, which is currently divided between NTV and state television. In letters to the president obtained by <I>Izvestia</I>, Malashenko claimed he could achieve more for the campaign if he had the whole channel. Malashenko denies any such "deal," but has stated for the record on Radio Liberty: "Although I have not conducted any negotiations on that score, my new civic assignment [i.e. the Yeltsin campaign]<I> </I>will not prevent me from turning down Channel 4 if it will in fact be offered to NTV. I believe the channel should be entirely NTV's, entirely independent of the fact that I am the president's consultant ..." <I>Izvestia</I> believes that such close and repeated contact with Yeltsin is bound to increase Malashenko's chances of getting the channel--if his advice works in the campaign. The entire affair underscores the enormous degree to which even the most independent media rely on the government's good graces.<P>

<B>ORT</B>--Independent observers have noted that ORT, the public television station in which the government has 51 percent ownership, has moved noticeably to the right in the weeks before the campaign. One obvious indication was the hiring of notorious reactionary television host Alexander Nevzorov from St. Petersburg television. Nevzorov, a nationalist parliamentary deputy, was apparently brought on to help Yeltsin attract the nationalist vote with a new tabloid television program called "Days." Ratings were poor, however, and the show's name (and time slot) were soon changed to "Nights." (<I>Izvestia</I>, April 13, 1996).<BR>
<B><BR>
The Yeltsin Campaign's Manipulation of the Media</B><P>

Using the power of his office, President Yeltsin and his campaign aides have made several unveiled efforts to influence and control media coverage of the election race.<P>

<ul><li>Aware of the dwindling influence of the print media, Yeltsin's campaign managers have not focused their pressure on mainstream newspapers but instead have orchestrated a mass distribution to 10 million homes of a lavishly published anti-Communist broadsheet called <I>God Forbid!</I> The tabloid, which is published without a masthead, carries lurid stories of the horrors of communism and has falsely claimed that a popular Hollywood soap-opera star favors Yeltsin in the elections. Yeltsin's representatives commandeered Roskompechat, the nation's largest news distributor, to circulate the paper, and they have been on hand everywhere to make sure this publication is distributed "properly." By contrast, <I>Izvestia</I>, now a respectable, privately owned daily of record that is read widely throughout the former Soviet Union and abroad, has a circulation of less than half a million.<P>

<li>During the election campaign, the Yeltsin administration set up a regional press agency under its jurisdiction on the initiative of Yeltsin's chief of staff, Nikolai Yegorov. Provincial journalists have been invited for weeklong, all-expense-paid trips to the capital and given access to top officials. The first group included 80 television and 60 radio correspondents who met with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin in May.<P>

<li>On May 6, <I>Newsweek</I> reported that it had obtained a letter dated March 21 from Yeltsin's chief of staff to local news services in Orel (a town known for heavy support of the Communists), advising that Yeltsin's staff was sending e-mail reports on the president's activities "for obligatory publication in the local state press [and for] broadcasting by local radio and television companies."<P>

<li>In May, at a conference of journalists' organizations in Rostov-on-Don, concern was expressed about pressures on the media during the presidential campaign, according to the May 6 issue of <I>Choice of the Regions, </I>a weekly electronic publication of the Russian-American Press and Information Center. Local Yeltsin campaign organizers came to the meeting unannounced and hijacked the agenda to proclaim to local reporters that "reduction in state support to the mass media during the reform years had engendered a drive to publish all information that might grab the reader's interest." The campaigner called on the region's journalists "not to forget their professional duty during the upcoming election campaign: to be objective."<P>

<li>According to the May 13 issue of <I>Choice of the Regions</I>, the Orenburg Region administration, made up of staunch Yeltsin supporters, vowed to become a co-founder of virtually every regional and city newspaper. Co-founders are needed for a newspaper to obtain and keep its registration status, which is essentially a license to publish. And government co-founders are needed to continue the flow of subsidies.<BR>
