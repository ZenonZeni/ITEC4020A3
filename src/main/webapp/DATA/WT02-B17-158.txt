<CENTER><H2>More About Gasification</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Biomass gasification is a process in
which heat and a gasifying agent, such as air or oxygen, are applied
to solid biomass to transform the solid into gaseous fuel molecules.
The gaseous fuel can then be burned in a gas turbine to generate
electricity.
<P>
Replacing less efficient conventional boilers with
advanced biomass gasifier or gas turbines can increase the amount
of electricity produced from biomass by 50% or more. For even
higher efficiency, the gas-turbine cycle can be combined with
the steam cycle in either an integrated gasifier combined-cycle
or steam injected gas turbine.
<P>
Gasification can take advantage
of biomass feedstocks unsuitable for direct burning. When biomass
fuels are burned in conventional boilers, the inorganic materials
that do not burn stick to boiler walls and reduce efficiency.
Many fast-growing, desirable energy crops and residues have high
proportions of these inorganic compounds. Inorganic compounds
are removed during gasification as part of the cleanup process.
The filtered by-products are then recycled back to croplands.
<P>
According to feasibility studies sponsored by the Program, three
types of gasifiers&#151;fixed-bed, fluidized-bed, and entrained-flow
gasifiers&#151;make economic sense when used in conjunction with gas
turbine-generators. They are used in a direct-fired mode in which
air or oxygen is fed directly to the gasifier, or in an indirect
mode in which externally supplied heat is used to gasify the biomass.
<P>
Gasification with air produces a low-Btu gas, with a heating value
about one-fifth that of natural gas. Indirectly heated gasification
and oxygen-blown gasification produces a medium-Btu gas, with
heating values as much as one-half that of natural gas.
