<B>3.3.3 Kernel-Driven Models <BR>
</B><BR>
A complete kernel-driven semiempirical model is formulated as a linear combination
of kernels. Most suitably it has the form<BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image69.gif" WIDTH="141" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN=
bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>which is derived from adding appropriate choices of geometric-optical
surface-scattering and radiative-transfer volume-scattering kernels, each
multiplied by a proportion <IMG SRC="symbols/image70.gif" WIDTH="11" HEIGHT=
"9" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">or <IMG SRC="symbols/image71.gif" 
WIDTH="34" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">that weights the
contribution of each model. These proportions may be regarded as the areal
proportions of land cover types exhibiting each type of scattering (neglecting
multiple scattering between the two components), or as mixing proportions
for land cover types that display both a volume-scattering and a geometric-optical
contribution to the BRDF. The quantities <I>kgeo</I> and <I>kvol</I> are
the respective kernels; the factors <I>fgeo</I> and <I>fvol</I> are their
respective weights; and the term <I>fiso</I> is the isotropic contribution.
Using the kernels presented above, there will be two choices for <I>kvol</I>
and three for <I>kgeo</I>, providing six possible models (disregarding here
the four sets of internal parameters used for the Li kernels). The formulae
for <I>fiso</I>, <I>fgeo</I>, and <I>fvol</I> are shown in <A HREF="#anchor4966489">Table
4.</A> <BR>
<BR>
In the inversion and fitting of a semiempirical model to data, estimates
of the weights <I>f </I>are retrieved from bidirectional reflectances and
specification of viewing and illumination positions. Although this objective
satisfies many of the goals of the BRDF/Albedo product, the existence of
formulae for the weights <I>f </I>in terms of physical parameters could
provide for direct inference of physical parameters from the weight values
fitted (see <A HREF="#anchor5015771">Section 3.3.5</A>). This possibility
will be explored in the postlaunch phase as a research topic. <BR>

<A NAME="anchor5014790"></A><B>3.3.4 The Modified Walthall Model</B> <BR>
<BR>
Empirical models can be understood as being of the kernel-driven model type
as well, where the kernels are empirical functions. An example is the modified
Walthall model, derived by Walthall et al. (1985) and improved by Nilson
and Kuusk (1989). It has the form<BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="symbols/image73.gif" WIDTH="221" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN=
bottom NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Note that this is the same form as the semiempirical models discussed
above-it is comprised of a weighted superposition of functions of angles,
and the weights <IMG SRC="symbols/image74.gif" WIDTH="28" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN=
middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">are the parameters of the model. As a consequence,
models like the modified Walthall model can be processed along with linear
semiempirical models by the same linear inversion scheme.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor5015771"></A><B>3.3.5 Advantages of Linear Models <BR>
</B><BR>
Linear models have a number of advantages in the context of global data
processing. Linearity in BRDF models is comprehensively discussed by Lewis
(in preparation) and demonstrated with the modified Walthall model. A first
advantage is that any linear model can be inverted analytically through
matrix inversion for the system of equations obtained by setting the derivative
of the error function to zero (see <A HREF="brdf5.htm#anchor3868792">Section
3.2.1</A>). This provides direct estimates of the parameters <I>fiso, fgeo</I>
and <I>fvol</I> while avoiding numerical inversion problems. <BR>
<BR>
Second, both the directional-hemispherical and bihemispherical integrals
of the BRDF (black-sky and white-sky albedos) may be precalculated for each
kernel individually. The albedo of a model then is simply the sum of the
kernel albedos, weighted by <I>f</I> values. By using a look-up table, numerical
integration of the models can thus be avoided. <BR>
<BR>
Third, linear BRDF models scale linearly in space if adjacency effects are
assumed to be small. This allows for mixed pixel cases, as indicated by
the areal proportion parameter <IMG SRC="symbols/image75.gif" WIDTH="11"
HEIGHT="9" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">in the model factors listed
above. This feature also allows scaling BRDF and albedo from one spatial
resolution up to a coarser one, e.g., to a particular resolution needed
for a climate model. Finally, since some of the parameters driving the models
are dependent on wavelength while others are not (e.g., structural parameters),
it may be possible to extract all or some of them from multiband analysis,
making assumptions about the others. <BR>
