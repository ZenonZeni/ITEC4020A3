CONCAWE published the first of its product dossiers in 1992. The series,
which will include 11 volumes (of which seven are already published, see
box below), was conceived to help the industry's approach to classification
and labelling, risk assessment and the provision of information in safety
data sheets. Each volume is prepared jointly by CONCAWE's Petroleum Products
and Health Management Groups and summarizes all the information available
on a major petroleum product group, dealing with typical properties, toxicity,
health hazards, exposure limits, safe handling advice, emergency treatment,
disposal, fire and explosion hazards, and environmental hazards. It also
identifies entries in the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical
Substances (EINECS) for each main product group.

<p>The dossier series enables
companies to comply more easily with the EU's Existing Substances Regulation
which requires the provision of all available data on substances manufactured
in, or imported into, the EU.<br

The latest in the series, to be published shortly, is called Gas Oils
(diesel fuels/heating oils). These middle distillates are used mainly in
blending fuels for use in diesel engines and for domestic and industrial
heating. CONCAWE has identified 68 gas oil entries in EINECS that can be
used to blend the fuels covered by this dossier. They are grouped into four
generic types: straight run, cracked, vacuum and other. The typical concentrations
of each needed to produce the three main types of fuel (automotive diesel,
heating oil and marine gas oil) are listed in the table below. The typical
properties of the three main fuel types are listed in the table. This dossier
does not cover heavy vacuum gas oil components.

The dossier provides detailed data on the many studies that have been made
on the acute and sub-acute toxicity of these fuels when ingested by mouth,
inhaled or after skin contact. It also reviews the data on skin and eye
irritancy, skin sensitization, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and reprotoxicity.
The toxicity chapter alone cites 66 references. The effects on human health
are summarized with the conclusion that, under normal conditions of storage,
handling and use as fuels, gas oils do not present a risk to health, providing
regular repeated skin contact is avoided. Special care is needed when gas
oils are used as solvents, or where repeated skin contact is possible.<BR>

The final chapter concerns the effects of gas oils on the environment. The
chapter concludes: 'If gas oil is released to the environment, it will be
subject to a number of loss processes. Lighter components will evaporate
and be photo-oxidized by atmospheric reaction with OH radicals. Higher molecular
weight components may also be subject to photo-oxidation but will also adsorb
to soil and sediment. In aerobic soils and sediments most gas oil components
will be subject to biodegradation but under anaerobic conditions gas oils
are persistent. Gas oil components are predicted to bioaccumulate on the
basis of their high octanol/water partition (Kow) coefficients, but the
available literature suggests that organisms are able to metabolize gas
oil hydrocarbons. The aquatic toxicity data on gas oils indicate that acute
LL50/EL50 values* for aquatic organisms are in the range 1 to 100 mg/l.
However there are few available data generated using accepted protocols
for oil products and the current database should be interpreted with caution.'
