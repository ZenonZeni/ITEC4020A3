Zoltek - Carbon Fiber for <BR>
Mass Market Applications</H2>
by Anthony Sutton, Portfolio Manager

<HR>

<P>
Harkening back to a vision of Dustin Hoffman getting career advice in "The Graduate," Zoltek conjures up one word (OK, two): carbon fiber.  And just like the silver screen advice advocating plastic as the future, carbon fiber will revolutionize the composition and quality of almost every product imaginable.  Not only is it six times stronger and two times stiffer than steel, it’s lighter than plastic.  Unfortunately, past applications of carbon fiber were hampered due to extremely high prices that limited it to government or defense uses.  Not any longer.

As the accompanying chart illustrates, as prices have fallen, the actual and potential applications have exploded in number.  Examples of new applications abound.  For example, Zoltek is working  with Morrison Molded Fiberglass Company to assist in the manufacture of automotive drive shafts that are 60% lighter in weight, yet twice as strong.  They have teamed with Thiokol to produce high volume, earthquake-proof, wrapping for bridge columns.  There is even an effort to produce the world’s longest I-girder bridge as a pedestrian crossing in Kentucky’s Daniel Boone National Forest.  These few examples are in addition to Zoltek’s more traditional relationships, such as their alliance with TRW to be the sole provider of carbon fibers for automotive airbags.  As Zoltek’s proprietary process drives the cost of carbon fibers down below $5 (their goal for the year 2000), the uses for it will explode into the high volume consumer market.
<P>
The change in seasons reminds us of the adage that change is a permanent component of life.  By being unemotionally invested in aggressive growth stocks (i.e., constant change), Cabot clients will participate in the tremendous growth affiliated with "change" stories such as Zoltek’s.
