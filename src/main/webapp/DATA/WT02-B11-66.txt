<P><FONT SIZE="4"><B><I>Brazil Project Advisor</I></B> is a monthly report
that focuses exclusively on identifying  infrastructure investment opportunities
unfolding in Latin America's largest market &#150; and helping you benefit from
them.</FONT></P>
<HR>
<P>Every month <B><I>Brazil Project Advisor</I> </B>brings you the
information you need to decide how to allocate your time and resources to
succeed in four major areas now set for long-term expansion:</P>
<UL><LI>Telecommunications</LI>
<LI>Energy (Oil &amp; Gas, Power</LI>
<LI>Roads, Railroads, Ports and Airports</LI>
<LI>Water Systems and Waste Treatment</LI></UL>
<P><B><I>Brazil Project Advisor</I></B> provides continuous coverage of new
developments in these areas &#150; and it does so early in the development
cycle, when there is still time for you to get involved. Our network of
on-the-scene correspondents and close contacts with key players in the public
and private sectors gives you the information and insight you need to profit
from this expanding economy.</P>
<H3>Communications - $75 billion over 8 years.  </H3>
<UL><LI>Plans call for raising the number of installed phone lines from 14.3
million to 40 million by 2003; boosting cellular lines from 1.9 million to 17.2
million; expanding cable television coverage from the present 700,000
subscribers to 16.5 million.  To attract the investment needed to complete these
plans, the government is opening the telecommunications industry to private
participation. </LI></UL>
<H3>Transportation - $30 billion over 10 years </H3>
<UL><LI> Brazil's network of roads, bridges, railroads, airports and ports are
all due for major overhaul and expansion. Right now the government is in the
process of privatizing the railroad network, which will result in hundred of
miles of track being recovered over the next decade. Road-building concessions
are slowly being awarded, and the offerings are expected to accelerate in the
coming months and years as federal and state governments and companies gain
experience in private management of road systems.
</LI>
<LI> Airports are in dire need of modernization. Demand for new communications
systems, radar and other equipment is expected to soar over the next 10 years.
</LI>
<LI> The ports modernization program is in full swing. One project alone, which
will link the state of Minas Gerais to the Vitoria ports complex, is expected to
cost more than $2 billion. 
</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Energy - $23 billion over four years  </H3>
<UL><LI> Government projections say Brazil will have to build more than 15,000
MW of new generating capacity over the next 4 years at a cost of  $23 billion.
Such magnitudes of investment will be attracted through the privatization of the
federal and state systems. This process has already started. Over the next few
years a building boom is expected as private interests take over government-owed
hydroelectric plants that are stalled and build new ones under  independent
power production schemes.
</LI>
<LI> Natural gas will be added to the Brazilian energy mix via pipeline
connections with Bolivia and Argentina.  Brazil and Bolivia continue to work on
the details of the proposed $2 billion 2,377 km natural gas pipeline that would
link reserves in Bolivia with markets in southern Brazil. A completed pipeline
would spawn a series of power plants along the pipeline route. 
</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Water Systems and Environmental Services  - $40 billion over 10 years </H3>
<UL><LI>This sector is ready to absorb large quantities of new investment.
Only 30% of the population are estimated to have access to both clean water
supplies and adequate sewage and sanitation services. A recent study found that
only 10% of the nation's sewage receives any treatment at all. With increasing
frequency municipalities as well as state and federal governments are turning to
the private sector to manage expansions of water and sewage systems.</LI></UL>
<P> </P>
<CENTER><H3>Exclusive project intelligence at a great value </H3></CENTER>
<P>Gathering information on this array of project activity is time consuming
and expensive.  Our team of professionals can bring you the inside track on
these projects &#150; systematically and reliably, throughout the year. Getting
the same information yourself on Brazil's complex project development
environment would cost thousands of dollars, take hundreds of hours of your time
and require a team of people. With <B><I>Brazil Project Advisor</I></B> you
get focused information about what is happening, who is involved and where your
best opportunities are, all for less than the price of a single plane ticket to
Brazil.  </P>
<P><B><I>Brazil Project Advisor</I></B> normally sells for $595 per year, but
for a limited time we are pleased to offer you this new service at the charter
subscription rate of $495.  And this offer is risk free.  If at any time you
find that <B><I>Brazil Project Advisor</I></B> does not provide the guidance
to Brazilian infrastructure opportunities you seek, we will refund the cost of
all unmailed issues.  </P>
