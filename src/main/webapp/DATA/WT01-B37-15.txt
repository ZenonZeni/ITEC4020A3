<p><font size="4">Anguish in Blue Needn't Become Deadly</font><font
size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">By Joseph D. McNamara</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Newsday - April 9, 1996<br>
</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Police suicides, police corruption and
misconduct, high rates of alcoholism, divorce and mental
breakdowns among cops all offer grim confirmation that police
work is grueling and stressful. Gilbert &amp; Sullivan said it
best a long time ago: &quot;A policeman's lot is not a happy one,
when the constabulary's duty is to be done.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The constabulary's job is particularly hard in
New York City: A study last year reported a rate of 29 suicides
per 100,000 for the NYPD, versus 12 per 100,000 for the general
population. And in a telling episode, off-duty Officer
Christopher Gargan of Merrick pulled out a Glock 9-mm. weapon at
a St. Patrick's Day concert and fatally shot himself in the head.
He was only 22.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nevertheless, in New York and elsewhere,
departments are helping officers deal with psychological stress.
These improvements not only benefit officers and their families,
but spare citizens the consequences of unstable cops.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Of course, a lot of the stress in policing is
unavoidable. Cops aren't invited to birthday parties and
weddings. People dial 911 only when someone's bleeding or dead.
Cops get catapulted from tedious duties into moments of terror
and danger, and relentless closeups of human degradation. . Along
the way, it becomes far too easy for the police culture to label
the world as overrun by dirtbags, ingrates - and other cops. Even
entry-level police work is stressful because, unlike rookies in
most other large organizations, patrol officers have to make
instant life or death decision.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If those decisions are wrong, officers can end
up in the morgue, the emergency room, the internal affairs unit
or even prison, like the cops who assaulted Rodney King.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During my years as a police chief, I discovered
a number of strategies that helped dilute the strew, thus
protecting the-public from over-the-edge cops. First, pre-hiring
psychological screening is essential. Believe it or not, many
police agencies still fail to do adequate background
investigations of recruits. Bad cops are hard to get rid of once
they obtain civil service tenure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">And people carrying badges and guns who don't
belong in police work are under tremendous personal anxiety. They
are also time bombs who raise apprehension throughout the ranks.
People with a history of psychological problems should not be
hired as police officers, period.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">On the other hand, even stable people can come
unglued in police work. The beat police departments are the ones
that drop the John Wayne syndrome and train their personnel to be
aware of the inevitability of stress and how to cope with it.
Instruction. on proper diet, exercise and how to avoid financial,
marital and family problems can all help cops cope with job
pressures. Training courses on these subjects are as important as
those on the law of arrest.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Free confidential psychological consultation is
another essential for officers and their families. It turns out
to be a bargain for the public in savings on disability pensions
and lawsuits resulting from police misconduct</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In addition, police management can take steps
to broaden a cop's world. Too often, departments allow officers
to sink into a police culture that emphasizes the violence and
depravity cops see. In my experience, the overwhelming majority
of citizens are law-abiding and want to work with the police to
make their neighborhoods safer.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">But if officers simply respond to scenes of
crime and violence, they miss the positive: owners' and renters'
meetings, parent-teacher gatherings, student conferences and
business community meetings. They miss the opportunity, as well,
to discover citizens who support good police work. The public,
for it's part, loses the opportunity to discover that most
officers are warm human beings eager to explain their jobs and to
show people how to prevent crime.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Given a chance, ordinary citizens can come to
appreciate what cops do; and this greatly increases public
confidence. Relating to normal public values also encourages cops
to break the police code of silence and to help in weeding bad
cops off the force.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">One ironic source of stress is that police
officers consistently underrate how much the public respects
them. The police would handle personal pressure better if they
knew that most people value their work. For example, a recent
Gallup poll showed that 52 percent of the public expressed high
confidence in the police, surpassed only by confidence in the
military and organized religion. The police rating was much
higher than that for business, Congress, the presidency or TV and
other news organizations. And why not? What's wrong with a line
of work that aims to protect human life and to prevent innocent
people from being victimized by law-breakers?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Overall, the best way to minimize stress in
policing is to run a good police department. That means a
department that acts in partnership with community groups. It
means a department with the vision and courage to take the steps
necessary to minimize public stress about both crime and bad
cops.<br>
