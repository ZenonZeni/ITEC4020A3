<h2 align=center><i>Helping Children with Learning Disabilities to 
Succeed</i></h2>

<p><b>Create Appreciation of the Written Word</b><br>
Long before children are able to engage in reading themselves, they must
feel that reading is something they would like to do. They must develop an 
appreciation of the pleasures of written language and of the many ways 
language is useful. 

<p><b>Develop Awareness of Printed Language</b><br>
Children need to develop a basic sense of what print looks like and how it 
works. They must learn how to handle a book, which way to turn the pages, and 
that the printed words -- not the pictures -- tells the story when you read. 
Children should be taught that words are all around them-in newspapers, mail, 
billboards, signs, and labels -- and have many different and valuable purposes. 

<p><b>Learn the Alphabet</b><br>
Comfortable and early familiarity with letters is critical for learning to 
read. Children should learn the names of letters and to recognize and form 
their corresponding shapes. 

<p><b>Understand the Relation of Letters and Words</b><br>
Children need to learn that printed words are made up of ordered strings of 
letters, left to right. They should be helped to understand that when the 
combination or order of letters is changed, the word that is spelled also 
changes. 

<p><b>Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables, and
Phonemes</b><br>
The ability to think about words as a sequence of phonemes is essential to 
learning to read an alphabetic language. Children should become aware of the 
building blocks of spoken language. They need to understand that sentences are 
made up of strings of separate words. They should become comfortable in hearing
and creating rhymes. They should be led to play with the sounds of language 
until they can pull words apart into syllables, and pull syllables into 
individual phonemes.* 

<p><b>Learn Letter Sounds</b><br>
Given a comfortable familiarity with letters and an awareness of the sounds of 
phonemes, children are ready to learn about letter-sound correspondence. The 
most important goal at this first stage is to help children understand that 
the logic of the alphabetic writing system is built on these correspondences. 

<p><b>Sound Out New Words</b><br>
As children learn specific letter-sound correspondences, they should be 
challenged to use this knowledge to sound out new words in reading and writing.
Making a habit of sounding out unfamiliar words contributes strongly to reading
growth, not just for beginners, but for all readers. Children need to 
understand that sounding out new words can actually be a strategy for helping 
them unlock pronunciations of words they have never seen before, and can make 
what they are reading understandable.

<p><b>Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily</b><br>
The ability to read with fluency and comprehension depends on recognizing most 
words almost instantly and effortlessly. Once the framework for a new word or 
spelling has been laid, through sounding and blending, the key to recognizing 
it quickly and easily is practice. The most useful practice is reading and 
rereading of meaningful text made up of words the child has been taught to 
sound out. For beginners, such reading helps most if it is relatively easy. As 
a rule of thumb, no more than one in 20 words should cause trouble. 

<p><b>Know Spelling Patterns</b><br>
As children become reasonably capable of sounding out words in reading and 
spelling, it is important that they notice the similarities in their spellings.
Awareness of spelling patterns that recur across words hastens progress in 
reading and writing, and weak knowledge of spelling is an impediment to mature 
readers. 

<p><b>Learn to Read Reflectively</b><br>
Although the ability to sound out words is essential for learning to read, it 
is not enough. Written language is not just speech written down. Instead, text 
brings new vocabulary, new language patterns, new thoughts, and new modes of 
thinking. To enjoy and profit from reading, children must also learn to take 
the time to reflect on these aspects of text. 

<p>_______________________<br>
*A phoneme is the smallest functional unit of speech. (The word "cat"
contains three phonemes: the /k/, /a/, and /t/ sounds. Letters often
represent more than one phoneme -- the <i>a</i> in "cat" is a different
sound than the <i>a</i> in "cake" -- and sometimes a single letter will
contain more than one phoneme. For example, the word "ox" has two letters
but three phonemes, /o/, /k/ and /s/). 
Fluent readers learn to recognize these discrete sounds of spoken words 
quickly, accurately, and automatically. Phonemic awareness is the foundation 
on which all other reading skills are built. <br>
