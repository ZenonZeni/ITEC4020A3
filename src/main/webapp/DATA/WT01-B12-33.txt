 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HEART DISEASE </H2>


 <P>  Heart and circulatory disease is the number one killer in America today.  Heart disease and strokes kill over a million people each year -- more than accidents, cancer, diabetes, pneumonia and influenza combined!</P>

<P>   The circulatory system is one of the most critical systems  in  the body  for our overall  health  It supplies all the organs and tissues with nutrients and carries away the waste products of metabolism. The heart and brain need enormous amounts of oxygen to function properly. Senility and heart disease (as often seen in older people) usually comes as a primary result of decreased circulation.</P>
<P>   Atherosclerosis is a condition of plaque build-up in the medium  and  larger  sized  arteries.  Research indicates that there must be some form of injury to the lining  and/or  muscle  tissue  of  the  arteries  for atherosclerosis to even begin.   Because free radicals definitely cause irritation, inflammation and cellular destruction, it is believed that they can cause injury to the walls of the arteries allowing plaque to begin building up. Therefore, supplementing with substances that counteract free radicals only makes sense.</P>
<P>  The liver produces a protein called fibrinogen.  It circulates in the blood and when it comes in contact with damaged or diseased tissue, it is changed into fibrin protein and sticks to the damaged tissue to form a clot. When free radicals cause injury to the lining of arteries, the fibrin protein sticks to the injured wall and forms a sticky net which traps cholesterol type compounds, heavy metals and other substances.  As the lining heals, the proteolytic enzymes in the blood are then supposed to break down the fibrin.    Individuals  who  have  a  lower  activity  of proteolytic enzymes have a great chance of developing excess blood clots and atherosclerosis.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ANABOLIC AND CATABOLIC</H2>
<P>  CARDIO-CHELEX is the only product of its kind because it is catabolically balanced and contains proteolytic enzymes, plus natural chelating vitamins and amino acids. Recent innovative research shows that all metabolism (the chemical reactions in the body) fall into one of two categories:  (1) anabolic, or  building-up processes, and; (2) catabolic, or tearing down processes. The formation of a blood clot is an example of an anabolic process because it "builds" the clot. In time, the clot must be "broken down" (a catabolic process) by the proteolytic enzymes. If the body is too anabolic, the clots and plaque will remain and begin to accumulate.</P>
<P>   It has  been  shown that both  atherosclerosis  and hypertension are correlated with too much anabolic activity  which  builds  up  plaque  in  the  arteries. CARDIO-CHELEX contains many special nutrients that support catabolic activity. For this reason, several anabolic nutrients are intentionally not included  in CARDIO-CHELEX. CARDIO-CHELEX is not designed as a multiple vitamin like <A HREF="mtvm.htm">TVM-49</A>.   It is formulated with specific nutrients for specific effect. However, when taken in the morning and with Support Tabs  in the afternoon, you receive the value of a multiple type supplement as well as the advantage of the separate formulas.</P>
<P>   Prolonged stress causes the body to produce excess fatty acids and remain too catabolic. The body then reacts by producing excessive anabolic sterols like cholesterol, which can become trapped in the sticky fibrin on the cell walls.  One important reason exercise is so important in preventing cardiovascular disease is because it burns the excess fatty acids produced in reaction to stress, thus less anabolic sterols are produced in the body.  The special catabolically balanced nutrients in CARDIO-CHELEX, combined with a reasonable amount of exercise, is a winning combination in the prevention of heart disease.</P>
<P>  CARDIO-CHELEX contains over 47 special nutrients that work synergistically for the overall nutritional support of the circulatory and immune systems. They can be classified as (1) catabolic sulfur-containing amino acids, (2) proteolytic enzymes, (3) concentrated tissue nutrients, (4) vitamins, (5) minerals, (6) herbs, (7) natural chelating nutrients, (8) anti-oxidants, (9) free radical scavengers, and (10) immune stimulants.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CARDIO-CHELEX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CARDIO-CHELEX</H2>
<P>   If you are under 40 and in relatively good health, five tablets once a day, first thing in the morning, is recommended. If you are over 40, or your family has a history of heart problems, or you have a special need, take 5 tablets twice a day, first thing in the morning and mid-day. Some individuals may notice an "uncomfortable feeling" at first when they begin taking CARDIO-CHELEX as it begins pulling pollutants and toxins out of the body. If this happens to you, wait two days and start again with one tablet daily for two days and then increase by one tablet every two or three days. Five tablets in the morning plus five tablets around mid-day is the ideal amount.  Certain nutrients are intentionally deleted for specific effect. Combined with <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS</A> as in the <A HREF="mqpak.htm"> Life Plus QPAK</A> , you get the best of both worlds.  That is, you get the advantages of the specific effects of both products plus all the value of a multiple as well.</P>


 <P>
Suggested Use:  Five tablets once or twice a day preferably first thing in the morning and right before
