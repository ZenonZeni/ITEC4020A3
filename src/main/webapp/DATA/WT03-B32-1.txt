Hubble Repair Mission Trainer
Howdy, Hubble

This past December was a milestone in space history. During December,
NASA mounted one of its most ambitious effort since the Moon landings,
the Hubble Telescope repair mission. As anyone who has been on Earth for
the past few months probably knows, this mission required six EVAs
(extra-vehicular activity) of more than six hours each. In two person
teams, astronauts removed, replaced and repaired many components of the
Hubble telescope. What interests us about this mission is that it was the
first time that VR was used as a significant part of mission training,
both for flight crew and ground-based team members.

We first reported on the Hubble Mission Trainer in our November/December
1992 issue. At that time Bowin Loftin and his team working in the
Software Technology Branch at the Johnson Space Center (Houston, Texas)
had just finished their first prototype of the system. We found it
exciting and innovative. During the last months of 1993 the system was
put into operation. NASA used the system as an auxiliary training tool
for 121 Flight Controllers, real people with line responsibility, who
relied on the system for real training, for a real mission.

We spoke with several people involved with this training project, and the
consensus among them is that this was a highly successful training
technique. Said Page Lucas, a Flight Controller, and the liaison between
the Controllers and the Software Section, "I thought this was a very
efficient way to train flight controllers. It exceeded my expectations."
She explained that this was because the VR system helped them visualize
and understand procedures and equipment much better than the standard
books, models and diagrams.

As Lucas explained, the system was used for 200 hours of training. Each
team member spent about 30-40 minutes in the system on two separate
occasions. People used the system in groups of three, with one person in
the HMD and the other two watching monitors. There was continuos verbal
interaction among the team members.

The training was designed to provide basic understanding of each EVA,
therefore the simulations were simplified in scope and reduced in time.
The astronauts needed six hours to complete the COSTAR installation, but
in the simulation, the task was done in one hour. Most tasks were divided
into two parts, which were worked through on separate occasions.
Simplification involved eliminating details like bolt removal, and moving
into position to do various jobs. What was left was the essence of each
task, such as order of operations, the locations of and familiarization
with components, and the cooperation needed on EVA teams. In Lucas'
words, the training ensured that "flight controllers were all speaking
the same language on the Hubble mission". Using the VR system, she told
us, controllers were able to more quickly visualize and understand
procedures.

According to Steve Potter, Payload Training Supervisor, "we really liked
the system. It really tied [the operations and procedures] all together."
He explained that this type of training has been done using traditional
2D drawings, procedure descriptions, and scale models. While those
techniques work well, VR adds another modality that is especially useful
for those with different learning styles. He would like to see more
detailed graphics and interactions, but felt that the system met his
expectations very well. His group is now looking at other areas of
training that may benefit from this interface, including pilot and
commander training, and further payload operations training.

Lead Timeline Officer, Alan Bartos, was enthusiastic about the system,
his first VR experience. He has responsibility for scheduling operations
during a mission. The VR system gave him a new outlook on the
requirements of various tasks. "Seeing it in action gave us a new
appreciation for what had to happen and how it happens. I thought it was
really excellent." This deeper understanding helps him know which tasks
fit together well, so the crew's time is used more efficiently.

A similar system was used by the flight crew to evaluate Remote
Manipulator System, (RMU, the robot arm) planning, and to refine the
choreography of moving the large and delicate arm and its cargo. The RMU
was used both to move the Hubble itself, as well as a mobile work
platform for the astronauts. The VR simulator used by the astronauts
modeled the arm controls, located in the aft cabin of the space shuttle,
and also permitted the Mission Specialist to "grab and move" the arm to
check positioning.

Tim Saito, Senior Software Engineer, pointed out that the VR system is
only supplementary at this time. The system is constrained by computing
resources and the quality of HMDs. However, the entire team, both the
developers and users of the system, feel that this first training
exercise was a great success. The Software Technology Branch is already
starting their next training system, which will be used for the scheduled
Hubble maintenance mission in 1995.

While there are obvious shortcomings in this system, we feel that it is
of historical significance. We believe that this exercise was the first
to use VR on this scale, over 100 participants, and for this length of
time, over 200 hours of training. It is important that this was real
training, not a evaluation of a demo system. Probably most important,
everyone involved feels that the VR simulation added value to the
training regimen. We salute NASA and everyone who developed the Hubble
Mission Trainer for a job well done.

VR NEWS AND INFORMATION

The price of HMDs continues to drop.  The newest entry into the HMD arena
is the VFX1, a joint development of Advanced Gravis and Forte
Technologies. The new unit, which was shown for the first time at the
Winter Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas, is a full color, medium
resolution design with PC interface. The VFX1 incorporates two Epson
AMLCDs to provide stereo 428 x 244 resolution with a 46.4: x 35.2: field
of view. Included is Forte's 3DOF, proprietary, hybrid tracking system,
called Virtual Orientation System (VOS), providing pitch, roll and yaw
data. Input may be either PAL or NTSC video, with stereo sound optional.
VFX1 is compatible with Advanced Gravis' UltraSound 3D sound card, and
other sound cards. It also includes a VESA features adapter which
interfaces its controller card to standard VGA display systems. The
weight of the actual unit is not yet determined, but is expected to be
less than 2 pounds. Ergonomic features include adjustable interpupilary
distance (IPD), and the "Smart Visor", an optics mounting system that
lets the user pivot the optical unit out of the line of sight. Focus
adjustments are independent for each eye. The unit also adjusts for head
size.

The VFX1 is scheduled for release in the 3rd quarter of 1994 at a retail
price of under us$1,000. We have also been told that the HMD may be made
available without the VOS tracking system, and the VOS will be sold
separately at an as yet undetermined price, starting this coming Fall. We
are told that many major game developers, including Electronic Arts and
LucasArts Games are writing software for the system.

New graphics, auto safety and entertainment are keeping the folks at
Division busy these days. The announcement which may have the most
impact on  world builders is that Division has debuted their new 100 VPX
graphics system. Based on the University of North Carolina's Pixel
Planes architecture, this single board implementation includes 8,192
processors that provide two channels of video output providing either a
stereoscopic display, or high throughput monoscopic video. Two to the
EISA form-factor boards can be used in together to increase throughput
further or to provide four video channels. The 100 VPX is rated by
Division at 300,000 texture mapped, Z-buffered, specularly lit polygons
or spheres per second. The graphics system is available as a stand-alone
for inclusion in OEM systems for #12,000 or in an integrated system, the
ProVISION 100 VPX, for #50,000.

Working with Volvo UK, Division has developed a crash simulator that
Volvo is using as a selling tool at auto shows. Running on a ProVISION
system, the simulation models the interior of a Volvo 850, its exterior,
the countryside and another vehicle. The animation of the experience
matches a current Volvo advertisement, in which the Volvo is struck from
the side at 25 miles per hour. Designed to illustrate the strength of
the side impact protection system, the model will also be used for
training and ergonomic evaluation.

Finally, two entertainment companies have announced liaisons with
Division. UK-based Global Entertainments has formed a new subsidiary,
Virtual Reality Games, Ltd., that will develop a new series of
interactive entertainment systems using Division equipment and
consulting expertise. The American company, Alternate Worlds Technology
also recently announced that they will be building systems based on
Division hardware and software. Kevin Williams, formerly with Hughes
Rediffusion, has been appointed to head Division's interaction with the
entertainment industry.

This past November, Realidad Virtual, of Madrid, demonstrated a new
VR environment at SIMO, Spain's largest annual computer fair. Alice
Through The Monitor was developed for the company America Iberica to
publicize their range of computer magazines. The environment
incorporates four worlds, each containing advertising for America
Iberica's various publications. The user can explore the worlds, and
hunt various types of marine life. Entrance is through a bottomless pit
based on the rabit hole in Alice In Wonderland; the user falls past
doors, each of which leads to one of the other worlds. Despite each user
at the fair only having two minutes to play, the queues were enormous.

The program was demonstrated using the EyeGen3 HMD and a Polhemus
FasTRAK. It was written with PC version of WorldToolKit by Sense8, and
runs on a 33Mhz 486 and two SPEA FIRE boards. Portaling between the four
worlds was used to reduce rendering complexity and time.

The last chapter?
Thomson CSF to Purchase VPL Patents

By Kenny Meyer

VPL Research, Inc. will sell its assets, including its patent
portfolio, to Thomson CSF for us$150,000. The sale is part of a
Chapter 11 reorganization that VPL filed in US Bankruptcy court
on November 12.

VPL initially filed for Chapter 11 protection last March when
it needed protection from numerous creditors and a foreclosure
suit brought by Thomson. Thomson was foreclosing on loans that
were collateralized with VPL's patent portfolio.

The VPL patent portfolio includes two optical flex sensor
patents, the glove control patent, "3D Swivel" licenses, and, at
least, ten additional patent applications covering a range of
key technologies. Many of the applications were filed in both US
and Europe. These intellectual properties would give Thomson a
strategic holding in the VR industry since they could bring
considerable resources to bear in any patent protection suit.

As part of the proposed $150,000 purchase, Thomson will
forgive approximately $2 million in loans to VPL. However, the
plan allows Thomson to retain claim to a $150,000 DIP loan
(Debtor-in-possession) made last September. VPL used the DIP
loan to cover the cost of maintaining the patent portfolio.
Thomson will acquire VPL's assets free and clear without liens
and encumbrances.

Unsecured creditors do not fair well under VPL's plan.
Unsecured claims, totaling approximately $1.5 Million, will be
paid $0.05 on the dollar. Among the unsecured creditors is Tom
Zimmerman who is owed $212,000 for royalties on VPL's important
glove control patent. Zimmerman invented the DataGlove and is
listed as an inventor on several VPL patents.

After the sale of assets to Thomson, VPL will change its name
and the company will be liquidated under Chapter 7. Neither
VPL's president, Jean-Jacque Grimmaud, or Comptroller, Alan
Defrenne, are planning to join Thomson or any new company formed
by Thomson with the acquired assets.

The court is scheduled to approve the reorganization on
February 16. A previous approval date was rescheduled because of
objections from one of VPL's unsecured creditors.

Recent VR Books: Readers' Roundup

The end of 1993 brought a flurry of new VR books. Some of them were
really quite good, others left a lot to be desired. While we will
continue to do complete reviews of new books that we feel are highly
significant, we are starting a new feature, Readers' Roundup, that will
provide capsule reviews and ratings of the deluge of VR books hitting the
shelves. Here is the first installation of Readers' Roundup.

Ratings:
* * * * * 5 Books, required reading
  * * * * 4 Books, worth having
    * * * 3 Books, about average
      * * 2 Books, may be useful
        * 1 Book, wait for the movie

* * * * * Pictorial Communication in Virtual and Real Environments,
second edition, Edited by Stephen R. Ellis with Mary Kaiser & Arthur J.
Grunwald.

Thirty-nine chapters cover topics from Environments to Seeing and
Knowing. This is a rigorous work that discusses many aspects of our
sense, and how to fool them into believing that virtual worlds represent
something real. In the Prologue, Editor Ellis says, "The theater of human
activity is an environment which may be considered to have three parts: a
content,  a geometry, and dynamics....The following discussion develops
an analysis of these parts which is then applied..." That summarizes the
mission of this book, which is accomplished well. This is not a
beginner's book, but is worth the effort required. Ellis and his
co-editors are involved with NASA's VR work and provide a high degree of
experience and understanding.

Published by Taylor and Francis, London, UK, ISBN: 0-74840-0082-6, 615
pages, soft cover, illustrated, indexed, US$39.50.

* * * * * Garage Virtual Reality, Linda Jacobson.

LindaJ, as she is know on the nets, never ceases to amaze us. This, her
second book, is not only an informative, fact-filled base for those
starting in VR, its a ton of fun to read. Jacobson knows many of the
famous and soon-to-be famous personalities she profiles, and her personal
affection for them and the topic shows. Garage VR is intended for those
who can't afford an SGI but want to get into VR anyway. It provides a
solid historical perspective, an ample number of resources, instructions
for building a PowerGlove interface, some software, and profiles of the
leading garage VR hackers. We suspect that this book will be the
launching pad for some of the VR heroes of the future.

Published by Sams Publishing, Indianapolis, IN, USA, ISBN: 0 672 30270 5,

Kalawsky.

This is the first VR book obviously intended as a text, and it is
thorough and complete. Kalawsky works at British Aerospace, and has been
involved in simulation and VR for quite a while. Provided a step by step
explanation of all of the components of VR systems, the reader of this
book will have a comprehensive understanding of the field upon completion
of the volume. One significant blemish is the unacknowledged use of a
substantial amount of material from the journal, "Presence".

* * * * * The Virtual Community, Howard Rheingold.

Rheingold is well known in VR circles, having been among the first to
write on the subject. In this book he turns his sights on a larger
target: the community in cyberspace that has flourished in various
on-line venues. VR is a minor part of the subject matter, but the
implications of electronic community hits each of US with equal impact.
He sings the praises of the great potential, he warns of the risks.
Rheingold's first person narrative is an easy read, but his ideas and
facts warrant careful consideration.

* * Virtual Reality in Engineering, Edited by Kevin Warwick, John Gray
and David Roberts.

This book is visually unpleasant, printed in a large, clunky type that
makes it look cheap. It is a collection of loosely connected chapters
that were mostly written by professors, and indeed, the book "is based on
a Institution of Electrical Engineers vacation school held at the
University of Reading (UK)". The style is didactic, and very
Anglo-centric. We found the approach somewhat round-about, for example,
in the section titled "A definition of virtual reality" the author
provides a full page of discourse, but leaves the reader lacking a
concise definition. As close as one gets is the opening sentence,
"Virtual Reality can be described as the science of integrating man with
information". This book provides some useful reference material, but is
lacking as a stand- alone tutorial.

* * * * Virtual Reality Creations, Dave Stampe, Bernie Roehl, and John
Egan.

This book isn't for people who want to read about VR, it's for people who
want to make VR. Included is a disk and Fresnel 3D viewer. On the disk is
REND386, probably the best-known VR shareware program, and a collection
of sample worlds. The book provides a introduction on VR, and an overview
of VREAM and Superscape software, but the choice stuff starts in the
middle. That's where the REND386 tutorial is. This book was written by
the developers of the software, and provides a complete programmer's
reference to it. If you want to build virtual world's and have a limited
budget, get this book.

* The Virtual Reality Primer, L. Casey Larijani.

Some one at McGraw Hill must have decided they needed a VR book, FAST.
This book is disappointing from cover to cover. It's full of factual
errors, misconceptions, and cute, irrelevant cartoons. Save your money.

* * * * Walkthroughs & Flybys CD, Phil Shatz.

 While this isn't strictly a VR book, it does offer some great examples
of what VR should look like. Unlike many computer books, where an
accompanying disk adds a bit of interest, in this case the book is only
there to provide details on the enclosed CD-ROM. Holding 538 megabytes of
(did you guess?) walkthroughs and flybys, this CD-ROM provides plenty of
ideas and examples to anyone who is designing 3D interactive graphics.
The author presents this book as an art collection, who are we to
disagree. Each demo is described in detail. It's too late for Christmas,
but maybe you know somebody who has a birthday soon. If they have a
CD-ROM player, get them this book.

New York VR Expo 93
Maybe There is Money in Virtual Reality

The big news at the first New York Virtual Reality Expo,
produced by the Meckler organization and co-sponsored by
CyberEdge Journal, was that is was big. Nearly 400 people
attended conference session or tutorials, more than that
attended the first ever VR Video festival, produced by Louis M.
Brill. There were two evening Keynote speeches, one by Robert
Stone, head of the Advanced Robotics Research Lab in Salford,
England, and the other by CEJ Publisher and Editor, Ben Delaney.
There were 34 exhibitors, and there were a couple of thousand
people who came to see them. Finally, the event concluded with a
full-day Venture Capitol Forum, during which fourteen budding
entrepreneurs made presentations about their companies, and
their growth opportunities.

Another interesting note was the composition of the crowd.
Unlike most West Coast shows, the cyberpunk contingent was most
noticeable by its absence. The people at this show were business
professionals, conservative in dress and manner. They were there
to see if there is money in VR. As their focus was finance and
business, so will be the focus of this report.

>>The business of VR

The first business-oriented session brought together two
veterans of the VR production house business and one of the few
market researchers in the field. Chet Dagit, Director of
Business Affairs for WorlDesign (Seattle, Wash, USA) discussed
their experience in getting a world building company off the
ground. From Dagit's presentation, we see that it may not be
easy. In his discussion of Financing and Fund Raising, he
recited a litany of every problem known to small businesses:
lack of capital, difficulty in attracting top people, being
unsure of the product, and the paradoxical problem of no
practical experience and no way to get it. "It sounds clichid",
he said, "but know your customer." In fact, much of Dagit's
presentation was clichid, which doesn't mean it was unimportant,
but that the problems of starting a business are universal.
Dagit emphasized, though perhaps unintentionally, how important
it is for those getting into the VR business to understand not
just VR, but also business.

A more successful experience was related by Ian Capon, form
the London VR studio, Virtual S. Capon and partner Peter
Williams co-founded Virtual S in April of 1991 with the mission
of providing commercial VR for what ever purposes their clients
found appropriate. With a client list that includes Canon Office
Products, Volvo, British Telecom, Compaq and others, Virtual S
may be the most prolific VR production facility in the world.
Capon described their purpose-built worlds, and explained that
the objectives of the clients were primarily one of two:
building trade show volume or product introduction tours. While
these worlds are largely custom designed, Virtual S makes use of
a common production strategy; they re-use modules, slightly
customizing them for individuality. This saves a substantial
amount of time, and enables them to provide high quality at a
relatively low price.

Capon offered a few insights that may be valuable for others
entering the world of VR production for hire. "The full
potential of VR will only be realized through great
productions", he said, emphasizing that "virtual reality isn't a
computing technology, it's more like the telephone of the
future", ubiquitous and easy to use. He also stressed the need
to make effective use of the technology that works, especially
sound. He described the professional, multi-track sound
production facility in the Virtual S studio as providing an
important finishing touch to the visual aspects of worlds. "We
enphasize audio", which he pointed out is, "one of the most
important, and undersold parts of virtual reality". Capon came
off very professionally, as a man with a commercial sensibility
and a bottom-line orientation, and was refreshing in his candor.

A report on market considerations in VR entertainment was
provided by Carrie Heeter, from Michigan State University (East
Lansing, MI, USA). For nearly two years Heeter has been doing
research on the demographics and motivations of players of VR
games, specifically BattleTech players in both Chicago and
Walnut Creek, California. Her conclusions, based on hard data,
present an interesting picture of BattleTech aficionados, and
offer guidance for others entering the VR LBE arena.

Heeter found that 93% of BattleTech players are male, but
that women may be attracted if the games become less
militaristic. 62% of players played more than four times, while
an impressive 42% have played more than 10 games. Repeat
business is essential to financial success, and the factors that
keep 'em coming were no surprise: "It's fun", It's
exhilarating", It's challenging", "The staff is friendly".
Interestingly, the sixth most popular reason is "It's fun to
blow up people", which belies some of the more noble rationale
offered for these games. The players are not fools, however,
with 86% having at least some college attendance. Heeter
believes that virtual travel may be a strong draw for women, and
notes that there is a strong correlation between VR game fans
and science fiction readers. Heeter's research will be published
later this spring in its entirety.

>>Voices of experience

From William Bottoms, Senior Vice President at the investment
firm of Patricoff and Company, came a fascinating look at the VR
industry from the investor's point of view. Patricoff was an
early investor in VPL Research, having put in us$50,000 in 1986,
and is part of the group which recently brought the Virtuality
Group (formerly W Industries) public. His presentation was a
primer in funding, tempered by as much experience as any
investor has had in the VR business, which is, he said quoting
Jaron Lanier, a bit "like surfing in an avalanche of boulders".

Bottoms sees a tremendous potential for VR, which he expects
to be the preferred interface for simulation, communication,
artificial intelligence and multimedia applications. The success
of the VR industry will be driven by its ability to reduce cost,
improve interfaces, and implement efficient programming methods,
he cautioned. Bottoms identified six areas of immediate
opportunity for entrepreneurs and investors in VR:

     *  Sensors
     *  Telemetry
     *  Display technology
     *  Graphics engines
     *  Software development tools
     *  Programming/Applications

Patricia E. Glovsky, of the Polygon Capital Group, started
off by polling the audience. The show of hands indicated that
20% were already running a VR company, 10% were looking for
funding and 5% were investors. She discussed the objectives of
large funders: a 1000% or greater return in 5-7 years, and
stressed the importance of a business plan that demonstrates
that income potential. One way to provide that return is a
public offering, the strategy taken by Virtuality Group,
Division, and Virtual Universe in the past year. While this may
be quite profitable, it imposes significant up front expense and
ongoing regulatory burdens on the company, and needs to be
considered carefully. Glovesky's talk meshed well with
Patricoff's to provide a good foundation for budding VR
capitalists.

We were impressed with this show. Once again, the Meckler
organization and conference chair, Sandra Helsel did a good job
of providing solid organization and valuable information. The
show floor was bustling, and many of the vendors with whom we
have spoken told us they did good business. The two evening
sessions were not well attended, and probably need either more
promotion, a scheduling change, or to be dropped, but that was a
minor flaw in what was otherwise a worthwhile show.

Criterion's RenderWare
PC Renders at Startling Speed

What's faster than a speeding bullet, but less powerful than
your average workstation? It's a PC running the new RenderWare
software from Criterion Software, a spin-off of Canon's UK
Research Centre. RenderWare is an interactive, 3D graphics
programming API for Microsoft Windows and other environments.
That means that you won't find it on the shelves of your local
software emporium. RenderWare is intended for developers, and
provides them with a set of routines that dramatically
accelerates 3D graphics on PCs with no special hardware. It is
based on new algorithms, first reported here in our May/June
1992 Industry Outlook section, on which there have been 20
patent applications filed worldwide.

Criterion showed RenderWare at recent press conferences in
New York City and San Francisco. They demonstrated its
capabilities on a Toshiba 486/DX50 laptop computer with 12
megabytes of RAM. The system will run in 4 MB, in our office we
have run it easily in 8MB, in our standard Windows
configuration. (A Gateway 2000 486/DX33 EISA, 256-color, 1068 x
780 ISA video, Windows for Workgroups 3.1, Norton Desktop 2.2,
and various other Windows programs.) David Lau-Kee, lead
developer of RenderWare, and President of the new company told
us that on the demo system, we were seeing texture mapped,
animated, lighted images being updated at a rate of 40,000
polygons/second. The subjectively rated frame rate was about 15-
20 fps. On our office system, we observed a frame rate of about
10-15 fps, but this still exceeds the performance of any similar
package we have seen. The demos presented by Criterion included
reflective and other surfaces texture mapped on various objects.
This texture mapping, according to co-developer and VP of R&D,
Adam Billyard, "doesn't cost you anything as far as performance
is concerned". The demo also permitted one to use "drop and
drag" techniques to pick up new textures and objects, and drop
them into a RenderWare window.

Criterion rates the software at 40K poly/sec on a 486/DX50
using a 4K polygon model transformed, clipped, painted and
software double-buffered in a 400 x 400 pixel viewport.
Performance scales with CPU power. The software is written
entirely in C, with no operating system dependency, making it
easily portable. The geometry for RenderWare scenes is stored in
a proprietary ASCII format, with converters for other file
formats included. The use of ASCII makes the building of self-
modifying worlds fairly simple. At this time, only 8 bit color
is supported, but 16 bit color and true color support are in the
works, as is sound support. The library of 32 bit code is about
300K in size.

Features

*       Available now on Windows 3.1, Macintosh, Sun (X11). Windows
     NT available soon

*       Multiple light sources supported

*       Multiple orthographic and perspecive views

*       Texture mapping

*       Environment mapping

Now, more than ever...
1993 Conference Rankings

If you went to each of the twenty-one conferences we rank here, you would
have seen over a thousand speakers. You would have heard some
entertaining, informative, innovative presentations and some dull,
derivative, boring ones. You would have seen around 15,000 slides and
nearly as many overhead cells. It would soon become obvious that the
length of the list of initials after a speaker's name is not indicative
of the quality of thought or presentation.

You would have seen 839 exhibits at these 21 shows. They ranged from a
tablecloth on which was placed some equipment and brochures, up to
multi-hundred-thousand dollar show stands. They were attended by close to
three thousand enthusiastic salespeople. Some of them were staffed by
attractive young ladies who were apparently not chosen for their VR
expertise. You would have quickly realized that the price of the exhibit
has no bearing on the quality of the products.

During the 65 days of these symposia, you would have eaten 41.6 awful
pre-made sandwiches, drunk 382.6 cups of luke-warm coffee, waited 33.8
hours in line for lunch and dinner, spoke to about a zillion people and
hauled off 418 kilograms of paper, much of which you discarded in your
hotel room. You wore out 2.1 pairs of shoes.

>It comes down to dollars

Conferences cost a lot to attend, and can provide major paybacks. They
can also be major time and money wasters. Last year, 56,123 people
attended the conferences we list here. Each spent an average of three
days in attendance, plus travel time, let's say 1-1/2 days for travel for
each person. That makes 252,535.5 days spent at VR conferences last year
(691.9 years!) Assuming that each person's time is worth $200 a day (a
very conservative estimate), that time was worth $50,510,698! Plus, each
person paid an average of $510 for each conference, a total of
$28,609,367 in all. Add to that the cost of plane fares, hotel and
restaurant charges and other incidentals, and you have a hefty sum.

>Getting your money's worth

That's why we provide these Conference Rankings each year. Like the rest
of the VR industry, the conference business has grown. Unlike the rest of
the VR industry, the conference business is very profitable. And also
unlike much of the VR industry, conferences effect nearly everyone in the
business. Either you attend a conference, or the people you're trying to
contact are attending. Regardless of your level of involvement, it's
important that you spend your time and money wisely.

A few notes on how to use the rankings. Most important is how well the
conference program fits your information needs. There are essentially
four types of conferences included here: Scientific VR meetings, VR trade
shows, Special-interest VR gatherings, and Non-VR shows that include a
significant VR component.

Remarkable as it may seem, not every 1993 VR conference is included in
our rankings. We know of at least four others for which we were unable to
obtain information by press time. This year we will redouble our efforts
to get this information for every important meeting.
RAIS, our overall top ranked conference,
Informatique, or the IEEE meeting were your best bets last year, and
probably will be next year, too. They provide a preponderance of research
papers, most juried, and provide complete sets of proceedings. There are
fewer exhibits at these meetings, usually less social activity, and lot's
of data.

For people with a general interest in VR, and for executives and
marketing types, the VR trade shows are the most useful. These are
generally bigger shows, with major exhibit areas, and more social
activities, ideal for networking. Many new products are introduced at
these shows, and usually attendees get to try them out.

The special interest shows are hard to summarize, since by definition,
they are narrowly focused and esoteric. Two of these stand out as
providing exceptional programs: the Virtual Reality and Persons with
Disabilities Conference, and the International Conference on Cyberspace.
The former is explained by its title. The Conference on Cyberspace is a
unique meeting, bringing together presentations on the social impact of
new technologies, the importance of gender in cyberspace, providing
access to new technologies to disadvantaged people, and much more. It's
wild and woolly, and very exciting.

The non-VR-specific shows include the biggest listed here: SIGGRAPH and
Technology 2003. SIGGRAPH is the computer graphics show the whole world
waits for. With hundreds of exhibits, scores of presentations, thousands
of attendees, and dozens of parties, SIGGRAPH is all things to all
people. VR has taken root here, and though it is a small part of the
bigger picture, SIGGRAPH is an important VR show. The other
non-VR-specific shows have various foci, and provide VR as an important,
but secondary, part of the program.

Our rankings this year, the third year we've provided them, are produced
in essentially the same manner as previous years. Each conference is
rated on a 0 (awful/none) to 10 (excellent/all) scale in eight
categories. These raw scores are weighted to reflect the importance of
the categories, for example, Percent VR is weighted 2.5 times more
heavily than Entertainment/Parties. The weighted scores are then
normalized on a 0 to 10 scale that is used for the actual ranking. As
noted earlier, the content of each conference is more important than the
absolute rank, as you decide how well it meets your needs.

Finally, we must note that two of these conferences were co- sponsored by
CyberEdge Journal. They are the Virtual Reality and Persons with
Disabilities conference, and the New York Virtual Reality Expo. We have
made every effort to rate these conferences objectively, but feel that
you need to know of our affiliation with them.

>>The Top Ranked Conferences<<

We are presenting the rankings in three parts this year. the first
section ranks conferences by type. The second section provides overall
rankings, while the final chart gives you the detailed information on
which the rankings are based. We hope this helps you with your planning
for the coming year, and applaud everyone who works so hard to make these
conferences worthwhile.

Virtual Environment Products
Avoiding Product Liability Suits

By Paul E. Paray and James P. Jenkins, (C) 1994

NOTE: The opinions set forth in this article are solely those of the
authors and do not represent official NASA policy on any issue discussed.

Mention the words "products liability" to a virtual reality product
manufacturer and you might get a blank stare in return. Many virtual
reality product manufacturers are simply not in tune with the broad brush
devastation this theory of law can inflict on a growing company's
overhead. Some creative lawyers and inventive expert witnesses have
generated a cottage industry by using pseudo-science to influence
juries,. With proper due diligence, virtual reality product manufacturers
can avoid having to waste time defending lawsuits and waste money in
increased insurance premiums.

The law of products liability is generally easy to understand but
difficult to apply. Under the law of most states, one who manufactures,
distributes, or sells a product in a defective condition unreasonably
dangerous to the user is subject to liability for physical harm caused by
the product if 1) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a
product and 2) it is expected to and does reach the user without
substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.  Lawsuits can be
pursued against the seller of the product even if the seller has
exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of the product
and the user or consumer of the product has not bought the product from
or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.  Simply put,
the manufacturer, distributor or seller is strictly liable to the
consumer for all injuries sustained from use of the defective product
after the product has entered the stream of commerce.

Under the law of most states, the existence of a "defect" or unreasonably
dangerous condition is a prerequisite to recovery. A product may be in a
defective condition, or unreasonably dangerous to the user, by virtue of
a manufacturing defect, a design defect, or inadequate warnings or
directions. Whether a product has a "manufacturing defect" can be
determined by comparing it with other units from the same assembly line.
A product with a design defect is not reasonably fit, suitable or safe
for its intended purpose.

Some states provide that a manufacturer or seller is not liable for any
injuries to a user if at "the time the product left the control of the
manufacturer, there was not a practical and technically feasible
alternative design that would have prevented the harm without
substantially impairing the reasonably anticipated or intended function
of the product." Because this "state-of-the-art" defense is based on the
state of the scientific knowledge, it tends to expand faster than its
assimilation by industry.

Lastly, a product may be unsafe if it fails to adequately warn
foreseeable users as to dangers inherent in the use of the product. Sound
business practice requires virtual reality product manufacturers to fully
explore current technology and potential liability issues before products
are marketed for public use.

Virtual reality product manufacturers should be concerned with the
perceived possible physical effects of HMDs and electromagnetic tracking
devices placed near the body.  Most of the tracking devices on the market
employ an electromagnetic sensor technology. These tracking devices
generally operate at over 100 Hz, and they are placed near users for only
short periods of time. Whether the short term exposure to fields
generated by electromagnetic tracking devices can cause harm to users has
been given little mention in the virtual reality literature.

Although ionizing radiation such as x-rays or gamma rays are able to
knock-out electrons from atoms and cause damage to DNA and tissue,
non-ionizing radiation such as ELF-EMFs do not displace electrons as they
pass through tissue. Evidence is inconclusive that human exposure to
ELF-EMF electric and magnetic fields can increase the risk of cancer and
leukemia. (See "Extremely Low Frequency Electric and Magnetic Fields and
Risk of Human Cancer, 11 Bio-Electromagnetics 91, 92 (1990)). Indeed, a
good deal of research indicates that there is no danger due to extended
ELF-EMF exposure. For example, a study conducted by Southwest Research
Institute that was reported in the September 1993 Industrial Health &
Hazards Update indicates that exposure to 60 Hz electric and magnetic
fields on non-human primates did not cause significant problems.
Notwithstanding this research, the fact remains that the choice of which
exposure parameters constitute a proper safety zone is difficult to
measure.

Paul Brodeur, in a series of New Yorker magazine articles and two books,
the latest one titled The Great Power-Line Cover-Up: How the Utilities
and the Government are Trying to Hide the Cancer Hazard Posed by
Electromagnetic Fields, has created a cottage industry by speculating as
to the dangers of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields
(ELF-EMFs). These fields are in the 30-300 Hertz (Hz) range.  Although
commentators in the August 5, 1992 issue of the Journal of American
Medical Association state that any conclusion of human health risk due to
ELF-EMF exposure is premature, the fact remains that there are vocal
groups seeking to exploit any ambiguities in the medical literature. One
such group is a nation-wide group of lawyers who collectively call
themselves the Electromagnetic Radiation Case Evaluation Team (EMRCET).
EMRCET seeks out ELF- EMF cases in order to create legal precedents for
subsequent cases. In other words, they generate business by using the
popular media to sensationalize phantom dangers and exploit fears.
Several courts have recently rebuked such tactics. For example,
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Administrative Law Judge Hubert
Smolen ruled in September of 1993 that evidence of dangers associated
with ELF-EMFs "taken as a whole remains inclusive".

Even without the medical evidence, there are ELF-EMF products liability
lawsuits being filed and there is money being spent defending these
suits. According to an article in the November 2, 1993 Wall Street
Journal, more than a hundred lawsuits and regulatory disputes involving
EMF complaints have been filed nationwide. Because present virtual
reality technology relies heavily on electromagnetic tracking devices,
safety concerns and preventive litigation techniques should be analyzed
while the industry is in its infancy.

Although there is no reason to believe the electromagnetic tracking
devices are anything but safe, there is still no available talisman to
ward off groups such as EMRCET and the circulation-driven media.
Accordingly, there are three business strategies virtual reality product
manufacturers can employ to better the likelihood that a jury will
determine a product is safe.

First, virtual reality products manufacturers should obtain a basic
understanding of the proper use of warnings. A product may be unsafe if
it fails to adequately warn foreseeable users as to dangers inherent in
the use of the product. This duty to warn is a continuing one. It
requires a manufacturer to provide warnings of dangers that the
manufacturer discovered or reasonably should have discovered after the
product left its control. Courts use an objective standard to determine
the adequacy of a product warning. An adequate warning is "one that a
reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances would have
provided with respect to the danger, and that communicates adequate
information on the dangers and safe use of the product, taking into
account the characteristics of, and the ordinary knowledge common to, the
persons by whom the product is intended to be used. . . ."

Simply put, a product warning must illuminate the mind of the reasonable
user by explaining risks not reasonably appreciated when a product is in
use. A manufacturer's liability for failure to warn is always contingent
upon proof that the missing warning was indeed the proximate cause of a
plaintiff's injuries. And, the issue of proximate causation turns on
whether proper warnings by the manufacturer would have prevented the
harm. For example, in order to warn against the possibility of physical
injury due to movements made while navigating in cyberspace, it would be
prudent to offer a potential user an instruction leaflet or present a
video demonstration warning the user not to make sudden wide-ranging
motions while navigating in a virtual reality system. There is a
rebuttable presumption that a plaintiff would have followed such a
warning if it had been given.

Determining whether warnings and instructions are adequate is not an easy
task. For example, because a clear understanding of all potential hazards
and consequences of injury must be had before any warnings or
instructions can be created, it is difficult to determine safety
standards until a suitable institution or governmental agency imposes
some safety parameters.  After such information is obtained, several
important questions must be asked. Does the warning or instruction
describe how to avoid the hazard? Would the warning or instruction make a
difference?, i.e., would anyone bother to heed the warning or follow the
instructions? It may even be advisable to liken a virtual reality systems
experience with an amusement park ride and to list those persons who
should not "ride" in cyberspace.

Second, virtual reality product manufacturers should openly discuss
safety issues and pool health and safety information now that the
industry is still in its infancy. Shared safety research would benefit
all segments of the industry. Indeed, the common goal of building a
customer base for virtual reality products would be furthered if
manufacturers pooled their resources.

Third, the formation of a Virtual Reality Technology Business Consortium
would be a cost-effective means of dealing with these virtual reality
product safety issues. Associations such as the Product Liability
Prevention and Defense Group in Falls Church, Virginia already helps
manufacturers of machinery improve their defense against litigation.
Commensurate with their ability to pay and their percentage of activity
in developing virtual reality products, qualifying start-up companies
could even join this consortium.

Virtual reality product manufacturers are urged to address these issues
in a straightforward, practical manner before waves of lawsuits are given
a chance to materialize. Although it certainly does not make any sense to
begin preparing for a specific lawsuit before it is filed, virtual
reality product manufacturers are urged to consider implementing the
above measures in order to prevent the first suit from going to trial.
Similarly, it is also a good idea for manufacturers to meet with the loss
controls representative of their insurance carrier to discuss methods for
evaluating possible risks of loss before any claims are made. Simply put,
although entrepreneurs are by definition "risk takers," there is no
reason to gamble on the ingenuity of groups such as EMRCET.

 Given the fact that their products are placed so close to the body,
manufacturers of HMDs and electromagnetic tracking devices should be
particularly mindful of products liability issues. Although this article
focuses on electromagnetic tracking devices, it should be stressed that
both AMLCD HMDs (having high energy backlights) and CRT HMDs may actually
produce higher density EMF fields than electromagnetic tracking devices.

 A Hz is equivalent to one cycle per second.

to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, 3 kHz to 300 GHz" is a step in
the right direction, even the IEEE suggests that further research be
conducted.  See "Research Needs in Health Effects of Power Frequency
