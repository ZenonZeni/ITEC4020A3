   <i>When nothing seems to work against chronic pain or arthritis, often a hidden infection in the jaw is the cause.</i>
  </font><br>
   By Christopher Hussar, D.D.S., D.O.<br>
 </b>
<p>


Over the last 10 years, I've verified a secret about chronic pain. It may be caused by previously unsuspected infections in the jaw and can be easily eliminated through simple surgical procedures. <p>

	I say "verified" because, surprisingly, medical literature from the 1850s indicates that U.S. physicians were aware that chronic, untreated dental infections could produce serious symptoms elsewhere in the body. In fact, although this application has since been discredited, physicians once routinely recommended having teeth extracted as a cure for arthritis. 
The concept of chronic dental infections producing pain elsewhere in the body used to be more widely accepted in American medicine; these infections were known as a cause of "focal disease." 
Most American doctors and dentists seem to have forgotten this link but, since 1988, using an approach called neural therapy, I have performed thousands of dental procedures to remove chronically infected or dead bony tissue to relieve unexplained pain. <p>

The procedure is to inject a local anesthetic, such as procaine hydrochloride or lidocaine hydrochloride, into a scar, nerve ganglion, or an infected area of the jaw to numb then block the nerve flow—in this case, through a specific tooth or tooth site. This calms down the inflamed or overactive nerve at the site for perhaps 10 hours, so it stops sending pain messages to other parts of the body, whether it is the face, knees, or anywhere else. Often you will get a lightning-quick reaction, an instantaneous relief of pain. <p>

You can also use neural therapy to diagnose potential problems. If the pain is abolished with this injection, you can be certain you have found the primary problem site in the jaw. In other words, your teeth are connected to the rest of your body.
Using this approach, I have been able to reverse headaches, blindness, hearing disorders, arthritic pain, rheumatological problems, and all manner of unexplained pain disorders. This technique has given life back to people who were suicidal because of their ceaseless pain. <p>

<b>HEALING MARTHA'S KNEES THROUGH HER CANINES</b><p>

Martha, aged 86, suffered from arthritic pain in both knees. She had consulted numerous orthopedic surgeons, all of whom told her she had arthritis and should take aspirin for the pain. But Martha's pain was so excruciating she had difficulty standing and moving about; even wearing stockings hurt too much. It turns out the knees are associated with the 2 canine teeth in the mouth. 
When she was younger, Martha's teeth became infected and had to be extracted, but not until long after they should have been. She was then fitted with dentures. I injected lidocaine into the gum area corresponding to where each canine tooth would be if still intact. Seemingly in minutes, Martha was literally dancing in my office without her crutches, pain free. <p>

After that, I had to numb her canine area once every 2 weeks, then gradually only once every 2 months. Martha completely recovered and the last time I checked (as I subsequently relocated my practice), she was in her mid-90s and doing well.<p>

<b>MARINDA BECOMES PAIN FREE AFTER 13 YEARS</b><p>

Here is another case that shows how a hidden dental infection can create long-term pain if left untreated. Marinda, aged 55, had suffered with severe facial pain for 13 years. She estimated she had seen at least 50 doctors, including neurologists, oral surgeons, dentists, internists, and chiropractors, none of whom had helped her. A few of them wanted to put Marinda on the kind of medications normally given for hysteria. One dentist thought she had temporo-mandibular joint dysfunction and installed a bite implant, but it produced no change.<p>

She had acupuncture, which helped only briefly. When acupuncture doesn't hold, it can mean there is some kind of "focal"disturbance in the mouth that is blocking the flow of energy throughout the body. <p>

In other words, somewhere in the mouth, a tooth or hidden infection is focusing its unhealthy condition on other areas of the body—creating a dental focal disturbance—and possibly causing a disease.<p>

In Marinda's case, her lower jaw harbored a deep chronic infection that had wrapped itself around the major nerve trunk that passes through the jaw. This had probably originated with faulty dental extractions of her wisdom teeth. <p>

Unfortunately, dentistry still does not recognize that the area around the extraction site of most wisdom teeth is infected. Consequently, dentists often fail to properly clean out (debride) all the unhealthy tissue and dead bone from the site, thereby creating chronic infection. This can produce referred pain, which is pain felt elsewhere in the body rather than in the jaw. 
Marinda also had undergone a root canal and the bone around this tooth was dead, with a festering infection near the root canal. Technically, the root canal was unnecessary because it was done to help relieve the pain from the wisdom tooth socket.<p>

The dental sockets and ridges on the upper and lower jaws develop lesions or cavities as a result of chronic infections. The lesions are hollow, set inside the jawbone. They are often hard to spot through conventional X rays. <p>

When you open up these lesions, and see the mush that comes out, you can understand why these infection sites will not heal on their own. I have opened up sections of jawbones and taken out decayed vegetable matter such as corn and carrots that had become locked within the original extraction site and were not reabsorbed by the body. <p>

Inside these jawbone cavities you may also encounter viruses, bacteria, yeasts, and parasites, all of which contribute to the harmful dental focal disturbance. The mouth is the filthiest place in the body.<p>

I made a small incision in Marinda's jaw, giving me access to the inside. I was able to clean out the infection, irrigate the area with disinfectants, such as peroxide, ozone water, and selected antibiotics, then meticulously close up the jaw so nothing could leak into it. When I was finished with Marinda—the procedure took 2 hours—she had almost no postoperative pain and all her facial pain was gone. It never returned, either.<p>

<b>RESTORING THE RHYTHM TO ROBERTA'S HEARTBEAT</b><p>

Roberta, aged 40, is a nurse whom I treated recently for irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia. She had consulted other practitioners but none had been able to figure out the cause. I extracted a dead wisdom tooth and cleaned out the bone around it. The next day, Roberta called me to say that her arrhythmia had disappeared. <p>

The intriguing question is this: what is the connection between the tooth I extracted and Roberta's heart? The answer is that the tooth was situated on a special energy pathway, or meridian as described by acupuncture, called the Heart channel. 	
According to acupuncture, numerous energy pathways traverse the body, running from head to toe, and most of them pass through the jaw in direct association with specific teeth. Roberta's dead jawbone and infected tooth had a negative impact on her heartbeat through the energy channel connecting them.<p>

I've treated patients with chronic chest pain, mitral valve prolapse, and other heart conditions. When I cleaned out the chronic infection at their third molar, which is on the Heart meridian, I have been able to end the problem without any other intervention. All 4 wisdom teeth are on the Heart meridian which runs through both sides of the mouth. I speculate that some of the high incidence of heart disease in the U.S. may be attributed to chronic infections left over from faulty wisdom teeth extractions sending their negative influence through the Heart meridian to the actual heart.<p>

There is yet another dental connection with the heart. Usually, a prolonged infection makes the blood more prone to clotting, more likely to coagulate in undesirable ways. I advise my patients to take steps to thin their blood to prevent blood clotting which can lead to heart attacks. I often recommend niacin, Ginkgo biloba, L-arginine, garlic and fish oil, C and B-complex vitamins, homeopathic remedies, and regular vigorous exercise. In more serious cases, I will recommend the administration of oxygen under pressure (called hyperbaric) to increase the levels and distribution of oxygen in the body. <p>

One factor that seems to be a common denominator in my patients is a lack of adequate blood flow through the face and the entire body. When I send dental tissue out for a biopsy, often it comes back labeled "ischemic osteonecrosis." This means lack of blood flow (ischemia) related to dead (necrosis) bone (osteo) in the jaw.<p>

<b>POISONOUS ROOT CANALS</b><p>

Another source of hidden but chronic dental infection is the root canal. In the 1920s, a pioneering American dentist named Weston Price, D.D.S., while working for the American Dental Association, demonstrated that dead teeth and root canals could make people sick, producing  rheumatoid arthritis, heart and kidney disease, and other chronic problems. <p>

Dr. Price showed that in many cases, extraction of the root-canaled tooth and a thorough cleaning out of the infected jaw could reverse these conditions in a dramatically short time, usually in a few days. To prove how toxic the removed dental material was, Dr. Price sewed a root-canaled tooth under the skin of a laboratory rabbit. Within 3 days, the rabbit died from the same condition that had made the person ill. <p>

My colleague, Jerry Bouquot, D.D.S., calls the condition often produced by tooth extractions "NICO," for "neuralgia inducing cavitational osteonecrosis." A place in the jaw where a tooth has been removed, but in which an inflammatory bone lesion has developed, is called a cavitation. The bone cavitates, or forms a mushy depression (a cavity) subject to infection and the death of bone tissue. This results when the bone of the extraction site refuses to heal properly, literally leaving the root outlined.
This situation leads to dead bone (osteonecrosis) that produces nerve pain (neuralgia), usually in the head, face, neck, or shoulders. But NICO can produce problems elsewhere in the body, such as heart disease, low back pain, intestinal disorders, pain in the groin or legs, all without accompanying facial pain. 
I have treated many low back pain patients (sometimes 3-4 a day) by removing infected bone in the third molar area. Chronic fatigue and arthritic pain disappear in many patients with these conditions after I've removed their dental infections.<p>

<b>CROSSED EYES DUE TO INFECTED WISDOM TEETH</b><p>

Susan, aged 45, came to me with an eye condition diagnosed as "orbital pseudo-tumor." This means she had pain around her eyes, which were inflamed, but there was no physical evidence of a tumor, which would be the likely cause. Susan told me she had been to 50 doctors and had cost her insurance company $100,000 trying to find a cure.<p>

Susan was cross-eyed. My examination revealed that she had chronic infections in the upper wisdom teeth. In extracting her wisdom teeth, her previous dentist had broken off the root tips, leaving them behind in Susan's jaw where they festered, reducing the blood flow through the bone. This in turn caused a local inflammation and the eye problem.<p>

Unfortunately, this is quite common. In addition to the problem mentioned above of not cleaning an extraction area properly, dental surgeons often are sloppy about sewing things up tightly after surgery. It is essential to close up the jaw as securely as possible to prevent a reinfection.<p>

A few weeks after the surgery, Susan called me with great excitement. "You did it! My eyes have changed back. I'm no longer cross-eyed."<p>

The only down side to this case was that her insurance company would not pay for the surgery that cleaned out her infected jawbone. They were willing to spend $100,000 for medical treatment that produced no benefit, but refused to reimburse the $2000 for oral surgery—I billed it as a medical procedure—that actually cured the problem, because her policy did not include dentistry or surgery on the bones of the jaw. Apparently insurers believe the mouth is not part of the human body.<p>

With the "disproving" of the focal theory by our increasingly autocratic medical/dental complex, the concept of a chronic dental infection as a source of referred pain has gone practically unrecognized for 60 years.  I hope the examples provided here and the work of other forward-thinking dentists will help to change this. <p>
