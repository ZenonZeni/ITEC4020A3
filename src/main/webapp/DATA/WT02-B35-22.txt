Injection program to up yield at Norway's Snorre field

     Norway's Petroleum Directorate says estimated total reserves from the
Snorre field in that country's sector of the North Sea could soon be
upgraded by 20% to 1 billion barrels.
     That's possible because of a pilot project involving the alternate
injection of water and natural gas to increase exploitation yields.
     The field, discovered in 1979, is in blocks 34/4 and 34/7 about 125
miles west of the coastal community of Floro. Norway's Saga Petroleum is
operator of the field -- with Esso Norway as co-operation partner -- for
Deminex, Idemitsu, Norsk Hydro, Elf Petroleum Norge, Amerada Hess,
Enterprise Oil and DNO.
     The Snorre project is one of the most challenging of its kind. It is in
deep water, and the reservoir is extensive and complex. Exploration
drilling delineated the field during most of the 1980s, but sustained low oil
prices added to slow development.
     Original estimates put Snorre recoverable reserves at 77 million barrels
of oil, 247 bcf of gas and 1.8 bcf of natural gas liquids, with a field life
expectancy of 20-25 years. At its peak, original estimates were that field's
liquid output would average 190,000 b/d.
     Located in 985' of water, the field is the first truly deepwater
development in the North Sea. It consists of the largest tension leg
platform (TLP) yet installed, with 40 well slots, and a large, 20-well slot,
remote subsea production system. Wells drilled from the TLP went on
production in August 1992, more than a month ahead of schedule and
under the original budget.
     The field, whose oil-bearing sandstone reservoir layers are found in two
formations (Statfjord and Lunde, averaging 7,500'-8,500' below the ocean
bottom), with pay ranging from nearly 2,790' to 330' in thickness, will be
developed in two stages. The operations in Phase 1 will account for all the
recoverable reserves in the Statfjord formation and some 30% of the
estimated recoverable reserves from the Lunde formation. The decision on
Phase 2 development will be based on experience with Phase 1 production
but likely will involve either relocation of the TLP to the northern part of
the field or installation of two new subsea production systems.
     Tests of wells drilled from the TLP to the Lunde formation have proven
Snorre to be richer than first believed. Based on this, the field's life
expectancy has been extended beyond 2015. Snorre production is about
120,000 b/d currently.
     Oil and gas production is partially processed on the Snorre TLP and
then exported in two 17-mile pipelines to the Statfjord A platform, where
the final processing takes place. The processed oil is then loaded into
tankers through the Statfjord buoy loading system, while the gas is
transported to shore through a Statpipe system.
     However, field output from Snorre likely will not be increased for some
time since the Statfjord platform can handle only 140,000 b/d from Snorre.
     Production from the Snorre reservoirs requires a concept calling for
nearly 100 wells, half of which will be used for water injection and natural
gas reinjection.
     The Snorre subsea production system is the world's largest.  The
system's wells are drilled from a floating drilling unit. The system has a
double set of well slots (10 x 10). The inner row of wells is intended to be
drilled first. They will come on stream one by one. The system's manifold
design allows each well slot to be used for either production or injection
purposes. The 10 outer wells become operational when the inner wells
have ceased production and have been plugged. The 10 x 10 arrangement
allows the manifold and control system, as well as all pipelines and subsea
trees, to be used twice, helping to cut costs beyond those for drilling and
completion.
     Large amounts of electricity are required on the TLP for drilling
operations, water injection and processing. The platform has its own
power station consisting of four gas-powered generators giving a total
capacity of 60 MW.
     Water, pumped into the reservoir to raise formation pressure and
thereby increase production, is pumped from the sea and filtered in the
TLP's water injection system before it reaches the reservoir.
     In addition to 20 wells drilled for oil production, 40 wells will be
drilled from the Snorre TLP, most of the remaining well slots being used
for injection wells.
     To ensure optimum exploitation of the reservoir, the wells will be
drilled horizontally away from both the TLP and the subsea production
system. On the average, wells will be drilled some 1.5 miles below the
seabed, and their horizontal distance from the platform may be as much as
2.5 miles. Total measured depth of wells could reach nearly four miles.

DOE funds seven reservoir projects

     DOE hopes a new initiative will result in more effective production
methods that could keep many aged U.S. oil fields in operation,
particularly for independent producers.
     Under the initiative, DOE has made more than $5 million available to
six leading petroleum-oriented universities and one state geological survey
to help develop more accurate methods for depicting the geological
makeup of oil and gas reservoirs.
     The seven projects were selected during DOE's 1993 petroleum
geoscience competition. Some 63 proposals were received in response to a
DOE solicitation issued last October.
     In total, the seven projects will cost more than $8 million, with the
additional $3 million to be funded by the winning teams. In most cases,
says DOE, the sponsors will team with major and independent producers,
service companies and oilfield consultants to carry out the work.
     All of the projects will apply advanced geoscience and reservoir
engineering concepts to provide operators with a better picture of a
reservoir's characteristics. In some cases, says DOE, the projects will result
in smaller independent producers having access to new and sophisticated
techniques that have been available to and used by major producers but
have not yet trickled down to the independent sector.
     The selected projects, whose quoted costs are estimates and may
change during negotiations, will take place during a three-year period, and
work will be monitored by DOE's Bartlesville, Okla., Project Office.
     The seven selected projects -- with contacts for companies interested in
participating -- are:

-- Proposer: University of Tulsa (contact B.G. Kelker, phone 918-631-
3036). Total estimated cost: $979,000. Private cost share: 22%.
     ** Geoscience/Engineering Characterization of the Inter-Well
Environment in Carbonate Reservoirs Based on Outcrop Analysis --

IPAA reports drilling cost uptick in 1992

     The Independent Petroleum Assn. of America says domestic oil and gas
wells are getting deeper, and operators are returning to existing wells with
improved recovery technology.
     Yet, in 1992, this trend failed to reflect in higher drilling costs. To the
contrary, the IPAA report observes that the average cost-per-well last year
exhibited a decline of nearly 4%.
     The report adds that much of this decline was precipitated by heavy
discounting by service and supply companies .
     Overall, however, the cost of drilling and completing domestic wells
last year increased by slightly more than 1% from 1991, because wells on
average are deeper than ever.
     Scott Espenshade, who prepared the report, says record low drilling in
1992 forced service and supply companies to offer discounts in order to
get more business. He added that the industry should expect to see such
deep discounts through the remainder of 1993.
     He said an estimate of an average dollar amount for drilling costs
would not prove valid, since the cost varies greatly from well to well.
Instead, the report uses 1989 data to provide a median for comparison for
the 1992 figures.
     Since 1989, the report observes, the cost-per-foot drilling average has
fallen by more than 6% and the cost per well has risen almost 2%. This
should be good news to independents, it adds, since the per-well rise is
modest while wells continue to be drilled deeper.
     Since 1989, U.S. well depth has increased an average of 12%,
Espenshade writes. One cause of this, he adds, is that producers are
looking at deeper pay zones. Also, they are going back to old wells with
improved recovery technology.
     Purchased items accounted for 69% of the cost of drilling and
equipping wells in 1992. And the remaining 31% involved payments to
drilling contractors. This portion of the drilling cost has fallen by about
20% from 1990 levels, IPAA notes. The decline was anticipated because
the industry's average rig count for 1992 -- 721 -- was an all-time low.
     Although overall drilling costs have increased slightly so far in 1993,
says Gene Ames, IPAA chairman, "there is no better time to drill for
natural gas and oil here at home with drilling costs down and the use of
advanced technology on the upswing."
     The drilling cost report will be published quarterly, says Espenshade.
He says he hopes the quarterly report will be beneficial to independents.
Instead of basing their findings on information gathered on a "typical"
U.S. well, he noted, future reports will be broken down by region to reflect
the differences between drilling areas.
     Producers also can take heart from a report just released by Houston-
based Baker Hughes Inc., which estimated the average rig count for 1993
will be about 760 working units.

Two Kern fields revise reserves downward

     Downward additions outnumber by a margin of 2-to-1 upward
additions to estimated reserves in four of California's Kern County oil
fields, where improved recovery projects play a role in production.
     The state Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources Div. in its annual look at
how much recoverable oil is left in the state's fields singles out the Cymric
and Yowlumne fields for upward revisions totaling 24 million barrels;
however, the gains are not enough to make up for downward revisions
totaling 55 million barrels in the McKittrick and Poso Creek fields.
     The Cymric field's Reef Ridge-Antelope pool in the Welport area of the
field is credited with addition of 15.2 million barrels, boosting estimated
reserves to 78.7 million barrels as of the first of this year. Cumulative
production is 191.4 million barrels. Production last year averaged 2,000
b/d. In January, production from 82 wells was 2,750 b/d. Steam plays an
important role here, with Chevron Corp. injecting about 7,000 b/d in cyclic
steaming of some 50 wells.
     The Yowlumne field's Stevens pay picked up 8.8 million barrels,
boosting estimated reserves to 19.1 million barrels. Cumulative production
is 95.9 million barrels. Fifty-six Stevens wells were on line in January,
producing 6,720 b/d. Waterflooding plays an important role at Yowlumne.
Arco Oil & Gas Co., the field operator, puts away 40,000 b/d in 29
injection wells.
     On the debit side, the main area of the McKittrick field was
downgraded 34.5 million barrels, reducing estimated reserves to 4.2
million barrels. In January, 350 wells produced 2,900 b/d. Steamflooding
has been reduced to a minor role in the field, which was on production as
early as 1896 with actual discovery date unknown. In January, only four
injectors were active, with steam injection at a rate of 511 b/d. One
hundred nineteen injection wells were shut in.
     The Poso Creek field, a 1920 discovery, took hits in the Premier area,
where reserves dropped 15.5 million barrels, reducing year-end estimated
reserves to 2 million barrels; and the McVan area, where the drop was 5
million barrels, leaving estimated reserves of 300,000 barrels. Cumulative
production from Premier is 72.5 million barrels. In January, 62 wells
produced 300 b/d. Steamflooding was down to 12 injectors and a rate of
540 b/d with 10 injection wells shut in. At McVan, cumulative production
is 7.2 million barrels. In January, 53 wells produced 146 b/d. Five
steamflood injection wells were shut in.

'92 Okla. oil yield down; gas up slightly

     Oil production in Oklahoma during 1992 declined 5.6% from 1991
totals, while natural gas production increased by 1.4%, says a recent report
from the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.
     Crude oil and condensate production totaled 101.8 million barrels,
down 6 million barrels from 1991's 107.8 million barrels. Daily average
production was 278,234 barrels, compared with 295,457 b/d in 1991.
     Natural and casinghead gas production last year totaled 1.962 tcf,
compared with 1.935 tcf a year earlier. Daily average production was
5.362 bcf compared with 5.302 bcf/d a year earlier.
     Monthly production figures indicate the decline continued into early
1993, the report notes. For February 1993, oil production totaled 7,006,551
barrels of crude oil and condensate for a daily average of 250,234 barrels.
This was an 8.9% decline from that reported for February 1992.
     Natural gas production also showed a dip for February, with a total of
100.4 bcf, for a daily average of nearly 3.6 bcf. This was a 7.7% decline
from February 1992 figures.
     Oklahoma oil production has declined annually from 1984 production
of 168.6 million barrels. Oil production in 1992 was the state's lowest
since 1919 when production totaled 86.9 million barrels.
     The average price paid for Oklahoma oil in 1992 was $18.99/barrel,
compared with an average price of $19.72 in 1991. The average price for
Oklahoma natural gas was $1.63/mcf, compared with $1.57/mcf a year
earlier.
     Of Oklahoma's 77 counties, 66 produced oil and 69 produced gas in
1992. Five counties produced neither during the year.
     Carter County, in Southcentral Oklahoma, led in oil production with
13.6 million barrels. Latimer County in Southeastern Oklahoma, led in
natural gas production with 212.8 bcf.

     Improving Matrix Acidizing with Nitrogen and Heat In Situ
Generation, by C.N. Khalil and Z. de Almeida of Petroleo Brasiliero SA.
From the 4th SPE, Et Al, Latin American Petroleum Engineering
Conference, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Oct. 14-19, 1990:
     In matrix acidizing operations in sandstone formations, special care
must be taken to prevent the formation of undesirable precipitates
generated by secondary reactions and by cooling of the surrounding
wellbore. The fast and thorough recovery of the spent acid fluid is
desirable. Based on studies conducted at the Petrobras R&D Center, a
chemical process that uses a mixture of saturated solutions of nitrogenated
salts to simultaneously generate nitrogen and heat was applied. The
intercalated cushions of acid fluid and a mixture of the above solutions
results in the in situ generation of nitrogen and heat. The increase in
formation temperature associated with the generation of gas increases the
radial penetration of the acid fluid, at the same time prevents the formation
of insoluble compounds and water blockage, and in general  eases the
recovery of the spent fluid (Abstract No. 545283).

New IOR patents

     S.F. Chien, C.L. Redus and P.L. Sigwardt of Texaco Development
Corp. have patented a method of determining flowline steam quality which
uses flow restriction devices with water addition at a known rate between
restrictions. Another object of the invention is to provide for certain field
applications where high-quality steam is mixed with water to achieve a
specific low-quality steam. In such case, the quality of the resulting low-
quality steam may be accurately determined (Canadian Patent No.
1,301,481).
     W.J. Clarke of Geochemical Corp. has patented a method of grouting
porous gas- and petroleum-bearing formations with a cementitious
material comprising ultra-fine ground slag that is useful for primary and
remedial cementing of a wellbore. A composition is provided which
comprises water, a dispersant, slag and an accelerator to activate the slag
(U.S. Patent No. 5,106,423).
     P.I. Day of Union Oil Co. of California has patented a method used for
determining true in situ resistivity of a thin layer within a formation from
dual induction log data. The method first corrects resistivity data read from
the dual induction log. A representative shoulder bed resistivity is first
determined from average deep resistivity data near the shoulder bed. A
paired estimate of layer resistivity and thickness is then computed based
on the determined shoulder bed resistivity, dip angle, and both deep and
medium resistivity data related to the thin bed. The method does not
require thickness data to be input, and in fact, outputs this information, if
needed (U.S. Patent No. 5,142,472).
     W. Sneed has patented a wireline delivery tool for an underground well
having a pipe, a surface seal for the pipe, and a wireline extending from
the surface into the pipe. The wireline delivery tool includes a body,
having a diameter of less than the interior diameter of the pipe, and a cup
extending from the body to create a seal with the interior of the pipe. A
longitudinal bore within at least a portion of the body has a port through
the body on each side of the cup, so that the ports are in communication
with the interior of the pipe. A pressure valve within the bore normally is
in the closed position. Pressure supplied into the pipe between the surface
seal and the cup will move the delivery tool within the pipe (U.S. Patent
No. 5,180,009).

Texas extends IOR incentives

     Texas Gov. Ann Richards signed into law a bill (S.B. 466) that extends
by four years the opportunity for operators to qualify for existing tax
incentives for new and expanded IOR projects.
     The bill extends the 50% severance tax break for IOR projects through
1998 on projects begun on or after Jan. 1, 1994. The credit will be
available after Jan. 1, 1996.
     Richards praised the measure's incentives. "The estimates I've seen for
the additional recovery of Texas oil surpass 650 million barrels for the
period extending to 1998," Richards said.
     The benefits of the legislation include additional investment in oil
production infrastructure and greater operating efficiency due to the longer
operational life of projects subject to the tax credit, she said.
     State Sen. Bill Sims, D-San Angelo, the bill's sponsor, said the bill was
"the single most important piece of legislation to help the oil and gas
industry passed in the 73rd Texas legislative session."

     Pogo Producing Co. is developing a 21-year-old oil and gas field in the
Gulf of Mexico, adding additional proven reserves with the aid of
horizontal drilling technology.
     Pogo, as operator, recently completed two wells in the Eugene Island
Block 330 field, one of which was the first horizontal well to be drilled in
the field's prolific reservoir.
     Pogo Chairman Paul Van Wagenen said first results from the horizontal
well, the C-7ST Well No. 2, indicated 535' of net pay section from two
lobes of the GA-2 horizon. The well was drilled from Platform C, one of
several fixed drilling/production platforms in the field.
     Due to the successful completion of the horizontal well, an additional
assignment of proven reserves in the field is anticipated, Van Wagenen
said.
     The horizontal well followed by about a week successful completion of
a conventional development well, the C-10ST No. 2, which is now
producing at a rate of 710 b/d of oil on a 20/64" choke, with flowing
tubing pressure of 620 psi. That well encountered 80' of net oil sand and is
producing from the HB sand horizons.
     Pogo, with 35% working interest, is the largest owner in the field,
which was discovered in 1972 and already has produced more than 600
bcf of gas and more than 100 million barrels of oil.
     Van Wagenen said Pogo's approved $60 million 1993 capital
expenditures budget includes a minimum of four development wells and
two recompletions in this very prolific block. The group expects to begin
drilling the third development well within a few weeks, following up with
further drilling and workover activity during the remainder of the year.

Pa. coalgas plans on tap

     The Independent Oil & Gas Assn. of Pennsylvania will participate in a
discussion June 25 of issues and potential directions for development of a
comprehensive coalbed methane program for that state.
     The state Environmental Resources Dept. will meet with IOGA and
representatives of other associations in Harrisburg.
     The meeting was called in response to a published notice regarding a
section of the federal Energy Policy Act of 1992, which includes
Pennsylvania on a list of affected states with large coal reserves.
     IOGA says ownership, access and discharge issues will be discussed at
the meeting.
     For more information, phone Barry Cosey, IOGA executive director, at
717-232-0137; fax 717-232-3035.

Imperial revs up heavy oil output

     Imperial Oil Ltd., Calgary, Alberta, is working to find ways to speed
heavy oil production at its Cold Lake project.
     A company senior vice president, Douglas Baldwin, said the company
will bring phases 7 and 8 of its Cold Lake program onstream later this
year, and the company is investigating ways to accelerate phases 9 and 10,
with steam injection scheduled to begin by mid-1994, adding 25,000 b/d to
production. That will bring total Cold Lake production to about 125,000
b/d, he added.
     Once completed, the four-phase expansion will have cost about C$100
million, Baldwin said.
     He said boilers and central processing facilities needed for the
expansion are in place, with the drilling of injection wells and producing
wells remaining to be completed.
     Drilling in Western Canada is at an all-time high, with shortages of
drilling equipment developing in some areas.

Horizontal scores in Sask.

     Incentives offered by Western Canadian provincial governments to
operators that drill horizontal wells or re-complete horizontally in vertical
wells are keeping the number of such wells high in recent months.
     An example is Petrolantic Ltd., which announced last week it had
completed a horizontal producer in the Battle Creek field in Western
Saskatchewan.
     The well, No. 2-27-3-26 W3M, was drilled to 6,750' total depth  and
cut 1,886' of the Shaunovan formation pay with the horizontal section.
Petrolantic described the main pay zone, some 915' in length, as excellent
oil-saturated, porous (18%-24% porosity) and permeable rock.
     Completed open hole, the well tested at rates of 150-260 b/d. It was
equipped with pumps and rods and is producing into on-site production
tanks.
     The well will be flow-lined to the battery to test production rates at full
capacity, the company said, adding it expects this rate to reach about 500
b/d. It is anticipated that the oil cut will stabilize at the 60% range.
Maximum projected flow rates achievable with existing facilities and
equipment is 800 b/d of fluid, the company added.
     If four-month production results meet projections, up to two additional
horizontal wells may be drilled in the Battle Creek area prior to year-end,
the company said.
     Petrolantic, with headquarters in Calgary, Alberta, says it holds a
32.4% before-payout interest and a 29.3% after-payout interest in the
Battle Creek project. Laval, Quebec-based Granisko Resources Inc. holds
a 29% working interest.
