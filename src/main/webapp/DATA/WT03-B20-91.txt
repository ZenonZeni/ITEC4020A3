<H1>Second Stage of Radionuclides Release.</H1>
<HR>
     At the second stage, from 26 April till 2 May(<A HREF = "rstages.gif">picture of release</A>), the  power  of 
the release fell, obviously because of the measures undertaken for 
extinguishing of burning graphite, and formation of the filtrating 
layer. The dependence of the  release  power  on  time  <B>Q(t)</B> 
at this stage can be presented in the  first  approximation 
as 
<P> 
<B>   Q(t) = 0.25.exp(-0.28.t), day  ,             (1)</B> 
<P> 
where <B>0.25</B>, <B>day</B>  , is the part of the total release  corresponding 
to the first day; <B>t</B>, <B>days</B>, is the time after the explosion. 
<P> 
     At  this  stage  the  release  consisted  of   fine-dispersed 
particles of fuel dust entrained by the flow of  hot  air  and  of 
graphite burning products. The <A HREF = "coreinv.html">radionuclide  composition  is  also 
close to the fuel one</A>.
