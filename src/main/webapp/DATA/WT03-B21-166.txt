<P>TVX GOLD BOARD APPROVES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PACHICUTZA MINE IN ECUADOR

<P>Toronto, Ontario, January 15, 1996 ... TVX announced today that it has completed a successful exploration program encompassing 21,400 metres of drilling and the sampling of 8,100 metres of drifts on its high grade zone of the Pachicutza project in Ecuador, with the following results:
<PRE>
GEOLOGICAL RESERVES

                      Dry metric      Au     Ag       Au   Au Equiv   Zn     Pb
                     tonnes (dmt)   (g/t)  (g/t)  ounces     ounces   (%)    (%)
Proven and Probable      657,600    13.6   79.0	 287,400             4.3    0.7
Possible Reserves        300,000    12.3   71.5  118,700             4.7   0.44
Total                    957,600    13.2  76.60	 406,000    436,800  4.4    0.6
</PRE>

<P>Based on these results, the Board of Directors of TVX approved the next phase of the project which is the construction of a development adit to intersect the mineral structure at the bottom level of the outline reserves. In accordance with the feasibility study already prepared by TVX personnel, these reserves will allow an annual throughput of 180,000 tonnes and will produce at an estimated annual rate of 58,500 ounces of gold equivalent (55,400 ounces of gold; 234,000 ounces of silver) and a Zn - Pb concentrate which will be treated as a by-product. Cash costs are anticipated to be below US$200 per ounce of gold equivalent.

<P>The capital cost before production start-up is expected to be approximately US$30 million and the period of construction is targeted to be 18 months. The life expectancy of the mine, based on known reserves, is approximately six years.

<P>The recently acquired Novo Astro plant, mining equipment and plant power generator, which will be refurbished in Ecuador, has been dismantled and will be prepared for shipment for use on the project.

<P>An underground mine will be developed using the cut and fill method and a plant of 500 tonnes per day will be erected. The mill process to be employed involves crushing, milling, gravimetric concentration and a flotation circuit with a gold recovery rate estimated at 94%.

<P>The mineralization occurs as veins and breccias placed in an intrusive volcanic complex of Cretaceous age, which intrude a granite of probably Paleozoic age. These rocks have been faulted heavily which allowed the development of important vein and breccia systems. The veins, with a general strike of N20'W and deeping 750E to 600W, are located in an area of 1,500 x 600 metres. Their horizontal development has been known by the work of informal miners and their extent in depth has been established by an intensive drilling campaign to an average depth of 300 metres. They have an average width of 0.70 metres. The mineralization consists of pyrite and sphaterite with minor quantities of galena, chalcopyrite and a gangue of rodocrocite. The gold is associated principally with pyrite/sphalerite and may be found as free gold.

<P>Exploration work done to date indicates reserves are open laterally and at depth and the Company remains confident that further exploration work could delineate additional reserves.
