Affordable and environmentally clean energy sources are essential to the economic growth of developing and
industrialized countries alike. Reliance on current energy systems, primarily based on fossil fuels, contributes to a wide
range of environmental risks and damages. As a result, simple continuation of current trends in energy production and
consumption is unsustainable.

<FONT SIZE=6> Global climate change  </FONT><BR>
WRI's CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION research program identifies the steps needed to realize the transition
to an environmentally sustainable energy regime -- one in which energy services are provided without compromising
human and environmental health and welfare now or in the future.

Among the threats posed by heavy reliance on fossil fuels, global climate change is perhaps the most serious. Not only
is it hard to see and easy to ignore, but finding solutions poses daunting technical, economic, and political challenges.
WRI was one of the first organizations to make global climate change a primary focus of its research. Working with
scientists, economists, and engineers from many institutions, the interdisciplinary staff of the CLIMATE, ENERGY,
AND POLLUTION Program makes available to governments and non-governmental organizations around the world
the best, most reliable information and analyses of the risks and options associated with climate change.

<DD>Anticipating the major problems that will be encountered in reducing greenhouse gas emissions after the year 2000,
WRI's work focuses on long- term trends and their implications for today's policy choices. Our work on energy policy
is guided by two key realizations. The first is that efficiency improvements must be complemented by a shift to
renewable sources of energy. Renewables offer by far the best prospect of supplying energy in an environmentally
sustainable manner. The second is that under present conditions the needed energy transition is likely to be too slow to
minimize the risks from climate change. As a result, strong economic incentives, including environmentally honest
energy pricing, are needed.

<DD>Focusing on renewable options, on new transportation technologies (such as a "green car" designed to run on
renewable energy), and on economic incentives to hasten the energy transition, WRI puts considerable emphasis on
providing the "supply side" answers that must go hand-in-hand with demand reduction.

<FONT SIZE=6>U.S. Sustainability Project</FONT><BR>
Charting a global "Sustainable Development" path requires substantial changes not only in energy production and use,
but also in transportation, industry, agriculture, forestry, and other economic sectors. Yet, we lack a vision of what
sustainability would mean in the United States and how changes in key sectors of the economy may interact. WRI's
Program in CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION has launched an ambitious two-year effort to spotlight the
double-barreled question: "What would a sustainable U.S. look like and how can we speed the transition?" 

<DD>Working with other WRI programs, the Program in CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION is exploring the concept
of sustainability in the United States and investigating its application to several major economic sectors. Building on
in-house research and expertise in other WRI programs, the team will direct an effort to create a vision of a sustainable
America and an understanding of the steps needed to realize this vision. Workshops on sustainability in the United
States will tie in with four sectoral studies that delineate scenarios for a more sustainable future for these sectors and
show how they can be achieved.

<FONT SIZE=6>International Action on Greenhouse Gases</FONT><BR>
Building on its previous studies of energy taxes (and carbon taxes in particular), WRI is now exploring ways to help
ensure that international efforts to reduce greenhouse gases are as cost-effective as possible. In collaboration with the
Program in ECONOMICS AND POPULATION, WRI's CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION Program will
evaluate mechanisms to further the success of the Climate Change Convention, suggesting how to design effective
taxing mechanisms, adjust tax bases in industrialized countries, address the broader international trade implications of
an OECD-wide carbon tax, and design effective international emissions trading strategies and mechanisms for joint
implementation of the Climate Change Convention.

WRI also continues to build bridges between the community of climate scientists and policy-makers and other strategic
audiences. The program is examining the contribution of trace greenhouse gases -- the "fully fluorinated compounds,"
such as perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride (PFCs and SF6) -- and will continue to promote transatlantic
communication and discussion of carbon and energy tax harmonization.

<FONT SIZE=6>The Institutional and Financial Context for an Energy Transformation</FONT><BR>
Too little attention is being paid to the economic and financial incentives needed to induce the major developing
countries to limit the growth in their greenhouse gas emissions after the year 2000. WRI is launching new research on
this topic, based on the premise that a shift in global energy systems toward a more sustainable state will involve a
tremendous capital commitment and a host of institutions at the local, regional, national and international level.
Opportunities for change are created by the emergence of new financial schemes (such as Joint Implementation);
rethinking old institutions (GEF and the World Bank); and the availability of new funds under, for example, the
Climate Change Convention.

<FONT SIZE=6>Deploying Renewable Energy Sources</FONT><BR>
Renewable sources of energy -- such as solar, wind, and biomass -- hold out prospects for energy supplies that are more
secure and environmentally safer than fossil fuels and other alternatives. Building on a 1993 WRI study of policy
reform to promote renewable energy in the United States and a 1994 report on the renewable energy policies of
development assistance institutions, the CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION Program is now undertaking
research in several developing countries to identify policy reforms needed to enhance the role of renewable energy in a
global sustainable energy future. This research highlights the potential benefits of renewable energy use, the barriers
inhibiting such use in developing countries, and the policies needed to scale those barriers.

<FONT SIZE=6>ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF REDUCING EMISSIONS</FONT><BR>
If setting a price tag on the costs of cutting greenhouse gas emissions is difficult, determining the dollar value of the
benefits is even more problematic. The primary benefit of abatement is avoiding the damages associated with global
warming, which include coastal inundation from rising sea levels, disruption of rainfall and therefore water use
patterns, agricultural effects due to heat stress, and ecosystem damage such as loss of biodiversity and habitat
disruption. Other important potential benefits also come from cutting energy-related emissions, however, such as
cleaner air, reduced damage to crops and forests, and less environmental disruption from fossil fuel extraction. These
not only have an economic value but are widely accorded a higher and more urgent priority by many countries and
communities .

<DD>Pricing the damages from additional global warming involves many unknowns, since the actual extent and regional
distribution of the effects are uncertain. Also, although some effects such as property loss or crop damage are
relatively easy to quantify, quantification of damage to environmental amenities such as clean air, functioning
ecosystems, or biodiversity has always been troublesome for economists because these are intangibles not traded in
the market and their value to human welfare has not been quantified. The long-term and uncertain nature of climate
change also complicates the pricing of damages, since many of these damages occur in the future and standard
economic practice involves discounting these to some lesser, present-day value so that they are comparable to benefits
and costs today. The choice of the "discount rate"--the interest rate used to discount the damages--then becomes
crucial in estimating the monetary value of the effects from global warming that future generations will suffer 
.

<DD>Despite these difficulties, a number of studies have tried to price the damages expected from global warming. These
studies generally assume a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration from preindustrial levels,
leading to an average 2.5 degree C warming. Under these conditions, a very limited set of damages has been estimated
at 1 to 1.5 percent of GDP per year in developed countries and 2 to 9 percent of GDP per year in developing
countries, with island nations potentially suffering much higher damages .

<DD>Of course, carbon dioxide concentrations may not stop at a doubling, and warming may continue, in which case
additional damage will occur. In fact, they may rise geometrically as warming proceeds. For example, damages from a
10 degree C rise might reach 6 percent of GDP or more . There is also the risk of a climate catastrophe in which
the global climate regime changes quickly in unforeseen and deleterious ways. In this case, the damage could escalate
rapidly .

<DD>Other benefits--both local and regional--of emissions abatement, including air quality improvements, can be quite
high. For example, one study estimated that the value of air quality benefits in India from freezing emissions at 1990
levels would actually exceed the costs of the freeze. Likewise, studies in Europe and the United States indicate that
such non-climate-related benefits could offset 30 to 100 percent of abatement costs . At least some economists
who have studied the matter believe that taking into account both climate and other benefits of cutting carbon dioxide
and the need to avoid the risk of a climate disaster provide a plausible economic justification for making substantial
investments in emissions abatement.
