<P>
Most American forecasters now accept that U.S. output growth during
the second quarter will be in the 3.5-4.5% range. The strength
of the May data for employment, production and retail sales has
eliminated any doubts about the economy's capacity to recover
from the inventory adjustment which dampened output growth during
much of 1995 and early 1996. The great controversies now center
on whether output growth can be sustained at a rate of 3.0% or
whether it will fade back to the 1.0-2.0% range which prevailed
during much of 1995.
<P>
The majority of forecasters continue to expect a slowdown because
they perceive the business cycle to be mature, the household sector
to be overleveraged, and the business sector to be losing momentum.
They also believe that the large rise in bond yields since January
will depress home sales and residential construction by the autumn.
The optimists believe that the private sector has far more resilience
and that there will be spurt in federal expenditures as government
agencies rush to spend discretionary funds provided by the recent
Congressional-White House budget agreement.
<P>
<B>The case for above trend U.S. growth during the second half
of 1996 has five major pillars.</B> 
<P>
First, consumer spending should benefit from steady growth of
employment, modest upward pressure on wages, buoyant balance sheets,
and the high level of confidence apparent in the household sector.
According to the early June survey of consumer confidence by the
University of Michigan, households are optimistic about both their
financial situation and the general business outlook. Such optimism
is not surprising in view of the recent revisions in the government's
survey of labor market condition. On the basis of the data which
was available before June 7th, the average monthly increase in
employment had been 116,000 for the past three months, 163,000
for the past six months, and 162,000 for the past twelve months.
<B>The new data has revised up the average monthly growth rate
of employment to 223,000 jobs for the past three months, 225,000
jobs for the past six months, and 195,000 jobs for the past twelve
months.</B> The 1995 employment growth rate also was revised up
to 185,000 jobs per month from 144,000 while 1994 was revised
up to 318,000 from 294,000. The wage data look stronger as well.
The three month and twelve month growth rates of wages are now
3.5% and 3.4% compared to 2.8% and 3.3% previously.
<P>
There are risks in the consumer outlook. Fluctuations in auto
discounts could produce large monthly swings in retail spending
on autos. Rising mortgage rates will probably dampen home sales
by the autumn. The sharp rise now occurring in delinquency rates
on credit card loans could ultimately encourage banks to promote
them less aggressively among low income people. But the strength
of employment growth and the uptrend now occurring in wages suggests
that the underlying growth rate trend of consumer spending will
be at least 2.5% during the next few quarters. While the lending
policies of the credit card sector should be monitored carefully,
the major banks report that the rise in delinquency rates will
not deter them from offering new cards to people earning less
that $30,000 per annum. As the bottom 20% of the U.S. population
accounts for only 5-6% of consumer spending, more careful rationing
of credit card access would also not produce a broad based slump
in consumer spending.
<P>
While the major factor boosting consumer confidence is the improved
labor market, it also should benefit from the recovery occurring
in the advertising industry and the real incomes of financial
journalists. Analysts project that domestic advertising outlays
will rise by 7.4% this year compared to nominal GDP growth of
only 5.0-6.0%. Such a healthy advertising environment will improve
the salaries and expense accounts of the business journalists
who influence household psychology through the tone of the news
stories which they write about the economy. When advertising is
in recession, journalists suffer real income losses which encourage
pessimistic news reporting about the economy. When the advertising
sector is prosperous, the real incomes of journalists improve
and thus reinforces the new mood of optimism about the economy.
<P>
The fluctuation in advertising expenditures during the 1990's
have been so large that they have become an important influence
on both the economy and public policy. Newspaper advertising fell
by 6-7% during 1990 -1991 and grew by only 1.0% during 1992. The
only previous contraction was a 0.2% decline in 1970 which was
followed by 8.1% growth during 1971. Television advertising declined
during 1991 for the first time ever in the post war era while
radio advertising declined for the first time since 1961. <B>Forecasters
do not ordinarily focus on advertising expenditures as a proxy
for consumer confidence but the fact is they are highly interdependent.</B>
If an advertising slump depresses the real incomes of the scribbling
classes, it influences the tone of media commentary about business
conditions and economic policy. <B>There also has been a good
correlation during recent years between newspaper advertising
expenditures and election results.</B> George Bush presided over
the greatest advertising recession of the post-war era. Ronald
Reagan won re-election in 1984 on the back of double digit growth
in advertising outlays. Jimmy Carter's defeat in 1980 coincided
with a collapse in the growth rate of advertising outlays to only
6.0-7.0% from 14-15% during the previous four years. Richard Nixon's
victory in 1972 coincided with a double digit spurt in advertising
outlays after two years of decline and slow growth. The Republicans
lost the White House to the Democrats in 1960 against a backdrop
of advertising expenditures slowing from double digit growth rates
in 1959 to only 4.4% during 1960 and a decline of over 2.0% during
1961. The only electoral contest which has run contrary to the
trend of advertising expenditures is the 1976 presidential election,
when Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter despite an upturn in the
growth rate of advertising expenditures to 16.8% from 4.0-5.0%
during the previous two years.
<P>
The second pillar of the above trend growth scenario is the benign
outlook for business investment. Corporate profits should rise
by 10-12% this year. Capacity utilization rates in the manufacturing
sector have risen back to 82.0% from 81.3% in January while utilization
rates for the economy as a whole are at 83.2%. The ratio of stock
prices to asset replacement costs (Tobin's Q) is at the highest
level in post-war history. As result, <B>the corporate sector
is enjoying an unprecedented fund raising boom in the securities
markets. </B>During the first five months of 1996, there were
364 new equity I.P.O's raising $23.7 billion of capital compared
to 573 I.P.O.'s raising $28.9 billion last year and a previous
peak of 665 I.P.O.'s raising $34 billion during 1993. The market
for non-investment grade debt is also enjoying strong growth.
There were 92 non-investment grade bond offerings worth $17 billion
during the first five months of 1996 compared to 159 worth $28.7
billion last year and a peak of 343 worth $54.4 billion during
1993. <B>The bond market is producing less new financing than
the equity market because bond mutual funds are attracting far
less new money than equity mutual funds but the magnitude of non-investment
grade financing in the debt market is still the greatest since
the Drexel Burnham boom of the mid-1980's.</B> 
<P>
The third pillar of the strong growth scenario is that the economy
has recently experienced its greatest inventory adjustment since
the mid-1980's. Further growth of final demand will now require
faster growth of output. Non-farm inventories contracted at an
annul rate of $0.1 billion during the first quarter compared to
growth of $37.4 billion during 1995 and $46.8 billion during 1994.
In April, retail inventories rebounded at a 0.4% monthly rate
but the economy's inventory/sales ratio was still only 1.38 compared
to a peak of 1.41 during the second half of 1995. In the non-auto
retail sector, the I/S ratio was 1.36 compared to 1.39 during
the third quarter of 1995 while in the general merchandise sector
it was 2.23 compared to 2.33 during the fourth quarter of last
year. The weakness of output during the past year in sectors other
than computers and communications equipment suggests that there
could be a broad based upturn in the level of inventory accumulation
worth at least $30 billion during the second half of 1996.
<P>
The fourth pillar of the strong growth scenario is a resurgence
of discretionary federal spending after several months of fiscal
gridlock and temporary government shutdowns during the first two
quarters of the current fiscal year. Recent CBO studies project
that discretionary federal spending during fiscal 1996 will be
worth bout $535 billion. As a result of the government shutdown,
federal spending during the first seven months of the fiscal year
averaged only $510 billion at annual rates. <B>As a result, federal
agencies will have to spend at an annual rate of $570 billion
during the final five months of the fiscal year if they are to
achieve the CBO target.</B> There is no precise way to convert
such spending into the federal government components of the GDP
accounts but the pressure to spend suggests that real federal
expenditures will rise moderately during the third quarter compared
to widespread forecasts that they will decline at a 3.0-4.0% annual
rate. As a result of the recent congressional-White House disagreements
over fiscal policy, federal spending has been very volatile during
the current fiscal year. It fell at a 12.8% annual rate during
the fourth quarter of 1995 and then rebounded at an 8.5% annual
rate during the first quarter of 1996.
<P>
<B>The final pillar of the strong growth scenario is the upturn
now occurring in other G-7 countries, Latin America and China.</B>
If the U.S. economy can achieve 2.5-3.0% output growth this year,
the world economy should enjoy a growth rate in excess of 4.0%
for the first time since 1988. As the cyclical upturns in other
countries are just getting underway, the odds are high that global
output growth will remain above 4.0% next year as well. The recovery
in the world economy will not prevent an inventory induced upsurge
of imports from widening the U.S. trade deficit this summer but
it should cause improvement of the trade account to boost output
growth by at least 0.2-0.3% during 1997.
