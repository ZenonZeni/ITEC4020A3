INTERNET, UNIFIED MESSAGING SEEN EMERGING IN 1996

     Converging technologies will change the business of voice
technology this year, analysts told VTSN when we asked what companies
should expect from the voice industry in 1996.
     No one could talk about the coming year without mentioning the
Internet and how it would affect the voice market.  Private branch
exchanges (PBXs) and telephony servers will merge to create
integrated, do-it-all servers on which enterprises will run mission-
critical networks.  The long predicted emergence of unified messaging
and computer telephony integration (CTI) finally will become a reality
in 1996.

The Internet:  CB Radio or New Paradigm

     Even with all the excitement over the Internet in 1995, there
still are many consultants predicting its imminent demise.
     "It's not clear to me that the Internet is not just [citizen's
band] radio," said Dusty Sykes, a consultant for analyst firm Vanguard
Communications Corp. in Morris Plains, N.J.
     But even if it is a passing trend, companies are spending
considerable time, money and resources crafting Internet strategies
and incorporating the Internet into products.
     "The Internet will be very big this year," said Sheila McGee-
Smith, of the PELORUS Group in Raritan, N.J.  "I think people are
spending a lot of time investigating what kind of presence ... [they]
need to have.  I think we are beyond the point of 'do I need a
presence,' [and now should be asking] 'how do I integrate this into
the back office and how do I make money from this.'  Companies need to
know whether there is money to be made or not."   
     The rush to the Internet has not been all rosy, analysts said,
because many other technologies were ignored in 1995 as companies
clamored for more Internet presence.  One example is fax-on-demand.
     "The same money that might have been budgeted for fax-on-demand
has gone into [World Wide] Web pages," said Peter Davidson, president
of Davidson Consulting in Burbank, Calif.    
     After awhile, the people who are putting money into the Internet
are going to realize it only hits one segment of the marketplace and
they are going to go to fax as well.  [Then] the Internet may create
opportunities for fax-on-demand."  
     In the voice market, Internet activities are particularly visible
in call centers.  Big call center companies, such as Aspect
Communications Corp. of San Jose, Calif., and Rockwell of Downers
Grove, Ill., announced they would be adding technology to their
products that allow callers to access customer service representatives
in call centers by clicking a button on a World Wide Web page.  
     Smaller companies, such as San Jose, Calif.-based Edify Corp.,
also announced software that would perform similar tasks through
software-only, open solutions.  
     McGee-Smith expects to see many more Internet-related
announcements from call center companies and "more focusing on call
center vendors' end-user.  People will need to be able to access call
centers from the Internet."
     The call center market also will continue to grow in 1996, McGee-
Smith said.  "I can't imagine anybody saying ... that [the call center
market] is mature.  That is like saying the personal computer (PC)
market is mature--it is constantly changing."

Combining Telephony and Switches on One Server

     What CTI gurus long have been predicting seems set to come true
in 1996--telephony servers that will run both an enterprise's PBX and
computer-telephony over a single network. 
     "The marketplace is going to recognize that the idea of adding
devices to existing PBXs does not make sense and the market will
recognize that a new paradigm is upon us--new telephony switch servers
that integrate voice, data and communications services," said Jim
Burton, president of C-T Link in Boston.
     AltiGen Communications Inc. in Fremont, Calif., is one company
already causing a buzz over its yet unseen "open multimedia platform
that will offer integrated servers," according to new vice president
of marketing, Gary Andresen, formerly a senior consultant for
Dataquest in San Jose, Calif. 
     Andresen was so impressed by AltiGen's forthcoming platform that
he left Dataquest to get on board with a company that would be
offering what he had been saying eventually would be the enterprise
telephony solution, he told VTSN.  Look for upstart AltiGen to
announce its new platform at the Computer Telephony show in Los
Angeles, March 12-14.
     The type of solution companies such as AltiGen will offer is a
"self-contained unit that has fax, integrated messaging, interactive
voice response, and a switching element so that you have telephone
lines coming in from the central office and telephones serving out of
the box to the desktop.  A web server might also be a part of the
communications, and an automated attendant," Burton said.

Unified Messaging Will Take Hold

     The universal in-box and unified messaging platform are two
technologies all of the big messaging companies--voice and electronic-
-have been pursuing fervently.  Analysts say 1996 will be the year
these offerings become reality.
     "I believe that messaging is the 'killer app' that everyone has
been looking for and it has been sitting in front of us for the past
five years," Vanguard analyst Sykes said. 
     With the need for multimedia messaging driving a technology
convergence, players new to the voice market are changing:  software
heavy-hitters Lotus Development Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Novell
Inc..  
     All three have said they will have next generation client-server
messaging systems coming out in the first half of 1996, and all have
announced or demonstrated plans to include universal in-boxes that
will receive electronic, fax and voice messages.  All three also are
crafting Internet strategies that they are incorporating into these
systems. 
     Release 4.0 of Lotus Notes will become available Jan. 10.  Notes
already offers third-party applications that make it a viable
computer-telephony platform, such as San Diego-based Blue Sky
Technologies' Phone Notes.  However, release 4.0 adds functionality to
Notes while making it simpler to manage and lowering the price. 
Analysts expect the differences to increase Notes popularity, despite
predictions that simpler technologies--such as web browsers--would
dethrone Notes as large enterprise's groupware platform of choice.
     Microsoft has said its Exchange server product would be out some
time in the first quarter of 1996, and many companies have put their
messaging plans on hold until they get a chance to look at what the
Redmond, Wash.-based company is going to offer.  With a large
corporate migration to Windows NT, the company's powerful high-end
operating system, many users will want to use a native Microsoft
messaging solution as well.
     Microsoft also has shown a solid commitment to both computer-
telephony and fax in its products.  Its new operating system, Windows
95, included Microsoft's telephony API (TAPI), Microsoft Fax and a
link to Sprint Corp.'s broadcast fax service in its offering (VTSN,
Aug. 8, 1995,).  
     Novell Netware users are waiting for Novell to release Groupwise
XTD, which finally will make Novell's popular groupware offering into
a client-server messaging architecture.  Groupwise XTD will offer
updated calendaring and scheduling, and Gary Rowe, principal of Rowe
Communications in Atlanta, said Groupwise XTD is "probably the
furthest ahead in the universal mailbox arena."

Fax's Role in Unified Messaging

     The universal mailbox is expected to boost fax's messaging role,
making it both easier and more preferable because of the direct
connection and exact image replication fax offers.
     "Fax is an integral part of the universal mailbox," said Maury
Kauffman, managing partner at The Kauffman Group in Cherry Hill, N.J.
     The proof of this, Kauffman said, is Kirkland, Wash.-based
Applied Voice Technologies' purchase of RightFax of Tucson, Ariz., for
$4.2 million in cash and stock last week.  "This is sending a message
to all the other voice- and E-mail companies that if they don't have a
fax [component], they won't be able to compete."
     Analysts say RightFax leads the market in fax servers, followed
by Optus Software in Somerset, N.J.; they expect the local area
network (LAN)-based fax server market to expand rapidly in 1996.  "In
terms of LAN fax itself, we will see growth rates through the roof,"
Kauffman said.  "There are at least a million Novell networks.  Less
than 10 percent have fax servers on them," Kauffman said.
     The rise of Windows NT also will help the LAN-based fax server
market, consultant Davidson said.  "[Last year] has really been a year
of pilot testing NT-based servers.  1996 will be the year when
commercial sales start to happen in a big way.  What you are going to
have is what was a DOS-based industry become, as much or more so, an
NT-based industry," Davidson said. 

Forming Standards To Meet New Needs

     The introduction of computer software companies that adhere to a
different, more competitive business strategy changed the way voice
companies thought about their own strategies last year.  Once a market
of closed and proprietary technology, the voice industry has been
forced by the encroaching computer software industry to open their
platforms.  
     In response to that need, the Enterprise Computer Telephony Forum
(ECTF) seemed to come from nowhere to become a major industry force in
1995, leaving the other voice standards organization--Versit--
scrambling for position in the rapidly changing voice standards arena.
     "The most important is the formation of the ECTF.  They will get
together and see that we have interoperability--even without Microsoft
and Intel.  There isn't a play for Microsoft and Intel in the ECTF
except to follow what's going on and participate," Burton said.  
     "The Versit community has to be asking themselves whether they
are accomplishing what their goals have been."
     Versit is a four-company standards group composed of AT&T Corp.,
Apple Computer Corp., IBM Corp. and Siemens Rolm.  Each of the
founding Versit companies, along with Novell, joined the ECTF in July
1995.
     Versit worked on its own standard of Novell's open telephony
services application programming interface (TSAPI)--Versit TSAPI.  It
also brought out its encyclopedia of computer-telephony standards, the
Versit Encyclopedia, which is available for anyone to download on
Versit's home page at http://www.versit.com.
     One of the ECTF's goals for this year, according to ECTF
President Tom Zenisek, is to make its own work on Versit TSAPI and the
Versit Encyclopedia its second major project.  In 1996, the ECTF will
release its first body of work:  the telephony application objects
(TAO) specification, which it was given to develop by the Single
Computing System Architecture (SCSA) consortium.  
     The ECTF plans to release the specification at the Computer
Telephony show in March, and have a membership technical and marketing
committee meeting immediately afterwards, on March 15, in Los Angeles.

VOICE TECHNOLOGY INTEGRAL TO RETAIL BANKING SERVICES

     Banks are turning increasingly to voice technology among
solutions to providing 24-hour remote retail banking services.  
     "We believe that eventually this will be the preferred method of
interacting with a bank and there will be appropriate revenue
streams," said Henry Mounger, senior vice president of Deposit
Guaranty National Bank in Jackson, Miss.  "Right now it's (an issue
of) market leadership.  We believe we are laying the groundwork for
what the future of banking delivery will look like. ... It is hard in
the early stages to put a benefit to that."

Working with Visa

     Deposit Guaranty, which has almost $6 billion in assets and
serves Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, is working with Visa
Interactive of San Francisco to provide its customers with remote
banking solutions.  In 1988, the bank installed a virtual response
unit (VRU) from InterVoice of Dallas, to handle requests for account
balances.  In November 1994, Deposit Guaranty offered touch-tone bill
payment, and introduced remote banking by personal computer (PC) in
November 1995, Mounger said.  
     This year, Deposit Guaranty also will begin selling customers
PhonePlus screenphones for approximately $200 to $250 a piece. 
Several bank employees have been trying the screenphones since April,
and Deposit Guaranty plans to select 250 customers to test the system
for free for several months.  Customers will pay an undetermined
monthly fee to use the service.
     Mounger admits the bank is not sure which device or method
customers will prefer--one reason Deposit Guaranty has chosen to
provide its customers with several options.
     "There are lots of mixed reviews on screenphones," Mounger said. 
"We don't want to dictate which device wins [and] we ... have to offer
different options."  Visa buys the screenphones from U.S. Order and
Verifone manufactures the phones which include some intelligence so
users can perform a variety of tasks off-line.  "Visa's strategy is to
  ... support their electronic banking platform by making it compatible
with several screenphones," Mounger said.
     On a systems level, Visa Interactive provides software and
outsourcing services for banks that want to offer remote banking
solutions.  Deposit Guaranty uses Visa to outsource its bill payment
services, which approximately 1,800 customers use.  When a customer
calls in to pay bills, Deposit Guaranty's VRU transfers the customer
to Visa's network, which is linked to Deposit Guaranty's database, and
the funds are transferred then from the customer's account to the
payee. 
     Deposit Guaranty also plans to offer services from the Internet,
although the bank is not yet sure what it will do beyond getting a
home page and World Wide Web site.  "We will be relying on a third
party such as Visa Interactive to get us to that level," Mounger said.
     For its part, Visa is working hard to develop its Internet
applications--last summer it allied with San Francisco-based Worlds
Inc. to develop three-dimensional banking and retailing applications
for the Internet. (Deposit Guaranty National Bank, 601/968-4759; Visa
Interactive, 415/432-2753, http://www.visa.com.)    .DEPARTMENT

EDIFY HELPING BUSINESSES BUILD INTERNAL `INTRANET' SOLUTIONS

     Edify Corp.'s agent software for the World Wide Web is making an
impact on both the user and investor community.  Unisys Corp. last
month purchased Electronic Workforce 4.0 to provide a self-service
human resource application to its 36,000 employees worldwide. 
Employees will access this information through the "Intranet," or
internal World Wide Web, that Unisys' human resources department is
building.  Telephone and fax access soon will be added to the system.
     Wall Street also has taken notice of Edify:  Goldman Sachs & Co.,
of New York City, led an investment group that purchased a $7.4
million minority stake in the company.  Among the investors was
Michael Dell, founder and chief executive of Dell Computer Corp.
     The Edify program will give Unisys employees secure and
controlled access to their human resource records, including benefits
and available leave information, through the Intranet.  Electronic
Workforce 4.0 also will work with PeopleSoft's Human Resource
Management System (HRMS) to allow employees to update records either
over the Web or via telephone.   
     Bluebell, Pa.-based Unisys believes it can control human resource
personnel costs by letting employees make their own changes to certain
personal information, according to Lee Stivale, information technology
project director for human resource systems at Unisys.  
     Unisys also wants to use Electronic Workforce to give its
international employees continuous access to each other.  The
Electronic Workforce integrates such devices and communications
methods as telephones, fax and E-mail with the World Wide Web.

OCTEL BEEFS UP MESSAGING SOFTWARE TO UNITE DISPARATE PLATFORMS  

     Milpitas, Calif.-based Octel Communications Corp. released
version 1.1 of its Aria messaging software specifically for Overture
250 and 350 message servers.  It also runs on Aspen, Branch, Maxum and
XC1000 servers.  Octel says customers can migrate to Aria 1.1 without
losing existing data or having to change equipment.  Users can convert
Octel's systems to an Octel Overture 250 or 350 message system using
Aria 1.1.  The software adds back-up and restore features to the Aria
platform and a Global Message Redundancy option that keeps servers up
and running even if one part of the system fails.  The software is
available immediately in the U.S. and in early 1996 in Great Britain
and Ireland.  (Octel, 408/321-2000.)

FCC DISCUSSING LEVYING TAX ON ISPS TO ENSURE UNIVERSAL SERVICE

       The bold Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering
levying a tax on Internet Service Providers (ISPs) because of the
growth of certain technologies, specifically Internet phone software,
that is allowing the Internet to be used in lieu of the phone
companies, bypassing access fees.  The FCC is concerned that by taking
this revenue from local phone companies, phone service for hard-to-
reach rural areas will increase.  A Notice of Proposed Rule Making may
be issued sometime this year, sources said.  The Commission is
considering levying either a flat tax or basing it on an accounting
system that would make ISPs account for all the traffic they send
through the local exchange and then pay a fee based on that traffic. 
ISPs would then choose whether to pass those savings on to users.

NEC RELEASES CTI APPLICATION FOR ITS PBX SYSTEMS

       NEC America Inc., of Irving, Texas, entered the race to provide
computer-telephony integration (CTI) solutions.  NEC announced Desktop
Receptionist, a Windows-based application for both its private branch
exchange (PBX) systems--NEAX 2400 ICS and the NEAX 2000 IVS.  The
software uses Microsoft's Telephony Application Programming Interface
(TAPI) to make, answer and transfer phone calls using a personal
computer instead of a telephone.  The software also can set up
conference calls, send out pages, transfer voice messages and search
directories.  On the administration side, Desktop Receptionist has
password-accessible security and a reporting application that allows
managers to track incoming call activity, call status and call type. 
The application can be used as a primary answering system, automated
receptionist or a backup answering service. (NEC America Inc.,

INTERVOICE GRANTED PATENT FOR `APPLET' ARCHITECTURE

     Dallas-based InterVoice Inc. is using a hot, new idea in the
Internet community to run advanced intelligent networks (AINs).  It's
making "mini-applications" available for its platforms by placing them
on intelligent peripherals (IPs) over AIN architectures.  The result
is a smarter system that makes use more evenly of system resources.  
     InterVoice has been issued U.S. patent number 5,469,500 for its
technology, which distributes an AIN application's intelligence into
subscripts, once called "applets" and now referred to as service
application modules (SAMs).  SAMs run on an IP instead of leaving the
intelligence on a service control point (SCP), which often handles
such tasks as network database management.  
     "A SAM would be something such as voice mail, voice-activated
dialing, single number service, or automated service activation," said
Al Samball, manager of new business development.  "The modules all can
be tied together."  
     This requires the SCP to exert a lower level of control over the
IP, said Mike Polcyn, InterVoice's vice president of business
development and product marketing. 

Taking the Pressure Off

     Transferring some of the network intelligence and tasks to IPs
takes the pressure off SCPs, much like using an Internet applet means
that the user can avoid taking up personal computer memory storing
applications and instead run the program straight off a remote server.
     "An IP is typically performing very primitive functions," said
Polcyn.  "Play a particular message, collect digits, and so on.  When
you get into a complex application like voice-activated dialing that
has a couple of layers of user dialogue, user input or information
access, the overhead on the SCP of dealing with that complexity in a
very large port configuration would be somewhat overwhelming in terms
of processor requirements."  
     "If you were to break that application into pieces that could be
delegated to the IP, it could perform a lot of those functions
autonomously and then return to the SCP the result of that
processing," he added.
     Polcyn said InterVoice would incorporate this technology into its
own products.  He would not disclose whether the company plans to
license the technology to other vendors. 
     InterVoice also announced that it has joined Texas-based Tandem
Computers Inc.'s Tandem Alliance Program.  The program develops
connections between Tandem's platforms and software from allied
vendors to provide integrated solutions for customers.  Initially,
Intervoice said it will offer voice-activated dialing, single-number
follow-me services, an automated assistant, and voice navigation and
voice mail applications.  (InterVoice, 214/454-8834; Tandem, 214/516-
6484.)
