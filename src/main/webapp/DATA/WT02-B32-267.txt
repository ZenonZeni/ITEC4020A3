January/February 1997, <I>"Monitoring the Media"</I> by Judith Mandelbaum.<BR>
<P>
"...NewsFlash from NewsNet is an excellent way to monitor breaking news for
coverage of products and companies, since NewsFlash constantly matches your tracking profiles against more than 17,000 articles that enter the service each day.<P>
NewsNet and NewsFlash have over 800 sources that include real-time, worldwide newswires, and many daily newsletters and papers. There is no limit to the number of NewsFlash topics you can monitor and the menu-driven software allows more options for customizing your profile than any other system. For instance, you can specify activation and expiration dates, ask the system to search only certain segments (full text or headlines), or sort your results. You can track against a single source, any combination of sources, or everything added to the system.<P>
When your profile is active, NewsFlash notifies you at sign-on with the name of the folder and the number of new articles. You can scan a list of new headlines and decide to view results in full, KWIC, or preview formats (the first 18-24 lines). Once you've looked at the articles, you can either delete or save them..."<P>

Sept/Oct 1996, <i>"All the News and Nothing But the News"</i> by Reva Basch.<br><p>
"...NewsNet, another professional-grade search service with a strong collection
of timely news sources, excels in the update arena with an electronic 
clipping service called NewsFlash..."<P>


<img height=9 width=9 src="Bulletsh/ltblubal.gif"> <b>Internet World</b> August 1996, <i>"Business Without Browsers"</i> 
by Larry Krumenaker. <br><p>

"...NewsNet has long been an industry player serving up searchable databases 
of industry newsletters, but it only reached the Internet in 1996. 
Newsletters often report trends and facts long before they hit the consumer 
press. This is news for insiders. NewsNet is particulary strong in the electronics and computer industry and in the fields of energy, environment, 
financial, international, publishing, broadcasting and telecommunications.  
The service also boasts an impressive array of real-time yet searchable wire 
services (foreign and domestic), plus gateways to Dun & Bradstreet, 
Standard & Poor's, and TRW Services."<P>

"...At the pace at which online services are growing and improving, describing
 any of these systems has been a challenge. I appreciate the help of each 
service's customer support department in keeping me updated on the system 
changes. I particularly would like to thank Maria Pastino, NewsNet Senior
Customer Support Representative, one of the most responsive, knowledgeable, 
and friendly user support people I have ever met..."</font><p>
