CRYPTO CHIP DEBUTS iPower (note self destruct .. djf) <p>

&gt;&gt;From the News Briefs in Dr. Dobb's Developer Update, March 1994:
&gt;
&gt;CRYPTO CHIP DEBUTS
&gt;
&gt;National Semiconductor has released the iPower encryption chip,
&gt;which is designed for use in PCMCIA cards and provides a range
&gt;of security features. The chip can encrypt data via multiple
&gt;encryption algorithms, and will self-destruct upon any
&gt;tampering attempt, using a self-contained chemical. Cards that
&gt;use the iPower chip can also provide additional functions such
&gt;as tracking user access times. The iPower division is based [in]
&gt;Santa Clara, CA 408-721-8797.
