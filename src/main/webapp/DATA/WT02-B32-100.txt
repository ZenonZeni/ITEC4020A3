<H1>Enzymatic Synthesis of Oligosaccharides</H1>
</font>
<P> One of the principle interests of the group is the development of useful synthesis technology based upon glycosidases. Whilst these enzymes are useful catalysts for the preparation of novel and bioactive oligosaccharides, they are not without problems. In order for them to become useful catalysts, problems of regioselectivity and yield must be addressed.
</ul>

<ul>
We currently have two projects under way attempting to address these problems:
<P>
<P><h2>Development of efficient reactors for the synthesis of derivatives and analogues of trehalose and sucrose.</h2>
<P>
<P>This BBSRC funded project is being carried out by Nigel Smith who is developing enzyme reactors to perform equilibrium synthesis of oligosaccharides. One advantage of using glycosidases is that, whilst the equilibrium yield may not be high, the unused substrates can be separated and reutilised. The synthetic reactions have been optimised and various reactor configurations are now being investigated.
<P>
<P>
<h2>Specificity and selectivity in glycosidase-catalysed synthesis reactions</h2>
<P>
<P>This investigation is evaluating the use of linkage-specific glycosidases to produce oligosaccharides with high regioselectivity. Early results with a specific alpha-mannosidase have been encouraging. Studies are now continuing with specific fucosidases and galactosidases. This project is funded by the Asian Development Bank in association with the British Council and is being carried out by Sony Suwasono.
