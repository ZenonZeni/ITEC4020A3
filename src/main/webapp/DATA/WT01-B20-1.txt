<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Federal Judge Speaks Out
Against Drug War</b></font><b> <br>
Endorses Program To Stop Arresting Marijuana Consumers</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 25, 1996, Waterville, ME:</b>&nbsp; A
high-ranking federal judge criticized America's current anti-drug
efforts while speaking before students at Colby College, reported <i>The
Associated Press</i>.&nbsp; Calling our drug war strategies a &quot;losing
battle,&quot; Chief Judge Juan Torruella of the First Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals proposed that America seriously rethink its
methods and goals, and suggested that the establishment of a
national pilot program to alleviate marijuana-related
prosecutions might be a first step in the right direction. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">At minimum, &quot;a shift has to be made in the funding for drug
enforcement toward an intense educational campaign,&quot; he
said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella, who went on the federal bench in 1975 and joined the
appeals court in 1984, called for a national debate on the drug
issue.&nbsp; In addition, he said that an independent national commission
should be empaneled to analyze alternative approaches to curbing
drug use.&nbsp; Currently, any legitimate debate on the issue is
clouded by political &quot;rhetoric&quot; and anti-drug &quot;hysteria,&quot;
he claimed.&nbsp; Torruella likened this attitude to the zealotry
exhibited by anti-communists during the McCarthy era. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella was also critical of the ways in which he felt drug
prosecutors and law enforcement officials have run rampant over
the bill of rights.&nbsp; &quot;You can't have one Constitution
for the good guys and another Constitution for the bad
guys,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Torruella has served as chief judge of the First Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals since 1994.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Federal Medical Marijuana Bill Attracts
Additional Sponsors</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; Three more
members of Congress, including one Republican and the House's
only Independent, have recently signed on to a federal bill (H.R.
2618) that would permit physicians to prescribe marijuana as a
therapeutic agent for seriously ill patients.&nbsp; With the addition
of the recent signees, U.S. Reps. Bernard Sanders (I-VT), George
Brown (D-Calif.), and Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), the total number
of co-sponsors now stands at sixteen. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Slowly but surely, more and more members of Congress are
coming forward to show their support for medical marijuana
legislation,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;This is a bill that deserves full bi-partisan
support and prompt federal action.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The inclusion of Bilbray brings the total number of Republican
co-sponsors to three.&nbsp; Republican support of this
legislation is critical if the bill is to move forward in a
Republican controlled Congress. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, H.R. 2618 is simultaneously pending before two
subcommittees: the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on
Crime and the House Commerce Committee, Subcommittee on Health
and Environment.&nbsp; This past March, <b>NORML</b> Executive
Director Keith Stroup, Esq. testified before the Subcommittee on
Crime and encouraged Chairman Bill McCullom (R-Fla.) -- a former
two-time co-sponsor of federal medical marijuana legislation
himself -- to hold additional hearings regarding medical
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">H.R. 2618 was introduced in Congress last fall by Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) to amend federal law to allow seriously ill
patients to have legal access to marijuana for medicinal
purposes.&nbsp; If passed, the bill would allow doctors to
prescribe marijuana to individuals suffering from &quot;glaucoma,
AIDS wasting syndrome, muscle spasms from certain spastic
disorders including multiple sclerosis, paraplegia, and
quadriplegia, or the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy
or radiology.&quot;&nbsp; Presently, only eight patients are
allowed to receive marijuana legally from the federal government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The effectiveness of medicinal marijuana has been endorsed by a
number of scientific and medical associations including the <a
href="../../MEDICAL/apha.html">American Public Health Association</a>,
the Australian Commonwealth Department of Human Services and
Health, the National Academy of Sciences, and the <a
href="../../MEDICAL/POT/nnsaposi.html">National Nurses Society on
Addiction</a>. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Navajo Hemp Crop Under Fire From Feds</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1, 1996, Navajo Nation, AZ:</b>&nbsp;
Plans for a widescale planting of industrial hemp on American
Indian soil have met opposition from federal officials who argue
that any planting or harvesting of hemp would violate federal
law.&nbsp; Presently, Navajo Nation President Albert Hale is awaiting
a legal opinion from the tribe's Justice Department before going
forward with the project.&nbsp; This past March, a ceremonial
planting of industrial hemp seeds by the Coalition for Hemp Awareness
(CHA) took place on Native American soil following the unanimous
passage of a resolution by the Nation to allow for hemp
cultivation to occur on sovereign soil. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as &quot;marijuana's misunderstood cousin,&quot;
industrial hemp is from the same plant species (<i>Cannabis
sativa</i>) that produces marijuana.&nbsp; Unlike marijuana,
however, industrial hemp contains only minute traces of THC, the
psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its medicinal and
euphoric properties.&nbsp; Regardless, DEA spokeswoman Dana
Seeley still maintains that federal laws forbidding the
cultivation of marijuana also apply to hemp.&nbsp; &quot;We are
hopeful that they will not [go forward with their plans],&quot;
she said.&nbsp; Seeley noted that the DEA will continue to
monitor the situation closely and may take action if any
large-scale test plots of hemp are planted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">After decades of unemployment, leaders of the Navajo Nation feel
that hemp cultivation will invigorate the local economy.&nbsp;
The Navajo Nation Hemp Project &quot;is formulated to provide [a] bio-regional
local industry that will create jobs and enhance the agricultural
base,&quot; stated CHA spokeswoman Christie Bohling.&nbsp;
&quot;With the many attributes and by-products of this natural renewable
resource, the Navajo Nation will become self-sufficient in [its]
ability to provide many of its own necessities.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Currently, industrial hemp is grown legally throughout much of
Europe and Asia and can be used to produce a variety of products
such as cosmetics, textiles, paper, paints, plastics, and animal
feed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information regarding the Navajo nation Hemp Project,
please contact CHA @ P.O. Box 9068, Chandler Heights, AZ
85227.&nbsp; For further information or for a copy of the Navajo
nation resolution, please contact either Allen St. Pierre or Paul
Armentano of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i> @ (202) 483-5500.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Drug Czar Admits Most People Who Experiment
With Drugs<br>
&quot;Walk Away&quot; Without Problems</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
During a recent speech at the National Press Club, new Drug Czar
Barry McCaffrey made several remarks that cast doubt on the
validity of the &quot;gateway theory.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCaffrey stated that out of the 90 million Americans who have
experimented with illegal drugs, only 3 million are current
addicts.&nbsp; In addition, he stated that the &quot;overwhelming
majority&quot; of Americans who use illegal drugs simply
&quot;walk away and sa[y] it's not for me.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;In my mind, the Drug Czar is simply acknowledging what we
at <b>NORML</b> have already known,&quot; said Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Federal statistics tell us time and time
again that the bulk the Americans who experiment with illicit
drugs experiment solely with marijuana and do not progress to
harder drugs or run into drug-related problems later in
life.&quot;</p>
