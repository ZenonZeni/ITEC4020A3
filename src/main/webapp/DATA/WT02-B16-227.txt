<h2>History: The PV Effect</h2>
<p><strong>Technology for Space</strong>

<p>Although a few attempts were made 
in the 1950s to use silicon cells in commercial products, it was the new space 
program that gave the technology its first major application.  In 1958, the U.S. 
Vanguard space satellite carried a small array of PV cells to power its radio.  
The cells worked so well that PV technology has been part of the space program ever 
since.  Today, solar cells power virtually all satellites, including those used for 
communications, defense, and scientific research.

supplying nearly all power for satellites.</font>

<p>The computer industry, especially transistor semiconductor technology, also contributed 
to the development of PV cells.  Transistors and PV cells are made from 
<a target="_parent" href="materials.html">similar materials</a> and operate
on the basis of similar <a href="howworks.html">physical mechanisms</a>.  As a result, 
advances in transistor 
research provided a steady flow of new information about PV cell technology.  
(Today, however, this technology transfer process often works in reverse, as advances 
in PV research and development are sometimes adopted by the semiconductor industry.)

<p>Despite these advances, PV devices in 1970 were still too expensive for most "down 
to Earth"uses.  But, in the mid-1970s, rising energy costs, sparked by a world oil 
crisis, renewed interest in making PV technology more affordable.  Since then, the 
federal government, industry, and research organizations have invested billions
of dollars in research, development, and production.  Often, industry and 
the federal government work together, sharing the cost of PV research and development 
(R&D).  (See "About Our Program" from the home page.)

<p>Today's commercial PV systems 
can convert from 7% to 17% of sunlight into electricity. They are highly reliable and 
last 20 years or longer. The cost of PV-generated electricity has dropped 15- to 
20-fold, and PV modules now cost around $6 per watt (W) and produce electricity for 
as little as 25 to 50 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh).
