CARRIERS PLAN TO FOCUS ON MAKING REGS MORE EFFECTIVE (PART 1)

SACRAMENTO - The assembly is in the hands of conservative Republican Curt
Pringle of Garden Grove. The state senate is controlled by a liberal Democrat,
Bill Lockyer of Hayward. There is a very significant election - from a
legislative standpoint -coming up this fall. And so the California workers'
comp insurance lobby is taking a reality check on the chances of any important
bills being passed this year.

The general thinking is that any significant improvements in the system have a
better chance of coming from new or improved regulations that implemented or
should have implemented reforms passed in 1989, 1990 and 1993.

One lobbyist told the Executive,"I don't think public policymakers feel the
need to do any major workers' comp reform. So efforts at improving the
workers' comp system should be viewed as: What can we do? What can enough of
the stakeholders agree to so that they can put something on Wilson's desk?"

Other lobbyists agreed that major reforms are unlikely, but that some cleanup
bills from last year are a possibility. Assemblyman David Knowles,
R-Placerville, has informed the lobby that he is interested in the permanent
partial disability issue and looking at ways to legislatively enact the
American Medical Association guidelines as the impairment rating system.

The Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation reportedly is
considering a study on the schedule to determine whether or not it has a major
impact on the cost of workers' comp and whether or not it adequately
compensates the injured worker, says Barry Carmody, president of the
Association of California Insurance Companies.

According to Mark Webb, senior counsel for the Coalition of California
Compensation Companies, the assembly-man's exposure PPD draft, that is making
the rounds, would also make some significant revisions to the med-legal
process. While the measure is gaining support by the day, Webb feels it is
also the type of bill that would likely face difficulty getting passed this
year.

At the top of the list of 1996 legislative goals for the Alliance of American
Insurers happens to be an effort to pass two of their bills from 1995 - AB
1046 and AB 1859.

"What they have in common," says Pete Gorman, assistant vice president of the
Alliance, "is that they reduce the discretionary authority of the Department
of Industrial Relations. One (AB 1046) brings them in under the OAL (Office of
Administrative Law). The other prohibits them from assigning out the lien
service process."

A second top priority item for the Alliance is one that is on everyone's hit
list, effective action on the Tricor v. State Fund case.

"I don't think the bureau's (WCIRB) weighting scheme (frequency based
experience modifications) does it," says Gorman. "It just flies in the face of
every traditional way of developing X-Mods."

Gorman is also leery of a proposal to give the insurance commissioner
administrative authority to review disputes before they went to litigation.

"We don't agree with that approach," he says. "I think it's too bureaucratic.
And the cost-benefit probably isn't there. What we may do...It seems to me to
be much easier just to run a bill that declares legislative intent that
elevates the standard for litigation from one of injury to one of bad faith."

He explains that an aggrieved employer would have to demonstrate that a
workers' comp carrier had taken a certain action in bad faith in order to have
it actionable. As it is now, he says, the employer can say unintentional or
intentional, "we suffered an injury and so therefore we can sue."

Gorman says, "So just raise the bar on where you can sue. That would be a much
better way to do this, because I don't think the legislature ever intended
this consequence of Tricor. They wanted only to give employers access to the
files." A third Alliance legislative goal is an updated medical fee schedule.

"We've already filed a letter saying we think it's going to end up being a
floor instead of a ceiling," Gorman fears. "And for small companies, we're
placed at a disadvantage. We don't have the leverage and the bargaining power
to get it down below that floor, whereas the big companies do."

The American Insurance Association has a list of specific issues on which it
would like to see action taken during 1996. Terry Miller, assistant vice
president, expresses concern over one of the first issues that needs to be
dealt with, the hospital fee schedule proposed by the Division of Workers'
Compensation.

"The AIA says we should postpone it," Miller relates. "We believe there is
currently insufficient information to accurately gauge the impact of the
schedule on workers' comp hospital costs."

Miller also notes that there appears to be no hospital fee schedule anywhere
in the US that is widely supported as THE model.

The AIA is also involved with PPD and the benefits of permanent partial
disability. It is working on a PPD bill but that the effort is in a very
embryonic stage at this point. Miller said that there were several bills on
the subject being floated around for comment.

A third key issue for the AIA is fraud. Miller says that the AIA has been
discussing the subject with the Department of Insurance "because it wants some
fraud legislation." Exactly what it should be, how broad it should be and
whether it should be geared just to workers' comp is still not determined.

Given the possibility of legislative gridlock, Webb of the CCCC sees the
principal focus for the year should be on reviewing all that's been put in
place over the last five years and seeing "what we can do with Casey Young,
Chip Aubrey and Chuck Quackenbush to make at least the best world we can with
what we have to deal with."

It's no surprise that Tricor is on CCCC's list, and Webb says, "We will work
closely with the California Workers' Compensation Institute and see what types
of things can be done to, at least, bring it into sharper focus - what the
courts need to look at in dealing with these types of bad faith lawsuits.."

CARRIERS PLAN TO FOCUS ON MAKING REGS MORE EFFECTIVE (PART 2)

Webb said that he felt it was significant that the CWCI board in December
decided to "take a step back" on any actions toward Tricor. The question they
had in mind was whether or not there would be any more such suits once the
system had completely shifted to competitive rating. The practices that had
come under fire in Tricor were a phenomenon of the minimum rate law era soon
to be in the dim and distant past.

Webb adds, "At the same time, let's look at ways that insurance cases can be
better made in the courts so that potentially we don't have 12 jurors suddenly
becoming claims managers."

The CCCC plans to present testimony on the permanent disability schedule to
the Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation at its hearing
on January 18 in Los Angeles. The hearing should be a packed house.

Webb says the association will then look at vehicles currently in place,
including Senator Steve Peace's SB 622 which was designed last year to make
the Chula Vista Democrat's 1993 health care organization law more effective.

The CCCC has been working with the California Association of HMOs to invent a
noncontroversial means for implementing managed care in a more effective way.
Webb notes that it's a task that's easier said than done.

"If we have some good treatment guidelines promulgated by the Industrial
Medical Council (and we're able) to combine those with...good utilization data
guidelines already in place, we may be able to get somewhere," Webb reasons.
"And that goes back to saying we need to get 1989, 90 and 93 implemented
before we can come back (to the legislature) and say this doesn't work."

In order to make the HCO process work, there will have to be changes in the
structural flaws - "multiple offerings, the multiple time frame, the ability
to opt out," Webb observes. They make it difficult for a capitated arrangement
to work. "All those are reasons why it has not received much of a response in
the marketplace."

But the point Webb wanted to stress was that there were other medical cost
containment devices that were put in place in 1993, "that aren't there, that
aren't being done right now." Webb says, "That goes back to the IMC and
treatment guidelines which could make managed care work even better under just
30-day control. And we're seeing a lot of managed care marketing using that
30-day control."

The ACIC's Carmody wants to champion a review of regulations. "There are just
too many regulations," says Carmody, "that cost too much money and that don't
provide any additional services to workers, attorneys, insurers or anybody
else." The way to get the ball rolling, he suggests is to get all of the
stakeholders to ask the questions: "Why am I getting this report? Why am I
producing this report? Why do I have to have this report?"

He said you need to take the reporting alone, forgetting the conduct of
business, and evaluate what is really critical and essential, and what is not.
Then you make recommendations to the administration "saying we think these
regulations, these records, this material required by regulation is
unnecessary, and it's a cost-driver. And let the administration make a
decision on whether it wants to repeal the regs or not."

Carmody observes that it doesn't mean the regulations are going to be changed
automatically but it does mean that those being regulated will have the
opportunity to provide their perspective on the value of the regulations.

"The governor basically called for this," Carmody notes. "He called for all
agencies to review their regs. The problem is the agencies do it alone. They
do it in a vacuum, a bureaucratic one in which they decide what is right and
wrong, or what is good and bad for the regulated public."

Carmody emphatically adds, "Frankly, they're not elected. And the public ought
to have some input on whether or not these regulations are needed."

The ACIC president feels there are kindred souls out there who aren't fond of
all the reports they have to fill out and submit to bureaucrats.

"I remember after the '89 and '93 reforms, the moaning from all of the
attorneys about all the paper one has to go through. And all of the reports
that are thrown in the trash can because their workers don't understand them,"
Carmody said. "Perhaps the benefit notices report process is the most
ludicrous of them all. They started out at about 15 and are up to 150 now.
Why? Why!"

AIA, CCCC CONFIRM W/C EXEMPTION FROM 1995'S EXPERT WIITNESS LAW

SACRAMENTO - An opinion by the California Legislative Counsel has put smiles
on the faces of more than just a few members of the workers' comp insurance
community in California.

The Counsel has determined that legislation passed last year does not subject
employers and insurers to additional expert witness fees in cases before the
Workers' Compensation Appeals Board. The legislation, AB 1204, was strongly
opposed by several company trade associations which requested the governor to
veto. He didn't.

Once the measure was chaptered, representatives from the American Insurance
Association and the Coalition of California Compensation Companies jointly
requested that Assemblyman David Knowles (R-Placerville), chairman of the
Assembly Insurance Committee, seek a Counsel clarification on whether the law
resulting from passage of AB 1204 applied to workers' comp.

"This opinion puts to rest any question about the testimony of medical
witnesses in workers' compensation cases," said Terry Miller, AIA assistant
vice president, western region. "It is clear that the director of the Division
of Workers' Compensation has the authority for setting witness fees by
establishing a medical-legal fee schedule."

The Legislative Counsel's opinion specifically states: "The fees for witnesses
providing medical testimony before the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board or
in other workers' compensation proceedings are not affected by the amendments
to Section 1034 of the Code of Civil Procedure enacted by Chapter 797 of the
Statutes of 1995 (AB 1204)."

Miller explained, "The expert witness fee is exactly the kind of hidden cost
that we sought to eliminate with the 1993 reforms. The insurance industry must
continue working together to ensure that those reforms are fully implemented.
Cooperative efforts, such as confirming the witness fee workers' comp
exemption, will ensure that cost savings for employers are realized."

The AIA and the CCCC have asked Casey Young, administrative director of the
Division of Workers' Compensation, to review current Workers' Compensation
Appeals Board rules regarding witness fees to make certain that they are
consistent with the provisions of Section 5307.6 of the Labor Code, which
authorizes the director to establish the medical-legal fee schedule.

CA-BASED W/C CARRIERS RANKED BY DIRECT LOSS RATIO, 1994 3RD QUARTER

SAN FRANCISCO - The third quarter 1995 workers' comp insurance figures for
California-based carriers, a regular feature in the Executive, are reported on
page 3.

The carriers are ranked according to their direct loss ratios with the highest
at the top of the page, lowest at the bottom. Keep in mind, the figures
represent each company's, or group of companies, total business writings, not
just those for California.

Fremont Indemnity of California, at the request of its management has been
separated from the other members of its group in order to reflect a more
accurate picture. Readers' attention is drawn to a boxed section, Direct
Premium Change, which reflects the percentage change between the current YTD
and previous YTD premiums.

FIRST W/C BILL, SB636, SCHEDULED FOR HEARING

SACRAMENTO - Amid the turmoil of Assembly leadership fight, the second half of
California s 1995-96 biennial legislative session got underway last week, and
the first workers' comp bill, SB 636 by Sen. Raymond Haynes (R-Murietta), is
scheduled for a hearing today, January 8, in the Senate Transportation
Committee.

SB 636 would require a driving school owner who employs one or more driving
instructors to file proof of workers' comp coverage with the Department of
Motor Vehicles. The measure is opposed by the Association of California
Insurance Companies.

A bill supported by the workers' comp insurance community in general, AB 1859
by Assemblywoman Valerie Brown (D-Sonoma), would, if passed and signed,
rescind the Division of Workers' Compensation's exemption from the
Administrative Procedure Act in adopting regulations. It is scheduled and can
be considered at any time for concurrence in senate amendments. The bill is
pending without a date set for action.

COALITION OPENS DOOR TO ALL W/C CARRIERS IN CALIFORNIA

LOS ANGELES - John Pasqualetto, president of Great States Insurance Company,
was reelected chairman of the Coalition of California Compensation Companies
at its fourth annual meeting.

The coalition's board of directors unanimously approved a change in its
by-laws opening membership to all admitted workers' compensation insurance
companies doing business in California.

Commenting on the change in the by-laws, Chairman Pasqualetto said, "We
recognize that the dynamics in both the market and the legislature that led to
the creation of the CCCC have changed dramatically. The new competitive rating
environment has certainly delivered greater volatility and diversity in the
marketplace. We intend to refine our focus in the coming year and work to
support and facilitate the continued transition to open rating."

Stan Braun, president of Pacific Rim Assurance Company, and Mary Lou Misrahy,
president of USA Casualty Company, will continue in their positions of
treasurer and secretary, respectively.

The primary focus of the CCCC for 1996 is one of the most vexing issues
affecting workers' comp companies in California today, the rise in bad faith
litigation. The key court case on the issue, Tricor v. State Fund, tends to
dominate the debate over virtually all aspects of insurer operations, not just
reserving practices, the CCCC notes.

Any solution to the problem, the CCCC opines, must acknowledge the need of
policyholders to have legitimate complaints resolved while at the same time
balanced with the legitimate interest of insurers and producers to provide
quality services to employers and timely payment of benefits to injured
workers.

COMMISSION TO PUBLISH SAFETY COURSE ON INTERNET

SAN FRANCISCO - The California Commission on Health and Safety and Workers'
Compensation is developing a comprehensive list of workers' compensation,
health and safety related courses offered by colleges, universities and
community colleges. The list will be posted on the Internet as well as printed
for members of the public without on-line access.

The commission's new service will include the name of the institution,
information on degree and certification programs, course names and
descriptions, schedule of classes, tuition costs (if any) and referrals and/or
instructions on how to obtain additional information.

The commission plans for the project to be ready for the winter and spring
1996 courses. The list of courses will be available on the commission page
under the Workers' Compensation and Division of Occupation Safety and Health
categories of the DIR (Department of Industrial Relations) Home Page at the
Internet address http://www.dir.ca.gov, and they welcome visitors. The
information will be updated each semester.

MISSOURI LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WORKERS' COMP REFORM AGAIN

JEFFERSON CITY - A workers' comp reform bill, similar to one that died in
committee last year, will be introduced in the Missouri legislature in the
upcoming session.

The 1996 version of the reform bill will attempt to more clearly define
workplace accidents, give administrative law judges less leeway in their
decisions and institute other reforms aimed at reducing fraud and speeding up
payments.

The opponents of the bill last year are reported to have the same objections
to the new version. They claim the bill is too pro-employer.

Legislators may lack the appetite to push forward since premiums have been
coming down, and there seems to be little perceived need for additional
reform.

MISSISSIPPI W/COMP RATES TO DROP 11.3%

JACKSON - George Dale, Mississippi Insurance Commissioner, says workers' comp
insurance rates will drop an average 11.3 percent starting March 1 for the
state's employers. This reduction is recommended by the National Council on
Compensation Insurance.

The commissioner predicts that the rate decline will save the state's
businesses an estimated $25.5 million in 1996. NCCI spokesman Robert Maxwell
said safer workplaces and attacks on insurance fraud were helping to
contribute to the improving cost situation. The 11.3 percent applies only to
the voluntary market rates, not the assigned risk plan.

OREGON WORKPLACE INJURY, ILLNESS RATE CONTINUES DECLINE STARTED IN 1988

SALEM - Just released 1994 Oregon workplace injury and illness data show that
new record lows have been set for both public and private employers.

Last year's public sector rate was 6.3 cases, which includes all work-related
accidents and ailments recordable under Oregon OSHA, per 100 full-time
workers. For the private sector it was 8.7 cases per 100.

The 1994 rates continue a downward trend that began in 1988, coinciding with
the state's effort to reform the workers' comp system, cut costs and improve
safety. Last year's public sector rate fell 29.2 percent in the last seven
years and 21.6 percent for the private sector.

NINE MONTHS RESULTS ARE STUNNING

Some interesting developments appear as far as premium decreases. The average
for all California-based carriers reporting on a timely basis (note: Alistar
Ins.. did not) is a net premium decrease through the first nine months of open
rating of 22.1%.

Among the most newsworthy is California Compensation Insurance, a unit of
Foundation Health, which changed from a growth position of 4% second quarter
year-to-date, to a net decrease of 7.3% in premiums at the end of the first
three quarters. This represents a change in premium position of 11.3%.
California Compensation is reporting a direct loss percentage of 54.8% which
appears to compare favorably with the average reported figure of 59.3%.

Allianz Insurance Company and Unicare Insurance are now the only two carriers
of significance which are reporting premium growth. Allianz 15% YTD and
Unicare 10.3%.

NOW COME THE PREMIUM INCREASES

Clearly putting the writing on the walls, many carriers have filed new rates
for 1996. Most do not take effect until February, well after the competitive
January renewals. The loss ratio debacle predicted by all in the early days of
open rating seems to be in the offing, albeit fairly well covered up.

With premiums down some 22 percent and pure loss ratios being reported at 60
percent the actual combined loss ratios we will see - after development - will
prove this year mighty unprofitable for many carriers. Will combined ratios be
reported in the 130s to 150s like so many pundits predicted? Nope, they will
not be reported in this year's results. But they will develop.

According to the Compline rate analysts (actually they can also be called
rate-icidal maniacs because they seem to actually enjoy the monitoring of this
stuff) there have been some significant changes in the rate basis from many
carriers. Here is a brief recap.

Fremont Group filed a 33.2% increase and re-calculated its own rates again.
State Compensation Insurance Fund increased manual rates 8% resulting in a
6.8% increase in collectable premium. SCIF is maintaining its current premium
discounts. Allianz Insurance is adding a 24-hour pilot program and taking a 4%
increase. Fairmont/TIG Insurance filed a 14.7% increase in rates. Citation
Insurance has taken a 9.3% increase. National American Insurance Company of
California is maintaining its '95 rates but dropped its split rating which was
based upon EAP over or under $10,000. Great States Insurance, a unit of FHP,
has instituted an 11% rate increase. Liberty Mutual Insurance Group filed
increases of from 9.7 to 15.2 percent depending upon the company. Safeco has
provided for an 11.3% increase, although it is using the same multipliers as
last year. Golden Eagle Insurance calculated a change of 10.782% and
recalculated its own rates again. Kemper Companies took a 10.1% increase.

So there you have it.

REGULATORY LOBBYING

We tend to think of lobbying as being a function of exerting one's will or
wishes (or at least attempting to) on the legislative process. But those whose
institutional memories or practical experience remember the legendary Clayton
R. Jackson, know that lobbying is also a function of the manipulation of the
regulator's process. Rules and Regs make up the real game sometimes, not the
laws passed by elected representatives.

And this year, more focus will be on changing, amending and deleting
regulations than the legislative-type reforms. One of the leaders of this
process is Ed Woodward, honcho over at the California Workers' Compensation
Institute. He is clearly emerging as one of the chief architects of what may
very well become a key reform year in California.

DOI'S FRAZIER TO HEAD INITIATIVE

Rex Frazier, the chief of the Legislative Bureau for the California Department
of Insurance in Sacramento, has been given a temporary assignment heading up
Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush's initiative to ban non-economic payments to
uninsured motorists and drunk drivers.

The commissioner filed the initiative, "Personal Responsibility Act," for
inclusion in the November 1996 ballot. While the at-fault driver would have to
pay medical expenses, lost wages, etc. to the uninsured, he would not pay
anything for pain and suffering. The commissioner says it will save at least
$300 million a year in auto insurance costs.

Some industry lobbyists hope that, win-lose-or-draw, the assignment won't
affect Frazier's return to his post. Reportedly, Greg Butler, Quackenbush's
deputy for policy and research will fill in for Frazier.
