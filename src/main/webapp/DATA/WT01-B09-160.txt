<B>Project Summary:</B>
<P>
PRI and HEVDP have crafted a three phased plan to evaluate high
voltage power, ceramic based ultracapacitors for EHV application.
<P>
In Phase I, <B><I>Demonstration, Feasibility and Projected Design
Characteristics,</B></I> PRI plans to provide on loan to HEVDP three
(3) PRI Ultracapacitor devices each rated at 100 VDC, 1 F. These
devices were produced under contract to the California Energy
Commission and are to be evaluated for core performance consisting
of capacitance, energy storage, ESR, etc. PRI will work with HEVDP
to facilitate test protocol, procedure, and interpretation of
results. Additionally, PRI will extend testing of devices in a
hybrid test bed configuration with advanced batteries to be decided
by HEVDP. PRI will work with HEVDP to establish preliminary design
criteria and perform feasibility analyses leading to full vehicle
demonstration.
<P>
In Phase II, <B><I>System Sized Ultracapacitor Fabrication,</B></I> a
system sized demonstration device will be produced by PRI and
incorporated into an S10 pickup with advanced batteries as part
of the FY 94 Advanced Battery Testing Program. Preliminary specifications
consist of a 320 VDC, 250 kJ device in modular form for full flexibility
of testing.
<P>
In Phase III, <B><I>Next Generation Research and Development,</B></I>
PRI will expand and accelerate ongoing development and demonstration
of energy storage materials which meet the cost and high performance
criteria consistent with PNGV goals. Engineering analysis dictates
material cost, specific capacitance, electronic conductivity,
and cell geometry to accomplish these objectives.
