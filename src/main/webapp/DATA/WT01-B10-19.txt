<P>
&quot;When we had sex on our wedding night, instead of having
an ultimate experience with my husband, sex was so painful I ended
up in tears,&quot; Marilyn P. wrote to her <a href="witsend.html">Witsendo</a> friends. &quot;I
thought something was wrong with me . . .that I was frigid or
something.
<P>
&quot;When I went to the doctor, I told him I'd always had some
pain with my periods but that my cramps were getting worse.
<P>
&quot;He did a pelvic exam and I screamed when he touched my left
ovary.  After doing an ultrasound examination, he told me that
my left ovary was swollen to twice its normal size. He also felt
small bumps behind my uterus. He recommended doing a laparoscopy
to find out what was going on.
<P>
        
&quot;That's when I got the news: endometriosis at the ripe old
age of twenty-three, and that I had probably had endometriosis as a teenager! What a way to start married life.&quot;
<P>
<b>What is it?  </b><P>
<img align="left" src="endo7.jpg">  <a href="galendo.html">Endometriosis</a> is described as the presence of endometrial tissue in locations outside the endometrial (uterine) cavity. Endometriosis is commonly found in the cul-de-sac (behind the uterus), the rectovaginal septum (the tissue between the rectum and vagina), on the surface of the rectum, the fallopian tubes and ovaries, the uterosacral ligaments, the bladder, and the pelvic side wall. Generally endometriosis in the rectovaginal septum is more likely to deeply invade the underlying structures.<p>

<b>Is endometriosis a genetic disease?</b><P> 
Studies have shown that sisters have a six times increased risk compared to their husband's sisters.  Other studies show up to an eight times increased risk when compared to other women. Affected sisters are more likely to have severe disease than other. Although these studies suggest a genetic basis, presently, the mode of inheritance is unknown. The OXEGENE Study is enrolling family members with endometriosis to try and identify the genetic basis of this disease. <p>
<b>How common is it?</b><P>
At the time of tubal ligation 2-5% of women will have endometriosis, while between 25-50% of infertile women have been reported to have endometriosis. Endometriosis affects 5 million U.S. women, approximately 6-7% of all females, 30-40% of whom are infertile.  <p>


<b>What are the causes? </b> <P>
No one theory seems to explain all cases. Several theories, however, have
been postulated:
<UL>
<LI>The endometrial tissue migrates from the uterus through the
tubes into the pelvis. (This doesn't explain how women with their
tubes tied develop the disease or why it remains after hysterectomy.)
<LI>An abnormality in the immune system allows normally shed endometrial cells to attach and grow.
<LI>The disease is caused by a genetic birth defect as evidenced
by the tendency for it to run in families. Patients with an affected
mother or siblings are more likely (61 percent) to have severe
endometriosis than those without affected relatives (23 percent).
<LI>Tissue in the abdominal cavity changes into endometrial tissue
as a result of repeated inflammation (sheer speculation at this
point).
<LI>The endometrial tissue spreads from the uterus to the abdominal
cavity through the lymphatic system or bloodstream.
</UL><p>
Commonly during the menstrual period, cells can be found in the fluid behind the uterus. The most widely held theory, retrograde menstruation, states that endometriosis occurs when endometrial fragments attach to nearby pelvic structures and grow.  Other theories include tissue transplantation, induction of changes in peritoneal lining cells, spread through uterine veins, and direct extension through the lymphatic system.  <p>

As endometrial cells are frequently seen in peritoneal fluid in all women at the time of menses, one would expect endometriosis to develop in everyone. Obviously this is not appear the case.  Unfortunately, we don't really know why. Is the immune system the cause? Immunological changes have been demonstrated in women with endometriosis, however, it is uncertain whether these immunologic findings are responsible for the endometriosis or are a result of the inflammation caused by endometriosis.  <p>

<B>How Does Endometriosis Cause Fertility Problems?</B><P>
<P>
In cases where there is obvious disruption of the normal anatomy, endometriosis is a known cause of fertility problems.  In fact 30-40% of patients with endometriosis are infertile.  This is two to three times the rate of infertility in the general population.<p> 

In patients with endometriosis, the monthly fecundity (chance of getting pregnant) decreases by 12-36%.  However, the long term cumulative pregnancy rates are normal in patients with minimal endometriosis and normal anatomy.  Studies provide contradicting information, but the bulk of research at this time indicates that pregnancy rates are not improved by treating minimal endometriosis. <p> 
Under the influence of cycling female hormones, each month the
displaced endometrial tissue grows and sheds blood at the time
of menses. Instead of flowing harmlessly outside the body, however,
the excrement wreaks havoc in the abdominal cavity.
<P>
The resulting chronic tissue inflammation leads to the formation
of adhesions and scars, which surround and entrap delicate reproductive
organs. The adhesions can be so extensive that they literally
freeze the tubes, ovaries, and uterus into place (stages III and
IV). The eggs themselves are trapped in the heavy shrouds of scar
tissue surrounding the ovaries, and infertility results. As the
disease spreads, the older endometrial cells burn out, leaving
dead scar tissue in their wake.
<P>
Even mild forms of the disease (stages I and II) may interfere
with fertility. It is hypothesized that the prostaglandins (hormones)
secreted by the active, young endometrial implants or other chemicals secreted by white blood cells may interfere
with the reproductive organs by causing muscular contractions
or spasms. The tube may be unable to pick up
the egg, and the stimulated uterus may reject implantation. In addition, sperm motility may be adversely affected along with the ability of the sperm to penetrate into the egg. Although
the mechanisms are not fully understood, endometriosis may also
result in anovulation (17 percent), cause a luteal phase defect
interfering with implantation, or cause a luteinized unruptured
follicle.
<P>
Some researchers suggest that the woman's body may form antibodies
against the misplaced endometrial tissue. The same antibodies
may attack the uterine lining and cause the high spontaneous-abortion
rate: up to three times the normal rate. (Fortunately, removing
the endometriosis with medication or with surgery will reduce
this risk to normal.)
<P>
The normal tissue surrounding the endometriosis implant becomes
puckered and ischemic (suffering from lack of oxygen), causing
pain similar to that from a heart attack. Attacked over a prolonged
period, the fallopian tubes may become inflamed and swell shut. Blocked by adhesions, the tubes
can no longer provide safe passage for egg, sperm, and embryo.
Ectopic pregnancies become a real danger: up to sixteen times
more likely than the normal population (16 percent vs. 1 percent).


Let's evaluate the specific factors that may contribute to infertility in patients with endometriosis. <p> 
<B><I>Hormonal parameters:</I></B>  Compared to a normal cycle, the follicular phase may be shorter in patients with endometriosis, the estradiol may be lower, and a blunted LH surge may be seen.  Progesterone levels and luteal phase endometrial biopsies, however, are normal.  There is a tendency towards greater number of follicles which are smaller at the time of the LH surge in patients with endometriosis.  However, this data does not prove that endometriosis is the cause of infertility.  Women with subtle ovulatory dysfunction are more likely to have infertility and it may be that infertility or an abnormal hormone profile increases the likelihood of endometriosis.<p>  

<b><I>Luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome:</I></b>  
In women with severe pelvic adhesions where the ovary is encased, luteinized unruptured follicle (LUF) may be noted.  This is believed to occur when, despite normal hormonal parameters (LH surge), the egg is not released from the ovary.  Endometriosis is found in 63% of those patients reported to have LUF.  LUF is seen in 35% of patients with endometriosis versus 11% of patients without endometriosis.  However, the detection of follicular rupture by ultrasound and laparoscopy is very subjective and the diagnosis of this condition is complicated. Therefore, studies that look at endometriosis and LUF must be held suspect. <p> 

<B><I>IVF and experimental models:</I></B> Studies in rabbits have shown that surgical induction of endometriosis leads to a decrease in fertility from 75% to 25%.  This may be due to anovulation associated with endometrial implants.  Studies have evaluated immune modification in the rabbit model to attempt to restore fertility. <p>

We know that during in vitro fertilization endometriosis patients have normal hormonal profiles. There is a tendency towards fewer oocytes and it appears that oocytes derived from ovaries with endometriomas may have a lower fertilization rate and implantation rate. <p> 

In order to understand whether this effect is due to the embryo or the uterine environment we can look at donor embryo studies. Dr. Simon found decreased donor oocyte implantation rates when the oocytes were from women with endometriosis.  In his study, endometriosis in the recipient had no effect on implantation while other studies have found conflicting results.<p>  

On the other hand, Dr. Bruce Lessey performed endometrial biopsy surface at the time of implantation and found lower levels of vitronectin (an adhesion molecule on the endometrial surface) in women with unexplained and endometriosis related infertility.  Treatment with Lupron and ovulation induction appeared to restore this implantation marker and fertility. <p> 

<B><I>Peritoneal Effects:</I></B> The effect of endometriosis on the peritoneal environment may adversely affect fertility.  There is an increased volume of peritoneal fluid, and peritoneal macrophages (scavenger white blood cells), are increased both in number and activity.  Cytokines (white blood cell chemical messengers) such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, Interferon, C3, C4 are all increased.  These  may adversely affect sperm oocyte interaction, sperm mobility and survival, and oocye pick up.  In addition, serum samples obtained from women with endometriosis were found to be embryotoxic in mouse embryo cultures 78% of the time versus 20% in women without endometriosis.<p> 
<B><I>Immune System:</I></B> <a href="endoimm.html">The immune system is affected by endometriosis</a> and may adversely affect fertility.  Patients with endometriosis may show decreased nature killer cell function, and decreased reactivity to transplanted endometrial tissue.  In addition, complement, an immune component that breaks apart abnormal cells, is elevated in patients with endometriosis. <p> 

<P>
<B>What Are the Symptoms of Endometriosis?</B>
<P>
Nearly one-third of the women having endometriosis have no symptoms
other than infertility. The others have varying degrees of symptoms,
depending on the stage of the disease. Oddly enough, the early
stages or milder forms are frequently more painful than the later
stages. We believe this is because the young endometrial tissue
liberates spasm-causing prostaglandins, whereas the older endometrial
tissue simply burns out and turns into inactive scar tissue.

The most common symptoms associated with endometriosis are pain and infertility, however, premenstrual spotting, urinary urgency, rectal bleeding, painful urination, bloody cough, and skin nodules may also be noted.  Endometriosis may frequently mimic other disorders such as pelvic adhesions, dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps), irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, and ulcer disease. Careful evaluation is necessary to ensure accurate diagnosis.  Diarrhea or rectal bleeding and tenesmus (sense of rectal fullness) at the time of menses are particularly telling symptoms.<p>

<P>
<B>Diagnosing Endometriosis</B>
<P>
Any complaint related to menses suggests endometriosis. Endometriosis
associated with the classic symptoms of painful menstrual periods
and/or painful sexual intercourse is relatively easy to diagnose.
However, when the symptoms are less suggestive-unexplained infertility,
irregular periods, or spotting, for example-identifying the disease may be more difficult.
Occasionally while doing the pelvic examination I can feel the
telltale beading on the outside of the reproductive organs. The
only definitive diagnostic procedure for endometriosis, however,
is a direct look inside the abdominal cavity and a biopsy of the
tissue.
<P>
<B>Diagnostic Laparoscopy</B>
<P>
Since <a href="ch16mb.html#lap">laparoscopy</a> requires general anesthesia, I try to rule out
all other male and female fertility factors before performing
it. Depending on the woman's age, history, and findings from the
workup, however, I may choose a more aggressive diagnostic approach
for a particular couple. If the woman is in her thirties and if
she complains of pelvic pain or has unexplained infertility, I'm
likely to perform a laparoscopy sooner.
<P>
<a href="galendo.html">Viewed through the laparoscope</a>, the endometrial lesions look like
raised shaggy brown or blue-black areas ranging from 2 to 10 cm
(1 to 4 inches) in diameter. If the disease has been present for
a prolonged period of time, the tissue adjacent to the implants
will pucker and burned-out areas will show fibrotic scars. Advanced
endometriosis (stage III or IV) may invade, pucker, and erode
the walls of affected organs, and adhesions may be so dense that
they &quot;freeze&quot; the pelvic organs into distorted positions.<p>
<p> 
Dr. Redwine has described the progressive nature of endometriosis lesions. They are first seen as clear vesicles, then become red, and then progress to black lesions over a period of 7-10 years.  Dr. Karnaky described water blister lesions becoming blue dome cysts over a period of 4-10 years.  The clear lesions are seen are at an average age of 21.5 while black scarred lesions are seen at a mean age of 31.9.  This progression from clear to red to black lesions with age confirms the progressive nature of this disease if left untreated.  Disease will progress in 47-64% of women without therapy and approximately 20% of women with therapy.<p>
While performing the laparoscopy, I'll force a colored dye through
the cervix, uterus, and tubes to demonstrate tubal patency. Many
times, the dye will flow through only one tube (preferential flow)
because that tube provides the least resistance to the colored
liquid. Although this does not mean that the other tube is blocked,
it does not rule out that possibility, either.<p>

There is poor correlation between the degree of pain or infertility and the severity of disease.  Early lesions which are clear or red are metabolically more active than older, dark, fibrotic lesions. This metabolic activity may be responsible for the associated infertility, immune abnormalities, urinary urgency, pelvic pain or diarrhea.<p>

<h2 align="center">Surgical Treatment for Endometriosis</h2>
<B>When Is Surgery Indicated?</B>
<P>
The severity of the disease, the woman's history of infertility,
the intensity of her desire for pregnancy, and her age all play
a role in determining whether or not to do conservative surgery
to restore reproductive structures or to perform a hysterectomy. Unfortunately, even hysterectomy is not a guaranteed cure for the disease as up to 30% of women have persistent pain.<P>

In women with distorted tubal-ovarian anatomy due to endometriosis, the first surgery is the most effective. Repeat surgical interventions are less effective at restoring fertility, than the initial attempt, which is best performed by a skilled endoscopist. <p>

The most common surgical procedures performed with the laparoscope
are the cutting and removal (lysis) of pelvic adhesions surrounding
the ovaries, tubes, and uterus, exision or surgical
removal of endometriotic implants and removal of ovarian endometriomas.<p>

Surgical treatment of endometriosis consists of cautery, coagulation, excision or vaporization.  As most cul-de-sac endometriosis is generally deeper than it may at first appear, excision should be the treatment of choice. Vaporization of adhesions on the ovarian surface, bladder flap, and uterine peritoneum may be beneficial. <p>

<img align="right" src="endo8.jpg">Uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) Since sensory nerves from the uterus run inside the uterosacral ligament, sometimes I will sever the ligament to relieve the pain associated with endometriosis. This proecedure relieves discomfort related in menstrual cramps in up to 85% of patients. Unfortunately LUNA does not relieve pain associated with adhesions, endometriomas and pelvic sidewall endometriosis. <p>

For more severe pain, a pre-sacral neurectomy (PSN) can be performed. In this operation, the the bundle of sensory nerves are cut as they enter the pelvis. As the nerves are surrounded by large veins, bleeding can occassionally complicate this operation.<p>

Treatment of ovarian endometriomas has included removal of the ovary, simple drainage, destruction of the cyst-lining with laser, bipolar electrosurgery, monopolar electrosurgery, and excision of the ovarian cyst. Although in many cases the cyst-lining can be stripped from inside the ovary during laparoscopy, in approximately 30% of the cases, this cannot be performed.  In these cases, unless destruction of the lining is carried out, the endometrioma will likely recur.  Use of an Argon beam coagulator, C02 laser or bipolar electrocautery are the methods of choice in this situation.  Monopolar cautery must be used with caution as deeper penetration with this method may destroy normal ovarian tissue and cause premature ovarian failure. <p> 

<B>Success Rate with Surgery</B>
<P>
Pregnancy rates following surgery generally range between 35-40% for severe endometriosis to 55-65% with milder disease.  Of those who become pregnant, 30 percent conceive
within three months, 50 percent within six months, and 86 percent
within fifteen months. There appears to be no difference in pregnancy rates with laparoscopy or laparotomy with laser or electrosurgical techniques.  While long term pregnancy rates may approach 65%, surgical studies that look at fecundity show monthly pregnancy rates as low as 3-6% per month following surgical treatment of this disease (versus 20% per month in fertile women). Usually, normal monthly pregnancy rates can be achieved with ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination. Post-operative pregnancy rates appear best for those with infertility of short duration of one to two years of 68%. Those who have been trying between three and seven years have a 43% pregnancy rate, while those with eight or more years of infertility demonstrate a pregnancy rate of less than 10%. <p>

<B>When Hysterectomy May Be Appropriate</B>
<P>
Complete hysterectomy-including removal of the ovaries-is the treatment of choice for women past their reproductive age. With
this procedure the recurrence rate is only 1 to 3 percent. However, the use of estrogen-only hormone replacement or leaving an ovary behind significantly increase your risk that pain will recur. Up to 30% or more will experience recurrent endometriosis symptoms if both ovaries are not removed. For this resason I often recommend a hormone-free period before initiating hormone replacement therapy with a combination of estrogen and progesterone.
<p>Some
women with a history of severe pain will request a hysterectomy.
After fighting her endometriosis and Michael's retrograde ejaculation
for years, Shelley T. decided to have a hysterectomy.
<P>
&quot;It felt so good for our fertility nightmare to end,&quot;
Shelley said. &quot;We could finally have sex for fun. And we
didn't have to worry anymore about whether or not my period would
start each month. I didn't realize how much pain I had each month
until it was over. I wish I'd done it sooner.&quot;

<B>Medical Treatment for Endometriosis</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<B>Historical Medical Approaches</B><p>


Multiple studies have reported a 4-5 times improvement in fecundity (monthly chance of conception) with empirical treatment, super-ovulation with either clomiphene or injectable gonadotropins (Humegon, Metrodin, Pergonal) combined with intrauterine insemination.<p>  

<P>
A number of different types of medical regimens have been tried
but discarded because of adverse side effects and questionable
results: androgen, estrogen, progestin, and high-dose estrogen-progestin.
The aim of all these therapies was to suppress ovulation and menses
for a prolonged period of time in hopes that in an unstimulated
environment (decidualization) the disease would regress.
<P>
Birth Control Pills, Danazol,  Lupron, Synarel, Zoladex, depot-Provera and Norplant have not been proven effective as either primary or adjunctive therapy (combined with surgery) for endometriosis related infertility. While the use of medical treatment may decrease inflammatory reactions making surgical correction easier and reduce endometriosis-related pain, use of these medications in patients with minimal disease is of no proven benefit in treating infertility. <p> 

<B>&quot;Taking the Pill Decreases Pain but Won't Help You Get Pregnant&quot;</B>
<P>
Because many women reported that their symptoms from endometriosis
subsided when they were on birth control pills, doctors began
using the Pill to control the disease. By suppressing their periods
for nine months or more with very high-dose birth control pills,
80 to 90 percent of these women suffered less pain, and nearly
half became pregnant when they discontinued the medication. However,
endometriosis recurred in a third of these patients. Because of
the adverse side effects from high-dose hormones and the marginal results, high-dose birth control pills are not used today to treat endometriosis.
<P>
Today's low-dose birth control pill not only may reduce the risk
of developing endometriosis, but for many it also seems to provide
temporary relief from the symptoms. Some physicians suggest that their patients skip the placebo  pills (pills 22-28) and start a new pack each 21 days. While this may be an effective method of treating pain related to endometriosis, the Pill is also very effective contraceptive.<p>

The Pill may also preserve the woman's fertility by temporarily containing the milder forms
of the disease. For these reasons young women with endometriosis
may wish to take the Pill until they decide to start their families.
<P>
I should caution you, however, that if you suspect you have endometriosis,
you should not delay treatment by taking birth control pills until
you are thirty years old. By then the disease may already silently
have invaded your reproductive organs and made restoring your
fertility difficult.
<P>
<B>Danazol Therapy</B>
<P>
Initially popular after being introduced in 1975, because of unpleasant and often irreversible side-effects, Danazol is rarely the chosen for initial therapy. Danazol inhibits the release of FSH and LH by the pituitary gland.
The endometrial implants will improve in 85 to 95 percent of the
women taking the drug. Danazol seems to be most effective in women
with mild or moderate endometriosis (stages I and II). Menses
return four to six weeks after stopping the drug, and the best
chances for pregnancy occur about two months after that. Pregnancy
rates may be as high as 50 percent with Danazol therapy. Due to
the side effects, however, about 5 to 10 percent of the women
stop taking Danazol. Table 17-2 illustrates the astounding improvement
this drug offers. Potential side effects are profiled in table
17-3.

<B>GnRH agonists Can Provide Relieve</B>
<P>
The pituitary hormone LH and FSH stimulate ovarian production of estrogen, the major stimulus for growth of endometriosis. By blocking the production and release of LH and FSH, GnRH agonist (Lupron, Synarel and Zoladex)lower estrogen to menopausal levels.  The drug creates the pseudomenopausal state desirable for reducing the size and number of endometriotic lesions. Synarel, a daily nasal spray; Lupron, a monthly injection; and Zoladex, a monthly implant; appear to be equally effective. <p>Side effects are most often due to the lowered estrogen levels. They include: hot flashes, vaginal dryness, headaches and sleep disturbances. Rarely, complications such as short term memory loss, muscle, bone and joint pains and decreased bone calcium. Soreness at the injection site may be seen with Lupron and Zoladex, while nasal stuffiness and burning have been reported with the use of Synarel.<p> 

These medications are approved for six months of use, and many endometriosis sufferers report six months of blissful relief. Unfortuantely, not all women respond and <B><I>GnRH agonists are definitely not a cure for endometriosis.</I></B> They merely suppress endometriosis during the course of therapy.  Unfortunately, without aggressive surgical excision, endometriosis often returns within months of discontinuing any of these medications. <I>So why use them if the endometriosis is going to return?</I><p> 
<ul>
<li><B>GnRH agonists reduce endometriosis-related pain.</B> If the diagnosis of endometriosis was made at a previous surgery, often a GnRH-agonist can effectively reduce your pain. After a three to six month course of therapy, you can either switch to the Pill, Depo-provera or Norplant as these often prolong the pain relief induced by a GnRH agonist. Others choose to continue agonist therapy with add-back. <p>Add-back therapy involves the daily administration of a small dose of estrogen and progesterone. Given together in combination, these two medications will lessen the side effects due to low estrogen and minimize further bone loss. Further steps to prevent bone loss include <a href="ostem.html">monitoring bone turnover with NTX</a> and insuring an adequate dietary calcium intake.<p> 

<li><B>GnRH agonists may faciliate surgical treatment.</B> By reducing endometriosis related inflammation, surgery is easier. These is less raw surface area when endometriosis is resected and adhesions are separated. This may minimize subsequent adhesion reformation. <p>

<li><B>GnRH agonists can be used as a diagnostic tool.</B> You may wish to postone costly diagnostic surgery. If you benefit from a short course of GnRH agonist, it is more likely that surgical excision will be of benefit than if you did not respond with a significant reducation of pain.<p>
<li><B>GnRH agonists do not restore normal fertility in patients with endometriosis.</b> While GnRH agonists can benefit patients undergoing ovulation induction or in vitro fertilization, their use after surgery in patients with minimal or moderate disease that has been excised does not improve pregnancy rates. </ul><p>

<B>Medical Therapy Combined with Surgery</B>
<P>
In women with more severe endometriosis (stage III or IV), medical therapy may be combined with surgery to provide even better results. Frequently
physicians prescribe the medication prior to surgery to reduce
the number and size of the lesions. Surgery following medical treatment is much less likely to destroy healthy tissue and cause
adhesions.
<P>
To reduce inflammation and in an attempt to clear up any remaining endometriosis, medical treatment is also prescribed
following surgery. Reportedly this approach increases the chances for women with severe endometriosis to become pregnant.
Some physicians, however, feel that <I>since the highest levels
of fertility immediately follow surgery</I>, postponing ovulation
with postsurgical medical treatment may rob you of your best chances
for pregnancy.
<P>
<B>Therapy for Mild Endometriosis (Stages I and II)</B>
<P>
Treatments for mild forms of the disease are controversial. Some physicians feel that since adhesions may not form at this stage,it's better to take a wait-and-see approach (<I>expectant therapy</I>)rather than prescribing heavy doses of medication. Although most studies have found no proven benefit of  surgical treatment for minimal endometriosis, more recent studies suggest increased pregnancy rates after completely excising all endometriosis.  Therefore, as endometriosis progresses in up to 60% of women if untreated, aggressive surgical management at the time of discovery leads to the long term best results. <p> 

After exising all endometrial implants with the laparoscope,
up to 75 percent of these women will become pregnant within twelve
to eighteen months without additional medication. If no pregnancy
occurs within six, the patient is older than 35 years of age or, has been attempting pregnancy for over two years, <a href="sproviui.html">super-ovulation and intrauterine insemination</a> is often successful.<p> For those with extensive inflammatory endometriosis, I recommend a short course of GnRH agonist followed immediately by more agressive therapy. However, for most patients with minimal or mild disease who have undergone complete surgical excision, the use of GnRH agonists or danocrine are not likely to improve pregnancy rates or prevent recurrences.<P>
<b>Therapy for Moderate and Severe Endoemtriosis (Stages III and IV)</b><p>
Stages III and IV endometriosis, however, often cause thicker and broader-based adhesions than
early endometriosis and often cause the ovary to stick to the
pelvic sidewall. Frequently the wall of the large bowel or rectum are involved and a portion of the bowel will also need to be removed. Since the removal of these types of adhesions and endometriosis of the bowel and rectum require more care than removing the filmy ones associated with earlier stages of the disease, this type of surgery is best performed by a well skilled endometriosis team. <p>Prior to planning your surgery, I will have you consult with a bowel surgeon who may recommend a barium enema (x-ray) or an office procedure where the rectum and sigmoid colon are visualized with a flexible telescope. I will often recommend a GnRH agonist (Lupron, Synarel, Zoladex) prior to surgery to decrease inflammation. To safely perform bowel surgery it is necessary to perform a bowel prep a day or two before surgery (enemas, antibiotics and magnesium citrate or Golytely). But as I can never be sure when endometriosis of the bowel or rectum will be encountered and bowel surgery will become necessary, I order the bowel prep on all laparoscopy patients.  <P>

<CENTER>
<B>Resolving Multiple Problems Is a Complex Task</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
Because endometriosis may cause so many fertility problems-anovulation,
luteal phase defect, adhesions, tubal blockage, ectopic pregnancies, and idiopathic (unknown) infertility-treating endometriosis can be very complex. I may have to decide if ovulation
induction will work in the presence of the disease; or if the
endometriosis must be treated before trying ovulation induction
therapy. And before even attempting ovulation induction therapy,
I must be relatively certain that adhesions will not
interfere with fertilization or cause an ectopic pregnancy. If
you are at risk for an ectopic pregnancy, medical and endoscopic surgical treatment
may significantly reduce your risks for this complication.
<P>
After I perform surgery to remove endometrial implants, clear
adhesions, and perform tubal repairs, I must reassess your fertility
potential. Together we can explore the post surgical treatment options below and develop a plan that best meets your needs.  <oL>
<LI>Expectant management (wait & see)<p>
<LI>Ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination<p>
<LI>In vitro fertilization</oL><p>

<B>Where to find help</B>
<p>
I strongly advise you to consult with a fellowship trained reproductive endocrinologist(RE)who can offer the full range of treatment infertility options as well as provide you with <I>state of the art</I> surgical treatment. By consulting with an RE, you may learn that in vitro fertilization or superovulation and intrauterine insemination will provide a better opportunity for success and than surgery. However, if surgery is necessary, your procedure will be performed by a skilled endoscopist best trained to protect your future fertility<p>

Fortunately there are many ways to solve these problems and get
all of your systems working in perfect harmony so you will have
your chance at making a baby-the greatest miracle of all.
