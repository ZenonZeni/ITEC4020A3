The Philippines is the "hottest of the <A HREF="../hotspots/hotspots.htm">hot spots</A>," with extremely high terrestrial and marine diversity facing a very high rate of ecological destruction.  
 With more than 95 percent of primary
forest already degraded, and many marine ecosystems under threat,
CI and partners seek to address the continued pressures from development
and agricultural expansion, as well as illegal logging and fishing.
 In the Philippines, CI's experience in conservation planning,
scientific research, and enterprise development are united with
Philippine institutions' on-the-ground expertise.

 CI
works jointly with Isabela State University, the Center for Tropical
Forest Studies and with fellow members of the Northern Sierra
Madre Wilderness Foundation consortium on the conservation this
national protected area, the largest remaining block of lowland
rain forest in the Philippines.  Activities include forest ecological
research as part of a regionwide network of sites measuring growth
rate, disturbances, weather effects on tropical habitats.  The
project also explores enterprise development including ecotourism
services training for community members, and institutional development
for promoting community-based natural resource management.

<H4>Tubbataha
Reefs National Marine Park</H4>

<P>
 CI has consolidated partnerships in
this World Heritage site, opening a new office in the Palawan
provincial capital and chairing the Science Committee of the Presidential
Task Force for Tubbataha.  With the Tubbataha Foundation, CI has
worked with nearby communities on potential economic alternatives
to illegal fishing in the park, and engaged in visitor and community
environmental education and outreach.  [CI will expand activities
in Palawan, a conservation priority also for its terrestrial ecosystems,
coordinating closely with the Philippine Council for Sustainable
Development and the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement.]</BLOCKQUOTE>
