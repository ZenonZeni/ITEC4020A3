<img src="stonesoftgrn.gif"align=left>Now you can increase lab productivity,<br> expand 
existing resources,<br> and lower costs 
with <a href="http://www.varian.com/chroma/starlims.html">StarLIMS 7.0.</A><br>  New from 
the ground up,<br> this Laboratory Information <br>
Management Software incorporates <br>over ten years of Varian's practical <br>experience 
with over
 235 StarLIMS <br>installations around the world.  <br>Offering labs a totally user 
 definable database <br>structure, StarLIMS is adaptable to virtually <br>any lab 
 requirement or environment.<P>
<img src="stonebullet.gif"><strong>NEW! SQL-based client/server architecture.</strong>  
StarLIMS 
lets you choose the computing environment that meets your needs today with the 
flexibility to expand tomorrow.  The software works with Oracle7, Sybase System 
10, Microsoft SQL Server and Watcom SQL Server databases which run on numerous 
hardware platforms such as PCs, RISC workstations, minicomputers, and mainframes.  
Current network operating systems include UNIX, Windows NT Server, and Novell.<P>

<a href="http://www.varian.com/inst/catalog/spex.htm"><img src="elut.gif" align=left></A><img src="stonebullet.gif"><strong>NEW! StarLIMS' object-oriented technology. </strong> 
Save money by customizing StarLIMS to reuse Windows-based software objects 
(standard software modules) instead of programming new ones. StarLIMS lets you 
add new objects and includes built-in software objects that let you build
custom sample login screens, results entry screens, approval screens and more.<P>

<img src="stonebullet.gif"><strong>NEW! Five lab-specific options.</strong>  Included 
with version 7.0 are StarLIMS' newest options: Scheduled Sample Login for 
continuous process, power, and water/waste industries;  Batch Tree Management 
for the food, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries;  Customer Specification 
and Material Inventory for all manufacturing industries;  Analyst Certification 
and Training Management, and  Lab Supplies Inventory Management, both for all 
types of labs. These options have been added to the existing Stability Study, 
Blending and Formulation, and Financial Applications options.<P>

<img src="stonebullet.gif"><strong>NEW! Windows 95 Interface.</strong> StarLIMS 7.0 
features a native graphical user interface for Windows 95 and Windows 3.x. Windows 
NT support to follow initial shipments. <P>

<img src="stonebullet.gif"><strong>EXPERIENCE. Only from Varian.</strong>  Put 
Varian's LIMS experience to work for you.  From information managmentment to 
operations management, StarLIMS is the last word in laboratory handling.<P>	<hr noshade><P>

<img src="improve.gif"align=left>
Varian has pulled out all the stops to make the latest<br> revision of the Star 
Chromatography Workstation <br>meet the heavy data acquisition demands of busy 
labs.<br>
  
<a href="http://www.varian.com/inst/chromo/star45-1.htm">Version 4.5</A>, targeted 
for release in February 1996,<br> has major enhancements that 
will improve <br>lab productivity.  The Workstation upgrades provide<br> users with new 
Interactive Graphics tools for <br>analyzing chromatograms.  Simplifications to <br>the 
user interface reduce training <br>time and eliminate costly sample rework.<P>
<H4>Interactive Graphics</h4>
The new Interactive Graphics software has been redesigned for graphical method 
building.  Graphical placement of key data handling events makes for a more 
intuitive approach to method setup.  With the new graphics software, it's 
possible to change signal to noise or peak integration controls with a click 
of the mouse.  These features help busy laboratories speed up method development.  
Beyond changes to the user interface, the data handling software has been expanded 
and improved to give state of the art control of peak processing and instrument 
calibration.  The better data handling will cut down time spent on sample rework.<P>
<h4>Easy to Use</H4>	 
Version 4.5 has significant improvements in the ease of use category as well.  
A simplified Single Point Calibration interface greatly simplifies calibrations 
in this mode of operation.  Organizing the sample data is now a snap,  since the 
data directory path is in the sample list. The entire instrument startup process 
has been streamlined to cut operator training time.  Designed for seamless control 
of Varian GC and LC instruments, Version 4.5 is the only data system offering 
customers automated control of Solid Phase MicroExtraction (SPME), the 1078 
injector, Fast GC, and the PolyChrom Diode Array Detector.  Version 4.5 will 
also expand its GLP compliance features to add tracking of column and LC module 
data.<P>

Version 4.5 has been written so that is compatible both with Windows 95 and 
Windows 3.1 or <br>Windows for Workgroups. <P>

<h4>Where:</H4> Pleasanton, CA USA<br>
<h4>Who:</h4> Pierre Monette, Vice President</BR>
<h4>Problem:</h4> "We were choking on paperwork!" The<br>
lab was had typing approximately 500 reports<br>
for 5000 samples a mont. "With a 1% error<br>
rate, we were losing our credibility."<br>
<h4>Solution:</h4> Purchase of Varian <a href="http://www.varian.com/chroma/
starlims.html">StarLIMS</A> in December, 1993.<br>
<h4>Result:</h4> Lab productivity and accuracy have<br>
increased tenfold so that "StarLIMS has become the heart<br>
of our lab." All aspects of the operation, from sample login<br>
to electronic deliverables, are controlled by<br>
StarLIMS. Flexible software allows the lab to create<br>
unique management reports to suit needs of individual<br>
clients. ChromaLab has seized the technological advantage<br>
and has increased its sales by 20% in the last three years!<P><hr noshade><P>

Do you run multiple methods on a single HPLC system?  Do you find yourself 
continually changing columns and solvents to tailor the system to your changing 
needs? Imagine being able to run a batch of samples overnight by six different 
methods, each with its own unique column and set of HPLC conditions.  Using 
Varian's column and solvent selection system, the imaginable is now possible.  
Instead of manually changing solvents and columns, you can easily select the ones 
you need directly from the keypad on the pump.  Or use Varian's Star Workstation 
to automatically program solvent and column switching for the ultimate in 
unattended automation.<P>
<img src="valvesm.gif" align=right>Solvent selection allows the chromatographer 
to select any one of eight different solvents as mobile phases in either isocratic 
or gradient mode.  Column selection allows the chromatographer to automatically 
select one of six different columns already connected to the HPLC system.  No 
more hassles of constantly making and breaking column connections or of changing 
solvents on the pump.<P>  
Using the contact closures on the <a href="http://www.varian.com/chroma/lcpumps.html#101">
9012 pump</A>, you can select the solvents and 
column you need by setting the contact closures either on the keypad of the pump 
or from the Star Workstation via a click of the mouse.  And, since Varian's Star 
LC modules are easily automated, you can switch solvents and columns in advance 
of the run, leaving the system totally unattended.<P>
Whether your lab does routine Quality Control, Method Development or Research, 
you can benefit from the ability to program solvent and column switching.  See 
your productivity soar!  <P>
Contact your Varian Sales Representative now and find out how you can turn your 
HPLC system into a productivity workhorse in your lab!  <P><hr><P>

	Saturn GC/MS systems are renowned for unsurpassed detectivity in all modes 
of operation: EI, CI, MS and MS/MS.  But to take full advantage of that 
performance, the system has to maintain optimal chromatographic peak shape 
for all analytes--from a nonpolar hydrocarbon 
to the most polar drug.  Two 
new upgrades will help Saturn users meet that goal.  The new 
<a href="http://www.varian.com/chroma/gcinjectors.html#100">1078 injector,</A> with 
its three modes of operation--split, splitless, and temperature ramped splitless-- 
delivers improved inertness in all injection techniques and is available as 
a cost effective upgrade to your 1077 injector body.<P>
	In January 1996, <a href="http://www.varian.com/chroma/gcmstech.html#100">Saturn</A> will begin shipments of the latest advance in ion 
trap surface technology-SilChrom ion traps.  Available as an upgrade, SilChrom 
(patent pending) guarantees inertness with a layer of both chromium and 
fused silica.  Combined with the 1078 and a good fused silica column, 
SilChrom delivers the sharp, symmetrical peaks you need for even the most 
demanding compounds. <P>
