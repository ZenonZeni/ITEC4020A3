<h3>Encryption Experts Call For Much Longer Key Lengths</h3>
<p>
Seven leading experts on cryptography have released a joint report arguing that dramatically stronger encryption is needed to provide adequate privacy and security for computer users. The study calls for the deployment of 75- to 90-bit key length encryption systems, in contrast to the 40-bit systems currently exportable under Administration policies.
<p>
The report, <a href = "http://www.bsa.org/bsa/cryptologists.html">"Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers to Provide Adequate Commercial Security"</a> was written by cryptography and computer security experts Matt Blaze, Whitfield Diffie, Ronald Rivest, Bruce Schnier, Tsutomo Shimomura, Eric Thompson, and Michael Weiner.
<p>
The study joins the mounting body of evidence showing that products exportable under the Clinton Administration's encryption policies do not provide adequate privacy and security.  The report argues that computer products with 40-bit encryption keys "offer virtually no protection at this point" from brute force attacks. "To provide adequate protection against the most serious threats... keys used to protect data today should be at least 75 bits long. To protect information adequately for the next 20 years .... keys in newly-deployed systems should be at least 90 bits long."  <font size = -1>Feb. 1996</font>

<h3>CEO's Criticize Encryption Export Policies, Warn of Economic Harm</h3>

The CEO's of 13 large technology companies published a highly critical report outlining the dangers of current U.S. encryption export control policies.  <a href = "http://www.podesta.com/cspp/reports/report1-96.html">"Perspectives On Security In The Information Age,"</a> by the Computer Systems Policy Project, finds that U.S. information industries could lose $30 to $60 billion in annual revenues by the year 2000 due to export controls.  <font size = -1>Jan. 1996</font>
