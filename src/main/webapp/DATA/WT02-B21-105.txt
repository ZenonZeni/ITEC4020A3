16 November - 22 December 1997<BR>
On board the Kapitan Khlebnikov<BR>
37 tour days</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Dear Adventurer,</FONT></B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysteries concerning the Antarctic Continent are innumerable. What is this compelling lure which beckons us to return to a frozen wonderland? Is it the many indelible memories we retain of ever-changing icescapes, majestic snow-capped mountains, and brilliant blue icebergs, those immense galleons of ice which sail the Southern Ocean? Or is it the wildlife, an incomparable celebration of all creatures great and small, from comical, waddling penguins to the largest creatures the Earth has ever fostered, the great whales? Perhaps it is just the sight of a squadron of albatrosses following in the ship's wake. Whatever the attraction is, whatever the yearning that pulls each of us southwards, it is real, yet intangible, and has beckoned other polar explorers before us.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite having been to Antarctica so many times over the last 15 years of expedition travel, we seldom have an opportunity to travel to a completely new part of the great white continent. With this in mind, we have designed aunique Antarctic program - Antarctica - The Far Side, which does just that. This will be an opportunity to explore an entirely new region of the last wilderness on Planet Earth. It will be an Antarctic expedition like no other.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pilgrimage begins in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and heads south through the Indian Ocean, making stops at Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, and Heard Islands. Only a few hundred mortals have reached these distant sub-Antarctic outposts. Each island is different in character, yet each is a bastion of wildlife, literally overflowing with penguins, albatrosses, and seals.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes the ice...lots of it. During the following 11 days of this incredible expedition to Antarctica, we plan to visit as many emperor penguin rookeries as possible. Each of these rookeries possesses a distinctively unique setting, each with their own spectacular backdrops of icebergs, sea ice, and glaciers. Photographic and viewing opportunities will be limited only by our own individual stamina. Expect sensory overload as the early morning sun transforms everything black and white to luminous shades of ebony, gold, and ivory. To stand within an emperor penguin rookery surrounded by a maze of immense tabular icebergs beset in mile after mile of endless ice is simply without equal.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our journey of Antarctic exploration will take us beyond emperor penguin rookeries as we plan to visit Australia's Mawson Base and Davis Base, as well as Russia's Mirny Base. Also on our wish list are the Scullin and Murray Monoliths.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, an expedition of this nature would have been impossible. However, with the recent availability of powerful, state-of-the-art Russian icebreakers, a journey of this magnitude is no longer merely a dream. In addition to a fleet of go-anywhere Zodiac landing craft, our icebreaker, the Kapitan Khlebnikov, is equipped with two helicopters. These will be used not only for ice reconnaissance and flight-seeing excursions, but also to transfer us quickly ashore to areas which would otherwise be inaccessible.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our 37-day voyage of pure Antarctic adventure and exploration will end at Fremantle, Western Australia. If you desire to be among the few privileged travelers to undertake an historic journey of discovery, we invite you to sail with us as we explore Antarctica - The Far Side.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Itinerary</FONT><BR>
16 November 1997<BR>
New York</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We gather this evening at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York for our flight to Johannesburg, South Africa.<BR>
<B>17 November<BR>
Johannesburg / Port Elizabeth</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrive in Johannesburg this afternoon and connect with our flight to Port Elizabeth. Upon arrival, we transfer to our hotel for dinner and overnight accommodation.<BR>
<B>18 November<BR>
Port Elizabeth</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning is at leisure to explore this bustling coastal city or relax by the pool. After lunch at the hotel, we have a sightseeing tour of the city and the surrounding area. Port Elizabeth offers visitors a rich history and a temperate climate. Much of the city's initial develop-ment as a harbor came from the export of wool and mohair from the drier interior where the settlers cross bred flat-tailed Cape sheep with imported German merinos for a superior quality of wool. The wool market is still centered in the city, but the development of more modern industries have now become the focal point of the local economy. We return to the hotel in time for dinner and overnight.<BR>
<B>19 November<BR>
Port Elizabeth / Sail for Antarctica</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breakfast at our hotel, we transfer to the Kapitan Khlebnikov for embarkation. We begin to settle in to our temporary homes for the next 34 days. After lunch on board, we sail out of Port Elizabeth Harbor like so many of the early Antarctic expeditions of discovery. We will retrace the footsteps of legendary explorers and plan to make new discoveries of our own. Spend the afternoon strolling the spacious decks of our powerful icebreaker, keeping our eyes peeled for seabirds and marine life. <BR>
<B>20-21 November<BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we cruise these historic waters, our lecturers introduce the various species of birds and marine life which we will encounter on our voyage. Our historian will begin to recount the many tales of heroic Antarctic history relevant to these waters. As we make our way south towards the continent of Antarctica, expect to see wandering, royal, shy, yellow-nosed, and black-browed albatrosses; jackass penguins; Salvin's prions; little, manx, and Cory's shearwaters; soft plumaged, Kerguelen, and great-winged petrels as they glide in our ship's wake. <BR>
<B>22 November<BR>
Marion Island</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possibility of a landing or a Zodiac excursion here is pending final permission from the South African authorities governing the island.<BR>
<B>23 November<BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we continue to sail south, we enter the cooler waters of the Southern Indian Ocean. Our naturalists will be on deck to help spot and identify the seabirds and marine mammals that are indigenous to these waters. We have a chance to photograph the magnificent wandering albatross, prions, cape pigeons and petrels, including northern giant petrels.<BR>
<B>24 - 25 November<BR>
Crozet Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These islands, which are a French protectorate, offer truly extraordinary scenery, as well as abundant and varied wildlife. Our shore landings allow us ample time to explore and experience the beauty of these islands and take in the prolific wildlife found on these sub-Antarctic islands. We visit a large colony of majestic king penguins, whose young chicks are still fledging their brown fluffy down. Other penguins we encounter include macaronis, gentoos and rockhoppers. Of special interest to the birders will be lesser or black-faced sheathbills and the endemic resident shags. We meander among wandering and light mantled sooty albatrosses, the latter on their nests. Molting elephant seals add their unique sounds and smells to the amazing wildlife display.<BR>
<B>26 - 27 November<BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lecture series continues as we proceed south toward the Kerguelen Islands. Join our naturalists on deck to help identify the new species of seabirds following in our wake including; Salvin's and gray-headed albatrosses, southern giant petrels, pintado, grey, white-chinned, diving, and black-bellied storm petrels. As always, we keep our eyes peeled for whales and other sea mammals.<BR>
<B>28 - 29 November<BR>
Kerguelen Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our exact landing sights will be determined by prevailing sea and weather conditions at the time of our arrival. The diversity of penguin species on these islands is astounding. Penguin rookeries include gentoo, king, macaroni, and rockhopper, and perhaps even a few royal penguins, many with newly hatched chicks, others still incubating their eggs. We observe - from a safe distance - the Kerguelen fur seals - the aggressive sparring males, the subdued females and the adorable newly-born pups playfully bounding through the tussock grass - never straying too far from their mothers. Seabirds are also found here in abundance including; albatrosses, giant petrels, skuas, sheathbills, kelp gulls, the Kerguelen tern and endemic shag. We plan to visit the French Base, Port-aux-Francais, a station manned year round by 100 researchers and scientists.<BR>
<B>30 November - 01 December<BR>
Heard Island</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another wildlife rich sub-Antarctic island. Heard boasts spectacular mountainous scenery - the skyline of which is dominated by Big Ben, a 9,005 foot glacier and snow capped volcanic mountain, active as recently as 1993. The unique rock formations, molded by lava flows, provide our on board geologist with wonderful demonstrative examples of the effects of volcanic activity. For the more agile among us, and if weather conditions allow, we may attempt a &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; hike on the volcano to achieve a spectacular panoramic view from above. The island boasts nesting albatrosses, petrels, the Kerguelen blue-eyed shag and rockhopper penguins nesting along the sheer cliff face. King, Macaroni and gentoo penguins add to this wildlife spectacle. Bellowing elephant seals and aggressive fur seals can be found along the island's shorelines. Perhaps we can spot leopard seals patrolling off shore in search of their next meal.<BR>
<B>02 - 04 December<BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we continue further south, we begin to scan the horizon for the first icebergs of our voyage - the best indicator that we are approaching the icy realm of Antarctica. We cross the Antarctic convergence - the official scientific boundary of the Antarctic - into the cooler waters of the Southern Ocean. The outside temperatures will also be dropping as we proceed south. Antarctic and snow petrels wheel in the ship's wake. We arrive at the edge of the pack ice and are greeted by a vast, serene white expanse of sea ice. Be on the lookout for the rare Ross' seal and our first emperor penguins catching a ride on the ice floes. Our powerful vessel will show her true mettle as she crushes through the pack ice. If the weather is in our favor, we take to the skies for helicopter sight-seeing flights to view our icebreaker at work. Large icebergs, recently calved off of the Antarctic ice shelves, will become more frequent.<BR>
<B>05 - 15 December<BR>
Antarctic Continent</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following eleven days will be spent exploring the Antarctic Coastline. Because of the nature of this polar expedition, flexibility with regard to the daily schedule of activities is a must. If the weather is in our favor, we may schedule landings at any hour of the day or night. Our main objective will be to locate wildlife which is found here in abundance during the short summer season. Weather, ice and sea conditions will determine our exact itinerary. The following are possible landing sites listed in order from West to East:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Kloa Point Emperor Penguin Rookery</B> Located near the Australian Mawson Base, set against a beautiful backdrop of rock and grounded icebergs. Walk amongst the curious penguins and observe the ritual of parent / chick identification and feeding after the adults have returned from sea. We marvel at the &quot;Emperor Superhighway&quot; created by the penguins as they toboggan on their bellies across the frozen sea ice to the open ocean. There may even be a few Adelie penguins interspersed with the emperors. An unearthly sound can be heard below the ice and then a Weddell seal unexpectedly pops his delightful round face through the sea ice in an attempt to keep his breathing hole open.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mawson Base</B> Mawson is the oldest of the Australian bases and is manned year round by some 20 researchers and scien-tists. Mawson is the earliest continuously operating station on the Antarctic Conti-nent, established in 1954. Pending final permission, we are treated to a tour of the station and learn more about the research carried out here. The islands nearby provide summer breeding grounds for Adelie penguins - the southernmost dwelling penguin in the world. An Adelie rookery is a bustling hectic contrast to an emperor rookery, but an outstanding experience all the same.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Auster Emperor Penguin Rookery</B> This rookery is also located near Mawson Base, and boasts another stunning setting encircled by magnificent grounded icebergs in colors from pure white to an iridescent blue. Silently we sit and watch as these regal birds feed their chicks, preen their shining coats, stroll to and from the rookery or just quietly stand watching us watch them. This spectacle is a photographers dream, although equally awe-inspiring for those who just wish to immerse themselves in the beautiful serenity of the Antarctic - another world.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Scullin Monolith</B> A large prominent rock outcrop along the ice-bound coast, it is a site of prolific wildlife and outstanding scenery. Scullin boasts one of the largest seabird colonies in Antarctica; including the largest colony of Antarctic petrels in the world, with over 150,000 breeding pairs. Also present are a variety of other seabirds including fulmars, cape pigeons, skuas and snow petrels, nesting in the crevices of the cliff. The spectacle of thousands of birds seen wheeling overhead is simply staggering. Large numbers of Adelie penguins occupy the lower levels of the monolith and Weddell seals gather along the coast. If weather allows, we make helicopter landings on the monolith itself. From our landing site, we climb up as high as the summit and are rewarded by our efforts with breathtaking views from the top.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Murray Monolith</B> Four miles to the east of Scullin, Murray is another large rock jutting out of the icesheet. There is a large Adelie penguin rookery dotting the high ice-free slopes. The penguins have created a vertical freeway to and from the ocean. Once in the sea, they shoot out of the water onto the nearby ice floes before lining up like soldiers before they re-enter the icy deep. Courting snow petrels; calling and flapping their wings - demonstrate their rituals - a very romantic display. A nearby glacier cascading down toward the frozen ocean provides a scenic backdrop to the entire scene.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Amery Ice Shelf</B> This area is known for the spectacular icebergs which have recently calved off of the nearby ice shelf. Massive tabular bergs intermingle with various smaller, intricately carved icebergs, a result of the constant erosion caused by the relentless Antarctic elements. The Amery Ice Shelf is a huge expanse of floating ice with ice cliffs over 100 feet high. The shelf is the seaboard drainage of the world's largest glacier, the Lambert Glacier. More than 8.4 cubic miles of ice are discharged each year through this vast glacier system. If weather conditions allow, we take to the skies for a bird's eye view of this fantastic bay of icebergs from the comfortable perch of our on-board helicopters.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Flutter Emperor Penguin Rookery</B> This rookery is located further into the pack ice with grounded icebergs providing the penguins with shelter from the wind. A landing here is dependent on how close our powerful ice breaker can bring us to the colony. As this rookery is situated further from the ice edge, the chicks here will likely be smaller than at the previous rookeries we have visited. Although the chicks are adorable, their small size this late in the season is an indicator that many may not molt in time to go to sea with the adults and more developed chicks.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Larsemann Hills</B> There are several research stations located in the vicinity of Larsemann Hills including: Zhong Chan Base, the Chinese station; the recently closed Russian Bases, Progress I and II; as well as the Australian summer Law Base. Grounded tabular icebergs are strewn about the sea. Weddell seals peek through the ice and haul their enormous weight out onto the ice for a bit of sun bathing. We walk amongst their breathing holes and admire the various shapes and colors of the sculpted icebergs.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Amanda Bay - Emperor Penguin Rookery</B> This is another breathtaking setting, as the emperors breed at the foot of gigantic grounded icebergs, in the lee of the wind. We again marvel at the &quot;Feeding Freeway&quot; caused by the trail of the tobogganing penguins as they trek to and from the open sea to feed. We may also find Adelie penguins, distant relatives of the emperors, in this area.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Davis Station</B> Another Australian base where, time permitting, we are treated to tours by personnel who occupy the base year round. We are shown their scientific laboratories and discover more about the research done at this base. We also find out what it is like to spend a dark and cold winter in the Antarctic.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearby <B>Vestfold Hills</B> is a remarkable expanse of rounded rock coastal hills, jutting from the frozen continent 200 square miles. The hills are heavily indented by fjords (some of them covered with fast ice) and many lakes. Large Weddell seal populations gather in the long fjords. We listen for their unearthly underwater call and search for their tell tale breathing holes.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the vicinity, we find Adelie penguin rookeries on <B>Lucas Island</B> and <B>Rookery Island</B>. We watch the Adelies as they steal each other's nesting stones. The stones are a very hot commodity in an Adelie rookery and if they are not guarded carefully, they will soon disappear. Curious and active, with quick and unpredictable movements - the Adelies are a complete contrast to the graceful and elegant emperors, but very entertaining to watch. Leopard seals can be spotted cruising the ice edge, laying in wait for a careless Adelie.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Gaussberg</B> Discovered by German geographer Erich von Drygalski in 1902, during an overwintering expedition, this extinct volcanic cone, located at the coastal end of the huge West Ice Shelf, juts 270 meters into the air. This is an area of interesting scenic delights and weather permitting, we plan to make landings here on the continent.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mirny Base</B> is one of Russia's large Antarctic bases. This was the first Russian base in Antarctica, established in 1955 and currently manned year round. A tour will show us the research carried out here and we note the contrasts to the other stations we have visited. We can look forward to a very gracious welcome as we are traveling aboard a vessel sailing under the Russian flag. The nearby islands are inhabited by breeding Adelie penguins and Weddell seals sunning themselves on the fast ice.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Bowman Island </B>This island marks the furthest east point of our voyage before we head north toward Australia. A high ice-covered island about 24 miles long and from 2 to 6 miles wide, it is shaped like a figure eight.<BR>
<B>16 - 21 December<BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we make our way north, our naturalists and lecturers recap the amazing sights and sounds we have experienced over the past few weeks. Are there words to describe this wondrous spectacle? From the decks of our sturdy vessel, we watch the seabirds trailing in our wake - white-chinned petrels, wandering albatrosses, prions, soft plumaged petrels, black-browed albatrosses, light-mantled sooty albatrosses, and gray-headed albatrosses all may be seen.<BR>
<B>22 December<BR>
