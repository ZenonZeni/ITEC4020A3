<p><strong>WARREN, Ohio</strong> - Unions across three states are raising
money 
and mobilizing their members to bring holiday joy to the 
families of some 4,500 members of five Steelworkers union 
locals who have been on strike against Wheeling-Pittsburgh 
Steel since Oct. 1.</p>

<p>Jerry Hartshorn, secretary of the grievance committee at 
Steelworkers Local 1375 here, said the local had filled 
three buses by midweek. "And we're taking $5,000 with us." 
Hartshorn told the World that $4,300 was collected at the 
plant gate of the Warren Consolidated Industries steel mill. 
"The local threw in enough to make it an even $5,000," he 
said.</p>

<p>Pointing to the victory that forced Bridgestone/Firestone to 
come to terms with the USWA after a bitter 27-month strike 
and lockout, Hartshorn said "W-P is the next battle the 
union has to win. We did it at Ravenswood Aluminum and here 
at WCI and we can do it there."</p>

<p>W-P forced the strike when management refused to fulfill its 
promise to reestablish a defined benefits pension plan and 
instead gave the union a "last, best and final" offer that 
would have allowed the company to gut insurance coverage and 
totally eliminate seniority, craft and contracting out 
protection.</p>

<p>On Dec. 4 the USWA sent a letter to the company reaffirming 
its willingness to resume negotiations "any time and 
anywhere" Wheeling Pitt "shows up willing to reach an 
agreement that does not destroy our union, does not gut our 
insurance program ... and does not line the already 
overflowing pockets of the vultures who control Wheeling-
Pittsburgh ..."</p>

<p>When informed of the plans of Local 1375, Jim King said USWA 
Local 1104 in Lorain, Ohio, had raised more than $2,000 in a 
plant gate collection and would be sending people to the 
Holiday Solidarity Rally in Steubenville, Ohio on Sunday 
afternoon, Dec. 22. He added that the "partnership" 
agreements that the union had signed with several 
steelmakers "may have weakened our ability to fight back."</p>

<p>King, who heads up the local's volunteer organizing 
committee, said the Wheeling-Pitt strike was a "very 
important strike" that the union "just had to win."</p>

<p>Steve Hega, vice-president of Local 1187, told the World 
that although pensions were important, "the other points are 
just as important. We just couldn't accept their offer."</p>

<p>Hega said Local 1187 pickets Wheeling-Pitt headquarters at 
least once a week. "We fill a bus and a couple of cars and 
go down there and hand out leaflets," Hega said.</p>

<p>Last week the union decided to change its tactics and sent 
union members into the office demanding to see the annual 
stockholder report.</p>

<p>"Every employee who owns even one share of stock has the 
right to see it. In fact, we each got a letter telling us of 
our right - only thing about it is that the print's so fine 
you can't hardly read it. But this year we got out a 
magnifying glass and read it."</p>

<p>When 50 union members entered the company office building 
with the demand to see the books, they were threatened with 
arrest. "But they backed down and we looked at the books," 
Hega said, laughing.</p>

<p>For Frank Ellis, president of the Ohio Valley Trades and 
Labor Assembly of Wheeling, W.Va., every union battle is 
everybody's fight. "We need solidarity - getting all unions 
together to fight back," he said. Then, pointing to the use 
of non-union labor by Wal-Mart, Sam's Club and Kroger to 
build a new shopping center on the Ohio side of the river, 
he said; "The battles at Wheeling-Pitt and to prevent use of 
scab are cut of the same cloth."</p>

<p>According to the USWA, production costs at Wheeling-Pitt are 
about half that of other domestic steelmakers. During a 
normal production day, union members at Wheeling-Pitt ship 
10,000 tons of steel to auto companies, heating and air 
conditioning manufacturers to producers of other steel 
products, including garbage cans.</p>

<p>Union officials point out that even if Wheeling Pitt signs a 
contract bringing its workers' pension into line with the 
rest of the industry, it will remain more profitable that 
other companies. When the strike began, the company had a 
nest egg of more than $400 million.</p>
