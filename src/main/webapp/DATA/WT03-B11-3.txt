MASS APPEAL

Russia's reputation as a tricky place to do business has obscured the
success of its public and privately-owned broadcasters in serving an
increasingly demanding - and massive - audience. Chris Dziadul reports

Russia's embrace of free-market principles since the end of one-party
rule and the thawing of the cold war has not been without
complications. But the well-documented political and economic crises
afflicting the country have tended to overshadow the continued growth
of its tv industry.

Television services in Russia, especially at a local level, are
flourishing, and revenues from tv advertising - which only came into
existence in 1990 - now exceed $500 million a year.

In Moscow, viewers have a choice of 11 terrestrial channels including
ORT (formerly the national broadcaster Ostankino), RTR (Russian public
television), 2x2 (a music and entertainment station) and NTV (the
largest independent commercial network in the country), along with the
U.S.-backed microwave operator Kosmos TV. In St Petersburg the choice
is the same if not even greater thanks to the city's proximity to the
Nordic countries. Even some of Russia's remotest cities are now served
by local stations, and one (Nika TV in Petrozavorsk) boasts one of the
most sophisticated cable networks in the country.

Russia's two national publicly-owned broadcasters, ORT (Channel 1) and
RTR (Channel 2), are both having to adjust to the needs of an
increasingly selective tv audience. RTR, which can be received by 92.2%
of the population and almost four-fifths of the inhabitants of the
former Soviet Union - effectively 300 million people - was launched in
May 1991.

RTR shows a variety of programming ranging from the highly popular
Vesti news bulletin (regularly watched by two-thirds of all Russian
viewers) to Santa Barbara. Partly-privatized ORT, on the other hand,
took over the functions of Ostankino when it was declared bankrupt in
early 1995 and covers the entire area of the former Soviet Union.

While ORT is still in a transitional phase, RTR has decided to embark
on an ambitious plan to launch the country's first digital satellite-
delivered tv package. A joint venture with an undisclosed UK company -
Network, it will, according to deputy chairman and director of this
March or April. Beaming from a transponder on Intelsat 604, the
channels will reach a potential audience of 40 million "collective
customers" served by cable systems throughout the former Soviet Union.
The start up costs for equipment alone are likely to be between $10-15
be added to the package in the near future.

Bunevich feels the service will introduce viewers to the idea of paying
for their programming and alleviate RTR's financial problems. Although
the broadcaster currently earns around 15% of its income from
advertising, the remainder is obtained from the government, and up to
75% of its total revenue is paid directly to the ministry of
telecommunications for the use of its transmission facilities. While
RTR is likely to remain a state holding company, it will in the future
probably undertake all of its entrepreneurial activities through a
group of daughter companies.

The most successful of the privately-owned broadcasting ventures has
been the NTV television company. Backed by three major Moscow banks
(Most-bank, Stolichny and Natsionalny Kredit), it was given official
approval by President Boris Yeltsin in October 1993, became fully self-
supporting in mid-1995 and currently - through having airtime on the
near-national Channel 4 (which it shares with 2x2) and affiliates in
seven locations including St Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Rostov-on-
Don - reaches an estimated 102 million viewers in 168 towns and cities
in Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus.

NTV has built up a reputation for strong and independent news
reporting, with two of its three daily newscasts (Segodnya at 7pm and
10pm) regularly achieving a 34% audience share and the midnight news
(Segodnya v polnoch) peaking at 45%. Itogi, a weekly news and current
affairs program, also scores consistently high ratings.

The station in addition allocates 53% of its airtime to high-quality
films and each week carries eight foreign and three Russian movies,
along with six hours of serial telefilms. According to Andrei
Golovanov, its head of international relations and acquisitions, it has
agreements with over 30 distributors including Warner Bros, MCA, MGM
and 20th Century Fox and has been the first channel in the country to
air such movies as Jaws, The Deer Hunter and Silence of the Lambs.

Although NTV currently acquires almost all of its programming, it has
started to co-produce a 30 x half-hour series of documentaries named
Criminal Russia with a U.S. company and is "also considering some other
offers." In Golovanov's view, its success has been built on independent
news, a good selection of movies and working efficiently "without too
much bureaucracy." For this to continue, however, it may have to
increase its Russian output as "people are becoming tired of western
programs."

It is at a regional and local level, however, that the greatest
activity in Russian broadcasting is currently taking place. There are
currently several dozen stations (out of some 3,000 non-governmental
independent services around the country) operating on this basis which
started out three to four years ago as little more than pirates but
have since matured into highly professional organisations. Their
numbers include Skat TV (in Samara), Tomsk TV (Tomsk) and Afontovo,
which operates two TV channels and a radio station in the far eastern
city of Krasnoyarsk.

Several of these broadcasters have teamed up to create associations,
which have in turn developed into loose horizontal networks. One of
these (the 126-member Nezavisimaya Veschatelnaya Sistema - NVS) started
off in mid-1994 exchanging 26 minutes a week of programming including
news, tv movies, series and soaps and has since increased this to four
hours daily. Run on a co-operative basis, it has a potential audience
of 80 million and is seen by many as a potential rival to NTV.

The driving force behind such projects is Internews, an international
non-profit organization founded in the U.S. in 1981 which supports
independent television in newly-emerging democracies. Its activities in
the former Soviet Union, which date back to U.S.-Soviet "space bridges"
in the 1980s which brought people together face-to-face by satellite,
now include the Russian-American Media Partnerships Program (RAMP) and
Open Skies.

According to Grigory Libergal, Internews' programming director, Open
Skies was launched in January 1995 with aid from the Soros Foundation
and provides one hour of documentaries a day free of charge to all
stations willing to take part on condition that they respect copyright.
Some of the programming is produced by Internews itself and the number
of stations participating in the scheme throughout the former Soviet
Union has grown from 45 to over 180. During 1996 the service will be
restructured to offer more specials, series and retrospectives, with
airtime at weekends being increased to two 90-minute slots.

Internews has also operated a news exchange scheme called Local Time
since 1993. While at first also involving broadcasters in the Ukraine,
Belarus and Central Asia who have since gone on to run their own
versions, this is now a wholly Russian service which brings together
some 60 independent stations from around the country. Most file news
reports to Internews' head office in Moscow which are then compiled
into a weekly 30-minute show including some foreign items and sent back
to the stations for rebroadcasting.

While some observers may be surprised at the popularity of news
programming in Russia, Bruce Macdonald, the chairman of Moscow-based ad
agency BBDO Marketing, feels the country is "in the middle of a
pendulum swing" and that news will "always be popular and remain so in
a society that moves this fast." In his view, although it has gone
through its "romance" with soaps (Baywatch and Dynasty have both been
hugely successful and Dallas is expected to arrive shortly), the
Russian audience is still enjoying such programs as audience
participation shows purely for their novelty value and at the same time
"yearning for something that is Russian-produced."

Macdonald feels that one of the keys to the future of broadcasting in
Russia is the country's newly-emerging middle class, which although
still small is growing rapidly. The microwave service Kosmos TV, which
offers some 16 foreign satellite channels to 1,500 individual and
institutional subscribers in the capital, was initially aimed at
expatriates but has recently begun to introduce more local programming
including a film channel in recognition of these "new Russians."

Macdonald sees the launch of more national or near-national channels as
a distinct possibility and expects Murdoch to eventually establish a
presence in Russia - which could happen sooner rather than later if
BSkyB links up with the RTR Network. He also predicts tv ad spend -
which in 1995 BBDO estimates will total $486-594 million - should rise
by between 25-40% per year compared to the levels of 4-5% more common
in western Europe.

However, there are some worrying trends in an industry that was rocked
to the core by the murder of Vladislav Listyev, the general manager of
Ostankino, a year ago. Whereas in 1994 Russian advertisers accounted
for 55% of the total, the figure fell to 30% in 1995 as restrictions on
tobacco and alcohol advertising began to bite and two types of
commercials - financial categories and pyramid schemes - completely
disappeared. "The problems lie in the belief and understanding in
advertising and investment marketing per se," Macdonald said. "While
Russia is a very production-oriented country, consumers have until now
not been a consequence in a market which offered little if any choice."

The Russian advertising industry is currently dominated by two groups
which wholesale ad airtime (Premier SV and Video International) and
several smaller ones including Maxima, InterVID and Ekran-TV who have
to go through them in order to serve broadcasters. While Video
International handles RTR, NTV and 2x2 exclusively, Premier SV jointly
takes care of the accounts of ORT, Channel 5, TV6 (a Moscow station
once part-owned by Turner Broadcasting) and MTK with other wholesalers.

Dina Kalugina, the media director of Young & Rubicam Europe, is upbeat
about the future of television advertising in the country. In her
opinion 1994 was a significant year for the industry as media inflation
stood at an unacceptably high level of 5-7% a month. This has since
stabilized and after the upcoming summer's presidential elections the
market is likely to be boosted by new advertisers. It will also be
helped by a new advertising law which was adopted in July 1995 and
specifies, among other things, the percentage of broadcast time allowed
for commercials.

Kalugina added that current primetime rates range from $12-30,000 and
$19-30,000 per minute on ORT and RTR respectively, while those on such
local channels as 2x2 ($2,500 plus) and TV6 (up to $5,600) are
considerably cheaper. NTV is an exception, however, for although its
rates start as low as $8,000 they shoot up to $28,000 for its weekly
news program.

Kalugina also identifies a problem with programs or advertising blocks
which are pre-empted and replaced either officially or illegally by
local stations' programming. There is lack of information specifying
when these cutoff points occur and advertising blocks placed in between
programs appear to be most at risk.

Furthermore, she believes present programming trends will continue,
with news still drawing large audiences and soaps such as Santa Barbara
(RTR) and Marie Yelena Cassandra (2x2) being popular for a long time.
Sport, on the other hand, will continue to decline in popularity with
Russian viewers.

NEW NET IS WIRED TO THE MAX (AND MACS)

Bang up-to-date technology and its parent group's array of content
could give CNNfn a head start up the I-way...

Once upon a time, about two years ago, broadcasting meant merely
sending program information to those archaic television and radio
devices.

That's not enough anymore. Today a new network ain't a network unless
it's on the network, the Internet. It probably has to be on multiple
computer networks.

At least that's how you might feel after you read about CNN's new
financial network, CNNfn. In what will probably be a model for
broadcast networks of the future, not only will CNNfn be available via
the Galaxy 1R C-Band satellite, DirecTV, Prime Star, Netlink,
Superstar, Time-Warner and others, it will be wired to the max.

Not content with a mere broadcast presence, CNN is bringing out
"distinct but complementary content" on a number of digital networks as
well as the traditional cable and satellite venues. From launch on
December 29, CNNfn has had its own website on the Internet.
Additionally, the CNN and CNNfn website will be accessible from AT&T's
new online service, the AT&T Business Network. Last but not least,
CNNfn will be part of the CNN at Work service developed by CNN and
Intel.

CNNfn is promising initial programming daily from 7 am to 7 pm ET. Its
program offerings will include coverage of the financial markets,
technology and business, personal finance, Washington's impact on
finance, profiles of corporate managers and even tips on handling
stress. Interaction with the online audience (questions and answers
from the web site) call-ins and live remotes will be a big part of
CNNfn's overall modus operandi.

CNNfn has established "inter.face," a computer networked solution that
will allow CNNfn to set up "mini studios" in the offices of financial
managers and advisors, economists, consultants and other players in the
financial world around the country. These camera, monitor and Compaq
computer based teleconferencing set-ups use a proprietary modification
of Intel's Pro-share product to link sites around the country with
CNNfn's New York studio.

Inter.face studios in the offices of companies like Goldman-Sachs,
Merrill Lynch, Ernst and Young and Lehman Brothers will allow CNNfn to
respond immediately to changes in the market and get perspectives from
experts who can be interviewed on the job.

This saves them the trip to a studio for the interview and gets CNNfn
the interview faster than if they had to send out a remote truck. The
teleconferencing data, transferred over MFS Datanet's ATM network, will
be converted and broadcast out of the CNNfn studio.

The CNNfn website, CNNfn.com, will be grabbing content from CNNfn's
broadcast, plus creating additional content for the site, right in the
newsroom. The website will provide multimedia coverage of business
news, follow the U.S. and international markets, provide personal and
corporate financial management tips, disseminate market tips and gossip
and solicit comments and questions from surfers to use on air. Archives
available via the website will include programming information,
transcripts and air schedules of CNNfn and CNN programs, corporate
profiles, a business glossary, stories from Lexis-Nexis and, of course,
links to other sites.

Members of the AT&T Business Network, a dial-up online service, will
have a seamless link to the CNNfn web site. They'll also have exclusive
chat and message boards related to topics and stories on CNNfn.

CNN at Work is CNN's video and print news service for corporations. It
sends Headline News, CNN and CNNfn video over corporate LANs to desktop
PCs in the workplace. It features topic filtering, so you can have the
system look for subjects like "oil." CNN at Work will then grab related
stories from Time, Fortune, Lexis-Nexis and Knight Ridder Financial
News for you. It will alert you whenever stories about oil come up on
the three CNN services and then let you display the video in real-time
or tape it for later viewing.

For now, CNNfn's efforts will be focused on and deployed in the U.S.
There are hopes, but not a definite time table, for expansion to
elsewhere in the world.

All this action puts CNN at the forefront, not only in breadth of
technology, but in the re-purposing of content. Freelance writers have
always tried to resell the same story in different form to multiple
publishers just to survive. For years visionaries on the leading edge
of interactive television have pointed to news coverage as a prime
market. These information technologists have always seen the four hours
of background and additional data that didn't make the two-minute aired
piece as a goldmine. With interactive tv, they said, this additional
footage could be viewed by viewers who "wanted to know more" about any
given story. Obviously, CNN's websites and wired ventures will allow it
to take advantage of this gold mine, in addition to opening up new ways
to create exciting, original online content.

And that's not all. Remember, CNN has an interactive media division as
well. I wouldn't be surprised to see a whole shelf of CNNfn CD-Roms in
my local computer store in the next year or so.

CABLE OPERATORS PLUG IN TO ANALOG SET-TOPS

Though high-speed PC services have displaced video-on-demand as the
cable industry's hot new revenue stream, operators have not given up on
analog tv as a near-term platform for advanced, interactive services.
Jean-Luc Renaud and Mitch Shapiro review an analysis from hardware
manufacturer Scientific-Atlanta.

Anaheim's Western Cable Show made it clear that cable operators and
settop decoder suppliers have begun seriously to explore a strategy
that would use a new generation of "advanced" analog set-top boxes to
deliver limited interactive tv capabilities using on-screen text and
graphics transmitted via the vertical blanking interval (VBI).

These relatively low-cost devices will allow operators to create
"virtual channels" that require neither extra bandwidth nor an
investment in digital video compression.

Among the services that can be supported by advanced analog set-top
boxes are interactive viewing guides (IVGs), enhanced pay-per view
(EPPV) services, interactive advertising, subscriber messaging and text
and graphics-based information channels.

As cable operators have come to realise that near-term revenue streams
cannot justify the cost of digital set-top boxes and the other
components of a VOD system (such as broadband switching, servers and
modulators), many have pushed back their timetables for deployment of
digital set-top equipment.

As this occurs, advanced analog set-tops are emerging as a near-term
alternative to their digital counterparts. Whereas the latter are
expected initially to cost $375-$600, depending upon their
functionality, the former are priced just $25-$60 above the standard
analog converters which cable operators now purchase for $110-$130 per
unit.

According to a paper issued by Scientific Atlanta (S-A), one of the
leading suppliers of cable tv set-tops, "the installed base of advanced
analog set-top boxes in 1995 (in the U.S.) may exceed one million
units, while digital set-tops will be less than 50,000."

The paper, entitled Advanced Analog Systems: Providing Revenue-
Generating Applications for Today's Network Systems, was commissioned
to Probe Research's Gary Kim, described as a long-time observer of the
broadband industry.

In its paper, S-A provided some estimates of the new incremental
revenue streams that might be generated by interactive services running
on advanced analog set-top platforms.

The analysis begins with a pay-per-view business model (Table 1) which
considers three scenarios: low (12,000 subscribers), baseline (15,000)
and high (18,000). Annual operator revenues from PPV (for the average
system) can range from $27,000 to more than $133,000. But operators can
make more money through making PPV "more innovative."

The S-A analysis considered low, baseline and high estimates for an
interactive guide business and for two versions of a "virtual channel"
information service: the first funded by advertisers, the second funded
by subscriber fees.

The types of content that might be delivered via virtual channel
information services, the paper suggests, include news summaries,
weather, traffic, sports, financial information, local event listings,
restaurant menus/delivery, lottery results, health tips and community
events.

Scientific-Atlanta's analysis considers three combinations of IVG
penetration and pricing (Table 2). The "low" revenue model assumes 30%
penetration and a monthly subscriber fee of $0.50. The figures for the
"base case" and "high" estimates are 50%/$1.00 and 80%/$1.95,
respectively.

For all three scenarios, it is assumed that a cable operator would keep
90% of IVG fees, passing on 10% to the provider of program schedule
data. Based on these assumptions, per-subscriber annual revenues in the
three scenarios are: $1.62 (low), $5.40 (base) and $16.85 (high).

The advertiser-funded virtual-channel model (Table 3) is considered
next. In this model, the advertiser provides content and sponsorship.
The network operator's advertising sales department sells the virtual
channel, just as it sells "local avails" now. "From the advertiser's
perspective, this is a strong vehicle for target marketing, is less
expensive to deliver than traditional advertising and marks the
advertiser as an early adopter of technology," argues the S-A paper.

The model considers three monthly prices an advertiser might pay for
each sponsored virtual channel: $500, $1,200 and $1,900. Annual per-
subscriber revenues generated by a single virtual channel under these
three assumptions are: $0.50 (low), $0.96 (base) and $1.27 (high).

Estimated annual operator revenues for advertiser-funded virtual
channels can range from $5,000 to more than $22,000 per channel. Using
rates from various cable advertising sources, estimated rate structures
could range from $500 to $1,900 a month per channel.

Scientific-Atlanta's model for subscription-based virtual information
channels (Table 4) assumes subscribers are charged a monthly fee for a
package of channels and that operators pass on 10% of these fees to
content providers.

The model considers three combinations of monthly pricing and
penetration: $1.00/30% (low), $2.00/42% (base) and $3.00/60% (high).
The annual per-subscriber revenues for these three scenarios are $3.24,
$9.07 and $19.44, respectively.

Based on S-A's analysis, a cable operator using advanced analog set-top
boxes to deliver an IVG and a package of subscription-based virtual
channels, might generate incremental annual revenues ranging from $4.86
to $55.73 per subscriber.

This does not include any additional PPV or subscription-service
revenues that might be generated by IVG and virtual channel promotional
material.

It also does not include potential revenues from direct-response
advertising in which subscribers use their remote control to request
follow-up mailings containing information about a product featured in a
tv ad. Experience with 800-number direct response ads suggests
advertisers are willing to pay significant amounts for access to such
self-selected prospects.

Estimated annual operator revenues for subscriber-based virtual
channels can range from $38,000 to more than $349,000 per package of
channels.

The S-A paper also offers the hybrid model - supported by subscribers
and sponsored by advertising. The subscriber pays an o-la-carte fee for
customized information; the advertiser charges lower advertising rates -
 possibly half the rate for completely advertiser-funded channels.
Benefits of this hybrid model include reduction of sponsorship costs
for the advertiser, allowing smaller advertisers to participate; the
ability for an advertiser to reach a specific target market, for
example, subscribers who pay for sports information; the provision to
subscribers of customized information at a reasonable price; and the
advantage for network operators to relay on two revenue streams
(advertiser and subscriber).

Virtual channels create a new market for content providers who develop
applications for virtual channels and software vendors who provide
authoring tools that facilitate building and testing applications.

So, given their potential revenues and modest incremental costs, it is
not surprising that advanced analog set-top decoders are gaining
increased attention from cable operators that face capital constraints
yet are eager to explore the brave new world of interactive tv.

MORE TV NEWS, OR MORE OF THE SAME?

ABC is launching a 24-hour news channel in the U.S. to capitalize on
its brand name, worldwide reporting resources and 200-plus broadcast
affiliates. NBC and Microsoft are launching a 24-hour news network for,
well, the same reasons, with the added boast they will take advantage
of emerging online distribution technologies.

Rupert Murdoch may launch a 24-hour news channel, he too for the
reasons cited by ABC and NBC, and  because CNN is too left-wing. "We
think it's time for a truly objective news channel," the mighty mogul
said during a speaking engagement.

While the ABC, Microsoft-NBC and Murdoch networks are six months to a
year or longer in the offing, just days ago CNN launched its third news
channel, CNN Financial News (CNNfn). And NBC is already on the air with
two info-oriented channels, CNBC and America's Talking. (NBC will, in
fact, drop America's Talking in favor of the new news network, MSNBC
Cable, thereby plugging it into 20 million homes the day it launches.)

If the rest of the mystic distribution puzzle can be solved, Americans
will be flooded with news. Unfortunately, they'll drown before they're
ever informed.

ABC executives talk about offering their network's top-rated programs -
shows like World News Tonight, Nightline and Good Morning America -
along with live coverage of major breaking news stories. In other
words, they'll chop up what they already produce, repackage it and then
add that greatest of all-news-network fillers, pictures of any old
event you can point a camera at.

It will be CNN with the one thing CNN doesn't have, big-name news shows
fronted by big-name news stars. NBC will do the same, though further
chopping up pictures and sound and graphics into finer bits and bytes
so all that content  can be downloaded from Microsoft's online service-
cum-web-site-cum-cyber-offering. Ditto Murdoch, though presumably his
will have to add in that special something that makes live shots of
press conferences, trials and Congressional hearings less left-wing.

These 24-hour wheels of news will spin and spin. Sparks will fly.
Images will leap from our televisions.

No doubt one of these networks will be on hand with a portable uplink
the day war breaks out somewhere. It will be the live shot of the
century.

No doubt all of them will switch on the next time a criminal-turned-
celebrity or celebrity-turned-criminal hears his verdict from the jury.
It will be a defining moment in our lives.

We and these networks will jump from live shot to defining moment to
live shot. Television news will finally give up any pretense that it
should, even every once in a while, explain what its cameras see or
examine what its microphones hear.

And let me be clear: explaining, examining, you don't do this by asking
your reporter on the scene for twenty seconds of what she thinks, or
even sitting five or six of them down in a studio to hash things over.
In the U.S., since the verdict in the O.J. Simpson trial, not one of
the networks has attempted anything like a definitive documentary on
the problem of race in this country - only the issue that looms largest
in America at the end of this, the American century. I'd expect such a
documentary to use all the story-telling technique and production
pizzazz I'm always told tv news can bring to bear on a story. Why was
the independent low-budget film Hoop Dreams a better examination of
race than anything any network attempted during or after the Simpson
trial?

When American troops are involved in skirmishing in Bosnia, no doubt
camera lenses will spring out of the brush faster than gun barrels. Has
any network even tried to explain how the former Yugoslavia got to be
the way it is, and, then, American soldiers got to be there? This is a
conflict where - at least until U.S. military involvement began -  the
U.S. public didn't care what was going on. So the network news
divisions didn't try too hard to explain it.

All of us, commentators and news executives alike, have for years
accepted the conventional wisdom that the U.S. networks had to give up
on serious documentary work. Prime-time just became too competitive to
waste it on old-time habits like examining and explaining. Today, when
the networks put current affairs in prime, the vehicle is the news
magazine, a salacious mix of consumer scare stories, celebrity (and
royalty) interviews and "investigative journalism" in which the good
guys and bad guys are clearly identified, and nothing much is learned
about a system or plan or idea.

But the broadcasting universe is changing. ABC and Microsoft-NBC, for a
start, are setting up new news networks, with all that round-the-clock
time to fill. Will we get what we gave up, or will it just be more - in
this case oceans more - of the same?
