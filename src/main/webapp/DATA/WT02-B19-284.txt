<CENTER><H3><B>IF IDEA REAUTHORIZATION IS TERMINATED<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 


The consequence of terminating the reauthorization process now in motion under S. 1578 and
H.R. 3268 would be:<br>

<ol><li>IDEA Parts C through H (the secretary-discretionary support programs and the Early
     Intervention Program) would be without authorizations, thus subject to complete
     termination.<P>
<li> New bills would need to be introduced in the House and Senate for the reauthorization
     of Parts C through H.<P>
<li> These new bills would need to travel through the decision-making process of
     subcommittee, full committee, full chamber in both the House and Senate, and then a
     House/Senate conference, all to be done without controversial attachments which might
     bog them down.<P>
<li> All of this would need to be done in the relatively few remaining "legislative days" of
     June, July and September (August is a recess period).<P>
<li> These reauthorizations could be for a time period of as many as five years, or for one
     year only.<P>
<li>If one year only, the entire reauthorization process of IDEA as we are experiencing it
     now could start from scratch again in the next Congress.  We would then be well into
     the fourth year of the current unfinished reauthorization process.<P>
<li> Whether the current reauthorization ceases or not, it is generally agreed that there will
     be an amendment to IDEA to deal with discipline, even if it is attached to some other
     legislation.</OL><P>
