<p>Wisconsin Public Service’s SolarWise for Schools® program selected the first three 
participants to receive 12-kW photovoltaic systems.  Two of the systems were installed 
this summer and the third will be installed in October. These participants are Antigo High 
School, Green Bay East High, and Southern Door Schools.    In addition to the photovoltaic 
systems, the schools will integrate renewable energy and environmental education into the 
curriculum with the help of Public Service.  In October, SolarWise for Schools® will begin 
to select the next program participants.  

<p>Northern States Power, under the EnergyWise® Solar Advantage program, is offering 
residential customers the opportunity to generate solar electricity for use in their 
homes.  NSP has already installed ten photovoltaic panels in homes in the Twin Cities and 
plans to install seven additional units.  The system allows the home-owners to utilize the 
power generated by the unit and sell any excess power to the utility at the customer’s 
regular rate.  NSP pays for and installs the systems with help from the U.S. Department of 
Energy and the Utility PhotoVoltaic Group.  Program participants pay an additional $50 on 
each month’s utility bill for five years and receive the power generated by the unit at no 
cost.  

<p>New York State Electric and Gas Company installed two residential photovoltaic systems in 
August under the UPVG TEAM-UP PV Friendly Pricing program.

<p>The City of Austin has developed its green-pricing program under the UPVG TEAM-UP PV 
Friendly Pricing program.  The program will be very similar to Detroit Edison’s 
SolarCurrents program.  Customers will have the opportunity to purchase 100 watt 
increments of power from photovoltaic systems that will be in three different types of 
applications: shade structures for parking lots, ballast-mounted arrays, and flat-topped 
commercial buildings.  The first installation is scheduled for October.

<p>Arizona Public Service Company plans to kick-off its PV Friendly Pricing program in 
October with PV installations beginning in December.

<p>Central and Southwest Services plans to install two residential PV systems under the UPVG 
TEAM-UP PV Friendly Pricing program.  Installation is targeted for the fall.

<p>Detroit Edison recently announced plans to build three additional photovoltaic systems in 
addition to the 28.4 kW system installed in April.  The plans call for three new facilities 
with a total output of 160 kW, including two 30 kW facilities serving residential 
customers and schools and a 100 kW facility serving and industrial customer.
