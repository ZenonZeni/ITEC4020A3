<P>
Why have mutual funds become so popular with
investors? The reason will become clearer as you examine the following reasons:

<P>
<STRONG><I>Diversification</I></STRONG>
<P>
Pooling shareholder dollars means that the
mutual fund can buy dozens and sometimes hundreds of different
securities. The average investor would find it difficult to amass
a portfolio as diversified as that of a mutual fund. The power
of diversification is that losses from certain securities can
sometimes be offset or even overshadowed by gains in others. This diversification 
helps reduce risks since the fund's success is not dependent on
how one or two holdings perform.

<P>
<STRONG><I>Professional Management</I></STRONG>
<P>
For those investors who have concluded that
all this investing stuff is not their &quot;cup of tea,&quot;
mutual funds provide low-cost access to professional money management.
Many individual investors recognize that they are better at their
own careers than they are as part-time money managers. 
<P>
The money accumulated in a mutual fund is managed
by professionals who decide where to invest it. Decisions are
based on the research of the fund's analysts and by the manager's
actual visits to the companies. As economic conditions change,
the fund may adjust its investments to adopt a more aggressive
or defensive position.

<P>
<STRONG><I>Liquidity</I></STRONG>
<P>
Mutual fund investors can sell all or any part
of their investment on any given business day based on the fund's
closing Net Asset Value (NAV) and the price a fund pays you per
share when you sell. NAV is the dollar value of one share of the
fund and is determined by dividing the current value of the fund
by the number of shares currently outstanding. Because the price
fluctuates daily, the current value may be more or less than the
original amount invested. Investors can find closing prices published
each day in the mutual fund section of most newspapers.

<P>
<STRONG><I>Low Initial Investment</I></STRONG>

<P>
Many mutual funds accept a minimum initial
investment of $1,000 and even smaller if the funds are in Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs).<I> </I>You<I> </I>may be able to invest
even less money initially if you establish an automatic investing
plan with a mutual fund company. These kinds of plans usually
require a $50 minimum investment with a monthly contribution of
at least $50. Subsequent investments may be automatically deducted
from a payroll or checking account. (See <A HREF="mudca.htm">Dollar-Cost Averaging</A>.)</I>

<P>
<STRONG><I>Potential For Monthly Income</I></STRONG>

<P>
Most people buy income funds because they pay monthly
dividends. This schedule gives investors a chance to
budget and pay their bills. Investors may also withdraw income
from  an equity fund by selling shares under a systematic withdrawal
plan. However, investors should be aware that any time the number
of shares is reduced, the value of the account will be reduced
if the market goes down.
