<h2>Victory in CDA Case!</h2>
<p>
On Wednesday June 12 at 9:00 am, a panel of three federal judges
in Philadelphia, PA granted the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition's (CIEC) request for a preliminary injunction
against the Communications Decency Act (CDA).   In a unanimous decision,
the judges ruled that the CDA would unconstitutionally restrict speech on
the Internet.
<P>
This is a major victory for Netizens!  The ruling soundly rejects
Congressional attempts to censor the Internet.  However, the government
will most certainly appeal this case to the Supreme Court, so the battle
against the CDA is not yet over.  All Internet users are encouraged to
join the fight against the CDA as the case moves to the Supreme Court.

In response to a complaint filed last week by the CIEC, a Federal Judge in
Philadelphia Wednesday ordered the Justice Department to stop all "reviews"
of complaints under the Communications Decency Act until the three-judge
panel rules on the constitutionality of the law.   The order was issued by
Judge Stewart Dalzell, one of the three judges presiding over the case.

<h3>Internet Users, Publishers, Online Service Providers, Non-Profit Groups, and Civil Liberties Advocates Fight The CDA in Court</h3>
<p>
<b>CDA is unconstitutional, Fails to Recognize Unique Nature of the Internet</b>
<P>
A coalition representing a broad spectrum of <a href = "#join">Internet users</a>, Libraries publishers, content providers and access providers filed a lawsuit on Monday February 26, 1996 in a Federal Court in Philadelphia, PA seeking to overturn the Communications Decency Act. The challenge argued that the Internet is a unique communications technology which deserves First Amendment protections at least as broad as those enjoyed as by the print medium.
<p>
The group, known as the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC -
pronounced "seek") is coordinated by <a href = "../index.html">the Center for Democracy and
Technology</a>, America Online, and the American Library Association, and
others, including People for the American Way. Its <a href = "#members"> 
35 members</a> include libraries, book publishers, newspaper publishers, editors, <a name = "join"> advertisers, commercial online</a> service providers, ISP's, non-profit groups, and civil liberties advocates.
<p>

<p>
<h3>Join the Fight To Protect Free Speech and the Future of the Internet!</h3>
<p>
CIEC is inviting individual Internet Users to join this landmark case to help  protect freedom of speech and the future of the Internet as a viable means of free expression, education, and commerce.
<p>
If you post messages to a public listserv, Usenet newsgroup, participate
in an IRC or chat session, or maintain your own World Wide Web page, ftp or
gopher archive, you could potentially face $250,000 fines or 2 years in jail if someone, somewhere considers the material you post to be "indecent" or "patently offensive"

<h3>The Complaint</h3>
<p>
On Monday, February 26, the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition, the 
American Library Association, America Online, Compuserve, Prodigy, Microsoft, NETCOM, The Commercial Internet eXchange, The Newspaper Association of America,  Wired Magazine, Hotwired, Families Against Internet Censorhip, and <a href = "#members">several other plaintiffs</a> filed suit in a Federal Court in Philadelphia, PA seeking to overturn the Communications Decency Act on the grounds that it is a violation of the First Amendment rights of all Internet users.
<p>
In a 73-page complaint that details the history of the Internet and
outlines how the network operates, the CIEC intended to educate the court
on how the Internet functions and why the broad content regulations imposed
by the CDA threaten the very existence of the Internet as a viable medium
for free expression, education, and commerce. Among other things, the CIEC challenge argued that:
<ul>
<li>The Internet is a unique communications medium which deserves First Amendment protections at least as broad as those afforded to print media.
<p>
<li>Individual users and Parents, not the Federal Government, should determine for themselves and their children what material comes into their homes based on their own tastes and values.
<p>
<li>The CDA will be ineffective at protecting children from "indecent" or "patently" offensive material online.
<p>
</ul>
The CIEC challenge is separate from the case brought by the ACLU, EFF,
EPIC, Planned Parenthood, and several other plaintiffs in the same
Philadelphia court on February 8, 1996.  The CIEC case
will reinforce the ACLU's efforts while focusing on the unique nature of
the Internet and alternatives to government content regulations.  On February 27, the ACLU and CIEC cases were officially consolidated.  Both the ACLU and CIEC attorneys are closely coordinating their efforts.
<p>
In order to demonstrate the nature of the Internet and the effectiveness of user empowerment technologies, CIEC arranged to wire the court room directly to the Internet.  The Center for Democracy and Technology, with the help of Bell Atlantic and Philadel

phia law firm <a href = "http://www.shsl.com">Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis</a> (an amicus counsel in the case), has installed a T-1 circuit and a small local area network in the Ceremonial Room of the Philadelphia court.  To the best of our knowledge

, this was the first time in history that a Federal Courtroom has been wired to the Net for the purposes of a Trial.
<p>
The outcome of the legal challenges to the CDA will likely determine the
legal status of speech on the Internet and the future of the First
