<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1839:</strong></font> Nineteen-year-old Edmund Becquerel, a French experimental physicist, discovered the
photovoltaic effect while experimenting with an electrolytic cell made up of two metal
electrodes.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1954:</strong></font> The PV effect in Cd was reported; primary work was performed by Rappaport, Loferski
and Jenny at RCA.  Bell Labs researchers Pearson, Chapin, and Fuller reported their discovery
of 4.5% efficient silicon solar cells; this was raised to 6% only a few months later (by a work
team including Mort Prince). Chapin, Fuller, Pearson (AT&T) submitted their results to the
Journal of Applied Physics. AT&T demonstrated solar cells in Murray Hill, New Jersey, then at
the National Academy of Science Meeting in Washington, DC.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1955:</strong></font> Western Electric began to sell commercial licenses for silicon PV technologies; early
successful products included PV-powered dollar bill changers and devices that decoded
computer punch cards and tape. Bell System's demonstration of the type P rural carrier system
began in Americus, Georgia. Hoffman Electronics's Semiconductor Division announced a
commercial PV product at 2% efficiency; priced at $25/cell and at 14 mW each, the cost of
energy was $1500/W.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1956:</strong></font> Bell System's demonstration of the type P rural carrier system was terminated after five
months.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1957:</strong></font> Hoffman Electronics achieved 8% efficient cells.  "Solar Energy Converting Apparatus,"
patent #2,780,765, was issued to Chapin, Fuller, and Pearson, AT&T.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1958:</strong></font> Hoffman Electronics achieved 9% efficient PV cells.  Vanguard I, the first PV-powered
satellite, was launched in cooperation with the U.S. Signal Corp. The satellite power system
operated for 8 years.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1959:</strong></font> Hoffman Electronics achieved 10% efficient, commercially available PV cells and
demonstrated the use of a grid contact to significantly reduce series resistance. Explorer-6 was
launched with a PV array of 9600 cells, each only 1 cm x 2 cm.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1960:</strong></font> Hoffman Electronics achieved 14% efficient PV cells.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1961:</strong></font> The UN conference on Solar Energy in the Developing World was held.  The precursor to
the PV Specialists Conference, the Meeting of the Solar Working Group (SWG) of the
Interservice Group for Flight Vehicle Power, was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The first
PV Specialists Conference was held in Washington, DC.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1963:</strong></font> Japan installed a 242-W PV array on a lighthouse, the world's largest array at that time.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1964:</strong></font> The Nimbus spacecraft was launched with a 470-W PV array.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1965:</strong></font> Peter Glaser, A.D. Little, conceived the idea of a satellite solar power station. Tyco Labs
developed the edge-defined, film-fed growth (EFG) process, first to grow crystal sapphire
ribbons and then silicon. 

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1966:</strong></font> The Orbiting Astronomical Observatory was launched with a 1-kW PV array.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1968:</strong></font> The OVI-13 satellite was launched with two CdS panels.

Mexico) using Solar Power Corp. modules. A 97.6-kW PV system was dedicated at Beverly
High School in Beverly, Massachusetts, using Solar Power Corp. modules. An 8-kW

production facility in Frederick, Maryland, with its roof-integrated 200-kW array. ARCO Solar's
Hisperia, California, 1-MW PV plant went on line with modules on 108 dual-axis trackers.

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1983:</strong></font> The JPL Block V procurement was begun. Solar Power Corporation completed the design
and installation of four stand-alone PV village power systems in Hammam Biadha, Tunesia (a
29-kW village power system, a 1.5-kW residential system, and two 1.5-kW irrigation/pumping
systems). Solar Design Associates completed the stand-alone, 4-kW (Mobil Solar), Hudson
River Valley home. Worldwide PV production exceeded 21.3 MW, and sales exceeded $250
million. 

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1984:</strong></font> The IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Award was presented to Drs. David Carlson and
Christopher Wronski at the 17th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, "for crucial contributions
to the use of amorphous silicon in low-cost, high-performance photovoltaic solar cells."

<p><font color="#F7DC00"><strong>1991:</strong></font> The Solar Energy Research Institute was redesignated as the U.S. Department of Energy's
