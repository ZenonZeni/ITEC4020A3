<p><i>Cincinnati, OH, April 29 , 1996 -- </i> The world renowned Ethicon Endo-Surgery (EES) Institute and other EES sponsored training 
centers across the nation have been enhanced by the presence of surgical robots from California-based Computer Motion, Inc.  AESOP 
(pronounced “eesop”) is a surgical robot capable of maneuvering and positioning a laparoscope (a video camera and light source which 
is passed through a specially designed tube and into the body allowing the surgeon to view the operation on a video monitor in the 
operating room).  This robot is under the direct control of the surgeon.<br>
</p>
<p>The introduction of AESOP at EES facilities marks a movement towards integrating robotics into mainstream surgical education curriculums.  
The use of AESOP at these centers will make it easier for surgeons to learn advanced videoscopic procedures by providing steady and controlled 
video images.  Attending surgeons will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with AESOP in a simulated operating room environment.<br>
<br>
<p>“Surgeons, nurses and hospital administrators are recognizing that robotic technology can deliver better outcomes at reduced costs,” said 
Gene Wang, CEO of Computer Motion.  “Our collaborative effort with Ethicon Endo-Surgery to successfully integrate AESOP into their learning 
centers demonstrates our commitment to educating the clinical community on the benefits that can be realized by using robotics in today’s 
healthcare environment.”<br>
</p>
<p>Cincinnati-based Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson (J & J) company, is the world’s leading producer of videoscopic surgical 
instruments.  The company has one of the most extensive videoscopic surgical education networks for healthcare professionals in the world.<br>
</p>
<p>“Ethicon is dedicated to the advancement of videoscopic surgery for patients, and to ensuring that surgeons, residents, nurses, and related 
professionals receive the education necessary to advance surgery into the 21st century,” said Frank Lyman, Vice President of Professional 
Education for Ethicon Endo-Surgery.  “Ethicon’s partnership with Computer Motion furthers our commitment to providing state-of-the-art surgical 
tools within our education system.”<br>
</p>
<p>AESOP (an acronym for Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning) was first introduced in October 1994.  Over 13,000 minimally 
invasive surgeries have been successfully assisted by AESOP in over 100 hospitals and surgery centers around the world.<br>
</p>
<p>“I’m extremely excited about the opportunity to present AESOP to my colleagues from all over the world and to the surgical residents here 
at the University,” said Dr. Jonathan M. Sackier, Director of the Endo-Surgical Educational and Research Center at George Washington 
University Medical Center, Washington, DC.  “The robot is critically important in advanced procedures such as Nissen Fundoplication for 
chronic heartburn where intracorporeal suturing is involved.  AESOP makes my job easier by providing a steady image and reducing crowding 
around the table.”<br>
</p>
<p>AESOP 1000, Computer Motion’s flagship product, is the first and only FDA cleared surgical robot.  The company recently previewed 
AESOP 2000 with Voice Control [pending 510(k) market clearance] at the SAGES 1996 and 5th World Congress Meeting.<br>
</p>
<p>“The future ability to control AESOP using simple voice commands will be truly remarkable,” said Dr. W. Peter Geis, Director of the 
Minimally Invasive Surgical Training Institute in Baltimore, MD.  “This is the first step toward enabling us to control all the peripheral 
equipment in the operating theater.”<br>
