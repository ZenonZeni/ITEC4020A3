LEGALIZATION MOVEMENT GETS BOOST

"It is our judgement that the war on drugs has failed," writes National
Review Editor William Buckley in the latest edition of the conservative
magazine. The issue includes articles favoring drug legalization by many
long-time legalization advocates, including: Ethan Nadelmann, director of
the Lindesmith Center; Steven B. Duke, a Yale University Law Professor;
Joseph D. McNamara, a former police chief; Kurt Schmoke, Mayor of
Baltimore; Thomas Szasz a Psychiatrist at Syracuse University, and Robert
W. Sweet, a federal judge in New York.

Buckley writes in the lead article that the war on drugs "is diverting
intelligent energy away from how to deal with the problem of addiction, that
it is wasting our resources, and that it is encouraging civil, judicial, and
penal procedures associated with police states." He said that the series of
articles in National Review was designed to mobilize "fresh thought on the
drug problem." However, prominent law enforcement and political leaders
from both major political parties sharply condemned the magazine.

DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine said that legalization would be a
disaster and that "As a citizen, I'm appalled at adding one more social 
ill to a country that already has AIDS and murders."

Former Drug Czar and Education Secretary William Bennett said that
"National Review's position on drug legalization is bankrupt morally,
intellectually and, thank god, politically."
In his National Review article Ethan Nadelmann said the "drug
enforcement/treatment complex" is so "hooked on government dollars that
the anti-drug crusade has become a vested interest." Nadelmann also had
harsh words for DEA's "ideologically driven bureaucrats who intimidate
and persecute doctors for prescribing pain medication in medically
appropriate doses, who hobble methadone programs with their
overregulation, who acknowledge that law enforcement cannot alone solve
the drug problem but then proceed to undermine innovative public health
initiatives."

Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke recommended that the war on drugs be
fought as a "public-health war." Under this system, he explains, the
government would set up a regulatory regime to "pull addicts into the
public-health system. The Government, not criminal traffickers, would
control the price, distribution, and purity of addictive substances-which it
already does with prescription drugs. This would take most of the profit out
of drug trafficking, and it is the profits which drive the crime," says
Schmoke.
He also recommended an expansion of needle exchange programs and
called the war on drugs "our domestic Vietnam."

Joseph McNamara, Former police chief (in Kansas City, Mo., and San Jose
Ca.) said the "military industrial complex pales in comparison to the host of
industries catering to our national puritanical hypocrisy-researchers willing
to tell the government what it wants to hear, prison builders, correction and
parole officers's associations, drug testing companies, dubious purveyors
of anti-drug education."

Robert Sweet, a District Judge in New York City argues that the rights of
the individual have been curtailed in the name of the War on Drugs. "We
have seen the elimination of an accused's right to pretrial release for most
charges under drug laws; heightened restrictions on post-conviction bail;
and invasions into the attorney-client relationship through criminal
forfeiture"

He also states that the "fundamental flaw, which will ultimately destroy this
prohibition as it did the last one, is that criminal sanctions cannot, and
should not attempt to, prohibit personal conduct, which does no harm to
others." He does not address the tragedy of drug addicted babies.

Thomas Szasz, of the Department of Psychiatry at Syracuse University,
charges that the war on drugs is a mass movement characterized by the
demonizing of drugs, addicts, and traffickers as the incarnations of evil. "It
is foolish to dwell on the drug prohibitionist's failure to attain his avowed
aims. Since he wages war on evil, his very effort is synonymous with
success. It is a fatal weakness of prudential critiques of drug policy 
that they ignore the Treligious' character of the war on drugs," says Szasz.

He asks that the right analogy for America's war on drugs is not the
Vietnam war, but communism. Szasz further suggests that "self-
medication" is a basic human right and drug criminalization is sinful.

Steven Duke, Law of Science and Technology Professor at Yale Law
School argues that under legalization, with drugs regulated by the
government, the "proportion of users who would consume drugs without
substantial health or other problems would be greatly increased. He writes
that the only benefit to America in maintaining prohibition is the "psychic
comfort we derive from having a permanent scapegoat. We would be better
off blaming our ills on celestial invaders flying about in flying saucers."

COPS PROGRAM FACES 25% CUT

The COPS police hiring program faces a 25% cut under a six week
continuing resolution enacted by Congress and signed by the President.
Bipartisan negotiations between the White House and Congress produced
another stopgap spending bill to keep the entire federal government running
through March 15. Also facing a 25% cut were the Ounce of Prevention
Council and the drug courts program.

Republicans abandoned their strategy to use government shutdowns as
leverage to advance their balanced-budget goals. Congress and the
administration produced a bill (HR 2880) that combined short-term funding
for nine Cabinet departments whose annual budgets have yet to become law
with full fiscal 1996 funding for foreign aid.

The Congressional budget ax would continue to nick but not behead some
cherished Clinton initiatives, including not only the COPS program, but
also the AmeriCorps National Service program, and subsidies for
community development financial institutions. Funding for these would
continue at a pro-rated level of 75 percent of last year's funding, at least
through March 15. The bill also would end 10 programs, mostly education
grants.

The measure also served as a vehicle for carrying a host of lower-profile
initiatives into law, including a ban on federal funding of fetal embryo
research, restrictions on excessive travel by Cabinet members and the sale
of $100 million worth of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Preserve.

The House passed the much-revised bill Jan. 25 on a 371-42 vote after a
full day of negotiations in the office of Appropriations Committee Chairman
Robert L. Livingston, R-La., finally produced a compromise that all sides
could live with.  The Senate cleared the bill the next day, 82-8, after
defeating Democratic amendments to raise the statutory debt limit and
restore spending on education to fiscal 1995 levels.

President Clinton signed it into law by the midnight Jan. 26 deadline. The
measure provided funding through March 15 at fiscal 1996 conference
levels for the departments of Commerce, Justice, State, Veterans Affairs,
and HUD and other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection
Agency. Clinton earlier had vetoed both the Commerce, Justice and State
bill and the VA-HUD measure.

Programs funded under the Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education bill (HR 2880) and the vetoed Interior spending measure (HR
2880) would be financed at fiscal 1995 levels or the House- or Senate-
passed levels, whichever is lowest. Meanwhile, House-Senate negotiators
on the District of Columbia spending bill (HR 2880) said that final action is
imminent on the measure after they reached agreement on a controversial
school voucher plan.

The final product reflected an unusual degree of bipartisanship, given the
rancor displayed during the two prior partial federal shutdowns. With the
House, Senate and the administration all seeking to avoid another
shutdown, the frequently intense negotiations required give on all sides.

Conspicuously absent was any effort to put more pressure on Clinton.  "We
want to get a signable bill," said Dan Meyer, the top aide to House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., as the talks were in the late stages.

TOUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKS

"Drug law enforcement has proven to be an effective and integral part of the
battle against illicit drugs and crime in United States," writes former
Michigan State Drug Czar Robert E. Peterson in a fact-filled new report
entitled, The Success of Tough Drug Enforcement.
Peterson uses scores of Justice Department studies to explain and describe
the positive impact of drug enforcement.

The report notes that from 1986-1992, a 13% rise in drug enforcement
manpower brought about a 39% increase in violent crime arrests and a
110% increase in heroin/cocaine trafficking arrests. Since 1980 drug
incarceration rates have increased over 400%. Peterson says that this
increased incarceration had let to the plummeting of murder rates and
narcotics related homicides in most American cities.

"Contrary to popular belief, most drug convicts, and nearly all drug
inmates, are repeat or violent offenders." Thus, getting them off the streets
sharply reduces crime.

Although some advocates for decriminalization of drugs state that U.S.
prisons are bursting with first time or minor offenders, Peterson finds
"Over 93% of state inmates are repeat and/or violent offenders and first time
non-violent marijuana inmates constitute only 1/10 of 1% of the prison
population. He also notes that the average amount of drugs in a marijuana
trafficking case is 3.5 tons, and for cocaine it is 180 pounds. Over 80% of
crack cases involve trafficking of an average quantity of over 18,000 crack
doses.

The report states that although the odds of imprisonment for drugs have
increased over the last ten years, the nation is still far too lenient with
drug felons.  A person, Peterson says, is more likely to go to a federal
prison for violating federal tax, regulatory, immigration, or liquor laws than
for possessing heroin, crack or marijuana.

Nonetheless, those drug criminals that are placed behind bars, result in a
significant cost savings to the public. This is due to the fact that most drug
felons are repeat offenders, many involved with drugs. One study found
that heroin users committed more that 200 crimes per year to support their
drug habit.

The cost of incarcerating criminals averages $20,000 to $27,000 per year.
The estimated cost to society for crimes committed by the average released
criminal, range from $172,000 to $2.36 million per year. Under these
figures, based on several recent federal, state, and think tank studies, it
costs society at least seven times less money to keep someone in prison than
to let them go free.

Peterson strongly supports drug treatment, both for those who are in prison
and for those who are not.  However, he warns that without a regular regimen
of drug testing, treatment failure rates increase.  "Self-reports, counselor
reports, and infrequent or random drug testing significantly under-reports
individual drug use," says Peterson.  He cites a program in Lansing Michigan
which has kept 75% of participants drug-free over a five year period.  As part
of this program drug offenders are drug tested three times per week.  If
tested positive participants face a first sanction of three days in jail, a
second sanction of ten days in jail, a third sanction of 20 days jail and 30
days for each positive drug test thereafter.  Only a small proportion of
program participants ever served jail time.  Although counseling and support
groups (such as AA or NA) were provided, success rates did not vary among
those who participated in these activities.

Another area touched on in the report was the remarkable cost effectiveness
of the Drug Enforcement Administration-through bringing in asset
forfeiture funds. From 1990 to 1993 DEA's budget was $2.7 billion while
$2.2 billion in drug assets were forfeited to the United States. In 1990 an
average of over $250,000 was forfeited by drug dealers for each DEA
Special Agent.

An entire chapter of The Success of Tough Drug Enforcement is dedicated to
analysis of drug enforcement and race.  Peterson find that racial disparities
for drug offenses were lower than that for other crimes, such as murder,
robbery, and violent crime.  Generally, he explains, arrest and incarceration
rates are correlated with victimization rates, crime rates, and complaint
rates.  For example, the robbery rate among blacks is over three times that of
whites and the robbery convictions for blacks is two times that of whites in
state courts.  The rape conviction rate was nearly two times higher for whites
than blacks, and rape victims also were nearly twice as likely to be white.

Overall, blacks were victims of  violence at a rate of 40% higher than that of
whites and arrests of blacks were 39% higher than they were for whites.
Time served by drug offenders also does not vary significantly by race. For
drug trafficking offenses, blacks serve an average of 6% less time in prison
than whites.

Peterson makes a series of drug control policy recommendations in the
report. He suggests that drug enforcement efforts target youth with
sentences that include "strict zero tolerance drug testing" with  treatment
imposed by courts and probation departments. More serious repeat and
violent youth offenders "must be incapacitated and kept from victimizing
communities," he said.

The report also recommends a radical overhaul of probation and parole.
"The current failure rate of those on community release and lack of
consequences for violators indicate that this a weak link in the criminal
justice systems," Peterson says." The earlier that tough, but fair,
community release sanctions and conditions are applied, the greater the
likelihood of deterring crime and drug use, he argues.

Finally, Peterson recommends tougher marijuana enforcement, which has
become, he argues, "far too lax" while use of the drug by youth has rapidly
escalated. The proportion of violent juveniles on marijuana when arrested
has climbed and high school use of the drug has doubled in the last several
years. Peterson recommends that public benefits, student aid, and other
privileges be suspended, reduced, or conditioned on cessation of drug use
and criminal activity. Hefty finds and license revocations can be invoked
and public service conditions applied to repeat marijuana offenders.

The report's author, Robert Peterson served as Governor John Engler's
Drug Control Director from 1991-1995 where he Administered and
evaluated education, health, and law enforcement grant programs. Before
that he served as a prosecutor in Buffalo and a policy adviser to
Pennsylvania's Attorney General. He currently runs his own consulting
firm, PAE Services, Inc., which specializes in evaluating drug control
programs. Peterson can be reached at (607) 786-1845. Individual copies of
the report are available at $20 each from PAE.

NEW DRUG CZAR NAMED

U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey, named the new Director of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy during President Clinton's January 24
State of the Union Address, is expected to promote closer cooperation
between drug trafficking and producing countries to fight the narcotics trade
in his new job as President Clinton's drug czar.

Clinton said during his nationally televised speech, "General McCaffrey has
earned three purple hearts and two silver stars fighting for this country.
Tonight I ask that he lead our nation's battle against drugs at home and
abroad. To succeed, he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded
before. He needs all of us - every one of us has a role to play on this team.
Thank you, General McCaffrey, for agreeing to serve your country one
more time."

 The general's stint as commander-in-chief of the United States Southern
Command in Panama included collaboration among Latin American
countries, especially Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, in the war on drugs.

"McCaffrey has praised the Andean range countries, where most of the
cultivation of cocaine takes place, of working together. He has always said
when countries work together, they benefit economically and socially," a
military spokesman said.

McCaffrey is a veteran of the Vietnam and Gulf Wars known for his tough
yet conciliatory style, McCaffrey, 53, was assigned in February 1994 as
commander-in-chief of Southcom, which is responsible for all U.S. military
activities in Latin America south of Mexico.

Some Army officials wondered though whether he did the right thing in
accepting the anti-drug post because as the highest decorated officer, he was
in line to become the next Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Some Panamanian officials hope he will make a case to keep some U.S.
troops in Panama after the canal treaties expire in the year 2000, especially
Howard Air Force Base which serves as the South American headquarters
of the  U.S. military's anti-drug trafficking efforts.

American AWACs reconnaissance aircraft fly regular missions from the
base to seek out drug planes flying up from South America towards Central
America and Mexico.

"They've given us information about flight plans of drug traffickers and
helped us detect shipments," said Panama's anti-drug chief Gabriel Castro.

Previously, General McCaffrey served as Director for Strategic Plans and
Policy, Joint Staff, from 1993 to 1994, and as Assistant to the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1992 to 1993.  From 1990 to 1992, General
McCaffrey commanded the 24th Infantry Division, which he deployed to
Saudi Arabia in 1990.  He led the Division on combat operations during
Operation Desert Storm, for which he was awarded the Distinguished
Service Medal.

From 1989 to 1990, General McCaffrey served as Director for Strategy,
Plans, Policy and Joint Affairs for the Department of the Army.  He served
as the Deputy U.S. Military Representative to the NATO Military
Committee from 1988 to 1989.  He has also taught American Government,
National Security Studies and Comparative Politics at the United States
Military Academy at West Point.

General McCaffrey has been decorated for valor twice with the
Distinguished Service Cross - our nation's second highest award for valor
in combat - twice with the Silver Star, three times with the Bronze Star, and
was three times awarded with the Purple Heart for wounds received in
combat.  He is the most highly decorated Army General on active duty.
General McCaffrey received the NAACP Roy Wilkins Renown Service
Award in 1991, and the U.S. Department of State's Superior Honor Award
in 1992. He is a 1964 graduate of the United States Military Academy at
West Point, and earned a Master of Arts degree in civil government from
American University.

The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was established in
1988 and is organized within the Executive Office of the President.
ONDCP's mission is to develop and coordinate the policies, goals and
objectives of the nation's drug control program for reducing the use of illicit
drugs.  The ONDCP Director is the Administration's primary spokesperson
for drug issues, and develops and coordinates the National Drug Control
Strategy.

VIOLENT CRIME COMMISSION ISSUES REPORTS

The first report of a bipartisan commission on violent crime finds that
despite a welcome decline in crime rates in many U.S. cities, the chances
that Americans will be victims of violent crime remains at an historic high.
The report also deplored the "revolving door" American criminal justice
system in which one of three criminals are supposedly under the
supervision of the justice system at the very time that they murder, rape and
commit other serious crime.

The report, entitled The State of Violent Crime in America, was issued by
the Council on Crime in America, which is co-chaired by former U.S.
Attorney General Griffin B. Bell and Former Drug Czar William J. Bennett.

According to the report, the risk of becoming a victim of violent crime today
exceeds many significant life risks, including injury in a motor vehicle
accident and death from heart disease. Much violent crime, moreover, goes
unreported. The actual number of violent crimes in 1993 (10.9 million) was
5.6 times higher than the number of violent crimes reported to the police
(1.9 million).

"This study paints a realistic and sobering picture of violent crime in
America, but it is not without its ray of hope," said Bennett. "If the success
that cities such as New York and Houston have had in reducing crime rates
teaches us anything, it is that the common sense of the American people is
right when it comes to crime: tough law enforcement is part of the solution,
not part of the problem."

The report attempts to refute some myths about incarceration rates in the
U.S. It found, for example, that the American prison system imprisons just
one criminal for every 100 violent crimes.

John Walters, who served in the Drug Czar's office during the Bush
Administration, is the Council's Executive Director. Other Council members
are former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, Florida Attorney General
Robert Butter-worth, Princeton University Professor John DiIulio,
California Board of Prison Terms Commissioner John Gillis, Indianapolis
Mayor Stephen Goldsmith and Colorado Attorney General Gale Northon.

HOW TO KILL MANUAL CRITICIZED

The instructions are precise and clinical, with gruesome detail to clearly
explain the best way to kill.

"At least three shots should be fired to insure quick and sure death. Aim for
the head-preferably the eye sockets if you are a sharp shooter."
That's just what James Edward Perry did when he walked into a suburban
Maryland home outside Washington in 1993 and pulled the trigger of his
rifle, killing two women before suffocating a severely disabled child in an
alleged  murder-for-hire scheme.
His method, his weapon, his attempted coverup-all allegedly were straight
out of the book, Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors.

Perry was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders. But, according
to a novel lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court in Maryland, the
book's publishers also
should have to pay.

"This book makes no bones about it. It is simply an instruction manual like
the one you operate your VCR with, but this one tells you how to kill
people," said John Marshall of Rockville, Md., one of the lawyers who
filed the suit.

The lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount of money from Paladin
Enterprises Inc. and its founder, Peder C. Lund, is believed to be the first
of its kind against a book publisher.

Courts have held magazines like Soldier of Fortune liable for running
advertisements offering hit-man services. But they've yet to hold publishers
responsible for the conduct of someone who learned how to commit crimes
from a book.

Already it's got some legal experts talking about dangerous precedents,
because the case, they say, raises troubling 1st Amendment issues. When
can a court punish publication of truthful information, even information that
has no redeeming value? And if you allow a lawsuit against the book
publisher in this case, what's to stop lawsuits against, for example, makers
of violent movies whose crimes are duplicated in real life?
That's not to say those distinctions can't be drawn, legal experts say, but,
as with most 1st Amendment issues, it would be tricky.

"It would require a change in 1st Amendment analysis to hold publishers
responsible for the crime that ultimately would occur," said Douglas Kmiec,
a  professor at Notre Dame University Law School in South Bend, Ind.

Perry was convicted last year of killing Mildred Horn, her quadriplegic son
and nurse Janice Saunders. He allegedly committed the crimes at the
direction of Horn's ex-husband, Lawrence Horn, who is accused of
ordering the murders to get a $1 million award his son received in a medical
malpractice lawsuit. Horn will stand trial in April.

In Perry's trial, prosecutors cited more than two dozen instances in which
he followed the book to the letter in carrying out the alleged murder-for-hire
scheme. He used the same kind of rifle, rubbed out its serial numbers and
shot the women three times each in the eyes. He also used a homemade
silencer and filed down parts of the rifle, just as the book said.

Furthermore, he allegedly followed the book's suggestions to request
money up front, make the crime scene look like a burglary and discard the
gun. But Dan Hale, a lawyer for the book's publisher, said those things
shouldn't make the Boulder, Colo.-based company liable for Perry's
actions.

"The people who are responsible are the people who committed the crime,"
Hale said. To hold otherwise, he said, would mean scaling back the 1st
Amendment.

The 1st Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and press, does
not protect all speech. The Supreme Court has carved out certain
exceptions, ruling, for example, that speech that is obscene or libelous or
creates a  clear and present danger of imminent lawless action is not always
entitled to  1st Amendment protection. As a result, the government can
restrict it or, in some cases, punish people for engaging in it.

The victims' families in this case argue that the information in "Hit Man"
should be considered unprotected speech, just like libel or defamation. "Our
argument is that there is currently no protection for speech that aids and
abets an illegal transaction," said Rod Smolla, a professor at the College of
William and Mary Law School in Williamsburg, Va., who is also
representing the families. "Because it has absolutely no value of any kind,
it is not protected under the 1st Amendment."

But finding a judge sympathetic to that argument will be difficult, Kmiec
said. Though a libel lawsuit limits speech, it is justified under the 1st
Amendment because the material is false. Here, the material is true-and its
truth only makes it more awful, Kmiec said. "The plaintiff will have to
prove not that the material is false but that it is worthless," Kmiec said.
"There's no directly applicable precedent."

But, as Kmiec noted, deciding what's worthless would be as difficult as
determining what's obscene. Courts have long struggled with trying to
figure  that one out. Hale argued that "culpability lies with Mr. Perry. And if
he conspired with Mr. Horn, he'll  probably be convicted, as well."

The courts will have to decide-meanwhile, the murder manual is still for
sale.

VIRGINIA REFORMS CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

Hundreds of violent juvenile offenders would be tried automatically as
adults and face stiffer prison time under a compromise struck last month
between Gov. George Allen and state General Assembly leaders. The
compromise proposal could clear the way for overhauling Virginia's
juvenile justice system, which many say is ill-equipped to handle the
increasingly violent crimes committed by children as young as 14.

Juvenile offenders currently can serve no more than seven years in prison
and must be released when they turn 21, no matter how dangerous they are
deemed to be. Allen, who made juvenile justice reform a top priority of his
legislative agenda this year, was quick to trumpet the bipartisan compromise
at a hastily arranged news conference held just hours after striking the deal.
"This will send a message to young people that we're not just going to give
you a slap on the wrist," Allen said.

The agreement, which resolves differences between two competing plans,
calls for automatically trying as adults all juveniles 14 and older accused of
violent crimes such as murder, rape and forcible sodomy. As part of the
new compromise, juveniles charged with some less-severe  violent
crimes - robbery, carjacking, kidnapping - would be tried as adults  at the
discretion of the local prosecutor.  In addition, judges would be given new
sentencing options beyond  incarceration and probation.

Allen's budget includes $8.5 million for new boot camps and "wilderness
work camps" that are aimed at giving young offenders a second chance
through rehabilitation. Even a juvenile offender sentenced as an adult could
get his or her sentence suspended if a Circuit Court judge chooses to make
use of such alternative programs. "The compromise we offer today reflects
a concern and commitment to be responsive to the vast majority of the
young people who come before the court on minor charges and are in need
of remediation to turn their lives around," said Del. Jerrauld C. Jones, D-
Norfolk, who chaired a legislative task force and helped broker the new
compromise.

The plan also opens long-secretive juvenile court proceedings to the public
when juveniles are charged with felony crimes. Juvenile criminal history
records would also be made public when youths are convicted of felonies.
Attorney General James S. Gilmore III, who headed Allen's advisory
commission, said the compromise struck a careful balance between tougher
sentencing and increased prevention and rehabilitation programs. "We will
prevent, rescue and redirect where and when we can," Gilmore said. "But
we will also punish where we have to, with the paramount concern being
the protection of the community."

The compromise, reached in the opening weeks of the 60-day session, also
reflects the conciliatory tone Allen has taken with the legislature this year,
after watching Democrats kill most of his initiatives in last year's more
polarized session. "Obviously, you can't do things with just Republicans
alone," Allen said. "I think this is a good sign for this session of the
General Assembly."

The actual, practical effect of the plan, if approved, may be difficult to
measure and could vary by locality.  Prosecutors say many of the most
violent juveniles, such as those who commit murder, are already tried as
adults. Judges increasingly transfer teen-agers into adult courts in response
to soaring juvenile crime rates,  they say.

But administration officials say the proposed automatic transfer would target
hundreds more violent teen-agers who now escape any serious punishment
in the juvenile system.  A state study found that of 1,400 juveniles aged 14
and older charged with violent crimes in 1993, fewer than 20 percent were
tried as adults.

Under the juvenile system, the average prison time served for murder was
less than six years. Juveniles who commit rape serve less than five years on
average. And those who commit armed robbery serve about a year,
administration figures show. "I think that sends the wrong message," Allen
said. "Most people say this is just ridiculous."  But critics, who packed a
committee hearing Wednesday, said the plan offers nothing but a simplistic
"harsher-is-better" philosophy.

"That may be the stuff of good politics," said Judith Bennett, of the
Virginia Council of Churches. "It is not the stuff of which sound public
policy is made."  There is little evidence in other states to suggest that
sentencing children as adults will reduce crime, said Julie McConnell,
associate director of the American  Civil Liberties Union's Virginia chapter.

"It is an abdication of our obligation as adults to protect and guide  children
into responsible and socially productive lives," McConnell said.

But few dispute the need to crack down on violent juvenile crime, which
has increased by 36 percent since 1975, according to a study by the Joint
Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the General Assembly's
investigative  arm. To fund the plan, Allen has included $16.7 million in a
bond package that would pay for a renovation and expansion of the
Southampton Correctional  Center, which would house violent juveniles
who are sentenced as adults.

Overall, Allen's budget includes nearly $200 million to meet the rising costs
of a burgeoning juvenile justice system, although more than half that figure
comes from bonds to build new juvenile prisons.  Those bonds include
about $41.6 million in debt already authorized by the legislature to renovate
the Beaumont Correctional Center west of Richmond and build a new 180-
bed center in Chesterfield County.

JUDGE SAYS ITS OK TO RUN FROM POLICE

A federal judge who came under fire for tossing out evidence in a
Washington Heights drug case said  that there was little chance he would
reverse his ruling, and he called prosecutors' bid to get him to change his
mind a "juvenile project."

In a three-way conference call with lawyers from his chambers, Judge
Harold Baer, Jr. said he would listen to prosecutors' arguments that drug
evidence and a videotaped confession should not be thrown out in a federal
case against Carol Bayless, 41.

More than once, however, the judge made it clear that he probably would
not change his decision that the police did not have a reasonable suspicion to
pull over Ms. Bayless's car in the Washington Heights section of
Manhattan.

"While I consider it a rather juvenile project to engage in at this juncture,"
Baer said of prosecutors' bid to get him to reconsider his Jan. 24 ruling, "I
don't have a problem in letting them re-argue."

Baer went on to say: "I doubt that the government has anything new and
different that they can show me in the papers or on the law. But so far as I
am concerned, they certainly should have that opportunity."

In a ruling last week that has been criticized by many of the city's and the
state's top officials, Baer refused to allow as evidence 75 pounds of cocaine
and more than 4 pounds of heroin that the police said they had seized from
Ms. Bayless's rented car on Amsterdam Avenue at 5 a.m. on April 21. The
drugs were estimated to have a street value of $4 million.

The judge ruled that the drugs and Ms. Bayless's videotaped confession
were not admissible as evidence because officers stopped her car without
reasonable suspicion.

An officer who saw Ms. Bayless said he suspected criminal activity in part
because four men who had loaded two duffel bags into her trunk ran away
after seeing him.

But Baer, who served on the Mollen Commission, which investigated
police corruption, said that it was not necessarily suspicious behavior for
people to flee the police in Washington Heights, a neighborhood where, he
said, residents regarded police officers as "corrupt, abusive, and violent."

"Had the men not run when the cops began to stare at  them, it would have
been unusual," Baer wrote.

The ruling immediately touched off a firestorm of criticism from politicians
and law enforcement officials, and quickly became fodder for newspaper
editorials and radio talk shows. Critics accused Baer of being more
concerned about protecting criminals than protecting the public, and said
that his comments about the police unfairly maligned hard-working, honest
officers. Police Commissioner William J. Bratton went so far as to say the
judge was "living in a fantasy land."

Baer, a 1994 Clinton administration appointee to the federal bench, has
repeatedly declined to speak to the public or the press about his ruling and
its potential impact on law enforcement efforts. During the 10-minute
hearing no one mentioned the publicity or criticism that the ruling has
attracted for more than a week.

But the judge's remarks are the first indication of how he would view
prosecutors' efforts to persuade him to change his mind. His remarks were
included in a 10-page transcript of the hearing released late on Friday.

A spokesman for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the judge's latest remarks
were relayed  to the mayor, who had harshly criticized the judge's original
decision.

"The mayor is hopeful that Judge Baer's decision will be reversed so a
confessed drug dealer will not go free," the spokesman, Colleen Roche,
said on Friday night. Ms. Roche added that the mayor would not
specifically comment on what the judge said.

A spokesman for Gov. George Pataki said the governor would have no
comment beyond his earlier criticism of the ruling.

In a conference call prosecutors asked the judge for more time to prepare
papers on the issue. But Jay Holtmeier, assistant U.S. attorney, said
prosecutors plan to ask Bear to reopen the hearing on the motion to
suppress evidence.
"Reopening the hearing had never been an item that I had focused on at all,"
Baer told him. "So I am not clear how I come out."

Ramon W. Pagan, Ms. Bayless's lawyer, argued that the prosecutors
should not be permitted to ask Baer to reconsider his decision.

"I think they are trying to create something which is very new and unusual,"
Pagan said. "If they lose a case, they want to redo it again and do an instant
replay, without the direction of the Court of Appeals, and that is not the
way." Baer said prosecutors still had seveal more days to file their motion
for reconsideration.

CRIME DISCUSSED AT STATE OF UNION ADDRESS

President Clinton, preparing to embark on his re-election campaign,
dedicated a significant chunk of his State of the Union Address to crime
issues.

He said during the speech, "At last we have begun to find the way to reduce
crime, forming community partnerships with local police forces to catch
criminals and to prevent crime. This strategy, called community policing is
clearly working," Clinton said.

He cited declining Violent crime rates. In New York City, murders are
down 25%, in St. Louis 18%, in Seattle 32%.  But, he said,  we still have a
long way to go before our streets are safe and our and our people are free of
fear.  He told the audience of Members of Congress that the Crime Bill of
1994 "is critical to the success of community policing. It provides funds for
100,000 new police in communities of all sizes. We are already a third of
the way there and I challenge Congress to finish the job.  Let us stick with
the strategy that's working, and keep the crime rate coming down."

Clinton also asked all Americans to respect and support our law
enforcement officers, and told police, "our children need you as role models
and heroes. Don't let them down."

In spite of its unpopularity with the current Congress, Clinton reported that
the Brady Bill has already stopped 44,000 people with criminal records
from buying guns. He also said that the assault weapons ban is keeping 19
kinds of assault weapons out of the hands of violent gangs. "I challenge the
Congress to keep those laws on the books," he said.

The President also announced several new initiatives. "Our next step in the
fight against crime is to take on gangs the way we once took on the Mob. I
am directing the FBI and other investigative agencies to target gangs that
involve juveniles in violent crime and to seek authority to prosecute - as
adults - teenagers who maim and kill like adults," the
President said.

He also offered hope to public housing residents who have been frustrated
with the long legal process usually required for drug-related evictions.
"From now on, the rule for residents who commit crime and peddle drugs
should be: One strike and you're out," the President said.

Clinton challenged every state to match federal policy, to assure that
serious, violent criminals serve at least 85% of their sentence.

However, the President also emphasized the importance of drug and crime
prevention programs. He said more police and punishment are important,
but they're not enough. "We have got to keep more of our young people out
of trouble, with prevention strategies not dictated by Washington, but
developed in communities.  I challenge all of our communities, all of our
adults, to give these children futures to say yes to. And I challenge
Congress not to abandon the Crime Bill's support of these grass-roots
prevention efforts."

Clinton added that to reduce crime and violence, we have to reduce the drug
problem. "The challenge begins in our homes, with parents talking to their
children openly and firmly, and embraces our churches and synagogues,
our youth groups and our schools. I challenge Congress not to cut our
support for drug-free schools. People like D.A.R.E. officers are making a
real impression on grade school children that will give them the strength to
say no when the time comes," he said.

The day after the speech Clinton traveled to Louisville, Kentucky to test his
anti-crime themes on the road. Clinton does not plan to officially announce
his re-election bid until spring. But the State of the Union speech to
Congress and the next day's trip to a state that will be an election-year
battleground effectively launched his campaign.
In a roundtable discussion with police and community leaders, he argued
that Republican efforts to transform the current COPS program into a block
grant program for states should be defeated.

The split over community policing underscores the philosophical divide
between Clinton and the Republican-led Congress over spending and tax
priorities that's led to the budget stalemate.

But Wednesday House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Republicans are ready
to take Clinton up on his budget compromise offer. He suggested that the
White House and Congress agree to a budget "downpayment" of around
$100 billion.

RAP GROUPS TO RAISE MONEY FOR SLAIN OFFICER:

On Sunday, February 18, members of Philadelphia's hip hop community
and Philadelphia police officers will host a benefit for slain police officer
Lauretha Vaird's family. Organized by members of the rap group Da Fat Cat
Clique, the benefit is being held to raise money for the slain officer's family
and to forge a relationship between hip hoppers and cops.  "Too often
people think that rappers are just about violence and crime.  Well, many of
us have jobs and we don't condone nor endorse cop killing.  We think that
this benefit will give us a chance to let the public know that we respect
police officers and that all of us are not negative," said Criz, of Da Fat Cat
Clique.  Several important Philadelphians have been invited to attend the
benefit including Mayor Ed Rendell and Police Commissioner Richard
Neal. There will be performances by rap artists such as Jackal the Bear, Da
Youngstas (Illy Funkstas), The Man They Call Lux, Ital Tha Ruffian and

HUGE FORENSIC SCIENCE CENTER TO OPEN IN FLORIDA:

A new forensic science center is expected to bring thousands of crime lab
workers to St. Petersburg, Florida for training. The National Forensic
Science Technology Center has officially opened for business at St.
Petersburg Junior College's Allstate Center.  It is likely to attract more than
1,000 visitors this year and far more in future years, said Dr. Joan Wood,
Pinellas-Pasco medical examiner and  president of the new center's board of
directors. She said job opportunities  in forensics have been expanding, but
training programs have failed to keep  pace with the demand. "I think we
have a tremendous future ahead of us," she said. This week more than 100
people, most of them from out of state, attended the center's inaugural
three-day workshop, which featured Bruce Weir, a DNA expert who
testified in the O.J. Simpson trial.  Eventually the center could be offering a
workshop every other week, Wood said. It also will be involved in joint
educational programs with the junior college, the University of South
Florida and the University of Central Florida. Other activities will include
research, creation of teaching videos and  computer discs, and development
of industry standards. The center will have a  director and a small support
staff, Wood said.

ATLANTA TARGETS VIOLENT CRIME FOR OLYMPICS:

Atlanta, ranked the most violent U.S. city for the second straight year in a
new survey, is battling to cleanse its image ahead of playing host to the
world for the Olympic Games.  City officials said a private survey that
named Atlanta as the most dangerous U.S. city in violent crime such as
murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, was using outdated statistics
that don't reflect improvements in 1995.  The Morgan Quitno survey, based
on 1994 FBI crime statistics, found Atlanta for the second year in a row to
be the least safe of the 100 largest U.S. cities, or those with more than
100,000 people. The Atlanta Olympics, from July 19 to August 4 this year,
will be the biggest ever, bringing together more than 10,000 athletes from
197 countries. Atlanta officials boast that it will be the most compact Games
in history, with most events and the Olympic Village concentrated in a small
downtown area. But that area is in a high-crime part of the city center where
local residents fear to tread at night. Panhandlers and the homeless are a
frequent sight in the area dubbed "the Olympic Ring." Local journalist Dave
Kindred commented that the Olympic Ring was already crowned with
barbed wire, even at Coca-Cola's world headquarters.

COMMUNITY POLICING BRINGS HOPE TO BAKERSFIELD:

Tony Martinez, a community services specialist with the Bakersfield Police
Department, who has been coordinating city support for projects that
increase neighborhood pride and decrease neighborhood crime. Since April,
Martinez has roamed the neighborhood west of Lakeview Avenue in a van
that touts his Community Oriented and Problem Solving program (COPS).
He has helped set up Neighborhood Watch, clean up vacant lots and
houses, install and replace street lights, remove abandoned vehicles and
increase street police patrols. In addition, the city closed off Gorrill and
Ralston streets at Lakeview  Avenue three years ago to reduce pedestrian
accidents and street-corner drug  dealing. One effect has been that since
June, the neighborhood around Gorrill Street has had only four burglaries,
Martinez said. That's remarkable because it would not have been unusual
for the neighborhood to have four burglaries a  week, he said. "It is the
people in the neighborhood who are taking care of each other," Martinez
said.  Citizens credit Martinez with helping to make changes in the
neighborhood. "Now there is someone to talk to, to listen to our problems
and explain what can be done" one resident said.

company giant Adidas to recall or stop selling its "The Hemp" shoe. The
shoe had ben scheduled for distribution to its vast network of retailers over
the next few months. "Hemp" is a street slang for marijuana. In a statement
amplifying a letter to Adidas America President Steve Wynne, Brown said.
"The people at this shoe company apparently think this is cute, but it is
really quite deadly--especially at a time in which more and more of our
young people do not fear illegal drugs and as a result are using them.
Moreover, it has been widely reported that the shoe" had previously been
called the Chronic--another street name for marijuana. Wynne's response to
Brown stated that "Hemp is not marijuana." But Brown, in a second letter
replied, "You fail to get the point. It doesn't matter what the your shoe is
made of -- the question is what you call it." Brown also charged that Adidas
shows a blatant disregard of the fact that we now have a crisis among kids
who think using marijuana is the thing to do. To receive more information
on this topic, contact the Drug Czar's office at (202) 395-6618.

FEDERAL JUDGE HALTED SALE OF DRUG DETECTION DEVICE:

A federal judge last month temporarily halted manufacture and sale of a
device sold to schools, prisons, airports and law enforcement as a drug and
explosives detector. Government tests indicated it's a fake. FBI agent
Norman Townsend told a federal judge that 1,000 Quadro Trackers, also
known as Quadro Positive Molecular Locators, have been sold or ordered
for $395 to $8,000 apiece. But he said analysis by FBI Laboratory
technicians and by the Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratories
show the device is nothing more than a hollow plastic box attached to a
retractable transistor radio antenna. A "chip" inside was found to be two
pieces of plastic surrounding "a small piece of polymer coated white paper,
similar to a candy bar wrapper," Townsend wrote in an affidavit. At the
request of the Justice Department, which is conducting a fraud
investigation, U.S. District Judge Thad Heartfield in Beaumont, Texas,
signed the restraining order against Quadro Corp. of Harleyville, S.C., its
Texas subsidiary and four company officers. The judge found "probable
cause to believe that defendants are engaged in mail and wire fraud." A
schools use package was priced at $995 and law enforcement packages
ranged from $1,145 to $5,000. Locator cards to be inserted in the device
were priced at $250 for heroin and $25 for golf balls, Townsend said.

POLICING DRUG HOT SPOTS IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE:

In a two page Research Preview National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Director,
Jeremy Travis, describes and summarizes the results of recent research on
police efforts to target drug hot spots. In 1990 the  NIJ initiated the Drug
Market Analysis Program (DMA) in order to develop strategies for
addressing street level drug problems and encourage innovations in
geographic analysis of crime. In Jersey City, New Jersey, one of five DMA
demonstration sides, an evaluation was conducted in 1993 of an innovative
drug enforcement strategy that focused on hot spots of drug activity. This
study found consistent and strong effects of the experimental policing
strategy on disorder related emergency calls for service. The data suggested
that surrounding areas of the hot spots also benefited. To receive a copy of
this Research Preview, entitled "Policing Drug Hot Spots" contact NIJ at

DUF DATA FOR 1994 SHOWS COCAINE USE STILL HIGH:

Recently released findings from the Drug Use Forecasting (DUF) program
for 1994 show that despite slight decreases, cocaine remains one of the
most commonly used drugs among adult male arrestees. The percentage of
males testing positive for cocaine in 1994 ranged from 19% (in San Jose) to
68% (in Manhattan). Cocaine positive rates for females ranges from 19%
(in San Diego) to 80% (in Manhattan). While use of cocaine has declined in
the surveyed household and student populations, similar declines have not
been found among arrestees.  Other cities with more than fifty percent of
male arrestees testing positive for cocaine include Atlanta, Birmingham,
Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, and St. Louis. This information was
supplied from the Center for Substance Abuse Research at the University of
Maryland at College Park. To get on their fax list call (301) 403-8329. To

SENATORS CALL FOR CRACKDOWN ON MEXICO:

Saying it is high time for Mexico to crack down on drug trafficking into the
United States, Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Alfonse M. D'Amato,
R-N.Y., last month announced plans for legislation aimed at pressuring
Mexico for increased cooperation. The action comes as the Clinton
administration is poised to extend for  six months Mexico's $20 billion in
U.S. loan guarantees. President Clinton provided the guarantees on his own
authority last Jan. 31, after lawmakers balked at his request that Congress
authorize a $40 billion bailout. "The measures my colleague and I are
introducing are meant as a shot across the bow to the government of
Mexico," Feinstein said. "These measures... should send the signal that this
Congress is prepared to back up the president's effort in the strongest
possible terms if Mexico's actions do not match their words in the war on
drugs." The senators measures would tie the six-month extension of the
loan guarantee to Mexico to that country's efforts to curb drug trafficking.
Specifically, Feinstein said Mexican officials would have to comply with a
list of 10 requirements such as meeting extradition requests, prosecuting
local government officials for accepting graft, strengthening the prohibition
on money laundering and regulating chemicals used to produce
methamphetamine and other narcotics. Another measure would suspend
trucking applications from Mexico under border crossing provisions in the
North American Free Trade Agreement until Mexico improves its safety
record. D'Amato, chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee, said his panel would begin holding hearings and
marking up the draft bill in early March.

MEXICO ARRESTS AND EXTRADITES DRUG TRAFFICKER:

On January 15 the Government of Mexico arrested Juan Garcia Abrego and
the next day expelled him from the country. Garcia Abrego was flown to
Houston and taken into federal custody to face an indictment filed in
September, 1993 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Texas. The indictment charges that Garcia Abrego is the leader of one of the
most powerful drug trafficking organizations in Mexico, which, while
operating on both sides of the border, is responsible for transporting tons of
cocaine into the United States for the Cali Cartel. The indictment further
alleges that Garcia Abrego authorized acts of violence, including murder, to
promote drug activities. Garcia Abrego, who faces a life sentence if he is
convicted, was placed on the FBI's list of "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" in
March of 1995. Attorney General Janet Reno in a statement congratulated
Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations Jose Angel Gurria and Attorney
General Antonio Lozano Garcia for the capture of Garcia Abrego and the
"expeditious manner in which the government of Mexico achieved his
removal from Mexico to the United States."

CALI MONEY LAUNDERERS INDICTED IN NEW JERSEY:

U.S. authorities indicted 14 people accused of laundering $60 million for
the Cali drug cartel and seized large amounts of cash when they arrested
some of the suspects on February 6. In what prosecutors called the biggest
money laundering case brought in New Jersey, special agents of the U.S.
Customs Service and the Internal Revenue Service arrested suspects in three
states beginning the night of February 5, officials said.  Special Agent Dan
Holmes of the U.S. Customs Service said the arrests were made in New
Jersey, New York and Florida and at least $300,000 in cash had been
confiscated. U.S. Attorney Faith Hochberg said in a statement that the
government would ask to have the suspects held without bail because they
pose a high risk of flight. All face a 20-year prison term and a heavy fine if
convicted.  The indictment said the 14 suspects operated through three front
companies, using money transfer agents and banks over more than two
years to launder cash obtained from illegal narcotic sales in the United States
back to Cali, Colombia. One of the companies named was Latelco, with
offices in West New York, New Jersey, Miami and Cali, Colombia. It
ostensibly sold telephone debit cards. A second was a travel and money
transfer agency in Jersey City.

CRIMINAL CHARGES TO BE BROUGHT AGAINST SAMPER:

Colombia's chief prosecutor was quoted on February 6 as saying that he
would file criminal charges against President Ernesto Samper because of his
alleged links to drug lords. The RCN and Caracol radio networks said
Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso announced his plan to file charges
during closed-door talks with members of the Committee of Accusations of
the House of Representatives. Valdivieso could not be reached to confirm
the reports. The committee, the only body formally authorized to investigate
a sitting president, is preparing to reopen a probe into charges that Samper
accepted up to $6 million in Cali cartel drug money to finance his 1994
election campaign. The congressional panel cleared Samper of any
wrongdoing last December after a four-month probe into the campaign
finance scandal his government has been embroiled in since last summer.
But Samper himself asked it to reopen its investigation last week after
Fernando Botero-his former defence minister and campaign boss -
charged that the President personally approved the use of drug money to
bankroll his campaign.

JEWELRY TRADE SHOW AVOIDS PUBLICITY DUE TO CRIME:

After a jewelry trade show participant from Hong Kong was shot and
robbed of nearly $1 million in diamonds outside a midtown Manhattan
hotel, his fellow jewelers hustled their expensive wares into the Jacob K.
Javits Convention Center for a trade show so exclusive it has been almost a
secret.  According to a report from the New York Times, the JA
International Jewelry Show displays no signs outside, disseminates no
general publicity, posts no show dates in lists of upcoming events and
sends out literature in plain brown envelopes. The  reason for the secrecy is
the concern that public notice would weaken security, though none of the
press officers from the parent company, Blenheim Group U.S.A., would
acknowledge this. Many participants covered the badges identifying them as
part of the show, which is intended only for those in the industry. Police
said that they had not yet made any arrests in the shooting. At the Javits
Center a steady stream of armored cars, vans and taxis dropped off
exhibitors bearing bulky crates, bulging briefcases and duffel bags like the
one stolen earlier. Security was heavy. But one show participant said, fear
of theft, combined with other local inconveniences, was causing the show
to lose ground to the June show in Las Vegas. "People hate the cold, the
snow, the theft, the huge cost of hotel rooms. New York has a pretty lousy
reputation."

DEMOCRATS ATTACK NEW YORK'S MAYOR FOR FOCUS ON
CRIME:

Democrats have begun to turn the mayor's success in lowering the crime
rate against him, ridiculing him for concentrating on little else. City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone delivered an unusual reproach to Giuliani in his
annual address to the Council last month, charging that on issues like
education, housing, and health, Giuliani had been "a very good mayor - on
crime." The crime rate may once have been the voters' top priority, but
some New Yorkers are asking "What have you done for me lately?"
Giuliani seemed conscious of the need to broaden his portfolio when, after
the beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, he announced that he would
reorganize the Child Welfare Administration with the same energy and
commitment he had earlier applied to the Police Department. Then he went
further, proclaiming in his budget message last week that his top priority
was protecting the rights of society's most vulnerable, a category he said
included troubled children, the elderly, the sick and the handicapped. To
help pay for some of his new priorities, he agreed to trim the police force by
1,500 officers. Caught off guard, social-welfare advocates praised the
police cut but remained skeptical of the mayor's real intentions, particularly
if budget cuts continue to grow over all, as now seems likely. The budget
plan for next year, for example, includes a $160 million cut to the Board of
Education, and projects the removal of more than 275,000 people from the
welfare rolls.

VETERANS HOSPITALS NOW PROVIDING DRUG TREATMENT:

The Department of Veterans Affairs is best known for its network of
hospitals, which continues to expand despite a decline in the population of
veterans and despite health care trends that are forcing many other hospitals
to close. But now the department's insulation from the fiscal and political
pressures confronting the rest of the government has helped give it an
important new role as an agency that cares for the poor.  And a poor veteran
often gets assistance that a welfare recipient accustomed to nothing more
than cash or food stamps might find lavish.  "If you're a vet," said Martha
Burt, director of social service research at the Urban Institute, a
Washington-based research organization, "you have a resource that a lot of
other people don't have." With the plunge in the number of war-maimed
veterans treated at the agency's 173 hospitals, the VA has been turning more
of its attention to veterans who are among the nation's drug-addicted or
indigent, mentally ill or physically disabled. To qualify, most need only
have put in some time in the service, in combat or not, in wartime or
peacetime. "If you serve 180 days on active duty," said one Republican
congressional aide who specializes in veterans issues, "and if for whatever
reason you do not succeed in life, you get this complete safety net." As a
result, a department that is the nation's largest employer of doctors and
nurses has also become the largest employer of social workers, with 4,241
on the payroll last year.

NOBEL WINNERS TAKE ANTI-VIOLENCE CAMPAIGN TO U.S.:

In a bid to combat teen violence three Nobel peace laureates will take their
message of non-violence to young people, Nobel laureate Betty Williams
announced last month. ``We're going to change things for the young people
of America,'' said Williams, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in
1977 along with Mairead Corrigan Maguire for their work in Northern
Ireland.  Williams next month will kick off in Denver what is expected to be
a five-year educational program known as PeaceJam. Williams later said
gang members will be recruited to attend the weekend conference in late
March. ``We're going to bring them in. We're going to go out and look for
them,'' she said after a press conference to announce the program.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who was awarded the peace prize in 1984 for
his fight against apartheid in South Africa, and the Dalai Lama of Tibet who
received the prize in 1989, will attend similar conferences in Denver later
this year, organizers said.
