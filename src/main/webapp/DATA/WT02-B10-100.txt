<LI>Phase II award from Air Force
</UL>

AdTech Systems Research, Inc.provides research & development, engineering, and technical services to various government agencies and prime contractors. AdTech's expertise is in two interrelated areas: (1) analytical/computer modeling for analysis of materials and structures; and (2) experimental mechanical testing of metals, non-metals, and their composites.<P>

In 1996 AdTech received a Phase II award from the Air Force to continue its work with advanced composite joints. The Air Force and the aerospace industry have identified advanced composites as candidate material systems for a variety of aero propulsion, aero structure, space structure, and airframe components. A number of these applications involve joints, between similar and dissimilar material systems. Some of these are mechanical joints such as bolted and riveted connections. Others are fabricated by welding, brazing, hot isostatic pressing (HIPing), cold isostatic pressing and by a variety of other methods. Often, structural integrity and service life of components containing such joints is limited by the integrity of the joints. Therefore, for design improvement as well as for component life prediction goals, methods are needed which can predict load carrying capacity and life of components containing joints. Under this Phase II SBIR, AdTech is developing a product in the form of a user friendly, interactive, intelligent, computer software package which can be readily used by aerospace engineers to improve the design and evaluation of advanced material joints.<P>

The direct benefit of the Phase II will be a comprehensive design tool for evaluating conceptual designs and optimizing existing designs to maximize the advantages of using composite materials. Industries which could benefit from this advance include aircraft/aerospace; automotive; and power generation.<P>
