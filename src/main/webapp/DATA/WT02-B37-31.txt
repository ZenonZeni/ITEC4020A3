Eco Waste License
Goes to Sweden

Eco Waste Technologies (EWT, 2305 Donley Dr., Suite 108, Austin, TX
78758-4535; Tel: 512/837-9961; Fax: 512/837-9430) has licensed
Chematur Engineering AB of Karlskoga, Sweden to build a major
demonstration supercritical water oxidation facility with a
capacity of 1 gpm. Dick Lyon of Eco Waste says that the
demonstration plant will use the EWT technology that has been in
operation since 1994 at Huntsman Corp. in Austin, Texas.

Lyon reports that EWT has completed an advanced version of its
Huntsman plant for the University of Texas at Austin. This
experimental facility will replace the original pilot plant and
experiment with the treatment of more complex chemicals and sludges
with 20-30% solids from wastewater treatment plants. Its capacity
is 0.5 to 1 gpm.

R.N. McBrayer and J.W. Griffith of EWT disclose that the Huntsman
facility is treating 5 gpm of wastes from experimental chemical
processes and washdowns at Huntsman's Austin Research Labs. The
waste contains about 70% washwater and a mixture from three primary
waste streams of long-chain alcohols, glycols, and amines. The
mixture has a total organic carbon concentration of more than
50,000 mg/l and 6,908 mg/l ammonia. Effluent is required to meet
the pretreatment standards of the city of Austin which means a
monthly average below 100 mg/l organic carbon and less than 20 mg/l
ammonia.

A positive displacement pump pressures the feed to over 24.8 mPa
and passes it through a heat exchanger. The addition of oxygen in
the reactor raises reactor temperatures to 538-650C. Effluent
consisting of water saturated with carbon dioxide passes through
the heat exchanger, a heat recovery boiler, and an effluent cooler
before depressurization to atmospheric pressure in a liquid/gas
separator. Excess oxygen level measurements in the liquid/gas
separator are used to control the oxygen injection rate in the
reactor.

Liquid effluent is held for sampling before discharge. In
continuous operation, the effluent has less than 50 mg/l TOC
consisting of acetic acid or other simple organic acids, and the
chemical oxygen demand is less than 16 mg/l. Ammonia concentrations
are 2.7 to less than 1 mg/l, and nitrate levels are within
acceptable limits at 6.4 mg/l. Dissolved solids consist mostly of
sulfate, chloride, potassium, and sodium salts. Total bicarbonate
at 13,900 mg/l is high because the effluent is saturated with
carbon dioxide from the oxidation of organic matter.

EWT has determined that the alloy used in the Huntsman facility has
resisted corrosion caused by chlorides in feedwater. The unit is
designed for operation 24 h/d and 320 d/yr. It is scheduled for
descaling every 3 weeks using a nitric acid solution to remove
carbonate scale from the heat exchanger. Some pump seals and
packings have been replaced, but McBrayer and Griffith report no
safety-related incidents or problems with reactor operation and
system control in the first year of operations. They conclude that
it has demonstrated the ability to routinely treat the basic C-H-O-
N compounds in chemical process waters.

Catalysts Used to
Promote Oxidation

The University of Tulsa (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Tulsa, OK
74104) has demonstrated an effective method of destroying organic
compounds contained within an aqueous waste stream.  Catalytic
supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is effective in the
destruction of the original organic compound. Incomplete conversion
to low molecular weight partial oxidation products may be achieved.

For years, wet oxidation has been successfully used as a
destructive treatment for many organic species.  Increased
destruction efficiency has been obtained by increasing the reaction
temperature to that above the critical temperature of water or
through the addition of a catalyst.  During SCWO, advantage is
gained in that the organic components and the oxygen are all
present in a single, dense, fluid phase, minimizing mass transfer
resistance and providing relatively rapid reaction rates.

The oxidation of phenol is of practical interest since it is a
common pollutant in industrial waste streams and is also believed
to be an intermediate product in the oxidation pathway of higher
molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons.  Catalytic wet oxidation of
phenol over a CuO catalyst has been previously investigated.  The
reaction kinetics were determined and were thought to proceed
through a homogeneous-heterogeneous mechanism.  The homogeneous
reaction pathway caused an induction period during which free
radicals were accumulated in the aqueous phase.  Numerous reaction
intermediates, including benzoquinones, acetic acid, and other low
molecular weight organic acids, have been identified.

Some of the products identified from supercritical water oxidation
of phenol represent compounds that are more hazardous than the
starting organic component.  In order to minimize the formation of
these partial oxidation products and to promote complete
conversion, it is feasible to either increase the reaction
temperature or add a catalyst.

The University of Tulsa study, published in Environmental Science
& Technology [29, 2748-2753, 1995], gives a more detailed analysis
of the use of a heterogeneous catalyst to promote the oxidation of
phenol.  Several partial oxidation products have been identified,
and a reaction model involving a sequence of parallel and series
reaction pathways has been developed.  The performance of several
heterogeneous catalysts has been compared.

Discarded Medical
Materials Disinfected

Engineers at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI, 6220 Culebra
Rd., P.O. Drawer 28510, San Antonio, TX 78228-0510; Tel: 210/684-
5111) are testing the efficiency of a new medical waste treatment
system manufactured by Med Compliance Services (MCS, El Paso Dr.,
El Paso, TX 79905; Tel: 915/772-2288).  The Encore-2100 system
first shreds the material, reducing its volume, then disinfects the
waste by exposure to a chlorine dioxide solution.  The chemical
treatment system is an alternative to incineration processes which
have traditionally been used to dispose of medical waste but have
been threatened by the scheduled implementation of federal
regulations.

The EPA estimates that 3.4 million tons of waste are produced
annually by U.S. health care facilities.  Hospitals are the single
largest generator of that waste, contributing some 70% of the total
in the form of contaminated dressings, biopsy specimens, laboratory
wastes, needles and syringes, and blood and blood products.  About
3,000 hospitals now use incinerators as their primary means of
medical waste disposal.

The problem is that, as required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, the EPA has issued a proposed rule, to be finalized by April
15, 1996, that would impose stringent pollution control
requirements on medical waste incinerator operators to reduce toxic
waste emissions such as dioxins and metals.  Implementation of the
control measure is expected to significantly increase equipment and
operating costs, making on-site incineration economically
impractical for many hospitals.  Some waste treatment industry
sources estimate that the rule could force the closure of 80-90% of
existing medical waste incinerators.

James Scott, senior research engineer, has led the SwRI effort to
design test protocols for and perform third party, independent
testing of the Encore-2100 system to assess its compliance with
standards established by the EPA and the State and Territorial
Association of Alternate Treatment Technologies (STAATT), a
consortium of state medical waste regulators.  The Encore-2100,
with a maximum production rate of 2,000 lbs./hr., is designed to
effectively and safely treat infectious waste so the processed
materials can be disposed of in a conventional solid waste
landfill, says Scott.  Two specially configured industrial
shredders in series reduce waste volume significantly and enhance
contact between al the waste components and the chlorine dioxide
solution, which is introduced during and after shredding.

Chlorine dioxide, the key component in the chemical disinfecting
solution, is commonly used to treat drinking water and wastewater.
It can be generated through a reaction involving sodium
hypochlorite, hydrochloric acid, and sodium chlorite solutions, or
by mixing gaseous chlorine and sodium chlorite solutions.  The
method used in the Encore-2100 technology involves a reaction of
the chemicals under vacuum to create gaseous chlorine dioxide.

The key feature of the gas generation system, manufactured by Rio
Linda Chemical Co. (North 10th St., Sacramento, CA 95814; Tel:
916/443-4939), is its single ejector, which creates a vacuum,
bringing the premeasured chemicals together to form gaseous
chlorine dioxide, and introduces the gas into an aqueous solution.
The disinfecting solution is removed from the waste using a
helipress and then recirculated and returned to the desired
concentration prior to reuse in the treatment process.  Release of
airborne contaminants is controlled by a high efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) filter and scrubber units.

Scott explains the SwRI designated two protocols to measure the
effectiveness of the Encore-2100 system.  One protocol tests the
system relative to EP requirements for sanitizing inanimate,
nonfood contact surfaces.  This part of the study is being
conducted in accordance with EPA Good Laboratory Practices.  The
second protocol subjects the Encore-2100 to national standards
developed by STAATT.  To satisfy these standards, the system must
demonstrate a 99.9999% reduction in selected microorganism species
representing vegetative bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, and
tubercle mycobacteria.  In addition, the process must demonstrate
a 99.99% reduction in bacterial spores, including highly resistant
forms of Bacillus.

SwRI incorporated stringent quality assurance controls to encompass
all aspects of the study, including sources and culturing of the
microorganisms, processing of waste through the Encore-2100 system,
and microbiological analyses of the samples.  Quality assurance
documents generated during the study validate the sample results
and allow the complete reproduction of the experimental results.
SwRI has collected about 150 samples from the Encore-2100 process.
 The first commercial unit will be installed at an existing MCS
facility in Albuquerque, NM.

Hydrothermal Oxidation
of Chemical Weapons

The Dept. of Defense (DOD) and General Atomics (3550 General
Atomics Ct., San Diego, CA 92121; Tel: 619/455-3000, Fax: 619/455-
2263) demonstrated that a hydrothermal oxidation (HTO) technology
can safely destroy chemical weapons and solid rocket propellants
without incineration. HTO uses water heated to 500F  and
pressurized to 4000 psi to mix oxygen or air with organic
contaminants, forming carbon dioxide, water, and sometimes, mineral
salts or acids.  No harmful emissions are produced and all end
products can be safely disposed of, recycled, or released.

According to Jeff Broido of General Atomics, the unit destroys the
nerve agents VX, GB and mustard gas beyond the limits of detection.
Research is looking into how to deal with the heavy amounts of
chlorine generated, and the corrosion it brings, when destroying
such weapons.

While water usually repels such materials, the pressure and heat
allow it to mix and oxidize.  Broido says that the trick is that
the water's behavior is reversed.  It behaves like a non-polar
solvent. The bench-scale HTO unit General Atomics operates in San
Diego is being used to test a variety of hazardous materials for
commercial use.

Iron Curtain Holds
Back Contamination

Hydrogeologist Robert Gillham of the University of Waterloo Centre
for Groundwater Research (Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) continues
research on a permeable subsurface treatment wall containing iron
filings and sand to purify contaminated groundwater. Last fall
articles first began appearing in the scientific literature on the
use of iron filing walls to keep out toxic wastes. Since then, this
new technology has been rapidly attracting attention as an
economically competitive tool for groundwater remediation and
treatment.

Gillham's wall, located at a test site in Waterloo, separates two
water bodieson one side is contaminated groundwateron the other,
water almost clean enough to drink.  Goundwater contaminated with
volatile organic compounds flows through the wall naturally, and a
chemical reaction purifies the water.  The process could be used at
thousands of hazardous waste sites needing remediation, according
to Gillham.

Gillham started to develop the method when he noticed
irregularities in water samples taken from plastic-lined wells.
The plastic absorbed contaminants and biased water quality
measurement.  Samples taken from wells with metal casings showed
even lower contaminant levels without absorption into the metal.

The reason for this phenomenon was corrosion.  The contaminant
reacts with iron, forming harmless byproducts, including chloride,
ethene, and ethane.  The reaction leaves no waste material to
contain, transport, and dispose.  With a high enough iron content,
contaminated groundwater can be treated to meet drinking water
standards.

Gillham has used a 20% iron concentration for more than four years
at the test site to treat groundwater contaminated with 250 mg/L of
trichloroethylene (TCE) and 45 mg/L of tetrachloroethylene (PCE)
with no detectable deterioration of the medium.  Although the
treated water does not meet drinking water standards, Gillham says
this could be possible if a higher concentration of iron were used.

To use the corrosive reaction for groundwater cleanup, the
direction and depth of the contaminated flow must be known, a
trench dug, and the reactive formulation placed in the hole.  The
iron and sand wall has a higher permeability than the surrounding
soil, allowing the contaminated groundwater to flow freely through
the reactive material.  Residence times, depending on the
concentration of the contaminant, are about two days.

During the reaction, pH increases and minerals precipitate out of
the water to form calcium carbonate, which could clog the media and
cause the groundwater to flow around the wall.  To restore
permeability, the iron filings can be stirred to increase porosity.
Inorganic mineral precipitates cause 2-15% losses in porosity per
year.  Spent iron can be replaced.  No stirring or media
replacement is expected to be needed for at least 10 years at the
test site.

Capital costs for installing the treatment wall system are
comparable to pump and treat methods.  The only operation and
maintenance costs, other than periodic groundwater sampling, could
involve stirring up the media, according to John Vogan, manager of
EnviroMetal Technologies (42 Arrow Rd., Guelph, Ontario N1K 1S6
Canada; Tel: 519/824-0432), a company set up by Gillham to market
the patented technology.  A 180 meter long by 9 meter deep (600' x
30') funnel and gate system to treat 50-60 mg/L TCE and 10 mg/L PCE
in a high velocity aquifer would cost about $1.5 million.

Waste Stays Behind
Wall of Iron Filings

A proposed wall of iron filings to protect four Massachusetts towns
from contaminated water coming from the former Massachusetts
Military Reservation was first described in an article in Science
[269, 473, 1995]. Unlike slurry walls and similar physical
barriers, the iron filings will form a permeable but reactive
barrier to break down trichlorethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and
other chlorinated contaminants.

This proposed iron (Fe) barrier is a product of continuing research
into methods to treat groundwater contaminants in place without the
usual pump-and-treat operations. Engineers in Oklahoma have
conducted lab tests which explain how iron filings can reduce
Cr(VI) in groundwater to Cr(III).  Robert M. Powell (ManTech
Environmental Research Services Corp., P.O. Box 1198, Ada, OK
74821-1198), Robert W. Puls, Sharon K. Hightower, and David A.
Sabatini conducted stirred batch reactor experiments in darkened
500 ml reactors with simulated aquifer water, scrap iron filings,
and alluvial aquifer material.

The competitive desorption of CrO4-2 from surface absorption sites
by excess PO4-3 resulted in nearly full recovery of chromium from
experiments without iron filings. In experiments with iron filings,
chromium was reduced from 109 mg/l to below 0.3 mg/l and there was
no subsequent CrO4-2 recovery by PO4-3 desorption, confirming
reduction by iron. Powell's group found that different forms of
metallic iron have greatly different abilities to reduce chromate.
Impure and partially oxidized iron is the most effective.

Powell's observations of changes support the theory that an
electrochemical corrosion cell on the surface of an iron filing
causes the thermodynamic instability that drives oxidation-
reduction reactions without external energy input. Iron in the
zero-valence state is an electron donor, and chromate ions serve as
oxidants in such cells. Powell wrote in Environmental Science &
Technology [29-8, 1913-1921, 1995] that the corrosion cell is a
stable domain with clearly defined anodic and cathodic regions.

Differences in the surface potential of impure iron filings due to
composition or grain structure and orientation result in unstable
regions and electron movement. Previously rusted surfaces are sites
of dissolution where potentially unfilled electron shells exist
next to filled electron shells, and reaction rates are high. An
anodic region develops where there is an electron deficiency, and
it has a positive charge and Fe++ ions at the surface. They are free
to enter the solution.

Powell suggests that the positively charged zone electrostatically
attracts chromate and sulfate ions, promoting formation of the
Fe2SO4 complex and redox coupling of chromate ions. The negatively
charged cathodic region of the surface is dominated by cations and
non reducible sodium and calcium ions. Aluminosilicates in aquifers
are able to provide electron acceptors to maintain the dissolution
of iron surfaces.

In the case of the Massachusetts project, Fe++ ions in corrosion
cells on iron filings would strip chlorine ions from chlorinated
hydrocarbons in moving groundwater and turn them into harmless
ethene and ethane. Summary report EPA542-S-95-001 from the Solid
Waste Office of the Environmental Protection Agency states that
four demonstration projects are using metal-enhanced dehalogenation
under a patent held by the University of Waterloo.

Creative Techniques
Help Landfill Problem

Trial and error has been the "engineering" method used to develop
some of the most effective landfill management techniques.  This
has also been the case at Florida's Citrus County Landfill, where
erosion control has been aggravating operators since the facility
opened in January 1990.  The landfill is located in west-central
Florida, approximately 15 miles east of the Gulf of Mexico.

The current plan, a 17-acre plastic-lined cell, is the first of six
phases designed to last 30 years.  With a surface elevation of 120
ft. above sea level and a depth of 80 ft., the landfill is unique
in Florida, where shallow water tables can limit excavation depths.
Side slopes, three of which are lined, are a steep 2:1 (horizontal
to vertical) ratio.  The unlined side contains an entrance road
extending down into the cell.

Although ditches were used on the unlined slope to control erosion,
maintenance was a continuous nightmare.  Attempts to hydroseed
mulch were ruined by rainstorms that washed away the seed before it
took root.  The rain also formed gullies which deepened with each
storm.  The landfill was kept open only by periodically
reconstructing the slopes using bulldozers to excavate eroded soils
from the stormwater pond.

After a catastrophic 11 inch rainfall laid waste to slopes that had
been restored only months before, stapled sod was installed over
burlap cloth on all unlined slopes.  The solution has required only
minor maintenance since installation two years agohelping to make
the costly $4/sq. yd. installation price palatable.

When the price of sod can't be justified, operators use seed and
seaweed mulch on slopes that are angled at 4:1 or flatter.  Citrus
County used hydrilla and water hyacinth removed from nearby canals
to enrich the soil and facilitate seed germination by retaining
moisture.

The liners required by law have also contributed to the landfill's
erosion problems.  Erosion tends to occur at the edge of liners,
since the synthetic liner sheds nearly 100% of contacted
stormwater.  Sheet flow concentrates at the bottom of the line and
erosion occurs where flows become concentrated on steep slopes.
When the soil layer next to the liner is eroded away, solid waste
can become exposed and contaminate the stormwater.  Fortunately,
erosion can be controlled at the liner edge by constructing a ditch
lined with plastic sheeting.  Costs for manpower and equipment are
about $4.60/linear foot of ditch.

Officials at Citrus County landfill prefer a lined ditch to sod or
staked sod with burlap because it will stand up to most any flow
velocity.  Lined ditches also provide a barrier to leachate and do
not have to be watered or mowed.  LDPE sheets work well when
applied in 60 foot sections or longer.  A woven, coated, 3-ply
geomembrane of LDPE with carbon black for ultraviolet light
resistance is available for about $1.17/sq. yd. for 16 mils and
$1.80/sq. yd. for 20 mils.

Million Dollar
Challenge Extended

The results from Monsanto's (800 N. Lindbergh Blvd., St. Louis, MO
63141; Tel: 314/694-1000) first One Million Dollar Challenge were
so encouraging, the company is bringing the program out for an
encore.  Another one million dollars will be awarded to the
individual or team that develops the most cost-effective and
commercially practical technology for producing a clean sodium
chloride stream while recovering high purity amino acids and both
phosphoric and phosphorous acids from a complex wastewater stream.

The initiative supplements Monsanto's ongoing internal program to
eliminate waste and strengthen environmental performance.  An
independent group of experts from the Center for Waste Reduction
technologies (part of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers)
will evaluate the proposals submitted in response to the second

Decrying Cement
Kiln Absolution

One month after the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
(TNRCC) released a study that absolved Midlothian's cement and
steel plants of producing hazardous emissions, activists have
expressed skepticism over the study results.

Sue Pope, leader of the environmental group Downwinders at Risk,
was one of about 300 residents who attended the TNRCC's meeting in
Midlothian.  State officials at the meeting reviewed results of
their soil-and-air samples study, which has been conducted in the
Midlothian area since 1991.

The report summarized the results of over a thousand samples
collected which indicated that exposure to the monitored levels are
not likely to result in adverse health effects. Where relevant
comparison data were available, air and soil concentrations
measured in Midlothian were found to be similar to those measured
in other Texas communities.

But Pope said her family's deteriorating health is proof enough
that the emissions from Midlothian's steel and cement industries
are harmful.  Pope said the family had some very unexplained
illnesses that began in 1986.  Pope's own health problems since
1986 have included malignant tumors, endometriosis, respiratory
problems, chronic fatigue and autoimmune disorders.  She said her
family's livestock has developed mysterious problems as well,
including cancer, tumors and high numbers of multiple births.  The
Midlothian area also has a higher-than-normal occurrence of
children born with Down's syndrome and adults with cancer and
tumors, Pope said.

The TNRCC's study detailed how 176 soil samples were conducted at
160 sites in and around Midlothian, Center, Carthage, Cleburne,
Terrell and Quitman for polychlorinated dibenzodioxin and
polychlorinated dibenzofuran concentrations.  They found no
significant emissions or high levels of toxins.  Additionally, the
state agency conducted a screening risk analysis for Midlothian's
Texas Industries Inc. (TXI) plant and concluded that based on the
estimated emissions and the assumptions made during this analysis,
the excess lifetime carcinogenic risks and non-cancer hazards that
result for exposure to contaminants potentially emitted from the
Texas Industries Inc. facility are considered to be within an
acceptable range.

But Pope and other residents do not believe the TNRCC's study went
far enough in trying to determine potential health risks from
emissions.  She questioned why a screening analysis, rather than a
health-risk assessment, was conducted about TXI's emissions.  Pope
and others believe that the study's results were released at this
time to hush up the subject and may have been due to political
pressure from the Republican-led state legislature and governor's
office.  Downwinders at Risk has asked the EPA to investigate
emission levels from Midlothian's industries, and expect
preliminary results of the study within a few weeks.

BFI Plans on
One-Time Charge

Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. (BFI, 757 N. Eldridge Pkwy.,
Houston, TX 77079; Tel: 713/870-8100 ) announced plans to record a
one-time charge of $0.05/share in its second quarter, ending March
31, from the redemption of $745 million in debt.   The company said
it called its $400 million of 6-3/4% convertible subordinated
debentures due 2005 and its $345 million of 6-1/4% convertible
subordinated debentures due 2012 for redemption on February 2,
1996.

BFI said it believes the redemption will enhance shareholder value
because the debentures would have been convertible for about 16
million shares of the company's common stock.  The redemption also
allows the company to refinance the debt at more favorable rates,
the company said.

The 6-1/4% debentures will be redeemed for 101.25% of face value
plus accrued interest, with a conversion price of $41 per share.
The 6-3/4% debentures will be redeemed for 101.00% of face value
plus accrued interest, with a conversion price of $52.50/share.

The announcement comes two weeks after Browning-Ferris filed a
shelf registration for $1 billion in debt and equity securities.

VECTRA Delays Its
EnviroGlass Startup

VECTRA Technologies Inc. (1010 S. 336th St., No. 220, Federal Way,
WA 98003; Tel: 206/874-2235, Fax: 206/874-2401) said Thursday it is
temporarily suspending all construction and startup activities
associated with its EnviroGlass vitrification program.

VECTRA, which supplies technology and services to the power
industry, said suspending the vitrification program will have a
near-term positive effect on cash flow since the company expected
to spend a considerable amount of money to complete and transport
the unit.

The company said that it is too soon to tell if the suspension will
have any serious long-term effects.  VECTRA said suspending the
vitrification program was necessary because delays in placing its
transportable vitrification unit at its lead client's site made it
impossible to meet the client's schedule to dispose of the low-
level waste.  VECTRA is now negotiating to remove and process the
waste on a subcontract basis.   However, if it is not successful in
these negotiations, VECTRA may be forced to accept contract
cancellation.

The company said it will be actively pursuing new contracts for the
vitrification technology and if VECTRA wins another project, the
program will be reactivated.   VECTRA also said it continues its
previously announced program to sell assets or raise additional
capital in an effort to eliminate long-term bank debt by the first
quarter of 1996.

Committee Approves
EPA's Use of TEFs

The Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Science Advisory Board
has supported the agency's use of "toxic equivalency factors"
(TEFs) in a draft review of dioxin risk reassessment.  TEFs are
calculations that equate dioxin with several other dioxin-like
chemicals (polychlorinated biphenyls, for example) to assess human
health risks.

Although individual board members questioned the use of TEFs, the
committee supported the calculations as the best available tool for
risk assessment.  A peer review of TEF that would focus on
interactions between chemicals that affect toxicity was suggested
by the committee, however. The agency is revising the dioxin
reassessment and expects to report to the board next year.

DOI Incurs
Rath of EPA

The Dept. of the Interior (DOI) has incurred the wrath of the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by operating a hazardous
waste facility without a permit at an Indian reservation.  The DOI
stored over 2000 gal. of ignitable hazardous waste containing
chromium and lead at its Fort Defiance Navajo Agency facility (Fort
Defiance, AZ), some of it for more than 10 years.

The EPA is recommending a $269,019 fine for this violation of the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and demanded DOI move
the waste to a treatment, storage or disposal facility within 30
days.  The EPA recently cited DOI for a similar violation in
another part of Arizona.

Lessor Responsible
for Sham Operation

In the late 1980s, Asphalt Recovery Systems (Chicago, IL) began
piling asphalt debris on a seven-acre site in Chicago leased from
D. Raymond Shane.  The company claimed to be stockpiling the
material to recycle for road patching work.  In 1989, the city sued
Asphalt Recovery for operating a landfill on a site without a
permit and won a $4.8 million judgment for cleanup costs.

After Asphalt Recovery went out of business in 1993 leaving no
usable assets, the city sued Shane, contending that he had a duty
to check up on his tenant.  Having failed to do so, Shane was, in
the city's eyes, responsible for any environmental damage.  The
city code contains a provision in place that assigns financial
responsibility for environmental cleanups to landlords.

A Cook County circuit court judge ruled that, under the city code,
Shane was responsible for cleaning up the 300,000 tons of debris on
his property.  Henry Henderson, Chicago's environmental
commissioner, said that the decision sends a clear message to
unscrupulous operators masquerading as recyclers that they are
operating under a false assumption if they believe they can dump
their trash in Chicago and let taxpayers clean it up. Shane's
attorney has promised an appeal.

EPA Discovers
Something Fishy

A 20% increase in the number of fish consumption advisories were
reported by state health agencies during fiscal 1994, according to
a survey compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The agency reported that 46 states have issued advisories, and
seven have statewide noticesFlorida, Maine, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and New York.  Since the survey was
compiled, New Hampshire and Vermont have also issued statewide
advisories.

Fourteen percent of US lakes, 4% of U.S. rivers, all of the Great
Lakes, and most coastline are currently under advisories.  More
than 60% of the advisories are for mercury, primarily from coal-
burning power plants, incinerators, and industrial sites.  Other
contaminants triggering advisories include polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), the pesticide chlordane, DDT, dioxin, and other
toxic substances that can accumulate in fish tissue.

The increase in advisories does not necessarily mean that lakes and
rivers are more pollutedit could signal an expansion of state
monitoring and assessment efforts.  Minnesota, for example, listed
565 advisories, more than double that of any other state.

And simply because a state has more waterbodies under advisory does
not mean that these states have the worst fish contaminant
problems.  According to Jeff Bigler of the EPA's Office of Water,
the high number of advisories more likely characterize both the
level of effort put into identifying waterbodies of concern and the
assessment methods used by the state for developing fish
consumption advisories.

Bigler says that the criteria for issuing an advisory often varies
from one state to another, with different thresholds used as the
basis for issuing advisories.  EPA Administrator Carol Browner
announced the release of a new EPA database, the National Listing
of Fish Consumption Advisories, during a speech at the American
Fisheries Society in Tampa, FL.  The database includes information
on the types of advisories, the species of fish affected, the
chemicals included in the advisory, locations, dates of issue, and
contact names and telephone numbers.  Maps allow users to select
between regions, states, chemicals, species, and a number of other
parameters for narrowing an advisory search.

The National Listing of Fish Consumption Advisories is available to
the public on five computer disks and will be upgraded annually.
The listing also is available on the Internet at
http://www.epa.gov/water.

GAC Improves
Biofilter Effect

A team of researchers from the National Tsing Hua University (Hsin
Chu, Taiwan, ROC) and Union Chemical Labs (ITRI, Hsin Chu, Taiwan,
ROC) have joined together to systematically investigate the
transient behavior of biofilters during shut down, restart
operations and shock loading.  Toluene was used as the gas
pollutant in the study.

Biodegradation processes have been validated as a promising
alternative to other conventional air pollution control
technologies.  Toluene is a toxic air pollutant and a common
constituent emitted from many industrial processes, such as
chemical manufacturing, painting, and petroleum refining.  An
economically feasible control method would be advantageous in light
of increasingly stringent regulation for air emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs).

With the easily biodegradable nature of toluene, biofiltration of
air emissions containing this pollutant is considered a preferable
alternative to other traditional physical and chemical air
pollution control methods, including scrubbing, incineration, and
activated carbon adsorption.  Advantages of this process include
low investment and operating costs, high removal efficiency and
reliable operational stability.  Furthermore, high destruction
efficiency of the pollutant in the biofilter causes no secondary
pollution.

Biofiltration can be described as a process that utilizes microbial
activity for the aerobic degradation of pollutants.  A biofilter
contains filter materials (mainly compost or peat) on which
microorganisms are immobilized to form a biolayer.  When waste
gases pass through the reactor, target pollutants diffuse into the
biofilm with subsequent aerobic biodegradation.  In general,
natural filter materials provide sufficient inorganic nutrients for
microorganisms, thus the addition of inorganic nutrients is not
required.

In the Taiwan study, experiments were conducted in three
laboratory-scale biofilters with mixtures of chaff/compost,
diatomaceous earth (DE)/compost, and granular activated carbon
(GAC)/compost, respectively, as the filter materials.  The response
of each biofilter to shock loading was studied by abruptly changing
the concentration or flow rate of the inlet gas.  For each
transient operation, toluene concentration was continuously
measured until a new steady state was achieved.

According to their report, published in Hazardous Waste & Hazardous
Materials [12, 3, 1995], the researchers found that the biofilters
responded effectively to the shut down and restart operation and
shock loading of toluene concentration or gas flow rate.  In
addition, the highly adsorptive GAC could improve the biofilter
performance, especially for the treatment of less water soluble
compounds.  The GAC/compost biofilter had the highest maximum
elimination capacity of 97 (g hr-1m-3).

Essex Team Treats
Landfill Leachate

High concentrations of sulfate in wastewater streams subjected to
anaerobic digestion have been considered undesirable because of the
production of sulfide during digestion, which can inhibit
methanogenesis.  It has been reported that a >76% removal of
organic COD is possible when high sulfate wastewater (from an
edible fat manufacturer) was anaerobically digested, although only
21-45% overall COD was removed because of sulfide remaining in the
effluent.

Appreciable sulfate may be present normally in effluents, and
anaerobic digestion results in low biogas formation and high
concentrations of sulfide in the effluent.  Anaerobic digestion has
also been successful in removing high sulfate concentrations from
mine waters and contaminated groundwater.

Scientists at the University of Essex (Dept. of Biology, Colchester
CO4 3SQ, England) have finished a study in which landfill leachate
was treated in upflow hybrid (sludge-bed/fixed-bed) anaerobic
reactors by both methanogenic digestion and by sulfate-reducing
digestion (Water Resources; 30, 1, 1996).

The University of Essex study achieved steady state removal
efficiencies of COD under methanogenic digestion of 81-97%,
depending upon organic loading rate; and effective treatment
occurred up to a volumetric COD loading rate of 3.75 kg COD m-3 d-1.
In sulfate-reducing digesters SO24- was converted stoichiometrically
to dissolve H2S, driving organic matter mineralization.  Sulfate
concentrations of 35, 105 and 175 mM in the feed resulted in SO24-
removal efficiencies of 92, 52 and 35%, respectively.

Steady state removal efficiencies of organic COD in the sulfate-
reducing digesters averaged 62% at 35mM, 80% at 105 mM, and 84% at
175 mM feed SO24- concentrations.  The ratio of COD:SO24- (g/g)
utilized was dependent upon the concentration of SO24- present, and
at 35 M SO24- was 0.67.

At an organic loading rate <1 kg COD m-3 d-1 the sulfate reducing
digesters offered organic removal efficiencies comparable to
methanogenic digesters, but were less effective at higher loading
rates.  Propionate accounted for the majority of the residual COD
in the effluents from the methanogenic digesters, but acetate in
the effluent from the sulfate-reducing digesters.

Removal of sulfide from the reactors was achieved by addition of
iron and by off gassing sulfides, but there was no increase in COD
removal after sulfide removal which indicated that sulfide toxicity
was not significant.  Both methanogenic and sulfate-reducing
reactors completely removed up to 100 ppm Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn added
in the feed, indicating that even methanogenic reactors produce
sufficient sulfide to precipitate these metals completely.

Oak Ridge Technology
License Is Available

A method for the destruction of chlorinated volatile organic
compounds (CVOCs), especially trichloroethylene (TCE) and
chloroform, using vapor phase off-gas treatment is available for
licensing from the Dept. of Energys (DOE) Oak Ridge National Lab,
Earth and Atmospheric Environmental Sciences Division.

The process can be used for both groundwater and soil remediation.
A basic bench scale proof of principle apparatus has been
constructed and tested.  The principal advantages of the process
are expected to be high efficiency, cost effectiveness, and minimal
production of secondary waste.  In addition, production systems
based on this technology are expected to be very compact for a
rather large capacity of CVOCs, should not be subject to fouling,
and are expected to require very minimal maintenance.

Commercial firms interested in procuring a license for this
technology may obtain more detailed technical information about the
invention by requesting and executing a Proprietary Information
Agreement (PIA).  To request a PIA, please contact James R. Palmer,
licensing executive at Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, Inc. (Office

Barrier Coatings
Lower Pollution

Nanostructured thermal barrier coatings for use on high efficiency,
low emission, natural gas-fired turbines are the subject of a
research project at Nanomaterials Research Corp. (NRC, 10960 N.
Stallard Place, Tucson, AZ 85737; Tel: 602/575-1354).  The ready
availability of clean natural gas at low prices accelerating the
use of gas turbines.  Over the next 10 years, NRC scientist Tapesh
Yadav projects advanced gas turbines and combined cycles will
account for about 45% of additions to global power generation
capacity.  In order to operate at minimum emission and high
efficiency levels, such equipment will require materials than can
withstand the anticipated high inlet and operating temperatures and
contain the pollutant-laden exhaust.

Nanostructured coatings, which are capable of withstanding the
additional heat, are based on powders with nanoscale dimensions in
the 10-7 - 10-9 meter range.  Such materials could be used in turbine
combustor, blades, vanes, and transition pieces.

Ceramic, Metal Bond
for Hot Gas Filters

Intumescent materials for joining ceramics to metals at high
temperatures in hot gas filtration systems have been formulated by
scientists at CeraMem Corp. (12 Clematis Ave., Waltham, MA 02154-
7035; Tel: 617/899-0467).  Other potential applications for the
materials include heat exchangers, high temperature vehicle
emissions control systems, and heat protection and control systems
for new jet engines.

The cost effective sealing of ceramic components such as
particulate filters to high temperature metal alloys in advanced
coal-based power systems operating at temperatures of up to 1000C
is extremely difficult, reports Robert J. Higgins.  The problem
stems from the large disparity in thermal expansion coefficients of
these two types of materials.

This requirement to seal large gaps between ceramic and metallic
components, coupled with the need to maintain appropriate stress
levels on the ceramic components at all temperatures, places
extreme demands on the properties of the material used to seal the
ceramic-metal gap.  Similar systems operating at lower temperatures
utilize vermiculite-based intumescent mats for this purpose, but
such materials have limited lifetimes when used at temperatures in
excess of 500C and degrade at temperatures above 800C.

CeraMem scientists are investigating the use of multilayer,
biceramic composites that can reversibly expand and contract
between room temperature and 1000C.  These composites will include
various combinations of high temperature oxides fabricated by the
surface modification treatment of thin, tape cast ceramic sheets.

New and Retrofit
Coal Combustor

A new, ultralow nitrogen oxides (NOx) pulverized coal combustor is
under development by engineers at Busek Co., Inc. (19 Kearney Rd.,
Needham, MA 02194-2505; Tel: 508/655-5565). The concept, reports
Vladimir Hruby, is applicable to both new and retrofit wall- and
tangentially-fired utility and industrial boiler systems.

The process focuses on a new method of controlling the
stoichiometry, kinetics, and fuelbound nitrogen evolution in the
fuel devolatilization and initial combustion stages.  An extremely
fuel-rich reaction zone is sustained by the low temperature, highly
oxidizing plasma environment.  The plasma contains highly reactive
oxygen radicals and permits fuel devolatilization at
stoichiometries where fuelbound nitrogen conversion to compounds
other than oxides are favored.

The power consumption required to create the plasma is less than
0.5% of the thermal input of the combustor.  Thermal management
techniques for primary zone combustion limit the formation of
thermal NOx, which results in NOx emissions several times lower
than those in commercially available low NOx burners.  The first
part of the Busek project will involve the expansion of earlier
experience with the plasma ignition and rapid devolatilization of
coal, followed by the demonstration of the new concept.
Experiments will be performed to measure NOx emissions and power
consumption as a basis for the design of a 6 million Btu/hr.
combustor.  Later, the combustor will be built and tested in a
commercial boiler.

Turbine Emissions
Are Reduced

An advanced technology catalytic combustor (ATCC) for application
on ground-base, natural gas-powered turbine engines is under
construction at Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI, 25 Science Park,
New Haven, CT 06511-1968; Tel: 203/786-5215).

William C. Pfefferle reports that the ATCC will represent an
ultrahigh efficiency, environmentally superior, cost competitive
technology.  He predicts that design innovations will overcome the
limits of earlier catalytic combustion designs and result ultralow
emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) of one
and five parts per million (ppm), respectively.

PCI will first build at least one laboratory prototypes for
demonstration at atmospheric pressure and will then explore design
variations.  Subsequently, a full scale combustor will be built for
demonstration at full pressure in preparation for testing on an
engine. High combustion stability, operability without a preburner,
high turndown, and durability are said to be other advantages of
the ATCC.

Plastics Council
Focuses on Reuse

There are several challenges unique to the recycling of plastics,
including the difficulties associated with identification and
separation, high contamination levels, and costly equipment.  In an
effort to reduce the effect of these problems and boost recovery
rates, the American Plastics Council (APC, 1275 K St., NW,
Washington, DC 20005; Tel: 800/243-5790) is investing in innovative
technologies.

In 1994, the APC opened the Multi-Products Recycling Facility
(MPRF) in Boston, MAthe first large-scale U.S. research and
development facility for plastics recycling.  The facility
transforms plastic contaminated with materials such as metals and
fabric into clean, reusable plastics.  To date, the facility has
processed more than 100,000 lbs. of used plastics from automobiles,
computers, business equipment, and appliances.

Last spring, a new project, operated by MBA Polymers Inc. (829
Heinz Ave., Berkeley, CA; Tel: 510/704-7585) and sponsored by the
APC, was started in Berkeley, CAthe Advanced Plastics Recycling
Pilot Line Facility.  This 10,000 sq. ft. plant aims to develop and
demonstrate advanced mechanical recycling technologies for
plastics.  Specific goals include improving recycling economics by
increasing throughput and reducing capital costs; cleaner post-
processed plastics; and investigation of new separation processes.

The pilot recycling line is reported to process all types of
plastic materials including those containing foreign materials such
as ferrous and nonferrous metals, labels, foam, and wiring.  High
temperature, high pressure water is used to remove paints and
coatings.

Another goal of the APC is to improve identification methods for
used plastics.  For example, the P/ID 28, a near-infrared
instrument developed by Bruker Instruments Inc. (15 Fortune Dr.,
Billerica, MA; Tel: 508/667-9580), under APC sponsorship, is
reported to classify at least 23 different types of plastic,
including black plastics, which are generally difficult to
identify.  The P/ID 28 uses the unique make-up of different
plastics, primarily the long chains of specific chemical species
which determine plastic type, as well as its mechanical, chemical
and physical properties.  When infrared light impinges on the
various chemical species along a polymer chain, they vibrate at
different frequencies, absorbing energy at wave lengths that are
characteristic of specific types of plastic.

Memphis May
Achieve Goal

Recycling appears to be a Memphis, TN growth industry.  With three
new initiatives under way, the local recycling business seems to be
on the verge of a boom.  Construction of the city's $3 million
recycling center has just begun, while the community's curbside
recycling recently spread to another 40,000 homes in the Midtown
area.  Champion Recycling Corp. (4939 Gasmer Dr., Houston, TX
77035; Tel: 713/723-6397, Fax: 713/723-3648) has launched a city-
wide recycling program in Memphis businesses as well as public and
private schools, churches and community centers.

All this activity is expected to help Memphis achieve and come
close to the state of Tennessee's mandate to reduce its wastestream
volume by 25%.  Benny Lendermon, the city's division director of
Public Works, said that Memphis may miss the end-of-the-year
deadline, but the city is well ahead of most areas in Tennessee.

According to the state's Solid Waste Act of 1992, Tennessee
communities are required to show that they have reduced their waste
stream by 25% by the end of the year.  If a community hasn't met
this mandate, it must explain why and what it plans to do to
achieve this waste reduction.  The measure is up for re-
authorization before the Tennessee General Assembly during the
coming session.  It appears most communities will have failed to
meet this requirement, so state lawmakers may discuss extending the
25% reduction mandate.

A contract has been signed between the city of Memphis and FCR Inc.
(1373 E. Moorehead St., Charlotte, NC 28204; Tel: 704/347-0312) to
build a nearly $3 million recycling center on a city-donated six-
acre piece of property.  FCR already operates nine recycling
centers along the Eastern Seaboard and other communities in the
South.  As part of the 10-year contract with the city, Memphis will
receive $50 per ton for the recyclable materials which public work
crews will deliver to the facility as part of its soon-to-be
citywide curbside recycling program.  FCR guarantees Memphis $1
million in revenue a year for the estimated 20,000 tons of material
expected to be generated annually.  The community will save about
$400,000 a year in tipping fees by not taking this waste to the
local landfill.

BioChem Offers
Online Monitor

BioChem Technology Inc. (100 Ross Rd., King of Prussia, PA; Tel:
610/768-9360) has a new biological technology for monitoring
wastewater treatment processes.  BioGuide technology is a real-time
online monitor of bacteria in activated sludge wastewater treatment
plants that allows more accurate control of the treatment process.

Samples are taken and analyzed in the bioreactor and results are
fed to a computer system that can control the pumps and valves of
the treatment process. Jaw Lee, president of BioChem, explains that
the company monitors the bacteria activity inside the process
instead of the conventional way of monitoring bacteria involvement.
The process was developed, Lee says, because BioChem believed that
the wastewater treatment process needs to be controlled just like
any other biochemistry process.

Device Will Sample
Waterborne Residues

Scientists from the Dept. of the Interior (DOI, National Biological
Service, Midwest Science Center, 4200 New Haven Rd., Columbia, MO
65201) and the Fish and Wildlife Service (Vicksburg Field Office,
Vicksburg, MI 39180) used semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) to
passively sample aqueous polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs)
and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in Bayou Meto, AR.  The
two sites were upstream and downstream from the confluence with a
tributary that delivers PCDDs and PCDFs to the Bayou.

Bayou Meto is a turbid, low-gradient stream that originates in the
highlands of central Arkansas and empties into the Arkansas River
290 km to the southeast.  Near Jacksonville, AR, about 40 km
downstream from Bayou Meto's source, a tributary joins Bayou Meto
from the North.  This tributary, Rocky Branch Creek, is a point
source of PCDDs and PCDFs, especially of 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 2,3,7,8-
tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) to Bayou Meto.

In 1971, the Vertac Co. began manufacturing phenoxy acid herbicides
at a plant in Jacksonville.  Based on extensive contamination with
PCDDs and PCDFs, the Vertac site is ranked 18th on the EPA's list
of 1301 Superfund sites.

Aquatic biota, including fish and amphibians, from Rocky Branch
Creek and Bayou Meto have been found to contain elevated
concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs.  Wood duck eggs collected from
Bayou Meto 9 km downstream from the confluence with Rocky Branch
Creek contained concentrations of TCDD as high as 510 pg/g on a wet
weight basis.  TCDD exhibits endocrine- and reproduction-disrupting
effects in fish and wildlife.  Laboratory studies indicate that
extremely low concentrations of TCDD can impair reproduction in
these animals.

The semipermeable membrane device and its use as a sampler of
aqueous hydrophobic organic contaminants have been extensively
characterized.  The SPMDs used in the present work can be briefly
described as segments of layflat polyethylene tubing with thin
films of triolein sealed inside.  The devices function as passive,
in situ aquatic samplers that sequester dissolved hydrophobic
contaminants from water.

Following dialysis, cleanup, and fractionation, four replicate 17-g
SPMD samples from each site were analyzed by GC/MS, and four were
evaluated by H4IIE bioassay.  As reported in Environmental Science
& Technology [29, 2886-2892, 1995], traces of only PCDD and PhCDDs
were detected in samples from the upstream site. The TCDD
equivalents obtained by bioassay of replicate SPMD samples agreed
well with results obtained by GC/MS.  The quantities sequestered by
SPMDs at the downstream site were used to estimate the aqueous
concentrations for both compounds as 2 pg/L.
