<BR>
Many long-time banking relationships have been ended lately as bank
customers react negatively to increased service charges or service
changes as a result of changes in bank ownership.

<P>

If you've recently switched banks, please remember to notify Kemper if
you take advantage of any shareholder privileges that involve transfers
to or from your bank account. 

<P>

These are the specific instances when your Kemper mutual fund account
records need to be updated when you change banks:

<P>

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>If you've signed up for the wire redemption privilege, which enables
you to sell all or a portion of your shares and have the proceeds wired
from your fund account to your bank account.

<P>

<LI>If you automatically invest a certain amount each month from your
checking or savings account.	

<P>

<LI>If you've signed up for the EXPRESS-Transfer privilege, which enables
you to use electronic funds transfer to move money between your bank,
savings institution or credit union and a Kemper account.

<P>

<LI>If you've arranged to have your dividends automatically deposited into
your bank account.

<P>

<LI>If you systematically withdraw a certain amount from your Kemper
mutual fund account and have it deposited into your bank account.

</UL>
<BR>

Shareholder Services will be happy to send you the appropriate form that
you'll need to complete in order to supply us with your new bank account
information.
