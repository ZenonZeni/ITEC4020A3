The focus in Finnish fusion physics studies is in radio-frequency (rf) applications of tokamak, e.g.                     plasma heating, non-inductive current drive and plasma diagnostics. The investigations cover ion cyclotron,                     lower hybrid and electron cyclotron frequencies including advanced gyrotron studies.                   <P>  The theoretical and computational work is done in collaboration with other Euratom Associations, JET and                     NET/ITER Team. Present Monte Carlo particle following codes, the FokkerñPlanck codes, Vlasov codes and the                     particle-in-cell (PIC) codes are further developed and applied to ion cyclotron heating, transport of energetic                     particles, fast wave and lower hybrid current drive.                     <P>Main Research Topics in 1996                          <UL><LI>Radio-Frequency Heating and Current Drive in Tokamak Plasmas                          <LI>Energetic Particles, Transport, and Confinement                          <LI>Microwave Diagnostics                          <LI>Fusion Neutronics</UL><A HREF="http://www.vtt.fi/ene/eneydi/FR/">FFUSION</A><p><hr><P><H3>Australia</H3><P>The Australian Fusion Research Group (AFRG) is a consortium drawn from     <UL><LI>University of Canberra     <LI>Central Queensland University,     <LI>Flinders University of South Australia     <LI>University of New England     <LI>University of Sydney     <LI>Australian National University</UL><P>undertaking research into high-temperature plasma physics under the Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering (AINSE)umbrella.<P>The present work of the AFRG is centred on the H-1 National Facility heliac, a medium-sized, fusion-related, high-temperature plasma physicsapparatus commissioned in 1993. Its replacement cost of $50M is estimated from the contract price of the similar size heliac TJ-II at presentunder construction in Spain.<hr><H3>JAPAN</H3><P>In Japan JAERI, the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, has emphasized the following: <P> (1) completion of the construction of the HighTemperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR), which aims at the utilization of high temperaturethermal energy (nearly 1000) produced by nuclear energy, with the first criticality in 1997, <P> (2) theresearch and development of a nuclear fusion reactor, which is expected to be an inexhaustibleenergy source, and the participation in the Engineering Design Activities for the InternationalThermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Project, <P> (3) the promotion of neutron science research,which is expected to make breakthroughs in basic science, applied science and nuclear energy, andcharged particle research (mainly ion irradiation research) and the promotion for the most advancedbasic research in the nuclear field by reserchers from both Japan and abroad, <P> (4) the construction ofthe large synchrotron radiation (SR) facility (SPring-8) to be completed in 1997, in cooperation withthe Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), to promote research through theutilization of ultrahigh brilliance Synchrotron radiation. <hr><H3>Germany</H3><P>The fusion research being conducted at Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik (IPP) in Garching is aimed at reproducing on earth the energyproduction process occurring on the sun.<P>The research activities of IPP are concerned with investigating the plasma physics principles underlying a fusion reactor: confinement ofhigh-temperature hydrogen plasmas in magnetic fields, heating and refuelling of plasmas, plasma diagnostics, magnetic field technology,electrical and electronic engineering, data acquisition and processing, systems studies, plasma theory and plasma-wall interaction.<P>For thispurpose IPP is conducting two large-scale experiments at Garching, the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak and the WENDELSTEIN 7-AS stellarator. Asuccessor to the present stellarator experiment, WENDELSTEIN 7-X, which is intended to demonstrate the reactor relevance of the stellaratorconcept developed at IPP, is under preparation.<P><hr><H3>Sweden</H3><P>The aim of the Swedish Research Unit (RU) is to take part in the EURATOM fusion research programme for the development of thermonuclearfusion based on magnetic confinement for power production. The activities of the Swedish RU are organised into a General Programme and aTechnology Programme. The work is distributed among several Universities: the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Chalmers University ofTechnology (CTH), Uppsala University (UU) and Lund University (LU) as well as at the Studsvik AB Research Centre.<P>A major part of the research in Sweden is carried out by groups at Universities. The General Programme of the Swedish Association includes both experimental and theoretical work involving both the reversed-field pinch(RFP) and tokamak configurations.<P>The programme for the Division of Fusion Plasma Physics at the Alfvén Laboratory primarily is concentrated to the following areas:<P>EXTRAP T2, based at KTH, has preferential support (45%) in the European programme. The device is primarily operated in the RFPconfiguration which is an approach to fusion where the main advantage is the potential for producing fusion plasmas with lower magnetic fieldrequirements.<P>In addition there is special emphasis in the experimental programme in the areas of plasma surface interaction and spectroscopy, by groups atKTH and LU.There is a Fusion Theory group at the Division which concentrates on the tokamak concept.<hr><H3>The UK contribution</H3>     <P>The UK contributes to fusion research in two ways: through the UK's own programme and     through our contribution to the Joint European Torus (JET) project which is Euratom's     flagship experiment. JET is situated at Culham next to our own laboratory.     <P>Key features of the UK fusion research programme are:     <P>COMPASS-D, a medium-sized tokamak which is highly adaptable and specifically designed to     address the problems of magnetic confinement, having the same magnetic geometry as JET     and the Next Step device, ITER.     <P>START - Small Tight-Aspect Ratio Tokamak - operational at Culham since early 1991. This 'baby' tokamak was the first high     temperature spherical tokamak in the world and remains the leading experiment of its kind.     <P>MAST - Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak - START's bigger brother (approximately twice as big), now under construction at     Culham.     <P>The Joint European Torus (JET) - The UK programme contributes to JET by providing many of the staff (about half) and by     agreements to undertake specific projects.<BR> <P>Much of the early work on fusion in UK was undertaken by universities, before being centered at Harwell and Aldermaston. The original large-scale experimental fusion device on which British physicists     worked during the 1940s and 50s was housed in a hangar at Harwell. The device called ZETA - Zero     Energy Toroidal Assembly was at first, shrouded in secrecy but with the temporary thaw in the Cold     War created in the late 1950s by the visit of Kruschev and Bulganin.<P><hr><H3>USA</H3><P>U.S. fusion program is highly integrated and conducted by several nationallaboratories, universities, and industrial organizations, across nearly 100 sites. The U.S. fusion program itself is becoming integrated into an international effort with theInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) activity as the focus.<h4><LI>United States - Universities</h4>        <UL>        <LI><A HREF="http://www.physics.auburn.edu/fusion.html">Auburn                University</A> - Plasma Physics        <LI><a href = "http://www.ap.columbia.edu/ap.html">Columbia                University - Applied Physics</a>        <LI><a href = "http://www.cs.hamptonu.edu/science/fusion/cfrt/html">Hampton                University Center for Fusion Research and Training</a>        <LI><a href = "http://physics.physics.lehigh.edu:1525/">Lehigh University                Physics Department</a>        <LI><a href="http://lost.pfc.mit.edu/">MIT Plasma Fusion Center</a> (at                the Massachusetts Institute of Technology)        <LI><a href="http://www.pppl.gov/">Princeton University Plasma Physics                Laboratory</a> (PPPL)        <LI><a href =                "http://w3.pppl.gov/~rfheeter/gradweb/gradhome.html">Princeton                University Graduate Program in Plasma Physics</a>        <LI><A HREF ="http://hibp.ecse.rpi.edu/">Plasma Dynamics Laboratory</A>                (at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY)        <LI><A HREF ="http://neutrino.nuc.berkeley.edu/fusion/fusion.html">Nuclear                Fusion</a> (Dept. of Nuclear Engineering) and the                <A HREF ="http://ptsg.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Plasma Theory and Simulation                Group</A> (Dept. of Electrical Engineering) at the University of California,                Berkeley.        <LI><a href =                "http://www.llnl.gov/das/das_research/plasma.html">University                of California, Davis</a> (UCD) - Fusion        <LI><a href = "http://www.ps.uci.edu/physics/plasma.html">University of                California, Irvine</a> - Plasma Physics, within the                <a href = "http://www.ps.uci.edu/physics/">Physics and Astronomy</a>                department.        <LI><a href = "http://bohm.physics.ucla.edu/">University of                California at Los Angeles</a> (UCLA) - Plasma Physics        <LI><a href="http://www-ferp.ucsd.edu/">University of California,                San Diego </a> (UCSD) - Fusion        <LI><a href = "http://ne43.ne.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois,                Urbana-Champaign</a> (UIUC) - Nuclear Engineering        <LI><a href = "http://www.lle.rochester.edu">University of Rochester,                Laboratory for Laser Energetics</a>        <LI><a href="http://w3fusion.ph.utexas.edu">University of Texas</a>        <LI><a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/fusion.htm">University                of Wisconsin - Madison</a> - Fusion Programs        <LI><a href = "http://physics.wm.edu/Grad_Brochure/Plasma.html">William                & Mary</a> - Plasma Physics        </UL>        <P>  <h4><LI>United States - National and Private Laboratories</h4>        <UL>        <LI><A HREF="http://www.td.anl.gov/programs.html">Argonne                National Laboratory</A> - Technology Development Programs.
