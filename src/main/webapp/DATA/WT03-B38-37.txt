TURKISH BOT PROJECTS EMERGE DESPITE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES

Financing for Turkey's first two build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes
has been tied up after a decade of delay.

But project and trade financiers are keeping Turkey under tight
scrutiny following the inconclusive general election on 24 December, in
which the pro-Islamic Welfare Party topped the polling with just 21 per
cent of the vote.

Bankers say that signs of a turnaround in the economy was a key
determinant in finally closing the long-awaited limited recourse deals,
which have lingered on the drawing board since the mid-1980s, when they
figured among the first ever blueprints for BOT-style infrastructure
projects.  Other countries have since left Turkey far behind.

ECAs take on risk

Export credit agencies (ECAs) and commercial banks have taken on
substantial risk for the $1.4bn hydroelectric power and dam project at
Birecik on the Euphrates River and the $865m water supply and treatment
plant at Izmit, some 80 miles east of Istanbul.

A new readiness among commercial lenders to take on Turkish risk was
borne out by the oversubscription of unsecured commercial loans, priced
at 225 basis points (bp).

A dozen more BOT projects are awaiting approval, mostly in the power
sector, where the government has forecast growth in demand for
electricity of almost 250 per cent over the next 15 years.  Prior to
her resignation, prime minister Tansu Ciller said that BOT projects
worth $16bn were needed in Turkey over the next decade.

These include the 1,200 MW Ilisu Dam on the Tigris River, expected to
cost some $2.5bn, for which tenders are expected soon.

``It should certainly be quicker to do deals in future as there is now
a reference point for the Turkish market'', says Mr Howard Lack, the
director at London-based Chase Investment Bank, the arranger for
syndicated lending at both Birecik and Izmit.

``Before Birecik, the Treasury had no previous experience of a complex
structure that involved some 40 documents, but they will understand the
issues and the risks that are being asked in the future'', Mr Lack
says.

Banks' analysis

Analysts are examining the conflicting signals coming from Turkey to
weigh the extent of their participation in future operations.

``We are mindful of the election result, and like most banks, are
adopting a wait-and-see approach'', Mr Alan Paton, head of trade and
export finance of Societe Generale's London branch tells ITF.

``These are early days -- it is far from clear how things will go'', Mr
Paton adds.  SocGen took a strong hand in syndicated lending finalised
late in 1995 for Birecik and Izmit.

Adding complexity to western views of an increasingly important market
where the political situation may lay unresolved until February was
Turkey's entry into the EU customs union on 1 January 1996.

``The EC vote was a positive factor, but we are continuing to monitor
the progress of the Turkish economy following the elections'',
Mr Dennis Kennedy, NCM Credit Insurance's underwriter for the Middle
East, North Africa and Turkey tells ITF.

A series of recent economic and financial crises that came to a head in
1994 has drawn comparisons with Mexico from some quarters.

NCM said that Turkey represented ``a market with enduring economic
problems'' in a country summary issued in September.

The ratings agency, Standard & Poors, revised down its country outlook
from ``positive'' to ``stable'' in October.

Recent estimates suggest the budget deficit for the first quarter of
1996 will be greater than for the whole of 1995.

The market fell under close scrutiny in 1994, when massive capital
flight led to plummeting sovereign debt ratings, an inflation level of
126 per cent and currency devaluation of over 50 per cent.

Reserves up

However, the economy began to grow in the first quarter of 1995 and
foreign reserves had risen to $16.3bn by September, compared to $3bn in
April 1994.  Inflation is also seen as less of a danger.

As the macroeconomic situation improves, Turkish borrowers are
returning to the international market to borrow on longer maturities
and narrower margins, which are creeping back to pre-1994 crisis
levels.

Turkiye Garanti Bankasi secured a benchmark two-year $150m facility in
October at 65bp over Libor, marking the first loan over one year for a
Turkish bank in 1995.

ECA support

ECAs took 64 per cent of the risk in the ground-breaking 672MW Birecik
scheme, providing 151/2-year cover that includes a 51/2-year construction
period.

Germany's Hermes insured DM585m (#256m) to support the principal
developer, Philipp Holzmann.

Also involved were Belgian, Austrian and French ECAs, which guaranteed
around DM803m in bank loans to the sponsor Birecik Company, which
provided DM327m in equity towards the 15-year concession.

Eight-year commercial lending worth DM462m made up the senior debt
package.

Co-arrangers were Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, Bayerische
Landesbank, Girokredit, Generale Bank and Societe Generale.

Forty-four banks participated in the two tranches, which were
oversubscribed by 30 per cent.  Margins were 100bp over Libor for the
ECA loan and 225bp for the commercial deal.

Given that aspects of the legal situation attaching to BOT schemes in
Turkey remain unresolved -- all concession-type contracts fall under the
jurisdiction of an administrative court -- lenders have extracted
government guarantees insuring them against force majeure or default by
Birecik Company.

The Birecik Company has protected itself against default on tariff
payments by the offtaker, the state-owned Turkiye Elektrik Uretim
Iletim (TEAS), by obtaining government guarantees.

``Future deals will need less support, with more risk being borne by
the commercial parties and banks'', says Mr Lack.

Water project

The UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has taken the
leading ECA role in Turkey's second BOT scheme: a 15-year concession to
improve the supply of drinking and industrial water to the Turkish city
of Izmit.

ECGD is providing a 100 per cent guarantee for $236m in commercial
lending, which secured about $803m in bank debt.

France's Coface has extended insurance for a $180m tranche, with
Japan's EID/MITI supporting a further $40m in loans over seven years.

The combination reflects ECGD's growing collaboration with its French
and Japanese counterparts (ITF 252/11).

Untied lending worth $180m has been agreed by the Export-Import Bank of
Japan (Jexim).

Banks have provided $167m on an unsecured basis, split into a $116m
seven-year facility and a $51m five-year standby facility.  These were
oversubscribed by 15 per cent.

Co-arrangers were National Westminster Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bank
and  SocGen -- the latter lending over $83m.

Repayments to the project company, Izmit Su, are to be made in dollars.

Project security resides in offtake agreements and guarantees provided
by the Municipality of Izmit backed by the Turkish Treasury.

The sponsor -- which has injected some $139m in equity and comprises the
local companies Guris and Gama and the Municipality of Izmit, alongside
the UK's Thames Water and Japan's Mitsui & Co and Sumitomo Corporation
-- will commence its operating period in December 1998.

Breathing space

Most ECAs have taken a watching brief in the immediate post-election
period.
ECGD had planned a cover review in 1995, but this was postponed because
of the December polling.

The UK agency has ``one or two reasonable-sized deals in the
pipeline'', according to a spokesman, ``but, as always, these may take
awhile to come to fruition.  Following Izmit, almost all the cover
available in the market has been committed''.

``The two deals both went well, but took quite a lot of the available
appetite out of the marketplace'', SocGen's Mr Paton observes.  ``There
would be an appetite for the right project, but ECAs form a very
important leverage aspect for commercial banks''.

Private markets

Turkey remains a popular market for forfaiters.

The London-based Standard Bank will look at 360-day paper, principally
for commodity-based short-term deals.  Standard is doing business up to
three years for capital goods transactions.

``Margins have moved slightly upwards due to the uncertainty after the
election, but have otherwise been quite stable since the market
recovered in 1995'', says a spokesman.

Standard will look at paper from a range of banks, including two of the
public sector institutions, TC Ziraat Bankasi and Turkiye Halk Bankasi.

Bankers and insurers are generally agreed that Turkey's private sector
banks may offer more scope for trade finance.

NCM highlighted the local private sector as a much better risk for
exporters in its September report, pointing out that the majority of
foreign exchange reserves are held privately.

``Public sector companies, currently comprising about half the legal
economy, are in the main loss-making and debt-ridden'', said the
report.

NCM's trading terms extend to a maximum 180 days, with open account
business acceptable where buyers, mainly private, can show a good
recent track record or a visible hard currency trading surplus.

Analysts have noted that this is more commonplace as economic
liberalisation has freed companies from political interference.

Most businesses require the security of a letter of credit or bank-
endorsed bills of exchange.

RUSSIAN GOLD FINANCING SET TO TRIGGER MORE PROJECTS?

The completion and disbursement of a ground-breaking $100m gold mine
financing has triggered hopes among western financiers that more
Russian projects will move ahead as the government gradually eases the
regulatory environment.

The move complements activity by western financiers in Russia's
hydrocarbons sector, where protracted manoeuverings have eventually led
to the provision of US export credit guarantees for projects under the
oil and gas framework agreement (OGFA) (ITF 247/6).

The arranger of the limited recourse gold deal, Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell (DMG), took two years to structure and negotiate the
transaction with the Russian authorities and the lenders.

The deal ``sets a precedent for international debt financing for such
projects in Russia'', says a DMG director closely involved with the
project, Mr Andrew Seton.

Funds for the project in the far eastern Magadan region were released
in mid-December, following the signature of loan agreements in June
between the Omolon Gold Mining Company and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the US' Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (Opic) (ITF 240/3).

Opic contributed guarantees worth $52.5m and will also extend $60m in
investment insurance.

Omolon, a joint venture between the Denver-based Cyprus Amax Minerals
Company and Russian (mainly mining) concerns, is the first joint
venture to receive a licence to mine gold in Russia.

The company will use the loan proceeds to develop the Kubaka lode gold
deposit, located some 200 miles off the Arctic Circle.

Repayments from the sale of the mine's output will be channelled
through a licensed offshore account.

Security for the lenders is based on a series of long-term contracts
that have replaced Russian government payment risk with contractual
risk.

In return for mixed hard currency and rouble payments, the Russian
government will be allocated first claim on the mine's output,
anticipated at an annual 300,000 ounces of gold and 200,000 ounces of
silver.

If payments do not ensue, the Russian Foreign Trade Bank, in its role
as agent for the government and the joint venture, will export the
metals to western buyers.

``People were not prepared to lend or invest on the basis where the
government held a monopoly over gold production and exports'', another
banker specialising in CIS minerals tells ITF.  ``Lenders are happy
with this deal -- and the structure is likely to be replicated for other
gold projects''.

DMG's activities in Russia and the former Soviet Union have raised
nearly $4bn in project finance to date.

Further EBRD activity in Russia includes support for short-term trade
finance under its Trade Facilitation Programme (ITF 248/2).

INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES FUND PAKISTAN IPP

A new independent power project (IPP) is going ahead in Pakistan's
Punjab state backed by the Export-Import Bank of Japan (Jexim) and the
World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC).

As its contribution to 12-year Japanese buyer credits worth Y18.2bn
(#115m) for the 365MW Lal Pir II scheme in Muzzafargagh, Jexim is to
provide Y10.9bn as a direct loan on its own account.  Around Y4bn of
this is dollar-denominated.

The remaining Y7.3bn is being co-financed with a syndicate of 15
commercial banks, nine of which are from Japan.  Arranging the
facility, which is priced at 240 basis points (bp) over Libor, is the
scheme's financial advisor, Bank of Tokyo, with Sanwa Bank, Deutsche
Bank, Dresdner Bank and ING Bank.

The political risk in this tranche will be insured by EID/MITI.

The deal was reportedly well over-subscribed, principally reflecting an
appetite from banks that missed Lal Pir I (ITF 234/3).

The proceeds will be deployed by the sponsor, AES Pak Gen Company
(AESPG), to finance the purchase of equipment from Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, to be supplied through the trading house Nichimen
Corporation.

Jexim's security in the project pivots on the government of Pakistan's
guarantees for currency conversion and transfers; the purchase of
generated electricity over 30 years by the Pakistan Water & Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) and the supply of fuel by Pakistan State
Oil Company.

IFC role

The IFC has agreed an A-loan/B-loan structure worth $70m for the $349m
oil-fired scheme, which is to be implemented on a build-own-operate
(BOO) basis.

A $20m A-loan has been extended over 15 years.

The $50m B-facility has a 12-year tenor and a margin of 275bp.  IFC has
also taken a portion of the $95m equity injected by AESPG, which was
created by the US' AES Corporation in June 1995.

The participation of the World Bank's investment arm follows an A-
loan/B-loan facility agreed for a $138m project in Karachi last July
(ITF 242/5).

Jexim and the IFC have worked together in Pakistan's power sector on
Lal Pir I and the country's first limited recourse power financing, the
ground-breaking Hub River scheme (ITF 222/1).

The Lal Pir II project will help to alleviate power shortages in
Pakistan estimated at around 2000MW.  Completion is expected near the
end of 1997.

EXPORT CREDIT INCLUDED IN UKRANIAN PAYMENTS SUPPORT PACKAGE

The Export-Import Bank of Japan has included a Y6bn (#37m) export
financing facility in its new Y24bn economic stabilisation support
package for Ukraine.

The package, signed in late-December, is part of the international
effort to underpin the former Soviet republic where the president,
Mr Leonid Kuchma, remains confronted with daunting problems putting his
reform programme into effect.

``By helping to stabilise the economy, the loan is intended to uphold
the government's intention to dismantle its nuclear weaponry system'',
Jexim said in a statement.  The question of the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant is also high on governments' agendas.

Jexim observed that the G7 and EU nations had agreed in mid-1994 to
provide $4bn or more ``over the next two years'' and remained ``united
in their recognition that the Ukraine's economic stability is important
to world peace, in view of its nuclear capabilities''.

The Y18bn untied loan element of the package -- intended as co-financing
with the World Bank -- is part of the $200m in balance of payments
support, drawn from Jexim's funds for the development initiative,
committed last March by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Japanese prime
minister.

Other governments to commit export credits include the US, Germany,
Italy, Canada and France.

The IMF has approved an SDR1.5bn standby package; the World Bank has
already committed loans worth around $720m; and the EU an Ecu225m loan
for balance of payments support.

During a visit to Kiev last summer, Mr James Wolfensohn, the World Bank
president, said the bank could provide over $1bn in the next three
years.

But these loans could be in jeopardy if a rebellious parliament has its
way over issues such as privatisation and farm reform -- and Mr Kuchma's
reform programme is blocked.

UKRAINE SECURES FINANCE FOR AGRICULTURE

Kiev has secured the first financing from the EBRD/NCM co-operation
agreement on projects in eastern Europe.

The Dutch insurer and the European Bank for Reconstruction &
Development are backing a $20.7m agricultural project in the Myronavka
region, which includes Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.

NCM's participation involves insuring Dutch exports of machinery and
farm vehicles.

ECAS MOBILISE SUPPORT FOR EGYPTIAN/ISRAELI OIL REFINERY

Export credit agencies (ECAs) are preparing to mobilise cover for an
Egyptian/Israeli joint venture scheme, the Middle East Oil Refinery
(MIDOR).

Sponsors have yet to choose between Banque National de Paris (BNP) and
National Westminster Bank to head supplier credit arrangements, but a
financial close is expected by construction start, at the end of
March 1996.

Export credit cover from Israel worth between $100-$150m has been
secured.

Further ECA-backed loans for the scheme will total an anticipated
$600m.  The eventual choice of agencies will depend on the sources of
construction equipment, but agencies from France, Germany, Japan,
Belgium and the UK have expressed interest.

A construction contract has been signed with a European consortium
comprising Italy's Technipetrol and France's Technip, following a hard
fought tender.

Spain's Tecnicas Reunidas has been awarded a large subcontracting deal,
which involves the provision of supplier credit guarantees worth $100m
by Compania Espanola de Seguros de Credito a la Exportacion (CESCE).

Regional banks, including the National Bank of Egypt, Misr Bank and
Israeli General Bank are to provide working capital worth about $370m.

The European Investment Bank has also committed around $300m.

Some $240-$250m of equity is to be injected into the project.  A stake
may be offered to the winner of an imminent contract for management and
operations.

MIDOR's shareholding comprises two 40 per cent stakeholders -- the
Merhav group, owned by Israeli businessman Mr Yosef Malman, and
Egyptian entrepreneur Mr Hussein Salem -- and Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation (EGPC).

EGPC will supply crude oil and has undertaken to purchase 20 per cent
of MIDOR's production.

The refinery will be built at Alexandria near the Suez-Mediterranean
pipeline terminal, at a site designated as a 40-year renewable free
trade zone by the Egyptian government.

Project processing capacity is slated at 100,000 barrels a day, with a
refined offtake of around five million tonnes annually to be targeted
at markets in Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Palestine and several other
eastern Mediterranean economies.

MIDOR is examining transportation options and the possibilities for
constructing two new regional terminals to receive the refined produce.

WORLD BANK OFFERS POWER PROJECT GUARANTEES

The World Bank has offered to use its revamped guarantee programme to
assist Egypt's plans to build its first three concessionary power
projects.

The bank's partial risk guarantee would offer shelter for commercial
banks in the event of any difficulties relating to contracts, including
fuel supply commitments and payments by the Egyptian Electricity
Authority (EEA).

The EEA is examining bids from six consultants to prepare tender
documents for the build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes, which comprise
a 100MW wind farm at Zaafarana, a 240MW scheme at Ataqa and a 660MW
thermal plant.

BIS TRACKS RISE IN SHORT-TERM TRADE FINANCE FOR EMERGING MARKETS

The growth of short-term trade finance to developing countries is a key
factor fuelling increased commercial bank lending to these markets, the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) says.

Based on January-June 1995 data, the Basle-based BIS reports
significant growth in total lending from the developed world.  This
rose to $25.6bn, up from $19.9bn in the first half of 1994.

Particular note was made of banks' claims up to 360 days, which rose as
a percentage of total claims.  A growing volume of trade finance and
banks' reluctance to expose themselves longer term were among reasons
for this.

The favoured target region for commercial lenders was Asia, where
lending jumped by $33.7bn, compared to $15.6bn in 1994.

The report noted a ``greater selectivity'' in lending to Latin America,
which fell by $4.2bn, although it seemed ``too early to say'' whether
the Mexican crisis had impacted on this trend.

A greater global dependence on short-term capital flows has led
commercial banks to assess their portfolios on a more frequent basis.

GRIFFIN LAUNCHES EXPORT INVOICE DISCOUNTING SERVICE

Griffin Factors has opted to follow its main competitors and launch an
export invoice discounting service to cater for larger export
companies.

Exporters with their solid in-house credit control unit will now be
offered finance, without the obligation to accept a traditional ``full
factoring'' arrangement.

An offshoot of Midland Bank, Griffin was one of the first factors to
offer domestic clients an invoice discounting service (under which
finance is provided against invoices without direct involvement by the
finance house in the process of collection, unless a payment falls
seriously overdue).

But it stood back from the industry-wide move into invoice discounting
of exports, continuing to trust to traditional full factoring -- under
which it retains responsibility for collecting all payments.

And this approach seemed to be justified, because in most recent years,
it managed to remain in second place in the league table of
international business handled by the UK's factors -- last year the
volume of exports it factored was up by 25 per cent at more than #90m.

Griffin management was also concerned about the practical difficulties
of getting involved in collection of overdue invoice-discounted
payments.  A particular worry was a German law that allowed buyers to
refuse to allow their debts to be assigned.

Market pressures

But market pressures on Griffin to follow competitors, such as
International Factors, into the invoice discounting of exports
increased.  There was strong demand for the service from clients and
industry figures showed that the spectacular growth in invoice
discounting was far outstripping the more measured expansion of
traditional factoring.

There was, particularly, an increased number of larger exporters -- who
were not prepared to involve a factor in their routine payment
collection -- seeking trade-based finance.

Last year, Griffin dipped a toe quietly into the water.  It also
equipped itself to cope with a change, recruiting specialist language
staff who could chase up foreign payments.

And, with fortunate timing, the law in Germany was clarified to allow
foreign export suppliers to promise repayment to their financiers.

There was clearly a risk that Griffin could lose clients who wanted
discounted finance, if it continued to stand aside from this trend.
 But it still remains committed to further development of the
traditional factoring operation.  Recently, it set up an EDI service
that will allow clients to send in invoices electronically, without the
need for paper back-up.  Restricted for now to domestic business, this
will eventually be available to exporters.

WOLFENSOHN RINGS ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES AT WORLD BANK

Mr James Wolfensohn, World Bank president, has restructured top
management posts at the bank in a drive to improve efficiency and to
build incentives and accountability into the organisation's culture.

In the first significant management initiative at the bank since he
assumed control last June, Mr Wolfensohn has increased his team of
managing directors from three to five and created a new Executive
Committee.

The changes became operational on 1 January 1996.

In a memo circulated among more than 6,000 World Bank personnel in
December, the president explained the initiative as part of his
overriding aim ``to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the Bank's
work and its objectives'' by providing ``a framework for liberating the
energies and skills of the rest of the organisation''.

The managing directors, who will become directly involved in specific
day-to-day management tasks, have been allocated the following roles:

* Mr Gautam Kaji will be joined by Mr Caio Koch-Weser, former vice-
president for the Middle East and Africa, for a joint controlling role
in charge of the bank's operations, policies and programmes.

Moving into the Middle East and Africa seat is Mr Kemal Dervis, who has
worked before on the Middle East.

Mr Koch-Weser, a Brazilian, was a very familiar face across the region,
including at various stages of the Middle East peace process.

Mr Spiros Voyadzis, another Middle East expert, has been named the
World Bank's special representative to the EU and manager of the bank's
new Brussels office.

* Mr Sven Sandstrom assumes charge of Human and Information Resources
and Management, in addition to Corporate Planning and Budgeting.

Mr Wolfensohn has identified personnel and training as the bank's
greatest problem areas.  According to the memo, Mr Sandstrom has been
given a two-year brief to turn around the bank's traditional ``armlock
of bureaucracy'' -- where task managers are reportedly separated from
upper levels by five management layers -- and to create a ``results
culture''.

* Ms Jessica Einhorn has been promoted to manage activities in finance
and resource mobilisation, supervising vice presidency functions
previously covered by the treasurer, the Controller, Financial Policy
and Risk Management and Cofinancing and Financial Advisory Services.

She will also assume the chairmanship of the bank's Finance Committee.

* Mr Richard Frank is to chair the Private Sector Development Group,
with responsibility for working with senior managers of the Bank Group
and to evolve the bank's overall private sector strategy, which is
making greater use of commercial markets through instruments, such as
its revamped guarantees (ITF 248/10).

Mr Frank has previously been responsible for working on the Bank's
future policy direction.

The moves will ``provide clear lines of authority for the main areas of
our business and to strengthen the Group's ability to address major
strategic issues'', said Mr Wolfensohn.

Committee launch

The five managing directors will form part of a new 10-strong Executive
Committee, which is to hold meetings on a weekly basis.

The Committee includes Mr Mark Malloch Brown, promoted from director to
vice-president of External Relations, and chief economist Mr Michael
Bruno, also elevated to vice presidential status.

Mr Malloch Brown has long links with non-governmental organisations and
the media.  His arrival in 1994 gave the bank a fresh approach to
public relations.

Mr Bruno is a widely respected former governor of the Central Bank of
Israel.

Where matters are related to the larger World Bank Group, the committee
will be enlarged to accommodate the executive vice president of the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), Mr Jannik Lindbaek, and the
executive vice president of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
agency (MIGA), Mr Akira Iida.

This fits a pattern profiled at the October 1995 World Bank/IMF annual
meeting in Washington, where exploratory strategies were announced for
greater co-ordination within the Group.

Further changes in 1996 will involve the uptake by 50 top executives of
management courses and the secondment of executive staff into industry
and private sector banks.

Mr Johannes Linn, whose experience at the bank includes several senior
economics posts, became the World Bank's vice-president for Europe and
Central Asia on 1 January, following the retirement of Mr Wilfred
Thalwitz.

Mr Timothy Thahane, the World Bank vice-president who narrowly missed
out becoming president of the African Development Bank, occupies a new
vice-presidency for United Nations affairs.  This office is intended to
better co-ordinate the World Bank's relations with the UN system.

He is replaced as vice-president and World Bank group secretary by Mr
Shengman Zhang, executive director for China since November 1994.

Mr Wolfensohn stressed in the memo that the goal of the bank continues
to be the promotion of sustainable development ``in the broadest
sense'', in particular the alleviation of poverty and assisting
countries in transition.  ``I have made it clear that I expect the
management to work with me at top pressure'', he concluded.

WORLD BANK AGREES NEW LENDING FOR EASTERN EUROPE

The World Bank has agreed new lending for eastern Europe, including a
$160m loan to boost Poland's power sector.  The recipient, the Polish
Power Grid Company (PPGC), will use the proceeds towards the bulk of
foreign exchange requirements needed to reinforce the country's high
voltage grid.

Other recent approvals include a $24m facility to bring Russia's
product and process standards up to World Trade Organisation levels; a
$27.3m loan for investments in Latvia's municipal services; and an
SDR4.1m International Development Association credit to enhance reforms
in Albania's agro-processing sector.

KLEINWORT TO EXPAND CROSS-BORDER REACH WITH LEASING UNIT ACQUISITION

Kleinwort Benson has moved to extend its cross-border reach through the
purchase of the leasing finance and advisory arm of SBC Warburg for an
undisclosed fee.

The acquisition of S G Warburg & Co (Leasing) comprises Warburg's
leasing portfolio and a ten-strong executive team, led by Mr Michael
Hardwick.

The Warburg team has acted as adviser and arranger to several big
ticket projects, including aircraft transactions involving Boeing,
Cathay Pacific and Air France; and the acquisition of Eurostar trains
for the Channel Tunnel.

Ongoing activities include negotiations with Malaysian Airlines.

``The international side of the business is mainly OECD-based, but is
developing fast in several Asia-Pacific countries'', Mr Hardwick tells
ITF.

Mr Hardwick says that his team's cross-border lease financing
activities have focused strongly on France, Germany, Finland, Denmark
and Japan.

The move adds some $500m to Kleinwort's existing leasing assets.

COFACE LAUNCHES NEW CROSS-BORDER FACILITY

Groupe Coface has initiated an innovative trade credit insurance scheme
in the UK -- and expects to extend the concept across, and possibly
beyond, Europe in response to the growing cross-border requirements of
multinational companies.

The French-based international credit insurer launched the pilot for a
new range of products entitled Globalalliance on 3 January through its
London-based Coface LBF arm.

Coface's pilot Euro Trader policy permits UK-based firms with
subsidiaries in EU countries to provide both domestic and international
cover for their group operations under one, singly worded policy chosen
from Coface LBF's Open Trader or Top Trader range.

``Euro Trader has been made possible by the highly integrated
information technology resources of Coface's Credit Alliance network'',
says Ms Bridget Taxy, head of Coface LBF.

``It enables a finance director, through a single negotiation, and with
a single point of contact, to arrange and manage closely-tailored
international cover backed up by practical local support throughout
Europe''.

Euro Trader makes use of the EU's ``Freedom of Services'' legislation,
which allows for cross-border insurance throughout the Union.  ``We
hope to go outside EU legislation eventually'', Ms Taxy tells ITF.

Innovative reach

Euro Trader's most striking innovation is its facility for operational
documentation in the currency, and often the language, of the local
subsidiary.

The parent company may also select varying degrees of centralisation or
decentralisation.  Choice is offered between a group wide strategy or
terms and conditions that more closely reflect individual subsidiaries'
needs at three different levels:

* rates for premium and service;

* indemnification levels;

* the ``excess'' threshold below which losses are for the account of
the policy holder.

For UK-based multinationals wishing to develop a gradual group wide
credit insurance strategy, the scheme can be initiated through just one
or two subsidiaries and extended at a later date.

Euro Trader is the latest in a series of product developments from
credit insurers battling for UK market share (ITF 251/4).

It also marks a further stage in a trend increasingly discernible in
the single European market whereby intra-EU deals are helping to fuel
the expansion of short-term political risk cover capacity among
insurers (ITF 252/13).

EAST EUROPEAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING ON HOLD

The European Union assistance programme to the CIS countries is
currently on hold, following opposition led by Spain to the way the
contracts are awarded.

The TACIS programme, with funds of about Ecu500m, provides technical
assistance and know-how for economic and reform programmes proposed by
the governments of the 12 former Soviet countries and Mongolia.

Spain has blocked the programme for 1996 because it wants reform of the
way the contracts are tendered and different criteria used in their
allocation.  Privately, officials say Spain is opposed to the programme
because their companies only win about 2 per cent of the contracts.

Last March, officials proposed new guidelines for the TACIS programme
to start this year, which would permit TACIS funds to be invested in
small and medium-sized enterprises and in infrastructure projects.

These funds are intended to be strategic investments that would
catalyse much larger funds from the World Bank, European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and other institutional investors.
Similar investments have been made successfully in Central Europe.

New formula

This new formula, extending the traditional mandate of the TACIS
programme, has already been approved by Parliament, but was blocked in
the Council of Ministers.  Officials plan to put it before the Council
again, but say that an ``educated guess'' would anticipate it being
rejected again.

The most likely outcome, say officials, is that the Council will
eventually approve a continuation of the former programme, restricting
funds to technical assistance and know-how transfer for one more year.
The new programme is likely to be postponed until 1997.

Meanwhile, officials are continuing to work on the programmes approved
using the 1995 budget.  Assuming the Council finally approves the TACIS
funds before the summer, officials are confident that all the funds
could be committed before the end of 1996.

DG BANK SETS UP FORFAITING OPERATION IN LONDON

Deutschegenossenschafts (DG Bank), the central business and investment
unit for Germany's popular and co-operative banks, has set up a trade
finance unit to market trade paper to the London forfaiting community.

Acting as the provider of corporate and international services for
almost 3,000 local institutions, DG Bank should be well placed to feed
a stream of export deals to forfait traders and investors in the
secondary market.

The new operation is being headed by Janine Barber, recruited from
Standard Bank London's forfaiting team.

Ms Barber's specialist knowledge of eastern Europe will be particularly
useful for DG Bank:  many of the small and medium-sized German firms
that form the core client base of the Volksbanks (popular) and
Raiffeisen (co-operative) banks are selling to the former communist
countries that lie across Germany's eastern border.  Indeed, during its
first weeks, DG's London trade finance operation has handled deals for
exports to Russia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia.

The fact that DG felt the need to set up a forfaiting presence in
London -- to supplement the forfaiting service already offered by its
head office in Frankfurt and enhance its ability to take on risks that
it would not want to keep for its own portfolio -- bears witness to the
central role that the UK's capital continues to play in the market for
trade paper.

London hub

Although the biggest users of the technique are probably Italian rather
than UK exporters, London remains the hub of the secondary trading that
has gradually expanded forfaiters' ability to do business over recent
years.  Indeed, the range of country risks that can now be sold on the
market is probably wider than at any previous time.

Confidence seems to have ridden out the shock of Mexico's late 1994
financial crisis;  large volumes of Latin American risk are still
traded.

And there are even signs of a renewed willingness to support deals with
Bulgaria -- whose credibility was shattered several years ago by its
readiness to take on new loans when it was on the verge of default.

During 1995, specialists, such as Hungarian International Bank (HIB)
and London Forfaiting Company (LFC), began to do Bulgarian short-term
deals;  and in recent weeks LFC has actually quoted three year terms,
albeit for a transaction of only DM1m.

What remains to be seen is how the market will evolve following the
announcement that HIB is to close.  The bank has been one of the
leading forces in the market, with a strong reputation in pioneering
the acceptance of deals with the more difficult ex-communist countries,
such as Croatia, or the Baltic states.

HIB will have a successor institution:  the Hungarian national savings
bank OTP is to set up a trade finance company in London -- based in the
same premises and using many of the same staff.  Capitalised at about
#1m and hoping to chalk up #50m or so of deals in the first year, this
should be able to build on the legacy of east European expertise.

All the clearers continue to offer forfaiting services, but at Barclays
and Lloyds these are integrated into the main trade finance operations,
alongside conventional export credit:  the aim is to put forward the
most competitive technique for each particular deal, whether it be
forfaiting or supplier credit (or something else).  Forfaiting is often
combined with export credit, particularly as a means of dealing with
the 15 per cent uninsured ``front end'' component of Export Credits
Guarantee Department deals.

Midland Bank Aval forms an integral part of the HSBC group and was one
of the first to spot the potential for combining forfaiting and export
credit in the same operation -- but it does maintain a large team of
forfaiting specialists in London and the Far East and generates a big
flow of deals from its own exporting customers in the UK, Italy and
elsewhere.  It uses the technique to finance a lot of trade between Far
Eastern countries.

West Merchant Bank is another leading export credit house which offers
forfaiting as an alternative or complementary financing option.

CHINA SECURES ECGD SUPPORT FOR POWER FACILITY, AIRPORT CONTRACT

The UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has agreed a major
new power-related facility for China, the boom market which absorbed
the largest volume of ECGD guarantees for any single country in the
agency's 1994/95 financial year.

ECGD has also backed the commercial portion of a UK mixed credit
package for the new airport at Nanjing, and is gearing up to mobilise
additional cover for a $2bn-plus power complex in Shandong.

ECGD announced on 20 December that it will provide a 15-year repayment
guarantee for a #351.5m commercial loan in support of a contract won by
GEC-Alsthom to design and supply equipment for the Ling Ao power
station, better known as Daya Bay II, in Guangdong province.

GEC-Alsthom was a leading supplier for China's first nuclear power
station at Daya Bay (ITF 249/3).
  At Ling Ao it is responsible this time for the turnkey design, supply
and supervision of commissioning of two 900 MW turbine generator units
and plant, scheduled for completion by 2003.

The commercial lending syndicate is led by West Merchant Bank (WMB),
acting as arranger, principal lender and agent bank.

The borrower is State Development Bank of China (SDB), the specialised
infrastructure financing institution established in early 1994.  ECGD
says it envisages further borrowing by SDB for nuclear power
transactions.

Airport take-off

Concessional funds from the UK's Overseas Development Administration
and ECGD-backed commercial lending have enabled Siemens Plessey to win
a #22.4m contract to design and equip Nanjing's new international
airport, in Jiangsu province.

WMB and Standard Chartered Bank are providing 65 per cent of the Aid &
Trade Provision financing, in a tranche fully guaranteed by ECGD.

The balance will be met by an ODA grant from the #55m Third
Concessional Financing Arrangement signed in September 1994 between the
UK and China.

ECGD is expected to participate in a $2.2bn-$2.5bn power project at
Shandong, for which Industrial Bank of Japan Asia, NatWest Markets and
Societe Generale Asia have been appointed as lead arrangers for the ECA-
backed financing.

Also taking a role is the Export-Import Bank of the US (Eximbank).

Both agencies were considering whether to extend favourable interest
rates for the scheme as ITF went to press.  ECGD and Eximbank had set a
mid-January deadline for a preferential rate of 5.95 per cent already
rolled over previously.  All parties were understood to be anxious to
avoid the proposed new rate of 7 per cent.

The sponsor, China Power Company -- a joint venture involving a 49 per
cent foreign stake from China Light & Power and Electricite de France --
anticipates raising some $800m through international syndication to add
to equity that may total as much as $600m.

The project encompasses four plants.  The international funding will be
channelled to the 1,300 MW Liaocheng and 700 MW Heze complexes.
Equipment is to be supplied by the US' Westinghouse Electric
Corporation and the UK's Babcock Energy.

Remaining funding is likely to be tapped domestically.

ITF COMMENT:  Rapid growth in the huge Chinese market means the country
will remain the most active trade finance market in 1996, especially as
Beijing is expected to relax its credit squeeze, imposed since mid-
1993.

The economy remains mined with problems associated with everything from
a sometimes opaque legislative framework and a commitment to obtaining
rock-bottom pricing to political risk factors, which include the
succession to Mr Deng Xioping and the People's Liberation Army's recent
threatening gestures towards Taiwan.

But the macroeconomic numbers and market's potential still dazzle -- and
ECAs continue to take a positive view in the ``national interest'' to
give companies a chance in the market that everyone wants to crack.

China's foreign trade grew by 18 per cent in 1995 to $280bn, producing
a trade surplus of over $20bn.  This compared to $5.35bn in 1994,
according to preliminary statistics released by Beijing on 5 January.
Foreign exchange reserves were estimated at $70bn at end-1995.  Foreign
investment grew by 11 per cent last year, reaching $37bn.

The pattern of ECGD's business is replicated by other ECAs.  The UK
agency's concentration on the fiercely contested Chinese market was
reflected in its 1994/95 annual report, which showed exposure totalling
#1.54bn (ITF 251/7).

China accounted for over 40 per cent of ECGD's commitments to the so-
called Amber Zone of priority markets in 1994/95.

Exposure is building, but there is more support to come.  ECGD's chief
executive, Mr Brian Willott, has confirmed that further capacity is
available for UK exporters to China.

China will remain a buoyant market provided its political problems do
not get out of control.  But it will be a market whose pitfalls can
upset even the most careful investors for years to come.

One not so happy New Year message came from State Economic & Trade
Commission official Mr Xu Ming, who complained that domestic firms were
being pushed out of joint ventures when profits increase and local
partners cannot match the new investments in equity made by their
foreign partners.

This apparently widespread trend is giving foreign partners majority
holdings -- and, Chinese officials complain, monopolies in some domestic
industrial sectors.

``It is almost unanimous -- when returns become high, foreign parties
will scramble to nudge their Chinese partners out of holding status
with their overwhelming funding power'', Mr Xu said. Local firms should
``stand up against the aggression of foreign partners'', he said.

The language of international capitalism, which investors and creditors
so like to hear, will continue to suffer problems of translation in
China.

BANKS LINE UP CHINESE PROJECT FINANCINGS

International and locally-based banks are lining up a raft of new
Chinese projects.

Standard Chartered Capital Markets is lead arranger for the non-
recourse financing of a gas-fired power plant in Zhabei, Shanghai.

The sponsors, GE Capital Corporation and the Shanghai Municipal
Electric Power Company, are looking to raise around $120m over 10
years.

China International Capital Corporation is seeking to raise around
$750m for an oil project in the north-east.  CICC has been appointed by
Jilin Oil and Gas Development to tap overseas funds over the next five
years to lift annual production at the Jilin field to 2m tonnes.

Official sources have indicated that a project financing, including a
substantial equity stake from a foreign partner, would be looked upon
favourably.

CICC is the country's first joint venture investment bank, involving,
among others, the US' Morgan Stanley.

China is apparently turning towards public/private sector development
even of social infrastructure.

Hong Kong-based commercial lenders, including Hongkong & Shanghai
Banking Corporation, are participating in a $550m private placement to
finance large-scale government subsidised housing projects in Chinese
cities.

The initiative, which has targeted Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing and
Wuhan, marks an innovative tie-up between the private sector and
municipal housing authorities.

Korean venture seeks funds

The South Korean conglomerate Hyundai Group and a local partner plan to
borrow the bulk of the finance for a $450m joint venture petrochemicals
project in China's Shandong province.

A formal contract will be signed in the coming months for the venture
to start work.  Hyundai, which will take 70 per cent of the equity, and
its local partner, Jinan Honghua Group, have already registered capital
of $119m.

The remaining finance, to build a plant to produce 50,000 tonnes of
chemicals for use in the production of nylon, will come from borrowing.

The local partner is a subsidiary of Jinan Petrochemical Bureau, which
has applied to the Chinese State Planning Commission to have the plant
included as a priority project open for foreign borrowing.
