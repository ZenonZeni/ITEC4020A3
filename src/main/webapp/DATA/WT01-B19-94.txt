Harold E. Hughes
U.S. SENATE (RET.)   7222 WEST ST. JOHN ROAD   GLENDALE ARIZONA 85308

                               July 17, 1995


     Mr. Carl E. Olsen
     P.0. Box 4091
     Des Moines, Iowa 50333

     Dear Mr. Olsen:

     Thank you for your recent letter enclosing the most recent
     status report on legislative and judiciary action relating
     to the medical use of marijuana.

     I now spend most of my time outside the boundaries of Iowa,
     and actually live in Arizona. I'm simply not available for
     participation on a local basis. I do support the medical
     use of marijuana and sincerely hope some relief can be gained
     from federal restrictions. This probably will require action
     in the Congress rather than Iowa. I would suggest seeking
     advice, if you already haven't, from your Congressional offices
     as to how to proceed.

     I wish you well.

     Sincerely,

     Harold E. Hughes
