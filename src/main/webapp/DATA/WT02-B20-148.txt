<b>Beyond Bridging the Gap: Creating Learning Communities of Research and
Practice</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023G50045 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/99<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and validate a participatory research and development
model that creates learning communities of research and practice.  The ultimate goal of these
communities of research and practice is to impact teacher thinking and instructional behavior in
inclusive classes, the school systems and cultures in which teachers work, university teacher
training and research programs, and the academic outcomes of students with and without
disabilities in inclusive classes.<P>

METHOD:   The project will develop a working model of participatory research and
development
(PR&D).  In the first year, the model will be implemented with ten secondary special and general
education teachers (expanding to 35 teachers in the first three years) to address authentic
instructional problems in the inclusive classrooms of participating teachers.  Descriptive and
intervention studies will determine the effects of teacher involvement in participatory research
and
development on their problem-solving/innovation development process, including their planning,
instructional behaviors, and attitudes.  Intervention studies over the first three years of the project
will determine the effects of teacher participation in the PR&D process and implementation of
classroom teaching and learning strategies in experimental classrooms on the academic
performance of students with mild disabilities as well as those without disabilities (N=80
students
in the first and third years, N=40 in the second). In addition, in each year of the project, the
academic performance of students with and without mild disabilities within experimental classes
will be compared to the academic performance of students with and without disabilities in
classrooms where teachers do not participate in PR&D, but do implement the innovations of
PR&D teachers.  Descriptive studies will address the effects of teacher, administrator, and staff
involvement in participatory research and development on the system, culture, and professional
climate of the schools included in the project. Finally, descriptive studies will determine the
effects
of participation in participatory research and development on the attitudes, future research plans,
and teacher preparation programs involving participating university educators.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:   Project findings will be disseminated through presentations to
peers within participating institutions and regional and national conferences.  Research findings
will be published in practitioner and research journals.<P>

<b>Performance Enhancement Routine for Use in Inclusive Secondary Content
Classrooms</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50143 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/00<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and validate four new routines, called Performance
Enhancement Routines, which will be aimed at overcoming the barriers associated with methods
used to ensure and evaluate mastery of secondary school content.<P>

METHOD:  Components of the Performance Enhancement Routines to be developed and
validated include the following: an Assessment Planning Routine to be used by teachers in
analyzing content they teach and creating assessment tools appropriate to both content and
student characteristics; a Study Guide Routine to help teachers create study guides matched to
assessment tools; a Review Routine to be used as a closure activity through which students can
review important information in cooperative study groups; and a Feedback Routine to provide
feedback to whole classes of students on both content and process aspects of learning.  An
evaluation of effects of the teacher training program on the implementation of this model will be
conducted, as will an evaluation of effects of the instructional model on student performance on
both content measures and motivational factors.  The social validity of the instructional model
will
also be measured by specially designed surveys.  Descriptive studies yielding both quantitative
data from teacher surveys and qualitative data from information received from teacher focus
groups will also be collected.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The routines to be developed through this project will be usable
in combination with current Content Planning Routines and Content Delivery Routines to help
students with disabilities succeed in content-area classes at the secondary level.  Numerous
reports and professional papers will be prepared for presentation and publication through
journals,
conferences, and agency-sponsored training sessions. 
These papers will include the original position paper, results of annual studies, and teacher
training procedures.<P>

<b>A Feasibility Study for a Data-based Tracking   System for Secondary Students with
Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H159F50001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will evaluate the feasibility of implementing a state-wide student
tracking system for Alabama's secondary students and young adults with disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  A follow-along project design will be employed to collect data on both in-school
and
post-school indicators.  The sample will consist of students from Jefferson County (urban) and
Lee County (rural) high schools.  All students over 17 years of age in participating schools will
be
administered a questionnaire (approximately 242 students.)  For the post-school phase, half of all
students who exited these two school systems in the 1994-1995 school year will be administered
the post-school questionnaire via telephone, (approximately 202 post-school participants.) 
Ultimately, the student tracking system would gather information on the same students at both 17
years of age in-school and 9 months post-school.  This information will then be used to identify
links between post-school indicators and specific programs, services, and prior program
improvement activities.  A task force will be developed, to consist of individuals from an array of
state and local agencies representing administrators, educators, and consumers. This group will
translate project outcomes into a set of recommendations for policy formation, adoption, and
implementation in Alabama.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:   The final project report will include a description of the piloted
student tracking system, the developed in-school instrument and revised post-school instrument,
the results of the pilot test in terms of analysis for in-school and post-school indicators, the final
project evaluation report, and the task force's recommendations for policy formation.<P>

<b>Indicators of Integrated Academic/Occupational Curricula in Secondary Classrooms Serving
Students With and Without Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50033 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to develop valid measures of classroom practice that
are sensitive to the level of integration of academic and vocational curricula in a variety of high
school courses, including those experienced by students with disabilities. <P>

METHOD:  Using systematic observation methods in a purposive sample of forty academic,
vocational, and blended classes offered at a comprehensive high school participating in the
Southern Regional Education Board's "High Schools that Work" initiative, project staff will
assess
four domains of curriculum and instruction: (1) content blend; (2) vocational content; (3)
instructional strategy; and (4) student activity.  Data will consist of pre-coded administrative
descriptions of courses and student types (including numbers of students with disabilities),
pre-coded teacher descriptions of courses, daily teacher logs of classroom activity, and observer
logs of classroom activity.  Interobserver agreement, correlational analyses, and teachers' and
observers' structured comments will be used to test the validity of the measures.  Repeated
measures profile analyses will be used to ascertain if there is a profile or set of profiles that are
most likely to occur in high school classes that have been pre-specified as "integrated
academic/occupational courses", such that integrated classes may be differentiated from classes
that do not integrate academic and occupational curriculum.  Additional profile analysis will be
used to determine if student disability is associated with certain curricular and instructional
features and whether those features are similar to those found in classes that integrate academic
and occupational learning.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will develop valid classroom indicators of integrated
curricula based on current conceptual models; an analysis of the utility of the conceptual model
for describing regular and special education classroom activities; measures of reliability of
teacher
reports of integrated curricula; and benchmarks of local practice in the participating school.<P>

<b>General Education Development (GED) Success: Effective Instructional Interventions for
Students with Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023P30004 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will identify and document interventions that provide effective
individualized instructional accommodations and supports for students with learning disabilities
and behavior disorders in secondary GED preparation programs.<P>

METHOD:  A multi-agency Advisory Task Force will identify the needs and barriers to GED
programs that students experience, effective preparation programs and instructors, and
intervention strategies that will address student needs.  Students with disabilities who have
dropped out of Seattle schools will be recruited and assigned to one of three regular education
GED programs: a computer-assisted curriculum for pre-GED and GED preparation; a test-based
GED curriculum based on student strengths and test characteristics; or a program of instructional
accommodation and support based on identification of barriers and successful program features. 
Budget strategies will be identified to capture the FTEs of all target students so that interventions
can be supported without grant funds after the project ends.  Each of these GED interventions
will be evaluated to determine its effectiveness in preparing students to successfully complete the
GED subtests.  Students who successfully complete these interventions will be compared with
students who do not complete them, and a control group of nonenrollees on occupational, social,
and personal outcomes.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:    Information on effective GED practices identified in this
project
will be disseminated to secondary and postsecondary program sites, professional and advocacy
organizations, and state and federal offices.<P>

<b>Students' Entrepreneurial Education Research Project</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50080 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  5/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  4/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate the relationship between entrepreneurial education and
the development of self-mastery skills for secondary students with emotional disorders during
school and upon exit or graduation from high school.<P>

METHOD:  Using a three-level entrepreneurial curriculum, staff will work with 55-75 students
ages 6 through 21 who are participating in three different alternative programs as a result of
failure in a mainstreamed secondary education environment.  Staff will coordinate project
activities and facilitate a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency advisory and service team to include
students, teachers, counselors, entrepreneur mentors, employers, parents, law enforcement
representatives, and representatives of social service agencies.  A case study approach using a
participatory action research model will provide the qualitative component of the project's
evaluation, while standardized measurement tools combined with subjective assessments by
entrepreneurial coordinators will provide quantitative evaluation. The business community will
be
drawn in to help determine specific employability skills they want to see in potential new
employees, and mentors will provide support as each class plans, develops, and implements an
entrepreneurial enterprise.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings will be presented at local, state and national
conferences directed towards teachers, administrators, related services personnel, adult service
providers, parents and students with emotional disorders.  The Colorado Department of
Education will disseminate the finished curriculum state-wide, and staff will submit process and
research articles to relevant professional journals.<P>

<b>The Development and Validation of a GED Proficiency Attainment Model for Students with
Learning Disabilities and Severe Emotional Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023P30008 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This program will identify barriers to GED program participation and completion
for
students with learning disabilities (LD) and severe emotional disturbances (SED) who drop out
of high school.  The project will also design, implement, and evaluate an intervention model to
accommodate these students' needs related to completion.<P>

METHOD:  In the first phase of the project, those involved in the GED process will participate in
interviews, focus group meetings, and/or observations.  These data sources will provide
information describing the current needs of students and instructors in GED programs.  In
collaboration with those involved, an intervention package will be designed for implementation
and evaluation in the second research phase.  One product will be an intervention model
generalizable to other GED programs.  The intervention model will address academic and
self-management skills as major areas influencing GED participation and completion.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The instructional model will consist of three packages: (1) a
Recruitment Package; (2) a GED Preparation Package (consisting of the Strategies Application
Component, the Strategic Tutoring Component, the Content Enhancement Component, and the
Self-Management Component); and (3) a Test Performance Package.  In each area, learning and
self-management strategies and related needs of students with LD and SED will be addressed in
conjunction with the teaching skills and programmatic influences on participation and
completion.<P>

<b>Research in Self-Determination of Students with Cognitive Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40126 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/99<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct an empirical examination of the causal relationship
between
self-determination and positive adult outcomes through a longitudinal follow-along study of
school graduates with cognitive disabilities, including mental retardation and learning
disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  This project spans five areas of research that staff members will conduct over a
period of 5 years.  First, through a longitudinal follow-along study, staff members will explore
the
causal relationship between self-determination and adult outcomes.  Using precollected data
related to self-determination status and demographic information, project staff will monitor
participants' progress at 1 and 3 years after graduation, including employment status,
postsecondary education status, marital status, and perceived quality of life.  Participants
recruited
for this component will include students (N=150) with mild to moderate levels of mental
retardation and severe learning disabilities.  Self-determination assessments will include five
domains: (1) autonomy; (2) self-regulation; (3) self-actualization; (4) perceptions of
psychological
empowerment; and (5) perceptions of self.  In the second, third, and fourth components, staff will
describe the development of self-determination through various means, including a longitudinal
study of perceptions of control and attributions of academic achievement.  Students ranging in
age
from 8 to 19 years will participate, including those with mental retardation, learning disabilities,
and students who are not disabled. During each project year, staff will assess each student on
various measures studying locus of control, perceptions of helplessness, and other research foci. 
The final area of research involves the development and field testing of a model of teaching that
distributes the responsibility for learning among teachers, parents, and students, giving primary
control to the student.  Participating students will be the primary agents for choices and decisions
at each phase of the model's development.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project research activities will result in data detailing the causal
link between self- determination and adult outcomes and describing the developmental course of
constituent elements of self- determination. Project demonstration activities will result in the
validation of a model of teaching that can be used to promote self-determination.  Project
materials will be distributed to national organizations, journals, and conferences.<P>
