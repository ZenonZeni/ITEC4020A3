<BODY>

<H2>Transportation External Coordination Working Group (TEC)</H2><HR>

The Transportation External Coordination Working Group was established in 1992 to

coordinate emergency preparedness policies related to shipments by the Department of

Energy, including the Department of Energy's obligation to provide funding and

technical assistance for training under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act.  Since 1992, this

group has extended its focus to general planning, safe routine transportation, inspection

and enforcement, emergency management, training, technical assistance, and public

information and education.  Membership in the Transportation External Coordination

Working Group is composed of appropriate Department of Energy organizations,

regional and national organizations representing State, Tribal, and local governments; and

industry representatives.  OCRWM and the Department of Energy's Office of

Environmental Management jointly chair this group.  Meetings of the Transportation

External Coordination Working Group are held semi-annually and are open to the

public.
