CREATING JOBS DECLARED MAIN CHALLENGE FACING GERMANY IN 1996

Reducing Germany's stubbornly high unemployment, the country's
leaders agreed as 1995 drew to a close, stands as the most
important task for the coming year. Across the political
spectrum, German politicians acknowledged that creating new
jobs must be given the highest priority in public policy.
Religious and labor leaders warned, however, that job creation
must not come at the expense of the social welfare system.
Speaking to the nation in his annual New Year's Eve address,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said "the battle against unemployment"
would be his government's main concern in 1996. The German
economy, he noted, continues to expand, but growth has not
brought about a much needed breakthrough on the job front. New
thinking is necessary, the chancellor insisted as he promised
that job creation would be the focus of talks between the
government, labor leaders and representatives of industry, "We
will be able to address the future successfully only if we find
common answers to the issues that concern us," he said. "Every
reasonable proposal, every forward-looking initiative should be
considered and not rejected out of hand or subjected to the
destructive effects of sustained public controversy." Given
plans to curtail government bureaucracy and cutbacks at major
corporations, much of the impetus for job creation will have to
come from small and medium-sized businesses, Germany's famed
Mittelstand, Kohl went on to argue, and particular attention
must be given to encouraging new businesses and self-
employment. "Anyone who starts up anew business in our country
creates employment and a living for an average of four
additional persons," he observed. "In Germany, we need a new
spirit of enthusiasm for business start-ups. We need men and
women who are self-confident and able to translate their ideas
into action."
Like the chancellor, Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth (CDU)
called for a "unprejudiced" examination of a broad variety of
proposals to boost employment. Suessmuth, speaking in a radio
interview New Year's Day, cited the "Alliance for Work"
recently put forward by the industrial union IG Metall as one
such proposal that warrents serious consideration (cf. TWIG
11/3/95, p.4). Last November, union head Klaus Ziwckel
suggested labor would be willing to forego wage increases in
exchange for guarantees of job security from employers and an
end to government plans to cut social welfare spending. In
addition to considering proposals like that, Suessmuth said,
emphasis has to be placed on investment. That includes not only
investment in the industries of tomorrow, she stressed, but
also in efforts to put people back to work, even if in only
menial jobs and even if at the taxpayers' expense. That could
lead to higher social security deductions from the paychecks of
the employed, Suessmuth acknowledged, but otherwise the social
welfare systems is threatened with collapse as growing numbers
of Germans - the unemployed and holders of exempted low-wage
jobs (see story page 5) - find themselves unable to contribute.
An "alliance for the social state," according to the public
employees' union DAG, is needed to protect Germany's social
welfare system against excessive cuts in the interests of
employers. "Attacks on the social system by employers and
politicians make it necessary to organize social counter forces
in 1996," DAG board member Lutz Freitag told reporters in
Hamburg at the year's close. It is incompatible with the goals
set out in the Basic Law, Germany's constitution, that the less
affluent are increasingly being pushed to the margins of German
society, he said. That message was echoed by Bishop Klaus
Engelhard of Hannover (Lower Saxony), chair of the governing
board of Germany's Evangelical Church. The growing gap between
rich and poor, the bishop said in his New Year's Eve sermon,
threatens Germany's social consensus. He thus welcomed
Zwickel's call for an "Alliance for Work" and urged labor and
industry to sit down with the government for talks.

HERZOG PROCLAIMS JANUARY 27 DAY OF REMEMBRANCE FOR VICTIMS OF
NAZISM

January 27 will henceforth be a national day of remembrance for
the victims of Nazism, President Roman Herzog of Germany has
proclaimed. It was on that day in 1945 that the Auschwitz
concentration camp was liberated. Auschwitz, the president
noted in a proclamation he issued Wednesday (January 3), stands
as a symbol of the Nazis' racist and genocidal policies. The
Nazi terror must never be forgotten, Herzog said, and future
generations must be made mindful of what happened in Germany
during the Third Reich so that nothing comparable will ever
again be allowed to occur. The newly designated day of
remembrance will pay tribute to the millions of men, women and
children who were tortured and murdered by the Nazis, to every
individual who suffered persecution and disenfranchisement
during the twelve-year nightmare of the Third Reich.
The day after Herzog made his proclamation, Bundestag President
Rita Suessmuth (CDU) announced that the parliament will hold a
session to commemorate the victims of  Nazism on January 19.
President Herzog, she said, had agreed to address the special
session.

NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA AFFIRMATIVE ACTION LAW TO REMAIN IN
EFFECT DESPITE COURT RULING

An affirmation action law will remain in effect in the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia despite a court ruling against it, state
officials indicated late last month. On December 19, a state
superior administrative court (Oberverwaltungsgericht) in
Muenster rejected a petition from a woman who had been passed
over for a promotion in favor of a male colleague. Under North
Rhine-Westphalia's law to advance equality in the workplace,
women are to be favored over men with comparable skills and
qualifications in hiring and promotion until the office or
department in question has equal numbers of men and women. In
rejecting the petition, the court, which had previously
declared the law unconstitutional, invoked a recent ruling by
the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The European court
ruled in October that a similar affirmative action law in the
state of Bremen violated guarantees of equal treatment for all
individuals contained in European Union law (cf. TWIG 10/20/95,
p.4).
Minister of Women Ilse Ridder-Melcher (SPD) of North Rhine-
Westphalia announced that the disputed law will remain in
effect because the superior administrative court does not have
the authority o invalidate a law passed by the state
parliament. Only the Federal Constitutional Court, she noted,
can do so. Approximately 40 men have sought to challenge the
constitutionality of the North Rhine-Westphalia affirmative
action law since the beginning of the decade, but all have
ultimately withdrawn their complaints upon receiving promotion.
Two men, Ridder-Melcher said, recently filed complaints against
the law.
Comparing North Rhine-Westphalia's law on promoting women with
Bremen's, Ridder-Melchers told the Frankfurter Rundschau, is
like comparing apples and oranges. In North Rhine-Westphalia's,
she notes, women are not automatically given preference over
men. Each case must be reviewed individually to assure that the
man or men involved are not put under unfair hardship by hiring
or promoting women in their place. This clause, in Ridder-
Melcher's view, puts North Rhine-Westphalia's law on more solid
legal footing than Bremen's. In 1993, she said, the Federal
Labor Court upheld the validity of the law.

NUMBER OF ETHNIC GERMAN RESETTLERS DROPPED IN 1995

The number of ethnic Germans resettling in the Federal Republic
dropped slightly last year, the Federal Ministry of the
Interior announced Monday (January 1). In 1995, a total of
217,898 ethnic Germans registered as resettlers in Germany,
roughly 5,000 fewer than the 222,591 who did in 1994. The
overwhelming majority (209,409) came from the successor states
to the Soviet Union. Most of the remainder came from either
Romania (6,519) or Poland (1,677). During 1995, German
authorities received 260,556 applications from ethnic Germans
seeking to resettle in the Federal Republic. Approximately
100,00 ethnic Germans in the former East Bloc, the ministry
reports, have received permission to emigrate to the Federal
Republic but have not yet done so. Ministry officials believe
most do not intend to use their entry permits unless an
emergency arises.
Not all the ethnic Germans leaving their homes in the Central
Asiatic states of the Commonwealth of Independent States are
resettling in Germany. According to Ministry of the Interior
Parliamentary State Secretary Horst Waffenschmidt (CDU),
approximately 10,000 ethnic Germans left Central Asia for the
Russian Federation. Many settled in western Siberia, which has
a 600,000-strong German minority. Both Russia and Germany,
Waffenschmidt noted, support this migration.
The number of ethnic Germans who opt to resettle in Germany
during the coming year will depend on the political situation
in the Commonwealth of Independent States, Waffenschmidt said.
Germany's goal is to accept a limited number of resettlers
while providing development aid to German minorities in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet republics. Particular emphasis
will be placed on intensifying ties between Germany and ethnic
German communities this year. Germany is contributing toward
the construction of community centers which will offer, among
services, courses in the German language. More aid will also be
offered this year to support small and medium-sized businesses
in ethnic German communities.

THE PRESS ON THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW

Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
(January 2) "It seems 1996 will be the year of alliances in
German economic policy. The chancellor, as part of a general
plan of action, wants to join in the `alliance for jobs,'
proposed by Klaus Zwickel, chairperson of the IG Metall
metalworkers union. SPD party leader Oskar Lafontaine would
like to bring all the social forces into an `employment pact.'
And the Public Employees Union, suspecting that meetings with
the chancellor and employment experts have involved a critical
look at social (security) costs, is making a cautionary appeal
to the churches of an `alliance for the social state'
(Sozialstaat).
Those rubrics indicate the right priorities. Reducing
unemployment is the most urgent economic issue for Germany. The
connection between unemployment and social costs is a spiral
into fiscal calamity: social welfare payments increase business
costs, leading to unemployment, and unemployment requires
increased contributions to let the social fund bear the costs
of joblessness. If there is no action, the society moves toward
ever higher unemployment, a prisoner of the social spiral it
constructed. The necessity of halting that fateful turn needs
no further explanation. That brings up the question how.
Zwickel's proposal makes clear, above all, where the risk is in
a new collectivism of alliances. Unemployment has occured
because the wages reached through collective bargaining don't
correspond to the employment requirements of employees and the
profit and loss position of businesses. The errors of these
collective agreements are now supposed to be cured by an even
more far-reaching collective agreement. In exchange for a
promise vaguely binding them to moderation, the partners of
the `alliance,' in the stead of business, are promising to
procure hundreds of thousands of jobs, and the state should
forget about revising the social system. That will not work;
high employment won't come out of it.
From the point of view of the unions, however, the Zwickel
alliance has an entirely different aim: to bring in the unions
as players in the center of a corporative policy. One shouldn't
fall into that trap."

Sueddeutsche Zeitung
(Munich, December 30) "It's difficult enough to read between
the lines, even harder to extract the insinuations. Helmut
Kohl's New Year's speech will not make it easy for readers or
listeners, at least not those who are interested in finding out
from the chancellor what the new year will really bring by way
of problems or opportunities.. `Much has gone well, but not
everything.' If that isn't the epitaph of the year! Or maybe
even better: `In retrospective we are looking backwards, but
the future is ours only if we are confident.'
Jokes aside, the chancellor is stating the obvious: no
breakthrough in employment. But he isn't what he needs to:
tighten those belts a little tighter! Business people should
stop complaining and get down to business! It's time to
redefine and rediscover social consensus in the face of vastly
changed worldwide market conditions! Be more flexible! Less
vacation! More participation in (meeting) social costs from
those who can do so! And everything else you could put an
exclamation point to...
Instead, Kohl clothes the need to save and cut down and be
realistic in vague terms: `There can't be any exceptions.' And
he promises a new growth of small and medium-sized businesses.
Where will that come from? `Ideas' and the `courage of
independence' do not suffice. Public policy needs the courage
to create the right conditions. But maybe it's too much to ask
for anything concrete on New Year's Eve. During the night
fireworks will explode into momentary dreams. Then it soon will
be day again with plenty of time for the truth."

General-Anzeiger
(Bonn, December 30) "The social state is not the cause of
structural change (in German society), but rather it makes the
consequences of (that change) - in particular mass unemployment
- at least halfway endurable, since it saddles everyone (with
responsibility) for them. Whoever shrinks (the social state)
too severely will not only create room for maneuver for new
investment, but also a different society. But solidarity is not
a one-way street, not in the family or in the work place or in
politics. The French learned this painfully during the weeks of
strikes before Christmas. It is obvious to say but difficult to
put into action: the Germans must act together to meet the
challenges they face."

Berliner Morgenpost
(December 30) "For better or worse, our leisure and good-time
society will have to get used to the fact that unified Germany
has taken on a new role in international politics. That does
not mean first and foremost more prestige, but rather more
responsibility, which is an encumbrance to each and every
individual citizen. We are flattered to be considered one of
the world's prosperous, indeed rich nations, when Germany is
admired for its political and economic stability. But we are
overcome with dread when we think about the transformation of
the D-mark into the euro. So, too, is sending German troops
into a war zone for the first time ever, where they might
become involved in combat actions, part of the price that an
enlarged Germany has to pay.

YEAR'S END BRINGS REVISIONS IN ECONOMIC FORECASTS

As 1995 drew to a close, a handful of Germany's leading
economics institutes made last minute revisions in their
predictions of the country's economic performance. Each fall,
six research institutes join in presenting a report on their
expectations for the German economy. This past October, the six
agreed that growth for 1995 would stand at about 2.25 percent
and reach 2.5 percent in 1996 (cf. TWIG 10/27/95, p.4). Three
of the six announced in late December, however, that they had
been over optimistic in their outlook for the coming year. In
its December monthly report, the Federal Ministry of Economics
likewise pointed to disappointing economic performance in the
second half of 1995, but nonetheless predicted continued
economic recovery in the next twelve months.
The Munich-based Ifo institute announced on December 20 that it
now expects economic growth of 2.0 percent for 1995 and 1.75
percent for 1996 rather than the previously anticipated 2.25
and 2.5 percent.. The institute cited disappointing capital
investment figures for the second half of 1995 in issuing its
revised forecast, but stressed that it does not expect Germany
to slip into recession. Private consumption boosted by tax
breaks will help the economy, according to Ifo, and investment
and exports are expected to recover from the effects of a
strong D-mark and high wage settlements. But unemployment will
change little over the year and probably drop by only one-tenth
of a percent o 9.5 percent, Ifo now believes. Hamburg's HWWA
Institute for Economic Research similarly announced that it now
expects economic growth of only 2.0 percent for 1995, but, like
Ifo, it believes the recovery process should pick up in 1996
and that the German economy will not slip into recession
The Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research said it
still expects 2.25 percent growth for 1995, but maintained that
the German economy is not performing as well as it could. The
anticipated growth, the institute added, will hardly help
change the employment situation in Germany as a whole; it
foresees a reduction in unemployment only in the eastern half
of the country. In the view the Institute for Economic Research
(IWH), Halle (Saxony-Anhalt), the eastern economy should grow
by 4.8 percent in 1996. Limited growth in the west, according
to IWH, will slow growth in the east.
Acknowledging a number of factors slowing Germany's economic
recovery, the Federal Ministry of Economics pointed to others
in its December report that should give the economy a boost in
coming months. Low interest rates, stable prices and increases
in household incomes arising from tax cuts should help lift the
economy after 1995's disappointing fourth quarter. Preliminary
data on fourth quarter production, contracts and wholesale
prices, the report said, suggest that growth in the second half
of the year will stand at about 1.5 percent, a marked drop from
the 2.6 percent registered in the first six months of 1995.

COMPUSERVE RESTRICTS ACCESS TO 200 IN RESPONSE TO GERMAN
INVESTIGATION

The computer network firm CompuServe announced Friday (December
29) that it was restricting access to 200 Internet sites in
response to an investigation by public prosecutors in Munich.
In late November, the public prosecutor's office in Munich
launched an investigation to determine whether the CompuServe
network was being used to distribute materials that violate
German law. Specifically, prosecutors believe child pornography
and pornographic materials legally off limits to minors are
being disseminated via CompuServe's German subsidiary,
CompuServe GmbH. To forestall any further violations of German
law, officials at CompuServe's headquarters in the United
States said they were blocking access to 200 sites dealing with
sexual topics. The restrictions will affect CompuServe users
around the world because, as the company explained, it cannot
currently tailor its services to meet the different national
laws in each of the countries where it has subscribers.
CompuServe says it provides network services to over four
million subscribers throughout the world, including 220,000 in
the German-speaking nations. According to the public
prosecutors office, officials at CompuServe GmbH's Munich
office voluntarily turned over materials to investigators on
November 22. CompuServe has emphasized that it cannot control
what its subscribers make available through the Internet and
called for investigations that are "specifically focused on
those people and groups that place materials on the Internet."
Chief Prosecutor Manfred Wick told reporters Tuesday (January
2) that his office has sought the advice of technical experts
to determine whether the providers of online services are
capable of preventing the distribution of illegal materials.

EUROPE ONLINE JOINS RANKS OF NETWORK PROVIDERS IN GERMANY

Competition among the providers of online services in Germany
became tighter on December 15 as Europe Online went into
operation. The newcomer joins America Online's AOL Europa,
CompuServe, Deutsche Telekom and Microsoft in the race for
subscribers in Germany, where a well-educated population of 80
million makes for a potentially lucrative market. Europe Online
is based Luxembourg and provides services in English, French
and German. Germany's Burda Verlag, the publisher of the
magazines Focus and Bunte, has a 30-percent stake in the
venture.
Another major German media concern, the Axel Springer Verlag,
had planned to participate in Europe Online. Springer, which
publishes the widely read tabloid newspaper Bild, decided
instead to team up with the Bertelsmann media conglomerate and
Deutsche Telekom, the German national phone company, in
participating in America Online's AOL Europa.

SOCIAL SECURITY EXEMPTION FOR LOW-WAGE WORKERS DECLARED VALID

Germany's exemption on social welfare contributions for workers
in low-paying jobs, the Luxembourg-based European Court of
Justice ruled last month, does not violate European Union law
and is thus valid. Under German law, workers with monthly
incomes of less than DM 580 (about U.S. $400) do not pay into
the social security system that provides pensions, unemployment
benefits and health insurance. Local courts in Hannover (Lower
Saxony) and Speyer (Rheinland-Pfalz) brought the case before
the European Court of Justice on behalf of three female
domestic workers. According to the local courts, the German law
is discriminatory because the great majority of those who hold
so-called "580 Mark jobs" are women. Dismissing that line of
argument, the European Court of Justice backed the German
government's right to use the exemption to "achieve a socio-
political goal." Bonn maintains that without the exemption,
low-wage jobs would disappear without any corresponding
increase in full-time, higher-wage employment.
The number of people holding "580 Mark jobs" is estimated at
between 4.5 and 6.0 million. By the calculations of the Munich-
based Sueddeutsche Zeitung, about a quarter of them are
employed in private households. Many of the rest hold part-time
jobs in retail sales, manufacturing, and the hotel and
restaurant industry. Other European countries, including
Belgium, France, Great Britain, Ireland and Luxembourg, have
similar social-service exemptions for low wage earners.

"MULTIMEDIA": WAVE OF THE FUTURE SELECTED AS WORD OF THE YEAR

Multimedia," pundits say, is the inevitable wave of the future,
but in the past year, according to the preeminent monitors of
the German tongue, it was the inescapable buzzword of the
moment. The Society for German Language (Gesellschaft fuer
Deutsche Sprache) proclaimed "multimedia" 1995's "World of the
Year" late last month, citing its broad influence on recent
public discussion and debate. "We found a five hundred-percent
increase in the use of the concept `multimedia' this year,"
society spokesperson Gerhard Mueller explained in announcing
the Word of the Year. "Multimedia is the guiding term
(Leitwort) for the journey into the brave new media world."
There will hardly be an area of everyday life, Mueller and his
colleagues speculate, that will not be touched by advances in
information technology in the none too distant future.
Another change on the horizon - if Europe's political leaders
hold firm to newly approved plans - will be the introduction of
a common Eurogeld ("Euro-currency"), the runner-up on the Word
of the Year list. Third place went to the much-discussed
Kruzifixurteil ("crucifix judgement"). In August, the Federal
Constitutional Court ruled that a Bavarian ordinance mandated
the hanging of crucifixes in public school classrooms violated
Germany's constitution, the Basic Law (cf. TWIG 9/8/95, p.6).
The ruling provoked indignation from many Bavarian politicians
and large public protests throughout the state. Prime Minister
Edmund Stoiber (CSU) and his cabinet subsequently drafted
legislation that would change the wording of Bavaria's school
ordinances but still keep crucifixes in the great majority of
classrooms (cf. TWIG 9/15/95, p.7).
Religious concerns also stood behind the society's "Motto of
the Year," Wir sind Kirche ("We are the Church"). The line
served as both the name and the rallying cry of a lay Catholic
initiative calling for reforms within the Roman Catholic Church
(cf. TWIG 11/24/95, p.6; 12/8/95, p.7). Wir sind Kirche
gathered 1.8 million signatures on petition calling for an end
to obligatory clerical celibacy and the prohibition on the
ordination of women, among other changes.
Until last year, the Society for German Language designated the
Unwoerter ("non-words") of the year, the most unfortunate
expressions to enter the language. The Unwoerter selection
committee and the society parted ways in 1994 in the wake of a
controversy over the inclusion of kollektiver Freizeitpark
("collective leisure park"), a term used by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl to criticize Germany's extensive social welfare system,
among the Unwoerter of 1993 (cf. TWIG 1/6/95, p.6). The six-
person selection jury, a spokesperson reported Tuesday (January
2), has received a record number of suggestions from the
general public for 1995's Unwort of the Year. The jury's
verdict is expected later this month.

HEINER MUELLER, LEADING FIGURE IN GERMAN THEATER, DIES FROM
CANCER-RELATED ILLNESS

Heiner Mueller, one of Germany's most respected and most
controversial post-war playwrites, died Saturday (December 30),
a week and a half short of his 67th birthday. The author of
over 30 pieces for the stage, Mueller also earned acclaim for
his work as director and drama theorist. His professional
success was anything but straightforward, however. Mueller was
a Marxist and long time member of the German Democratic
Republic's governing Socialist Unity Party, but he was
temporarily forbidden to publish or stage his socially critical
work in the GDR. From the mid 1960s on, Mueller's plays tended
to be staged more frequently in the Federal Republic and other
nations than in the GDR. Yet even though the East German
authorities were often less than enthusiastic about Mueller's
cynical tone, they nonetheless acknowledged the merit of his
work. In 1986, he was awarded the GDR National Prize for Art
and Literature, one of the country's highest honors. Mueller's
independent stance before the collapse of the GDR was much
lauded, but not long after unification it was revealed he had
served as an "unofficial collaborator" - i.e., as an informer -
for the Stasi, East Germany's secret police. Mueller,
acknowledging that he had been in regular contact with the
Stasi, said he had tried to advise the authorities and to use
his influence constructively.
At the time of his death, Mueller was the artistic director of
the Berliner Ensemble, the theater company founded by Bertold
Brecht in eastern Berlin shortly after the establishment of the
GDR. Like all eastern German cultural institutions, the
Berliner Ensemble entered a period of change and uncertainty
after unification. Mueller was appointed to serve as one of
four co-directors to guide the venerable company's way into the
future. The four-person directorship fell apart late in the
winter of 1995, however, and Mueller, despite having recently
undergone surgery for cancer of the esophagus, accepted an
invitation to take over as sole artistic director.
The members of the Berliner Ensemble, joining with the rest of
the German theatrical and literary community in mourning
Mueller's death, are honoring Mueller's memory with a marathon
reading program. On Tuesday (January 2), company member Hans
Fleischmann began reading Mueller's piece Bericht vom Gro_vater
("Grandfather's Report") before an audience of about two dozen.
The readings will continue through January 9, the day Mueller
would have turned 67.

THE G-7 NATIONS PLEDGE $2.3 BILLION TO HELP CLOSE CHERNOBYL

Plans for the eventual shutdown of the infamous Chernobyl
nuclear power plant came a step closer to realization in late
December as Ukraine and the leading industrial nations came to
a provisional agreement on a financial aid package. The
industrial nations agreed in principle this past spring, nine
years after the accident that made Chernobyl a household word
around the world, to help offset the costs of closing the
hobbled but still operating power plant (cf. TWIG 4/21/95,
p.5). At that time, the amount of aid Ukraine could expect in
exchange for agreeing to shut Chernobyl was left undetermined;
Ukrainian authorities estimated the shutdown would cost a total
of U.S. $4.4 billion. In a statement of intention signed
December 20, the G-7 nations (Canada, France, Germany, Great
Britain, Italy, Japan and the U.S.) declared themselves
prepared to contribute U.S. $500 million in direct toward the
cost of taking Chernobyl out of operation once and for all. The
G-7 and the European Union are also prepared to make available
another $1.8 billion in credits for construction of power
plants to replace Chernobyl. These figures are "targets,"
explained Ukrainian Minister of the Environment Yuri Kostenko.
Further negotiations, he added, will be needed to work out the
details. Canadian Minister of the Environment Shelia Copps, who
signed the statement of intention on behalf of the entire G-7,
described the signing of the statement of intention marked only
the beginning of Chernobyl's closing, a process she said will
take several years to complete. Under current plans, Chernobyl
will be taken out of operation by the year 2000. "Germany is
especially interested in the concrete shell over reactor four,"
a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Ministry of the Environment
told the German Press Agency (dpa) the day after the statement
of intention was signed. Ukraine, he added, hopes to negotiate
bilateral aid agreements with the G-7 nations in the next
several weeks so that formal agreements can be signed at a
summit on nuclear security scheduled to take place in Moscow
this March.

SCHOLARS QUESTION CLAIM OF A MAJOR LUTHER DISCOVERY

Readers who can't resist the urge to write in books might be
the bane of librarians' lives, unless, of course, the reader in
question happens to be a major historical figure. If, as some
scholars believe, recently discovered notations in a bible came
from the pen of Martin Luther, the Wuerttemberg State Library,
Stuttgart, will be able to boast of a unique treasure. If, as
others maintain, the marginalia was written by a follower of
Luther's, the library is left with an old book containing old
notes of interest to only a small circle of specialists.
In late November, a researcher named Manuel Santos Noya
announced he had discovered extensive comments in Luther's hand
in a copy of the Vulgate bible, that is, in a copy of the Latin
version of the bible that was considered the authoritative text
of the scriptures in Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages.
Santos Noya argued that the copy of the Vulgate he found in the
Wuerttemberg State Library was the copy Luther had used in
preparing his German translation of the bible. That translation
is widely credited with having played a decisive role in the
development of modern written German, much as the "King James"
translation influenced English prose. If Santos Noya is
correct, the marginal comments he found could throw new light
on Luther's thinking as he prepared his translation and thus
upon an epochal event in German cultural history.
Other scholars have been quick to point to weak points in
Santos Noya's case. Professor Ulrich Bubenheimer of the
University of Heidelberg (Baden-Wuerttemberg), a theologian who
is regarded an authority on sixteenth-century handwriting,
agreed that the marginalia Santos Noya found is written in a
hand that shows many similarities to Luther's, but also many
differences, especially in the way Greek and Hebrew characters
are written. According to Bubenheimer, it was not unusual for
students in the sixteenth century to pattern their handwriting
upon their teachers. Luther's close collaborator Philipp
Melanchthon (1497-1560), he notes by way of example, wrote in a
hand that resembled Luther's.
Bubenheimer and other Luther scholars have underscored
additional  evidence that similarly points to a follower of
Luther rather than Luther himself as the annotator of the
Stuttgart bible. Some one wrote the date January 28,1528 at the
beginning of the text and November 14, 1528 at the end,
suggesting that the annotations were written during that
eleven-month period. Luther, on the other hand, did his
translation of the New Testment in 1521-1522. The annotator
also cites Luther's writings and mentions Luther by name or by
his initials when he does so; Luther is not known to have
followed such a practice. Finally, the initials IW are written
at the end of the text. Bubenheimer and like-minded scholars
suspect that they refer to the owner of the bible who made the
disputed annotations.

KOHL REIGNS SUPREME IN EDITIONAL CARTOONS

The figures are in, and now there's no disputing Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's political stature. An inventory of 110 daily and
weekly newspapers, the German Press Agency (dpa) reports, has
determined that the chancellor was far and away the country's
most frequently caricatured political personality during 1995.
His distinctively well-fed figure - no doubt a godsend to
cartoonists - appeared in a total of 1,127 editorial cartoons,
more than twice as many as the runner-up, Federal Minister of
Finance Theo Waigel (CDU). Waigel's luxuriant eyebrows turned
up in just under 500 cartoons, making them about as well known
to newspaper readers as his unceasing efforts to trim the
federal budget. Lest anyone think Germany's cartoonists unduly
partisan, Rudolf Scharping, until November the national leader
of the opposition Social Democrats, came in a close Third
behind Waigel.
