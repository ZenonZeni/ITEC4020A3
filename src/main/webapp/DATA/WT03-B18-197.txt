are now serving the Old Town Transit Center (OTTC).  The OTTC is the terminus for
San Diego Trolley's new 3.2 mile extension from downtown San Diego to Old Town. 
The extension joins the Trolley's existing South Line, renamed the North-South Line,
a 19.3 mile light rail line that runs from the OTTC to the San Ysidro Station at
the U. S. International Border with Mexico.<p>

<li><b>Old Town Transit Center - A Regional Hub.</b> This new multi-modal transit
center provides connections between the San Diego Trolley (North-South and East Lines),
10 bus routes, and Coaster trains.  Taxi and hotel shuttles are also available, as
well as bicycle lockers, an approximate 500 space parking lot for State Park and
transit patrons, and a 110 foot long passageway that allows pedestrians to travel
safely underneath the tracks.</li>

Center/Little Italy station to the OTTC. The new line includes three stations: Middletown/Palm
Street, Washington Street, and the OTTC. Service operates from approximately 4:50AM
to about midnight.  On weekdays, trains operate every 10 minutes during rush hours
and every 15 minutes during midday and early evening. During later evening hours,
there are 30 minute frequencies until midnight.</li>

Trolley and Coaster to provide convenient transfers to a variety of locations including:
Centre City, Sea World, Point Loma, Ocean Beach, Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, La
Jolla, Fashion Valley, Clairemont, Hillcrest, and Sorrento Mesa.  Bus routes also
provide direct service to
