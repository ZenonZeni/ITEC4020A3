<BR>
Dear Dan:<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your letter to Drug Watch International about the drug<BR>
legalization issue.  My name is Bob Peterson and I have been asked to respond<BR>
on behalf of our organization.<BR>
<BR>
I have enclosed a pamphlet about Drug Watch.  We are a group of volunteers,<BR>
both professional and lay persons ( I am an attorney), who are dedicated
to<BR>
preventing drug use and ensuring that the facts about drugs are known. 
None<BR>
of us are paid for our Drug Watch work, but all of us share a deep concern<BR>
for young people and are committed to drug prevention.  We also have no<BR>
affiliation with any government agency.  Drug Watch leaders include parents,<BR>
drug treatment professionals, medical doctors, attorneys, educators, and<BR>
community prevention experts.   <BR>
<BR>
You asked what Drug Watch does and what kind of people Drug Watch helps?
 Our<BR>
information, training, and advice has been tapped by a broad range of<BR>
individuals, from high school students (such as yourself) to national and<BR>
international government leaders.  We have helped parents find treatment
for<BR>
their children; helped communities discover resources and ideas to close
drug<BR>
houses; and, we have provided medical, scientific, and legal advice and<BR>
updates to professionals and community based groups.  Mainly, we have helped<BR>
counter the huge barrage of pro-drug propaganda that dominates the Internet,<BR>
the media, and the entertainment industry.  Millions of dollars has been<BR>
poured into the pro-drug legalization movement over the past few years and<BR>
almost no money has been spent to balance it.  While we cannot counter the<BR>
funding we do provide a balance to their barrage of misinformation.<BR>
<BR>
Why do we feel that controlling drugs is the right thing to do?  For many<BR>
reasons, but the top reason is probably to protect children.  All of us
lived<BR>
through the 1970's when drug legalization was a popular idea and even the<BR>
President talked of decriminalizing pot.  Our nation's attitude was very<BR>
permissive toward drugs and although drug arrests were made, the<BR>
incarceration rate for drugs went down dramatically.  The result was record<BR>
drug use among high school students and among adults as well.  In 1979,<BR>
nearly one in ten high school seniors was stoned on pot every day of the
week<BR>
and drug incarceration rates were at an all time low point - support for
drug<BR>
legalization was at an all time high.<BR>
<BR>
Drug prevention combined with tougher drug control in the 1980's brought<BR>
about a less permissive attitude and less acceptance of drugs.  This resulted<BR>
in cutting the use of drugs in half from 1980-1992, especially among young<BR>
adults and children.  Support for drug legalization fell also and drug<BR>
incarceration rates rose for the first time since the year 1960.  However,
in<BR>
the past few years things have begun to change again.  The pro-drug<BR>
legalization movement grew by millions of dollars and support for drug<BR>
legalization went up again.  The use of drugs, especially pot, has doubled<BR>
among teens in just four years!<BR>
<BR>
Legalizing drugs would not solve any of our social problems.  You mentioned<BR>
prison overcrowding.  There is a lot of propaganda about this issue.  Did
you<BR>
know that 93% of prisoners are repeat or violent offenders and that first<BR>
time non-violent marijuana offenders make up only 1/10th of 1% of the prison<BR>
population (and these might have been dealers who pled down).  Alcohol is<BR>
legal and yet there are three times as many alcohol related arrests than<BR>
there are drug arrests.  If drugs were legal there would likely be a 300%<BR>
increase in drug arrests, not a decrease! <BR>
<BR>
From 1960-1980 the drug incarceration rate (the % of drug convicts actually<BR>
locked up) dropped by 374% and violent crime and property crime skyrocketed.<BR>
 The murder rate peaked the year that drug incarceration rates were at an
all<BR>
time low point.  Nearly all of the drug prisoners are hardcore criminals
who<BR>
make their living out of crime, when you lock up the drug dealer you also<BR>
have locked up the mugger and the burglar!  From 1980-1994 the drug<BR>
incarceration rate rose swiftly and crime of all types went down - especially<BR>
property crimes that victimize the most people.  I have enclosed a few pages<BR>
of my book on this topic for you.<BR>
<BR>
You mentioned the cost of drug regulation.  Of course if drugs are legal
they<BR>
would be even more regulated.  There would be government regulations on
drug<BR>
imports, drug purity, drug types, drug farms, and security and taxes and<BR>
sales and age limits.  The cost of tobacco and alcohol warn us that tax<BR>
revenues can never make up enough to pay their way.  The increased health<BR>
care costs would hurt us all.  Most police time is spent on petty crime
and<BR>
disturbances and if drugs are cheaper and easier to get, there will be far<BR>
more demands on police time.  Drug testing of drivers and workers also would<BR>
have to be expanded and our civil rights would diminish.<BR>
<BR>
Lastly, you state that you believe that drugs are a personal choice and
many<BR>
legalization advocates hold that viewpoint as well.  We greatly respect<BR>
individual liberty and personal freedom.  We respect it for the person who<BR>
does not use drugs as well.  It is our view that drugs do not only affect
the<BR>
person that is using them and, like other hazardous substances, they are
a<BR>
danger to innocent non-users.  <BR>
<BR>
The most hideous violence in society is perpetrated against children by<BR>
adults through child abuse and neglect.  If drugs were legal, cheaper, and<BR>
easier to get, would there be more crack addicted babies born, or fewer?<BR>
 With more fathers and mothers stoned, more often, would there be less child<BR>
abuse, or more?  In some cities over 80% of child abuse killings are related<BR>
to the use of cocaine, yet only 2-3% of adults use cocaine regularly.<BR>
<BR>
When a person uses drugs they use them to get intoxicated and once the brain<BR>
is impaired people do not make good decisions about driving, child care,
or<BR>
workplace safety.  It is our ability to reason and to think clearly that<BR>
enables us to make choices freely.  All of society is at risk from drug
use,<BR>
not just the user.  Among big rig truckers killed in accidents, as many
had<BR>
pot in their system as had alcohol, even though there are five times as
many<BR>
regular drinkers.  If pot were legal, even more accidents would occur. 
Have<BR>
you ever been to a high school or public event and seen an intoxicated person<BR>
annoy others or start fights.  That is an intrusion on your rights caused
by<BR>
intoxicating drugs.  Legalization will not improve the situation.<BR>
<BR>
Most of us in Drug Watch have seen the damage drugs cause firsthand.  Some<BR>
have wept with mothers who have lost their son or daughter to addiction
or to<BR>
drug related accidents.  Some have gone through it with their own children.<BR>
 Some have treated the abused children of addicts.  Some have tried to patch<BR>
up the broken bones and bodies in emergency rooms.  Some have watched healthy<BR>
happy teens withdraw into bitter rebellion and loneliness.  Some have seen<BR>
drugs steal the best and brightest minds.  Some have helped others work<BR>
through the family, financial, and legal wreckage.  Some regularly visit
the<BR>
gravestones of people they loved dearly.<BR>
<BR>
None of us can imagine what problems legalizing drugs can ever solve and
how<BR>
it would benefit children.  None of us have ever seen someone become a better<BR>
person by taking mind numbing intoxicants.  None of us plan to let that<BR>
happen while we are alive.<BR>
<BR>
I am very happy that you wrote and that you want to hear what &quot;our&quot;
side has<BR>
to say about this issue.  I am most pleased that you do not use drugs and
I<BR>
hope that you never do.  They have nothing to offer.  You have been hit
with<BR>
a lot of propaganda from the pro-drug legalization side.  MTV, Rolling Stone,<BR>
music bands, and mass media have worked hard to promote this legalization<BR>
idea.  In fact, recently one billionaire gave over $15 million to the<BR>
legalization cause.  I hope that you can sift through the myths and the
facts<BR>
on this issue.  It seems that many of the legalizers are a bit older than
I<BR>
am and white and from fairly wealthy homes.  They only relate drugs to their<BR>
60's experience or their ivy league college times and from that perspective<BR>
they may sound convincing.  <BR>
<BR>
Drug Watch believes that we have to protect the poor, as well as the rich,<BR>
and people of all races and gender. Our focus should be on the needs of<BR>
children - not the desires of a few selfish adults.  People are more<BR>
important than ideas and theories.  Our experience in life teaches us that<BR>
drug legalization is not good for people.<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
Kindest regards,<BR>
