<H2>Eco-Escuela de Espa&ntildeol</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>
The Eco-Escuela de Espa&ntildeol is an ecologically oriented Spanish language school in northern Guatemala.  The school offers students a unique educational experience through its combination of intensive language instruction and hands-on environmental education.  The mission of the school is to immerse students in the language, culture, and ecology of the Pet&eacute;n region of Guatemala, an area renowned for its tropical forest and ancient Maya ruins.

<P>
<b>Spanish Instruction</b>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/LOGOS/Logoesc.gif" ALT="Logoesc.gif - 4.4 K" WIDTH=257 HEIGHT=222 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>One-on-one Spanish classes are tailored to meet the needs of every student - beginner, intermediate, or advanced.  Highly qualified local teachers work with each student at her or his own pace to develop and strengthen both conversational and written skills.  Ecological issues are integrated into daily class discussions and activities.
<P>

<B>Homestays</B>
<P>
Living with a local family is an essential part of the Eco-Escuela experience.  In addition to daily language interaction outside the classroom, homestays also provide a unique opportunity to participate in the lives and customs of the people of San Andr&eacute;s.  Accommodations are simple but comfortable.
<P>

<B>San Andr&eacute;s, Guatemala</B>
<P>
The school is situated in the community of San Andr&eacute;s, on beautiful Lake Pet&eacute;n Itz&aacute;.  Just adjacent is the Maya Biosphere Reserve, a four million acre protected area spanning northern Guatemala's <A HREF="peten.htm">Pet&eacute;n region</A> - the largest protected tropical forest reserve in Central America.  This lowland tropical forest is home to a wealth of plant and animal diversity including species such as jaguars, tapirs, monkeys and hundreds of exotic birds.
<P>
