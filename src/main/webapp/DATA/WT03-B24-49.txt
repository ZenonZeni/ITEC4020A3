<B>501 Discrete and Logical Structures for Information Systems (3:3:0).</B> 
Prerequisites: 6 credits of undergraduate mathematics.  Study of discrete and logical
structures for information systems analysis and design including basic set theory
and proof techniques, propositional and predicate logic, Boolean algebras and
lattices, trees and graphs, finite state machines, formal languages and their
relation to automata, computability and computational complexity, formal
semantics-operational, axiomatic and denotational approaches.
<P>
<B>515 Computer Organization (3:3:0).</B>  Prerequisites:  Undergraduate courses or
equivalent knowledge in structured programming in a high-level language.  Computer
hardware organization:  arithmetic and logical operations; combinational and
sequential logic; machine representation of numbers, characters, and
instructions; addressing techniques; microprogramming; reduced instruction set
computers.  Symbolic assembly language.  Interrupts and input/output
organization.
