<h1>Alternative Fuel Vehicles</h1>
<p>
<p>
Alternative fuels include ethanol, methanol, natural gas, liquefied 
petroleum
gas, hydrogen, electricity, and any other fuel or energy source that is 
not
produced from petroleum. Alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) can be 
passenger cars
or trucks (light-duty vehicles), heavy-duty trucks, or buses that have 
been
designed or modified to operate on alternative fuels.<p>
<p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
Only 13% market penetration for AFVs in the year 2010 could save 3.5 
quads of
energy by that year. This equals about 15% of the total energy used by 
the
transportation sector or the total amount of energy used by Illinois.<p>
Widespread AFV use will reduce atmospheric pollutants, stimulate job 
creation,
and strengthen domestic energy security.<p>
Federal tests showed that AFVs compare favorably to conventional vehicles 
in
terms of fuel economy and generally produce fewer harmful emissions than
gasoline counterparts.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
About 275,000 AFVs were running on American roads at the end of 1993; 
these are
nearly all federal or private fleet vehicles.<p>
Most AFVs are powered by liquefied petroleum gas, followed by compressed
natural gas, and next, by a blend of 85% gasoline and 15% methanol, also 
known
as M85.<p>
<p>
Through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the federal government is 
leading
the drive to increase the number of AFVs on road.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use</h2>
The federal Energy Information Administration projects that there will be 
2.5
million AFVs on the nation's highways by 2010.<p>
AFV use is continuing to increase; for example, an executive order signed 
by
President Clinton in 1993 requires that 75% of the vehicles acquired by 
the
federal fleet by 1999 be AFVs.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
An important piece of legislation, <b><i>The Alternative Motor Fuels Act 
of
1988</i></b>, is spurring America's adoption of AFVs.<p>
This legislation directed DOE to work with other agencies to promote the
development and widespread use of alternative fuels, thus propelling AFVs

toward commercial application and consumer acceptance.<p>
Another crucial piece of federal legislation, <b><i>The Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990</i></b>, requires modified gasoline content and 
established
stricter emissions regulations for vehicles in designated ozone 
nonattainment
regions of the country.<p>
<p>
<b><i>The Energy Policy Act of 1992</i></b> requires that federal, state, 
and
local governments, alternative fuel providers, and private fleets buy 
AFVs in
increasing percentages over time. This act also includes tax incentives 
for
buying AFVs and developing retail service stations. <p>
<p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
DOE is working on infrastructure development, cost reduction, and vehicle 
range
improvements to achieve consumer acceptance.<p>
<p>
<h2>DOE Projects and Initiatives</h2>
The <b><i>Clean Cities Program</i></b>: Aims to establish a 
self-sustaining AFV
infrastructure by involving federal, state, and local governments; fuel
suppliers; vehicle manufacturers; consumers; fleet managers; utilities; 
and
environmental groups.<p>

The <b><i>California Pilot Program</i></b>: Sets nonmethane hydrocarbon
emission standards for California fleet vehicles beginning in model year 
1996.
California will have to acquire 150,000 "clean" vehicles by that year.<p>

The <b><i>Clean-Fuel Fleet Program</i></b>: Requires one-third of the
acquisitions by centrally fueled fleets to use clean fuels and meet more
stringent tailpipe standards by 1998.<p>
The National Alternative Fuels Hotline/Alternative Fuels Data Center:
Establishes a centralized hotline number for nationwide AFV information
(1-800-423-1DOE).<p>
