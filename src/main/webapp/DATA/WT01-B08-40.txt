<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Businessmen Against
Bolivian Membership Of Mercosur</font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&nbsp;LA PAZ. (MP).-</strong>
Businessmen from Argentina and Bolivia are complaining about
Mercosur in spite of the fact that Argentine President Carlos
Menem in his official visit to Bolivia, signed 18 agreements to
increase trade between both countries and ensure Bolivia'a
integration next January to Mercosur.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Argentine businessmen argue that Bolivia
will become a disloyal competitor if the country joins Mercosur
with a list of 1.200 protected goods. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Bolivians on the other hand complain that
Mercosur negotiators treat them &quot;<em>as if we were Asian
tigers when we're only the poorest country of the area</em>&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The Bolivian list of exceptions protects
1.200 sensible and ultra sensible products, &quot;<em>but that
umbrella could also become the gateway for many industrial goods
manufactured in third countries</em>&quot;, warns the Argentine Industry
Union.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Bolivian insist they have a right to be
considered a &quot;<em>less developed country</em>&quot; and
would rather postpone until next April integration to Mercosur.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Bolivia is expected to join Mercosur next
January on a similar &quot;<em>4 plus 1</em>&quot; Chilean
association, but still has to convince Brazil of the long list of
exceptions which will have a special tariff protection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Menem promised his Bolivian counterpart,
Sánchez de Losada strong lobbying in the Mercosur coming discussions
with Brazil, and in exchange Bolivia will include Argentina in
its mega project to sell natural gas to Brazil.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Another thorny issue of the
Argentin-Bolivian discussions was the illegal presence of over a
million Bolivians in Argentina, many of whom are discriminated
and exploited because they have no legal documents, while Argentina
complains they distort the local employment market.</font></p>
