<P>Toronto, Ontario, October 29, 1996 ... In response to erroneous press articles regarding TVX Gold Inc.'s Kassandra Project in Greece carried in the October 29 editions of the Financial Times of London and The Financial Post of Toronto, TVX is making the following statement to clarify the current situation.  

<P>TVX announced on October 22, 1996 that the blockade that had been preventing full access to the Olympias mine at its wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas', Kassandra project in Greece had been lifted.  Certain of the communities and residents in the area of the Olympias mine had been blocking full access to the Olympias operations because of their concerns about mining in the area.  As a result of negotiations between senior Greek Government representatives and representatives of the said communities, the blockade was lifted.  TVX Hellas immediately commenced moving materials and equipment into the site to allow the planned redevelopment and reopening of the mine and mill and to complete the planning for the construction of a gold recovery plant.  Since that time, no "further delays" have been experienced.  On the contrary, TVX Hellas has enjoyed full access to the Olympias mine and mill facility and the mobilization of equipment and material has been expedited.  

<P>The Kassandra Mines property, which encompasses approximately 314 square kilometres, was studied by the responsible archeological authorities having jurisdiction at the time that the former owners were considering building a gold plant in the late 1980's and a formal determination was made at that time by the Ministry of Culture stating that the Kassandra site was not of archeological significance.  There has been no "discovery of an ancient city" and no official statements of the Archeological Department of the Ministry of Culture have been made to this effect.

<P>After discussions with the local archeological authority, TVX Hellas allowed a general surface survey of the property to be made by representatives of the 16th Archeological Department of Greece.  "The archeological service neither sought nor obtained a court order".  The proposed site of the gold extraction plant has not yet been determined and will not be determined until after the appropriate studies and permit applications are completed.  It would, therefore, be impossible to say that anything of archeological significance was "discovered on the proposed site".

<P>There is significant archeological interest in the Chalkidiki region, most specifically the site known locally as "Ancient Stagira", which is believed to be the site of the birth place of the philosopher Aristotle.  The site, where extensive archeological work continues, is not located within the Kassandra mining property and is not affected in any way by the mining that has been carried on in the Stratoni and Olympias areas for in excess of 20 years.  The "Ancient Stagira" site is located on the Aegean Sea, south of the village of Olympiada, north of the town of Stratoni, approximately eight kilometres by road from the Olympias mine.  The refurbishment of the existing Olympias mine and mill and the development of a gold plant will be done in accordance with the applicable Greek laws which govern all appropriate criteria, including engineering, construction, environmental and others.  If any antiquities are found in the course of any such work, there are specific legal procedures in place in Greece which would pertain.  Furthermore, the refurbishment and development of the existing Kassandra mine assets can hardly be described as a "greenfield project".  

<P>TVX Hellas and TVX Gold have enjoyed the assistance and support of the Government of Greece in resolving the situation at Kassandra and continue to work with the relevant Government ministries.  As part of its discussion with the concerned communities, the Government did not "announce an independent inquiry into the TVX concession area".  What was agreed was that an independent mining research firm would be involved in evaluating the potential site locations for the gold plant and would make recommendations.  This would be the normal procedure that TVX would undertake in any event.    

<P>TVX regrets that these erroneous articles, which have caused confusion in the marketplace, have detracted from the excellent progress currently being made in Greece.
