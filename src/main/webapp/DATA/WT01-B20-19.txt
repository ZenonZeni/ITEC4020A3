<CENTER><B>Canadian Hemp Activist, Businessman Busted By Vancouver Police</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 4, Vancouver, Canada:</B>&nbsp;  Police have raided the <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> store in Vancouver, British Columbia, and are charging the store's owner, vocal hemp activist Marc Emery, and three employees with selling marijuana seeds.&nbsp;  Emery had been selling marijuana seeds, along with hemp products and literature, from his retail store for the last 19 months in open defiance of the law.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Emery was recently featured in a front page article of the Wall Street Journal where he boasted to have sold "130,000 seeds" this year alone.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The raid took place at approximately 1 p.m. and law enforcement officials seized seeds and drug paraphernalia such as pipes, bongs, and mushroom grow kits.&nbsp;  A large Budget Rent-a-truck was parked outside to help the police move Hemp BC's wide assortment of products.&nbsp;  Emery and three employees were taken away in handcuffs and all four activists are being charged with trafficking marijuana seeds and selling instruments and 
paraphernalia for illicit drug use.&nbsp;  If found guilty of both charges, all four could face each life imprisonment and fines of $100,000.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Police Constable Anne Drennan states that the <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> bust is the first time in Vancouver history that trafficking charges have been filed against individuals for selling marijuana seeds.&nbsp;  Drennan further added that she expects Emery -- a self-proclaimed libertarian who has previously served time in jail for opening his bookstore on Sunday in disobedience of Ontario's blue laws -- to conduct a very public court challenge.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Both Emery and the three <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> employees were released Friday on their own recognizance.&nbsp;  A preliminary hearing has been set for February 8, 1996.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Dana Larsen, editor of the magazine <I>Cannabis Canada</I>, reports 
that the <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> retail storefront continues to remain open for business in spite of last Thursday's raid.&nbsp;  "We will be selling pipes, bongs, and seeds as per usual, although we might be understocked for a day or two," he says.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information on <a href="http://www.hempbc.com/Overview.html">Hemp BC</a> or Marc Emery's arrest, please contact Hemp BC @ (800) 330-HEMP.</I>

<CENTER><B>American Farm Bureau Supports Industrial Hemp Research</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 11, 1995, Reno, Nevada:</B>&nbsp;  The American Farm Bureau Federation, the largest farming organization in the United States, passed a resolution at its annual convention calling for research that could lead to the re-introduction of hemp into the American farm economy.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The resolution, adopted by a unanimous vote of the 51 state presidents and all 300 voting delegates, reads: "We recommend that [the] American Farm Bureau Federation encourage research into the viability and economic potential of industrial hemp production in the United States.&nbsp;  We further recommend that such research includes planting test plots in the United States using modern agricultural techniques."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Often described as "marijuana's misunderstood cousin," industrial hemp is from the same plant species that produces marijuana.&nbsp;  Unlike marijuana, however, industrial hemp has only minute amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient that gives marijuana its euphoric properties.&nbsp;  Industrial hemp is currently grown legally 
throughout much of Europe and Asia and is being cultivated in test plots in Australia and Canada.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Andrew Graves, incoming president of the Fayette County chapter of the Kentucky Farm Bureau and vice-president of the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative Association, introduced the resolution at the convention.&nbsp;  "What we are asking for is research to determine whether industrial hemp can once again become a profitable agricultural commodity for American farmers 
just as it is for farmers around the world," Graves said in his presentation.&nbsp;  "Where would agriculture be without research?"
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a separate resolution, the AFB also voted to affirm its policy in support of government efforts to eradicate illegal drugs, including marijuana.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information on the Kentucky Hemp Growers Cooperative Association, please contact Andrew Graves @ (606) 293-0579 or write to P.O. Box 8395, Lexington, KY 40533.&nbsp;  The American Farm Bureau Federation may be contacted @ (202) 484-3600.</I>

<CENTER><B>U.S. Representative Criticizes <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a> Protest Rally</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 3, 1996, Washington, DC:</B>&nbsp;  In response to a December 1 rally held outside the offices of Boston radio station WBCN to 
the protest the airplay of the NORML benefit CD <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>, U.S. 
Representative Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has issued a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno both condemning the actions of rally organizers, the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and requesting an inquiry into whether federal law enforcement officials were involved.  
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Like many others who have voiced their disapproval over the actions of the G.A.A.D. (i.e., National Writers Union, Boston Coalition for Freedom of Expression, Mass/Cann, etc.), Frank is highly critical of the actions of a Drug Enforcement Administration official who allegedly took an active role in the protest.&nbsp;  "It does not seem to me at all appropriate for a 
federal law enforcement agent to accompany an individual [G.A.A.D. Executive Director Georgette Watson] who is making a demand that a media outlet cease broadcasting a particular album, no matter how ... ill-advised you, I and the DEA might find it to be," Frank writes.&nbsp;  "This [sort of conduct] puts the federal government in the position of lending official support to an interference with freedom of expression. ..."
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... [Therefore,] if in fact a DEA agent accompanied Ms. Watson and lent support by his ... presence to her demand that the radio station stop playing [the <a href="http://www.ecolution.com/hempi.html">Hempilation</a>] CD, [then] that is a wholly inappropriate action for a federal law enforcement official ... and I ask that you look into it and make clear that this is not the sort of thing that should happen."

<CENTER><B>College Freshman Survey Shows Renewed Support For Marijuana Legalization</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 8, 1996:</B>&nbsp;  Results from an annual survey of college freshmen indicates that support for marijuana legalization 
currently stands at a 15-year high.&nbsp;  Nearly 34 percent of the 
respondents favored the legalization of cannabis, The Associated Press reported.&nbsp;  This figure was double the 17 percent who held that view in 1989.

<CENTER><B>Bipartisan Committee Set To Analyze Violent Crime In America; Issues First Report</B></CENTER>

<P><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><B>January 5, 1996, Washington, DC:</B>&nbsp;  The bipartisan committee, Council on Crime in America, held a press conference to issue its debut report on the state of violent crime in America.&nbsp;  The task 
force is co-chaired by former Drug Czar William Bennett and former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The committee's first report is "descriptive" rather than "prescriptive" and reveals that violent crime today still remains at a historic high.&nbsp;  "This study paints a realistic and sobering picture of violent crime in America," says Bennett.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Future reports and conferences will be aimed at addressing potential solutions to America's violent crime problem, the bipartisan task force announced.&nbsp;  One of the problems that the bipartisan commission intends to address is the notion that America's current criminal justice system is simply a "revolving door" for career offenders.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">"We are hear to underscore the American people's perception on violent crime," Bennett concluded.
<BR><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><I>For more information or for a copy of the report, "The State of Violent Crime In America," please contact Lara Stead by fax @ (202) 822-8328.</I>
