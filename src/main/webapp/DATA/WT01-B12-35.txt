 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BEAUTIFUL IMAGE </H2>

<P>  SHAPE PLUS can help you achieve the "beautiful image" you have always desired. Combined with other Life Plus products, a sensible diet and a reasonable amount of exercise, SHAPE PLUS is helping thousands lose weight. Most importantly, they are keeping it off. It was developed by a biochemist who is well known for his understanding of lipid (fat) metabolism.  After much testing,  Life  Plus  decided  this  effective  herbal combination would make an exciting product to serve as an adjunct for individuals wanting to take a rational approach to weight management, not just a quick artificial, fad program.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW IT WORKS</H2>
<P>  SHAPE PLUS contains twenty-three different herbs and herbal extracts that contain higher levels of polyphenolic compounds.  It also contains 200 mcg of Chromium in the form of Chromium Picolinate. The polyphenols in these herbs are tannin related compounds and are somewhat astringent.  They have a natural appetite suppression action and help to reduce hunger if taken soon enough before hunger begins.</P>
<P>  These polyphenols are now becoming more well known in the literature and are generally considered to be some of the phytochemicals responsible for many health processes in the body.   They have a natural cleansing effect on the whole body and help the body detoxify as it is cleansed during weight loss.</P>
 <P> The herbs in SHAPE PLUS can reduce the amount of dietary fat absorbed into our bodies, thereby reducing calorie uptake from fat. They tie up fats naturally in the digestive tract making them less susceptible to digestion. The net result is that they are eliminated rather than absorbed.  They also help move food through the digestive tract at a more rapid pace, so that the extra "empty calories" do not linger and become absorbed.</P>
<P>  When fewer calories are absorbed, the body uses up its own fat for energy.   The natural appetite control provided by SHAPE PLUS is a blessing to those trying to control their eating habits.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CHROMIUM PICOLINATE</H2>
<P>  The Chromium Picolinate in SHAPE PLUS reduces the craving for sweets and helps the body maintain proper blood sugar levels. The typical energy ups and downs normally associated with dieting are greatly reduced. Not only individuals attempting to lose weight, but body builders and weight lifters take Chromium Picolinate as it supports the conversion of fat to lean body tissue. By having a greater percentage of lean body tissue to fat tissue, your metabolic consumption of calories is higher and it is easier to "burn more calories" every minute of every day. This, of course, makes it easier to keep those excess pounds off forever.</P>
<P>  The most well liked feature of  SHAPE PLUS is that it naturally reduces appetite. SHAPE PLUS can be taken anytime during the day. However, it must be taken at mealtime or when food is eaten to obtain its full benefit. People routinely loose five or more pounds per month.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROGRAMS</H2>
<P>  SHAPE PLUS can be used by itself or as part of any weight program.  When used as part of a total weight management, the best results are obtained. Always limit fats, processed foods and refined carbohydrates.   Use common sense when eating, and it will be easier to avoid unwanted calories while taking SHAPE PLUS.</P>
<P>  The ideal weight management program is to eat sensibly and take SHAPE PLUS with four other synergistic   Life   Plus   products, <A HREF="mendo.htm">  ENDOCRYN DHEA</A>, <A HREF="msupt.htm">SUPPORT TABS</A>, <A HREF="mpromax.htm">PRO-MAX</A> and <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A>. Take one heaping teaspoonful of COLODYNE in juice each morning, one or two ENDOCRYN DHEA tablets three times a day with meals, three SUPPORT TABS twice a day, and replace one or two meals a day with a PRO-MAX shake. Only eat fruits and vegetables between meals.

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  SHAPE PLUS is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them. </P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE SHAPE PLUS</H2>
<P>  It is best to take SHAPE PLUS between 15 and 30 minutes before each meal. If you get hungry, take it. Between two and four tablets are usually taken before meals and one with light snacks. Be consistent and take SHAPE PLUS every time you eat. Carry some tablets with you at all times, so that you have them whenever you decide to snack or "eat out".</P>
