<CITE>The following information came from Environment Canada's A 
      Primer on Environmental Citizenship </A>.</H5>
        <I>Despite progress in recent years, acid rain remains a significant 
        environmental and economic concern for many regions of Canada.  
        This section explains what acid rain is, where it comes from, and 
        what it's effects are.

        <I> Q3.49</I>
         <STRONG>What causes acid
         deposition?</STRONG>
         <P>
         Acid deposition - commonly called
         acid rain - is caused by emissions
         of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen
         oxides. Although natural sources
         of sulphur oxides and nitrogen
         oxides do exist, more than 90%
         of the sulphur and 95% of the
         nitrogen emissions occurring in
         eastern North America are of
         human origin. These primary
         air pollutants arise from the use
         of coal in the production of
         electricity, from base-metal
         smelting, and from fuel combustion in vehicles. Once released
         into the atmosphere, they can be
         converted chemically into such
         secondary pollutants as nitric
         
         acid and sulfuric acid, both of
         which dissolve easily in water.
         The resulting acidic water
         droplets can be carried long
         distances by prevailing winds,
         returning to Earth as acid rain,
         snow, or fog.
    <P><HR>     
        <I> Q 3.50</I>
         <STRONG>Is acid deposition always
         wet?</STRONG>
         <P>
         No. The acids can be transformed
         chemically into sulphur dioxide
         gas or into sulphur and nitrogen
         salts. In this form they are deposited 'dry', causing the same
         damage as when they land dissolved in rain or snow. In this
         form they can also do internal
         damage to plants as they are
         taken up from the soil.

       About 40% of nitrogen oxides come from transportation
         (cars, trucks, buses, trains), about 25% from thermoelectric
         generating stations, and the balance from other industrial,
         commercial, and residential combustion processes.
	 </I>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.51</I>
<STRONG> Is natural precipitation acidic?</STRONG>
<P>
Yes. Water solutions vary in their degree of acidity. If pure water is defined as neutral,  baking soda solutions are basic (alkaline) and household ammonia is very basic (very alkaline).  On the other side of this scale there are ascending degrees of acidity; milk is slightly acidic, tomato juice is slightly more acidic, vinegar is mediumly acidic, lemon juice is still more acidic, and battery acid is extremely acidic.
If there were no pollution at all, normal rainwater would fall on the acid side of this scale, not the alkaline side. Normal rainwater is less acidic than tomato juice, but more acidic than milk. What pollution does is cause the acidity of rain to increase. In some areas of Canada, rain can be as acidic as vinegar or lemon juice.
<P>
<HR>
<I>Q 3.52</I>
<STRONG>If rain is naturally acidic, why does it matter if pollution makes it more acidic?</STRONG>
<P>
The problem is one of balance; nature depends upon balance. Normal precipitation reacts with alkaline chemicals - derived from the region's bedrock and found in the air, soils, lakes, and streams - and is thereby neutralized.
However, if precipitation is more highly acidic, then acid-buffering chemicals can eventually become depleted.  In this case, the buffering effect will no longer occur, and nature's ability to maintain balance will have been destroyed. 
<P>
<HR>
<I>Q 3.53</I>
<STRONG>Do all regions have the same acid-neutralizing capacity?</STRONG>
<P>
No. Different types of bedrock contain variable amounts of contain variable amounts of alkaline chemicals. Regions with bedrock containing less alkali have a lower capacity for reducing acidity, and thus are more sensitive to acid deposition.
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.54</I>
<STRONG>What happens when this buffering effect is disrupted </STRONG>
<P>
When the environment cannot neutralize acid rain, damage occurs to forests, crops, lakes,
and fish. Toxic metals such as copper and lead can also be leached from water pipes into drinking water.
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.55</I>
<P>
<STRONG>How does acid deposition affect aquatic ecosystems?</STRONG>
<P>
The interactions between living organisms and the chemistry of their aquatic habitats are extremely complex. If the number of one species or group of species changes in response to acidification, then the ecosystem of the entire water body is likely to be affected through the predator-prey relationships of the food web. At first, the effects of acid deposition may be almost imperceptible, but as acidity increases, more and more species of plants and animals decline or disappear.
<P><UL>
<LI> As the water pH approaches 6.0, crustaceans, insects, and some plankton species begin to disappear.
<BR><LI> As pH approaches 5.0, major changes in the makeup of the plankton community occur, less desirable species of mosses and plankton may begin to invade, and the progressive loss of some fish populations is likely, with the more highly valued species being generally the least tolerant of acidity.
<BR><LI> Below pH of 5.0, the water is largely devoid of fish, the bottom is covered with undecayed material, and the nearshore areas may be dominated by mosses.
<BR><LI> Terrestrial animals dependent on aquatic ecosystems are also affected. Waterfowl, for example, depend on aquatic organisms for nourishment and nutrients. As these food sources are reduced or eliminated, the quality of habitat declines and the reproductive
success of the birds is affected.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.56</I>
<STRONG>How does acid deposition affect terrestrial plant life?</STRONG>
<P>
Both natural vegetation and crops can be affected.
<P><UL>
<LI> It can alter the protective waxy surface of leaves, lowering disease resistance.
<BR><LI> It may inhibit plant germination and reproduction.
<BR><LI> It accelerates soil weathering and removal of nutrients.
<BR><LI> It makes some toxic elements, such as aluminum, more soluble. High aluminum concentrations in soil can prevent the uptake and use of nutrients by plants.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.57</I>
<STRONG>How does acid deposition affect animal life?</STRONG>
<P>
The effects on terrestrial wildlife are hard to assess. As a result of pollution-induced alteration of habitat or food resources, acid deposition may cause population decline through stress (because of decreases in available resources) and lower reproductive
success.
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.58</I>
<STRONG>What are the socioeconomic consequences of acidification?</STRONG>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Lower productivity  in fisheries, forestry, and agriculture translates to lower profits and fewer jobs for some of Canada's important industries.
<BR><LI> Acid deposition causes accelerated corrosion, fracturing, and discoloration of buildings,
structures, and monuments.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.59</I>
<STRONG>How does acid deposition affect human health?</STRONG>
<P><UL>
<LI> We eat food, drink water, and breathe air that has come in contact with acid deposition.
<LI> Canadian and U.S. studies indicate that there is a link between this pollution and
respirator problems in sensitive populations such as children and asthmatics.
<LI> Acid deposition can increase the levels of toxic metals such as aluminum, copper, and mercury in untreated drinking water supplies.

<I>It has been estimated that acid rain causes $1 billion worth of damage in Canada every year. Thousands of lakes have been damaged; a large part of the salmon habitat in the Maritimes has been lost; a significant proportion of eastern Canada's forests has been
affected; and considerable damage to buildings and monuments has been documented.
<P>
The Canadian Council of Resource and Environment Ministers in established 20 kg/hectare per year as the target for Canadian sulphur dioxide loading. In eastern Canada, 96% of the land with high capability for forestry is subject to acidic deposition
in excess of 20 kg/ha per year. In recent years, important instances of dieback and
declines in growth rate have been noted in sugar maple groves in parts of Canada that receive high levels of these and other air pollutants, such as ozone. Significant growth declines in northern Ontario forests, most notable over the past 30 years, coincide with a period of rapidly increasing industrialization and urbanization across much of  the province.

<I>More than 80% of all Canadians live in areas with high acid rain-related pollution levels.
</I>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<I>Q 3.60</I>
<STRONG>Is acid deposition occurring to the same extent across Canada?</STRONG>
<P>
No. Sulphur emissions tend to be concentrated in relatively few locations, while the sources of nitrogen emissions are widely distributed; however, where they are deposited depends on more than just where they are produced. Airborne acidic pollutants are often transported by large scale weather systems thousands of kilometres from their point of
origin before being deposited. In eastern North America, weather systems generally travel
from southwest to northeast. Thus, pollutants emitted from sources in the industrial
heartland of the midwestern states and central Canada regularly fall on the more rural
and comparatively pristine areas of the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada.
