SONY TO DEMONSTRATE DOLBY AC-3 IN LAS VEGAS FOR FIRST TIME

     Growing Dolby AC-3 bandwagon will receive significant new
member at this week's Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show (CES)
when Sony for first time will demonstrate working prototype of
Dolby AC-3 processor.

     Sony plans demonstrations of working AC-3 mockup at Bally's
Hotel suite, while "cosmetic" nonworking prototype is likely to be
displayed at Las Vegas Convention Center room where company is
mounting its main exhibit, Hi-Fi Vp Vic Pacor said.  Bally's
demonstration will be of prototype processor using discrete digital
processing, meshed with existing high-end "M"-series speakers sold
under ES franchise, including new SS-M1CN center-channel speaker,
due for spring delivery at $500 list.  Pacor said Sony will bill
AC-3 showings as "technology demonstration only," indicating that
company "is not yet prepared" to discuss specific marketing plans. 
He said additional specifics on AC-3 launch could be available in
spring, when Sony has scheduled series of annual "zone" sales
meetings.

     Sony's first AC-3 product is likely to be outboard processor
rather than integrated receiver, Pacor said.  Product delivery is
expected to "coincide" with launch of its first DVD players, he
said.  Commitment to show AC-3 in Las Vegas was hastened by
agreement last month designating that as mandatory DVD audio system
in NTSC markets and as optional system in PAL and SECAM territories
(AW Dec 11 p1).  Sony's AC-3 support is "a follow-through on our
commitment to take a leadership position on DVD," Pacor said.  He
indicated that if AC-3 had been confined to audio system for
laserdisc, "we probably wouldn't have been interested."

     Statement of Sony support gives important boost to fortunes of
AC-3, although Dolby technology has been on significant momentum
roll since system was unveiled by Denon, Pioneer and others at Las
Vegas show 2 years ago.  Statement seemed to quash speculation that
Sony would develop home adaptation of Sony Dynamic Digital Sound
(SDDS) system now competing with AC-3 and Digital Theater Systems
(DTS) technologies in theatrical community.

     Notwithstanding Sony plans, AC-3 would have been significant
story anyway at Las Vegas show, where "AC-3-ready" will be
ubiquitous buzz term reminiscent of "digital-ready" marketing label
that greeted CD bandwagon launch decade ago.  Typifying others,
Definitive Technology plans demonstration of "AC-3-ready"
PowerField subwoofer, 125-w, 12" box available separately at $549
and marketed as part of BP 2002 home theater speaker system.  Also
following suit is Phase Technology, which plans 5-model
"AC-3-compatible speaker system" for home theater at $500.

     Wide range of AC-3 is promised throughout CES, including
Technics, which said it will join growing roster of companies
planning audiovideo receivers combining AC-3 with THX processing. 
However, specifics on Technics product weren't available by our
deadline.  Harman Kardon said it will "preview" AC-303 outboard
processor for AC-3, which is set for late-spring delivery at $799
list.  "The availability of program sources with full 5.1-channel
discrete audio is one of the most exciting developments in home
theater in recent years," Harman Kardon Pres. Chris Stevens said.

     As for DVD movement itself, number of player prototypes
promised by primary and secondary vendors could fill own
independent trade show.  With unified DVD specifications in place,
Las Vegas show marks unofficial start of competitive DVD derby,
even though first products won't reach store shelves for at least
9 months.

     Companies not showing DVD players at Las Vegas seem exception,
not rule.  Scarcer still are those not promising DVD leadership
positions or not pledging to be involved in first round of product
deliveries.  While much of DVD news will be generated on main show
floor, highlight will be series of consecutively timed DVD news
conferences planned for eve of show Jan. 4 (Thurs.) by Pioneer,
Sony, Thomson, Toshiba.  At our deadline, Pioneer and Sony were
close-mouthed as to what they planned for announcements later this
week.  However, Thomson and Toshiba have taken more aggressive
postures, promising to lay out DVD product and promotional
specifics.

     Thomson news conference invitations promised DVD marketing
announcements under RCA, GE and ProScan labels, as well as
unspecified software component.  Retailers that met with Thomson
officials last month said company has drafted definite plans on how
it wants to bring DVD to market, based on philosophy that first
hardware dealers will be encouraged to carry software titles. 
Retailers told us Thomson seemed poised to announce specific ways
of helping retailers market DVD software, but Dec. meetings
produced few specifics.  Other expected highlight of Thomson
announcements will come when it identifies "major Japanese partner"
with which it says it has struck multiproduct OEM agreement on
which company is basing pledge to market first-generation DVD
player at $499 (AW Dec 18 p4).

     Sanyo said it developed laser pickup capable of reading DVDs

     Sanyo said it developed laser pickup capable of reading DVDs
and conventional CDs.  Dual-use red laser pickup, which will have
output power of 5 mw, will be built using DVD wavelength of 635
nanometers, one of 2 wavelengths specified in unified DVD format
announced Dec. 8.  Unlike existing dual-focus pickups requiring use
of 2 lenses, Sanyo device uses LCD shutter system to change
characteristic of laser needed for specific types of disc.  Sanyo
said LCD method makes possible smaller and more reliable pickup. 
Sample shipments of new pickup will start in March, Sanyo said.

FIRST EOSONE SPEAKERS DUE AT BEST BUY IN APRIL

     Full line of Eosone speakers is expected to reach Best Buy
store shelves on time in early April, said Arnie Nudell, pres.,
Genesis Technologies, Vail, Colo., which is working with Polk Audio
on project (AW June 12 p1).

     Eosone products will be exclusive to Best Buy in U.S., but
also will be marketed outside country through international
distributors.  Nudell said Eosone goods will be produced at Polk
factories in Baltimore and San Diego.   Genesis and Polk executives
originally had planned to discuss specifics of Eosone project at
this week's Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show as means of
generating publicity for line and attracting international
distribution.  But Nudell and new Polk Pres. James Herd said plan
was scrapped in favor of lower profile rollout.

     With few exceptions, Eosone line will include dipolar speakers
and will be marketed as ideal for home theater and music
applications, Nudell said.  Line includes 3 tower speakers that use
so-called "radiant surround field" technology.  Flagship model will
be called RSF-1000, $2,200 per pair, featuring own built-in 175-w
powered subwoofer.  Lower priced RSF-600 and RSF-400 towers won't
be self-powered, Nudell said.  Two separate powered subwoofers are
planned for Eosone line, 12" model with built-in 150-w amplifier,
10" variation with 100-w.  There's also molded satellite speaker
system called "the Egg" and RSC-300 center-channel speaker.

     Dedicated rear-surround speakers are among few Eosone models
not to have dipolar design, partly because they're intended to mesh
with new Dolby AC-3 system, Nudell said.  He said all Eosone
drivers will have been "designed from scratch," not pulled from
shelf.  Line is aimed for maximum mix-and-match flexibility for
Best Buy customers interested in assembling high-end home theater
speaker package, Nudell said.

     Announcements last spring publicizing Eosone collaboration
between Polk and Genesis said Eosone line would be aimed at "an
upscale buyer" with "design attributes spun off from the Genesis
line of high-end loudspeakers."  Herd has said agreement to form
Eosone venture followed 2 years of talks between Polk and Best Buy
that started when companies agreed to explore ways of better
merchandising specialty audio speakers in Best Buy's
self-service-oriented "concept" stores.

     Polk executives have emphasized that its label won't appear on
Eosone products or marketing materials because of fear that that
would cause "an unnecessary distraction" from telling "very
powerful" Eosone brand story.  Fear of offending Polk specialty
accounts presumably also played key role in decision to divorce
Polk brand name from Eosone-labeled products.

     Meanwhile, "Eosone International" was one of 4 "strategic
business units" (SBUs) created by Polk in "major organizational
realignment" announced last month.  Other SBUs are for Polk Home
Entertainment Products, Automotive Products, Manufacturing. 
Automotive and home SBUs will be managed as "free-standing profit
centers," Polk said.  It said goals of restructuring are to
simplify organization to "clarify lines of authority and
accountability" and move "operational" decision-making further down
in organization.

EIA HAILS RECORD OCT. AUDIO SALES

     Double-digit increases in portable audio and components
overcame modest declines in systems and aftermarket autosound to
push factory audio sales to 13.9% increase, setting all-time record
for any previous month, EIA Market Research Dept. said.

     Overall Oct. shipments climbed nearly 14% to $1.066 billion
from year-earlier $935.73 million.  Record was set despite 2%
decline in systems to $216.42 million and 0.8% dip in aftermarket
car audio to $165.07 million.  Home theater boom continued to spark
once-beleagured components category, pushing shipments to 33.4%
gain to $258.18 million.  Portable audio shipments were up 20% in
Oct., posting monthly record sales total of $426.03 million
compared with year-earlier $354.91 million.

     For 10 months, total shipments topped $7-billion, rising 5.9%
to $7.03 billion.  Components led all categories with 13.8% sales
increase to $1.58 billion.  Other segments posted modest increases,
portable audio climbing 5.4% to $2.37 billion, aftermarket car
audio up 3.1% to $1.68 billion, systems rising 1.9% to $1.4
billion.

     Home theater boom prompted surge in audio components sales
that followed many months of consecutive declines.  EIA's Consumer
Electronics Mfrs. Assn. (CEMA) credited recovery to "white-hot
sales" of speakers and audiovideo receivers.  For Oct., receivers
rose 41% to $66.4 million, and surpassed $400 million for
Jan.-Oct., CEMA said.  Turntables also were pleasant Oct. surprise,
rising 27%, said CEMA, which didn't reveal actual sales estimate. 
Overall home speaker sales doubled in Oct. to $84.3 million,
spurred partly by fivefold rise in sales of surround sound speaker
packages for home theater, CEMA said.

     Trade group said 20% Oct. sales rise in portable audio to
record $426 million was category's best posting since April 1992,
when shipments rose 20.2% from year earlier to $156.74 million (AW
June 15/92 p5).  CEMA reported 6% rise in sales of boombox stereos
without CD to $28 million, while CD boomboxes posted "healthy" 17%
increase.

     Unspecified decline in rack system sales hurt overall systems
category in Oct., CEMA said, emphasizing that sales were up 2% for
10 months.  Pattern for most of 1995 repeated itself in Oct., with
strong sales of compact systems supporting category.  Aftermarket
car audio sales "held relatively steady" in Oct., CEMA said,
without mentioning 0.8% decline in month.  Shortfall came despite
11% rise in sales of car speakers, CEMA said.

     CEMA quoted Yamaha Mktg. Dir. Thomas Graham as saying that 33%
rise in Oct. components sales "gives further affirmation to the
escalating home theater ownership trend."  He said:  "Consumers are
learning that home theater is more than just video and requires
high-performance audiovideo receivers and components coupled with
quality speakers to truly recreate the movie theater experience."

     Here's EIA breakdown of factory audio sales for Oct. and
year's first 10 months:

DSS PRICES DECLINING AS COMPETITION HEATS UP

     As Digital Satellite System (DSS) pricing continues to drop
and competition increases, entry-level product appears poised to
dip below $300.

     Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) low-end RCA DSS system that
started 1995 at $699 was being advertised by year-end at $499 and
retailers said profit was in danger of drying up.  To combat
falling prices, some retailers are focusing on stepup RCA and Sony
DSS products that promise 20-25% profit margins, but slower sales. 
Overall, 1995 sales of RCA/GE and Sony DSS to dealers were expected
to surpass 1.5 million, while rival Primestar reported close to
million subscribers.

     "You've got some very big players coming into the business
[next year] and many aren't going to be able to take the high
road," Harvey Electronics Vp Franklin Karp said.  "I would say you
are 6 to 12 months away from a $199-$299 DSS."  Lower retail
tickets are expected as Daewoo, Sanyo, Samsung, Toshiba and Uniden
enter DSS race this year, with Uniden already indicating it may
price product in $499-$549 range.  In addition to DSS, Alphastar
and EchoStar plan to introduce own services -- latter partnering
with Philips to bring Magnavox product to CE retail.  Even
Primestar, which primarily has leased equipment to consumers, has
tested sales through multicable operator TCI.

     "We fully expect DSS to be discounted over time and we have 2
powerful weapons to deal with that method of distribution -- RCA
and GE," TCE Senior Vp James Meyer said.  GE DSS has been
advertised at $449 and even entry-level Sony model, which
originally had $749 suggested price tag, was featured in Wiz ad at
$648.

     Rapid decline in pricing doesn't seem to faze CE suppliers who
have said DSS may follow same path as cellular telephones where
hardware is offered to consumers virtually free and profits are
made on service.  EchoStar spokeswoman conceded as much, noting
that as hardware becomes low-margin product, programming could be
used to offset lost profits.  EchoStar hasn't formally released
pricing, but said in stock prospectus that hardware retails could
hit $500 with programming at $20.

     Alphastar has said it will avoid selling own brand at CE
retail, relying instead on combination of Amway, satellite
distributors and multilevel marketing.  Company signed agreement
with Samsung Electromechanics in Aug. to build integrated receiver
decoders (IRDs) and said it's seeking similar agreement with 2nd
supplier.  Both Samsung and 2nd supplier are expected to sell
branded product to CE dealers.  "I would think that for this
product the equipment would pass the cost curve much more rapidly
than the marketing cost of attracting a subscriber," said Alphastar
Pres.-CEO Murray Klippenstein, whose company plans to launch
120-channel service in first quarter with hardware packages at
$600-$700.  "When that happens it makes sense to give the box away
because the long-term value is in the subscription and the ongoing
revenue that comes from that subscription."

     But with so many satellite systems to choose from, future of
category hinges on manufacturers' ability to differentiate
products.  Many retailers already have said they won't give
category same amount of shelf space dedicated to other products
such as VCRs, meaning that suppliers will be battling for every
square inch.

     "The big question will be whether manufacturers can create
clear differences for consumers so they can make choices," Tops
Appliance City Senior Vp-Gen. Mdse. Mgr. Rick Jones said.  "When
you can't [tell differences] you end up dealing with a price issue
and end up with $499 satellite systems."

     DMX Inc. said it will mount its first official display at Las
Vegas Consumer Electronics Show to trumpet DMX Direct, 120-channel,
CD-quality direct-to-home digital music service delivered via
Ku-band satellite.  Company at previous Las Vegas shows has booked
off-site hospitality suites in unsuccessful bid to market DMX cable
decoders through traditional audio retailers.  Company described
DMX Direct as "the new high-end audio product" from DMX Inc.  It
said programming originates from banks of 300-disc CD changers from

     Top post at McIntosh Lab "is not just a job, it's a dream,"

     Top post at McIntosh Lab "is not just a job, it's a dream,"
company's newly appointed Pres. Thomas Shaeffer told us in
responding to our questions on why he gave up what he described as
successful industrial design and consulting business to become
successor to Ron Fone, now ADS pres. (AW Dec 18 p6).  Shaeffer said
he believes his "balance" of global engineering, marketing and
production skills made him top choice with Clarion management over
host of other candidates who reportedly vied for job.  He
sidestepped virtually all our questions on what factors spurred
Clarion managers to decide not to renew Fone's contract, but
praised Fone for making "a great contribution" to McIntosh during
his 4 years as pres., hailing him for "revitalizing" brand and
expanding breadth of McIntosh products into home theater arena.  As
for complaints from McIntosh dealers about product shortages --
some so severe that some merchants have dropped line -- Shaeffer
said "the reasons why we got here are less important" than strategy
for fixing problem.  But he declined specific comment on latter,
citing desire to discuss gripes with specific accounts at upcoming
Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show.  He did say keys to remedying
shortage problem include "strengthening our efficiency" in product
management and "increasing our national purchasing power."  He
promised no-nonsense approach in trying to win back disgruntled
dealers and said his personal "style" will be to "promise less and
deliver more."  He asked that critics judge his performance "by my
results and not my words."  Shaeffer ruled out expanding
distribution of McIntosh brand beyond its traditional
carriage-trade status.  Loyal dealers are like "an extended
family," he said.

9 months, income fell to $3.83 million (22 cents) from $11.08
million (63 cents) on 11.6% sales gain to $550.35 million. 
Same-store sales fell 12% for quarter, 0.7% for 9 months. 
Chmn.-CEO Robert Oyster said company was "disappointed" with drops
in same-store sales, which he blamed on "continued competitive
pressures" and "a sluggish retailing environment."  While company
was "not surprised with lower comparable-store sales given the
competitive environment in which we are presently operating, we had
hoped to see growth during the beginning of the holiday selling
season," Oyster said.  "Another phenomenon which causes pressure on
comparable-store sales occurs when we increase the number of
locations in a particular market," he said.  "While it is difficult
to quantify the amount of sales drawn from existing locations to
the new location, we do know that comparable-store sales will be
affected when we open a new store in an existing market area."

     Onkyo's Japanese parent said it expects to post ordinary

     Onkyo's Japanese parent said it expects to post ordinary
profit of Yen 900 million for fiscal year ending in March.  Company
originally had projected 45% profit rise to Yen one billion on 7%
sales increase to Yen 42 billion.  However, slower-than-expected
sales in Europe in 2nd half of year caused company to revise profit
projection downward.  Despite revision, profit projection would be
sufficient to negate cumulative multiyear Onkyo loss, which at its
worst was Yen 4 billion.

     International Federation of Phonographic Industry (IFPI),

     International Federation of Phonographic Industry (IFPI),
London-based music industry trade group, said it had to shut down
Guangdong, China, office because of threats arising from its
efforts to thwart CD piracy.  There are 297 CD and CD-ROM plants in
world, of which 30 are in China, and pirated copies represent 59%
of China's CD market, IFPI has said.  "We've heard through somebody
that contract killers have been employed," IFPI Communications Dir.
Catrin Hughes said.  Leads were "pretty solid," Hughes said.  "It's
not the sort of thing you take a chance on."  IFPI offices in
Beijing and Shanghai remain open, and Guangdong office will go back
on line as soon as threat is resolved, she said.  In recent years,
threats forced temporary closures in Taiwan and Thailand.  "We
reopened in Taiwan, and now we've cleaned up the market," Hughes
said.  IFPI Dir. Gen. Nic Garnett said his group had heard "from
reliable sources" that hit men had been contracted for by Chinese
CD factories targeted for piracy investigations.  He said "we are
looking to the Chinese authorities to provide us with the necessary
security to carry on our operations."  China's 30 CD factories
produce 75 million discs annually.  IFPI said it believes as many
as 45 million of those are pirated copies that sell on Chinese
streets for few dollars.  In Oct., after 2 years of negotiations
with IFPI and under pressure from Clinton Administration, Chinese
govt. agreed to adopt worldwide antipiracy "source identification"
(SID) codes administered by IFPI in London.  Under agreement, all
of China's CD factories are obligated to etch ID numbers on all
molds used to press CDs.  Since Nov., any CD offered for sale in
China without SID can be confiscated by authorities.  Referring to
reported threats of contract killers, Garnett said "we have clearly
reached a critical point if the pirates have to resort to these
measures."

     Lucasfilm THX Div. said it has worked with "several" THX

     Lucasfilm THX Div. said it has worked with "several" THX
licensees to develop center-channel speakers for home theater
"whose horizontal design simplifies placement and maximizes
performance."  New speaker designs "combine the low, horizontal
shape popular with home theater consumers with a new driver layout
that provides the focused vertical directivity required in a
THX-certified speaker," licensor said.  Special vertical
"midrange-tweeter-midrange" array, flanked by pair of woofers,
"focuses the sound toward the viewer while providing a wide and
even horizontal dispersion of sound," it said.  Home THX Dir.
Anthony Grimani said development "is an important step for home
theater.  Consumers are going to enjoy better-sounding systems
because they can place their speakers correctly where before there
was always a compromise.  They're getting a speaker that meets all
of the THX requirements and their needs as well.  First to market
new speakers are Atlantic Technology, McIntosh, Snell.
