<p>An open letter to the nation's drug czar<br>
<br>
General Barry McCaffrey<br>
Director, Office of Drug Policy<br>
The White House<br>
<br>
<br>
Dear Gen. McCaffrey:<br>
Our great country is reeling from wounds which we have been
inflicting upon<br>
ourselves because of our current failed drug policy. It is clear
that we<br>
are not in better shape today than we were five years ago
regarding drug<br>
use and abuse and all of the crime and misery which accompany
them, and,<br>
unless we change our approach, we can have no legitimate
expectation that<br>
we will be in better shape next year than we are today. However,
we will<br>
not pursue change until we realize, as a country, that it is all
right to<br>
talk about this issue - and that just because we talk about the
possibility<br>
of changing our drug policy does not mean that we condone drug
use or<br>
abuse.<br>
Change for the better starts with a leader who has a proven
record of<br>
honesty, dedication, experience, and results - one who will be
able to<br>
discuss realities without effectively being labeled as
&quot;soft&quot; on crime or<br>
criminals. Our country desperately needs a person in authority
who will<br>
not be afraid to take a fresh and objective look at our most
basic<br>
assumptions and recommend changes based upon the evidence. Our
country<br>
needs you.<br>
You are known to be an intelligent, non-political, dedicated
public servant<br>
who is in that position of authority and respect.<br>
If you would speak about our country's futile efforts to
eradicate the<br>
growing of these dangerous drugs in, and the shipping of them
from, various<br>
foreign countries, people in and out of our government will
listen.<br>
<br>
If you would quote the Rand Corporation study of June, 1994,
which<br>
concluded that drug treatment is seven times more effective than
drug<br>
prosecution even for heavy drug users and 11 times more effective
than<br>
interdiction at our country's borders, people will begin to
realize why we<br>
are going broke trying to incarcerate our way out of this
pervasive and<br>
multi-faceted problem.<br>
<br>
If you would acknowledge that no one in law enforcement will even
tell us<br>
with a straight face that we seize more than 10 percent of the
illegal<br>
drugs in our society and that the more candid estimate is that we
seize<br>
only about five percent, our people will begin to understand that
each<br>
seizure of a ton of cocaine is not a victory, but is instead
merely a<br>
symptom of the depth of the problem.<br>
Our citizens and taxpayers will then realize that for every ton
of cocaine<br>
we seize, we easily fail to seize between nine and 19 tons.<br>
In the War on Drugs, victory is now literally being viewed as
slowing down<br>
the pace of defeat.<br>
Our present policy has made cocaine the most lucrative crop in
the history<br>
,of mankind. It has made marijuana the most lucrative crop in my
home<br>
state of California, easily outdistancing the second leading
crop, which is<br>
corn.<br>
Our present policy is directly responsible for the material and<br>
demonstrable reduction of our cherished liberties under the Bill
of Rights.<br>
Our present policy is directly funneling tens of billions of
dollars per<br>
year into organized crime, with all of its accompanying violence
and<br>
corruption, both in our country and around the world.<br>
Our present policy is directly causing our children in the inner
cities and<br>
virtually everywhere else to have drug dealers as their role
models,<br>
instead of people like you who have gotten their education and
who have<br>
worked hard to be successful.<br>
Our present policy has directly spawned a cycle of hostility by
the<br>
incarceration of vastly disproportionate numbers of our minority
groups.<br>
<br>
And our present policy is directly responsible for medical
doctors being<br>
unable to prescribe appropriate medications for their patients
who are<br>
either in pain or are suffering from a number of devastating
diseases.<br>
We all understand the necessity of holding people accountable for
their<br>
actions. However, our citizens recognize that what we are doing
in the<br>
critical area of drug policy is not working. They are frustrated
because<br>
their ostensible leaders are afraid to discuss the subject
openly.<br>
As a result, thousands of Americans such as Dr. Milton Friedman,
former<br>
Secretary of State George Shultz, Mayor Kurt Schmoke of
Baltimore, and<br>
former San Jose Chief of Police Joseph McNamara have signed a
resolution<br>
calling for the investigation of change by a neutral commission.<br>
This resolution actually was passed by Congress and signed into
law by<br>
President Clinton as a part of the recent crime bill; however, it
has been<br>
widely ignored since that time. The signatories include a
formidable list<br>
of judges; civic, business, and religious leaders; probation
officers and<br>
prison officials; medical doctors; teachers; and counselors.
There is wide<br>
support for the investigation of change - our present policy
simply will<br>
not stand scrutiny. However, our country needs a credible person
in<br>
government like you to step forward and legitimize the
discussion.<br>
We do not ask you to support any particular method or approach
for<br>
addressing the drug problem. We simply ask you to agree that
there are<br>
fundamental problems with our current policy and that both our
government<br>
and our citizens need better to understand the history and social
forces<br>
which drive this problem, and our options for the future.<br>
We need to investigate the possibility of change. Education and
the honest<br>
exchange of information are the only ways we will begin to reduce
the<br>
continuing harm wrought by these dangerous drugs in our country.<br>
Accordingly, we ask you publicly to join us in a non-partisan and<br>
non-political search for the truth. If you would do this, you
simply could<br>
not provide our country and all of its people with a greater or
more<br>
lasting service. </p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
Judge James P. Gray<br>
Judge Gray is a judge in the Superior Court of California in
Orange County.<br>
</p>
