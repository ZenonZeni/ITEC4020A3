<p><strong>Crystalline Silicon</strong>
<P>
Crystalline silicon is likely to continue to dominate PV markets at least through the year
2000. With its relatively high efficiency and stability, competitive cost, and proven track
record, it plays a dominant role in both domestic and international markets. In 1994,
modules made of crystalline and multicrystalline silicon accounted for about 95% of all
the modules sold by U.S. PV manufacturers. 
<P>
Today's crystalline silicon <a href="device.html">devices</a> are more efficient than ever before.
Laboratory cells made from single-crystal silicon have measured <a href="conveff.html">efficiencies</a> as high as 24%. Research on manufacturing improvements has pushed the
efficiencies of multicrystalline devices to nearly 18% for laboratory cells and over 15%
for prototype modules. Commercial modules of 14% efficiency are made in mass
production.

<P>
Our research focuses on reducing the cost of electricity from commercial flat-plate
modules by increasing the efficiency of low-cost materials. The low-cost silicon used by
industry has lower efficiencies than that of the pure silicon used in the laboratory.
Defects and impurities in the material interfere with photo-electric conversion and the
transmission of electrons within the cells and modules. Armed with an understanding of
the microscopic and atomic processes at work, researchers are working with industry to
devise techniques of material growth and device processing that circumvent or
compensate for these impurities and defects.

We are also working with industry to push the efficiency limits of pure silicon-based
devices. The emitter-wrap-through cell, for example, employs both positive and negative
electrical contacts on the cell's back surface. This technology could reduce
manufacturing costs and prevent current losses due to shading by metallic grids.
<P>
Increasing the efficiency of crystalline materials through improved processing is a major
goal of the PV Program's Crystalline Silicon Research Cooperative, whose partners
include six U.S. manufacturers and the <a href="rescen.html">national laboratories</a>.
Researchers at <a href="nrel.html">NREL</a> and <a href="sandia.html">Sandia</a> characterize materials prepared by industry to help them assess changes in manufacturing processes. University
researchers, including those at the DOE PV Center of Excellence at Georgia Institute of
Technology, also play a key role in this work.
