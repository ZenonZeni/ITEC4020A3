THE SHADOW PUSHERS TARGET AMERICA'S YOUTH</CENTER>

The &quot;shadow pushers&quot; are the aging marijuana users and advocates
who try to legitimize their drug of choice and perpetuate their crusade
to legalize marijuana. They have embraced slick marketing and promotional
techniques that target a new generation of potential marijuana advocates.
Media blitzes, billboard and print advertising, celebrity endorsements and
promotion, logo merchandising, mainstream outlet distribution, religious
and environmental sensitivities, and compassion for the ill and suffering;
all of these techniques have been used. Their most potent weapon is subterfuge.
Keep the masses ignorant of the facts, and manipulate and distort the truth.
<BR>
<BR>
They try desperately to separate marijuana from the other dangerous mind-altering
drugs. They call it hemp! They call it medicine! They portray themselves
as caring and compassionate. They do whatever they can to get attention
and sound rational; they conceal their true agenda - complete LEGALIZATION
OF MARIJUANA. They target America's youth by going to college campuses in
an attempt to recreate themselves and their own college experiences of spacing
out, promoting peace and free love while rebelling against the establishment.
They desperately need new recruits to emulate their ideals and their lifestyle.
<BR>
<BR>
But unlike the 60's and 70's, smoking pot and legalizing marijuana is not
well received by the general public today, so the shadow pushers have disguised
their intent and turned to promoting hemp to save the environment and promoting
medical marijuana to end pain and suffering. Richard Cowan, former director
of NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and Drug
Policy Foundation Board of Advisors clarifies their point of view, &quot;Medical
marijuana is....our strongest suit. It is our point of leverage which will
move us toward the legalization of marijuana for personal use.&quot;1 <BR>
<P><CENTER><STRONG>STRATEGY NUMBER ONE - MARIJUANA, THE MEDICAL MAGIC BULLET</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>Let's look at what the shadow pushers mean by medical marijuana. They
insist pot smoking will help America's sick and terminally ill. No credible
medical or scientific data supports such an outrageous claim, but they say
it, and the media prints or broadcasts it. In 1979, Emory University students
were told that NORML would help reclassify marijuana as medicine for chemotherapy
patients, &quot;as a red herring to give marijuana a good name....&quot;
2 A synthetic form of THC (the only chemical in marijuana identified as
therapeutic) is available by prescription, but that is not good enough for
the shadow pushers. If they acknowledge that a pharmaceutical preparation
is already legal and available, they can't push for growing and using pot
without legal restriction. They would lose their political agenda and their
profit potential. <BR>
<BR>
So they push the need to smoke pot by exploiting the fears and desperation
of sick people and their families. The shadow pushers do not tell the public,
and the media rarely includes scientific fact with the marijuana propaganda,
that smoking marijuana can weaken and damage the immune system. Crude leaf
marijuana can irritate the lungs and introduce bacteria and fungal organisms
that can lead to infection and upper respiratory arrest. <BR>
<BR>
To successfully market an idea or a product, the promoter would never want
the target audience to know that the product is not proven safe or effective.
The truth is, AIDS and chemotherapy patients have an extremely weakened
immune system, and smoking pot can be extremely dangerous to them and other
ailing Americans. But the shadow pushers cleverly conceal the potential
dangers of smoking marijuana. Why do they conceal the dangers? Because they
would risk losing their legalization goal! Why don't the media reveal the
risks to sick people smoking pot as &quot;medicine&quot;? Because they rarely
know or believe the truth, and the shadow pushers use the media to their
advantage. Marijuana advocates have been carefully trained. In a media workshop
at the 1985 NORML conference advocates were instructed to, &quot;stroke
the egos of reporters. They like to be courted, they like to have attention
paid to them.&quot;3 These advocates are not concerned about substantiating
claims because, most of their press releases get publicized anyway. <BR>
<BR>
Case in point: in 1985 NORML head Kevin Zeese sent out a press release claiming
that marijuana had become the largest cash crop in the country. This information
was never verified. There was no real way to substantiate such a claim,
but this &quot;fact&quot; was publicized all over the country in major newspapers.4
<BR>
<BR>
Wow, what a break for the shadow pushers! They can tell lies, distort the
truth, exaggerate, or fantasize. It doesn't matter if what they say is not
proven by reputable scientific fact -- they just say what they want, and
it usually gets printed. In the last few months, their ideas and fantasies
have received increasing attention on major television networks. Nonscientific
claims with no solid base of medical evidence have been printed and broadcast
repeatedly until Americans, young and old, believe what they hear and read.
The marketing is effective, appallingly effective. <BR>
<BR>
The medical marijuana scam has reached our youth! Young people believe the
propaganda, repeat the misconceptions, and tell themselves and each other
that marijuana is natural, that God created it, that it is less harmful
than tobacco and alcohol, and that it couldn't be bad because it is used
for medicine. <BR>
<BR>
So smoking crude leaf marijuana for medicine becomes a successful marketing
tool for the shadow pushers. The truth doesn't reach the public and the
legalizers become the winners; the kids, their parents, the community, the
country, and especially the sick and the vulnerable, become the losers.
<BR>
<BR>
This marketing strategy has unfortunately gotten a boost from the tragic
HIV/AIDS epidemic. As stated in High Times Greatest Hits, &quot;Due in large
part to the growing AIDS crisis, the fight for medical marijuana has become
the most important issue in the battle for legalization.&quot;5 <BR>
<P><CENTER><STRONG>STRATEGY NUMBER TWO - HEMP FOR VICTORY</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>The marketing of hemp fabric and novelty products started out as a cottage
industry targeting the counterculture; but by calling marijuana or pot &quot;hemp&quot;,
a new twist for respectability and mainstreaming became available to the
shadow pushers. <BR>
<BR>
Direct from High Times Greatest Hits comes insight into this marketing strategy.
&quot;Hemp Clothing Is Here! Suddenly, out of nowhere came Stoned Wear,
a new line of hemp clothing and products.... High Times editors were skeptical,
as the clothing samples sent were only 55% hemp and 45% cotton. Is this
the real thing or not, we asked? <BR>
<BR>
Then we met Matthew Cheng and Alex Shum, the two men who are importing the
hemp fabric. Matthew and Alex feel that the way to legalize marijuana is
to sell marijuana legally. When you can buy marijuana in your neighborhood
shopping mall, IT'S LEGAL! So, they are going to produce every conceivable
thing out of hemp: hemp shirts, hemp pants, hemp jackets, hemp hats, hemp
oven mittens, hemp towels, hemp pot holders, hemp books, hemp comics, hemp
scratch pads, and hemp stationery. Anything and everything you can think
of will be made of hemp.&quot;6 <BR>
<BR>
And it is all coming true. Hemp is being promoted as a fabric, a fiber,
an environmental savior; a true marketing find for the shadow pushers. Even
Adidas has joined the counterculture's marketing of hemp to America's youth
by introducing a sport shoe called &quot;The Hemp&quot; with hemp tops and
hemp shoelaces. Everyone is cashing in! But the cash is often coming from
our children's pockets, and the hemp hype is promoting a strong psychoactive
drug - marijuana. Hemp, as a word, is confusing, which adds to the benefits
of the marijuana legalization efforts. Marijuana (pot, weed, reefer, bud,
chronic, blunt, dope, ganja, etc.) is generally called Cannabis Indica or
Indian Hemp or Cannabis sativa. &quot;True hemp&quot; is Cannabis sativa
L. There are other fibers that are referred to by the generic name &quot;hemp&quot;,
which can be Manila hemp or abaca, sisal hemp or henequen, New Zealand hemp,
jute and others.7 Only the &quot;true hemp&quot; comes from the cannabis
plant, the same plant as the psychoactive drug, marijuana. <BR>
<BR>
Whether &quot;true hemp&quot; or a generic hemp fiber, the shadow pushers
just call it &quot;hemp&quot;. They interchange hemp and the word marijuana
whenever they want and whenever it suits their purpose. They market &quot;hemp&quot;
as an environmentally sound fiber, and just like the smoking marijuana for
&quot;medicine&quot; strategy, their claims about &quot;hemp&quot; being
the environmental magic bullet gets printed and repeated with no scientific
proof. Remember, they have learned they do not have to substantiate their
claims; it gets printed anyway. <BR>
<BR>
The kids buy into the marijuana propaganda hook, line, and sinker; so do
many adults. America's environmental idealism gets exploited just like the
sick and terminally ill get exploited. The marketing strategies are working.
<BR>
<BR>
In the September 1993 issue of Madamoiselle, Rob Buchanan writes, &quot;To
the antidrug lobby, the medical marijuana argument is a cynical attempt
by recreational users to capitalize on sympathy for the ill, just as the
industrial-use argument tries to cash in on the sympathy for the environment....&quot;
That premise is supported by the very actions of the marijuana promoters
and the words of their leaders. &quot;It's the 'leaky bucket' strategy,&quot;
says Eric Sterling, marijuana promoter and president of the Criminal Justice
Foundation. &quot;Legalize it (marijuana) in one area, and sooner or later
it will trickle down into the others.&quot;8 <BR>
<BR>
Yes, the shadow pushers know what they are marketing. They are marketing
the legalization of marijuana and they are targeting America's youth. Besides
marijuana leaf logo clothes and novelty items, besides &quot;hemp&quot;
clothes and products, they have utilized the most powerful youth spell binder
available -- rock music and rap groups! <BR>
<P><CENTER><STRONG>STRATEGY NUMBER THREE - LOSE YOURSELF IN THE MUSIC AND
THE BEAT</STRONG></CENTER>
<P>Hempilation (1995 Capricorn Records), a CD featuring a variety of rock
bands, vividly demonstrates this marketing approach. This album was produced
to benefit NORML, and it shamelessly promotes pot smoking. This album includes:
<BR>

  <DD>I Wanna Get High by Cypress Hill 
  <DD>I Want To Take You Higher by Blues Traveler 
  <DD>Don't Step On The Grass, Sam by Gov't Mule 
  <DD>Champagne & Reefer by Ian Moore 
  <DD>Sweet Leaf by Sacred Reich 
  <DD>Who's got The Herb by 311 
  <DD>I Like Marijuana by David Peel And The 360's 
  <DD>High Time We Went by The Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies 
  <DD>Smokin' Cheeba Cheeba by High Fidelity 
  <DD>Pot Head Pixies by Raging Slab 
  <DD>Legalize It by Sublime 
  <DD>Homegrown by Gus 
  <DD>And It Stoned Me by Widespread Panic 
</DL>
High Times magazine promotes this album in a full-page ad offering hempilation
T-shirts and hemp baseball hats. When asked about their special support
of NORML, High Times replied: &quot;High Times' founder Tom Forcade worked
closely with NORML, and the magazine will continue to support the group
until legalization is realized.&quot;9 <BR>
<BR>
In High Times Greatest Hits the editors say, &quot;In 1993, rock and rap
stars moved to the forefront of the legalization movement.&quot; Cyprus
Hill's Sen Dog states, &quot;in all our demos, we rhymed about gettin' high.
It's just something that comes natural to us.&quot;10 The shadow pushers
tell America's youth, be hip -- do drugs--be like us. Marijuana is OK, it's
healthy, and it's good for the environment. <BR>
<BR>
Marketing marijuana, marketing illicit drug use, marketing lies for profit
and political gain; the shadow pushers know no shame. <BR>
<BR>
At the Hempfest in Seattle, Sarah Ferguson writes, &quot;...with the late-summer
sun came crowds, thousands upon thousands of ganja fans, hemp fanatics,
medical marijuana crusaders, and stoned-out rockers, ready to fete the herb
in all its glory.&quot;11 <BR>
<BR>
Our young people flock to these hemp/marijuana/pot festivals, they learn
to glorify the herb, glorify hemp, and glorify the mind-altering drug -
marijuana. <BR>
<BR>
The shadow pushers say: <BR>
