<H2>How can I afford energy-efficient products if they cost
more?</H2>
</center>
<br clear=all>
<br>
<P>Energy efficiency is a feature which often, but not
always, adds to the first-cost of a product. For many government
agencies, limited budgets make it tempting to select a product with the
lowest initial purchase price.  Many government agencies in the U.S.
have adopted policies that require consideration of the lowest
life-cycle cost, including not only purchase price but energy and other
operating costs.  Life-cycle costing is viewed as a sound business
practice, and investments in energy-efficient products may offer a much
higher return than most other uses of available funds.</P>

<P>For some
energy-using equipment such as motors and air conditioners, energy
operating costs over the product's lifetime will represent many times
the initial purchase price of the product. In some cases (for example,
lighted exit signs) the payback from choosing a more efficient product
can be less than one year.  This allows an agency to "finance" the added
purchase cost for an efficient unit from its annual operating budget.</P>

<P>
For larger equipment such as chillers or boilers, financing of the added
cost of efficient features may be available as part of the purchase
loan, or on as part of an equipment lease from a supplier or contractor.
 In some cases, an "energy savings performance contract" can be used, to
obtain third-party financing that is repaid (partly) through shared
energy cost savings.</P>

<P>Finally, some energy-efficient products may
cost no more than less efficient models--especially if they are
purchased competitively, in large volumes.  As energy-efficient
electronic ballasts for fluorescent lights are becoming more common in
U.S. commercial buildings, their added cost has declined sharply.  A
recent purchase of refrigerators for several thousand public housing
units in New York City found that a new model, 30% more efficient than
those previously available, actually had a lower first-cost than the
conventional model.</P>
