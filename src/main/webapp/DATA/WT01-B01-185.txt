<P>
Computer Motion is the leader in medical robotics and
has pioneered this new and growing industry.  The company is committed
to developing, marketing, and selling robotic devices that enhance
the surgeon's capabilities and improve outcomes while reducing
costs.  
<P>
CMI's product development strategy leverages from its initial
product, the AESOP System, and leads to a family of products that
enable new minimally invasive surgical  procedures in a more cost-
effective environment.  The company's vision for the &quot;OR
of the Future&quot; includes robotic devices that provide better
visualization for minimally invasive techniques, improved dexterity
for the surgeon, intuitive human-machine interfaces, and telesurgical
capability.
<P>
The Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning (AESOP)
is a robotic system that approximates the form and function of
a human arm and positions the laparoscope during laparoscopic
surgery.  It is the only robotic system which has been cleared
by the US Food and Drug Administration (&quot;FDA&quot;) for use
in surgery.  Laparoscopic surgery frequently requires the surgeon to use
both hands to manipulate the surgical instruments, and the task
of controlling the laparoscope is relegated to someone other than
the operating surgeon.  AESOP returns direct control of the visual
field to the surgeon, eliminates the need for a human scope holder,
and provides a rock-steady image.
<P>
AESOP was introduced during the fourth quarter of 1994.  As of
December 1995, over 100 medical institutions have incorporated
AESOP into their operating room suites and over 13,000 surgical
procedures to date have been performed in Gynecology, General
Surgery, and Urology.
<P>
Computer Motion was founded by Dr. Yulun Wang in 1989 for
the purposes of developing advanced robotics and high performance,
real-time computer hardware.  The Company has performed robotics
research and built application-specific robots for a number of
government agencies, including NASA, the National Science Foundation,
the National Institute of Health, and the United States Navy.
<P>
With the core technical team assembled, the Company added sales,
marketing, finance, and operations personnel and is now 100% focused
on the development and commercialization of medical robots.
<P>
Computer Motion, located in Goleta, CA (just outside of
Santa Barbara), is a privately held company.<BR>
