<TITLE>Regulation - Technological/Social Aspects</TITLE>
<H1>Regulation - Technological/Social Aspects</H1>

<UL>
<LI> Clipper proposal is also formally known as FIPS 185. <P>
<LI> The bottom line is, now that encryption technology is in the
     hands of the users, there is <B>nothing</B> the government can do
     <I>even today</I> to spy on its citizens. <P>
<LI> The Clipper Chip, however, is not about giving the government the
     right to spy on its citizens; first of all it is restricted to
     the telephone system, and secondly it is volutnary.  In Dorothy
     Denning's words,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any
other high speed computer network. It is for the telephone system.
Quoting from FIPS 185: "Data for purposes of this standard includes
voice, facsimile and computer information communicated in a telephone
system. A telephone system for purposes of this standard is limited to
a system which is circuit switched and operating at data rates of
standard commercial modems over analog voice circuits or which uses
basic-rate ISDN or a similar grade wireless service." <P>

The standard will not make it any easier to tap phones, let alone
computer networks.  All it will do is make it technically possible to
decrypt communications that are encrypted with the standard, assuming
the communications are not superencrypted with something else. <P>
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI> The obvious question, then, is "when will the other shoe drop?" <P>
     Clearly even the NSA alone is clearsighted enough to realize
     criminals and the like, who would be targets of wiretapping,
     would either superencrypt over Clipper, or use alternative
     technologies entirely.  Therefore FIPS 185 must be the precursor
     to legislation which would outlaw strong non-government-approved
     encryption entirely. <P>

<H2> A Brief Overview of PGP, and Patented Algorithms </H2>
     <UL>
     <LI> RSA patented by PKP, which holds almost <B>all</B> useful
          public-key strong encryption patents.  They produce RIPEM. <P>
     <LI> patent violations of RSA have not to date been taken to
          court; a lawyer's letter has usually sufficed to get the
          offending software (PGP) removed from public access. <P>
     <LI> most recently however a company which has been licensed by PKP
	  has been in touch with Zimmerman, and a legal version of PGP may
	  be on the horizon. <P>

<H2> digital telephony bill </H2>

    Though not specifically listed as a target in the proposal, many people are
calling Digital Telephony "Son of S. 266," a failed Senate bill that required
the same "dumbing-down" for encryption as the F.B.I. proposal does for phone
systems. In other words, makers of encryption devices or software were to be
required to leave a "back door" open for law -enforcement and security agencies
that wanted to decode encrypted communication. <P>
