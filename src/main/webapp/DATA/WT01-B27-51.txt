<p><font size="5">THE POLICY OF HEMP DRUG ADMINISTRATION<br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p><b>General principles regarding sumptuary laws and their
application to India.</b> </p>

<p>553. The question of prohibiting the growth of the hemp plant
and the sale of ganja and allied drugs is one which stands in the
to forefront Of the present inquiry. It has been remarked by a
well known historian that &quot;no<i> </i>laws are of any service
which are above the working level of public morality, and the
deeper they are carried down into life, the larger become the
opportunities of evasion. If these words are true as applied to
England under a feudal system, they are much more true in the
present day as applied to British India. The Government of this
country has not grown out of the forces contained within it, but
has been superimposed upon them, and the paternal system of
government which may have been suitable in England during the
sixteenth century, and in, the initial development of some Indian
provinces during the period immediately following their
annexation, becomes purely visionary when public opinion is in
process of formation and the needs of the people are year by year
finding more ready expression. Occasionally, no doubt, the
Legislature in India has anticipated a standard of morality not
universally accepted by the people, as in the case of laws
relating to infanticide or the burning of Hindu widows; but these
measures were passed under an overwhelming sense of the necessity
of correcting popular notions of morality in matters coming well
within the sphere of Government, and in the assurance that in the
course of time they could not fail to secure the assent of all
intelligent members of the community. In the chapter of Mill's
Political Economy which treats of the non-interference principle,
a distinction is made between two kinds of intervention by the
Government-- the one authoritative interference, and the other
giving advice or promulgating information. And the following
remarks are made regarding the former: </p>

<p>&quot;It is evident, even at first sight, that the
authoritative form of Government intervention has a much more
limited sphere of legitimate action than the other. It requires a
much stronger necessity to justify it in any case, while there
are large departments of human life from which it must be
unreservedly and imperiously excluded. Whatever theory we adopt
respecting the foundation of the social union, and under whatever
political institutions we live, there is a circle around every
individual human being which no Government, be it that of one, or
of few, or of the many, ought to be permitted to overstep there
is a part of the life of every person who has come to years of
discretion within which the individuality of that person ought to
reign uncontrolled either by any other individual or by the
public collectively. That there is, or ought to be, some space in
human existence thus entrenched around no one who professes the
smallest regard to human freedom or dignity will call in
question: the point to be determined is where the limit should be
placed; how large a province of human life this reserved
territory should include. I apprehend that it ought to include
all that part which concerns only the life, whether inward or
outward of the individual, and does not affect. the interests of
Others, or affect. them only through the moral influence of
example. With respect to the domain of the inward consciousness,
the thoughts and feelings, and as much of external conduct as is
personal only, involving no consequences, none at least of a
painful or injurious kind, to other people, I hold that it is
allowable in all, and in the more thoughtful and cultivated often
a duty, to assert and promulgate with all the force they are
capable of their opinion of what is good or bad, admirable or
contemptible, but not to compel others to conform to that
opinion, whether the force used is that of extra legal coercion,
or exerts itself by means of the law. Even in those portions of
conduct which do affect the interests of others, the onus of
making out a case always lies on the defenders of legal
prohibitions.<i> </i>It is not merely a constructive or
presumptive injury to others which will justify the interference
of law with individual freedom. To be prevented from what one is
inclined to, or from acting contrary to one's own judgment of
what is desirable, is not only always irksome, but always tends, <i>pro
tanto, </i>to starve the development of some portion of the
bodily or mental faculties, either sensitive or active; and,
unless the conscience of the individual goes freely with the
legal restraint, it partakes, either in a great or in a small
degree, of the degradation of slavery. Scarcely any degree of
utility short of absolute necessity will justify a prohibitory
regulation, unless it can also be made to recommend itself to the
general conscience; unless persons of ordinary good intentions
either believe already, or can be induced to believe, that the
thing prohibited is a thing which they ought not to wish to
do.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p>These remarks have been given at length, because the
Commission believe that they contain a clear exposition of the
principles which should guide them in deciding whether the
prohibition of the hemp drugs should be authoritatively enforced
by Government. <br>
</p>

<p><b>The question of entirely suppressing all intoxicants.</b> </p>

<p>554- Now, a certain number of .persons (among whom may in all
probability,- be reckoned the mover of the question in the, House
of Commons which led to the appointment of the-Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission) deem it to be the duty of the British Government to
suppress the trade in all intoxicants in all the countries under
its sway; and there are no doubt special circumstances<i> </i>in
India which render it less, impossible than in some other
countries to consider even so drastic a policy. These are notably
the general sobriety of its races and the feeling, popular as
well as religious, which prevails against their use among a large
section of the community. Even then no appeal in support of such
a measure can be made to the public morality <font
face="Courier New"><font size="4"><tt>or </tt></font>practice of
civilised nations at large, nor, so far as the Commission are
aware, to any marked success attending the experiment in
particular instances. In the exceptional cases in which the
experiment has been attended with partial success (as in some of
the American States), the reformation of the habit has become an
object of desire to the majority of the people, and the enactment
for promoting Such reformation has presented itself less as a
restrictive force than as an auxiliary agency <br>
</font></p>

<p><b>Not laid before the commission</b> </p>

<p>555. But the Commission are not called upon to pronounce on so
wide an issue. It was not upon the basis of this general
principle that the Secretary of State for India accepted the
proposal made in the House of Commons, nor do the instructions
issued to the Commission by the Government of India cover so wide
a field. The question of prohibiting the production and sale of
the hemp drugs in India has to be considered by the Commission
apart from the general question, and such prohibition must be
justified, if at all, on some more special ground than the mere
fact that they are intoxicants.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The past history of the case how far to be relied upon.</b>
</p>

<p>556. Again, there are a certain number of persons whose'
evidence before the Commission points to the assumption that the
case for prohibition of the hemp drugs has already been
established in the records of the Government, and that further
enquiry implies a willful blindness to what has been abundantly
proved by such records. A reference to Chapter XII of this Report
will show how untrustworthy these records are in regard to the
production of insanity by the use of the drugs-- an aspect of the
question which is of the utmost importance, and has formed the
basis of nearly all the official opinion heretofore recorded.
against such use. And, after availing themselves fully of every
opportunity of consulting the official literature on the subject,
the Commission have arrived at the conclusion that it shows
little originality, and that a very limited amount of personal
observation has been made to do duty as the basis of large
conclusions. The want of reliable data has been compensated by
annual reiteration until the stamp of antiquity has secured for
the opinions so expressed a large amount of acquiescence among
officials who had neither the time nor the opportunity to examine
the matter for themselves So far, therefore, as the effects of
the hemp drugs are concerned, the Commission have had to approach
the subject as almost a <i>tabula rasa, </i>and, while availing
themselves of the imperfect data previously collected, have
endeavoured to avoid accepting any conclusions without a
substantial foundation of well ascertained facts. The attitude,
however, of the Government in regard to the question may be
briefly described. So far back as 1798 an inquiry was made in
Bengal regarding the quality of ten intoxicating articles--
&quot;opium, madak ganja, subzi, bhang, majum, banker, charas,
tobacco, and toddy--&quot; with a view to determining whether it
might not be advisable to prohibit altogether the sale of any of
them. The conclusion arrived at, which was stated in a letter of
the Board to the Governor-General in Council, No. 22, dated 29th
May 1798, was to the following effect. &quot;It appears that the
original productions are as follows: Tobacco, opium, ganja, subzi
or bhang, banker, and toddy, and that the three remaining
articles are for the most part compositions of those here
recited, as above mentioned. With respect to the drugs specified
m the foregoing schedule, they are not for the most part
represented as producing any very violent or dangerous effects of
intoxication except when taken to excess; and, although the
operation of them-may be more powerful in their compound state,
we apprehend it would be difficult to sanction the sale of the
original productions, and to prohibit with effect the use of
compositions of which they are susceptible; to which may be added
that most of these articles, both as original productions and as
artificial combinations appear to be useful either in medicine or
otherwise; for these reasons we do not deem it necessary to
recommend that the sale of any of them be altogether prohibited,
but shall proceed to state what appear to us the. best means of
restraining the use of them, and improving the revenue by the
imposition of such taxes as are best adapted to the nature of the
case.&quot; A complete inquiry was made in 1871 from all
provinces as to the effects of several preparations of hemp; and
if the result should call for any action in the direction of
restricting them by enhancement of the duty or of limiting, or
even prohibiting, the cultivation of the. plant, the advice of
the Local Governments was invited as to the expediency and
practicability of such measures. The result is contained in the
Resolution of the Government of. India, Finance Department, No.
3773, dated 17th December 1873. The following passage shows the
conclusion arrived at: <br>
</p>

<p>&quot;Upon a consideration of all the opinions thus collected,
it does not appear to the Governor-General in Council to be
specially proved that hemp incites to crime more than other drugs
or than spirits. And there is some evidence to show that on rare
occasions this drug, usually so noxious, may be usefully taken.
There can, however, be no doubt that its habitual use does
produce insanity. The total number of cases of insanity is small
in proportion to the population, and not large even in proportion
to the number of ganja smokers; but of the cases of insanity
produced by the excessive use of drugs or spirits, by far the
largest number must be attributed to the abuse of hemp. Lower
Bengal the circumstances have admitted of a system under which
the consumption of ganja has been reduced one-half, while the
amount of duty levied on it has been doubled. It would be very
desirable to control the cultivation and preparation of ganja and
bhang elsewhere-in the same way. But it is believed that this
would not be easy; indeed, it would probably be impracticable.
Moreover, with the exception of the Chief Commissioners of
British Burma and the Central Provinces, the Local Governments
are not in favour of altering existing arrangements. His
Excellency in Council, however, trusts that the various Local
Governments and Administrations will endeavour, wherever it may
be possible, to discourage the consumption of ganja and bhang by
placing restrictions on their cultivation, preparation and
retail, and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as can
be levied without inducing illicit practices. As regards British
Burma, the Chief Commissioner has already been informed that the
Governor-General in Council concurs with him in thinking that the
cultivation and consumption of ganja should be absolutely
prohibited, and it has been prohibited from the beginning of the
year 1873-74. &quot;<br>
</p>

<p>In 1877 the Bengal Government appointed a special officer,
Babu Hem Chunder Kerr, to make a full inquiry into the details of
the cultivation of ganja, the sufficiency or otherwise of the
present safeguards, and the reforms which it might be advisable
to introduce. Sir Ashley Eden's conclusions on this officer's
report in regard to the effects of ganja and policy to be
followed were as follows: &quot;The Lieutenant-Governor has
himself no doubt that the use of ganja in any form is injurious
to the consumer, and that it is the duty of Government to make
the tax on this article as high as it can possibly bear.
Unfortunately it is habitually used by large numbers of the lower
classes of the population, who would, if deprived of it
altogether, apparently find in the leaves of the wild hemp plant
and in other drugs narcotics and stimulants of equally
deleterious character. It does not seem possible, therefore, to
stop the cultivation altogether. The policy of Government must be
to limit its production and sale by a high rate of duty without
placing the drug entirely beyond the reach of those who will
insist upon having it.&quot; The last important utterance on the
subject previous to the appointment of the Commission is
contained in the letter of the Government of India, Finance
Department, to Her Majesty's Secretary of State, No. 212, dated
9th August 1892, in which the following remarks occur: &quot;We
are inclined to believe that ganja is the most noxious of all
intoxicants now commonly used in India. But even if the absolute
prohibition of the use of the drug could be enforced, the result
might be to induce the use of still more noxious drugs. India
abounds with plants growing wild from which drugs can be procured
which are more deleterious in their effects than ganja. One such<i>
</i>plant is the dhatura <i>(Stramonium), </i>the seeds of which
are already used to intensify the narcotic effects of bhang, a
liquid preparation of hemp leaves; and we apprehend that if the
use of ganja were suppressed altogether, dhatura might be largely
resorted to by the poorer classes as a means of satisfying their
craving for stimulants. Apart, however, from the objections just
mentioned, we believe. that it would be impossible to enforce in
India a prohibition of the use of ganja. That drug is produced in
Native States, and the difficulties in the way of preventing its
import from them, if the supply in British India were cut off,
would be immense. It would not, moreover, be possible to suppress
the supply in British India. The hemp plant grows readily in
India, in many places wild without cultivation of any kind, and
it would be easy for any one addicted to the use of ganja to grow
a plant or two in the enclosure of his own house and in nooks and
corners which would be safe from observation and from the risk of
detection. The question in the House of Commons suggests that as
the possession and sale of ganja has been prohibited for many
years in Burma, it is desirable that the same prohibition should
be extended to other provinces of British India. The analogy of
Burma does not, however, apply to India. When the prohibition was
enforced in Burma, the drug was very little used by the Native
Burmese, its consumption being almost entirely confined to
coolies and other immigrants from India; and the cultivation of
the plant in Burma, which had never been extensive, had virtually
ceased, the consumers being dependent on importations for their
supplies. In India, on the other hand, the practice of ganja
smoking has existed from time immemorial, and among certain sects
of Hindus, ascetics, and religious mendicants hemp intoxication
is habitually indulged in; and, as explained in the preceding
paragraph, it would be impossible to suppress the growth of the
plant. But, although we consider it impracticable to enforce the
absolute prohibition of the use of ganja, we fully recognise it
as our duty to restrict its consumption as far as practicable,
and we have distinctly laid down the policy to be pursued in
respect of this drug in our Resolution of the 17th December 1873
already quoted. The annual reports of Excise Administration show
that the subject has since been continually before Local
Governments, who are making every possible endeavour to minimise
the evils and discourage the use of the drug wherever it is a
source of danger to consumers.&quot; Thus &quot;restraining the
use and improving, the revenue by the imposition of suitable
taxation,&quot; &quot;discouraging<i> </i>the consumption by
placing restrictions on the cultivation, preparation, and retail,
and imposing on their use as high a rate of duty as can be levied
without inducing illicit practices,&quot; &quot;limiting the
production and sale by a high rate of duty without placing the
drug entirely beyond the reach of those who will insist upon
having it,&quot;<i> </i>&quot;restricting consumption as far as
practicable, minimising the evils, and discouraging the use of
the drug wherever it is a source of danger to consumers&quot;
have from time to time been the watch-words of the Government in
the matter of the hemp drugs, a policy only once definitely
abandoned, <i>viz., </i>in the case of Burma, where total
prohibition was introduced in 1873. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition in other countries.</b> </p>

<p>557. Allusion must be made to precedents for the prohibition
of the hemp drugs in other countries in order to complete these
general observations. Excepting British Burma (reference to which
will be made further on), the Commission only know of four cases
of prohibition, <i>viz., </i>in Turkey, Egypt, Greece, and
Trinidad. For the first three of these, the only information at
the disposal of the Commission is contained in the communications
from Her Majesty's representatives addressed to the Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs in 1892 in consequence of a requisition
made on them by the Earl of Rosebery at the request of Mr. W S
Caine, M.P.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Turkey</b> </p>

<p>558. The ground of the prohibition in Turkey is thus stated in
a note addressed by the Grand Vizir to the Ministry Commerce,
Constantinople, on 1st March 1292 <i>(sic)</i>:&quot;From<i> </i>the
reports furnished by the Imperial Medical Council, it appeared
that the use of hashish in the preparation of medicines was
extremely rare, and that, being a narcotic, its use must of
necessity be injurious, and that consequently the suppression of
the cultivation of hashish could not fail to prove highly
advantageous.&quot; The effect of the prohibition is thus
described in an enclosure to the Ambassador's reply: &quot;The
importation and sale in Turkey of hashish, though contraband, is
still, I hear, largely carried on, and is used for smoking, in
the composition of various sweetmeats, and as an opiate in
general.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>Egypt.</b> </p>

<p>559. In Egypt the cultivation, use, and importation of hashish
were first forbidden in 1868, but in 1874 it was allowed to be
imported on payment of duty. In November 1877 an order was
received from Constantinople that all hashish brought into Egypt
was to be seized and destroyed, and finally, in March 1879, the
importation and cultivation of hashish were prohibited by a
Khedivial decree. In March 1884 it was provided that confiscated
hashish should be sold by the Customs (for delivery abroad)
instead of being destroyed as formerly, and the proceeds of the
sale divided amongst the informers and officers who took part in
the seizure. &quot;This measure was rendered necessary,&quot;
says Mr. Caillard, the Director-General of the Customs, &quot;by<i>
</i>the absence of any fund from which rewards could be
distributed; while, on the other hand, the profits of smuggling
being very great, large sums were paid by the smugglers to insure
the silence or complicity of the Customs officers,
coastguards-men, and others. A considerable number of persons are
employed in the smuggling trade, many of them having subsistence.
Great ingenuity is displayed by the smugglers no other means of
and no sooner has one trick been discovered than another isin
this illicit trade, of the contrainvented. The great obstacle,
however, to the complete repression band trade is the refusal of
some of the European Governments to recognize the right of the
Egyptian Government to search suspected shops or warehouses, and
to punish the delinquents by fine as well as confiscation. In
view of the impossibility of suppressing the contraband trade in
hashish under the suggested to the Minister of Finance
circumstances described above, desirability of removing the
prohibition against the importation of the and I proposed to
collect a customs duty of P. T. 100 per kilogramme (<i>9s. 3d.</i>per
lb.), besides it license-tax on the sale of hashish. It has been
abundantly proved that the vice of hashish smoking cannot be
suppressed by legislation, whereas by a system of licenses it may
be kept under control to some extent. &quot;Mr. Caillard
estimates that the quantity of hashish consumed annually in Egypt
cannot be less than 50,000 okes (about lbs. 140,000)
notwithstanding the prohibition. He states that the hashish
appears to be manufactured chiefly in Greece. </p>

<p><b>Greece.</b> </p>

<p>560. In Greece there is no law regulating or specially
alluding to the product as merchandise is allowed, but a Police
order of 1891 prohibits its sale and consumption in the small
cafes of Athens and the Piroeus, in some of which, during the
previous ten or fifteen years apparently, the habit of using this
drug had been gradually introduced. The order was based upon a
report of the Sanitary Board at Athens, in which prominent
mention is made of the observations made in India by English
doctors, and the statistics of insanity in Bengal lunatic asylums
ascribed to the use of the hemp drugs are put forward as
justifying, repressive measures. The effect of the order passed
is not mentioned, sufficient time not having elapsed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Trinidad..</b> </p>

<p>561<i>. </i>As regards Trinidad, the Commission are not sure
that the hemp drugs are prohibited. The fact has been stated by
the Indian Immigrants Commission, Natal, 1885-87, and by Dr.
Thomas Ireland, Government Medical Officer, British Guiana, in a
paper published in the <i>Alienist and Neurologist, </i>St.
Louis, in October 1893. But,<i> </i>on the other hand,
Surgeon-Major Comins, lately on special duty in British and
Foreign Colonies and the Netherlands, in his Note on Emigration
from India to Trinidad, 1893, quotes a statement of the Protector
of Immigrants, who says that in the year 1885 an Ordinance was
passed requiring the payment of L100 per acre to obtain a license
to grow ganja, which had previously been grown in large
quantities. This practically put a stop to the growth and
consumption for several years, but immigrants who had left
Trinidad two years previous to the writing of his report had been
growing it in Venezuela, and several seizures had been made by
the Customs officers from persons endeavouring to introduce it
into Trinidad. The Protector adds: &quot;With<i> </i>a coast line
such as ours, adjacent to that of the Spanish Main, it will be
impossible to prevent its introduction into this colony if
immigrants who go there continue to grow it.&quot; Dr. Comins
himself says: &quot;I do not know what are the laws in force here
regarding the sale of opium and ganja.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><b>Basis of prohibition and results in these countries</b>. </p>

<p>562.<i> </i>Thus in the case of other countries, where the use
of the drugs has been prohibited, the Commission do not find in
the literature available to them many arguments for prohibition.
In Turkey it rests upon the theory accepted by orthodox
Muhammadans that hashish <i>&quot;being </i>a narcotic its use
must of necessity be injurious,&quot; while in Egypt the
prohibition emanated from Turkey. In both these countries the
measure has by no means been attended with complete success. In
Greece the prohibition in the cafes of Athens is based largely
upon Indian experience, which the Commission have had cause in
great measure to recast. In Trinidad, if there has been
prohibition, it does not seem of late to have been effectual. It
must be added that the Commission have no scientific information
regarding the strength of the article of commerce called hashish,
and it may differ to some extent from the Indian products. From
the description of its manufacture even by the Mayor of
Orchomenus in Mantines in Arcadia, whence the Egyptian supply is
mainly derived, it appears to resemble more the charas of Yarkand
than the ganja or bhang of India.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Is prohibition in India justifiable, feasible, and
advisable?</b> </p>

<p>563. Starting, therefore, from the position that what is known
of the hemp drugs in the past is not sufficient to justify their
prohibition in India, and that for such a measure there must be
strong justification based on ascertained facts scientifically
and systematically examined, the first question for the
Commission to decide is whether such justification is to be found
in the evidence before them, and the second-whether, if this is
so, prohibition is feasible and advisable on other grounds. These
will now be considered. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition of bhang</b> </p>

<p>564. The effects of the hemp drugs have been treated in
Chapters X to XIII of the Report; and as the first result of
these conclusions, the Commission are prepared to state that the
suppression of the use of bhang would be totally unjustifiable.
It is established to their satisfaction that this use is very
ancient, and that it has some religious tion among a large body
of Hindus; that it enters into their social customs; that it is
almost without exception harmless in moderation, and perhaps in
some cases beneficial; that the abuse of it is not so harmful as
the abuse of alcohol; that its suppression, involving the
extirpation of the wild hemp plant, would in some tracts be a
matter of great difficulty; that such a measure would be
extremely unpopular, and would give rise to widespread
discontent; and, finally, that, if successfully accomplished, it
would lead to the use of more hurtful stimulants. The Commission
deem it unnecessary to traverse the evidence further than has
been done in the preceding chapters of this report in support of
these propositions. It is almost unanimous in regard to them. The
utmost that is necessary in regard to this product is that it
should be brought under more effective control, and this matter
will be dealt with further on. But absolute prohibition is, in
the opinion of the Commission, entirely out of the question. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Prohibition of ganja and charas</b> </p>

<p>565. Though it has been shown that as a rule ganja and charas
are used in moderation, and that the moderate use ordinarily.
does not cause appreciable injury, yet it has been established
that the excessive use of these forms of hemp drugs has been more
injurious than in the case of bhang. Whether they should be
prohibited or merely controlled is a question which might be
settled merely with reference to their ascertained effects. The
Commission consider that the effects are not such as to call for
prohibition, and on the general principles discussed in the
opening paragraphs of this chapter, such interference would be
unjustifiable. Nevertheless, it. seems advisable to refer to the
other evidence with a view to ascertaining the generally
prevailing views on the subject, and considering the grounds on
which prohibition is advocated or opposed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>The evidence regarding prohibition of ganja and charas may
be considered together.</b> </p>

<p>566. In reviewing the evidence on these points, it will not be
necessary to draw a distinction between ganja and charas. The
effects of these two drugs have been shown to be similar, though
charas is <i>cateris paribus </i>the more potent. They are both
ordinarily smoked, though very occasionally used for eating and
drinking usually in the form of admixtures with other condiments
stated by Mr. Lyall (Bengal 1): &quot;Ganja<i> </i>and charas are
really one, and in time, if the question be scientifically
followed up, possibly charas will be the only form used.&quot;
The refuse of ganja is used in some provinces as bhang, but this
substance more nearly resembles bhang than ganja properly so
called. The ganja of the different provinces varies in quality.
But these distinctions cannot here be specially observed; it will
be sufficient to bear in mind that the opinions in Bengal, the
Central Provinces, Madras, Bombay, and the smaller
Administrations relate to ganja; that those in the Punjab relate
to charas; and that those in the North-Western Provinces and Sind
relate to ganja and charass, both of which consumed.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Supply of ganja and charas in its relation to prohibition.<font
face="Arial"></b><font size="4"> </font></font> </p>

<p>567. A few remarks, however, recapitulating the local
conditions of ganja and charas will not be out of place. Charas
is practically a foreign article. Small amounts are imported from
Nepal and Gwalior, but they may be left out of the account. The
bulk comes from Yarkand through the Himalayan passes, or to a
much smaller. degree from offer parts of Central Asia through the
routes on the frontier of Afghanistan. It would not be a very
difficult matter to stop these imports, though the co-operation
of the Kashmir Darbar would be necessary in regard to Yarkand
charas. It may, therefore, be accepted that the supply of charas
might be cut off without much difficulty, though, as this article
forms the principal import from Yarkand, the prohibition of
charas would paralyse, if not extinguish, the trade with this
country. In regard to ganja, the problem is more complex. Ganja
is regularly cultivated in Bengal, the Central Provinces, Madras,
Bombay, and Berar. In Bengal and the Central Provinces, the
cultivation of the hemp, plant for its production is under
complete control. In Berer cultivation is only permitted under
license. In the other tracts of British territory it is not
directly Controlled. Assuming that control is possible in these
tracts, it does not follow that it would be equally possible to
prevent cultivation altogether. Moreover, there still remains a
considerable amount of production in many of the Native States
all over India. To induce these States to prohibit cultivation
would be a difficult matter, and, even if this were done, the
suppression of illicit cultivation would offer the most serious
difficulties. For, though ganja of good quality requires some
cultivation and tending, the evidence before the Commission tends
to establish the fact that ganja of an inferior kind can be
manufactured from the spontaneous or casual growth which is found
near human habitations and amidst cultivation of other crops in
many parts of India. While, therefore, it cannot be asserted that
the task of preventing the manufacture of ganja is an impossible
one, it would certainly at the present time be attended with
considerable difficulty.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions of the witnesses regarding prohibition of ganja
and charas. </b></p>

<p>568. The question addressed to the. witnesses regarding the
prohibition of the hemp drugs (No. 35) was so framed as to elicit
in the first place opinions as to the feasibility of such. a
measure. The considerations bearing upon the subject were also
set forth in the form of subsidiary questions. The question
whether the witnesses advocated prohibition. was not specifically
put, but it is not difficult, comparing the answers to the
questions above mentioned with those relating to other questions,
to decide what the opinion of each witness is on this question.
Those who hold decided views have no doubt generally stated them
in some portion of their answers, and at all events ample
opportunity of doing so was afforded them. A larger number of the
witnesses have contented themselves with merely giving an
affirmative or negative answer to the questions on .the subject.
It is impossible to attach much importance to such answers. The
Commission have abstracted them and considered them, but they
feel bound to give far more weight to the opinions of witnesses
whose replies show that they have formulated an opinion, on the
desirability of prohibition. Some account will now be given of
these answers.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions regarding prohibition of ganja and charas.</b> </p>

<p><i>569. </i>Out of the total of 1,193 witnesses, 575 have
expressed a decided opinion on the question of prohibition. Of
these only 99 advocate it in their answers. The remainder are
against it. The classification of these witnesses is shown in the
following table:<br>

</p>

<p>Thus, not only is there a very large preponderance of opinion
against prohibition, but the preponderance is specially marked
among superior Civil officers. The only witnesses indeed of the
latter class who favour prohibition are three in the Punjab,
where charas and not ganja is consumed.<br>
</p>

<p>The most important of these opinions on either side will now
be specified. The most forcible opinions in favour of prohibition
will be quoted at some length in order that the argument for this
view may be .thoroughly appreciated. The opinions against
prohibition are too numerous to be quoted, but the witnesses will
be named under headings setting forth the most prominent views
expressed. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Bengal opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja</b> </p>

<p>570. The Bengal witnesses in favour of prohibition of ganja
consist of a Sub-Deputy Collector, an Assistant Surgeon. two
Medical Practitioners, an Honorary Magistrate, two zamindars, two
pleaders, a delegate from the Indian Relief Society, Calcutta,
the Secretary to the Band of Hope, Faridpur, the Secretary to the
Bogra Medical Society, and two Missionaries. The Commission
cannot find much to quote from these opinions, but the following
are the most forcible: </p>

<p><i>(238) Delegate, Indian Relief Society, Calcutta, Babu
Amrita Krishna Mullick, B.A., B.L.: </i>After quoting official
and medical opinions relating to the injuriousness of ganja, the
Society, endeavours to show that the cultivators of the hemp
plant lose largely by their occupation, and maintains that it is
the duty of the Government to come to their rescue by abolishing
it. The society maintains that the privation to the consumers
would not be serious, and that it is difficult to suggest any
drug more deleterious than ganja to which they could take. The
Society contends that the alleged religious sanction to the use
of the drugs is a fallacy, and refers to the opinions of several
pandits in support of this view. The Society argues that to meet
the deficit in the revenue, which would be about lakhs per annum,
the salaries of European officers should be cut down, the duties
on cotton goods re-imposed and the income-tax increased with an
enhanced taxable minimum. Savings would be effected by reduction
of establishment and by decreased cost of lunatic asylums.<br>
</p>

<p><i>(286) Secretary, Band of Hope Temperance Society, Faridpur,
Babu Purna Chandra Maitra: </i>&quot;This Society begs to urge
upon the Commission to consider the justice and propriety of a
just, benign, and Christian Government to allow cultivation and
sale of a drug which has been excluded from some countries, and
in England doubly protected in the poison list.&quot; The witness
argues that the drug&quot; has been unreservedly condemned by
eminent doctors as one of the most dangerous poisons known, as
the most potent cause of lunacy, and as the most pernicious and
deleterious of all excitants ever in use in any country.&quot; He
admits that there are a number of yogis, sanyasis, fakirs, and
mendicants addicted to ganja smoking, but states that ganja
smoking forms no part of their religion, and there is not a
single Hindu or Muhammadan religious book which sanctions the use
of ganja. &quot;No real disaffection can under the benign rule of
the British Government be seriously apprehended, and, even in the
event of there being such apprehension, the fact should not be
lost sight of that the Government in this case will have the
support of the bulk of the population.&quot; He alleges that
ganja produces crime, and that the taxation, amounting to 22
lakhs, is a drain on the poverty-stricken and half-famished
people of Bengal. He finds it difficult to suggest a substitute
for ganja, but liquor may be one, and a peculiar preparation of
strong tobacco may also serve the purpose. </p>

<p><i>(134) Secretary to Bogra Medical Society (10 members),
Pyari SankerDass </i>Gupta, L.M.S.: &quot;the prohibition will
give rise to no political danger. For the ganja smokers have very
little influence over society. The Government has faced questions
of a greater religious character, as the Suttee or the Age of
Consent Act, with boldness. This is comparatively a minor
question affecting only depraved men.&quot; </p>

<p><i>(203) Rev. W. B. Phillips, Missionary.: </i>&quot;What<i> </i>with
liquor and opium and hemp drugs of various kinds, all licensed by
Government, it does seem as if the population were terribly
exposed to degrading influences. It is not my province to face
the difficult task of dealing with these evils; and I sincerely
sympathize with the Government in the heavy duty of solving the
grave problems involved. But I do feel it my duty to set forth as
strongly as possible the assurance that very much mischief is
being worked in the country by the various intoxicants so freely
and largely sold. I hardly care to distinguish between opium,
alcohol, and ganja. I regard them all as bad. My mind is so
impressed with the evil effects of excessive use that I do not
care to consider the moderate use. I would wish Government to
begin with ganja, to proceed with little delay-against opium, and
then tackle alcohol. I prefer this as a matter of policy, as
ganja is easiest dealt with I am prepared to prohibit all three
intoxicants on account of the evil which I see done by them. </p>

<p><i>(81) Kali Das Mukerji, Sub-Deputy Collector: </i>After
advocating prohibition of ganja on the grounds of the evil
effects, and stating that there would be no danger from the
discontent caused owing to the small number of the consumers, the
witness proceeds: &quot;The<i> </i>reasons usually put forward in
favour of ganja consumption are as follows: (1) that Hindu friars
and jogis cannot do without it, for it helps them in their
religious contemplation, and sustains them under severe exertion
and exposure; (2) that it is a safeguard against disease in
malarious tracts; and (3) that it serves the labouring classes as
a refreshing stimulant, alleviating fatigue. I do not think that
any of these reasons is conclusive, though plausible. In fact,
none of them stands the test of close examination. If any
intoxicating drug is at all necessary for friars and jogis
alcohol, opium or siddhi may serve the purpose. Eight kinds of
intoxicating drugs are prescribed in the Tantras for Hindu
devotees, and it is optional with them to take any if they care
to do so at all. That ganja is a safeguard against disease in
malarious tracts is not necessarily true Even as a stimulant and
remover of fatigue, ganja has very little to recommend it to the
labouring classes A careful observation is sure to establish the
fact that any ordinary labourer whose only stimulant is tobacco
is on the whole a better workman than his ganja consuming
brother.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition of ganja in Bengal.</b> </p>

<p>571. It is impossible to quote the mass of opinion against
prohibition of ganja, but the following analysis of some of the

<p><b>Assam.Assam.Opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja.</b>
</p>

<p>572. The opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja in Assam
are those of a Civil Surgeon, the Secretary to the Tezpur Raiyats
Association, the Secretary to the Upper Assam .Association, a
merchant, and a pensioned Overseer, Public Works Department, and
member of a Local Board. There is nothing especially to note in
these opinions. <br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against.</b>. </p>

<p>573. Against prohibition we have the Commissioner of the Assam
Valley, the Commissioner of Excise, the Director of Land Records
and Agriculture, an Officiating Deputy Commissioner, a Civil
Surgeon, an Extra Assistant Commissioner, a medical practitioner,
four pleaders, and four planters.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Mr. Driberg,</i><b><i> </i></b><i>Commissioner of Excise</i>,
says: &quot;It would be useless to prohibit the use of ganja in a
province like Assam, surrounded as it is by independent hill
people, who would cultivate it in their hills and smuggle it down
with little risk of detection. Any prohibition will only lead to
the increase of illicit consumption and to the secret use of the
drug, which would be decidedly bad; of course, stop cultivation
in Bengal, and the prohibition of the use of excise ganja could
be enforced; but there would be serious discourse, though in this
province it might not amount to a political danger, and the
prohibition would be followed by recourse to opium, and in some
cases to alcohol.&quot; The evidence of planters tends generally
to show that the use of ganja by the garden coolies, who (except
in the western districts of the Assam Valley and those of the
Surma Valley, all of which border on Bengal) are the principal
consumers, produces no serious effects. There is nothing in any
of the Assam evidence to controvert these views. <br>
</p>

<p><b>North-Western Provinces.Opinions in favour of prohibition
of ganja and charas.</b> </p>

<p>574. The advocates of prohibition of ganja and charas in the
North-Western Provinces are as follows: 6 subordinate civil
officers, 9 subordinate medical officers and private medical
practitioners, and 18 non-officials. Butfew of these witnesses
give any reasons for their opinions. And the Commission are not
able to quote any one of them as having any special weight. The
only opinion which it appears worth while to quote is that of a
Collector (Mr. Addis (4), who does not, however, specifically
recommend prohibition. He says: &quot;It probably would be
feasible to prohibit the use of all these drugs. Public opinion
is against their use, and the people are very obedient to
authority. The prohibition would certainly lead to the increased
use of opium and alcohol.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition.</b> </p>

<p>575. On the other hand, the opinions against prohibition are
very strong. The following is an analysis of some of the most
important:- </p>

<p><i>(1) Prohibition impossible or unnecessary, or could not be
enforced without a large preventive establishment.</i> </p>

<p>(1) Hon'ble A. Cadell, Member, Board of Revenue.(5) Mr.
Stoker, Commissioner of Excise(12) Mr. Brownrigg, Officiating

<p><i>(3) Prohibition might lead to use of dhatura or other
intoxicants worse than ganja or charas.</i> </p>

<p>(6) Mr. Stoker, Commissioner of Excise.(15) Mr. Ferard,
Collector (28) Mr. Bruce, Assistant Collector.(51) Thakur Tukman
Singh, Deputy Collector. Punjab 576. The advocates of the
prohibition of charas Opinions for prohibition of charas. in the
Punjab are as follows:-- 3 superior civil officers, 3 subordinate
civi1 officers, 2 subordinate medical officers, and 10
non-officials.It may be noted that <i>Mr. Ogilvie, Financial
Commissioner in charge of Excise (2), </i>records the following
opinion: &quot;I am inclined to hold the opinion, though I am not
quite satisfied on the subject, that the use of charas is so
deleterious that it might be permissible, both on grounds of
morality and utility, for its use to be prohibited or for the
price of the drug to be so artificially raised as to confine its
consumption to a very small number indeed. The reason why I say
that I am not quite satisfied on the point is because I have not
sufficiently investigated the facts. All that I can, therefore,
say with certainty is that my opinion tends to the direction
above indicated I would observe, however, with regard to the
Yarkand trade that the imposition of a duty so high as to be
practically prohibitive would very considerably injure that
trade, . because the Yarkand trader in exchange for the churns
takes back the products of the Punjab to his own country or to
Kashmir. The extinction or serious injury of the Yarkand trade
would, of course, be a very regrettable circumstance. On the
other hand from my personal knowledge as Deputy Commissioner of
the Dera · Ismail Khan District, I would say no harm would
accrue to general trade on the western border from the
prohibition of churns.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Mr. Coldstream. Deputy Commissioner (5), </i>though he does
not seem to have formed a definite opinion regarding the moderate
use of the drugs, says: &quot;The <i>gradual </i>stoppage of
import of ganja and charas might be tried. It is not as yet a
very widely-spread habit, but it might grow. It would cause gent
pain and discontent if the prohibition were sudden and
comprehensive, but this would not amount to political danger. A
prohibitory measure regarding ganja and charas would no doubt be
followed at once by a recourse to opium and alcohol. I can quite
believe the moderate occasional use of the drugs may be
comparatively harmless, but I am not aware that they are commonly
used occasionally and in moderation. They may, however, be so
used for all I know.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Mr. Wilson, Deputy Commissioner (14), </i>says that he
should like to see the experiment made in selected districts of
prohibiting trade in charas (and bhang) all together. As regards
charas, he thinks the prohibition would be feasible, as it is
imported, and the discontent would be insignificant. knows of no
class, such as labourers, who take the drug in moderation as an
ordinary stimulant. Among fakirs and other excessive consumers,
he thinks the use produces great evils, and that there is no more
harmful drug which they are likely to take to. He does not know
anything of the use of dhatura except its administration as a
poison. He thinks sudden prohibition would be cruel. He would
therefore begin by taxation and gradually raise it, leaving the
question of total prohibition to be decided by experience. The
evidence of <i>Arjan Singh, Extra Assistant Commissioner </i>(19),
is much to the same effect, but he states that the use of dhatura
is general among the followers of Siva at the Shivratri in the
Dera Ghazi Khan district. He says it is taken in very small
quantities, so that its effect is almost imperceptible. <i>General
Millet (69), </i>formerly District Superintendent of Police,
would like to see all intoxicants prohibited which cannot be
proved to be actually necessary. He thinks gradual prohibition of
the hemp drugs feasible, and that educated, intelligent native
public opinion, which to a great extent leads that of the lower
classes, would support prohibition. Discontent at first among the
degraded classes would be inevitable, but there would be no
political danger, though tact and discretion would be needed and
calm-minded European officials at the helm. He fears that
recourse to alcohol would be the result. <i>Shekh Riaz Husain,
zamindar (67), </i>thinks that &quot;having regard for the
welfare and good of the people which the British Government has
in view, the prohibition of the hemp drugs (including bhang) is
imperatively necessary. Loyal and intelligent subjects and
well-wishers of the country would welcome the prohibition, though
the unscrupulous habitual consumers would indeed dislike it. But
as it would be for the good of the people, it is not hoped that
any class of persons would resent it. The enforcement of the
prohibition should be effected like other new laws and
regulations, exceptions being made to some extent in the case of
the existing old habitual consumers, because its sudden stoppage
would cause them serious privation. The discontent resulting
would not amount to a political danger. If it were possible to
make charas as expensive as alcohol, that would be one way of
dealing with the subject.&quot;<i>Sardar Sujan Singh, Rai
Bahadur, Contractor (59), </i>considers charas as certainly most
injurious, and thinks its use should most certainly be
prohibited. It does no good to anybody. There are not many <i>kahars
</i>who take it. Those who do, go to the bad. He does not know of
the use. of dhatura as an intoxicant. The use of madak and chandu
is more injurious than charas, and they also should be prohibited
as well as liquor. He would not recommend immediate prohibition,
but would put on such a tax, increasing it gradually, as to make
it impossible for the majority of people to buy them at all.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Dr. H. M. Clark, Missionary (46), </i>would like to see
charas prohibited if it were possible, He thinks. however, that
alcohol does more harm than charas. He cannot believe that a
moderate use of charas is possible. Fakirs and devotees are the
chief consumers. <i>Devi Dayal, Editor of the Kaitistha Mitra,*
Lahore, </i>circulation 300 copies (83), says: &quot;If charas be
called poison (fatal, killing, murdering drug), it is not an
exaggeration of any kind. It is a great vice to smoke charas. May
God not give this even in the lot of a foe. Only just people as
have bad luck get engaged in this vice. Government will do their
subjects a very great obligation by saving them from early death
and whirlpool of destruction and ruin. My present belief is that
there is no such thing as moderation in the use of chards,
because, when a c<i>harsi </i>visits another, he offers him the c<i>hillum,
</i>and they smoke in company. The smoke is thus repeated
frequently.&quot; Consumers acknowledge that they would have no
complaint; and if Government were to prohibit the use of charas
to-morrow, the bad habit would die out of itself. <i>Ganesh Das,
Pleader, and President, Sarin Sabha, Hoshiarpur </i>(77): Charas
jogis, sanyasis, and suthra fakirs, andis consumed by shoemakers,
musicians, by some Khatris and Brahmins. The physical effects are
very bad, and most consumers become incapacitated for work and
lead a miserable life. The subcommittee of the Sarin Sabha
appointed to consider the subject recommend prohibition. Enquiry
was not made from medical experts. Consumers would not take to
other intoxicants, because the intoxication of chards is not like
that of opium or other intoxicants. The greatest loss would be
that of the traders of Hoshiarpur and Amritsar, who take
merchandise to Ladakh and Yarkand and bring back charas.<br>

<p>580. The Madras witnesses in favour of prohibition are a Civil
Surgeon, a subordinate civil officer, a medical practitioner, a
Hindu priest, and six missionaries. Dr. King, (85) says-
&quot;The restriction of the sale of ganja under conditions
similar to those required for poisonous drugs in Great Britain
would be an unqualified blessing to the country, thus contrasting
with the action taken against agitation which I believe to be
unnecessary and mischievous. I consider special measures should
be taken to restrain the use of ganja by sepoys, and especially
to prevent the young sepoy from acquiring the habit&quot; In oral
examination however, Dr. King, stated as follows- &quot;My
opinion of the effect of the moderate use in impairing the moral
sense and inducing laziness, etc., is a general impression and
not based on actual observation. My impression is based on the
fact that persons alleged to have been ganja smokers have
presented these characteristics. They were pointed out as
notorious ganja smokers. I did not discriminate in these cases
between the moderate and excessive use.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>Synd Mahmud(I22) </i>says: &quot;It<i> </i>is an
unquestionable fact that ganja, bhang, and charas are poisons,
and this fact is admitted by all. In my opinion their suppression
would be an act of virtue deserving of future reward, but it is
not advisable to suppress their use at once. Its suppression
should be regulated under certain rules without any loss to the
State. To the best of my knowledge and researches, alcohol cannot
be safely used as a substitute for ganja, charas, and
bhang.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p><i>Rev. Mr. Laflamme </i>(153) speaking on behalf of the
Baptist Missionary Conferences of the Presidency, advocates
prohibition in these terms: &quot;Owing to the scarcity of shops
in these parts practical prohibition exists. Much that is
consumed is consumed illicitly. The introduction of the license
system Seems to have had no appreciable effect on the use of the
drugs. The ganja is nearly all grown by the consumers in their
own yards.&quot; &quot;The drugs should all be so safeguarded as
to prevent or minimize any possible harm resulting from their
abuse.&quot; &quot;The<i> </i>general sense of the people is
opposed to the use of the drugs.&quot; So far as the witness can
gather, the members of the Mission are. united in the belief that
in these parts hemp drugs are far less injurious than opium and
alcohol; thus far that the latter are not only much more
extensively used, but much more baleful in, their effects. Two
other missionaries, though neutral in opinion, are worth quoting <i>Rev.
Mr. Pittendrigh Missionary (160) </i>says that he would have
ultimate prohibition in view if possible, but there is not much
ground for special interference in anything that he has seen.
Another Missionary, the <i>Rev. Mr. Goffin. </i>(145), cannot
undertake to criticise the present or any system of exise
administration. His impression is that Government would be wise
to adopt strictly &quot;let-alone&quot; policy, leaving it to the
spread of education and enlightenment among the people to prevent
and lessen all its effects. The province government should be
carefully to watch such effects, and wherever and whenever
necessary interfere with prohibitive legislation. Such necessity,
however, in his opinion would not often occur.<br>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition</b> </p>

<p>581. Among those who are opposed to prohibition, the evidence
of the following witnesses may be quoted :--<br>
</p>

<p><i>(1) Prohibition impossible or unnecessary, or could not be
enforced without a large preventive establishment.</i> </p>

<p>(1) Hon'ble C. S. Crole, Member, Board. of Revenue.(8) Mr.

<p><b>Bombay. Opinions in favour of prohibition of ganja.</b> </p>

<p>582. For the prohibition of ganja or charas in Bombay and
Sind, we have the following advocates: in Bombay two mamlatdars,
a hospital assistant, and a medical practitioner; and in Sind a
health officer, two hospital assistants, and a. banker. There is
not much that need be quoted from the evidence of these
witnesses. It may be noted that the Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie,
Commissioner of Abkari, etc. (1), holds that the policy of
Government in relation to the hemp drugs should be one of
restriction, as far as restriction, 'is possible, and that, if
absolute prohibition were possible, he thinks it would be a good
thing. Owing, however, to the fact that the territories of the
Bombay Presidency interlace so extensively with foreign
territory, and to the feeling which would be aroused among the
consumers and those who sympathize with them, it would in his
opinion be impossible or undesirable. The Secretary to the Arya
Samaj in Bombay (109) states that while fully sympathising with
the objects of the Commission, which are apparently understood to
be the restriction or prohibition of the drugs, the Arya Samaj
&quot;is of opinion that any Governmental action in the direction
of further restricting the preparation and sale of the drug will
be productive of very little good. The <b>' </b>* Samaj believes
that education of the masses is the only proper and effective .
remedy for correcting such baneful habits, and fears that any
compulsion in<b> </b>this matter is likely to drive the consumers
of these comparatively innoccuous drugs to the use. of more
injurious intoxicants that are plentifully supplied to the people
like the various preparations containing alcohol.&quot; The
Samaj.prays that the Government will devise measures for the
restriction of the sale of European liquor in India. and leave
the hemp drugs to themselves. The only<b> </b>thorough advocate
of prohibition whose opinion is worth specifying is Rao
SahibShesho Krisna Madkavi (41), who considers-such prohibition
very necessary and holds that, although there would be temporary
discontent among the consumers such discontent would not amount
to a political danger &quot;the<i> </i>people in this part of the
country being loyal and of mild nature. and the proportion of the
persons using bhang and ganja to the general population being too
small to be taken into consideration.&quot; <br>
</p>

<p><b>Opinions against prohibition</b> </p>

<p>583. On the other hand, the opinions against prohibition are
weighty. The following may be specially quoted:<br>
</p>

<p><i>(1) Prohibition impossible or unnecessary, or could not be
enforced without a large preventive establishment. Bombay</i> </p>

<p>(1) Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie, Commissioner of Abkari, etc (3)
Mr. Vidal, Chief Secretary to Government. (10) Mr. Monteath,
CoIlector. (12) Mr. Cumine, Acting Collector. (53) Mr. Vincent,
C.I.E., officiating commissioner of Police. (110) Rai Bahadur
Vishvanath Keshava Joglekar, Merchant. (108) Daji Abaji Khare,
Honorary Secretary, East Indian Association. </p>

<p><i>Sind </i></p>

<p>(1) Mr. James, Commissioner in Sind. (26) Seth Vishindas
Nihalchand, Zamindar and Merchant. <br>
</p>

<p><i>(2) Prohibition would be strongly resented by religious
mendicants, or would be regarded as an interference with
religion, or would be likely to become a political danger.<br>
</i></p>

<p><i>Bombay. </i></p>

<p>(l) Hon'ble T. D. Mackenzie, Commissioner of Abkari, etc. (2)
Mr. Reid, Commissioner ganja. Apart from all this, there is
another consideration which has been urged in some quarters with
a manifestation of strong feeling, and to which the Commission
are disposed to attach some importance, <i>viz.</i>, that to
repress the drugs in India and to leave alcohol alone would be
misunderstood by a large number of persons who believe, and
apparently not without reason, that more harm is done in this
country by the latter than by the former. The conclusion of the
Commission regarding bhang has been given in paragraph 564; under
all the circumstances they now unhesitatingly give their verdict
against such a violent measure as total prohibition in respect of
any of the hemp drugs.<br>
</p>

<p><b>II. The policy advocated is one of control and restriction
aimed at suppressing the excessive use and restraining the
moderate use within due limits (Chapter XlV, paragraph 586) <br>
</b></p>

<p><b>Policy in regard to hemp drugs.</b> </p>

<p><tt>586 </tt>Failing prohibition, the question arises, what
should be the policy of the Policy in regard to hemp drugs.
Government in regard to the hemp drugs? On this point some
important evidence has been recorded, and the Commission deem it
to be within the scope of their duty to state in general terms
their own conclusions. In the first place, then, they are of
opinion that in view of the harmful effects produced by the
excessive use, and in exceptional cases even by the moderate use,
of the drugs, the action of the Government should be directed
towards restraining the former and avoiding all encouragement to
the latter. The object should be to prevent the consumers, as far
as may be possible, from doing harm to themselves and to lessen
the inducements to the formation of the habit which might lead to
such harm In aiming at this object, however, other considerations
need to be kept in view. There is in the first place the question
of illicit consumption. If the restriction. imposed by Government
is counterbalanced by a corresponding increase in smuggling no
advantage is gained but, on the contrary, a moral wrong is done
to the community apart from the annoyance necessitated by such
restrictions. Than, if there is a legitimate use of the drugs,
restrictions should not be such as to make the exercise of this
use impossible. The Commission have formed the opinion that there
is a legitimate use of the hemp drugs, and that it exists
generally among the poorest of the population. Again, if the
restrictions lead to the use of more deleterious substances, or
even drive the people from a habit the evil of which is known to
another of which the evil maybe greater, they are no longer
justifiable. The policy of Government must be tempered by all
these considerations, and the neglect of any one of them may lead
to serious error. <br>
