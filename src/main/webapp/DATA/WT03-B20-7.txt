<H1>The economics of  risk 
avoidance<BR>
under uncertainty</H1>
<HR>
<B>Scientists are not yet certain just how the climate will respond to increasing 
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs).</B>  Their best estimate is 
that current GHG emissions trends will cause the global average temperature to increase 
by 1.5-4.5 C over the next 100 years and the global average sea level to rise by 3-10 cm 
per decade.  Scientists have significantly less confidence in regional or national climate 
forecasts. Other uncertainties include future population and economic growth rates and 
how these rates will impact future GHG emissions levels.  What's more, since the majority 
of studies that assess the likely impacts of climate change take the doubling of carbon 
dioxide (CO2) concentrations as their benchmark scenario, little information exists on the 
likely scale of damages either before or - more importantly - after this doubling occurs.  
As a result, there is a great deal of uncertainty about how great the risks of climate change 
truly are.<P>
<B>Economists recognise that people dislike uncertainty and tend to be risk averse . 
. . </B> People are often willing to exchange a risky asset with a high expected return for 
an asset with a lower, yet more certain rate of return. For example, suppose a lottery 
winner is given a choice between receiving a certain prize of $450,000 and selecting one 
of two identical envelopes.  One envelope contains a prize of $1 million and the other is 
empty, making the expected payoff to the gamble $500,000 ([$1 million x 0.5] + [$0 x 
0.5]).  This is higher than the certain payoff, but most people would, of course, prefer to 
take the certain $450,000 prize.  By comparison, a "risk neutral individual" would be 
someone who cares only about the expected outcome and would thus choose to open an 
envelope.<P>
<B>but economic analysis that treats climate change as if it were a problem 
involving perfect certainty does offer valuable insights. </B> One of the most useful 
services economists could render to policy-makers would be to calculate the optimal level 
of GHG emissions, given the costs and benefits of making emissions reductions.  To make 
the necessary calculations for such a cost-benefit analysis, economists usually assign 
definite values to uncertain parameters such as climate sensitivity.  They use the expected, 
or most likely, values. This allows economists to offer some insights, but it does lead to 
treating the problem as if it were one of perfect certainty.  An analysis that ignores 
uncertainty could lend support to policies that would be appropriate for society "on 
average".  They might not, however, reflect the interest that individuals would have in 
avoiding extreme consequences, even if there is a low probability that they would occur.  
Critics therefore argue that people would probably want to make even larger cutbacks in 
GHG emissions than suggested by cost-benefit analyses to avoid this high risk.<P>
<B>Improving the treatment of risk in cost-benefit analyses requires making much 
more complex calculations.</B> Few economists have attempted to do this.  They 
would have to describe variations in key parameters mathematically - for example, to say 
that there is a 95% probability that climate sensitivity lies between two particular values. 
Scientists, however, are generally reluctant to make such statements.  Furthermore, some 
risks are inherently  unquantifiable, and economists have no widely accepted method for 
dealing with such risks.<P>
<B>Research that would reduce climate change uncertainties would be extremely 
valuable for policy-making.</B>  By calculating how much it would be worth paying to 
get immediate, perfect information about key uncertainties, economists can provide a 
strong argument for greatly increased research budgets.  If cost-benefit analyses could be 
based on perfect information, we could more easily avoid restricting emissions 
unnecessarily in the event that global warming involves low risks, or cut back further on 
excessive emissions if the climate is acutely sensitive to greenhouse gas emissions.  One 
study1 calculates that the value of perfect information regarding climate sensitivity is an 
impressive US$148 billion.  However, not only does scientific research seldom provide 
perfect information, but some scientific improvements must await the passage of time and 
cannot simply be bought.  Some economists even speculate that permitting a small amount 
of global warming to occur would provide scientific information that is more valuable than 
the damage associated with the warming (although given the predictions of climate change 
models that some climate change seems inevitable, there would seem to be little or nothing 
to gain from postponing abatement). On the other hand, because the expected value of 
perfect information is high, there is a good argument for substantial funding for scientific 
research.<P>
<B>Because the greenhouse problem is so full of uncertainties, policy-making will 
remain relatively subjective.</B>  Some people argue that society should adopt a 
"maxi-mini' approach to decision-making.  This approach of maximising the minimum 
payoff suggests that we should prepare for the worst possible outcome irrespective of the 
cost and no matter how unlikely this eventuality is.  This is not, of course, very typical 
real-life behaviour.  An alternative proposal is to regard some rate of warming, such as 
0.1o C per decade, as the maximum acceptable and to set an emissions ceiling for GHGs 
to guarantee that such a rate is not exceeded.  This is based on the argument that it will 
remain impossible to quantify the climatic risks of surpassing either a rate of warming or 
an absolute temperature that is greater than what has been recorded in the earth's recent 
history.  The truth of this argument, too, is hotly debated.  For economists, the challenge 
remains to develop policy prescriptions that take into account current scientific 
uncertainties.<P>
