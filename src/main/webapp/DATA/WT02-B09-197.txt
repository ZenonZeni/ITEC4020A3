<p> Armed with a firm understanding that the law is dynamic and that if a client is to be
successfully represented, a lawyer must not only have a full working knowledge of yesterday's decisions but the
work ethic to gather the relevant facts and the judgment and intuition to marshal those facts such that
the law is favorably applied to our client's current and future issues and problems, the firm of Ford Marrin Esposito
Witmeyer & Gleser, L.L.P. was founded in 1976.  From its outset, the Firm has concentrated its efforts
on the representation of clients with complex business problems requiring creative solutions. </p>

<p> The Firm has steadily grown over the last two decades and now numbers twenty-five
lawyers. The Firm achieved its expansion entirely by internal growth, resisting trends to expand by acquisition
of practice groups, believing that to do so would result in a deterioration of professionalism, quality
control and team work, the three pillars upon which effective client representation must stand.  The
Firm has a world-wide  reputation, representing both national and international clients throughout the
United States and is one of the few firms of its size that does. </p>

<p> This site illustrates the types of services we most frequently
provide to our clients.  The Firm's practice encompasses the broad range of legal representation needed
by clients. </p>
