<STRONG>A Time-Tested, Disciplined Approach To Sound Investing</STRONG>
<P>

If you are looking for an investment strategy that offers simplicity, with a
long-term
approach, this
technique may be right for you.<P>
Choosing an investment strategy that suits you is never easy. You face a myriad of
tough
questions,
including:<P>
<UL>
<LI>How much money should I invest?
<LI>How often should I invest? 
<LI>Where should I invest my money? 
</UL>
<P>
Fortunately, there's a venerable investment strategy that could be the answer to
many of your
concerns.
It's called Dollar Cost Averaging, and it can simplify your investment planning.
<P>

The name may sound complicated but, simply put, Dollar Cost Averaging is nothing
more than
the
systematic investment of a fixed dollar amount at regular time intervals. For
example, you
could invest
$100 every week. Or $500 every month. Or $1,000 every three months. The amount
and
frequency
of
your investments depends upon your financial means and long-term goals. However,
once you
initiate
the plan, the key to success is sticking with it and ignoring market fluctuations.
<P>
<STRONG>How Does Dollar Cost Averaging Work?</STRONG><BR>
Basically, Dollar Cost Averaging attempts to take the ups and downs of the market
and "smooth
them
out." Instead of trying to time the highs and lows (a daunting task, even for
professionals),
you're
investing the same amount of money at regular intervals. Dollar Cost Averaging
encourages a
systematic approach to investing that frees you from trying to time the market.
Let's take a
look at how a
Dollar Cost Averaging program would work under three hypothetical market
environments:
fluctuating,
rising, and declining.
<P>
<STRONG>Dollar Cost Averaging in Turbulent Times</STRONG><BR>
Let's assume you decide to put $100 every month in an investment that is currently
selling
for $10 per
share. (For this hypothetical example, let's assume that there are no additional
charges).
The first
month you invest $100 and receive 10 shares. Then, in an extreme but easy to
follow
example,
the
market falls and the price drops to $5 per share. In the second month your $100
buys you 20
shares.
The market rebounds in the following month, the price jumps to $10 per share, and
for your
$100
investment you receive 10 shares. Let's see where you would stand:

Average Share Cost To You: $7.50 ($300&#247;40)<BR>
Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $8.33 ($25&#247;3)
<P>
As you can see, you now own 40 shares after a total investment of $300. The
average
price is
$8.33,
but the average cost to you was $7.50. Being disciplined and remaining with the
program is
the key to
the long-term success of Dollar Cost Averaging. 
<P>
<STRONG>In Good Times...</STRONG><BR>
Let's say you continue with your investment program, and the market rallies. Your
investment
rises to
$20, then $25, and eventually $50 per share. Let's see where you stand.<P>

Average Share Cost To You: $27.27 ($300&#247;411)<BR>
Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $31.67 ($95&#247;3)
<P>
When the market rises, you benefit in two ways: the value of your total investment
increases
(obviously),
and the average cost you paid is lower than the average share price (not so
obvious, but
true). When
you compare the average share price ($31.67) to what you actually paid ($27.27),
you can
appreciate
the benefits of Dollar Cost Averaging.
<P>
<STRONG>...And In Bad</STRONG><BR>
It's tough to find a silver lining in the dark cloud of a declining market, but
through the
consistency of
Dollar Cost Averaging, you can take some consolation. Let's assume the market
begins to slide
and
the price drops to $25, then $20 and eventually $10 per share.

<P>
Average Share Cost To You: $15.79 ($300&#247;19)<BR>
Average Share Price Over 3 Months: $18.33 ($55&#247;3)
<P>
Here, when the share price fell from $25 to $10 you were able to purchase the
greatest number
of
shares. In addition, your average share cost ($15.79) was less than the average
share price.
Because
you invested a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals, ignoring the price
fluctuations, you
were able to
purchase a larger number of shares when the price was low and  a smaller number of
shares
when
the price was high. In effect, you are buying a lot at bargain prices, and
relatively little
at what might be
considered exorbitantly high prices.
<P>
<STRONG>No Guarantees in Life</STRONG><BR>
As illustrated in the "declining market" example, Dollar Cost Averaging does not
guarantee a
profit nor
protect against loss. If you have to "sell low," no system is going to give you a
gain. It's
every investors
dream to "beat the market," but unfortunately there are no magic methods that can
guarantee
that.
However, a Dollar Cost Averaging plan can offer a disciplined, systematic approach
to
investing, that
could be the cornerstone of your long-term planning. Since such plans involve
continuous
investment in
securities regardless of fluctuating price levels, you should consider your
financial ability
to continue
making purchases during periods of low price levels.
<P>
<STRONG>Setting Up a Dollar Cost Averaging Plan</STRONG><BR>
While Dollar Cost Averaging may simplify the questions "How much?" and "How often?"
you
should
invest, before you can enjoy the benefits of this program you must first answer the
question,
"Where
should I invest?" Investing in variable products is a popular way to utilize Dollar
Cost
Averaging.
Vehicles such as mutual funds, variable annuities, and variable universal life
insurance
offer
investment flexibility and convenience. You can set up a customized program where
you invest
a fixed
amount at regular time intervals into a variable product. Your regular investments
can be
made by
simply writing checks, or you can take advantage of the convenience of bank
drafting. With
this method,
automatic payments are withdrawn from your bank savings or checking account to
purchase
shares on
a regular basis.
