<BODY>
<h1>Australian Graduate School of Engineering Innovation (AGSEI)</h1>
<b>AGSEI</b> is a national Advanced Engineering Centre promoting an
engineering culture which brings together technology, management and
marketing, with an overall focus on wealth creation and the
introduction of a more effective process of engineering innovation to
Australian industry.  AGSEI has been formed jointly by the Engineering
Faculties of the University of Sydney and the University of Technology,
Sydney, and is
<A HREF=atpmap>located</A> separately from both of them. Its objectives
are:
<ul>
<li>to ensure that today's engineers, as well as those of tomorrow, are
better equipped to take leadership roles in assuring the success of
industrial enterprises;
<li>to educate engineers and others to think and contribute across
disciplines in a corporate environment;
<li>to demonstrate the central role of innovation in achieving
competitive advantage;
<li>to provide industry with convenient access to national and
international best practice in engineering management and the
application of technology;
<li>to enhance the capability to commercialise new technology and the
results of research and development;
<li>to foster the creation of new industry through technology transfer
and the introduction of appropriate management systems;
<li>to raise understanding in the professions and society of the role
of industry, technology and engineering in the creation of national wealth;
<li>to educate engineers to understand and contribute to enterprise
management, and to educate executive managements to understand and
utilise their engineering capability more effectively.
</ul>
<h4>Students</h4>
Initially programs are being structured for engineers and other
professionals who have been in industry for two to three years after
completing their bachelors degree. Later programs will be developed for
undergraduate courses.
<h4>The programs</h4>
AGSEI offers an array of courses centring on:
<ul>
<li>Engineering Management
<li>Engineering Innovation
<li>Industrial Systems Engineering
</ul>
The programs cover topics in:
<ul>
<li>quality
<li>innovation
<li>technology
<li>systems engineering
<li>information technology and management
<li>computer-aided engineering and logistic support
<li>human resources and change management
<li>professional and business ethics
<li>design and documentation
<li>manufacturing
<li>government
<li>economics
<li>marketing
<li>finance
<li>law
</ul>
The approach taken is distinctly different from that of an MBA. The MBA
programs teach generic management, regardless of what is being managed.
AGSEI builds specifically on the capability of <i>engineers</i>, and is
wholly about organisation and application of engineering effort to
innovation and business performance - <i> total engineering</i>, not
total management.
<h4>Modules</h4>
The basic program element is the module, typically offered over one
week and involving intensive material presentation plus workshop and
project sessions. Modules may be aggregated, by those who wish
to do so, to lead to formal awards at several levels such as graduate
certificate or masters degree. Modules will have the following
characteristics:
<ul>
<li>All modules will be available in stand-alone form, designed
expressly to meet the needs of engineers and engineering enterprises.
<li>All programs require the course content to be trialled in industry,
with advice from AGSEI staff, and (where possible) the results to be
reported and discussed in workshop sessions.
<li>Heavy use is made of industry-based project work.
<li>Wherever possible, modules involve group interaction, normally
multi-disciplinary. AGSEI acts not only as a teaching and advisory
resource but as a framework in which participants (engineers and other
professionals who deal with engineers) learn from each other and from
inter-organisation contacts.
</ul>
