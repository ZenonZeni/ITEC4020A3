<P ALIGN=Left><B>A.	INTRODUCTION</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>Increasing complaints by non-farm dwellers are creating a serious
problem for intensive livestock production facilities.  These complaints
arise from concerns about the odour and the potential for environmental problems,
and could prevent the establishment of new production units or the expansion
of existing units.  The future growth of the livestock industry is at risk
due to this problem.  In particular, the hog industry currently faces the
greatest pressures.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Company Analysis</B>: 
<P ALIGN=Left>P.M.G. AGRI TECH was formed in the spring of 1995 by Mr. Jerry
Sorokowski as a vehicle to develop a vertically integrated hog production
industry utilizing innovative, commercially viable and ecologically sustainable
solutions to the waste management problems of intensive livestock operations.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Business Profile</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>Phase 1 of P.M.G. AGRI TECH'S vertical integration expansion
is aimed at a coordinated sow supply and hog finishing operation.  The scale
of achieving proper capacity utilization has been determined as follows:
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183; one 5,000 sow barn
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183; eighteen 2,000 hog finishing barns
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183; one small scale meat processing plant.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>Returns in the order of 40% on investment are currently being
achieved in the industry and are projected for this project.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Current Practices</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>The current practice is generally stand alone agricultural
operations with no degree of integration, no economies of scale and negotiated
supply subject to market fluctuations.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>B.	TREND ANALYSIS</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Industry</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>Industrial reorganization is playing a significant role in
the new structure of the international pork industry.  Global trends suggest
there will be fewer, larger, and more specialized production units and processors
with large-scale kill-floors.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>Primary hog production across North America has undergone change
in the past fifteen years.  As with most aspects of agriculture, hog production
is becoming more and more concentrated with fewer, larger producers.  In
Manitoba, for example, 23.5% of producers were responsible for 80.5% of all
hogs produced, with 4.9% of hog farms producing 44.7%.  Over the past 15
years, the number of hogs produced has risen from 1 million to over 2.3 million
per year while the number of individual producers has declined significantly.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>In the United States the pork industry is attracting companies
backed by large banks and investment capital.  These companies' operations
are fully integrated &endash; from the barns and production to the processing
plants and retail outlets.  It is estimated that 50 percent of hog production
in the USA will be integrated under processor control by the turn of the
century.  This indicates that economies of scale are an important consideration
to competitive hog production, packing and processing.  The following are
further indicators of these trends in the United States:
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	500 sows is considered a small farm,
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	fully integrated operations in North and South Carolina,
Missouri, Iowa and other states,
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	development of mega hog farms in mid-western states,
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	growing contractual relations between producers, feed
companies, and packers, and 
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	relocation of pork processing firms (and associated
production) to states with minimum environmental regulations and requirements.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>In general, the commercial character of the US Industry is
being shaped by numerically small, but commercially very large producers
and processors.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>However, environmental issues in some countries are already
acting as constraints to the pork industry.  Taiwan, a country that exports
4 million hogs per year, will be cutting its exports, in part, for environmental
reasons.  The Netherlands, a strong competitor in the pork industry, is
constrained by a lack of land area for its manure disposal, and similar
challenges are faced by Belgium.  In Manitoba, applications for the construction
of new hog barns have been denied zoning approval, due to concerns about
odour and water contamination.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Ecological</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>A high concentration of hogs in a single location brings with
it real and perceived environmental and aesthetic difficulties.  These concerns
limit the establishment and operation of large hog production units.  The
Manitoba Pork Study Committee Report indicates that without a satisfactory
solution to the problems of manure management associated with these large
units, intensive hog operations cannot be considered sustainable development.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>The odours produced from hog housing facilities, manure storage
and land spreading of manure are of concern in England, the Netherlands,
Denmark as well as Manitoba according to the report of the Manitoba Manure
Technology Transfer Mission.  
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>In the Netherlands, concern about acid rain and the impact
of ammonia emissions from manure is very high.  Mission countries are conducting
considerable research and monitoring of the greenhouse gases, methane and
nitrous oxide, emitted by manure.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>High nitrate levels in groundwater are a serious concern in
all three Mission countries.  As well, there is general concern in Manitoba
about any mineral excess in the environment and diligence is required to
ensure that nitrate levels remain within acceptable limits.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>Furthermore, manure can cause pollution of surface water when
runoff from manured fields, solid storage areas and livestock pens enters
watercourses.  This surface water contamination can be due to excessive nitrogen,
phosphorus or micro-organisms entering the water.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Sociological</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>Odour is a major issue raised in some communities regarding
the development of new hog enterprises.  Manitoba Agriculture states that
"odours are one of the main causes of conflicts between livestock producers
and their neighbours."  In a telephone survey of rural residents, conducted
by Decision Research Inc. for Saskatoon's Agriculture 2000, the primary concern
about large hog operations was odour, with concern about the protection of
the aquifer running second.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>Odours are produced by the anaerobic decomposition of the manure,
most of which occurs while the manure is in storage.  The two main sources
of odours are open liquid manure storages and liquid manure that is spread
on fields.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Technological</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>While the problem of agricultural waste has been identified,
the solution, to date, is to deal with the problem by controlling it rather
than resolving it.  In its Farm Practices Guidelines, Manitoba Agriculture
devotes little space to alternative methods of manure management and deals
almost exclusively with liquid manure handling techniques, recommendations
and regulations.  It is clear that as yet Manitoba Agriculture has not identified
viable alternatives.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Economic</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>There is a strong correlation between income and meat consumption.
 It follows that strong economic growth in developing countries is leading
to higher per capita meat consumption.  In particular, consumption of pork
products around the world is increasing, with the world consumption of pork
equaling 68.8 million tonnes in 1993.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Legal</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>Water contamination is an environmental and a health concern.
 The pollution of water, either surface or underground is illegal in many
locals.  Water pollution is regulated under The Public Health Act and the
Environment Act.  Manitoba Environment is assigned the responsibility to
prevent, monitor and assess water pollution and to prosecute violators when
necessary.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>The environmental issue relative to the financing of hog barns
and operations is similar to that of potentially contaminated sites for other
industries. Lending institutions are not prepared to accept the possibility
that they may be liable for clean-up costs of an environmental accident at
a hog barn location.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Political </B>
<P ALIGN=Left>A challenge to industry and agri-businesses in Manitoba is
clearly identified in the Report to the Government of Manitoba prepared by
the Manitoba Pork Study committee in August, 1994 titled "Manitoba's Pork
Industry: Building for the 21st Century".  The challenge from government
is to double pork processing and hog production in Manitoba by the year 2000.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>The Province of Manitoba is a leader in finding and developing
innovative ways to encourage sustainable development in all sectors.  The
Premier's Round Table on the Environment and the Economy and the International
Institute for Sustainable Development in Winnipeg are two indicators that
development can no longer stand alone but must be considered in the context
of its effects on others and on the environment.  By locating in Manitoba,
P.M.G. AGRI TECH should be well positioned to benefit from this positive
political climate.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Regulatory</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>In many hog producing countries, surface and groundwater
contamination resulting from hog lagoon breaks and overflows is leading to
a trend towards greater regulation of livestock manure management.  There
are numerous indicators of this trend, of which the following are several
examples.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
environmental committee is working  to establish new principles and codes
of practice which will have major implications for the harmonization of
appropriate environmental policies and practices for hog production.  One
can anticipate economic penalties built into the GATT trade rules for suppliers
of pork where the cost of production is significantly reduced at the expense
of the environment.  
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	In North Carolina, after the summer of 1995, which "will
be remembered as a disaster for the state's swine industry" because of a
number of serious hog lagoon spills, "top officials are daring to suggest
that large hog farms aren't really farms, but industrial operations that
should be regulated as such." 
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	Manitoba Agriculture has developed "Farm Practises
Guidelines for Hog Producers in Manitoba."  In these guidelines, Manitoba
Agriculture states that "the viability of the livestock industry is dependent
on the sustainability of the environment."   As well, it predicts that there
will be increasing pressure to closely regulate hog operations.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>&#183;	The Manitoba Pork Study Committee in its "Recommendations
for Sustainable Development" gives a strong mandate for action in addressing
the problem of liquid manure.  The relevant items are:
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>8.	That guidelines and regulation be continually monitored
to ensure that the latest technology improvements are applied to new industry
development, whether by expansion or new project start-ups.
<P ALIGN=Left>9.	That research and development of new by-product management
systems be encouraged.  There will be opportunities to sell this technology
to competing hog producing countries that have more intensive hog farming
and even greater environmental needs than Manitoba.
<P ALIGN=Left>10.	That the Manitoba Agricultural Services Coordinating Committee
ensure effective processes, including the establishment of dedicated
subcommittees if necessary, to proactively address the issues of sustainable
production efficiencies and innovative waste management technologies for
the pork industries.  These processes must ensure appropriate participation
of industry representatives. 
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>C.	OPPORTUNITIES, THREATS AND ISSUES</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Opportunities</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>In Manitoba, the political will to promote a doubling of the
hog industry, combined with the economic, legal, technological, sociological,
ecological and regulatory trends explored above, and the political desire
to promote exportable technologies provides a substantial opportunity for
a well managed and coordinated vertically integrated operation.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Threats</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>There are two primary threats to P.M.G. AGRI TECH'S ability
to capitalize on the opportunity described above.  Firstly, it is possible
that the market growth projected will not be attained.  Secondly, there is
the possibility that, even if the market growth is attained, that the prices
will be insufficient to yeild a good return on investment.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Issues</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>Given the problems identified above, the substantial opportunity
available and the moderate to small threats, the key issue becomes the
successful, timely, properly financed management of the vertically integrated
concept.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>D.	BUSINESS ACTION PLAN</B>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>The implementation of P.M.G. AGRI TECH'S business strategy
will consist of two components which will be pursued concurrently:
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>1)	The company will secure financing in the amount of $25 million
CDN. to enable it to proceed with the project.
<P ALIGN=Left>2)	The planned project, physical and implementation, management.
