<P>

Philip Martin studied Labor Economics and Agricultural Economics

at the

<P>

University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he earned a PhD in 1975.

<BR>

<P>

Martin has published extensively on farm labor, labor migration,

economic

<P>

development, and immigration issues. He has testified before Congress

and

<P>

state and local agencies numerous times on these issues, and was

the only

<P>

academic appointed to the 12-member Commission on Agricultural

Workers to

<P>

assess the effects of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of

1986 on US

<P>

farmers and workers. Since 1987, Martin has chaired the WRCC-76,

a group of

<P>

35 researchers from land-grant universities that meets annually

to discuss

<P>

research on the effects of immigration reform on US agriculture.

<BR>

<P>

Martin has been asked to develop practical solutions to complex

and

<P>

controversial migration and labor issues in many countries. Between

1988 and

<P>

1990, he assessed competing predictions of how many Turks might

emigrate if

<P>

Turkey were admitted to the European Union. In 1994, he evaluated

the

<P>

effects of immigration on Malaysia's economy and its labor markets.

In 1995,

<P>

he assessed the effects of the peso devaluation on Mexican migration

to the

<P>

United States.<BR>

<P>

Martin was awarded UCD's Distinguished Public Service award in

1994.<BR>
