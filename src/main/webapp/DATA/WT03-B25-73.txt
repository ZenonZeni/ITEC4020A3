<H1>Large Coating Job Shops</H1>

The results are in, and the shops are bigger and better than ever...<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Several years ago Products Finishing initiated a survey of large 
paint/powder coating job shops. We expected it would generate some interest among our readers. It did. However, we found that the information remained pretty much the same each year, so we changed our survey from annual to biennial. <P>

The survey answers indicate that nearly every company is growing. 
Some have hired more employees, while others have added to their facilities or built additional facilities. For example, MetoKote, headquartered in Lima, Ohio, has built or acquired three new facilities and added 377 workers since the last survey. Industrial Coating Services, Indianapolis, Indiana, has added 80 employees and 145,000 sq ft of space. 
<P> 

To make this year's survey a bit more interesting, we asked what 
the companies/survey respondents would like for Christmas and their 
New Year's resolutions. <P>


Most responded that they would like to see an increase in business or a more profitable new year. Dennis Walters of Acme Finishing in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, said that he would like to see the level of activity for custom coaters to remain strong in the U.S.  Other Christmas wishes were for good employees, less government regulation and painting robots. Several also had special wishes for the health and prosperity of their employees and customers. 


<P>Most of the New Year's resolutions revolved around improving 
the company. Some wanted better communications, such as Sabrina Burkhead of Linetec, Wausau, Wisconsin, who said that she resolved to improve communications within the company, among managers as well as with customers. <P> 

Others, such as Lowell Horwedel of E/M, West Lafayette, Indiana, 
resolved to work on continuing upgrades of the company's facilities 
and personnel. Dennis Walters of Acme Finishing resolved to improve the flexibility of his production equipment and work force to achieve even faster job turnaround time. However, Thomas Segrave of American Coating Technologies in Greenville, North Carolina, said that he has no resolutions. If you have to wait until the New Year it is not worth doing. Do it now! 
<P>
The sidebars in the article highlight each company that responded. If you are or know of a company that should be included, let us know. The Vulcan Group was one we missed in previous surveys. And one can see it belongs in this group of large coating job shops. <B>PF</B>
