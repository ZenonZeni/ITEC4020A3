ORPHAN DRUG LEGISLATION PLANNED FOR EUROPE

STRASBOURG - An orphan drug directive is part of the 1996 legislative
programme which was presented by the European Commission to the
European Parliament in Strasbourg.

Europe is the only major developed market in which there is currently
no governmental encouragement for the development of drugs for rare
diseases.

The US Orphan Drug Act, and its accompanying tax credit of 50 per cent
on research costs for orphan drug development, ended in 1994. In the
previous 10 years, however, more than 100 orphan drugs had been
launched on the US market and almost all orphan drugs available
worldwide have originated in the US.

In Japan, similar legislation has been in effect since 1993 with 29
drugs granted protected orphan drug status to date. Of these, five have
been genetically engineered.

A Task Force on Vaccines and Viral Diseases was launched last year by
European Commissioners for research and for industry, Edith Cresson and
Martin Bangemann (BBN No 113, 1 November 1995, page 7). The Task Force
has consulted with around 80 potential industrial partners, large
industrial organisations and the scientific community, identifying the
need for new vaccines for diseases such as Aids, hepatitis,
tuberculosis and malaria. Clearly such products should fall within the
scope of the proposed Orphan Drug Directive.

Little encouragement to date

Up to the present, there has been little in European legislation to
encourage the development of orphan drugs. Vaccine companies like
Pasteur-Merieux, SmithKline Beecham and Evans Medical will rightly
invest in developments with the best profit outlook.

Certainly there are existing Directives 75/318 and 91/507 which make
possible market authorisations under special circumstances for drugs
where full research information is not yet available, where there may
be ethical problems or because of the rarity of the disease. In
addition, Directive 93/41, which relates to high-technology drugs, has
similar limitations and provides a 10-year period of exclusivity even
in the absence of patent coverage.

None of these, however, provide any financial incentive to encourage
pharmaceutical companies to allocate research and development funds to
relatively small market sectors.

European pharmaceutical organisations are in favour of the idea of
legislation similar to the US Orphan Drug Act providing that it
genuinely provides the necessary stimulus. In the US, the absence of
competition for orphan drugs and the lack of established official
prices have encouraged companies such as Amgen (erythropoietin),
Genentech and Lilly (growth hormone) and the then Wellcome (AZT), to
enter profitably into this restricted sector.

Existing European Union legislation through Directives 75/318, 91/507
and 93/41, lays down the groundwork; European pharmaceutical companies
are now looking to a European Orphan Drug Law to provide the necessary
fillip.

GERMANY LOBBIES EU ON NOVEL FOOD

FRANKFURT - The German consumer watchdog Verbraucherzentrale Hessen
(VZH) and the Hesse ministry of social security have initiated a joint
campaign urging changes to the European Union's Novel Food Directive.

The campaign is aimed at members of the European Parliament who are
requested to support the labelling of all genetically engineered
foodstuffs in the forthcoming consultations on the Directive.

The campaign organisers plan to distribute 30,000 postcards which
citizens will be asked to sign and forward to members of the European
Parliament. In cooperation with the ministry, the consumer organisation
has also targeted 300 MEPs who had "demonstrated inconsistent behaviour
in previous votes on genetic engineering", said Hartmut Koenig of the
VZH.

The Novel Food Directive, which was approved by the EU Council of
Ministers in October 1995, was inadequate, added Mr Koenig, because it
did not take into account consumer demands for a high level of safety
and transparency for genetically engineered food.

Through the campaign, the ministry and the consumer watchdog want to
lobby for the "necessary corrections to be made by the European
Parliament". They demand a broader scope of application of the
declaration which would include all foodstuffs produced using genetic
engineering and also additives and auxiliary substances such as
enzymes.

"The most serious disregard of consumers' interests has taken place on
the issue of novel food labelling", Mr Koenig said. The position of the
Council of Ministers was too vague as it only demanded the declaration
of food which differs significantly from the conventional product. This
term was not being defined precisely enough, he argued.

Barbara Stolterfoht, the Hesse Minister of Social Security, criticised
the German Health Minister, Horst Seehofer: "Unfortunately Minister
Seehofer could not even push through the comprehensive labelling of
novel food within the Council of Ministers. Consumers therefore need to
lobby the members of the European Parliament directly."

The European Parliament is expected to reach a decision on the Novel
Food Directive in March.

HAMBURG SETS UP GENETIC TESTING LAB

HAMBURG - Hamburg in Germany has established a municipal laboratory for
the supervision of genetic engineering experiments.

Following the lead taken by Bavaria, Baden-Wurttemberg and Berlin,
Hamburg becomes the fourth state to open a laboratory of this kind. It
is the first, however, which is suitable to supervise experiments up to
the second highest security level (S3), according to the Hamburg
authorities.

"The new laboratory allows us to check whether researchers are actually
working with the genetically altered organisms they were given
permission for", said Fritz Vahrenholt, Hamburg's senator for the
environment.

BIOTECH PATENTING IN THE  DEVELOPING WORLD

MUNICH - The property rights to biotechnology discoveries made by
pharmaceutical multinationals in developing countries need to be
established and improved.

Pharmaceutical companies which develop new plant and animal varieties,
drugs or chemicals based on genetic resources should share their
profits with the owners of the resources on a mutually agreed basis,
according to Professor Joseph Straus of the Max-Planck-Institute for
international patent, proprietary and competition law in Munich.

To illustrate the argument, Prof Straus points to the first public
agreement between a developing country and a pharmaceuticals company.
It was concluded in 1991 between Merck and the Costa Rican biodiversity
research organisation, INBio. The arrangement involves the cataloguing
of plants and animals in Costa Rica, carried out by INBio, and Merck's
right to screen this inventory for marketable products. The company
made a downpayment of $1 million for this right and will pay further
royalties if it discovers a product.

The international commitment to take part in such agreements is
increasing, Mr Straus believes, following the setting up in 1993 of the
US International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (ICBG) to promote more
such partnerships.

He outlines this view in an article entitled "Biotechnology and
Intellectual Property", published in Legal, Economic and Social
Dimensions of Modern Biotechnology, a new volume in a comprehensive
series on the subject which has now been completely revised. It
addresses readers working in industry, at universities or public
institutions.

Apart from the aspects of patent rights, this latest volume looks at
product development and legal requirements, biotech in a developing
world and public attitudes and political responses towards biotech.

ISRAEL BACKS SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION

JERUSALEM - Scientific collaboration in the Middle East is being
actively pursued as the political climate thaws.

At the end of 1995, UNESCO, together with the Hebrew University,
inaugurated a joint international school for molecular and
microbiology.

Based at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the purpose of the school
is to further cooperation between scientists and universities in the
Middle East, develop programmes for the training of lecturers and
researchers, and establish links between scientists working in
molecular biology, medicine, biotechnology and microbiology worldwide.

In the long run, it is hoped that the school will help to enhance the
state of health of mankind, the provision of food for both humans and
animals, and protect the environment.

At the opening seminar, the lecturers discussed different biotech
activities, joint projects already ongoing between Israel and
Palestine, and the concept of science crossing national borders.

Over the course of three days, the school held sessions given by
international scientists. This was followed by a two-day workshop,
sponsored by UNESCO and Silicon Graphics Biomedical, which included
lectures, demonstrations and hands-on tutorials about computational
analysis.

"The programme is targeted mostly at doctoral students right now",
according to Yechiel Becker, chairman of the Institute of Microbiology
at the Hebrew University, and the founder and director of the
international school. "We plan to offer theoretical and experimental
workshops, teach new techniques and foster good relationships between
researchers. Sharing knowledge and advancements in science will promote
peace by enhancing the understanding and cooperation between peoples in
the Middle East and other parts of the world."

The agreement to create the international school was originally signed
in April 1995. Its theme is "Science for Peace" and it will involve
more than 20 Israeli and Palestinian researchers. Cooperation between
Egypt and Jordan is also expected in the future.

The school will join the UNESCO Global Network for Molecular and Cell
Biology. Funding is primarily from UNESCO, with the Hebrew University
supplying the infrastructure. Other interested agencies and foundations
are welcome to pledge their support.

The curriculum for each 10-day session will focus on a major subject
such as biotech approaches to microbial agents, molecular biological
aspects of parasitic micro-organisms, and molecular immunology of
microbial infections in man and animal. In addition to lectures and
workshops, students will be able to join one of the research teams at
the Institute of Microbiology for the duration of the session. At
present, the budget allows for one or two sessions a year.

ISRAEL AND KOREA SIGN MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING

JERUSALEM - A memorandum of understanding for scientific and
technological cooperation between the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
and the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology
(KRIBB) has been signed by representatives of the two institutions.

The signing took place in Jerusalem attended by Ilan Chet, Hebrew
University vice-president for research and development, and Kwang-Ho
Pyun, president of the KRIBB.

Also present was Hun-Pyo Ha, head of international cooperation and
public relations for KRIBB, Shabtay Dover, director of the Hebrew
University's Authority for Research and Development, and
representatives of the Israel Ministry of Science and the Arts.

The agreement provides for the exchange of faculty members and post-
doctoral students, short-term projects for technical training, joint
study and research activities, and the exchange of scientific and
technical information, such as books, reports and reference materials.

Both sides expressed the hope that a second Israel-Korea biotech
conference would take place in Israel this year. The first conference
was held last year in Seoul.

1995 - A GOOD YEAR FOR SINGAPORE BIOTECH

SINGAPORE - 1995 was a good year for biotechnology in Singapore, with a
total of 20 collaborative and commercial agreements signed during the
course of the year.

According to the year-end press briefing by the national Economic
Development Board, last year also saw several new investments and an
increasing number of biotech projects in the pipeline. Singapore's
biotech industry "is witnessing an era of exponential growth", surmised
the EDB.

Singapore benefits from its geographical location, which foreigners see
as strategically key in order to access the Asia-Pacific area. They can
use Singapore as a base for their research and development,
manufacturing, marketing and distribution requirements throughout the
region.

The EDB also reported on two investments by multinationals in
Singapore. Boehringer Mannheim of Germany formed a S$1.2 million
agreement with the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology for the
development of anticancers, and Rhone Merieux's Asia Pacific subsidiary
has committed to invest S$3 million in a locally based product
development centre.

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED PAW-PAWS

BRISBANE - Australian, Malaysian and Thai scientists are using genetic
engineering to develop disease-resistant paw-paws capable of combating
the papaya ringspot virus.

In recent years, the virus has devastated paw-paw crops throughout
South East Asia. In the mid-1980s, Thailand exported around $70 million
worth of paw-paws, now, however, it cannot supply the domestic market.

There is virtually no naturally occurring resistance to papaya ringspot
virus in Thai paw-paw varieties, leaving genetic engineering as the
most practical solution, according to Professor James Dale of the
Centre for Molecular Biotechnology of the Queensland University of
Technology.

Professor Dale and his team are collaborating

with the Thai Department of Agriculture and the Malaysian Agriculture
Research and Development Institute.

They have successfully developed a method of making Australian paw-paws
disease resistant by inserting papaya ringspot virus genes into the
plants. "So what we have to do is work with Thai scientists to develop
a similar process specific to Thai cultivars", commented Prof Dale.

BIOTECH TARGETS ALGAE POLLUTION

ADELAIDE - Toxic blue-green algae pollution in Australia is an annual
problem for the country's water control authorities. To address this,
the Sydney Water Board is backing  research at the Flinders University
of South Australia to develop a fluorescent marker that binds to
certain gene sequences of the blue-green algae, enabling their presence
to be quickly detected in water supplies.

The project also seeks to inhibit toxin production by blue-green algae.
Research leader Amanda Goodman commented: "If we can clone genes
involved in the toxin production pathway and from that get a handle on
how they are regulated, maybe there is something we can do at the
environmental level to make sure that even though the bacteria are
there, those particular genes are not expressed."

Rather than trying to poison the bacteria, the researchers are looking
at manipulating the environment so that it is not worth it for the
organism to switch on its toxin genes.

In other research, funded by the US Office of Naval Research, the
Flinders University team is working to combat bacteria fouling on
battleship hulls.

Bacteria thrive on immersed surfaces, creating what is known as
microbial biofilm. On the ship's hull, biofilm forms the basis of a
food chain which leads to encrustation, causing serious drag problems
for the vessel.

Previously the remedy was to coat hulls with toxic paints, but these
are now banned because of poisonous leaks. The researchers are
optimistic that their studies into the gene regulation of bacteria
which adhere to metal surfaces will lead to the design of non-toxic
coatings that will either repel bacteria or cause the biofilm to shed
regularly.

US BIOTECH ESTABLISHES UNRIVALLED POSITION

CAMBRIDGE, MA - In 1995, the US biotechnology industry established
itself as the unrivalled supplier of new products and technology to the
pharmaceutical industry. This leadership position encouraged the
investment community to add $3.48 billion to biotech cash reserves.

During the year, biotech companies formed more than 170 alliances with
pharmaceutical partners, with a total declared value exceeding $4.7
billion. Among these agreements were a number of strategic acquisitions
which covered late-stage products as well as enabling technologies such
as genomics and combinatorial chemistry, according to a 1995 review by
Feinstein Partners.

The average deal in 1995 was $28 million, 35 of which were valued at
more than $50 million. This contrasts with 66 agreements worth a total
of $3.2 billion in 1994. If, however, the 1994 transaction between
Chiron and Ciba-Geigy is excluded, the average deal size for the year
was only $17 million, with just nine alliances exceeding the $50
million mark.

$3.5 billion in public offerings

The significant flow of corporate agreements and headline-making
product successes attracted renewed financial interest in biotech.
Investors channelled nearly $3.5 billion into biotech public offerings
over the year, compared with $1.8 billion in 1994.

"The number and size of the alliances underscore the degree to which
the established pharmaceutical industry is looking towards
collaborations with biotech companies to fill their product pipeline",
said Feinstein Partners president Peter Feinstein. "The fact that
large, international pharmaceutical companies are both eager to pay
premiums for scientific discoveries and are willing to assume approval
and marketing risks gives comfort to the investment community. The
events of 1995 made it clear that biotech companies can create
tremendous shareholder value without necessarily bringing products to
market themselves."

The pattern of large agreements between the pharmaceutical and biotech
sectors is forecast to continue as a result of the downsizing of the
pharmaceutical industry which has created an increased demand for
product ideas from entrepreneurial ventures.

Notable deals

Recent transactions reflect the importance the mainstream
pharmaceutical industry assigns to the emerging technology and products
from the biotech pipeline. The Feinstein review highlights in
particular Hoechst Marion Roussel's agreements with ProScript, Ariad
Pharmaceuticals, Cell Genesys and Lynx Therapeutics, and Pfizer's
Pfizergen initiative which entailed deals in 1995 with Myco
Pharmaceuticals, Immusol, AEA Technology and Oxford Asymmetry. It also
notes several acquisitions, such as the Glaxo Wellcome/Affymax deal,
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's acquisition of the outstanding interest in
Applied Immune Sciences, and Sandoz, which strengthened its gene
therapy commitment with the purchase of Genetic Therapy.

The genomics companies - Myriad Genetics, Genome Therapeutics, Sequana
Therapeutics and Millenium Pharmaceuticals - concluded two major
agreements each during 1995, nearly all of which had reported values of
at least $50 million. Both Myriad and Sequana followed the transactions
with successful initial public offerings. A privately held
combinatorial chemistry company, ArQule, entered into three significant
alliances, a $30 million agreement with Pharmacia Biotech, a $50
million agreement with Solvay Duphar and a $35 million agreement with
Abbott.

Second-half pick-up

The bulk of the financial community investment in biotech was carried
out in the second half of 1995, on the back of favourable corporate
alliances and product progress. Key mid-year announcements included
Cephalon's successful Phase III clinical trial of Myotrophin in
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, and
AutoImmune's Phase II study of Colloral in rheumatoid arthritis.
Publicly traded biotech companies raised around $555 million in the
first six months of 1995 and $2.58 billion in the second half.

The pace of IPOs increased in the latter six months of last year. There
were a total of 29 IPOs by biotech companies in 1995, 15 of which took
place between October and December.

"Although the financial community's level of support for biotech
approached the peak year of 1991, investor interest reflected the
experience of prior years", said Mr Feinstein. "Unlike 1991, many of
the investments were in companies with products in clinical research
and with backing from corporate partners. Companies at earlier
development stages that went public in 1995 tended to have broad
enabling technologies and endorsements from multiple corporate
partners", he concluded.

1995 - A YEAR TO REMEMBER

WASHINGTON, DC - Most US citizens will remember 1995 as the year the
president and the Congress could not agree on how to balance the budget
resulting in the longest federal government shutdown in the country's
history.

However, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) will remember
1995 as "one of the best for raising money, improving stock prices and
forging productive partnerships between biotech and big pharmaceutical
companies", according to Carl Feldbaum, president of BIO.

The biotech industry raised $3.6 billion as of 30 November 1995,
compared to $2.2 billion in 1994, the best year on record, according to
Mr Feldbaum. This does not include milestone payments made in 1995
through big pharmaceutical-biotech research and development
collaborations, which would add more than $90 million to the total. And
stock prices more than doubled over 1994 closing prices.

Partnerships, collaborations and other deals between biotech and big
pharmaceutical companies are "way up", says BIO. In the first three
quarters of 1995, some 52 new deals were made, compared with 45 mergers
and acquisitions in 1994, totalling $3 billion. M&As between the
biotech companies are also on the rise. In just the first three
quarters of 1995, there were 36 M&As between biotech companies,
compared with 41 deals for the whole of 1994.

1995 also saw some major advances for drugs and agricultural products
in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA approved four biotech
drugs: Genotropin, Pharmacia; Bio-Tropin, Biotechnology General Corp;
Norditropin, Novo Nordisk; and WinRho, Univax Biologics - three human
growth hormones and a treatment for thrombocytopenic purpura.

Two biotech-based drug delivery systems were also approved (two
liposome products), and four drugs already on the market received
approvals for additional indications (Intron A, Neupogen, Leukine and
Roferon-A).

The nine new biotech agricultural products approved in 1995 included
two corn plants, a potato plant and a cotton plant with natural pest
resistance, herbicide tolerant soybeans, three delayed ripening
tomatoes and high-laurate rapeseed, or canola oil for manufacturing.

The advances for the industry in 1995 did not stop at the company
level. Major efforts to loosen up regulatory restrictions on the
industry were realised this past year.

The highlight of the year came in December when Senator Nancy
Kassenbaum, chairperson of the Labour and Human Resources Committee,
introduced the first comprehensive bill from congressional leadership
on FDA reform, which includes several provisions endorsed by BIO (BBN
No 114, 22 November 1995, page 1).

"Our board's two-tiered strategy of developing an agenda of near-term
improvements in the existing system before promoting longer-term
fundamental changes has proven to be the right approach", explained Mr
Feldbaum. "It made BIO the `voice of reason' in a complex debate and
gave us high credibility and a high profile", he added.

The US Patent and Trademark Office removed utility guidelines that had
been interpreted as requiring human clinical trial data for granting of
a patent on a biotech invention. This was signed into law by President
Clinton in November.

The National Institutes of Health eliminated the "reasonable price"
clause from Co-operative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs)
that govern technology transfer.

On 9 November, Vice-President Al Gore and Donna Shalala, Health and
Human Services Secretary, and FDA commissioner David Kessler announced
the elimination of establishment licenses and lot release requirements
for biotech products.

BIO also instituted some major changes in 1995, including the election
of a new chairman, Henri Termeer, chairman and chief executive officer
of Genzyme, and a new vice-chairman for health, Gordon Binder, chairman
and CEO of Amgen.

GENE THERAPY - EXTRAORDINARY POTENTIAL BUT OVERSOLD

BETHESDA, MD - Scientists, researchers and the news media were
chastised for overselling and blowing out of proportion the present
state of gene transfer therapy in an advisory panel report to Harold
Varmus, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The report, published at the end of last year, was prepared by an
expert panel of scientists and academics, appointed to assess the NIH
investment in gene therapy research. Although the panel members were
unanimous in recognising that there is extraordinary potential in the
long term for gene therapy to manage and correct human disease, they
were concerned that: "Expectations of current gene therapy have been
oversold."

Mistaken perceptions

Following three meetings which included federal and industry scientists
and researchers, and after reviewing major research projects, the panel
wrote: "Over zealous representation of clinical gene therapy has
obscured the exploratory nature of the initial studies, coloured the
manner in which findings are portrayed to the scientific press and
public, and led to the widely held, but mistaken, perception that
clinical gene therapy is already highly successful." The report notes
that the current reality is that gene therapy has yet to yield
significant therapeutic benefits.

Panel members believed that it will require time to develop the science
of the field and convert advances to clinical practice. While
expectations show promise, clinical efficacy has not been definitively
shown at this time in any gene therapy protocol. The major obstacle to
successful gene therapy, the panel asserts, is to find the appropriate
vector to transfer the appropriate gene to the appropriate cell and to
maintain its transfer.

The first gene therapy occurred at the NIH five years ago, drawing the
attention of the scientific and medical communities, media and lay
circles. As of June 1995, there had been 106 clinical protocols
involving gene transfers on 597 subjects. Presently, the NIH spends
$200 million of its $11 million budget on gene therapy. It is estimated
that private industry's spending on gene therapy research exceeds that
spent by the NIH and underwrites the major proportion of approved
clinical protocols.

Panel recommendations

Based on their findings, the panel makes the following recommendations:

* Greater focus is required on the basic aspects of gene transfer and
gene expression within the context of gene transfer approaches.

* Increased emphasis is needed on research dealing with the mechanisms
of disease pathogenesis.

* Investigators must strictly adhere to high standards in clinical
protocols.

* Broad interdisciplinary training of MD and PhD investigators at the
interface of clinical and basic science should be supported.

* Investigators in the field and their supporters need to be more
restrained in their public discussions of findings, publications and
gene therapy prospects.

* The NIH funding of gene therapy is currently adequate. Future gene
research should compete with other forms of biomedical research under
stringent peer review. The panel specifically did not recommend special
gene therapy or expansion of the recently funded core vector production
programme.

* The NIH should encourage collaborative arrangements between academic
institutions and industry that complement the NIH supported research.

* The NIH's intramural research programme needs better coordination of
its scientific review of gene research being undertaken throughout the
NIH's intramural research programme to avoid duplication of effort and
improve gene research.

US FDA YEAR-END APPROVALS

WASHINGTON, DC - The US Food and Drug Administration was busy before it
started celebrating the Christmas and New Year season. It was a good
thing too, because between the 8 and 15 January the agency hibernated
from the two feet snow storm and the Martin Luther King federal
holiday.

Three biotechnology products were approved before the tremendous slow
down:

* Amplified Mycobacterium TB Direct Test made by Gen-Probe was approved
on the 18 December, as a fast, new laboratory test to help detect the
bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The test was approved for use only
on specimens of sputum that an acid fast stain has already shown are
likely to be positive for TB bacteria. Expedited review was undertaken
by the agency because of its importance to the public health in the
control of tuberculosis.

The FDA notes that not all patients with TB have the bacteria in their
sputum. For those who do, however, the new test provides reliable,
specific results in four to five hours compared with the conventional
culture methods which require one to eight weeks for reliable results.

By obtaining results more quickly, the new test will enable doctors to
begin antibiotic treatment earlier. The clinical studies on the safety
and efficacy of the test submitted by the manufacturer was reviewed by
the Microbiology Devices Panel of the FDA's Medical Devices Advisory
Committee in May 1995. The studies showed that the new test was 95.5
per cent sensitive to detect the TB bacteria that had been identified
by the acid fast stain and followed up with a culture. Because of
concern over false negative results, the FDA is requiring that the test
be used along with conventional acid fast stain, then followed up with
a culture to confirm the presence of TB.

* Anagen of the UK received FDA clearance on the 20 December for its
new assay to measure testosterone. The developer of automated
immunoassay systems announced that this marks a range of 16 assays
cleared by the FDA for sale on its AuraFlex automated immunoassay
system. Two more assays have completed development with two more close
to completion. Regulatory submissions for these assays will be made
through new marketing partners when arrangements have been made.

Anagen suffered a major setback when Organon Technik unexpectedly
pulled out as a worldwide distributor for the company's lead product,
AuraFlex, the automated in vitro immunodiagnostic testing machine,
designed by Anagen and built by contractors. Confident of securing a
marketing deal soon, the company expects sales to flow within the first
half of 1996.

* Leukine (sargramostim) was approved on the 22 December, for patients
undergoing certain types of blood-cell transplants. The drug, developed
by Immunex, had won approval earlier in the year for treatment of
patients undergoing bone marrow transplants from matched donors and for
patients with a form of leukaemia. The procedure for blood-cell
transplants includes harvesting of blood from patients before
chemotherapy, isolating progenitor cells and then reintroducing them
after chemotherapy to aid recovery. Clinical studies have shown that
Leukine helped increase the number of progenitor cells collected and
aided in white blood-cell recovery after transplant.

Immunex claims that Leukine is the first growth factor indicated for
use in gathering peripheral blood progenitor cells after transplant.
The FDA has declined approval to market the drug in the general
chemotherapy market.

FDA ADDRESSES INFO DISSEMINATION

WASHINGTON, DC - The US Food and Drug Administration has posted notices
on Advertising and Promotion; Draft Guidances.

The two draft guidance documents are entitled: Guidance to Industry on
Dissemination of Reprints of Certain Published, Original Data and
Guidance for Industry Funded Dissemination of Reference Texts. They are
directed to the sponsors of human and animal drugs, medical devices and
biological products to inform them as to what published material is
permitted to be disseminated when discussing FDA approved products.

The FDA has taken the position that sponsors may not disseminate
information inconsistent with the FDA-approved labelling or cleared
use(s). Inconsistent information may be in conflict with the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Permitting
inconsistent information to be distributed by sponsors would encourage
them not to carry out the clinical studies to verify the product is
safe and effective for its unproved use. Also information put out by a
biased source has the potential to mislead healthcare professionals.

At present the FDA has proposed to modified two of its policies which
would allow sponsors to distribute information under certain
circumstances. In the case of distribution of reprints of published,
original data, sponsors may disseminate information and data that the
agency relied on for its approval or clearance, even though these may
contain information different from the approved labelling. This can
only be done, however, if the article published the original efficacy
trials in accordance with the regular peer-review procedure of the
journal.

The reprint must be from a bona fide peer-reviewed journal that uses
experts in the field to review articles. If the information is
different from the approved labelling, the reprint must prominently
state the differences on a sticker attach to the reprint.

The second modification proposed concerned industry-funded
dissemination of reference texts. The FDA will permit distribution of
sound, authoritative materials that are not false or misleading and
were written and published independently of the commercial interest of
the sponsor.

The reference text must not be written, edited, excerpted, or published
specifically for the sponsor. The text should not be reviewed, edited
or influenced by the sponsor or its agent. The sponsor is not to be the
sole distributor of the text; rather there should be other distribution
channels where similar books are normally available.

Furthermore, the text should not focus on any specific drug(s),
device(s), or biologic(s) of the disseminating sponsor. Specific
product information should not be physically appended to the reference
text.

AMGEN ENHANCES KIDNEY FAILURE RESEARCH

THOUSAND OAKS, CA - Amgen has enhanced its research into kidney failure
through a tie-up with NPS Pharmaceuticals.

The two companies will collaborate on the development and
commercialisation of NPS' Norcalcin and other compounds based on NPS'
proprietary calcium receptor technology for the treatment of
hyperparathyroidism (HPT), one form of which is commonly seen as a
result of kidney failure.

Amgen already has a strong presence in the renal community as a result
of Epogen which combats the anaemia experienced by chronic renal
failure patients on dialysis.

"Amgen is a particularly appropriate partner for the development of
Norcalcin because of its extremely strong presence in the renal field
and its growing interest in endocrinology", said Hunter Jackson,
president and chief executive officer of NPS.

In addition, Amgen has already worked with Kirin, NPS' corporate
partner for Norcalcin in Asia, noted Dr Jackson: "This combination of
corporate partners provides the financial resources and outstanding
development capabilities to expedite the thorough development of
Norcalcin".

$10 million licence fee

Under the terms of the agreement, NPS will receive from Amgen an
initial licence fee of $10 million, potential additional milestone
payments totalling $26 million, plus royalties on product sales. Amgen
will also purchase one million shares of NPS common stock for $7.5
million, at the market price of the company's shares in November when
negotiations began. NPS expects to have around $25 million in cash
after closing the agreement with Amgen.

Amgen will receive exclusive worldwide rights, excluding Japan, China,
Korea and Taiwan, to develop and sell Norcalcin, which is currently in
Phase I/II clinical trials, and certain other compounds for the
treatment of HPT. Both companies will participate in development, but
Amgen will pay all costs to develop and commercialise products.

SUGEN/AMGEN END COLLABORATION

REDWOOD CITY, CA - Sugen and Amgen announced that they have terminated
their four-year research collaboration in neurobiology and
haematopoiesis one year earlier than planned.

The aim of the collaboration, set up in 1992, was to identify novel
signal transduction targets for therapeutic intervention against
certain neurological and haematopoietic disorders.

The deal was, however, struck when Sugen was in its infancy and was
essentially a technology company with no specific disease focus.
Although the deal was a significant boost for Sugen and brought in much-
needed funds, the research did not subsequently fit within its core
disease targets, a company spokesperson told Biotechnology Business
News.

Later, when Amgen bought the faltering US biotechnology company,
Synergen, it acquired its own, in-house neurobiological speciality,
changing the role of the external collaboration.

Sugen noted that it was disappointed by the early wind-up, but added
that the redeployment of 50 per cent of its research staff from the
Amgen/Sugen focus to its own programmes should benefit the company in
the long term.

The status of the research programme will be reviewed to see what Sugen
has and progress will be evaluated, but no concentrated research effort
in this field is planned, they noted.

Sugen plans to assess the implications of the aborted agreement on the
allocation of its internal research resources and its corporate
partnering opportunities over the coming months.

An amicable split

The termination is described by both companies as amicable and they
maintain a "positive corporate relationship", which could lead to
future collaborations, commented the spokesperson.

Under the terms of the early conclusion of the deal, Amgen will make a
final payment to Sugen of $2.5 million. Amgen is also granting back to
Sugen exclusive worldwide rights to 22 proprietary signal transduction
targets discovered in the course of the collaboration, subject to
royalty payments back to Amgen with respect to potential future product
sales.

In addition, Sugen is buying back from Amgen 235,000 shares of Sugen
common stock at $11.48 per share, thereby reducing Amgen's current
Sugen shareholding to 153,000. At the same time, Amgen will purchase
from Sugen for $200,000 a seven-year warrant to buy 200,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $15.50 per share.

Sugen does not expect the terms of the wind-up to have a material
effect on its 1995 and 1996 profit and loss statements.

EU DEBATE ON BIOTECH: STILL CIRCULAR, BUT A WIDER CIRCLE

BRUSSELS - There was more than a slight sense of deje vu to the high-
profile European Union Biotechnology Conference held in Brussels on the
11 January.

The agenda was familiar - research and public perception, the
regulatory framework, and competitiveness. So too were many of the
arguments - ranging from the most bullish predictions of biotech's
potential for creating jobs, wealth and well-being, through to dire
warnings of the risks it presents to health, ethics and the
environment. Even many of the speakers were veterans of this long-
running EU debate, which has, over recent years, seemed increasingly
circular.

The real novelty of this meeting was the fact that it brought together
a wider range of participants - and particularly all three of the key
EU institutions: the Parliament, which had provided much of the impetus
behind the meeting, and was represented by some 30 members, including
four chairmen of relevant committees; the Commission, which formally
organised it and fielded an unprecedented high-level turnout, including
five commissioners and the secretary general; and the Council of
Ministers, with representatives of all the Member States, in many cases
at the level of senior national officials, and in some cases at
ministerial level.

European Commission President Jacques Santer had given his full
blessing to the meeting (he was prevented from attending in person only
by the funeral of the former French president Francois Mitterand), and
sent a message stressing that information, transparency and dialogue
are the appropriate responses to criticisms, doubts and fears that
biotech has generated. The Commission acknowledges that public
authorities will also have to address the issue of "technology
aversion" that biotech has raised.

European Parliament Vice-President Nicole Fontaine welcomed the
opportunity for the "trialogue" (in the jargon of Brussels) to address
biotech - one of the "great themes of today" - in a broad context.
Current or recent EP debates touching on specific aspects of biotech -
on patents, employment opportunities, regulation, research and ethics -
had demonstrated how much biotech raised "the most fundamental
questions touching human beings and their dignity", she said.

Professor Giovanni Zanetti, Italian Under Secretary of State for
Industry, as the representative of the EU Presidency, expressed
optimism at the conclusion of the meeting that the exchanges had helped
build a sounder base for moving the discussion forward towards
consensus.

But even if the debate is now wider, there were no more conclusions
from this conference on EU biotech policy than there have been from the
many earlier meetings on the subject in Brussels and Strasbourg. It
certainly offered an opportunity for everyone involved to get to know
the points of view of the EU institutions and Member States, as Nicole
Fontaine observed - which meant that the voices of the biotech backers
and its opponents were louder than ever. It is less certain that the
trialogue thus launched will lead to the hoped for "consensus on the
distinct concrete issues", she commented.

The European Commission stressed its now well-established view that
biotech is "one of the most promising and crucial technologies for the
next century", suggesting that European biotech generates turnover of
Ecu450 billion a year and in the sectors where it has a direct impact,
it accounts for 9 per cent of EU gross value added and more than 8 per
cent of its employment - more than nine million jobs in
biopharmaceuticals, agriculture and food processing (notably crops and
micro-organisms), and biofuels, bioremediation, and chemicals.

But it recognises that the challenge for the EU is now to ensure that
output, employment and investment takes place in the EU, rather than
the EU becoming just a market - it must decide now whether to be a
producer, or merely a consumer, as Commission Vice-President Martin
Bangemann expressed it. "The world moves on, even if we do not", he
warned in sombre mood.

His views were vehemently supported by the UK Under Secretary of State
for Science and Technology, Ian Taylor, who described the evidence of
Europe's competitive disadvantage as "alarming". In his view, the risk
was that the gap would widen unless EU attitudes to biotech changed and
a more encouraging environment was created, with faster and more
flexible decision-making, strong patents, and an open single market.
"We should not exaggerate the risks by inventing mythical problems", he
asserted, "what on earth are we doing trying to invent problems", he
asked.

In the Commission's analysis, the EU's global position in biotech is
not what it should be. Although it has major core companies and an
excellent research and development base, there are only some 485
biotech companies in the EU (a declining number), compared with 1,300
in the US. The EU trails the US on biotech patents: between 1978 and
June 1994, EU-based firms filed fewer patents at the European Patent
Office than their US counterparts, and in the pharmaceutical sector, 65
per cent of the biotech patents worldwide are US, against 15 per cent
European. EU investment and research spending is relatively low:
between 1986 and the end of 1994, EU-based firms invested more than
Ecu2.8 billion in the US and Ecu600 million in Japan; and EU R&D
investment in biotech, both from public and private sources, is only
Ecu2.2 billion a year, compared with more than Ecu7 billion in the US
and Ecu 2.4 billion in Japan. Heinrich Kolb, Secretary of State in the
German Ministry of Economic Affairs, confirmed that Germany was also
suffering from an outward shift in biotech investment.

The Commission also admits that the EU regulatory framework has not
proved to be so favourable for innovation and technology diffusion:
there are no uniform patent rules;  current regulatory oversight of
biotech at the R&D stage is "not well-adapted", since it makes no
distinction between high-risk and low-risk areas, despite the fact that
much of the research in biopharmaceuticals and agriculture consists of
operations with low or negligible risk; and for important areas such as
novel foods, product legislation is still pending. Even President
Santer's message to the meeting recognised explicitly that in the
biotech sector "more and more often European firms prefer to invest
elsewhere than in Europe".

The Commission defends its own record on behalf of the sector, pointing
out that it has been active in promoting new legislation and seeking to
bring older legislation up to date. It proposed amendments at the end
of 1995 to Directive 90/219 on the contained use of genetically
modified micro-organisms, aimed at a more risk-based regulation. It
also approved a new proposal for a Directive on the legal protection of
biotech inventions. It is at present carrying out a review of Directive
90/220 on controlled release, and a report is expected shortly
identifying the weaknesses of the current rules and the scope for
eliminating or reducing regulatory redundancies without jeopardising
safety.

In addition, the new novel foods regulation, already in the
consultation process (currently at second reading before the
Parliament), aims, says the Commission, at ensuring safety, consumer
protection and information, while permitting smooth operation of the
internal market, without placing unjustified burden on users and
without stigmatising the use of modern biotech.

President Santer added that in this context the Commission aimed to
review some agriculture rules during 1996 and to see what could be done
to stimulate further innovation among smaller biotech firms.

The Commission also offered encouragement to Member States in their
efforts to create a favourable investment climate (especially through
the development of science parks to stimulate biotech diffusion among
small and medium-sized companies). But it is up to the firms themselves
to develop modern biotech-based activities to a critical size, says the
Commission. The public authorities' role is to create appropriate
framework conditions that ensure product approval according to criteria
of efficacy, safety and performance, and regulatory oversight based on
sound scientific principles.

Commissioner Mario Monti, the sponsor of the new proposal the
Commission launched in December 1995 to provide legal protection for
biotech inventions (BBN No 116, 19 December 1995, page 1), said the
motivation behind the new draft was the same as that behind the
proposal that was thrown out by the EP early in 1995 after seven years
of discussion: to bring EU patent laws up to date, and to remove the
"unacceptable" uncertainty that continues to reign on patent rights on
biotech.

To overcome the reticences over the failed proposal, the new draft aims
to meet the "complementary" demands of all sides: the clear line the EP
called for between what may be patented, and what may not be; and the
Council's demand for a text that provided a clear framework and a level
of protection sufficient to promote R&D, said Commissioner Monti.

European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler noted biotech's
potential "to introduce improvements in crops and animals which will
have direct and beneficial effects on food quality and the non-food
uses of crops". But at the same time, he warned that this will occur
only if "consumers of agricultural products can be persuaded that
biotech is being used in a responsible and ethical way". Just because a
technique can be used does not mean that it ought to be used, he said,
suggesting that consumers "will judge each case on its merits". So
unless biotech and its benefits are explained to the population in a
comprehensive way, advances will continue to be jeopardised by lack of
knowledge and "we may lose the benefits which biotech has to offer".

For crops, the Agriculture Commissioner listed scrupulously the
advantages of biotech techniques that are creating disease and pest
resistance, diagnostic agents, mechanisms to insert desired production
and quality characteristics, and the introduction of resistance to
undesirable environmental factors, as well as improvements to
hardwoods, cotton and other fibre crops, such as flax, and crops
engineered to provide wood, starch, oils, fats, and polysaccharides, or
to produce energy.

He was equally exhaustive in his listing of advances in livestock
farming, for animal nutrition, and in the control of human and animal
diseases.

Commissioner Fischler was notably reserved on the genetic modification
of farm animals. While techniques to produce pharmaceutical products
(such as sheep able to produce human blood-clotting factors in their
milk) were relatively uncontroversial, "attempts to produce so-called
super animals have not been successful and, indeed, may in the long
term be fruitless", he said.

While it is possible to insert genetic material coding for extra growth
hormone production into the fertilised eggs of farm animals, "it has
not yet proved possible to control the expression of these genes in the
whole animal", he insisted, noting that "the uncontrolled expression of
growth hormones results in gross and unacceptable deformity and
suffering", and questioning "whether it is economically or ethically
desirable", even if the process can be fully controlled.

Commissioner Fischler's ambivalence was mirrored in the remarks of MEPs
such as Karl von Wogau, chairman of the EP's Committee on Economic
Affairs and Industrial Policy, who endorsed the call for progress, but
insisted on the need to respect ethics and public opinion. Other MEPs,
notably Green champion Hiltrud Breyer, were more uncompromising,
insisting that the EU's current legislation is better for the biotech
industry than the US system, offering more stability. It would be
unhelpful for industry to start modifying that framework again, so soon
after creating it, she argued; the only area she wanted to see changed
was tighter controls to prevent "poor-quality investments" such as, she
instanced, in the development of recombinant BST.

The Senior Advisory Group on Biotechnology said in advance of the
meeting that it wants: action on a coherent overall policy promoting
European biotech; steady macro-economic policies to attract investment;
regulatory simplification; consistent Single Market rule for novel
foods and patents; better links between innovative research and
funding; encouragement for capital investment in biotech start-ups;
more efforts to inform the public; employment-friendly conditions;
improved education and training; and promotion of the use of biotech to
manage the sustainable use of natural resources.

After the meeting, the SAGB's new Director General, Andrew Dickson,
told Biotechnology Business News that he felt the meeting had made a
useful contribution to "genuine dialogue", and that he perceived a
growing trend of support for industry views.

The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations said
it hoped the meeting would help underline the importance of biotech for
the future development of the EU. It wants to see "a policy framework
to enhance competitiveness and create favourable conditions for
industrial activities related to biotech".

It remains to be seen how far the widening of the EU circular debate
will deliver any results that satisfy the "progressives" seeking
competitiveness without alienating the "conservatives" whose priorities
are more the ethical, social and environmental considerations,
producing nothing more than a new series of stalemates on creating
better conditions for biotech in Europe.

PROGENICS LICENSES MELANOMA VACCINE

TARRYTOWN, NY - Progenics has licensed a melanoma vaccine from the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

The vaccine, known as GMK, is one of the most clinically advanced
cancer vaccines and is the first of a new class of ganglioside
conjugate vaccines being developed by Progenics for cancer therapy.

Under the licensing agreement, Progenics receives a worldwide exclusive
licence to the ganglioside conjugate vaccine platform technology for
cancer treatment.

Two Phase III clinical trials, designed to meet US and worldwide
approval requirements, are expected to begin early this year. They will
involve high-risk melanoma patients in the US and Europe.

The US trial will be conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group in conjunction with the Memorial Sloan-Kettering and other
hospitals and clinics in the US. The second study will be carried out
by the Institute of Cancer Research/Royal Cancer hospital in the UK, in
association with other European hospitals and clinics.

Progenics is also planning clinical trials this year with a second
ganglioside conjugate vaccine, MGV, for the treatment of other cancers.

In a separate transaction, Progenics signed a worldwide exclusive
licence and supply agreement with Cambridge Biotech of Worcester,
Massachusetts, for the immunological adjuvant, QS-21, for use in GMK
and certain other ganglioside conjugate vaccines for the treatment of
cancer. Specific financial terms were not disclosed.

Melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is on the increase in
the industrialised world. Around 37,000 new cases of melanoma were
reported in the US in 1994. By the turn of the century, it is estimated
that one in 90 Americans will develop melanoma.

IDEC AND EISAI TARGET AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE

SAN DIEGO, CA - IDEC Pharmaceuticals said it has signed a research and
development agreement with Eisai of Japan to target autoimmune disease.

The two companies will focus specifically on the development of
humanised and Primatised antibodies against the gp39 antigen. This
antigen, also known as the CD40 ligand, is an essential immune system
trigger for B cell activation and antibody production.

Potential target indications include antibody-mediated autoimmune
diseases, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and systemic
lupus erythematosus.

The agreement calls for Eisai to provide up to $37.5 million in licence
fee payments and R&D support at IDEC. In return, Eisai will receive
exclusive rights to develop and market resulting products in Japan,
Asia and Europe, for which IDEC would receive royalties. IDEC has
retained all rights to North America and certain other markets.

This transaction is IDEC's fifth R&D collaboration to date and the
fourth related to the company's proprietary Primatised antibody
technology.

HOECHST/RPR FORM WORLD-LEADING PLASMA CO

NEW YORK, NY - Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer have formed a 50:50
joint venture creating the world's leading global plasma protein
company.

The $1.2 billion new company, known as Centeon, has been set up with
the assets of Hoechst and RPR's plasma-protein activities, from
Behringwerke and Armour Pharmaceutical respectively.

"Our strategy is clear", said Centeon chief executive officer John
Sedor, "Centeon will invest in research and development to lead the
plasma protein industry in accelerating the availability of new
products from human plasma and through biotechnology."

The size of Centeon's operations will benefit the company in a sector
characterised by regionalised companies, giving it the critical mass
and market access to meet patient needs worldwide.

Plasma protein products are used in the treatment of immune
deficiencies, trauma, coagulation disorders, bone marrow transplants
and neurological disorders. Centeon aims to provide a comprehensive
range of plasma products in all of the therapeutic applications,
including antihaemophilic factors, immunoglobulins, plasma substitutes,
wound healing agents and inhibitor treatments.

Double the investment

R&D investment will be at twice the combined level currently invested
by Behringwerke and Armour, ie around $60-80 million a year. Work will
focus primarily on: rDNA technology - the development of therapeutics
prepared by recombinant technology that improves the treatment of
haemophilia; gene therapy - the repair of genetic defects, the
replacement of missing genes, and the use of non-plasma therapies; and
blood components - the investigation of modified blood components,
including red blood cells and lyophilised platelets for use in
transfusion medicine.

As well as correlative R&D strengths and product lines, Armour and
Behringwerke bring geographical complementarity to Centeon. Armour has
a strong presence in the US, while Behringwerke is a leader in Europe
and Japan - three markets that make up three-quarters of the plasma
protein therapies industry.

Centeon is headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, with
corporate functions in both the US and Germany. The company will employ
4,500 people worldwide and has plasma fractionation plants in Kankakee,
Illinois (US), and in the European cities of Marburg (Germany),
Strasbourg (France), Vienna (Austria) and Barcelona (Spain).

RGENE STRIKES GENE DELIVERY DEAL

THE WOODLANDS, TX - RGene Therapeutics has formed a licensing agreement
with Pasteur Merieux-Connaught, covering the use of DC-cholesterol as a
gene delivery system.

DC-cholesterol, RGene's proprietary cationic lipid, will be exclusively
licensed to Pasteur Merieux-Connaught for use as an immunoadjuvant in
traditional vaccines. "We believe that DC-cholesterol will benefit the
development of our next generation of vaccines", said chairman and
chief executive officer of Pasteur Merieux-Connaught, Jean-Jacques
Bertrand.

RGene is developing DC-cholesterol as a gene delivery method for
nucleic acids. It is the only non-viral gene delivery system to date
that has demonstrated in two published human clinical trials, effective
gene delivery.

In addition, animal studies using RGene's gene therapeutic, RGG0853
(the suppressor gene E1A, complexed with DC-cholesterol), have shown
that gene delivery by DC-cholesterol provides antitumour activity
comparable to genes delivered by the adenovirus vector.

CUBIST IN DEAL WITH PFIZER

CAMBRIDGE, MA - Cubist Pharmaceuticals said it has formed a research
and licensing deal with Pfizer to develop and market new antibacterial
drugs.

Resistant pathogens and other organisms which lack adequate therapy are
significant clinical problems. Pathogens, such as Staphylococcus
aureus, Enterococcus species and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause
diseases including skin, soft tissue, bloodstream, urinary, respiratory
and ear infections, have now been identified as being resistant to most
available antibiotics.

The companies will collaborate on the discovery of novel broad-spectrum
antibacterial agents directed towards specific aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase targets with activity against resistant pathogens.

Initially, Pfizer will use its diverse chemical library and expertise
in high-throughput screening to identify lead compounds that inhibit
the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Cubist will provide proprietary
biomolecular targets and assay systems.

Pfizer will fund research at Cubist for the progression of lead
compounds. As drug discovery and development advances, Pfizer will have
the option to make an equity investment and will be responsible for
clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of the
antibacterials.

Cubist will receive an upfront technology access fee, milestone
payments throughout the course of drug development and royalties on
product sales. In return, Pfizer obtains worldwide licensing rights to
market antibacterial agents developed during the collaboration.

Specific terms of the agreement were not reported.

ALEXION FACES FIERCE COMPETITION

NEW HAVEN, CT - The US biotechnology company, Alexion Pharmaceuticals,
has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to sell two
million common shares through a public offering.

The company plans to sell the shares at $8-9 a share and expects to
raise about $14.8 million, after expenses. The public, after the sale
is completed, will own about 29.4 per cent of the company's outstanding
6.78 million shares. US Surgical holds a 9.5 per cent stake in the
company.

In October, Alexion was awarded a $2 million grant from the US
Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and
Technology's Advanced Technology programme. The award was to help
support its programme to develop genetically engineered pig organs for
transplantation into patients without clinical rejection.

Alexion's genetically altered pig organs express an inhibitor of human
complement inflammatory proteins to thwart organ rejection. The company
expects to develop a colony of transgenically engineered pigs and to
implant their organs into primates within 15 to 20 months, followed by
human implantation.

Developing genetically altered pigs for human implantation has become
extremely competitive as companies strive to be major players in what
is seen as a $1 million annual market. Pigs have been selected because
their organs are similar in size to humans and they can be raised, free
of disease, in large numbers. Human DNA is injected into fertilised pig
eggs in the effort to have the pigs produce proteins that act to
suppress the organ rejection response.

Three other companies are also actively and competitively engaged in
this market - Immutran in Cambridge, UK, has been working to transplant
pig hearts into baboons. BioTransplant (Cambridge, Massachusetts), in
collaboration with researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, is
developing immunosuppressive drugs to ensure tolerance to cross-species
implantation. They have also used primates to accept donor organs from
genetically in-bred pigs. The Swiss company, Sandoz, is helping to fund
both these efforts and expects to spend about $1 billion on this work
during the next couple of years.

In July, New Jersey-based Nextran and Duke University Medical Center
obtained clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration to provide
genetically modified pig livers as temporary organ support to patients
with end-stage liver disease. It is believed that the livers, placed
outside the body and lasting one day (then replaced by a new pig
liver), will provide patient support until a donor becomes available or
the patient's own liver regenerates.

The United Network for Organ Sharing claims that there are 18,000
heart, kidney and liver transplants performed in the US each year.
There are, however, 40,000 qualified patients waiting for usable
organs. Additionally, there are over 100,000 patients, who are
classified as unqualified because of age or disease progression, who
die annually for lack of suitable organs. The US spends $6 billion
annually to provide dialysis for 150,000 renal patients; a significant
proportion of which could be saved were kidney organs for
transplantation available.

PEPTOR COMPLETES SECOND FINANCING

Ness Ziona - Peptor, an Israeli start-up company developing peptide
drugs, has raised $9 million in a private placement to US institutional
investors. The company was valued at $23 million before the offering.

Although the company is only three years old, this is its second
private placement. Two years ago, it raised $10 million from Israeli
and US investors.

Peptor hopes to use this latest round of investment to take its two
major products - an analogue of somatostatin for the treatment of
gastrointestinal disease, and a library of peptides for an antifungal
peptide developed by Xoma - to US Food and Drug Administration approved
clinical trials by 1997.

Yoram Karmon, chief executive officer of Peptor, says that there has
been pressure on the company to go public. He prefers, however, to wait
until the end of 1996 when Peptor will have achieved more milestones
and will thus have a greater value.

Peptor is currently negotiating a possible joint venture with the US
company, Neoprobe, and with a European multinational. Both of these
potential collaborations cover the development of peptides to treat
cancer.

SECOND BREAST CANCER GENE ISOLATED

LONDON & SALT LAKE CITY, UT - The second breast cancer gene, known as
BRCA2, has been isolated.

The UK charity, the Cancer Research Campaign (CRC), announced on the 20
December last year that a consortium led by a CRC-funded researcher,
had isolated the gene and a patent application had been filed.

On the same day as the CRC announcement, Myriad Genetics of the US said
it had filed a US patent application on the full sequence of a "strong
candidate for BRCA2 + [which] covers all diagnostic and therapeutic
uses of this newly discovered gene."

BRCA2 is thought to be a critical factor for more than one-third of
those families worldwide with a history of breast cancer in many female
relatives. It also plays a key role in the development of breast cancer
in men in these families.

In 1994, CRC researchers reported that BRCA1, the only gene at that
time known to be involved in hereditary breast cancer, was not
responsible for the disease in families which include male breast
cancer sufferers. They therefore concluded that another gene must be at
fault in these families and located BRCA2 six months later on
chromosome 13.

Mutations in BRCA2 are believed to be the cause of about 2 per cent of
all breast cancer cases, including a currently unquantifiable
proportion of the rare, but often fatal, form of the disease which
claims the lives of around 100 UK men every year.

More genes to be discovered?

Recent research suggests that BRCA1 accounts for almost half of the
1,000 plus known breast cancer families in the UK, while BRCA2 is
probably responsible for a third. This supports the theory that one or
more family breast cancer genes may remain to be discovered. Scientists
also believe that BRCA1 and BRCA2 are connected to an increased
incidence of some other cancers, such as prostate and eye cancer.
However, the lifetime risks of developing these cancers are much lower
than for breast cancer.

In isolating BRCA2, the CRC researchers at the Institute of Cancer
Research worked as part of an international collaboration involving
Wellcome Trust-funded scientists at the UK's Sanger Centre and Imperial
Cancer Research Fund, as well as with Duke University Medical Center in
North Carolina, US. Additional help came from groups in Iceland, the
Netherlands, France and Canada, and the breast cancer charity,
Breakthrough.

The next stage of research will examine both the function of BRCA2 and
the consequences of gene damage, and the role of the gene in non-family
breast cancers.

The CRC's technology transfer arm, CRC Technology, filed a preliminary
UK patent application on the research findings in November. The claims
of the application have not yet been defined but are expected to cover
the gene sequence and its use for new approaches to the prevention,
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

Myriad

Myriad said that its scientists had cloned and obtained the complete
sequence of the gene and had confirmed through familial analysis of
breast cancer cases that mutations in it predispose certain women to
early onset of the disease.

Myriad comments that it expects to launch a test in the second half of
1996 for mutations in BRCA1, which was isolated by the company and
collaborators in 1994, and intends to develop a test that incorporates
BRCA2.

A spokesperson for CRC Technology told Biotechnology Business News that
it was unclear at present whether both patent applications covered the
same gene, but expected the position to be clarified in the near
future. They added that the CRC believes that it was the first to
isolate the gene.

Each year in the UK, more than 31,000 women have breast cancer newly
diagnosed and 14,500 die of the disease.

AGOURON TO STUDY NEW ANTICANCERS

SAN FRANCISCO, CA - Agouron Pharmaceuticals plans to initiate work on
two new anticancer drugs this year, according to company president and
chief executive officer, Peter Johnson.

Speaking at the Hambrecht & Quist 14th Annual Life Science Conference,
Mr Johnson told delegates that preclinical toxicology has begun for the
first product candidate, AG2034, an inhibitor of an enzyme required for
the synthesis of purine nucleotides essential for sustained
proliferation of cancer cells. AG2034 has shown potent antitumour
activity in preclinical animal models of cancer.

The second compound, AG3340, has been selected for development as an
anticancer from Agouron's programme to discover selective inhibitors of
matrix metalloprotease enzymes involved in cancer and arthritis. AG3340
has demonstrated significant antimetastatic and antitumour activity in
animal models, as well as oral bioavailability and a favourable
pharmacokinetic profile.

R&D update

Other research and development progress to date includes the completion
of a clinical programme of four-week pilot Phase II studies of several
different dose regimens of Agouron's anti-HIV product, Viracept
(nelfinavir mesylate, formerly known as AG1343). The studies
demonstrated that Viracept has potent acute activity against HIV.

The anticancer, Thymitaq (AG337), is being evaluated in six separate
Phase II clinical trials against solid tumours associated with lung,
colon, liver, pancreatic, prostate and head/neck cancers. The trials
have enrolled a total of 120 patients.

Mr Johnson noted that Agouron is in a "strong financial position" to
carry out its R&D programmes. In the current fiscal year to 30 June
1996, the company expects to report around $40 million in R&D-related
revenues from corporate partners and is positioned to fund the balance
of its near-term operating expenses from cash and short-term
investments currently in excess of $100 million.

SEQUANA LINKS GENE TO MELANOMA

SAN DIEGO, CA - Scientists at California-based Sequana Therapeutics
have identified a second gene responsible for malignant melanoma, a
deadly form of skin cancer related to over-exposure to the sun.

Around 33,000 people in the US a year are diagnosed with melanoma
resulting in about 7,000 deaths. However, most cases can be cured if
caught in the early stages.

Using DNA samples from the National Cancer Institute, Nicholas
Dracopoli and colleagues at Sequana examined DNA from members of
families with hereditary melanoma. After excluding families with
defects in a known cancer gene, the researchers found that two of the
affected families had a mutated form of the CDK4 gene.

The scientists identified a germline mutation (which means it can be
passed from parent to child) in the CDK4 gene and were able to screen
patients who inherited the defective form of CDK4 and advise those who
were most susceptible to developing the condition to get regular
testing to find the melanoma at an early stage.

Although it is unlikely that mutations in CDK4 will account for all of
the remaining cases of familial melanoma, this mutation suggests that
other genes in this pathway may be excellent candidates, note the
scientists in the January issue of Nature Genetics.

Sequana said it plans to seek patent protection for its discovery and
would continue to study what role the CDK4 gene plays in other forms of
cancer.

PERSONALITY GENE DISCOVERED

WASHINGTON, DC - Two groups of scientists working in different
countries have found a link between a gene that affects brain chemistry
and a normal aspect of personality, reported Nature Genetics.

Researchers from Herzog Memorial Hospital in Jerusalem led by Richard
Ebstei, and the Laboratory of Clinical Science at the National
Institute of Mental Health, led by Jonathan Benjamin, independently
tested a hypothesis advanced by Robert Cloninger and colleagues at the
Washington University School of Medicine: that novelty seeking
behaviour is affected by the way brain cells process dopamine, a neural
messenger chemical.

Both groups detected a correlation between different D4 dopamine
receptor genes (D4DR) and variation in a human personality trait. D4DR
comes in various alternative forms, some in a long series of sequences
and some in short. Those individuals with the long sequence score high
in the novelty seeking personality trait, making them "more
exploratory, thrill-seeking and excitable", write the researchers.
Those who have the shorter sequence score lower in the novelty seeking
behaviour, "more deliberate, rigid and orderly."

"This work provides the first replicated association between a specific
genetic locus involved in neurotransmission and a normal personality
trait. Given the significant hereditary nature of many human behaviours
and the rapid progress of the human genome project, it is likely that
additional genes that influence normal and abnormal psychological
characteristics will be found in the future," noted the Israeli
researchers.

All subjects in the two studies differed in age, sex and ethnic
background. In fact, the scientists also found that the relationship
between the long sequence and novelty seeking did not vary with age,
sex or ethnic background.

The US researchers noted that although the findings in the two studies
were remarkably similar, they do not feel that "novelty seeking is
completely mediated by genes and that D4DR accounts for some but not
all genetic defects."

LQT SYNDROME GENE FOUND

SALT LAKE CITY, UT - Researchers from the University of Utah (UT) have
identified a gene which has been linked to a rare inherited heart
ailment known as long-QT (LQT) syndrome which can cause sudden death in
otherwise healthy people.

Reported in the January issue of Nature Genetics, Mark Keating and UT
colleagues found the third gene, KVLTI, linked to the most common form
of LQT, afflicting some 50 to 60 per cent of all cases.

"KVLTI turns out to be a potassium channel that is also most likely
involved in cardiac repolarisation", noted the scientists. Six months
previously, the UT researchers had identified a pair of genes
responsible for two other forms of LQT. These were also ion channels,
another potassium channel and a sodium channel. The researchers expect
that this more common form of LQT should be able to respond to drugs
that open potassium channels.

Rapid progress anticipated

"With the majority of LQT cases now at least partially understood at
the molecular level, there should be rapid progress in finding out how
to treat these disorders", the researchers noted.

LQT syndrome, although rare, is well-known because it often results in
sudden death. LQT can be worsened by the use of some drugs,
particularly those used treat cardiac arrhythmias. The danger of the
use of such drugs and the deadly nature of the disorder makes early
detection vital. Dr Keating said the discovery of the third gene will
help in the early diagnosis of LQT.

LQT syndrome affects some 20,000 people in the US and is believed to
cause up to 20 deaths a year.

BIOTECH STOCKS SET TO POWER AHEAD

LONDON - Analysts remain highly positive on the sector's outlook, with
some of the smaller capitalised stocks set to make their mark in 1996.

Stanford Rook, founded by two microbiologists from University College,
floated in April 1995 and subsequently transferred to the UK
Alternative Investment Market, has attracted growing support. The
company's lead product is the immunotherapeutic, SRL 172, a new
tuberculosis treatment currently in Phase III trials in South Africa
and Phase II trials in the UK. Development programmes include work on
the application of SRL 172 as a treatment for cancer and HIV. Shares in
Stanford Rock have soared since the start of the year, up from 265p at
the 1995 year end to 375p on the 16 January, valuing the company at #66
million.

David Kennard, managing director and ex-Glaxo Wellcome, said: "The lead
indication of our lead product is TB and associated HIV-related
infection. We are well into Phase III studies - a 400-patient placebo
controlled study. We hope to launch the product in 1998. Being an
orphan drug status product, we hope to get a favourable review upon
submission."

"They have got some serious credibility behind them", observed an
analyst. "The rumour is that they have got some licensing deal coming
out with a major pharmaceutical firm in the near future, and that they
are now making noises that their immune stimulant is effective in
fighting Aids".

Chiroscience gained 9p at 323p on the 16 January on news that it has
gained regulatory approval for Phase II clinical studies of its single
isomer treatment, D3967, for hormonally sensitive breast cancers. This
is the company's third single isomer drug to go into the clinic. "The
approval to start the trials is goods news in that the company can step
forward, but it does not mean that they have a result that shows it
works yet", explained an analyst. Chiroscience is nonetheless seen as
one of the strongest stocks in the UK biotech sector.

Also tipped as undervalued are Cortecs and Scotia. The latter has
suffered over the past few months on reluctance among some investors to
accept the company's science. The shares however gained 20p to 583p on
the 16 January. "Many see the company more as a nutritional OTC
business rather than a biopharmaceutical company. The management of
Scotia have got more science credibility than many of the rest in the
sector", noted one analyst.

Cortecs has the potential to be one of the sector's best performing
stocks in 1996. It is riding high on the prospects for three major
trends in the pharmaceutical industry - the increasing resistance of
bacteria to antibiotics, osteoporosis and diabetes management. "Cortecs
has a lot to go for in those three years. If it gets its oral
calcitonin drug licensed out, and launches its diagnostics on to the
market, I can see the share price more than doubling", opined one City
follower.

Recently floated issues appear to be performing well. Peptide
Therapeutics, at around 220p, is holding steady at a 10 per cent
premium over its flotation price. KS Biomedix is trading up 15 per cent
on its recent placing, price while PolyMasc Pharmaceuticals is up
almost a third on its initial placing in December.

US analysts expect the recent pick-up in the biotech sector to continue
throughout 1996. Stocks are expected to appreciate on an anticipated
flow of positive product development news, with US Food and Drug
Administration approvals expected to sustain the sector's positive
investment climate.

Somatogen, up $1-7/8 at $20-5/8 in early January, is seen as one of the
most promising US biotech firms. Late Phase II clinical trials on its
blood substitute product have shown positive results. If successful,
the product has a $1 billion-plus market potential. One analyst set a
12-month price target of $50 on the stock.

Liposome shares fell $1-1/8 to $20-7/8 on the 12 January on news that
one analyst forecast a 12-month price target of $7.

Salomon Brothers rates Amgen one of the year's star stock picks,
arguing that with an estimated average annual earnings growth rate of
more than 20 per cent between 1996 and 1998, the shares are
significantly undervalued. Trading at $55-1/8 last week, Salomon has
set a one-year price target of $65. Both old and new products are said
to be selling well. On the development front, clinical trials are
expected to start this year on Leptin, Amgen's anti-obesity drug and
GDNF, for Parkinson's disease. The company is also expected to initiate
a pivotal Phase III clinical trial of MGDF, the platelet growth factor,
within the next few months.
