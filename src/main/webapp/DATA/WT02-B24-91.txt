The post-school success rates of students who have learning 
disabilities, as a group, have not been what we would all hope even 
though many individuals have been highly successful. A recent focus 
on greater school responsibility for the post-school life of students 
who have disabilities has resulted in new transition requirements. 
The purpose of this discussion is to present a different approach to 
writing IEPs, with special attention to the transition component This 
approach results in IEPs which, unlike most IEPs, are both 
educationally useful and legally correct.
<h4>THE PROMISE</h4>
<p>
After nearly seventeen years of life the Individual Education Program 
(IEP)-- the heart and soul of the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act (IDEA) -- is still in it's infancy, it's great 
potential unrealized and unappreciated. The IEP process and product 
frequently have been distorted beyond recognition. The purpose of this 
discussion is to show how the IEP process can work to produce IEPs 
that are both educationally useful and legally correct. The essence 
of legal correctness is that the IEP is tailored precisely to all the
unique needs of the individual student. The core of educational 
utility is that the IEP spells out precisely how the school district 
will address each and every unique need and how it will determine 
whether and when a change in strategy or service is required. The IEP 
process must determine: 
<dl COMPACT>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 
  <dd>which needs or characteristics of the
      student require special education, i.e., individualization of 
      services; 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
  <dd>Precisely how the district will address each need, i.e., "what 
      special education, related services or modifications it will 
      provide; and 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
  <dd>how and when the efficacy of those services will be evaluated. 
</dl>
The IEP process must include the parent (or parent/student) as a full 
and equal partner, and a student whose IEP addresses "transition" 
must be invited to participate in the IEP process and must have her 
or his preferences and interests considered. These transition concerns 
and processes are a special focus of this discussion.
<h4>THE PRACTICE</h4>
<p>
Most IEPs are useless or slightly worse, and too many teachers experience the
IEP process as always time consuming, sometimes threatening, and, too often, a
pointless bureaucratic requirement. The result is a quasi-legal document to be
filed away with the expectation it won't be seen again except, heaven forbid,
by a monitor or compliance officer. The point of the IEP exercise seems to be
to complete the given form in a way that commit the district to as little as
possible, and which precludes, as much as possible, any meaningful discussion
or evaluation of the student's real progress.
<p>
Parents too often experience, the IEP process as an overgrown parent-teacher
conference in which the school personnel present some previously prepared
papers and request a signature. They may be told a few things about some
"rights." Parents who attempt to participate as equals are often intimidated
into acquiescence. They are frequently given false and outrageous distortions
such as, "We (the district) don't provide individual tutoring"; or "Speech
therapy is always done by the regular classroom teacher and the speech
therapist provides consultation services to her"; or "We are a full inclusion
school and have no special classes or resource rooms because we don't believe
in pull-out programs." When such limiting and blatantly illegal practices are
presented as if they are simple fact few parents are adequately prepared to
challenge the district.
<h4>A BETTER WAY</h4>
<p>
The IEP process and product can be both educationally useful and legally
correct. The first step toward that end is for the district to provide an
appropriate time and place for the IEP meeting, The place should be physically
comfortable and the meeting time and length appropriate. The law requires the
meeting be at a mutually agreed on time and place. Too often parents are not
aware they have any say in either. Districts must also be careful to avoid
unrealistically short meetings, especially for initial, complex or disputed
IEPs.
<p>
The only legitimate focus of an IEP meeting is on the special needs of the
student and how those are to be addressed. There may be a temptation for
district personnel to sidestep into policy explanations or justifications or
into what the parents have done or not done. If the student is not present at
the IEP meeting a strategically placed photo of the youngster can serve to
help all participants stay focused on the needs of that student. Many IEP
meetings lose this essential focus and wander, becoming inefficient and
frustrating for all.
<p>
The single most important principle of the IEP process is that the school must
appropriately address all the student's unique needs <em>without regard to the
availability of needed services</em>. Prior to the passage of IDEA (then P.L.
94-142) in 1975, schools were legally free to offer only the programs or
services, if any, they had available. Parents were supposed to be grateful for
anything at all that was provided. The primary purpose of the law was to turn
that squarely around and <em>entitle</em> the student who has a disability to
a free appropriate education individually designed to meet her or his unique
needs. Educators who have entered the field in the last twenty years lack this
historical perspective and too easily revert to the pre-IDEA mentality of
trying to stretch existing programs and services to fit the students. Instead
they must start with the student and design services to fit the student's
needs, however unique they may be.
<h4>THE PARTICIPANTS</h4>
<p>
Sometimes parents report that only a teacher was at the IEP meeting; other
times a seeming army of district personnel confront them. The law specifies
that in addition to the parent and student (if the parent so wishes) a teacher
of the student and a district representative must be present. The IDEA
regulations allow the district substantial discretion in determining which
teacher will be at the IEP meeting. Since, in theory, the IEP team is
addressing the student's needs above all, it would seem reasonable to select a
teacher who knows the student well. In addition, at least one team member
<em>must</em> be qualified (by state standards) in the area of the student's
disability. If this is not the teacher, it must be the district representative
(<em>Mcintire, 16 EHLR 163, (OSEP, 1990)</em>). Students at middle school or
high school most often have several teachers. The law does not require that
they all attend, but good special education practice suggests their input
should be sought and they most certainly should be informed of the IEP's
provisions.
<p>
The district representative must provide or be qualified to supervise special
education, have the authority to allocate district resources, and be able to
guarantee no administrative veto) of the IEP team's decisions (34 CFR Part 300
Appendix C, 13). These qualifications are the law's way of insuring that the
IEP team, and it alone, has the power to determine what services the student
needs and, therefore, will receive. The evaluation team, often called the
multi-disciplinary team, determines eligibility, but only recommends services.
<p>
All members of the IEP team should remember the enormous power and
responsibility that is theirs. When the IEP specifies a service is needed, the
district must provide it. Too often parents are given a very different
impression, i.e., that only what is already available can be provided and
often in smaller than needed amounts. This critical difference between the law
and practice is typified by the common situation, e.g., where the parent
believes the student who has a learning disability needs intensive,
individual, daily language therapy and is told by the speech therapist that
since the therapist is only in that building on Mondays and Wednesdays the
student will be included in an ongoing 20 minute speech therapy group on those
two days.
<p>
In addition to the parent (and perhaps student), teacher, and the district
representative, the first IEP meeting for a given student must be attended by
a member of the evaluation team or someone familiar with the evaluation. In
addition, either the district or the parent may invite anyone else. The
district must, however, inform the parent ahead of time of all district
invited persons who will be at the IEP meeting. There is no similar
requirement for parents to inform the district of anyone they may invite.
<p>
The fact the law does not require related services personnel to be present may
be highly significant. The IDEA regulations (34 CFR Part 300 Appendix C,
Question 23) advise that related service personnel provide written
recommendations to the IEP team about the nature, frequency and amount of
service to be provided. Arguably, there is no requirement that goals and
objectives are necessary for related services. If related service goals and
objectives are required they may be of the sort a teacher and parent could
write. Since related services include only those necessary to enable the
student to benefit from special education it stands to reason that the goals
and objectives to be accomplished by the related services would appear as
goals for the special education services. The focus on the related services
components of the IEP is on specifying the amount of service and the outcome
is reflected in the goals and objectives for special education. The related
services are not ends in themselves, but rather enablers.
<h4>CONTENTS OF THE IEP</h4>
<p>
The federal requirements for the contents of the IEP are straightforward. The
individualized education program for each child must include:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
<dd>A statement of the student's present levels of education performance;
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
<dd>A statement of annual goals, including short term instructional
objectives;
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
<dd>A statement of the specific special education and related services to
be provided to the student, and the extent to which the student will be able
to participate in regular educational programs;
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
<dd>A statement of the needed transition services for students beginning
no later than age 16 and annually thereafter (and if determined appropriate
for an individual student, beginning at age 14, or younger), including, if
appropriate, a statement of each public agency's and each participating
agency's responsibilities or linkages, or both, before the student leaves the
school setting;
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)
<dd>The projected dates for initiation of services and the anticipated
duration of the services; and
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)
<dd>Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and schedules
for determining, on at least an annual basis, whether the short term
instructional objectives are being achieved. (34-CFR 300.346).

<h4>LEGAL RULINGS ON IEPS</h4>
<p>
These five general principles, among others, emerge clearly from a review of
the hundreds of past IEP rulings from agencies and courts:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
<dd><em>All</em> of a student's unique needs must be addressed, not just her
or his academic needs, e.g., <em>Russell v. Jefferson Sch. Dist.</em>, 609 F.
Supp. 605,
(N.D. CA 1985); <em>Abrahamson v. Hershman</em>, 701 F.2nd 223, (1st Cir.
1983). Arguably, no "non-unique" needs have to be addressed.
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
<dd>The availability of services may not be considered in writing the IEP. If
a service is needed it must be written on the IEP and if the district does not
have it available, it must be provided by another agency. One of the earliest
of all the agency rulings mandated that availability of services be
disregarded in writing the IEP (<em>Leconte</em>, EHLR 211:146, OSEP, 1979).
This principle has been reiterated repeatedly by the Office of Special
Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) and the Office of Special
Education Programs (OSEP) and virtually ignored by the field.
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
<dd>The IEP is a firm, legally binding "commitment of resources." The district
must provide the services listed or the IEP must be amended (<em>Beck</em>,
EHLR 211:145 (OSEP 1979)).
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
<dd>IEPs must be individualized. The same goals, same content areas, same
discipline or the same amounts of therapy on many IEPs (e.g., every student
who receives speech therapy in a particular building receives 30 minutes
daily) reveals a violation of this individualization requirement (<em>Tucson,
AZ Unified Sch. Dist. #1</em>, EHLR 352.547 (OCR 1987)).
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<dd>(5) All of the components of the IEP required by law
(e.g., goals and objectives, specific special education and related services)
must be present.
