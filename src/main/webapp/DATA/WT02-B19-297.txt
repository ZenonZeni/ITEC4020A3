Talking Points For Your Visits With Congress</B><P>
<BR>
1)     <B>IDEA/Gifted Funding</B> <P>
<BR>
<li>Refer to the funding recommendations chart in the FY 1996 Federal Outlook for Exceptional Children (available through CEC); go over some of our recommendations for FY 1996.<BR>
<li>The Congress originally promised that the federal government would contribute 40% of the average per pupil expenditure (APPE) to help the states fulfill their obligation to education children with disabilities; however, the federal government is currently contributing only 8%.  CEC's recommendation to add $1 billion to the current Part B (State and Local Grant Program) allocation, for a total of $3,322.9 million for FY 1996, would raise the federal government's APPE to 11%.<BR>
<li>Currently, the federal government gives states approximately $400 per child receiving special educations services.  However, that amount fails to come near covering special education expenses -- from $7,000-$10,000 per student.  Therefore, states are having to pick up most of the costs of educating students with exceptionalities because of the lack of federal funds.  Without IDEA, even that small amount of $400 could be threatened.<BR>
<li>We need to increase the amount of funding for Part H of IDEA, the Early Intervention Program.  Congress enacted this program after evidence showed the importance of the earliest possible intervention for infants who are developmentally delayed or at risk of becoming so.  Funds invested now in the education of a child with a disability saves a lot of dollars later!<BR>
<li>The Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act is the only federal program designed to address the education of gifted and talented students.  The program places a priority on students who are disadvantaged, limited English proficient, and gifted children who have disabilities.  Under the current funding level, the Education Department can only fund 5% of the proposals it receives.  Therefore, CEC seeks an appropriation of $20 million for FY 1996 (an increase of $10.48 million).<BR>
<li>Preschool programs for children with disabilities (IDEA Part B -- Sec. 619) must be funded separately.  Blocking preschool funds together with state grant funds for children and adolescents through age 21 years would likely result in devastating and unacceptable cuts to preschool programs, and would threaten the very existence of preschool services in many states.<BR>
<li>The research training, technical assistance and demonstration program (EEPCD) should be maintained as a discreet, intact program.  This program has been evaluated as one of the best examples of research-to-practice in the federal government.  It provides innovative practices which feed the field with more effective ways of serving infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with special needs and their families.  The consolidation of this program together with other programs is likely to result in a substantial decreased emphasis on very young children and their families.<BR>
<li>The President's proposed consolidations into five programs of the current 14 IDEA support programs should be considered only within the context of regular IDEA reauthorization, and should not provide a basis for budget and appropriations action before reauthorization has occurred.<P>
2)     <B>IDEA Reauthorization</B><P>
<li>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is up for reauthorization in 1995.  While Part B is permanently authorized, programs like Early Intervention and Personnel Preparation must be reauthorized this year OR they would not receive further funding.<BR>
<li>Special education is critical to children with disabilities.  It helps them learn and become productive, independent members of society.  When a student with a disability receives an appropriate education, as required by IDEA, that student has a better chance of going on to postsecondary education or entering the work force, and becoming full tax paying members of society.  Without the special education services provided under IDEA, students would not learn the skills they need to live as independent adults.<BR>
<li>Talk about CEC's recommendations to the Congress to further strengthen services to children with disabilities; especially, reinforce the Parent/Professional Partnership.<P>
3)     <B>Unfunded Mandates</B><P>
<li>IDEA is not an unfunded mandate!  The obligation of states to provide education to children with disabilities was established in court cases before IDEA.  States would have to provide special education even without IDEA.  Therefore, the federal government is not "mandating" services to children with disabilities.  IDEA was drafted to help states meet the financial burden of meeting their Constitutional responsibilities.<P>
4)     <B>Personal Stories</B><P>
<li>Tell the congressional member about an exceptional child in their district.  Try to bring close to home the beneficial effects that special education can have for children with exceptionalities.
