<p><font size="3">The Warfare Against Opium-Smoking in America</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Last week the United States Senate passed the
Anti-Opium Bill. When it was brought up in the House, immediate
consideration was prevented by certain leaders, chiefly because
the bill, if passed, would involve a loss in revenue! The bill
forbids the importation into the United States, after April 1,
1909, of smoking opium in any form or any preparation or
derivative thereof. Opium, other than smoking opium, may be
imported for medicinal purposes only, under regulations which the
Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to establish.
Transgressors of the law are to be punished by the forfeiture of
the property and a fine of a sum not exceeding five thousand
dollars or less than fifty dollars, or by imprisonment for any
time not exceeding two years, or both. The Outlook has already
shown the necessity for the passage of such a bill. The special
necessity at the present time is evident from a telegram just
received by the Right Rev. Charles H. Brent, D.D., Bishop of the
Philippine Islands and Chairman of the American delegates to the
International Opium Conference which is about to meet at
Shanghai, China. Bishop Brent cables that, if this bill is not
immediately passed, every other nation of the twelve
participating nations will be in a better light as to recent
action in its own constituency than is our own. And yet our own
Department of State was the originator of the Conference! We urge
our readers to telegraph to their Congressmen requesting the
speedy enactment of the Anti-Opium Bill as passed by the Senate.
The provisions of the bill, which now awaits the action of the
House, give ample leeway for all necessary use of opium by
scientific or medical men.</font></p>
