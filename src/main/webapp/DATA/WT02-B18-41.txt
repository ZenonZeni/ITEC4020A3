	<STRONG>A new rapid approach to the identification and conservation of aquatic ecosystems.
</STRONG>




<P>
The state of knowledge about aquatic tropical ecosystems is weak in comparison with terrestrial ecosystems.  Despite this lack of information, major decisions affecting aquatic ecosystems are being made throughout the tropics.  AquaRAP assesses the conservation significance and status of key aquatic ecosystems.  A primary goal is to identify important regions for policy and decision makers and to make conservation recommendations that are locally appropriate and globally significant.


<P>
AquaRAP expeditions will analyze biological communities found in rivers, streams, lakes, springs or marshes, and adjacent environments that fall under aquatic influence such as floodplains and gallery forests.  The interface between aqua and terra and a hydrological overview will be principal to this broader context of the aquatic community, and is essential for conservation purposes.

<P>
In spite of contamination and depletion of fish populations, aquatic communities receive little conservation attention.  Fish provide the major source of protein for the majority of rural people throughout the wet tropics.  People who rely upon this source are severely impacted by deforestation, mercury pollution from gold mining, overfishing and elimination of large keystone predators such as giant otter and caiman.

<P>

Opportunities exist to facilitate change because many tropical countries such as Peru and Brazil are beginning to place a high priority on improving aquatic ecosystem conservation and belated science.  Collaboration with government agencies can now have a significant impact on the fate of these ecosystems.

<P>




AquaRAP has four important analysis levels:<P>
<OL>
  <LI><STRONG>Biodiversity and biogeographic significance</STRONG><BR>
		There is much uncertainty concerning the diversity of tropical fish faunas.  The Amazon Basin, the world's epicenter for freshwater fish has some  1500-1700 species described.  Recently it has been suggested that the actual species count might be as high as 9000 species.

	<P> 

 <LI><STRONG>Landscape ecology</STRONG><BR>
		Working beyond the body of water is crucial to this approach.  Maintaining the riparian corridor, as most indigenous cultures on blackwaters do, is crucial to human sustenance.  There are many associations between fish and trees in flooded forests.  Seasonal flooding is related to soil replenishment.  These interrelationships are critical for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms as well as the local economy.
<P>
  
<LI><STRONG>Physio-chemical analysis</STRONG><BR>
		The relationship between water chemistry, endemism and fish distribution is complex.  Such basics as how fish faunas differ between blackwater and whitewater systems are poorly known.  
<P>
 
<LI><STRONG>Human ecology</STRONG><BR>
		Human activities such as farming forestry, mining and fisheries are often major determinants of aquatic ecosystem health.  Indigenous societies have developed a number of adaptive systems that conserve aquatic fertility.  Recording this type of information is vital both for better scientific understanding and for documenting the human dependence on the resources and appropriate management.

The first ever AquaRAP expedition  took  place in September, 1996 near Cobija, Bolivia.  An International RAP Team with scientists from Bolivia, Peru, Brazil and the United States spent three weeks surveying the systems of the Tahuamanu and Manuripi rivers.  The founding and initiation of AquaRAP has been substantially funded by the <A HREF="http://www.wajones.org"> W. Alton Jones Foundation</A>.  With further support AquaRAP could be implemented to fill information needs and help set conservation priorities around the world.  

<P>

AquaRAP is a collaboration between Conservation International and <A HREF="http://www.bvis.uic.edu/museum/">The Field Museum of  Chicago</A>.
