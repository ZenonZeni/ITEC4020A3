<a name="CARE"><h3><b>Patient Centered Care</b><br></h3></a>

We understand that no two medical problems or patients are alike, and treatments must be individualized to every patient's needs.<p>

 That's why the medical staff of the ATLANTA REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTRE is committed to finding medical solutions for each person who seeks care from us.<p>

 We never attempt to fit an individual into a generic treatment mold.<p>

To provide the personalized quality care for which we've become nationally recognized, we spend hours with ourpatients and their partners to <p><dl><dd><I>First</I>, identify and diagnose the problem;<p><DD>

<I>Second</I>, develop a partnership with each patient and her support team which may include her husband, another relative or friend and her referring physician;<p><DD>

<I>Third</I>, outline medical or surgical options;<p><DD>

<I>Fourth</I>, initiate a cost-effective treatment plan that combines the highest quality of care with the best possible outcome.</dl><a name="CONFID"><p><h3><b>Confidentiality</b><br></h3></a>

We work hard to protect our patients' privacy. We do not release medical records or any portion of them without written authorization from the patient.<p>

<a name="HOURS"><h3><b>Office Hours </b><br></h3></a>



Our office is open Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. We try to be flexible for situations when it maybe necessary to see patients outside of regular office hours. Saturday and Sunday morning appointments are available for ultrasound monitoring, insemination, egg retrievals and pre-embryo transfers.<p>

<a name="STYLE"><h3><b>Open Communication</b><br></h3>

The best patient is a well-informed one.<p>

We value an open and ethical relationship with each patient who, we believe, is entitled to complete knowledge about her reproductive health.<p>

In an environment of trust and mutual respect, our patients and their partners feel free to ask questions at any time.<p>

We promise to answer all the questions asked -- and even those that aren't.<p>

It's the only way to build partnerships with every patient, her spouse and her referring physician. As a team, we allwork together to achieve the best possible outcome.<p>

<a name="PAY"><h3><b>Financial Matters</b><br></h3>

Most health insurers do not cover infertility. Conversely, many insurers will provide coverage for some gynecological diagnoses. However, we do not accept assignment for office visit charges unless we have a contract with your insurer or your health insurer's written authorization or referral for your appointment.<p>Payment for medical, lab and diagnostic services provided in the office is due at the time of service. If we have a managed care contract with your insurer, you are expected to pay for the deductible and/or co-pay at the time of service. To keep patient accounts current, we accept Mastercard, Visa and Discover cards or we will verify your personal check.<p>Depending on your diagnosis, you may be able to obtain some reimbursement for your care. Your receipt for payment will contain the standard diagnosis, medical and surgical treatment codes used by the majority of health insurers.



<p>





<a name="APPT"><h3><b>Your Appointment</b><br></h3>

<I><B>Step 1: </B></I>Call (404) 265-3662. Our staff conducts a preliminary telephone interview to assure that we are adequately prepared for the appointment. If necessary for insurance coverage, a referral authorization must be signed and in our office before an appointment can be scheduled.<p>

We attempt to see patients with urgent medical or surgical conditions as quickly as possible.<p>



<I><B>Step 2: </B></I>Once the appointment is scheduled, our staff sends the patient a Welcome Packet with detailed information about ATLANTA REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTRE. The packet also includes authorizations for release of medical information, and a new patient questionnaire for both partners to complete and bring the initial appointment.<p>

<I><B>Step 3: </B></I>Before the appointment, the Patient must take the authorization for release of medical information to her prior physician(s) and hospital(s) and obtain copies of relevant medical records. In addition, patients should obtain copies of<p>

<dl><dd>surgical notes and videotapes, <p><dd>actual (not copies, not reports) x-ray films, <p><dd>copies of laboratory tests,<p><dd>her health insurance manual.<p></dl>

Infertility evaluations require a spouse to sign a separate authorization for release of medical information to obtain copies of his records and semen analysis reports.<p>

All medical information should be delivered to ATLANTA REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CENTER for Dr. Perloe to review before your first appointment.<p>

For a fertility assessment, both partners should be present at the first appointment which usually takes two hours. This visit usually costs about $200 plus additional fees for lab or other diagnostic test which can run the total as high as $500. If you are not prepared for this expense at the time of your visit, you should let us know immediately so that additional testing can be postponed.<p>
