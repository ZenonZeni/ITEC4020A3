<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Your Spouse And Your Pension</STRONG></FONT><P>
 
You face a tough dilemma if you're in line for a pension at retirement. It could
cost you and your spouse
thousands of dollars and take a big chunk out of your children's inheritance.
<P>
It's called the "pension dilemma," because you may end up making a trade-off on
your pension -
deciding whether to take your full pension benefit and expose your spouse to a loss
of benefits at your
death, or taking less than your maximum benefit in exchange for continuing benefits
for your spouse. 
Fortunately, for many couples, there is a win-win third choice.  It's known as
pension maximization. But
first, the pension dilemma:  As an example, let's say you'll be eligible for a
$1,000 monthly pension
benefit at retirement.  That's the value of your benefit and the amount you will
receive under the "single
life option."  The only problem is that your benefits will be paid only as long as
you live.  At your death,
your pension benefits die with you.  That's fine if you're single, but not if
you're married.  Should you die
first, your spouse not only loses you, but also $12,000 a year in income.<P>
That's why, if you're like most people, you will select a "joint and survivor
option," which pays benefits as
long as either of you is alive.  Since your spouse has a legal claim to your
benefits, this is the option
automatically offered by law to married retirees.  Before you can elect another
option, you must both
agree in writing.<P>
However, the cost can be high.  Though the actual number depends on a number of
factors, a typical
$1,000 monthly benefit could be reduced significantly.  For the sake of
discussion,
if a "joint and full
survivor option" is selected, that "single life option" benefit of $1,000 could be
reduced by as much as
$250.  That adds up to $3,000 a year - $30,000 over a ten-year period - in lost
benefits. (See the
chart "Potential Benefit Loss Over 20 Years" below.)
<P>
<STRONG>Pension Maximization Option</STRONG><BR>
Then there is that third option - pension maximization.  The concept is fairly
simple.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Purchase a sufficient amount of life insurance on yourself prior to retirement,
naming your spouse
as beneficiary.  The death benefit is informally earmarked to replace the lost
pension benefit if you die
first.
<LI>At retirement, you and your spouse opt to take the single-life benefit option -
receiving your
maximum pension benefit for as long as you live.
<LI>Use a portion of the additional pension funds - the difference between the
amount for a single
versus a joint and survivor benefit - to pay the life insurance premiums.
</OL>
<P>
Life insurance rates are based primarily on age.  So, the younger you are when you
make this decision,
the lower your rates will be.  But pension maximization may also work even if you
are at or near
retirement.  The idea is to use a portion of your full pension benefit to pay the
insurance premium.  The
result can be a win-win situation for you, your spouse, and your heirs.  Here's
why:
<P>
<OL>

<LI>You receive the maximum pension benefits to which you are entitled.
<LI>Your spouse shares in your benefits.  Should you die first, even though your
pension stops, your
spouse's income continues in the form of insurance proceeds.  In fact, if you like,
these insurance
proceeds can be set up as an annuity - with income benefits guaranteed for life.
<LI>Should your spouse die first, your benefits will continue.  The life insurance
can be cashed in or the
beneficiary changed.
<LI>Cash values accumulate in your life insurance policy.  If you and your partner
live well into your
golden years, the insurance can protect other assets for your heirs.  In fact, no
matter what happens,
your estate can be protected, enabling you to pass assets on to your children,
grandchildren, or a
favorite charity.
</OL>
<P>
<EM>Is pension maximization right for you?</EM>  That depends.  There are many
factors that need to
be taken into
consideration,  including both your ages, health status, actual pension benefit,
and costs.  Still, you owe
it to yourself and your spouse to find out more.
<P>
<EM>Recommendation: </EM> Check with your pension plan administrator and find out
about your
projected
benefits under the straight life option.  Then ask what the decreased amount will
be each month to add
your spouse under a survivorship option.  Next, contact your New York Life agent to
discuss whether or
not pension maximization is a cost-effective choice you need to consider.  There's
no cost or obligation.

<STRONG>A Sampling of Benefit Options</STRONG>
<P>
<EM>Single Life Option:</EM>  Benefits continue for as long as the benefit
recipient lives, whether the
recipient lives
to age 66 or 106.  This option pays the maximum monthly benefit amount.
<P>
<EM>Joint and Full Survivor Option:</EM>  The same amount of benefit is paid for as
long as either
recipient is
alive.  However, that benefit amount will usually be lower than under the single
life option.  (Example:  A
single life benefit of $1,000 a month may be reduced to $750 a month under the
joint and full survivor
option.)
<P>
<EM>Joint and Reduced Survivor Option: </EM> Initial benefits are higher than under
the joint and full
survivor
option, but then continue after the death of one person at a reduced level,
generally 50 percent. 
(Example:  Joint benefit may be $850, continued at $425 a month to the survivor.)
