GAME THEORY AND THE LAW is an important book. It is important in the sense
that it will serve as a catalyst for an expanded use of game-theoretic models
in the study of law. It will be a book that people will one day recognize
as having had a considerable influence on its field. And it will receive
the praise that accompanies such influence. Happily, such influence will
be beneficial to the field of law and such praise will be richly deserved,
because GAME THEORY AND THE LAW is an extremely intelligent and thoughtful
text. I recommend it without reservation to students of law and politics
(and to those of law and economics, for that matter) and, more generally,
to students of game theory and strategic behavior. Baird, Gertner and Picker
set two goals for themselves in writing this book: (1) &quot;to introduce
the formal tools of modern game theory to a wide audience using a number
of classical problems ranging from tort and contract law to labor law, environmental
regulations, and antitrust&quot; and (2) &quot;to show how modern game theory
allows us to sharpen our intuitions and provides us with new ways of looking
at familiar problems.&quot; (p. xi) The authors achieve both of these goals
and more in a very impressive fashion. Their sophisticated grasp of the
intricacies of game theory as well as of the strategic dimensions of many
areas of the law is manifest throughout the volume. Their analysis is analytically
rigorous, but not mathematically complex. For those readers who are wary
of mathematics for one reason or another, I can assure you that the authors
are able to translate sophisticated and complex mathematical concepts into
fairly simple ones without failing to communicate the underlying point of
the concept.<BR>
<BR>
More importantly, one of the features of the book that is most striking
(and, for my part, most welcome) is the thoughtful and sensible manner in
which they approach the use of game theory. Unlike many proponents of game-theoretic
analysis, they do not present it as the only legitimate approach to social-scientific
analysis. The authors present game theory as a powerful tool that can be
used along with other approaches to enhance our understanding of the role
of law in social life. They straightforwardly acknowledge what many take
to be a criticism of game theory -- that game-theoretic models simplify
the reality of social interactions -- but they assert quite rightly that
such simplification is not a problem as long as we remain clear about why
we are using the model: to compare the possible effects of different legal
rules on those interactions. They suggest that &quot;[t]he test of a model
is whether it can hone our intuition by illuminating the basic forces that
are at work but not plainly visible when we look at an actual case in all
its detail.&quot; (p. 7) They also offer a reasonable response to another
oft-cited criticism of game-theoretic analysis -- the assumption of maximizing
self-interested behavior in writing: <BR>
<BR>
The basic assumption at the heart of this mode of analysis is not that individuals
are self-interested <BR>
<BR>
Page 180 follows:<BR>
<BR>
profit-maximizers or care only about money, but rather that they act in
a way that is sensible for them given their own tastes and predilections.
This assumption may not always hold in an individual case, because people
at times act in ways that are inconsistent and self-destructive. In general,
however, people make the best decisions they can, given their beliefs about
what others will do. (p. 11) <BR>
<BR>
They offer solid cautionary advice (especially in an extended discussion
in chapter six) about the care necessary to avoid using the wrong models
to analyze subtle social situations. (How many of us have wondered whether
the world really is one big Prisoner's Dilemma game?) Finally, throughout
their analysis they maintain a realistic view of the assumptions about the
world to which we commit ourselves when we employ game-theoretic solution
concepts, assumptions that may lead us to draw false inferences about the
effects of legal rules on strategic behavior. In discussing the move from
a less restrictive to a more restrictive solution concept, the authors note
that &quot;we must assume more about what individuals know and more about
how they believe others will act. The more we have to make such assumptions,
the less certain we can be that our model will accurately predict the way
individuals behave.&quot; (p. 13)<BR>
<BR>
Having set forth their understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of
game-theoretic analysis in their early discussion, Baird, Gertner and Picker
proceed in the course of the book to make a powerful case for the value
of the approach. To give an adequate sense of the sheer breadth of their
coverage, I will merely outline the issues -- both game-theoretic and legal
-- that they address in their eight chapters. In the first chapter they
present the basic assumptions of strategic behavior and introduce static
games and their basic solution concepts (including Nash); they discuss tort
laws governing negligence and the duty of due care. In the second chapter
they incorporate time into the analysis and begin a consideration of extensive
form games (including an exceptionally clear and informative explication
of the subgame perfect solution concept); they demonstrate the relevance
of models of ongoing interactions in the areas of antitrust law and debtor-creditor
relations. In chapters three and four they introduce the complexity of incomplete
information, the realistic assumption that there is important information
relevant to the social interaction that is unknown to either one or both
of the actors. The authors call incomplete information &quot;the central
problem in game theory and the law.&quot; (p. 2) From a strategic perspective
they develop the issues of unraveling, signaling, screening, the crucial
role of beliefs in games of incomplete information and the basic incomplete
information solution concept, perfect Bayesian equilibrium, and some of
its refinements; from a legal perspective the authors show how incomplete
information influences the effect of legal rules in such areas as plant
closing laws, parental leave provisions, disclosure laws, inquiry limits
(including a provocative discussion of the <BR>
<BR>
Page 181 follows:<BR>
<BR>
Americans with Disabilities Act) and various laws that govern contracts
that envision future renegotiations. In chapters five and six they consider
a set of issues related to problems of collective action and cooperative
behavior. The game theoretic issues included in these chapters include repeated
games, the problem of multiple equilibria, the folk theorem, the effect
of reputation and mechanism design; the legal issues include the Statute
of Frauds and antitrust regulations governing predatory pricing and tacit
collusion. In the last two chapters the authors introduce distributional
considerations including an explication of non-cooperative bargaining theory
(both the classic Rubenstein model and various models which incorporate
assumptions of incomplete information); then they demonstrate the value
of these models for understanding bankruptcy law (including the provisions
governing automatic stays and the new value exception), labor law (restrictions
on hiring permanent replacement workers) and rules of civil procedure (including
provisions covering pre-trial discovery procedures and rules dictating the
structure of hearings and trials.)<BR>
<BR>
But even more than through their comprehensiveness, the authors' case for
the value of game theory is made through the creativity of their analysis.
To highlight this creativity, I will briefly discuss two examples of the
significant insights which they offer. First, as I have previously stated,
the problems related to information are, in the minds of the authors, fundamental
to law. They emphasize the importance of the distinction between verifiable
and nonverifiable information. Through their analysis of social interactions
that are characterized by these different types of information, they demonstrate
one of the major insights of their analysis: legal rules intended to affect
the communication of private information (that is, information known to
only some of the actors involved in an interaction) will have different
effects depending on whether or not the information is verifiable (by either
the other actors or a court.) An especially striking feature of this insight
is captured in their claim &quot;[t]o understand the effects of a legal
rule, we must pay attention to the way it affects not only actions that
the parties actually take, but also actions that they would not have taken
even in the absence of a legal rule.&quot; (p. 156) Here the value of the
use of game theory is most telling because this particular insight is explicitly
derived from the implications of the game-theoretic concept of off-the -
equilibrium path beliefs (basically, the idea that people are often affected
in how they will act by their expectations of what those with whom they
interact will do if they themselves were to act differently.) Through a
set of legal examples analyzed by a simple model of incomplete information,
the authors show that the law can influence behavior by establishing rules
that prohibit behavior that the actors would not do even if the rule was
not in place. For example, in a situation in which employers are known to
discriminate against disabled job applicants, the authors find that the
equilibrium outcome is that disabled applicants misrepresent their disabilities
and thus employers treat all applicants similarly. When the authors introduce
a rule that prohibits discrimination based on disability, the equilibrium
outcome changes to one in which the disabled workers reveal their disabilities
and the employer adopts a work plan that differs for disabled and nondisabled
workers and which produces a superior <BR>
<BR>
Page 182 follows:<BR>
<BR>
outcome for both workers and the employer. Thus, a rule that prohibits an
action that the employer would not even take if the actors were being strategically
rational nonetheless produces a change in behavior that is socially optimal.<BR>
<BR>
Second, the authors show how game-theoretic analysis can provide insights
into how we might make mistakes in our analysis of the effects of legal
rules. Their analysis shows that studies of the effects of discovery rules
on civil litigation will misconstrue those effects if they focus merely
on the cases that go to trial. The authors demonstrate a selection bias
in such a study sample. By analyzing the strategic effects of discovery
rules on pre-trial negotiations, the authors show that some discovery rules
have the effect of causing those parties who are most likely to be liable
to settle their cases before trial, thus selecting out those cases most
likely to result in a judgment for the plaintiff. Because of this pre-trial
effect, the cases that do actually go to trial are disproportionately those
most likely to lead to a judgment for defendants (because people who know
that they are not liable are the ones least likely to accept a settlement
offer.) If analysts were to base their investigation of rules of civil procedure
merely on the cases that go to trial and judgment, they would, on the authors'
analysis, fail to capture important effects of these rules. This selection
bias is clarified by the use of a simple game-theoretic model of litigation.<BR>
<BR>
These are merely two examples from a wealth of insights offered by Baird,
Gertner and Picker. The persuasiveness of their general argument for the
utility of game theory derives from a combination of the power of their
insights along with the sensibility of their analysis. The book is written
in a clear, concise and interesting manner. Its bibliographic references
render it a source book for additional research in both game theory and
law. This is a book that should be read by scholars of law in particular
and scholars of political behavior in general. One of the best compliments
that I can give it is that it would also be a profitable investment for
those who focus primarily on formal models of strategic behavior and games.
