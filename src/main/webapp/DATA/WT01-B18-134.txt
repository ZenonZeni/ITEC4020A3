Anyone who is a serious transit rider knows the virtues
of a car. Cars are ready when you are; they go where you
are going. Buses, subways, and light rail instead force
you to operate on their schedule and route. It is no
wonder that many transit systems are in a death spiral:
declining use results in reduced revenue, which leads to
worse service and further declining use.
<P>
The decline in transit mirrors the huge public
investments in highways and auto facilities. Since the
1950s, federal policies--ranging from the Interstate
Highway Act to mortgage tax deductions--have induced
sprawl at the expense of the city. The imbalance between
the car and its alternatives needs to be righted. 
<P>
As this essay describes, the very popularity of the car
is limiting its usefulness, both for those stuck in
endless congestion and for those who cannot drive but
must live and work in an automobile topography. 
<P>
One short-term and two long-term strategies will make
transit attractive. First, system managers and local
political leaders need to inject funds into public
transit to make it safer, cleaner, and more reliable.
The New York City subway system has recently undergone
such a transition: Trains are, on the whole, now free of
graffiti. They are safer, cleaner, and more dependable.
Certainly the New York subway system still needs
improvement, but the trend is in the right direction.
New York's commuter trains have shown even more
improvement. In other cities, such as Philadelphia and
Chicago, supreme effort should be made to prevent the
dismantling of existing systems, which would be
extremely expensive to replace.
<P>
The longer-run solutions tie into the previous section
of this essay and the one following. The form of the
metropolis ultimately limits the usefulness of the
transit system. It is difficult or impossible to build
transit systems that economically serve low-density
developments; rebuilding cities through infill
development makes transit systems viable. Perhaps more
importantly, good transit systems can induce
"transit-oriented development," which inverts the
public-transit death spiral.
<P>
Finally, we have to consider the economic signals that
car drivers and transit users face. Purchasing a car and
paying for its insurance are the two largest costs of
driving. Those costs are fixed whether the car is used a
little or a lot. The costs that vary with auto use--such
as oil, tires, and tolls--amount to only 20 percent of
automobile operating costs. Once someone buys a car, it
costs them very little to drive it.
<P>
Transit is the opposite. Tickets for the bus, subway, or
train are usually purchased for every ride. Even if the
total cost of using transit is less than that of owning
and driving a car, the marginal costs are often much
higher.
<P>
To give more accurate price signals, good public policy
would shift auto expenses from the fixed to the variable
column. For example, insurance could be paid on a
per-mile basis, with the information taken from annual
odometer readings. The varying price would more
accurately reflect the varying risk--which, after all,
grows with every mile driven. Similar ideas have been
proposed for congestion. Users now pay nothing to use
most roads, so there is no incentive to use them
judiciously. If some general taxes were reduced in
exchange for "congestion pricing"--charging drivers
directly for using roads--there would be far fewer
traffic jams, less pollution, and less waste.
<P>
Perhaps the most important inaccurate price signal is
that for gasoline which, at one-fourth European levels,
fails to account for the pollution it leaves when
burned, or the wars it sparks in the Mideast. These
"external" costs--estimated by some at more than $300
billion per year--are now borne by children with lung
disease and farmers with stunted crops, not by those who
benefit from the cheap gas.  If pollution were taxed
directly, it would be possible to reduce other taxes
while cleaning the air.
<P>
All the policies described in this essay would more
naturally fall into place if prices accurately reflected
true costs <A HREF = "truecosts.html" name="true">(see "The true
costs of driving.")</A>. Cleaner cars and cleaner fuels
would become cheaper. Driving to distant suburbs would
be more expensive, and the value of pedestrian-friendly
communities would rise. Transit would become a more
economical choice.  But there are great forces
maintaining the current price system. Americans  are
used to cheap gas and distrustful of taxing politicians.
And it would be profoundly unfair to change price
signals if those changes left the poor worse off.
<P>
Many sound arguments exist for using better price
signals to resolve the transportation dilemma. General
Motors and Chrysler have advocated higher gas taxes as a
wiser solution than fuel-efficiency standards. The
National Academy of Sciences believes that congestion
pricing--charging for the use of highways during peak
traffic hours--would save billions of dollars.
Environmentalists have long argued that polluters should
pay for the damage they cause.
<P> 
But commuters do not understand the reasons for charging
for a road their tax dollars already built. And for
lower-income citizens, any policy that raises the cost
of living is a direct threat to their livelihood.
<P>
Better price signals are conceptually elegant, but they
have so far failed virtually every political test.
Unless policies can be designed so that they produce
benefits-such as income tax relief-directly to those
paying the new fees, they have little chance of being
enacted. The challenge, then, is to create pricing
policies that are an integral part of tax reform. Such
policies must not impose new burdens on the poor or
middle class: indeed, when they are truly economically
efficient, they should generate net benefits that can
then be distributed to different income classes.
<P>
