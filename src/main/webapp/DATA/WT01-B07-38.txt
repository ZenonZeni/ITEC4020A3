<H2>18th Annual AIVC Conference</H2>
<HR>

<H2>First Announcement and Call for Papers</H2>

<H3>GREECE (Venue to be announced)</H3>

<H3>Tuesday 23rd to Friday 26th September 1997</H3>

<P>
Hot climates and high building heat gains both contribute to the
need for the cooling of indoor spaces. In an effort to control
energy demand, much research is focusing on techniques aimed at
minimising the need for refrigerative cooling. These approaches
are invariably linked to ventilation techniques and air movement.
The objective of this conference is to review current developments
in this area of activity.
<P>
Abstracts of approximately <B>300 - 500 words </B>are invited
on the following, or related, topics and should be submitted by
<B>February 17th, 1997</B>. Notification of acceptance or rejection
of the abstract will be sent at the beginning of April 1997 and
the deadline for final papers will be <B>July 31st 1997.</B>
<P>
Specific areas of interest include:
<UL>
<LI>ventilation for cooling
<LI>night cooling
<LI>architectural strategies
<LI>strategies for non residential buildings
<LI>strategies for dwellings
<LI>impact of air infiltration
