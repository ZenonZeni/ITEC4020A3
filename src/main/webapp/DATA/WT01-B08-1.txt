TO FRICTIONS WITH BRITISH PRESS</strong></font><font face="Arial"> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>STANLEY. (MP).- Oil has yet to be
found and in commercially sustainable volumes, but controversy
has already taken off</strong>. First it was Tony Lloyd, Labour
MP and shadow spokesman for the area who after a short visit
suggested that the islands would have to pass on to the British
Treasury some of the enormous revenue expected from the coming
oil bonanza. This was followed by reports from British
journalists, guests of the islands' government, who indicated the
possibility of a 1,1 billion pounds oil revenue in twenty years
time, and wondered what could this mean for the personality and
unique life style of the Falklanders. The Times went further and
in an editorial reminded the islanders that &quot;<em>citizens
have as many obligations as rights, the main of which is to pay
taxes according to their means</em>&quot;. Although a colony
islanders are full British citizens. The Falklands-Malvinas
government, in spite of the recent optimism about oil, has tried
to down play the controversy by arguing that it's not possible to
pretend a fixed rate, &quot;<em>when we still don't know how much
we will be receiving</em>&quot;. Councillors on the other hand
confirmed in a release that &quot;<em>it was on their own
initiative that they wrote a letter two years ago to the British
government offering to defray the cost of the defence of the
Falkland Islands should a sufficient quantity of oil be found</em>&quot;. </font></p>
