<font size=+2>The Advantages of Investing in Dividend Funds</font>

</center>


<blockquote>

Many retirees in Canada have been watching their income dwindle as
interest rates declined during most of the '90's.  Since their
investments have traditionally been in GIC's their income has
decreased dramatically, in some cases up to 50% over the last six
years.  In the early '90's, one year GIC rates were close to 10%
while today's rates are now lower than 5%.  Furthermore, it is widely
believed that we are entering a prolonged period of low interest
rates due to the deficit reduction programs being implemented in
most industrialized nations.<p>

If you and your spouse are both retired and qualify for full CPP
and OAS, your approximate annual income from government pension
plans is approximately $12,000.  If you have little or no
additional company pension, a significant portion of your income
must be derived from investments (RRSP/RRIF's or non-registered
investments).  Obviously the best strategy is to keep money in a
registered portfolio so that taxation on this money is postponed
for as long as possible.  Your RRSP/RRIF portfolio grows faster
since a portion of your return is not paid to the taxman each year
and is thus allowed to compound tax free until withdrawn.<p>

With low interest rates GIC investing increases the risk that you
might outlive your money.  As an alternative consider investing
non-RRSP money in investments which earn dividend income as opposed
to interest income.<p>

The above strategy is very powerful.  Why?  In Canada, tax rates
differ not only according to the size of your income, but also
among types of income. The following table illustrates the marginal
tax rates in Ontario on various types of income.

It is clear that the most tax favoured type of income outside
registered portfolios are dividends. In all income brackets, tax
rates on dividend income is the least.  Tax savings on dividend
income is the largest for people with an annual income of $29,590
or less.  While some seniors have higher incomes than that, many
fall within this range.<p>

Using investments which earn you dividend income may reduce your
taxes significantly.  For example, a couple each receiving pension
income of $12,000 a year, and having $200,000 in non-registered
investments, would have taxes on investment income calculated as
follows:

<table>

<tr>

<td> </td><td align=center>Invested in GIC<br>earning @ 5% per year</td><td align=center>Invested in Dividend<br>Mutual Funds @ 8% per year</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Income</td><td align=right>$10,000</td><td align=right>$16,000</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Tax</td><td align=right>$2,746</td><td align=right>$1,184</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>Net Income</td><td align=right>$7,260</td><td align=right>$14,816</td>

</tr>

</table><p>

Dividend income may be derived from holding shares in large
established Canadian corporations which have paid out dividends
consistently for a considerable time (ie: Banks).  Or you might
want to buy a dividend mutual fund which is professionally managed
and invests in these types of companies.  In both cases the
dividend payout is approximately 8% per year.  While dividends are
not guaranteed, these companies - in which you - or even better -
your mutual fund manager invest, are long established profitable
corporations. Therefore, annual return fluctuations on this type of
investment is minimal compared to many other types of investments
(ie: equity mutual funds).  If you look at the performance of
available Canadian dividend mutual funds you will see that their
performance has been consistent, and over the long term, better
than that of GIC's.<p>

The above strategy enables you to increase your after tax income,
your capital appreciation, or both.  Therefore you reduce the risk
of outliving your money.<p>
The new investment environment in the 90's, with low inflation and
low interest rates requires a fresh new approach.  After years of
hard work it's now time to retire, relax and have your money work
for you for a change.<p>
