<A name="point"></A>
<H2><A name="point">Securing Point-to-Point Applications</A>
</H2><P>A "point-to-point" application is any program that establishes a
direct link between two machines.
Groupware, telephony, FTP, Telnet, videoconferencing programs, and client/server
systems are all examples
of point-to-point applications, as they all establish direct connections
from one machine to another.  (E-mail
systems are not usually point-to-point applications, as most of them route
messages via intermediary machines.  See 
<A href="#mail">below</A> for more on securing e-mail systems.)
<P>
Once NetShade has been installed on two machines, <B>any</B> information
exchanged directly between those machines --
regardless of which application is used to send the data -- will be automatically
and invisibly encrypted.  It doesn't
matter how the two machines are connected (Internet, LAN, VAN, WAN, serial
link, etc.): as long as the link is 
bi-directional, and as long as the information is exchanged using the operating
system's TCP/IP network support, all of
the information shared between those machines will be encrypted.  For example,
installing NetShade on an FTP server
or other Internet host will allow any NetShade user to establish an encrypted
link with that host.
<P>
Since NetShade encrypts data at the protocol level, you won't need to modify
any of the applications you use to
exchange data.  Once NetShade is installed and configured on all the machines
that communicate via point-to-point applications,
you can keep using those applications in the same way that you use them now
-- the only difference 
is that with NetShade, the applications will be exchanging data across
<B>secure</B> channels.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="mail"></A>
<H2><A name="mail">Securing E-mail Systems</A>
</H2><P>NetShade is designed to establish a secure TCP/IP connection from
your machine to any other machine that is
running NetShade.  This "point-to-point" security is automatically applied
to any application that sends data directly from one
machine to another.  However, most e-mail systems don't send messages directly
to the addressees' machines; instead,
they use a technique called "store and forward."  This makes e-mail systens
slightly more difficult to protect than applications 
supporting point-to-point communication.
<P>
When you send a message to somebody using a "store and forward" e-mail system,
it is first routed to an intermediate
machine called a <B>mail server</B>.  Your mail server determines which mail
server the message recipient is using,
and routes your message to that mail server.  Usually, the message is stored
on the recipient's mail server until the
recipient retrieves it.
<P>Since NetShade requires direct contact between two machines to establish
a secure channel
between those machines, and since store-and-forward never puts the e-mail
sender in direct contact with the e-mail
recipient, an extra step is needed to secure the message in transit (see
Figure 1 below).
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="sampf1.GIF" WIDTH="690" HEIGHT="323"></CENTER>
<P>
Once NetShade has been installed on the intermediate mail servers, any e-mail
routed between those servers
can be secured in a simple three-step process.
For example, if Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob, NetShade should
be installed on her mail server and on Bob's mail server.
When Alice sends the message, her copy of NetShade encrypts the message <B>for
her mail server</B>, not for Bob.  Alice's
mail server decrypts the message when it arrives, and then immediately
re-encrypts the message for Bob's mail server; 
again, the message is decrypted by Bob's server upon arrival.  When Bob retrieves
his 
e-mail from the mail server, the mail server encrypts it for Bob's machine;
Bob's machine decrypts the e-mail when it
arrives.  Of course, the entire process happens automatically, without any
need for user intervention.
<P>
Although Alice's message has been unencrypted twice en route to Bob's machine,
the points of greatest vulnerability --
the network pathways -- are completely secure.  Nevertheless, this scenario
underscores the need to combine
NetShade with a strong local encryption product (such as
<B><A HREF="www.rsa.com">RSA Secure</A></B>) in any situation where network
data
will be stored on a hard drive.
<P>

<A name="web"></A>
<H2><A name="web">Establishing a Secure Web Site</A>
</H2><P>If NetShade is installed on a machine running a Web server, any other
NetShade user will be able to access that 
Web site securely.  As soon as authentication services are available (with
version 2.1), server administrators will also be able to use NetShade to
restrict
access to private Web sites.
<P>
NetShade provides a level of security similar to that offered by the Secure
Sockets Layer
(SSL) security protocol.  However, NetShade is cheaper, more flexible and
more easily maintained than the SSL system,
which requires applications and servers to be modified at the source code
level before their data can be secured.  Compare 
this to NetShade's "plug-in" functionality, which adds security to all of
your TCP/IP applications at once when it is installed.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="lan"></A>
<H2><A name="lan">Securing a Local Area Network</A>
</H2><P>While many people already realize that Internet traffic can easily
be targeted by intruders, few realize that a similar
situation exists on local area networks.  But as more and more organizations
experience internal security breaches
(where trade secrets are intercepted and stolen by an employee), LAN security
systems must become better able to 
defend against internal eavesdropping attacks.  NetShade can protect LAN
traffic just as easily as it
protects Internet data.  See Figure 2 below.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="sampf2.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
Installing NetShade on every networked machine across a TCP/IP LAN will add
an invisible blanket of security to the
entire network.  All of the network services and applications are used in
exactly the same way, but the network data
-- including e-mail, shared files, client/server sessions, etc. -- is encrypted
to defend against eavesdropping attacks.  
Note that since NetShade encrypts data at the protocol level, any of the
machines on this LAN can still
communicate securely with other NetShade users across the Internet.
<P>
NetShade 2.0 will work with TCP/IP intranets. &nbsp;Future versions of NetShade
will be adapted to offer protection for other types of networks: AppleTalk,
IPX/SPX, and others.
(Note that <A HREF="netshade11.html">NetShade version 1.1</A> can already
be used to encrypt Appletalk LAN traffic).
<P>

<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<A name="group"></A>
<H2><A name="group">Securing a LAN Workgroup</A>
</H2><P>If you are not interested in securing all of the machines on your
LAN, NetShade can easily be scaled back to protect
a smaller workgroup.  Any network data shared among members of this workgroup
will automatically be encrypted; you can
configure NetShade to allow unencrypted connections between the workgroup
and non-NetShade users, or to reject any
attempts at unencrypted communication.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="sampf3.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
NetShade's flexibility of scale makes it the most cost-effective way to protect
a subset of your network.  Since NetShade
is a self-contained system, it can be managed entirely within its group of
users.  And of course, it can easily be scaled
up to protect the rest of the LAN as your organization's security needs change.
