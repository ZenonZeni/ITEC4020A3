-DIFFICULT YEAR AHEAD FOR ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-DIFFICULT YEAR AHEAD FOR
ONLINE SERVICE PROVIDERS
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

New research from TFPL says that 1996 is going to be
a difficult year for the new online service providers
who are expecting to cash in on the European service
market.  The study compares the European market model
to the USA and notes that the main US services such
as CompuServe, America Online and Prodigy have had
subscriber loyalty before the widespread use of the
Internet whereas in Europe service providers face
competition from the Internet as wekk as from free
public teletext services, videotex services and
localised online services.  Martin White, managing
consultant at TPFL, said: "Companies are tying to
take advantage of the rapidly growing installed base
of PCs in both the business and consumer markets
without fully understanding cultural issues about
information use. You only have to look at the way in
which the newspaper industry differs in each country
to see one example of the way in which online
services will have to adapt to each national market.
-- the evidence from the French Teletel services is
that users are more inclined to use the services for
transactions, rather than just for information."

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-DIGITAL INTRODUCES INTERNET
RESCUE SERVICE
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Digital Equipment Corp's Multivendor Customer
Services business unit has introduced a new service
aimed at Internet users called the PC Rescue Service.
Subscribers will be given access to a dedicated
hotline where technicians will solve any Netscape or
Mosaic Internet access problems and any PC hardware,
software or peripheral problem for any major brand of
PC hardware and software, irrespective of what system
and network operating system used.  David Allen,
marketing director of Digital's MCS unit, said: "In
our most recent research we discovered that more than
one in four people had difficulties in learning to
use and understand computers -- many of these have
bought a PC to access the Internet. Fourteen percent
of people have also experienced major breakdowns and
systems crashes -- which proves the industry still
needs to provide comprehensive support and rescue
services like PC rescue, if we are going to continue
to have a satisfied and rapidly growing Internet user
community." Yearly subscription costs are GBP117.50
with calls charged at GBP20 per incident. Members who
join before March 1996, will receive 5 free calls -
making membership almost free.

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-CABLE ONLINE GOES FOR UK
 CABLE CO' NET SERVICE
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Yet another new Internet service provider has gone
online, although this company claims to have a
different unique selling proposition to the rest.
Cable Online, a business unit of cable TV and
telephony service vendors CableTel, is planning to
leverage its business contacts within the cable
sector to provide Internet services over the regular
PSTN and cable phone networks around the UK.  The
company is confident of success and has claimed it
will be the number one Internet provider by the end
of 1997 with the key being its massive supply of
bandwidth, access points, scalable system and
support. Philip John, managing director of Cable
Online said: "In partnership with CableTel, we have
put our considerable telecomms resources and
expertise behind the service and placed great
emphasis on customer care.  We're confident that
disgruntled customers will move to us from other
service providers and that we will also attract a
healthy number of 'newbies'." Untimed service will be
charged at GBP12.95/month for dial-up access and free
technical support is offered on a toll-free number. A
number of local call points of presence are set to be
introduced with 90% UK local call penetration by mid-1996.
ISDN and leased line services are also being
offered although pricing information has yet to be
released.

-MICROSOFT FACES HOSTILE EUROPEAN RECEPTION AFTER
EURO ONLINE VENDORS ALIGN

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-MICROSOFT FACES HOSTILE
EUROPEAN RECEPTION AFTER EURO ONLINE VENDORS ALIGN
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Microsoft Corp's presently lacklustre plans to move
in the European online communications market with its
Microsoft Network seems to have been hit for six
after Germany's biggest media and telecommunications
companies joined forces with the world's largest
online services company to head off Microsoft.
Deutsche Telekom AG, Bertelsmann AG, Axel Springer
Verlag and America Online have signed letters of
intent to cooperate in online service provision and
operation. While not everything is yet cut and dry as
the proposal will require tight scrutiny from
Europe's competition watchdog, many observers point
out that the EU is likely to be favourable to the
deal in view of the threat from Microsoft Corp. 
While Internet service providers around Europe will
be marginally affected by the service, the new group
plans to introduce mainly content-based services,
placing it in direct competition with Microsoft's
Microsoft Network and CompuServe.  A complex range of
stock swapping is set to take place between the
partners to strengthen the deal. Possibly to placate
the watchdogs, the companies have stated that they
have no immediate intention to merge their own
extensive individual online services into one unit --
although of course they have denied to rule this out
as an option. Microsoft was also slated in a research
report note from Goldman Sachs claims that failure by
Microsoft to  articulate an Internet strategy' could
 ...weigh heavily on investors.' Goldman Sachs & Co.
cut its rating on the software giant.  Goldman has
removed Microsoft from its recommended list for top-rated stocks
and cut its rating from buy to moderate
outperformer. It is understood that the analyst cut
the stock because of Microsoft's failure to develop a
compelling Internet strategy which could dampen
upward movement in the stock during the next six
months, noting the expectation of an important
Internet strategy announcements from Microsoft in
about six months. Separately Microsoft has announced
that it has released the beta version of its
Microsoft Internet Information Server for Windows NT
-- more commonly known as Gibraltar -- to around
1,000 test sites worldwide and a second beta phase to
15,000 sites before a 1Q'96 launch.

One of the first moves by a non-British company into
the UK Internet service provision market has been
launched.  KPN Multimedia has launched Planet
Internet UK -- KPN is a subsidiary company of PTT
Telecom Netherlands -- who intends to invest over
GBP10m in the next two years in the UK.  A formal
launch is set for April 1996. John O'Sullivan,
marketing director of Planet, said that the company
believes it will win business through its policy of
making the offering  jargon-free' and user-friendly. 
The company is offering a taster to its service
whereby for a GBP4.99 fee access is provided until
the new year. Once the service is launched the
service will be priced at GBP9.99 per month for five
hours and GBP.04p/minute thereafter.

SLOW TO TAKE-UP INTERNET
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

European retailers are failing to take advantage of
the real potential advantages of Internet-based
retail services such as remote shopping, promotions
and customer awareness, according to research carried
out by Cap Gemini Sogeti/Hoskyns. The survey polled
46 of the top 200 retailers across Europe, noting
that while 90% are already connected on to the
Internet or seriously considering its benefits, use
of the Internet differs between retail sectors. The
fashion industry, for example, is failing to see the
benefits while mail order and wholesale ventures are
booming. Marc Peters, retail sector manager at
Hoskyns, said that despite the perceived advances,
retailers are not yet utilising the full potential of
the Internet and that current interest is mainly
exploratory.  Most of the companies who are trialing
the Internet have low expectations, with half-percent
of turnover being the expected rate of return within
two years and four percent over 10 years.  The survey
polled users on the main perceived barriers to net
trading with too few users topping the list at 59%
followed by Internet users are not the target markets
(57%), concerns over financial security (43%) and
lack of delivery infrastructure (39%). Separately,
telecommunications companies are failing to make the
most of the Internet's WWW despite being at the
forefront of most technical developments -- that is
the claim of a new survey conducted for Wollongong
Group. Wollongong polled 300 businesses and
discovered it was only the IT industry sector which
sees real commercial benefits from the Internet's
WWW. The survey, when split into industry sectors,
noted that while 30% of respondents were from IT
firms, only 8% where from telecommunications-related
companies.

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-CALL MADE FOR UNIVERSAL
ELECTRONIC MAIL ACCESS
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

A call has been made by the Rand Corp in a new study
for all Americans to be given equal access to
electronic mail. Rand says that private and
government policy makers should work together to
bring all Americans -- irrespective of income -- onto
the information superhighway, enabling them to reap
the considerable benefits over time.  Rand highlights
what it says is a growing number of  information
elite' parties which is made up of well-off
individuals with access to computers that can
transmit and receive e-mail.  According to Rand: "As
e-mail becomes more pervasive, as more commercial and
government transactions in the United States take
place online, those information haves may leave the
have-nots further behind, unless we make concerted
efforts today to provide all citizens with access to
the technology."  Amongst the ideas passed by Rand
for getting the less well-off onto e-mail are
recycling of old (lower specification) computers and
associated software should be readily encouraged
along with the proliferation of public access
terminals, possible operating in the same vein as a
payphone.

OF INTERNET FOR BUSINESS USERS
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Corporate security staff are still concerned over the
use of the Internet for commercial purposes,
according to the third annual Ernst & Young
Information Security Survey.  Over half of the US
firms polled reported security-related financial
losses in the past year with 20 companies reporting
losses in excess of US$1m.  Out of the firms who had
grasped the nettle and gone online, 20% reported that
an intruder had successfully or nearly successfully
breached security systems.  The overall level of
Internet security came under fire from 40% of users
who said they were dissatisfied with the inherent net
security and 87% of firms said that they would make
greater use of the Internet for corporate purposes if
the security was improved. Candidly, most companies
admitted that they do not have adequate tools or
properly trained personnel to defend against
information security losses. The report surveyed
1,300 chief information officers and other senior
information executives. Other interesting findings
included that over 66% of sites encountered a
computer virus in the past year, a rise in the number
of security precautions taken and greater
introduction of security tools. Ernst & Young has
also reported that one out of every five companies
connected to the Internet has reported an attempted
or a successful break-in to their company's network
in the past year and that 65% of firms gave been
affected by a computer virus. A financial loss was
only experienced in a  small portion' of companies
hit by intruders of all kinds. Ernst & Young said
that 66% of its respondents who are not using the
Internet now and 83% of respondents who plan to
within the next year, said they would use the
Internet for more business purposes if security was
enhanced.

exchanging information about child abuse on the net
using the secure codes -- leaving police powerless to
detect and investigate.  Det. Ch. Insp Barry Drew
singled out the PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) package as
the leading cryptographic package which is being used
perfectly innocently by millions of users worldwide
and abused by paedophiles looking at continuing their
sick trade. "Some people are sending porn down the
Internet together with the instructions as to how to
use encryption to safeguard yourself. You need to
know the key to unscramble it. It's being used more
and more extensively for all sorts of things," said
Drew, head of the National Criminal Intelligence
Service paedophile intelligence section, quoted by
PA.

Charter Media Inc has introduced Briefing, said to be
the first intra-day financial market analysis service
available through the Internet which has been
designed for individual investors and money managers,
providing real-time stock, bond and foreign exchange
analysis at no charge. The offering is delivered over
the Internet's WWW and from April 1996 a US$10/month
charge will be levied. Charter Media seems to have a
philanthropic vision. Richard Green, president and
CEO of Charter Media, said: "The Internet allows us
to provide the individual investor with professional
financial analysis that has traditionally cost
hundreds or thousands of dollars per month. We
believe the low cost to access Briefing will help
level the playing field between the individual
investor and professional trader."   Access by
http://www.briefing.com/. Additionally a new online
service has been launched which plans to provide a
range of productivity boosting hints and tips to
network managers.  Lan Software Direct is offering
practical advice on Windows NT, NetWare and Internet
networks and addressing current network management
issues such as network security, Internet access and
NetWare migration.   A number of free and trial
network applications can be downloaded off the site
for subsequent use.  Dan Metcalfe, managing director
of LAN Software Direct claims that network and IT
administrators have been calling for such a service
for a long time even though most of the information
can already be found on the Internet and online
services such as CompuServe. "Network administrators
have been demanding a service like LAN Software
Direct for some time.  Networks are growing in size
and complexity but management resources remain
static.  Administrators need products which will
automatically manage certain elements of the network
and at the same time boost LAN  productivity. Most
managers do not have the time to research and test
the hundreds of software management products on the
market," said Metcalfe.

AlphaNet Telecom Inc of Canada is buoyant about its
expectations of becoming the world's leading provider
of voice and fax Internet services by the end of 1996
through the launch of its Unipost and EconoFax
services.  Much of the confidence comes in the shape
of patents for the technology held in the USA, Canada
and several other key countries. Michael Reichmann,
president of the firm, believes that the Internet
transmission technology patents will make the company
hold a powerful position.  Unipost and EconoFax will
allow users to access and send all their voice, fax
and electronic-mail messages over the Internet for
the cost of a local telephone call, providing
dramatic savings for the users notes the company. A
number of partners will be announced in the near
future in different strategic areas around the world
although further details are presently not known.

-STUDENT CHARGED WITH INTERNET TERRORISM

INTERNET BUSINESS NEWS-STUDENT CHARGED WITH INTERNET
TERRORISM
COPYRIGHT 1994-96 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

A New York state college student has been charged
with terrorizing an Indianapolis family over the
Internet by threatening in e-mail messages to hunt
them down, rape a 12-year-old girl and kill them. The
19-year-old alleged perpetrator has been arrested at
St John's University and charged with aggravated
harassment -- a misdemeanour offence.  It appears
that the activity was viewed as a prank by the
accused.  Court papers reveal that a user under the
alias  Mr Bungle' broke into a conversation that the
12-year-old was having on 21 October on  the Internet
with a 13-year-boy from Toronto and after a few
innocuous questions about age, the accused allegedly
wrote that he wanted to sodomize her. The father of
the young girl intervened online and ordered the
accused to desist, only to receive e-mail littered
with sexually offensive messages which escalated into
threats including claims that he had HIV and would
infect the girl. A hearing has yet to be made.

FREE-WORLD-DIALUP has launched a new service which

This service is slightly different, however, as it
allows the net user to interface to the local public

the incoming Internet phone call and dials a
pre-requested local number on a separate line. For
the trial there are host computers in Jakarta, Tokyo,
New York and London and anyone prepared to pay for

The INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT is concerned about the

apparently unfazed about sex and pornography. Senior
government figures have expressed concern about a
growing conduit of uncensored news on home and
international affairs. Military chiefs are also
attempting to introduce mechanisms to restrict
national access to certain Internet resources
although most observers believe that this task will
prove in reality to be pointless -- pointing to the
experiences of the Chinese government.
