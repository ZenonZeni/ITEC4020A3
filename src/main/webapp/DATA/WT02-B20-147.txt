<b>The CHILD Health Resource Partnership: Collaborative Health Interventions for
Learners
with
Disabilities (CHILD)</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023D40013<br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94<br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97:<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop an integrated, transagency and transdisciplinary
model to
plan, deliver, and research the efficacy of pediatric health care support services to
families and
young children with chronic health care needs and developmental disabilities. <P>

METHOD:  This three-year clinical research project targets children between 4.5 and 6
years
who
are at high risk for cumulative educational and functional disorders because of dual
developmental
disabilities and chronic health conditions.  This project focuses on the late preschool to
early
primary school period as critical to the success of children who must move from early
intervention
programs that emphasize more family-centered and interagency services to less
collaborative,
more professionally-centered school-age services.  Targeted CHILD participants will
have a
variety of mild to severe neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders,
associated active
medical conditions, and mental health disorders.  During the first of two research
phases staff
will
observe, follow, and compare two groups of young children with dual medical and
developmental
needs within the public schools.  The control group will consist of a matched sample of
children
(N=25) who will receive a program plan that they have typically received regarding an
array of
uncoordinated services.  The experimental group will also enroll a matched sample of
children
(N=25) who will receive the CHILD interventions.  After a period of 1 year, Phase 2 will
commence, in which the control group will begin to receive the CHILD interventions. 
Within
and
between group effect size comparisons will be analyzed as well as the progress and
outcome
indicators from using each child and family as its own control. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in the development of a system of
transagency care for children and families with developmental disabilities and medical
and
mental
health needs, a family-centered model of decision making about child needs that relies
on
parental
participation and co-leadership, and establishment of collaborative transagency
strategies for
teamwork that foster agency and policy changes.     <P>

<b>Children with Disabilities as a Part of the Systemic Efforts to Restructure Schools
</b><br> 

GRANT NUMBER: H023R20010<br> 
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/93<br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/96<P>                                 

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will restructure secondary programs at Holt High School in
order to
provide improved student advocacy for students with disabilities and those designated
as "high
risk". <P>

METHOD:  Interactive relationships will be developed with established school
programs, child
and adult service agencies, and the Holt community.  Parent and student support
groups will be
established, and training in postsecondary rights and service delivery systems will be
provided
for
students and parents.  A core transdisciplinary staff will be established with the ability to
identify
needs and assist with making contacts with identified agencies.  Specific services
provided to
students will include mentorship, vocational assessment, career counseling,
psychosocial
counseling, training in assertiveness and self-advocacy, and other services as identified
imperative
to transition into adult life. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  An estimated 250 students will be served directly through
the
project, and an additional 300 will receive indirect services.  The ultimate outcome for
the
students will be active participation in achieving personal, educational, and vocational
skills
development, utilizing school and community support, to result in appropriate
employment,
independence, and involvement with the community.  A comprehensive evaluation plan,
including
formative and summative evaluation methods, will provide and disseminate data on the
effectiveness, and efficiency of project efforts.<P>

<b>Systemic Restructuring to Include Children with  Disabilities: A School-based
Multi-District 
   
Demonstration Program</b><br>  

GRANT NUMBER: H023R20030 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>
ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will determine what common systemic changes need to be
made in
schools that are restructuring to increase the inclusion of students with disabilities in
general
education and improve outcomes for all students. <P>

METHOD:  An initial model of necessary systemic changes will be developed that will
achieve
the
above goals regardless of the sociodemographic characteristics of a school, its stage of
restructuring, or the innovative practices adopted by the school. This model will be
developed
through determination of common systemic changes specified in strategic plans
developed at the
end of the first year of the project by all five participating schools.  The model will be
demonstrated through implementation of changes selected by participating schools as
being
critical to implement selected innovative practices.  Through case studies the
implementation
process will be evaluated, and case study results will guide the process of revision and
refinement
throughout the project. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A newsletter will be developed that describes project
findings
and
status of the demonstration.  Presentations will be made at national, regional, and state
conferences.  Project staff will meet with the principal investigators of the other six
funded
demonstration grants to share findings and shape further dissemination plans.<P>

BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/92<br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will employ a systematic perspective in pursuit of an ambitious
agenda
of working at the state, district, and school levels to evaluate and revise policies and
practices
and
encourage full participation and collaboration among members of the Metro-Nashville
public
school system and the community at large.<P>                              

 METHOD:  Quantitative and qualitative methods will be employed within a
quasi-experimental
design using two project schools and one comparison school.  After spending the first
half of the
first year in planning, School A will conduct small pilots of systematic changes and
effective
practices, with School B being studied for comparison and control purposes. 
Implementation at
School A will gradually increase throughout the second year until at least 70% of the
school
population participates in project activities.  Meanwhile School C will commence
planning and
piloting much as School A did in the previous year.  Individual goals within this
framework will
range from detracking and curriculum enrichment to university and hospital linkages
and reform
of decision-making and self-determination processes throughout the system.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Following documentation and validation of project
practices,
dissemination to the scholarly audience will focus on ERIC network reports, journal
articles, and
presentations at national, state and regional conferences.  Parents and practitioners will
be

<b>Synthesis and Dissemination of a Knowledge Base Regarding Outcomes from the
Placement
of
Students with Disabilities in General Education Classrooms</b><br>  

GRANT NUMBER: H023E40005 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94<br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>                                 

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to provide practitioners with easier access to
relevant
information and to provide answers on how to appropriately educate students with
disabilities in
the least restrictive environment (LRE).  The project will synthesize, communicate, and
foster the
use of the knowledge base concerning the placement of students with disabilities in the
general
education classroom, and the outcomes of different general classroom support models
for
students with different disabilities.<P>  

METHOD:  Staff will use a grounded theory approach, integrating multiple data sources
and
generating themes, patterns, and constructs inductively.  The synthesis will focus on
the key
variables of students' characteristics, program characteristics, setting and context, and
intended
and actual outcomes.  A series of coding matrices will be developed and combined to
describe
the
data set and to study the factors affecting student outcomes.  Staff will initiate the
knowledge
base synthesis by creating an easily accessible database through which practitioners
and
researchers can find useful information about the outcomes of the placement of
students with
specific disabilities in specific teacher/learning environments.  Staff members will then
review
and
index the usable knowledge of outcomes according to disability, types of outcomes,
program
characteristics, and developmental and grade level.  Next, staff will prepare at least two
different
information packets synthesizing portions of the database.  Selection of topics will be
based on
the
number of the documents in the database and the perceived needs of those in the field. 
This
database will be disseminated and supported through the inclusion of stakeholders
throughout the
process, a forum to be held in Washington, DC in cooperation with OSEP, and a
dissemination
strategy including the use of electronic networks.  Finally, staff will provide an analysis
that will
compare strengths and weaknesses of different inclusion models for different types of
students.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Products will include a bibliography; collected knowledge
of
outcomes indexed by disability, types of outcomes, program characteristics, and
school-level; a
user-friendly database with a manual that will enable users to access the database and
manipulate
it for their own needs; and two information packets synthesizing selected portions of the
database. <P>

<b>School-Linked Services to Support Better Outcomes for  Children with Disabilities
and Their
Families</b><br>  

GRANT NUMBER: H023D40015 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/94<br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96<P>                                 

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct research examining school-linked services for
children
with
disabilities and their families based on a conceptual framework that views system
issues, service
issues, and child and family outcomes as important areas for study.<P>  

METHOD:  Project staff will undertake two components of research: a multisite analysis
of
systems, services and outcomes, and an in-depth look at the delivery of services in a
school-linked
model in one community.  The multisite component will examine the services and
outcomes for
students in special education across 65 Healthy Start school-linked sites in California. 
Under the
multisite component, staff will analyze data collected for a concurrent Healthy Start
evaluation to
compare services and outcomes for students in special education with those for other
service
recipients.  To provide a richer look at special education in a school-linked services
model, staff
will study school-linked services for students with disabilities at a single Healthy Start
site.  The
design for this component includes both qualititative and quantitative techniques. Data
collection
techniques will include staff interviews, direct observations, document analysis, reviews
of client
and student records, family interviews, and family case studies.  Service and outcome
data for
students with disabilities and their families will be compared with those for others in the
same
school and with students in special and regular education in a comparison school that
serves a
similar population but does not provide school-linked services.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This study will provide a detailed description of a
school-linked
services model from the policy perspective, service-provider perspective, and family
perspective. 
Data from the qualitative components will be used to describe how school-linked
services
models
bring about improved child and family outcomes.<P>

<b>Evaluating School-linked Services for Children with Disabilities and Their Families
</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023D40017 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94<br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:      This project will describe the participation and outcomes of students with
disabilities and their families who receive school-linked services in schools that are
implementing
the full-service school concept, and to study programmatic and policy implications
associated
with
the delivery of school-linked services using a full-service school concept.<P>  

METHOD:  Staff will conduct three interrelated studies to address: (1) the
implementation of
this
concept of delivery; (2) whether services provided are culturally competent and based
on family
needs rather than service providers' perspectives; and (3) academic and social
outcomes of
participating students with disabilities.  The research will be conducted in two
elementary
schools
selected by the district because of their substantial need for general health, mental
health, and
social services.  Study 1 will conduct case studies with the schools as the unit of
analysis to
provide an in-depth profile of the full-service concept, describe the participation of
children and
families, and identify systemic and programmatic features that act as barriers to, or
facilitators of
participation.  Study 2 will compare the extent of participation and the outcomes of
students with
disabilities who attend full-service schools with: (1) students without disabilities in the
same
schools; and (2) students with disabilities who receive continual special education and
related
services in representative schools in the district.  During this study, staff will also assess
and
analyze students' outcomes using the National Center for Educational Outcomes
model. Finally,
Study 3 will involve an analysis of 12 individual case studies of students with disabilities
and
their
families that focuses on the quality of services and whether this quality varies with type
of
disability and race and ethnicity.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in an in-depth profile of the
full-service
school concept, an in-depth description of full-service school concept implementation,
an
analysis
of the academic and social outcomes for students with disabilities, and data regarding
programmatic and policy  implications of the full-service school concept.<P>

BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/93<br>
ENDING DATE:  5/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop, implement and evaluate district-wide policies and
procedures to change the overall educational system in a manner that includes
students with
disabilities as a major component of this reform.<P>  

METHOD:  The Model Project will be implemented in a school district in Rotterdam,
New
York,
which currently serves 2,900 students, including 215 special education students.  The
project will
employ a district steering committee, a model project think tank, six district planning
teams,
three
building reform teams, and four participant/observers as basic structures of operation. 
During
the
initial planning phase, district planning teams will engage in refining major goals,
determining
specific outcomes associated with each goal, and developing measurement techniques
to assess
each specific outcome.  Building-level planning will follow, using school-based teams to
set
standards for determining goal attainment at each school, and to formulate reform
intervention
plans and professional development activities designed to accomplish these reforms. 
Building
reform teams will design strategies and structure implementation activities in their own
schools,
and along with the steering committee they will monitor the efficacy of
implementation.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project staff will present findings and results of this
project at
state and local conferences.  They will also provide inservice training and develop

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will study school-linked services that are designed to support
better
outcomes for children with disabilities and their families through the combined efforts of
the
Kansas State Board of Education (KSBE) and two local school districts providing
school-linked
services.<P>  

METHOD:  The sample for this investigation will include all children (N=270) and their
families
who receive school-linked services through one of the two target projects.  This
research project
consists of interactive qualitative and quantitative components designed to augment
each other. 
For the  qualitative component, staff will conduct naturalistic inquiries regarding policy
and
implementation issues related to school-linked services. These naturalistic inquiries will
reveal
the
perspectives of participants at all levels of the implementation process, including
consumers,
teachers, administrators, related service providers, and other stakeholders. During the
first project
year, the inquiry team will identify service integration needs and barriers at each site
and develop
potential solutions relative to matters such as logistics of services and staff training
needs. 
During
the second project year, policy, planning, and implementation recommendations will be
enacted
and the inquiry will serve as a formative evaluation of their impact.  Using both
consumer and
participant perspectives, inquiry teams will examine both accessibility and outcomes of
these
services.  The third project year will involve development and refinement of case
studies
detailing
the impact of planning and implementation processes carried out during the first two
years.
Quantitative descriptive research techniques will be used primarily to examine the
impact of
school-linked services integration in terms of accessibility of services and outcomes of
services.
Investigations will be prioritized by relevant stakeholders through Advisory Council
participation
and naturalistic inquiry information. Areas of study will include length of time between
problem
identification and implementation of services, and demographic information.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in identification of effective
processes for
the initial development and implementation of school-linked services, identification of
barriers to
school-linked service implementation, and a description of the impact of school-linked
services
on
children with disabilities and their families.<P>

<b>Including Children with Disabilities in School-Based Change</b><br>  

GRANT NUMBER: H023R30014 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93<br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P> 

PURPOSE:  The project will  implement and evaluate a school-based change process
to help
schools take a comprehensive view of special education services and the needs of the
children
they serve.<P>  

METHOD:  The model to be employed includes the following components: (1)
school-wide self
examination; (2) parental involvement; (3) a school-based planning team; (4) ongoing
and varied
forms of technical assistance; (5) time-limited funds to the school for innovation; and (6)
planned
exit of the researchers.  Within the model, school staff and parents articulate guiding
principles
for
the design of effective services for children with disabilities, and then participate in a
four-day
workshop to examine school practices in relation to these guiding principles and the
school's
stated goals.  Two schools that are engaged in school-based restructuring will serve as
test sites. 
Qualitative case study methodology, quantitative measures, and data produced by the
built-in
evaluation process will be used to provide evidence of the change model's
effectiveness in
producing meaningful outcomes for special education students.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings and results from this project will be
presented
at annual meetings of professional organizations and published in relevant journals. 
Specific
project products anticipated will include a practitioner guide on considerations in making
schools
more effective for children with disabilities, and a description of special education
services
within
site-managed schools. <P>

and their Families</b><br>  

GRANT NUMBER: H159A40013 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94<br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P> 

PURPOSE:  The project will examine the impact of school restructuring efforts in South
Dakota
upon students with disabilities.  The study will also seek to determine the level of
involvement of
special education personnel and students with disabilities and their families in school
modernization efforts.  In addition, the project will assess the impact of school
modernization
efforts on the performance of students with disabilities.<P>  

METHOD:  Questions on the impact of restructuring efforts will be answered through
collection
of data from state agencies and the 20 school districts currently participating in the
modernization
project.  Three school districts (one each in the first, second and third years of the
project) will
provide in-depth qualitative data for analysis of local and classroom-level changes that
impact
special education programs and students.  Quantitative data will be collected from
participating
school districts, calling for information from administrators, support staff and teachers
who use
the Portland Instrument and the About Your District Questionnaire.  Students'
performance
indicator data will be gathered from schools via the Student Information System and
direct
examination of a stratified random selection of students' IEPs.<P> 

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  At the local district level, findings of the study will be
presented
to all participating school districts, and will be disseminated on request to other South
Dakota
school districts through the state agency and Modernization Project.  At the state level,
findings
will be disseminated through presentations at state-wide conferences and through print
media
disseminated through state agencies and organizations.  At the national level,
dissemination
activities will include reports to the Department of Education, presentations, and
publication of
monographs through national organizations.<P>

ABSTRACT<P> 

PURPOSE:  This project will demonstrate that systemic school reform is possible, that
its effects
can be documented, and that methods used to initiate systemic reform can be
disseminated to
other schools.<P>  

METHOD:  Over a two year period, stakeholders and project staff will develop and test
a more
tangible and transportable version of the basic model of school restructuring in
question.  Project
staff will assist stakeholders as they develop materials and design training programs for
a
second-generation target school to join the project in a third year.  Materials will show
how a
traditional school can move through shared decision-making on to curricular,
instructional and
organizational restructuring. Specific programs to meet the academic, social, and
developmental
needs of at-risk children will be offered.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination of project findings will be carried out
through
conference presentations, articles for publication, distribution via the ERIC database,
and a
manual on meeting the needs of hard-to-reach students in restructured schools.<P>

<b>Project Succeed in  Middle Schools: Securing Understanding in Content Through
Consultation
and Explicit Environmental Demands</b>  <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30064 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93<br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop, field-test, and evaluate a special education
service
delivery
model for middle schools, with content teachers as the primary source of
instruction.<P>  

METHOD:  In Year One, the project will focus on providing content teachers a structure
for
organizing their content-teaching.  During Year Two, the study will investigate effects of
systematic databased feedback on teachers' use of this structural framework.  In Year
Three,
attention will shift to examine how teachers manipulate the two dimensions of the
framework in
their curriculum and within their interactive instruction to achieve changes in student
perception
and learning.  In the fourth project year, the special educator will be added as case
consultant
within this package with a student progress monitoring system.  The teacher will also be
placed
in
the role of researcher to identify individually effective strategies within a component
analysis,
using individual student monitoring of learning outcomes and explicit consultation
support
systems.  Finally, in Year Five, the manipulation of Organized Knowledge Forms and
Interactive
Learning Tasks will be synthesized in a consultation system and evaluated.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities will include the following:
presentation
at
national conferences during all 5 years of the project; presentations at preconference
workshops;
publication of a number of research reports, monographs, and training modules; and
teaching
both
methodology and findings from research in courses on-campus.<P>

GRANT NUMBER: H023R30026 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93<br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE: This project will attempt to implement and explain the relationships among
interdependent systemic processes and resource use strategies within the context of
school
reform/restructuring to enhance system  adaptability and inclusiveness as means for
achieving
better educational outcomes for children with disabilities.<P>  

METHOD:  Three important resource use strategies with extensive empirical support
and
widespread application will be explored; including: team-building from within the context
of
organization development framework; consultation as practiced from a broad behavioral
approach; and curriculum-based assessment.  Particular objectives to be sought among
participating children will include presence and participation in school programs,
independence
and personal responsibility, skilled social behaviors, and improved literacy.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide systemic design features for
assuring
that primary school restructuring initiatives meet the needs of children with disabilities. 
The use
of rigorous case study replications will both guide these efforts and provide valid design
principles
for schools initiating primary education reform and restructuring initiatives. <P>

<b>The Quality Management and Practices Project (QMAP) </b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023R20019 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92<br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and implement a process for adapting and
internalizing
effective assessment and instructional practices for students with disabilities that will
inform the
ongoing broader school-based restructuring efforts in the four-school Powerful Schools
Coalition
(PSC). <P> 

METHOD:  An organizational context will be developed to stimulate ongoing
implementation of
school innovation for students with disabilities.  The PSC will develop a  plan for
systemic
change
to incorporate effective practices for students with disabilities in PSC restructuring
efforts. 
Effective practices for students with disabilities will be designed, introduced, evaluated,
refined,
and incorporated in field-test classrooms within participating schools.  Validated
practices will
then be selected for implementation throughout the PSC.  Case studies will be
conducted on the
policy, organization, administrative, opera- tional and cultural features that enable
schools to
implement systemic changes.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will identify the mediating and bridging
conditions
that link effective teaching and learning practices with structural alterations that sustain
positive
student and teacher outcomes.  The case studies will be a major product of the project,
as they
will describe components of the system and the culture of the schools that the schools 
choose to
focus on as they incorporate these practices into the process of continuous
improvement.<P>

BEGINNING DATE: 9/01/93<br>
ENDING DATE: 8/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>
PURPOSE:  This project plans to initiate and sustain systemic school change that
supports the
inclusion of students with disability labels in general education classrooms and in their
communities.<P>  

METHOD:  Through the process, members of the Alice Smith School community will
collaboratively gather information about the systemic and organizational features of
their school
and community, describe goals and visions for both the school and for student
outcomes, identify
critical features that impact the full adoption of new ideas and best practices, and
implement
strategic action plans to restructure the system so that full inclusion and educational
excellence
are achieved.  Intensive, ongoing evaluation will be used to assess and refine the
restructuring
model to develop a systematic yet flexible model that will be replicated in a second
school in the
third and fourth years of the project.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project is expected to significantly contribute to
knowledge
about systemic features of schools that impact adoption of inclusive education best
practices, and
of planned educational restructuring.  Dissemination of project results and findings will
be
achieved through a combination of conference presentations, journal articles, and
replication
efforts.<P>

<b>Restructuring Education for all Learners</b><br>  

GRANT NUMBER: H023R20005 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/93<br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to incorporate effective practices for
individuals with
disabilities into broader school-based educational reform and restructuring initiatives
occurring
in
two elementary schools in Dade County.<P>  

METHOD:  The program will begin with a community-building and planning phase,
followed by
an intensive university/school partnership phase focusing on faculty development,
strengthening
resources for the school, and implementing innovative service delivery for persons with
disabilities.  University support for the restructuring effort will gradually give way to
site-based
implementation.  Tutoring services will be provided with the assistance of the University
of
Miami
Student Literacy Corps.  School site, teacher, and student case studies will be
conducted for both
process and outcome evaluation and data analysis.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings from this study will be reported through six major
channels: Strategically Planned Dissemination Networks, journal articles, conference
presentations, computer networks, curriculum  diissemination, and community-based
discussion/meeting groups.  National restructuring networks will participate in ensuring
availability of findings to all school districts currently involved in school restructuring. 
The
project is believed to have the potential to produce collaborative change in the
restructuring of
education for all learners at local, state and national levels.<P>
