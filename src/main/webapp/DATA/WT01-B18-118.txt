<H2>The Future of Primary Care: Proceedings of a Conference, edited by Jane Griffin</H2>
<HR>

This stimulating OHE book, edited by Jane Griffin, reports a series of papers presented at a conference in October 1995 on the future of general practice. Its purpose was not only to try to explain this fascinating paradox between political influence and job satisfaction, but to look to the future. We are about to witness a watershed in the history of primary health care in the UK and perhaps elsewhere. The pressures on a socialist health care system from consumer expectation and public spending constraint are not reversible.
There is no way back to the country practice of Dr Finlay. General practice has been elevated to centre stage to deal with these
pressures, and if it is to survive, it must move forward and seize its opportunity.
<P>
The contributors to the conference were from overseas as well as from the UK. They were asked to give their view on the way
forward for general practice from an international perspective. They dealt with an impressive range of issues from comparison
of the effect of primary care on the performance of national health care systems to the importance of continuity of care to the individual
patient. They presented an impressive array of information on the organisation and funding of primary care systems in Europe
and North America.
<P>
In the book Professor Starfield discusses the characteristics of a strong primary care system, which, she argues, are accessibility,
continuity of care, comprehensiveness, and coordination. Dr Makela, Professor van der Zee and Professor Light look at the systems
which have arisen in Finland, the Netherlands and the United States, respectively. Other important issues addressed are the future
of fundholding by Professor Ham and the causes of and solutions to low GP morale, by Professor Mant and Mr Towse. In the final
chapter, Professor Roland sets out his vision as to how the dangers of fragmentation and the challenges to define and assure quality
of care can be met.
