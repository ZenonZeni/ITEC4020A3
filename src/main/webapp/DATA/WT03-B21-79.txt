<P>
Even in a bull market it is prudent to watch for problem stocks.
All stocks simply do not advance in unison. And individual companies
can run into problems anytime.
<P>
Many investors like to use stops just below recent resistance
levels as a basis for &quot;locking-in&quot; profits. We think
this is a mistake. For example, if we had used stops we would
have been taken out of some of our best Model Portfolio stocks
at lower levels. In general we much prefer to wait until the stock's
momentum has stalled out and turned down before selling. This
technique allows us to build up far greater long-term profits.
<P>
The stock of Winnebago is an example of a well-known stock that
was flying high until the end of 1983. At that time the stock's
fundamentals were excellent. Earnings were accelerating and the
stock price was consistently hitting new highs. No one seemed
to perceive the approaching difficulties about to swamp the company...rising
interest rates, rising gas prices, huge inventories. The RP (relative
performance) correction began at the beginning of the second quarter
of  '83. There was a bounce in August, but by October it was evident
the momentum had turned down and our RP line gave a clear sell
signal. It was a full year before the first devastating quarterly
report of poor earnings. The RP line was sagging under the weight
of insider selling. There were brief rallies in the stock's momentum
(one in 1985 and one in 1986) but the downslide continued through
1990.
<P>
The RP line, which tells us when an individual stock should be
sold, usually behaves in one of two ways. Either there is a severe
sell-off followed by a weak bounce (as in the case of Winnebago)
or the RP line tends to stall out month after month, eventually
slumping to new lows. Usually the business news concerning these
stocks is favorable. Earnings may even still be climbing. But
behind all of this pleasant news the stock is slowly being distributed
to unknowing investors. These new buyers are not aware of what
the insiders know, and so they believe the sell-off is only a
temporary correction. BUT WHEN THE RP CORRECTION PERSISTS FOR
MORE THAN THIRTEEN WEEKS, BE CAREFUL!
<P>
In a stock where you have a substantial profit, you might let the RP correction 
run to 20 or more weeks. But the longer the correction the higher the odds 
that the stock is losing its positive momentum. Sell and take your profit when 
this happens. In a stock where you have little or no profit, you should sell 
quickly if a 13-week RP correction takes place. If you are developing a loss, 
never let it grow to more than 15% or 20% of your original purchase price.
