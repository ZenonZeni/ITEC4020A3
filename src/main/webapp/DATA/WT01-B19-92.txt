Dear Mr. Olsen:
     Thank you for your letter of March 24, 1996 and the enclosed 
materials regarding proposals to permit certain individuals to use 
marijuana.  I am glad that you  took the time to share those concerns with 
me. 
     Recent medical evidence indicates that routine use of marijuana has
significant harmful side effects.  Accordingly, I do not support efforts 
to legalize marijuana.  At this time, there are prescription drugs on the
market to induce some of the effects attributed to marijuana, including 
the appetite loss experienced by chemotherapy patients and others.
     Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts with me. 
     Sincerely,
     Greg Ganske, M.D.
     Member of Congress
