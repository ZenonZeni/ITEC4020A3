<H1>October - Tips For Each Day</h1>
<P><STRONG>Monday, October 2</STRONG> 
<P>Tips for efficient use of heating and cooling systems:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>During Both Heating and Cooling Seasons, clean or replace furnace and air conditioner filters regularly.  
<LI>Keep outside units free from leaves or debris that may clog vents.  
<LI>Close off unoccupied rooms and shut their heat or air-conditioning vents; or turn off  room air conditioners.  (This does not apply if you have a heat pump system, since shutting vents could harm a heat pump).  
<LI>Use kitchen, bath and other ventilating fans wisely.  In just one hour, these fans can blow away a house full of warmed or cooled air.  Turn them off just as soon as they have done their job.
</UL>
<TITLE>October 3 Tip of the Day </TITLE>
<P><STRONG>Tuesday, October 3</STRONG>
<P>Tips on buying and maintaining heating systems:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Keep your heating equipment well-tuned with periodic maintenance by a professional serviceman.  Ask the serviceman how the energy efficiency of the heating system can be increased.  
<LI>If you plan to buy a new furnace, select an energy-efficient unit.  Your contractor has energy factsheets for each model; ask for them and compare energy usage.  
<LI>Consider the advantages of a clock thermostat for your heating system.  The clock thermostat will turn the heat down for you automatically when you depart or go to bed and turn it up again when you return or awaken.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Wednesday, October 4</STRONG>
<P>Tips on using your fireplace efficiently:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>When you use your fireplace, close all doors and warm air ducts entering the room containing the fireplace, and open a window near the fireplace about 1/2 to 1 inch.  Combustion air needed by the fire will be provided through the open window, and the amount of heated air drawn from the rest of the house will be reduced.  
<LI>If you have a simple open masonry fireplace, consider installing a glass screen, a convective grate, a combination convective grate with glass screen, a radiant grate, or a fireplace insert.  Some of these devices will cut down on the loss of warm air through the fireplace chimney.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Thursday, October 5</STRONG>
<P>Tips for efficient furnace usage:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>When the heat is on,  lower your thermostat to about 65 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and 60 degrees F at night.  You can save on your fuel costs for every degree you reduce the average temperature in your home.  
<LI>Keep windows near your thermostat tightly closed.  Unnecessary drafts will keep your furnace working after the rest of the room has reached a comfortable temperature.  
<LI>Check the duct work for air leaks about once a year if you have a forced-air heating system.  To do this, feel around the duct joints for escaping air when the fan is on.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Friday, October 6</STRONG>
<P>Tips on using your air conditioning system:  
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Keep your cooling system well-tuned with periodic maintenance by a professional serviceman.  Ask the serviceman how the energy efficiency of the system can be increased.
<LI>If you need central air conditioning, select a unit with the lowest suitable capacity and highest efficiency.  
<LI>A larger unit than you need not only costs more to buy and run, but probably won't remove enough moisture from the air.  
<LI>Plant trees and shrubs to shade air-conditioning units.  You can increase efficiency by up to 10 percent.  
<LI>Install an attic ventilation fan to cool the house when it's cool outside, even if you have central air conditioning.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Monday, October 9</STRONG>
<P>Tips for using your kitchen sink:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Use cold water rather than hot to operate your food disposer.  This saves the energy needed to heat the water, is recommended for the appliance, and aids in getting rid of grease.  Grease solidifies in cold water and is then easier to grind up and wash away.  
<LI>Install an aerator in your kitchen sink faucet.  By reducing the amount of water in the flow, you use less hot water and save the energy that would have been required to heat it.  
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Tuesday, October 10</STRONG>
<P>Efficient energy tips for your dishwasher:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>When using your dishwasher, let your dishes air dry.  If you don't have an automatic air-dry switch, turn off the control knob after the final rinse.  Prop the door open a little and the dishes will dry faster.  
<LI>Don't use the "rinse hold" on your machine for just a few dishes.  It uses 3 to 7 gallons of hot water each time you use it.  
<LI>Be sure that your dishwasher is full, but not overloaded, when you turn it on.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Wednesday, October 11</STRONG>
<P>Refrigerator/Freezer energy savers:  
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Don't keep your refrigerator or freezer too cold. Recommended temperatures:  38 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit for the fresh food compartment of the refrigerator; 5 degrees F for the freezer section.  Regularly defrost manual-defrost refrigerators and freezers.  Frost buildup increases the amount of energy needed to keep the engine running.  Never allow frost to build up more than one-quarter of an inch.  
<LI>Make sure your refrigerator door seals airtight.  Test them by closing the door over a piece of paper or dollar bill so it is half in and half out of the refrigerator.  If you can pull the paper out easily, the latch may need adjustment or the seal may need replacing.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Thursday, October 12</STRONG>
<P>Washer and Dryer Energy Tips:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>When using your washing machine, don't use too much detergent.  Follow the instructions on the box.  Oversudsing makes your machine work harder and use more energy.  
<LI>Presoak or use a soak cycle when washing heavily soiled garments.  You'll avoid two washings and save energy.  
<LI>Keep the lint screen in the dryer clean.  Remove lint after each load.  Lint impedes the flow of air in the dryer, which makes your clothes take longer to dry and requires the machine to use more energy.  
<LI>Keep the outside exhaust of  your clothes dryer clean.  Check it regularly.  A clogged exhaust lengthens the drying time and increases the amount of energy used.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Friday, October 13</STRONG>
<P>Energy saving tips for your shower:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Take showers rather than baths, but limit your showering time and check the water flow if you want to save energy.  It takes bout 30 gallons of water to fill the average tub.  A shower with a flow of 3 gallons of water a minute uses only 15 gallons in 5 minutes.  
<LI>Consider installing a flow controller at the showerhead.  These inexpensive, easy-to-install devices restrict the flow of water to an adequate 3 to 4 gallons per minute.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Monday, October 16</STRONG>
<P>Tips for maintaining efficient light fixtures:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>To reduce overall lighting in non-working spaces, remove one bulb out of three in multiple light fixtures and replace it with a burned-out bulb for safety.  
<LI>Replace other bulbs throughout the house with bulbs of the next lower wattage. 
<LI>Consider installing solid-state dimmers or high-low switches when replacing light switches. They make it easy to reduce lighting intensity in a room and thus save energy.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Tuesday, October 17</STRONG>
<P>Using fluorescent bulbs:	
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Use compact fluorescent lights whenever your can; they give out more lumens per watt than incandescent lamps.  These new lights can fit into many incandescent lamp sockets and provide the same quality of light.  
<LI>With efficiencies of 50-60 lumens per watt, the compact fluorescent lamps are 3-4 times more efficient than conventional bulbs and last 10 times as long.  For example, an 18-watt compact fluorescent lamp produces the same amount of light as a 75-watt incandescent lamp.  Although the initial cost is higher, the savings in electricity costs could pay for the compact fluorescent bulb in about a year.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Wednesday, October 18</STRONG>
<P>Tips for purchasing lighting appliances:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Consider the advantages of purchasing lights with three-way switches.  They make it easy to keep lighting levels low when intense light is not necessary.  Use the high switch only for reading or other activities that require brighter light.
<LI>Try 25-watt reflector flood bulbs in high-intensity portable lamps.  They provide about the same amount of light but use less energy than the 40-watt bulbs that normally come with these lamps.
<LI>Try 50-watt reflector floodlights in directional lamps.  These floodlights provide about the same amount of light as the standard 100-watt bulbs, but at half the wattage.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Thursday, October 19</STRONG>
<P>About decorative gas lamps:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Have them turned off, unless they are essential for safety.  Just eight gas lamps burning year round use as much natural gas as it takes to heat an average-size home for a winter season.  By turning off one gas lamp, you might save from $40 to $50 a year in natural gas costs.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Friday, October 20</STRONG>
<P>Outdoor lighting tips:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Use outdoor lights only when they are needed.  One way to make sure they're off during the daylight hours is to put them on a photocell unit or timer that will turn them off automatically.  
<LI>Consider installing solar-powered outdoor pathway lamps or high-efficiency sodium lamps for outdoor security lighting.  They are available at many local hardware stores and building suppliers.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Monday, October 23</STRONG>
<P>Insulating Tips
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Insulate walls and roof to the highest specifications recommended for your area.  Insulate floors too, especially those over crawl spaces, cold basements and garages.  
<LI>If the base of the house is exposed, as in the case of a mobile home, build a "skirt" around it.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Tuesday, October 24</STRONG>
<P>Window efficiency tips:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Use double-pane insulating glass throughout the house.  
<LI>Consider windows with low-emissivity (low-E) coatings and gas fills when retrofit or replacement is necessary.  They also improve comfort, cut condensation, and reduce the fading effect of ultraviolet light on home furnishings.  Installing low-E coated double glass unit with gas fill, instead of standard double glazing, will improve the insulating value of the glass area by 40 to 50 percent.
</UL>


<P><STRONG>Wednesday, October 25</STRONG>
<P>Tips on appliance placement:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Place your refrigerator in the coolest part of the kitchen, well away from the range and oven.  
<LI>Install the water heater as close as possible to areas of major use to minimize heat loss through the pipes.  Insulate the pipes.
</UL>


<P><STRONG>Thursday, October 26</STRONG>
<P>When buying a home:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Ask for a description of the insulation and data on the efficiency of space heating, air-conditioning, and water heating plants, or have an independent engineer advise you about the efficiency of the equipment.  
<LI>Ask to see the utility bills from the previous year, but remember to adjust them for current utility rates.  You may want to compare the bills of houses under construction.

</UL>

<P><STRONG>Friday, October 27</STRONG>
<P>Tips on upgrading or retrofitting an existing home:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Consider the need for additional insulation or replacement of equipment.  Even some new houses don't have insulation in the exterior walls; be sure to check.
<LI>If improvements are necessary, you may want to seek an adjustment in the purchase price to cover all, or a reasonable share, of the costs. 
<LI>When making major upgrades to improve the energy efficiency of an existing home, ask your lender for information about "Energy Efficient Mortgages" or other special financial incentives.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Monday, October 30</STRONG>
<P>Commuting:
<ul>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Use public transportation whenever possible.  One person commuting to work by mass transit instead of driving can save 200 gallons of gasoline in a year.
<LI>Use the most fuel-efficient motorcycle, moped, or even a bicycle for short commutes.  <LI>If you live close enough, try walking to work.
<LI>Join a carpool or a vanpool.  About one-third of all private automobile mileage is for commuting to work.  
<LI>If occupancy increased by just one person per car, more than 40 million gallons of gasoline would be saved each day.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Tuesday, October 31</STRONG>
<P>General Driving Tips:
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Observe posted speed limits.  The average car uses 17 percent less gasoline at 55 mph than at 65 mph.  If highway speed limits were observed across the country, approximately 4 million gallons of gasoline would be saved each day.
<LI>Avoid stop-and-go traffic.  Check the traffic well ahead of you to avoid wasteful accelerations and decelerations.  Take your foot off the accelerator as soon as you see a red light or slowed traffic ahead.
<LI>Accelerate smoothly and moderately.  Reach your desired speed, and then keep just enough pressure on the accelerator to maintain steady speed.  On the highway, cruise control can help you do this.
