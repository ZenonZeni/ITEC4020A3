<H1>Government's CO<SUB>2</SUB> target for 2010 likely to be met, but new
measures needed for more stringent Labour target</H1></CENTER>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics today publishes its latest edition of <I>UK Energy
and the Environment</I>, containing detailed forecasts of energy demand and CO<SUB>2</SUB>
and SO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions by fuel user and fuel type to the year 2005. 
These forecasts are based on MDM, Cambridge Econometrics' integrated
energy-environment-economy model of the UK.</P>
<P>The Government has confirmed a target of 5-10% reductions in UK emissions
below 1990 levels by 2010, in John Gummer's speech at the Geneva Climate Change
conference on 17 July.  The latest CE forecast of UK carbon emissions suggests
that in 2000 they will be around 8% below the 1990 level, and will rise only
slightly by 2005.  The main factors contributing to lower emissions over this
period are the electricity industry's shift from coal-fired generation to
gas-fired generation, and the impact of the road fuel duty escalator on road
transport fuel demand (which we assume will be continued indefinitely).</P>
<P>What happens to the pattern of carbon emissions after 2005 remains
uncertain, and will depend to a large extent on whether it remains economic for
the electricity industry to continue switching into gas, and on whether the
government maintains the road fuel duty escalator at 5pp above the rate of
inflation.</P>
<P>The Labour Party's CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions target for 2010 is tougher than
the Government's: it seeks a reduction of 20% below 1990 levels (as stated in
<I>Trust for Tomorrow</I>, the 1994 report of the Labour Party's Policy
Commission on the environment, and confirmed by Tony Blair in February in his
speech to the Royal Society).  The CE forecast suggests that new measures would
be required to achieve such a target, and the Labour Party has itself proposed
introducing further energy-saving schemes and voluntary agreements with
industry.</P>
<P>The Liberal Democrats have for several years supported a 30% reduction in
carbon emissions over 15 years, which would certainly require more stringent
measures.  One means by which more substantial reductions in CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions might be achieved is via eco-tax reform:  a shift in the tax structure
from taxing so-called `goods', such as employment, to taxing `bads', such as
pollution arising out of energy use.  The report includes a detailed discussion
of the use of market-based instruments such as environmental taxes and charges
as a way of achieving environmental targets, compared with the more traditional
regulatory approach.</P>
<H2>Forecast Trends in Energy Demand and Other Environmental Emissions</H2>
<P>After a decline in total final energy consumption of 0.8% in 1995 total
energy demand is forecast to increase over the next few years before flattening
out and then falling slightly by the end of the forecast period.  Over the same
time GDP is forecast to grow steadily and be nearly 30% higher in real terms
than the 1995 level by the year 2005.</P>
<P>One of the most important fuel users in terms of primary fuel inputs and
environmental emissions is power generation.  The latest data show that total
electricity generation increased by 1.9% in 1995.  Inputs of gas to power
generation rose by over 25% in 1995 while the demand for coal fell by 4.4%. 
Coal is still responsible for over 45% of the primary fuel inputs to the ESI,
with nuclear nearly 30% and natural gas over 15%.  Gas is expected to overtake
coal as the most important primary fuel input to electricity before 2000.</P>
<P>Key trends in demand by other fuel users are as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Demand for energy by industry is forecast to increase slowly until the end
of the decade and then fall, during which time gas demand is expected to
increase at the expense of coal and oil.</LI>
<LI>Overall demand for road fuels fell in 1995 for the first time since 1991,
providing the first sign that the road fuel duty escalator might be having an
effect on demand.</LI>
<LI>In the long term, demand for road fuels is expected to decline if the
government maintains the road fuel duty escalator at 5pp above general
inflation.  This would probably be achieved through the use of more
fuel-efficient vehicles rather than actual reductions in traffic.</LI>
<LI>The demand for energy by households fell by 2.7% in 1995, partly reflecting
the slightly warmer temperatures than in 1994.</LI>
<LI>In the long run, household demand for energy is expected to increase at 1-1&#189;%
pa as demand for higher comfort levels and more services and an increase in the
number of households outweigh any savings in energy obtained through more
stringent building standards.</LI>
<LI>Energy consumption by the commercial sector increased by 6.8% in 1995 when
both output and employment in service sectors grew.</LI>
<LI>Commercial sector energy demand is expected to increase at just under 1% pa
for the remainder of the forecast period, reflecting continued improvements in
energy efficiency, although demand for electricity is forecast to grow much more
rapidly.</LI></UL>
<P>In terms of prospects for carbon and sulphur emissions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The switch to natural gas from the more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal
and oil is responsible for the majority of the reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB>
emissions over 1990-2005.</LI>
<LI>Emissions from power generation have fallen by nearly 20% in the first half
of the 1990s because of switching from coal into gas and increased nuclear
generation.</LI>
<LI>Emissions of CO<SUB>2</SUB> from power generation are forecast to continue
falling until the year 2000 and then increase again slightly as the
opportunities for further fuel-switching become fewer.</LI>
<LI>CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from road transport are forecast to grow only
slightly over 1995-2000 and then to fall as the impact of the road fuel duty
escalator offsets the stimulus to growth from higher economic activity.</LI>
<LI>Emissions by households are expected to increase over the forecast period
as the number of households rises and penetration of gas in the place of coal
and oil becomes more complete.</LI>
<LI>Emissions of sulphur are expected to fall by more than half from 1995 to
the end of the forecast period, with the biggest reduction coming from power
generation.</LI>
<LI>The UNECE target of a 70% reduction from 1980 SO2 levels by 2005 is
expected to be met, although beyond 2005 further measures will be needed to
reach the 80% target reduction by the year 2010.</LI></UL>
<P>Key results differentiated by fuel type and fuel user are shown in Table 1
(for final energy demand), Table 2 (for carbon emissions) and Table 3 (for
sulphur emissions).  Tables 2 and 3 differ from Table 1 in that they include
emissions arising from fuel use by power generation and other energy industries.
 Hence, coal use in Table 1 relates only to final users (industrial, commercial
and household use), whereas emissions shown in the other tables relate primarily
to coal use in power generation.  In the bottom half of Tables 2 and 3,
emissions by fuel users relate only to <I>fossil fuel</I> consumption by those
users.  Emissions from burning fossil fuels to produce electricity are allocated
to power generation.</P>

<H2>Notes for Editors</H2>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics is an independent private limited company and has
been providing detailed economic and industrial forecasts since 1978.  The
company's work also encompasses detailed industrial and regional forecasts for
the UK, and regional and sectoral forecasts for the European Union in
collaboration with ERECO, the leading network of European economic institutes.</P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics provides the most detailed long-term economic and
industrial forecasts available for the United Kingdom.  The projections are
based on the `Cambridge model', known as the Multisectoral Dynamic Model of the
UK economy (MDM), and originally developed in the University of Cambridge
Department of Applied Economics (in the `Growth Project' set up in 1960 by
Professor Sir Richard Stone, the 1984 Nobel Laureate in Economics, and Alan
Brown).  This large computerised system has approximately 5,000 endogenous
variables and nearly 16,000 behavioural parameters and other coefficients.  The
model is continually revised and improved to take account of new data and
advances in economic theory and econometric techniques.</P>
<P>The current version of the model, MDM9, has been developed over the last two
years to incorporate the 1992 Standard Industrial Classification, the change to
the 1990 price base, the 1990 Input-Output tables, and the 1995 Blue Book.  MDM
covers the whole of UK industry with its 49 sectors and is the leading
energy-environment-economy model in the UK.</P>
<P>In the energy-environment aspects of MDM, demand for 10 fuel types by 12
fuel users is modelled, and a capacity-based sub-model of the electricity supply
industry is included.  Energy demand for sectors other than power generation is
determined econometrically, and is consistent with the industrial forecasts. 
All historical energy data are consistent with the <I>Digest of UK Energy
Statistics</I>, and environmental data with the <I>Digest of Environmental
Statistics.</I></P>
<P><I>UK Energy and the Environment</I> is published twice a year, and is a
companion volume to <I>Industry and the British Economy</I>.  The co-editors
are Susan Baylis and Paul Ekins.</P>
<P>The cut-off date for the information used in the model run for this report
was May 1996.</P>
<P>Copies of the report are normally obtained by companies and government
departments by subscription to Cambridge Econometrics'
Energy-Environment-Economy Service (E3), which combines CE's energy and
environment forecasts with detailed projections for the whole UK economy. 
Individual copies of the report can be purchased for &#163;1,250, plus &#163;1,750
for <I>Industry and the British Economy</I>.</P>
