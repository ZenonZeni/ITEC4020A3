Asiaweek Continuing Special Report on Asian Languages 13/09/96

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Khalid ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Saud (1913-1982) former monarch of
Saudi Arabia and son of Ibn Saud, the founder of the kingdom.
A well-liked moderate, Khalid rose to the throne in 1975 after
the assassination of his half brother Faisal and continued
with the latter's economic and social reforms. Upon his death,
Khalid was succeeded by a half brother, the currently reigning
King Fahd. TRIVIA: Khalid was the first foreign head of state
to pay a visit to France's Elysee Palace after Francois
Mitterrand came to power.

Khalistan literally "Land of the Pure" in PUNJABI. Name for
the (as yet unfulfilled) independent Sikh state demanded by
militant adherents of the religion. In its purest sense, such
an entity would include not only the Indian state of Punjab,
but also the adjacent territories that once belonged to the
realm of the great Sikh leader Ranjit Singh (1780-1839).

Khalkha the dominant Mongol group, making up more than three-
quarters of Mongolia's population. The word also refers to the
language, which is spoken by 1.8 million people in Mongolia
and is the country's official tongue, and the territory
controlled by the Khalkha people in the past (once also known
as Outer Mongolia). Khalkha submitted to Chinese rule in the
late 17th century, but declared independence when the Qing
dynasty collapsed in 1912. It became the Mongolian People's
Republic in 1924. (The "people's republic" was dropped from
the name in 1992.)

Khalsa (FIG.1) from PERSIAN khales, meaning "pure." Religious,
military and social brotherhood established by the last Sikh
guru, Gobind Singh, in 1699. Now the dominant order of
Sikhism. Upon reaching puberty, most Sikh children are
initiated into the Khalsa. After the ceremony (amritsanskar),
they assume the surname "Singh" (Lion) or "Kaur" (Lioness).
Khalsa members (called amritdhari) are required to distinguish
themselves by bearing the Five K's: kesh (uncut hair -
representing spirituality), kangha (comb - spiritual order and
discipline), kara (steel bracelet - unity with God and
allegiance to the Khalsa), kirpan (sword - courage, dignity
and self-sacrifice) and kachha (short trousers - moral
restraint). They must also adhere to a strict code of conduct;
one is prohibited from consuming intoxicants (especially
tobacco), engaging in adultery and dyeing or plucking out
white hair. Sikhs not belonging to the Khalsa are called the
sahajdhari ("slow adopters").

khalwat MALAY in Islam, the offense committed when a man and a
woman, who are not married to each other, are in close
proximity to each other in a secluded area. If you take your
girlfriend into your house in the evening, a nosy neighbor may
well assume you are up to hanky-panky and notify the religious
authorities. (Every once in a while, there is a highly
publicized case where a well-known politician, a prominent
businessman or a film star gets caught in such a situation.)
Being a popular destination for lovers, Kuala Lumpur's scenic
Lake Gardens are a particularly fruitful area for religious
officers after dark. Errant couples looking for a quiet spot
may well find themselves being pounced on by the eagle-eyed
enforcers and ordered to appear in court, where a fine or a
promise to get married is extracted from them. Non-Muslims are
exempt from charges of khalwat.

Khamenei, Ayatollah Seyed Ali (FIG.2) (b. 1940) Iran's
spiritual leader. Once a student under Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, Khamenei was imprisoned six times and exiled during
the rule of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. After the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, he served as Iran's president from 1981 to 1989
and succeeded Khomeini as the supreme religious leader when
the latter died in 1989. He is something of a scholar-figure
who did not shrink from lecturing on Islamic theology when
addressing the United Nations in 1987 (he also did not refrain
from fulminating against the U.S., causing the American
delegates to walk out). He does not have the use of his right
hand - the result of an 1981 assassination attempt in which a
tape recorder with a bomb hidden inside was placed on the
lectern while he was giving a sermon.

khamsin hot, dry and dusty southerly wind that occurs in North
Africa and the Arabian peninsula. Reaches temperatures of up
to 40 C. The name is derived from an ARABIC word meaning
"fifty" (referring to the approximate number of days the wind
lasts each year).

Khamtay Siphandone (b. 1924) prime minister of Laos. A
postman-turned-revolutionary, Khamtay served as the military
commander of the Pathet Lao movement and was appointed deputy
prime minister and defense minister when the Lao People's
Democratic Republic was established in 1975. Succeeded Kaysone
Phomvihane as PM in 1991 and, upon the latter's death in 1992,
as head of the ruling Lao People's Revolutionary Party.

Khan, Imran (FIG.3) (b. 1952) Pakistani cricket great of
Pathan stock. Making his not-so-auspicious Test debut in 1971
against England, Khan shook off his jittery beginnings to
achieve a reputation as one of the best all-rounders (i.e.,
proficient in both bowling and batting) in the history of the
sport. He captained the Pakistani team from 1982 to 1992 (with
two brief breaks due to injury and a short-lived retirement)
and crowned his illustrious career by leading his country to
its first World Cup title in 1992. As durable as his
reputation on the field was his image as a playboy: the one-
time most eligible bachelor was long known for his string of
high-society girlfriends. He ended up marrying Jemima
Goldsmith, a wealthy British financier's daughter half his
age, raising more than a few eyebrows - and probably breaking
more than a few hearts - in the process. Now retired, he is
presently lavishing his attention on his Shaukat Khanum Cancer
Hospital - named after his mother, who died of cancer in 1985
- and harboring political ambitions (he recently launched
Tehreek-e-Insaf, or Movement for Justice).

Khan, Jahangir (b. 1963) Pakistani squash great of Pathan
stock. Coming from a family of squash champions (father
Roshan, uncles Hashim and Azam, and cousin Mohibullah
dominated the sport in the 1950s and '60s), Khan burst into
the international squash scene in 1979 by becoming the first
unseeded - and, at 15, the youngest - player to win the World
Amateur Championship. In 1981, he embarked on a remarkable
five-year unbeaten streak of more than 500 games; when the run
came to an end, he was still only 22. Towards the end of the
1980s, Khan seemed less invincible but nevertheless won his
sixth World Open title in 1988 and the British Open for an
unprecedented 10th consecutive time in 1991, silencing those
who had dismissed him as over the hill.

Khan, Jansher (b. 1969) another Pakistani squash great of
Pathan stock (no relation to Jahangir). Currently ranked No.1
in the world, Jansher first came to the world's attention when
he beat Jahangir in 1987 (he went on to defeat his older
compatriot in their next 10 encounters). The kind of respect
and adulation showered on Jahangir, however, has been slower
in coming to Jansher, partly because of his somewhat abrasive
personality.

BUSINESS: Stocks To Watch: It"s the Economy, Stupid: Buying bank stocks?
Look at the big picture first 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Assif Shameen

Anyone bottom fishing for cheap stocks in Asia these days is
likely to dredge up a number of big-name bank stocks. Be
selective. "It's not a good time to be in Asian bank stocks,"
warns Robert Zielinski, regional bank analyst at Jardine
Fleming in Singapore. "Banking really is 95% macro-economics."
Powerhouses from Singapore to South Korea are starting to slow
down partly because of a slump in electronics demand but also
because it is simply time for a breather after years of heady
growth. "Banks generally are very sensitive to levels of
economic activity," says Simon Smithson, a regional bank
analyst for Kleinwort Benson Securities. "There is a prima
facie case for more circumspection in investing in banks."

But there are bright spots. Zielinski is enthusiastic about
the Philippines, which surprised analysts last week by
announcing better-than-expected first-half GNP growth of 7%.
"Wow!" he says. "It's a fantastic economic recovery and growth
story. Most bank stocks there are up more than 50% this year."
The Manila stock market may be nearly a year away from its
peak, he says, because "the Philippine economic cycle is about
two years behind Malaysia and about three years behind
Thailand." Raymond Lee, an analyst for Lehman Brothers, is
bullish on Hong Kong: "The economy is picking up not only
there but also in China. People talk about U.S. interest rates
rising but you have to realize that the Hong Kong economy is
now much more closely linked with China, where interest rates
are heading downward."

So which counters look good? John Hobson, a bank analyst at
Morgan Stanley Asia, says his house has a buy on eight bank
stocks worldwide but only one of them is in Asia - that's HSBC
Holdings, which controls Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank. The
counter is a favorite with many industry watchers. "HSBC has
great regional exposure," says Lehman's Lee. "They've targeted
the growing affluent class in Asia, and as a leading bank
group in Hong Kong, they are a key beneficiary of economic
recovery in the territory and China." Smithson likes the fact
that HSBC derives nearly two-thirds of its profits from Asia.
"That proportion will go up rather than down," says the
Kleinwort analyst. "Even as it expands in Europe and the U.S.,
HSBC will remain an Asia-centered bank. It is one bank that is
well-equipped to deal with the changing nature of Asia's
banking marketplace."

Zielinski is not so sure. "HSBC has such a huge exposure in
Britain and the U.S. that bad news there can more than offset
the good news in Asia," he argues. And HSBC and subsidiary
Hang Seng have had a great run this year. "All the good news
for HSBC as well as Hang Seng and some of the other banks in
Hong Kong is already in the price," says Bonnie Lai, a bank
analyst at brokerage Yamaichi International. She favors
laggards like the International Bank of Asia: "It's a small
bank that has underperformed the market and therefore is
likely to fare better in the next few months." But Zielinski
cautions: "There are lots of imponderables in Hong Kong beyond
the July 1, 1997 handover to China. There could be a whole lot
of Chinese banks doing all sorts of things."

If he were to purchase just one Asian bank stock, says the
analyst, "I would buy Philippine National Bank." True, PNB has
disappointed analysts in the past three years with its slower-
than-anticipated recovery, but Zielinski says this time
around, the former government-controlled bank is really going
to surprise people. PNB valuations are just half those of
other comparable lenders in the Philippines. "PNB may have had
lower returns on assets and returns on equity in the past few
years, but you've got to realize this is a turnaround story,"
says Zielinski. "It will have higher earnings growth than most
other banks over the next three years. There's little downside
and lots of upside." Smithson likes Metrobank, which is bigger
than PNB. Lee says he also wants to be in the Philippines, but
worries about high valuations: "You can't pay the moon for
even the best stock."

Zielinski is bullish on big Indonesian banks BDNI, Bank
Internasional Indonesia and Bank Danamon because they are
cheap. "Indonesia, like the Philippines, is an underbanked
market," he says. "This means banks have plenty of room to
grow." One problem: interest rates. "At 20% per annum, they're
higher than what an investor can earn from bank stocks," says
Zielinski. "So over the long term, if you believe rates won't
move too much either way, you must see if the stock you are
looking at can somehow get a return of more than 20%." Lee has
other worries. "In Indonesia, the macro economic picture isn't
that bad, but you have political instability," he says. "And
the central bank is trying to control credit growth and may
increase the required capital adequacy ratio."

What about the slowing economies? Zielinski finds good value
in Korean bank stocks, especially Shinhan Bank, Commercial
Bank of Korea, Korea Long-Term Credit Bank and Kookmin Bank.
"The Korean banking sector is probably the only one in Asia
where stock prices could double or triple in two to three
years," he says. "Now is the time to be accumulating bank
shares. Many are selling at 7 to 8 times this year's earnings.
An average bank in Asia sells over two times its book value.
Korean banks are selling at 70% of book value or a third of
the Asian average." But Morgan Stanley's Hobson has a caveat:
"Unless you believe the Seoul bourse is going to rise
substantially, you should stay away from most Korean banks."
He says banks in Korea are required to make provisions against
only 50% of their stock market losses.

Lee and Smithson like Malayan Banking in Malaysia, though they
concede the stock is expensive. "If you have to pick a bank
stock there, you might as well choose Maybank," says Lee.
Smithson says Maybank is better positioned than any other
lender in Malaysia, where "concerns about overheating are
receding and there is a degree of optimism about the medium-
term macro-economic fundamentals." Zielinski has a different
take. "Malaysian bank stocks are among the most expensive in
the world and the banks are still lending like crazy to
property developers, so they can't be a bargain in the long
run," he argues. What about Singapore? Banks there, says
Zielinski, "are very exposed to the overheated property market
at a time when the government is trying to cool things."
Lenders like Overseas Union Bank do have a reputation for good
management. "But with earnings growing so slowly, I'd give
them a miss," says Smithson.

The outlook in other countries does not look much better.
Economic worries in Thailand may continue to be a drag on bank
stocks, including heavyweights like Bangkok Bank. "Slower
growth will impact on loan growth, interest margins and
possibly bad debts, and thus hurt profitability," says Lee.
"People wonder when might be a good time to start fishing in
Thailand now that the water level is so low. I believe a
further fall will make banks very attractive. But right now,
Thai banks are a high-risk punt." Hobson is worried about a
surge in the level of non-performing loans. Zielinski says
bank credit outstanding as a percentage of GDP in Thailand, as
in Malaysia, is higher than anywhere else in the world. "The
ratio of credit to the size of the economy is about 140% to
150% and that's incredibly high. When Japan was at this level
of development, its ratio of credit to GDP was 70%."

Investors should also realize that things have changed. "In
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong, it's no longer
possible to look at banks as a growth industry," says
Smithson. "The days of 30% to 40% loan growth are gone." You
may get that in India with lenders like the State Bank of
India or in the Philippines. "In the more developed markets,"
says Smithson, "banks have become a mature business." The
industry has also become more competitive, "but not all the
banks will be equally well-placed to prosper in the new
environment." Still, banks will always remain part of any
large regional portfolio. Says Hobson: "If there is no
deterioration in asset quality, you can get a better return
from a bank compared with an industrial company or one that
sells consumer goods." Just be careful about fundamentals,
price and timing.

BUSINESS: Money & Investing: Banqueting With the Bears: As prices decline,
savvy punters get hungrier 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The apparent economic slowdown in Asia this year has cooled
investor enthusiasm for stocks. But as markets fall, Hugh
Young, 38, managing director of Abtrust Fund Managers
(Singapore) Ltd., says he is becoming more bullish. The trick,
as usual, is to know where to tread. The Exeter University
graduate, who since 1985 has managed Britain's top-performing
Asian unit trust, Abtrust Pacific, spoke with Asiaweek's
Steven K.C. Poh. Excerpts:

Has the Asian growth story changed?

Overall, the longterm economic outlook for Asia is as
promising as ever. With the exception of Japan, which is
undergoing a structural, not cyclical, change and is having to
open its doors to the outside world, the forecasts for GDP
growth over the next 3 to 5 years in Asia are a comfortable
6%-7% per annum.

So, should we worry about the apparent slowdown?

That depends. I regard the slowdown we're seeing in Singapore,
and indeed throughout the region, as fundamentally healthy.
But it's also going to be painful for certain industries,
specific companies and unwary investors. Singapore is a good
example. The boom in the global electronics industry over the
past few years has had a dramatic effect, boosting economic
growth above virtually all forecasts. It surprised me that
first-quarter 1996 growth was so strong at 10.9%. Yet now
everyone is sunk in deep gloom over second-quarter growth of
7.0%. I find it hard to understand this reaction to a cyclical
event, which should have been expected. Cycles are part of
life, and so is development. Development or economic success
brings its problems and I think that is what we are seeing in
Asia today. All the region's economies are starting from a
higher base each year, so sustaining high growth levels is
ever harder. Labor, property and associated costs are all
rising; that puts pressure on margins, and eventually squeezes
certain businesses out.

What are the implications for earnings?

Corporate earnings are coming in much as we expected, but we
have had forecasts well below the consensus. Overall for our
Asian portfolios, we are seeing earnings-per-share growth
slowing to around 12% in 1996. This is a function of
increasing costs and increasing competition. With tariff
barriers coming down across the region, businesses are moving
across borders ever more rapidly. Any inefficient producers
who have traditionally been protected by tariffs will go out
of business and those who survive will have to be forward-
thinking and agile.

It sounds as if you are bearish on Asia.

No, oddly enough I'm getting more bullish as markets slip. I
think the key is knowing what you're doing. It's no longer
sufficient to close your eyes and invest in Asia, relying on
economic growth to carry you through. I think markets will
punish most concept stocks or those that have relied on
financial engineering and aggressive leverage. Conversely, the
rewards will go to stocks that invest in professionally
managed, well-financed companies - providing one is careful
about not overpaying for those earnings. For those investors
who are prepared to do the hard work there's some great value
to be had.

Is there value in sectors?

Obviously there are sectors that we naturally favor. Anything
benefiting from the growing wealth of the consumer should do
well, so we favor areas such as retail, insurance and media.
Similarly with strong economic growth, we like banks and
financial institutions. Also the infrastructure story will
remain a core investment theme in Asia for many years to come.
But at the end of the day, you have to be terribly stock
specific and focus on management because you are going to need
some skilled and visionary people to cope with all the
pressures of success that Asia is facing.

What stocks do you favor?

Among the large-capitalization issues, it is hard to do better
than some of the region's banks. Well-managed and standing on
reasonable ratings, we would buy HSBC, even after its strong
performance, and the Thai banks, such as Bangkok Bank, Siam
Commercial Bank and Thai Farmers Bank (but taking care to
access these either via the local board, if legally
permissible, or via convertible bonds). In Singapore there is
fabulous value to be discovered, but again only if one has the
ability to access the local board. The local board stocks that
look very cheap are again the banks - DBS, OCBC, OUB and UOB.
Singapore Airlines, which can be bought at asset value, and
Singapore Press Holdings are also bargains. Elsewhere among
the region's larger capitalized stocks, we are comfortable
with companies such as Indostat in Indonesia and Philippine
Long Distance Telephone and with some property companies that
are beginning to appear to be good value, such as Sime-UEP in
Malaysia and Sammakorn in Thailand.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: RATING YOUR BANK 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Every year Asiaweek ranks the region's 500 biggest commercial
banks according to assets. We also tell you how they compare
with each other in deposits, loans, net profit and
shareholders' equity. We calculate profit as a percentage of
assets and of equity (the higher the number, the more
efficiently the bank makes money), and equity as a percentage
of assets (the higher the number, the more capital the bank
can tap to deal with financial strains and emergencies). Loans
as a percentage of deposits, meanwhile, says how much a bank
is able to make use of relatively cheap deposit funds in
making lucrative loans.

In the following tables, we classify the banks by country and
indicate their moneymaking abilities, that is, their profit-
to-assets and profit-to-equity ratios, which are important in
picking what bank stocks to buy. For the first time, we also
include a table showing net interest income (NII). This tells
you how much money a bank made from its core business of
making loans plus its earnings from other assets, such as
interbank deposits, bonds, stocks and securities. Compare NII
with total net profit, and you will get an idea of how
diversified a bank is - or how dependent it is on interest
income.

Another tool: a ranking of top banks according to capital
adequacy ratio. You arrive at a lender's CAR by dividing total
capital - equity plus other assets - by the value of loans,
securities and other assets, weighted according to their
riskiness. The Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements,
which acts as a clearing house for the gold and currency
reserves of many countries, recommends a minimum CAR of 8% for
international banks. Those with higher ratios are regarded as
exceptionally stable, since they have more than enough
resources to cover risk assets.

What does this all mean to you as a depositor, borrower and
investor? As they say, forewarned is forearmed. Know thy
banker and thy bank. By all means, look for good service,
attractive deposit rates and cheap loans. But don't forget the
fundamentals. The numbers in these pages are a good starting
point.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Rapped on the Knuckles: Can Jardine Fleming
regain investor trust? 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Hong Kong's Jardine Fleming Bank, ranked No. 350 in the
Financial 500, might be thankful it focuses on treasury and
foreign-exchange transactions, not on retail services.
Ordinary depositors could have been spooked by news last week
that a Hong Kong sister company, Jardine Fleming Investment
Management, had been censured for lax controls. JFIM's London-
regulated affiliate, Jardine Fleming Asset Management or JFAM,
was fined $625,000 and had its license in Britain withdrawn.
Three other investment firms within Britain's Robert Fleming
Group, half-owner of Hong Kong-based Jardine Fleming Group,
were each penalized $156,000 for failing to make sure that
JFIM had adequate controls before entrusting it with its
clients' money.

British and Hong Kong authorities came down hard on former
JFIM senior fund manager Colin Armstrong for enriching himself
at the expense of three funds, and on former JFIM and JFAM
chief Robert Thomas for failing to adequately supervise
operations and deal with the misconduct. Armstrong, who
resigned in March, and Thomas, who was sidelined to another
part of the group a month later, had their license in Hong
Kong revoked. (Thomas was also banned from working in
Britain's fund-management industry.) Armstrong has returned an
undisclosed amount to JFIM; the company will use the money as
part of a $19.3 million compensation fund for affected
investors. "This has been a painful experience," said Henry
Strutt, managing director of the Jardine Fleming Group. "We're
glad to have been able to put the matter right."

It is not over. Asia's biggest investment manager with $22
billion in funds, Jardine Fleming faces the task of reassuring
institutional and retail clients across the region. Last week,
Robert Fleming disclosed that it had repatriated three funds
under JFIM management, worth a combined $1.1 billion, back to
London, though it insisted the move has no connection with the
investigation. The controversy comes at a bad time. The Hong
Kong government will introduce a mandatory provident fund
scheme next year, which could mean billions of dollars in new
pension money needing managers. Some of JFIM's existing
provident-fund clients are said to be looking at their
options.

JFIM had been housecleaning even before the five-month
British-Hong Kong probe was completed. It had named a new
chief of compliance and hired experts to review procedures.
JFIM says it is banning personal-account dealings and
introducing a centralized system to check when and where all
trades are routed. Because of the loopholes, Armstrong had
allegedly found it easy to delay the booking of a trade. If
the transaction was especially profitable, say the regulators,
it would be credited as a deal made by his personal account or
one particular client account. If not, it would be allocated
to another fund he manages.

Despite the disciplinary action, Armstrong has yet to be shown
to have broken any Hong Kong criminal law. And JFIM? The
challenge is to remain entrepreneurial while making sure no
regulation is breached. JFIM's success has been credited to
its free-wheeling management. "This is the same business style
lauded in the press as more dynamic than half-a-dozen of its
competitors," says an industry source. "But any system is only
as good as the people within it." The regulators - and
investors - are watching.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: A Behemoth Awakes: New Delhi"s biggest bank
reinvents itself 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

In India, a giant is stirring. The State Bank of India
(assets: $36.1 billion) is putting away its musty files and
ledgers the size of billiard tables. Chairman P.G. Kakodkar,
59, aims to computerize 1,000 branches a year. SBI has also
started streamlining management structures and delegating
power to division heads. In August, it announced the formation
of subsidiaries to handle credit cards and securities trading,
and launched a partnership with travel firm Thomas Cook to set
up a tourism development finance company. "Internationally,
the bank is positioning for a dominant presence in the cross-
border loan syndication markets and also in the issue of
Indian paper by blue-chip companies," says Kakodkar.

There is much to do. Ranked No. 63 in the Financial 500,
state-controlled SBI employs 229,000 people and has 8,763
branches in India and 49 overseas. Owned 60% by the state, SBI
is under orders not to fire people, which raises the question
of what it will do with excess staff after computerization and
streamlining. Still, improvements are beginning to show.
Customer complaints are now considered black marks that can
affect an employee's prospects. SBI offices are less often the
dingy affairs that prompted jokes about the bank's expansion
strategy: go to a village, look for a cowshed, drive away the
cattle and set up operations. "The first thing we're doing
with the computerization of branches is to rework their
interior decor," says SBI spokeswoman Ranjana Bharij.

"It's a huge task to make SBI friendlier to the ordinary
customer," says investment analyst Imran Contractor. "They
have been so used to resting on their power." Improving
service to corporations should be easier. A new commercial
accounts division has just opened a Bombay branch to serve
business groups exclusively. SBI has also reduced processing
time for all loans. "These changes will ensure that old
clients will not go away," says Prasanna Someshwar, a banking
analyst for W.I. Carr in Bombay. "This is important because
new private banks are going for big business."

Can SBI compete? Contractor says the bank is still "highly
susceptible to government interference." But Someshwar is
optimistic: "It used to be a giant which did not know where it
was headed. Now it is focused." Four years ago, SBI
commissioned Canadian management consultancy firm Mackenzie
and Co. to study ways of improving its operations. The bank
started implementing the recommendations in January. In
Kakodkar, says Someshwar, SBI has found "an instrument of
reform, not necessarily a visionary." An SBI veteran who once
headed the bank's training college and technology division,
Kakodkar became chairman only two months ago. But he knows
where the bank has been - and where it wants to go.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Too Many Lenders?: Let the market decide, says
Manila 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Edgardo Reyes has accounts with three financial institutions.
"One bank is more efficient than the others," says the
Filipino entrepreneur, "but I do business with all three
because I can get better terms that way." He is learning to
take advantage of the country's two-year-old banking
liberalization. The money people are getting an education too.
"Times have changed," says Rafael Buenaventura, president of
PCI Bank and the Bankers Association of the Philippines. "It's
no longer unusual for us bankers to wake up in the morning and
discover that changes have occurred overnight. As we scan the
morning papers over breakfast, we find out that one new bank
is about to open, a new product has been introduced, and the
government is thinking about some new means of taxation."

Welcome to the brave and ever- expanding new world of
Philippine banking. In the last few months, Filipino-owned
East-West Banking Corp., Ecology Bank, iBank and Total Savings
Bank opened their doors. Earlier, Banco Santander of Spain,
Dao Heng Bank of Hong Kong and Taiwan's Chinatrust teamed up
with Filipino partners to launch three new ventures. Last
year, 10 foreign banks - among them Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
Development Bank of Singapore and Bangkok Bank - started full-
scale operations. The tally so far: 152 institutions. "Our
banking density ratios have significantly declined from more
than 17,000 persons per bank in 1990 to about 12,500 in 1995,"
says Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson. "That is bringing
us closer to the much lower densities seen in Hong Kong and
Japan."

Good or bad? Ask the public. Pre-liberalization, the 137
mostly Filipino-owned banks offered only basic services. These
days, lenders entice clients with phone banking, automated
teller machines that sell airline tickets, high-yield savings
plans - and longer hours. "Various product and market
diversification strategies have been implemented and a host of
electronic banking innovations created to tap yet unserviced
consumer segments," says Antonio Abacan, president of
Filipino-owned Metrobank, the country's best-capitalized
commercial bank. Rates for customers have improved. In 1994,
the spread between the lowest deposit rate and the prime
lending rate was 12.5 percentage points. The gap is now only
half that.

But there are worries. After Indonesia opened up its banking
sector in 1988, hundreds of new banks and deposit-taking
companies set up shop. Some found themselves dangerously
overstretched. One casualty: medium-sized Bank Summa, which
collapsed in 1992 under the weight of $800 million in debts.
"I would like to admonish some sectors not to be too hasty in
pressing for more liberalization," says Buenaventura. "It's
premature to consider the entry of more foreign banks."

Singson insists that safeguards are in place to protect the
banking system. The central bank has increased minimum
capitalization - from $30 million to $48 million for
commercial banks - and tightened its monitoring, especially of
risk management. "Everywhere in the world, government
officials have a poor track record whenever they start
substituting their judgment for that of the market," he says.
"Business decisions are best left to the bankers." And to bank
customers.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Asian Promises: The WTO hopes to solidify them


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The financial services trade deal that took effect Sept. 1 was
a baby step on the road to open markets. Next comes the hard
part: making the tentative promises, agreed to last year in a
pact signed by 44 World Trade Organization members,
permanent. Those promises include things like increasing the
number of foreign banks allowed to operate in a given country
or permitting overseas brokerages to establish joint ventures
with local companies. Beginning Nov. 1, 1997, the signatories
will have 60 days to amend, add or withdraw promises already
made. That is not the only unfinished business. Last year, the
U.S. dropped out at the last minute. The hope is that
Washington will be more willing to deal once presidential
elections are past.

The U.S. has been especially critical of Asian nations for
practicing protectionism. Asian negotiators respond that they
see little to gain from matching the U.S. in opening markets.
How-ever, that didn't stop many from making concessions. By
sector, here are some of key ones:

BANKING

India: Increased to eight from five the number of banking
licenses it awards to foreigners each year. Also agreed not to
count automatic teller machines against the quota, which has
been a sore point between regulators and foreign banks.

Malaysia: No longer requires foreign banks to hold training
programs for Malaysians before bringing in outside
specialists. Also, foreign-owned banks now can accept foreign
currency deposits from local residents.

Philippines: Raised the limit to 49% from 40% on how much
equity in domestic banks a foreigner can buy.

South Korea: Agreed foreign financial institutions could take
minority equity positions in domestic banks for the first time
beginning this year.

Thailand: Promised to sanction two new branches for each
existing foreign bank by 1997.

INSURANCE

Japan: Will allow insurance brokers to operate in Japan,
liberalize cross-border insurance deals for ships and aircraft
of Japanese registration, and ease reserve requirements.

Malaysia: Promised to allow new foreign entities in non-life
reinsurance. Seven new licenses are pledged by June 30, 2005.

Pakistan: Established a new 51% limit for the share foreign
entities can own in new life insurance companies. The same
percentage will apply to banks' portfolio management arms.

Philippines: Liberalized market access for foreign-owned or
controlled insurance and reinsurance companies.

OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES

India: Promised to allow foreigners to incorporate local
stockbroking joint ventures as long as the foreigners didn't
own more than 49%.

Indonesia: Promised to eliminate all market access
restrictions in financial services by 2020. Before, the
promise was for only partial elimination.

Malaysia: Pledged to raise the foreign equity limit in certain
financial firms to 49% from 30% by July 1, 2000.

South Korea: Lowered the operating fund requirements for
foreign securities firms doing business in the country. More
significantly, it raised from 10% to 15% the proportion of
shares that foreigners can own in a Korean company.

NO SPEEDING

Flush with triumph at having brokered a major trade deal
without the involvement of the U.S., European Union members
scoffed at what they thought was Japanese timidity. Tokyo
wanted to give the 44 signers of the financial services treaty
a year to debate and approve the treaty in their home
capitals.

Japanese negotiators prevailed, and today it is their turn to
harrumph. Ten of the original signers missed a June 30, 1996,
deadline for ratification. Today, four EU countries have not
acted to endorse their promises, though all 10 Asian countries
that signed have.

The Asiaweek Financial 500: Bankers on Banking: The buzzwords: change and
service 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Like it or not, all of us have to deal with bankers. So what
makes that experience a boost rather than a bane? A great
institution requires a mixture of profitability,
competitiveness, quality service, innovation, corporate
responsibility and, of course, financial soundness. But it
also demands a dynamic leader to add a dash of inspiration. We
talked to head honchos of top banks about their recipes for
success. Excerpts:

Antonio Abacan, 53, president of Metrobank in the Philippines
(No. 218 in the Financial 500), knows a thing or two about
good service. "Since most products and services in the banking
system are homogenous, with minimal price differentials, many
clients have become indifferent," he says. "But one factor
that spurs customer loyalty is outstanding service." Schooled
in Western and local techniques, Abacan defines Metrobank's
vision as singularly Asian: "The Western way is
straightforward and to the letter. In our way of banking, even
if your customer's financial statement is negative but you
know his business, you will lend to him."

Amirsham Aziz, 46, managing director of Malayan Banking Berhad
(No. 70), has been working for Maybank for 19 years. The
institution has been extending loans and deposit facilities to
its customers since 1960. Amirsham puts commitment to people
first. "Being No. 1 has many responsibilities," he says. "The
public expect excellent services, our staff expect an
excellent working environment, shareholders expect superior
returns. Meanwhile, our competitors try to match every move we
make. All this sums up the need to be a truly efficient
organization which continuously strives for excellent service,
to satisfy the expectations of increasingly sophisticated
customers."

Banthoon Lamsam, 43, president of Thai Farmers Bank (No. 96),
aims to combine Asian conservatism with Western innovation.
"First, extremely careful lending, and second, changing the
way we provide services" are his winning strategies, says the
Harvard- and Princeton-trained billionaire scion of the bank's
controlling family. One of his pet peeves: long lines at
teller windows. He has trimmed them.

David Li Kwok Po, 57, deputy chairman and CEO of the Bank of
East Asia (No. 154), is one of Hong Kong's most prominent
bankers and the industry's representative on the territory's
Legislative Council. Li's family has made BEA one of the major
banking forces in the territory. He once aspired to the
Anglican Church ministry, but chose instead a more secular
career path. His secret for success? "It's confidence," says
Li. You have to convince the client that you are trustworthy
by providing good service, he urges. Do that and loyalty will
come. One strategy: student loans. Li aims to turn them into
loyal clients early.

Okkie A.T. Monterie, 51, deputy president director of Bank
Internasional Indonesia (No. 245), says transparency is one
strong reason for the bank's success. For starters, it makes
raising money offshore far easier and often cheaper.
"Investors know exactly what we're doing," he explains. "We
have a clear-cut image." He compares BII and Bank Central
Asia, the country's largest privately owned institution. "BCA
is not a public company; we are," says Okkie. "There is no
pressure on them to show a good bottom line. A public company
has more visibility, more transparency."

Peter Seah Lim Huat, 50, president and CEO of Overseas Union
Bank (No. 116), joined the Singapore lender after 10 years at
Citibank, widely regarded as one of the few truly global
institutions. That experience gave Seah a taste for thinking
internationally and keeping up with an ever-changing market.
"Consumer banking is going through a radical evolution," he
observes. "We are moving into a highly electronic environment
with a broader range of more complex products. That requires
different skills, a different mentality, retraining and
repositioning. When you have been in a business for over 40
years and are steeped in tradition, these changes are not
simple."

Yoon Byung Chul, 60, president of Hana Bank (No. 115), sees
virtue in both big banks and boutiques. "You're either a niche
bank or a universal bank that provides just about any kind of
financial service," he says. "These days there is nothing in
between." Hana is setting up a stockbroking firm and wants to
offer unit trust, insurance and other services as soon as
Korean regulators will allow them. Plainly, Asia's best banks
are hardly sitting pretty waiting for the interest to pile up.

FINANCIAL 500: The Asiaweek Financial 500: From global giants to nimble
niche players, Asia"s banks tell the secrets of success 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Ricardo Saludo and Matthew Fletcher

In a world of phonebanking, automated teller machines, online
asset switching and smartcards, Antonio Abacan has a secret
weapon. "We serve tea in all our branches," allows the
president and chief operating officer of Metropolitan Bank &
Trust Co., the Philippines' largest financial institution, No.
218 in The Asiaweek Financial 500 ranking of the region's
biggest banks.

The hot cups of Chinese brew are part of Metrobank's Asian
style. "We've developed a niche - Filipino-Chinese
businessmen," Abacan says. One such client, a Mr. Angpin,
appreciates the familiar touch: "They know the Asian way. You
can drop by, give a bag of money to the manager for deposit,
and not bother counting the money." Yes, confirms Abacan, "our
teller will later call him to say, `Your deposit is 1 million
pesos.' Other banks try to imitate our style, but this kind of
trust takes years and years to cultivate."

As competition hots up in the liberalizing world of Asian
banking, the leading players are finding that tried and tested
ways are just as important in staying ahead as the latest high
tech and financial legerdemain. Banker-legislator David Li
Kwok Po, chief executive of Hong Kong's third-ranked Bank of
East Asia (No. 154 in the 500), breaks no news when he
expounds on BEA's success formula: generating confidence,
providing strong service and building relationships. Plus a
maverick streak: the bank's early push into China has made it
probably the most profitable foreign player on the mainland.
"You can't be too aggressive because your customers won't like
that," Li explains. "But you can't be too conservative either.
It's hard to get the mix right."

But mix the top banks must. This special report looks at how
some of the best performers in key Asian markets cope with
rising competition and rapid change. Their moves and those of
the regional industry are major factors in shifts among the
Financial 500 banks. Now in its third year, the annual ranking
(starting on page 60) again chronicles in telling numbers the
surges and strains of Asian banking. Trillion-yen write-offs
in Japan? No wonder the 500's top 20 lossmakers are Japanese.
Roaring economies in Greater China? Indeed: with just 15% of
the 500's assets, banks from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan
generated nearly 40% of all profits.

The world's largest financial institution as of March 31,
1996, the end of the fiscal year covered by the 500, was Dai-
Ichi Kangyo Bank (assets: $536.6 billion). But DKB's return to
first place (it was No. 1 for years during the 1980s) lasted
but a day. The newly merged Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, with
combined assets of $791 billion, dwarfed it on April 1 - and
pointed to the likely future of Japanese banking. Faced with
monstrous dud loans and equally gigantic competition, and
urged by the Finance Ministry, lenders in Japan are seeking
strength in tie-ups and takeovers. Four institutions with
stakes in Taiheiyo (No. 169) are rescuing that lender. Nippon
Trust (No. 131) cut its losses by $1.2 billion after it was
taken over by Mitsubishi Bank (No. 3). The latter's merger
with Bank of Tokyo (No. 12) is just the latest union among
several in recent years, which also created Sakura Bank, No. 1
in the previous Financial 500.

The marriages and write-offs by Japanese institutions
highlight a key plank in the strategies of topnotch Asian
banks: Beef up your capital. Singapore's Overseas Union Bank
(No. 116) plans a big push in both regional and consumer
banking. For that, OUB and its subsidiaries have more than
tripled their capital to over $2 billion since 1992,
polevaulting from 400 to 162 in the ranks of world banking
groups by capital funding, and fifth in ASEAN. "Our much
larger size has enabled us to effectively penetrate [loan]
syndication markets in Thailand, China, Hong Kong and even
Australia," says OUB chief Peter Seah Lim Huat. The heftier
equity base has also helped it acquire Chase Manhattan's
credit-card business in Singapore. With investment banking
ambitions, Japan's Sanwa Bank has augmented its capital by
cashing in some $1.3 billion in stocks. That lifted its
capital adequacy ratio to 9.12%, well above the 8% recommended
for international institutions and despite a $9.2-billion
write-off charged against equity.

The urge to merge is also spurred by intense competition. "You
will see it happening in Hong Kong," says Thomas Koetzsch, a
Hong Kong-based analyst for bank rating agency Capital
Intelligence. "There are too many banks." And more are coming,
from outside and inside Asia. Bank Austria is among the latest
Western institutions following corporate clients to Asia.
Koetzsch reckons Hong Kong could see local tie-ups or
purchases by mainland banks of Hong Kong institutions after
next year's reunification with China. Many large Chinese banks
are eager to widen their presence in Hong Kong, and "the
`easiest' way seems to be to buy a local bank," says Koetzsch.
London-based HSBC Holdings, parent of the Hongkong & Shanghai
Banking Corp. (No. 19), is rumored to be among the suitors for
Australia's state-controlled ANZ, whose strengths in South
Asia, Australasia and the South Pacific would complement
HSBC's reach. The new government in Canberra is believed to be
open to a foreign takeover.

Asian banks revving up for tougher competition also need to
enhance their human and technological resources. Sheltered
domestic markets, steeled by high regulatory walls, once led
to world-beating spreads and profits. But they left homegrown
institutions short on technology, innovation and marketing
savvy. "The prosperity of Asian banks is due not to good
management or innovation, but to protectionism and cartels,"
says Robert Zielinski, research chief of Jardine Fleming
brokerage firm in Singapore. "Banks have become fat and
inefficient." But they're changing, says analyst Phuah Eng
Chye of Kleinwort Benson Research in Kuala Lumpur. "Banks are
focusing on how to reinvent themselves. Once complacent, they
are now more alert and flexible."

At least, that's the goal. For Thai Farmers Bank's billionaire
boss Banthoon Lamsam, it means only one thing: Build a
service-oriented staff. "Our service was terrible - that was
the assumption from the beginning," says the Ivy Leaguer,
whose ethnic Chinese family founded Thai Farmers (No. 96 in
the 500) in 1945. He partly blames entrenched habits in the
domestic industry, where banks tend to be "very bureaucratic
and controlled by a closed group who take advantage of
consumers." Banthoon's solution: new technology and training
people for high performance.

Overcoming employee resistance to change has been the toughest
challenge, he says. To meet it, Banthoon revamped and
revitalized a core group of about 200 managers, imparting to
them his vision of Thai Farmers as a world-class player.
Result: online accounts, phonebanking, automatic bill payments
and credit-card clearance are now standard. Queues at Thai
Farmers are much shorter. And the improvements are getting
noticed. "Thai Farmers is perceived as a bank with vision and
a long-term plan to stay competitive," says Susheel Neruda,
head of research at Seamico Securities in Bangkok.

Metrobank's Abacan has also worked to improve employee morale,
teamwork and drive. He has helped create a spirit of
belonging, which has spurred staff to work long and hard and
be loyal (average length of service among senior executives:
27 years). Bank chairman George Ty himself sets the example,
at 64 still at his desk every day. Another morale boost:
spouses are often invited to bank functions. "They're family,"
says Abacan. Also boasting high productivity, Bank
Internasional Indonesia (No. 245), which has to make the most
of its relatively small headcount - 5,800 - spread among 170
branches. "We're very much lower in operating expenses vis-a-
vis competitors," says senior v.p. Manuel Sia, a Filipino who
joined BII in 1990. That has helped give the bank a 23.6%
return on equity, highest among the top 20 Indonesian banks.

Part of the Sinar Mas wood-based empire, the Jakarta-based
institution has grappled with another issue facing Asian banks
in a changing industry: universal vs. niche banking. Does a
bank offer a full range of services to all comers, or focus on
a narrow stratum of services and customers? But whichever one
chooses, the imperative, as BII has seen, remains the same:
Develop a market position. A bank should resolve the
universal-niche issue based not on theoretical arguments
favoring one or the other, but on what its market demands. And
once chosen, the market position should be developed by
gearing up to service the target clients and publicizing the
kind of bank one aims to be.

"In the beginning we were looking at corporate banking, but it
didn't make sense," recounts BII deputy president-director
Okkie A.T. Monterie. He saw that Indonesia's growing ranks of
affluent consumers wanted bankers that could offer everything
from car loans to credit cards. Three years ago BII shifted
gear. "The right direction for Indonesia is universal or
supermarket banking," says Okkie, who notes that two other
corporate-oriented players, Bank Niaga (No. 324) and Bank Bira
(No. 427), are going the retail banking route. BII seems well-
advanced on that road - literally: to better publicize its
consumer tack, it has bright red ads touring Jakarta on the
bodies of public buses.

Building a market position from scratch is a daunting
challenge, of course. One solution: take over a successful
operation, which will bring with it the hard-to-duplicate
customer relationships that underpin any banking operation.
HSBC bought J.P. Morgan bank's dollar-clearing unit, vaulting
itself into the top five in the global business, handling $80
billion a day for some 700 institutional clients. The quest
for an instant market base on which to build motivates buyouts
of consumer banking businesses like Chase's credit-card
operation in Singapore. That acquisition, says OUB's Seah, has
been "instrumental in energizing the rest of our consumer
business." For its part, Taipei-based Chinatrust Bank (No.
144) stole a march on rivals with a different kind of tie-up:
with auto dealers for its push into car loans. It's the same
tack for BEA, which is linking up with German marque Mercedes
Benz in China. "They have the name," says CEO Li. "We build
the relationship."

Like market position, the issue of technology suffers from
slogan-ridden herd-driven thinking. Everyone is innovating, so
banks feel they have to or else. Asia's smart bankers follow a
hard-nosed, market-led rule of thumb: Use technology to reach
the client. Not to impress other bankers or follow the fad,
but to improve service and boost profits. Old-style banking
required the public to travel across town, line up before
tellers and fill out complicated forms. The high-tech variety
enables customers to avail themselves of the same services and
more from the comfort of their office desk or bedside table.
Financing is arranged when it is needed: as the client buys
something.

Hongkong Bank aims to use that strategy in its drive for the
high-end consumer market. So will its subsidiary Hang Seng
(No. 49), which is targeting a mass market that is only now
becoming comfortable with innovations like phonebanking and
credit cards. Helping HSBC's techno-ambitions is its size: it
can spread the cost over eight major affiliate institutions,
including Midland Bank, one of Britain's top four, and
America's Marine Midland.

For Metrobank, high tech and modern systems helped it reach
out to the thousands of Filipino workers overseas. Its Private
Electronic Remittance and Communication System handles large
volumes of money remittances fast. The service allows cash to
be withdrawn by a worker's family in the Philippines on the
same day he or she deposits the money at one of Metrobank's
online terminals abroad. Technology upgrades being such a
daunting operation - Thai Farmers had to re-engineer 500
branches over three years - they have to pay for themselves
and more. And they can if they bring in customers.

What about going international? Under the World Trade
Organization's financial services deal, banking markets in
many countries are opening up. But Kleinwort Benson's Phuah
believes for most of the region's institutions, "globalization
does not appear feasible because Asian banks are not clear
what objectives can be achieved. How does opening a branch in,
say, New York, London or Tokyo contribute to profitability?"
He expects banks with international ambitions to expand
regionally first. But Amirsham Aziz, head of top-ranked
Malayan Banking (No. 70) goes further back: "To be successful
abroad, you would need to first succeed in your own market.
Then you would need to know the foreign country well and make
sure you can be an important component in its development."

Maybank is itself grappling with the challenges of banking in
the New Asian Economy, where old developmental priorities have
given way to the demands of fast-expanding affluence and
regional business. Its experience mirrors those of other
established Asian lenders, most of which started as conduits
of funds for early industrialization and infrastructure.
"Maybank was established in 1960, when the country had just
achieved independence," recounts Amirsham. "We played our role
as a mobilizer of capital for economic development."

Such institutions were more concerned with bankrolling roads,
bridges and factories than attending to their bottom line. Now
that their nations have achieved economic strength, they
ironically face the prospect of losing the fruits of their
nation-building efforts to newcomers more attuned to such
thrusts as consumer financing and investment management. In
Korea, for instance, while the largest lenders creak under
non-performing business loans built up during the decades of
rapid industrialization, a relative upstart like Shinhan Bank
(est. 1981, No. 61 in the 500) can plot bold moves with its
clean balance sheet.

Can the established lenders of the development years adapt and
profit from the very success they helped create? Maybank,
which serviced mainly companies during the development years,
has been moving to develop its consumer banking business. In
this endeavor, Amirsham points out, "the bank's early
expansion to reach various segments of the people gives us a
strong market presence." He adds that the bank's development
orientation also imbued it with concern for the client.
"Meeting customers' needs has always been at the forefront of
everything we do," stresses the CEO, a 19-year veteran at the
bank. "We've also adopted a philosophy that values long-term
relationships with our customers."

In sum, nation-building lenders may in fact have the same
traits that could win them loyal customers in today's boom
times if - a big one - they can target the new class of
clients. But in doing so, Asian institutions need to maintain
a cautious conservatism in the face of unfamiliar booms that
could so easily go bust, as Japan's bubble-economy bankers
have seen. Kleinwort Benson's Phuah rings out a familiar
warning about Kuala Lumpur, which would apply to many other
Asian cities: "Easy liquidity has fueled asset prices,
especially in property. If there's a severe fallout, bad debts
could rise."

At the same time, years of intimate experience in Asia's
markets give its lenders a unique plus. Says Chinatrust
executive Steve Chou: "Imagine a multinational walking into a
laundry shop to evaluate credit risk. Local banks have lived
with these people so many years, they know." Whether gauging
risk, building relationships or just having tea, the ultimate
tenet in regional finance seems clear: Banks in Asia can win
by being Asian. After all, in a business built on trust, it
helps to be one of the family.

PEOPLE: Now, Enter the Mongolian: Sumo fans would have to wrestle with a
name like Daba Badobayaru 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Sumo fans would have to wrestle with a name like Daba
Badobayaru. So in Japan, he is known as Kyo-kushuzan. But,
whatever his name, fame beckons the 23-year-old Mongolian. He
has become the first wrestler from his country - and only the
sixth foreigner ever - to compete in the top makuuchi level of
the sport. The current three other non-Japanese wrestlers are
all Hawaii-born. "It was painful adjusting to Japan in terms
of language and food," said Kyokushuzan - though his 1.83-
meter, 121-kg frame suggests he has now mastered the cuisine
at least. Kyokushuzan has made giant steps since 1992 when he
launched his Japan career in Osaka. Last week he barged into
the elite 40 of about 800 professional sumo rikishi. "I'm a
happy man," he told journalists. No one in the audience dared
dispute him.

PEOPLE: To Coach or To Be Coached?: "I would like to coach," says former
women"s world table tennis champion... 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

"I would like to coach," says former women's world table
tennis champion Jiao Zhimin. "I have not played at all since I
came to South Korea. I played ping-pong for 18 years in China
and I think that is enough." But, if Jiao's fans have their
way, she is unlikely to hold a ping-pong paddle again. Since
settling in Seoul, the former Chinese athlete has been a TV
and newspaper reporter, a model, and, most recently, an
actress in Daughters-in-Law From Three Countries, a TV mini-
series. Jiao caught the fancy of Koreans when she and Korean
table tennis player Ahn Jae Hyung fell in love during the 1986
Asian Games. They married in December 1989 and now have a
five-year-old son. For all her fame, Jiao, 33, says she still
isn't comfortable acting. "It's very hard, especially since my
Korean isn't that good yet," she says. "When I memorized my
lines, my acting was bad. And when I acted okay, I would
forget the words." Right, maybe coaching would come more
naturally.

PEOPLE: The Mee Pok Girl: Singaporean actress Michelle Goh may be last
year"s movie sensation... 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Singaporean actress Michelle Goh may be last year's movie
sensation, but in a country with a track record of rarely
making more than one film a year, she's still a big deal. Goh
played the female lead character, Bunny, a prostitute, in
director Eric Khoo's drama Mee Pok Man, about a noddle-seller.
About a year (and 22 international film festivals) since the
movie was released, she's still known as the "Mee Pok Girl."
Postcards of Goh (barely) dressed in a bra-top and tight
shorts were a popular giveaway offered to subscribers to an
online magazine. She has also taken part in a Japanese TV
special called Asian Beauties and has cut a couple of songs
for a CD. Goh, 22, who had never acted before last year, will
soon be starring in a soap, My Grandson The Doctor, on
primetime Singapore television. Prior to showbusiness, she had
a different kind of high-flying career - as a Cathay Pacific
flight attendant.

Technology Computers: Tick Tock Goes the Clock: Experts race to head off
the Year 2000 crisis 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Jose Manuel Tesoro

The way the doomsdayers tell it, the world as we know it will
end at midnight, Dec. 31, 1999. The second the next millennium
begins, people will be recorded with negative ages. Phone
calls will be billed in millions of dollars. Instead of paying
interest due on loans, borrowers will receive a percentage of
what they owe - while depositors will be asked to pay banks
part of their savings. Building security systems may fail,
financial markets could be paralyzed.

All this is forecast to happen because computer programmers
decided over 30 years ago to save on data storage space by
designating years with two-digit numbers. They assumed that by
the time the 1990s rolled around, hardware and software would
have been replaced by versions that do not assume all dates
are in the 20th century. The old "legacy" systems think "00"
signifies 1900 - so at the beginning of the next millennium,
they will start calculating current bills, interest-rate
payments, pension disbursements, bond maturities, mortgages
and the like as if they began, ended or spanned the beginning
of the century. The bug will affect both personal computers
and mainframes.

Since business and government have become so dependent on
computers for data processing and analysis, the stroke of
midnight could have an ominous ring to it (see box). Ana-lysts
have likened the so-called Year 2000 problem to a virus -
though it technically is not one - since it is so wide-spread
and so dangerous. U.S.-based market research firm the Gartner
Group estimates that fixing the "millennium bug," which may
require rewriting millions of lines of computer code, will
cost $600 billion. Last April, its research director, Bruce
Hall, told the U.S. Congress that "the Year 2000 virus is the
most devastating ever to infect the world's business systems."

That dire? Maybe not. Many companies - both computer suppliers
and their customers - have long been aware of the bug and have
been working on solutions. In addition, Asia generally has the
advantage of having adopted the latest technologies, which
have benefited from the results of this awareness. So, as with
many things in the region, the Year 2000 crisis could end up
being the Year 2000 moneymaking opportunity.

"It's a business problem - and people really have to take the
bit between their teeth," says Ray Muller, business consulting
manager for CSSL, a Hong Kong-based reseller of IBM mainframes
that will soon launch a consulting division to offer clients
solutions to their Year 2000 problems.

Dozens of U.S. and European companies are already in the
market. Software and services company Compuware, for instance,
offers a package that includes software products as well as
programming professionals to diagnose, test and solve problem
applications. The process, says Andy Lewandowski, Compuware's
manager of international operations, will "take a lot of human
intervention." Though off-the-shelf solutions exist, rewriting
customized code will need people.

That is good news for India, which has a wealth of computer
professionals. Over 50 Indian companies working on ways to
squash the millennium bug have formed a special interest group
to promote their services. "We will offer cheap, quick and
easy solutions to the problem," says industry spokesman Dewan
Mehta. These companies feel that they can grab around $5
billion of the global business.

"The tools to solve this problem are the same everywhere,"
says Raghavendra Rao of Hyderabad-based Satyam Com-puters.
"But it requires extensive manual intervention. And people
costs in India are cheaper - less than half of those in the
U.S." The Gartner Group estimates that farming codework out to
offshore sites such as India will cut costs by 40%.

The Indians think the Gartner estimate of $600 billion is
high. Mehta says the final figure is likely to be between $60
billion and $200 billion. One reason: many companies have
addressed the problem early. Hongkong Bank, for example, began
making its systems "Year 2000-compliant" in the mid-1980s. "We
knew it would be a problem," says Bob Carlson, the bank's
technical services director. So the company simply included
Year 2000 compliance as part of its normal program of up-
grades. The bug "is a real problem," Carlson acknowledges,
"but the situation is being exacerbated by some of the people
who have most to gain from offering services to fix it."

Hongkong Bank has been aided by the relative newness of its
systems. Many U.S. and European companies adopted - and still
use - technologies from the 1970s and early 1980s. Still, says
Compuware's Lewandowski, Asia's slight advantage should not be
an excuse for complacency. "Never assume anything," he warns.
Preparing for the Year 2000 should be every business's
business.

COME MIDNIGHT

Some examples of what might happen:

Computers could subtract birth years from 1900, giving people
negative ages.

Jan. 1, 1990, was a weekday. Jan. 1, 2000, falls on a weekend.
Bank vaults might open automatically.

PC clocks may go back to Jan. 1,  1980, ruining date-based
data. But not those with Mac OS and Windows95, which are Year
2000- compliant.

Entertainment: Borrowed by Bollywood: Indian movies have some very familiar
scenes 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Originality is one thing not expected of the strange and
mongrelized world of the Indian cinema. Given a choice between
creating their own ideas and "borrowing" someone else's,
producers can be counted on to take the easy option. In this
sense, Bollywood, as India's Bombay-based movie industry is
called, is an apt name. It suggests a cut-rate, bloated and
folly-ridden version of Hollywood.

Alert copyright lawyers could make a killing from an industry
that doesn't settle for stealing merely ideas. Some Indian
directors also lift scenes, dialogue, music, posters and
billboards. Try, for instance, to spot the artistic difference
in the posters, right, for Hollywood's Mr. Jones, starring
Richard Gere, and Bolly-wood's Akele Hum Akele Tum (I'm Alone,
You're Alone). Naturally, the Indian movie is also a faithful
copy of the original.

In one of the most celebrated cases of borrowing in recent
years, the famous scene in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables,
when a baby carriage bumps its way down a staircase - itself a
nod to Eisenstein's Battle-ship Potemkin - was reproduced in
its entirety in N. Chandra's Tejaab (Acid).

At the moment, there are three Hindi versions of Sleeping With
the Enemy playing to packed houses in Indian cinemas. Each
puts a new, uniquely subcontinental twist on an already warped
theme. In one, titled Yaarana (Friends), the eternal triangle
is resolved with a macho male-bonding finale. In another, Agni
Sakshi (As Fire Is My Witness), the harassed wife becomes a
vamp, while the stalker is portrayed as the wronged party. And
in Daraar (Fear), the busty and popular Juhi Chawla plays a
gyrating song-and-dance version of the Julia Roberts
character.

Director Mahesh Bhatt's most recent effort, Phir Teri Kahani
Yaad Aagaye (Your Memory Comes Back to Haunt Me), is a copy of
Basic Instinct. Bhatt's daughter, Pooja, plays Sharon Stone.
She also recently made tabloid headlines by appearing on a
magazine cover wearing body paint. Daring stuff, except that
Demi Moore did it better on the front of Vanity Fair - and
without the bulky bikini that Bhatt wore.

A new TV series, From Hollywood to Bollywood, is attracting
big audiences with its formula of juxtaposing scenes from
Western films with their Indian copies. The series has
provided a new understanding of where Bombay's filmmakers pick
up what they call their inspiration.

Books: Hot Buttons: A spy novel that gets behind the headlines 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Derek Parker

The political thriller has never really taken off as an Asian
genre. Perhaps authors think that the field is crowded, with
tomes by Tom Clancy and the more elegant products of John le
Carre. But The Tim-Tim Man (Penfolk, Ashwood, Victoria,
Australia, 567 pages, A$19.95, paperback) is a valiant attempt
at mixing up an Asian brew of political conspiracy against an
historical and factual background. The author, Kerry Collison,
is Australian-born, although he is now an Indonesian citizen.
He once served as a diplomat in Jakarta and has a sound
understanding of the country and its politics.

His protagonist, Stephen Coleman, is  a middle-level
Australian diplomat who also happens to be a spy. Caught up in
the coup that toppled Sukarno, he makes contact with a rising
star of the Indonesian army, Nathan Seda. They form a
lucrative business alliance based on secret arms sales for
Indonesia's armed forces. But Seda has a hidden agenda: East
Timorese by birth, his ultimate aim is independence for his
native island. He secretly steers weapons and money to the
Fretilin resistance fighters.

The book begins in the turbulent mid-1960s, and tracks Seda's
rise through the 1970s and 1980s. Sometime in the near future
he is within sight of the ultimate political prize. Yet the
"Tim-Tim man" (slang for Timor) never forgets his real
mission, independence for East Timor, carefully disguising his
ambition behind a lot of national unity bluster. To achieve
this goal, Seda plans to provoke war between Indonesia and
Australia by planting a bomb in Australia's Parliament.

Meanwhile, the head of the Australian secret service is also
conniving. He  sees some benefit from a nice little war, and
he manipulates Coleman, who has fallen out with his former
friend, into a plot to kill the general. The labyrinth of
deception and counter-deception ends, literally, with a bang,
although not one which any of the protagonists had planned.

The author hits all the hot buttons: corruption, East Timor,
the Suharto succession and sometimes touchy Australian-
Indonesia relations. So it is not surprising that Indonesian
customs officers burned an early consignment of the book,
although the action seemed to to be the result of a lower-
level misunderstanding rather than orders from the top.

Regrettably, Collison cannot resist the temptation to
editorialize about Indonesian politics and sometimes seems to
lose the thread of the narrative as he pursues various
sidetracks. The key to success in a thriller is to keep the
story moving, and he only just manages to avoid getting bogged
down. Perhaps his second novel, to be called Merdeka Square,
will show a defter touch.

IN BRIEF: A spice that heals  Relations between India and the U.S. are
spicing up - literally 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

A spice that heals  Relations between India and the U.S. are
spicing up - literally. The Indian government's Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research is to challenge the patent
for turmeric granted in 1994 to two Americans who argued that
the herb's active ingredients have medicinal qualities as an
antiseptic.

Known to South Asians as haldi and to botanists as Curcuma
longa, turmeric is the yellow powder most commonly found in
curries. In India it is also used as a wound salve, a facial
cleanser and a disinfectant after funeral rites. In addition,
a 1992 study in the Indian Journal of Physiology and
Pharmacology found that a one-week course of the spice lowered
cholesterol levels by 29%.

Turmeric is made up of curcuminoids - anti-bacterial compounds
that also counter inflammation. AIDS patients even report that
they feel better when taking it, but it should be stressed
there is absolutely no evidence it has any effect on the HIV
virus.

So a lot more than fragrant curries are at stake here. Dr.
Ranjit Roy Chaudhury, chairman of India's Advisory Council on
Traditional Medicine, says: "We are moving towards the 21st
century and cannot keep saying we have been using these
substances for centuries as an excuse for not obtaining
patents." Dr. Chaudhury says Asian scientists should protect
their interests by taking out patents on herbal and
traditional treatments.

But while the international debate rages, you can use homemade
turmeric preparations whenever you wish.

Health: Inflationary Pressures: Some timely tips on avoiding intestinal gas


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Catherine Shepherd

It's an embarrassing topic. But it is a real enough problem
for all that. We all know what it is like to have stomach or
intestinal gas. Overindulging at a family banquet or having
one beer too many can be at best embarrassing, and, at worst,
very uncomfortable. So what causes gas? There are more
villains than you ever thought.

First, leave those candies and chewing gum on the shelf. When
you suck hard candy, the constant swallowing of air causes
bloating and burping. Also, sugar-free gum often contains
sorbitol - a sweetener that the bacteria in our colons gobble
up and break down to produce large amounts of gas. This makes
the muscle walls of the colon contract; you feel the
contractions as cramps. So cut back on the gum or read the
label carefully. Sorbitol and other similar sugar-free
sweeteners are often listed as "sugar alcohol" on ingredient
lists.

Avoid leftover carbohydrates. Corn and whole-grain rice form
gas-producing compounds when refrigerated. Thawing and
reheating refrigerated leftovers increases the bacterial
activity that causes gas. If you must eat leftovers, then try
them cold. If they don't go down well that way, heat only
enough for one sitting.

Fiber is an important cholesterol-lowering and colon-cancer-
preventing nutrient. But too much of it causes intestinal gas.
If you plan to add fiber to your diet, do so slowly. The
recommended intake is 25 g per day, and working up to this
amount gradually will be easier on your gut. In particular, be
wary of beans, cabbage, apples and broccoli.

Lastly, reduce your fats and oil consumption. Lowering fat
intake is sage advice for any healthful diet, but fats are
also the most difficult nutrient to digest. They can stay in
your stomach up to two hours and delay the emptying of your
intestinal tract, causing cramps and bloating. All fats,
whether from cooking oil, meats or desserts, cause the same
reaction, so refusing that third helping of fried noodles or
your second mooncake could go a long way to keeping your
stomach happy.

If you cannot avoid the culprit foods, there are a number of
ways to purge the gas from your gastro-intestinal tract.
Following a meal with a spice such as peppermint, cinnamon or
ginger will prevent vapor formation and aid digestion. Steep-
ing ginger-root or a cinnamon stick in hot water will give you
an aromatic, anti-gas tea.

Fight the tendency to lounge after a meal. Going for a brief
walk will increase the movement of gas from your digestive
system. Never lie down; it will only worsen the symptoms. And
if these drug-free remedies don't work, try an over-the-
counter gas medication, and follow the package directions
carefully.

Art: strokes of brilliance Please: Thai artists brush aside their rivals in
the third ASEAN art competition 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Julian Gearing  Bangkok

No room for the finer things of life in the business-before-
all-else world of Southeast Asia? Think again. A total of
3,624 entries were received for the ASEAN Art Awards 1996, the
third time the prestigious competition has been held.

Judging took place in the National Gallery in Bangkok, where,
to the delight of locals, Thais took the first three places.
Top prize of $10,000 went to Sakchai Uttitho, for his Life
Upcountry No. 6 - a paean to the charms of his home town of
Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand. "I am happier
there, more peaceful," says the 28-year-old, who is studying
for a masters in fine art at Bangkok's Silpakorn University.

Life Upcountry drew praise from Sawasdi Tantisuk, 71, one of
Thai-land's leading painters and a judge for the Philip
Morris-sponsored ASEAN competition. "Sakchai has composed a
natural picture of the countryside, with a strong contrast
between light and dark," he said. "It has a lot of energy,
which contributes to its beauty."

Vorakorn Metmanorom, a 28-year-old commercial artist, took
second place - and $8,000 - with Yearning for Return of
Spirituality # 1. Of his work, he says: "It is a reflection of
the fact that you need hope. Take farmers, for example. Even
if the wind is strong, if there are floods, if the crops are
not good, they always have to have determination. There is no
security for them, no guarantee the crops will be good. The
focus is on hope and determination."

In third place, with prize money of $5,000, was Light of Asia,
by Metha Kongsonthi, 25. Like Sakchai's Life Upcountry, this
swirling, colorful work is an evocative tribute to the
spirituality of northeast Thailand. Behind the top-placed
Thais came a Filipino and an Indonesian. Alfredo D. Esquillo
Jr. took fourth spot, and $3,000, with his spiritual conundrum
Daang Ligid-Krus (Cross Roads), and Sugeng Restuadi was fifth
with Life II, 1996. His prize money was $1,500.

Thais have dominated the ASEAN Art Awards since their
inception in 1994. In that year, Santi Thongsook won first
prize with his much-discussed Breath in the Capital City - a
disturbing image of a birth in the crowded streets of Bangkok.
Another Thai, Navin Biadklang, was runner-up last year. Why
this apparent Thai mastery of the Southeast Asian arts scene?

Sansern Milindasuta, chairperson of the department of visual
arts at Bangkok University, says it is partly because of
changing social attitudes. "The number of people visiting
galleries and exhibitions has increased," he says. "Also, the
number of artists has grown. Students are showing more
interest in taking up fine arts. And parents are more
understanding."

Phaptawan Suwannakudt, who runs the Place of Art gallery, says
another factor is a boom in art competitions. "Thais love
competitions," she says. "Young people try their best in them.
They follow the rules and the style and take into account the
taste of the judges."  But that, says Bangkok University's
Sansern, is one of the problems. "There is simply too much
rivalry in competitions," he argues. "There is another way to
be an artist. They can present their work in an exhibition.
That is better than entering a competition." Sansern maintains
that in the past five years or so, it has become easier to
live as a professional artist in Thailand. "There are more
private collectors, institutions and foreign collectors," he
says.

As Thailand's budding art scene continues to grow, second-
placed Vorakorn says one major incentive is missing. "We still
don't have a contemporary art gallery in Bangkok," he
complains. "So there is no place for permanent exhibitions."
Until then, Thais will continue to enter competitions - and
most likely win them.

- Entries  from the ASEAN Art Awards will be on display in the
National Museum in Kuala Lumpur Oct. 6-31.

EYEWITNESS: BOOZING BOVINES: A bottle or two of beer are all part of the
pampered lifestyles of the cows of Matsusaka 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The irony about Japan's recent food-poisoning outbreak is that
the archipelago's inhabitants are generally the most
fastidious farmers, careful cooks and demanding diners in the
known universe. Every day, some of the finest and freshest
foodstuffs end up on Japanese plates. Among these, few are
produced with as much attention to detail as "Kobe beef" from
the Matsusaka area, southeast of Osaka. Not just any cow can
be a Matsusaka cow. It must be female and virginal - or, at
least, calf-less. "Female beef is sweeter," explains farmer
Nagata Koichi, "and virginal cows are more tender if they
haven't gone through the struggles of labor." What's more, the
heifers are constantly fussed over - especially in terms of
feeding, which is astonishingly precise in its timing,
quantity and content (hay, soy, vitamins, minerals and beer).
The result: meat with the finest of fine threads of fat in
beasts worth up to $18,520 a head. In good Japanese
restaurants, that can translate to about $9 a bite.

Nations: India: The Emperor"s Troubles: The Shiv Sena boss is down, but not
out 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Ajay Singh and Arjuna

Balasaheb Thackeray, leader of the rightist Shiv Sena party,
is called Hindu Hriday Samrat by his followers, which means
"Emperor of the Hindu Heart." The 69-year-old politician has
long been proud of that title. "My power will never wane," he
once said.  But a series of recent crises suffered by
Thackeray seem to belie his boast.

The latest setback to the Hindu radical leader was the death
of one of his henchmen, Amar Naik. A powerful mafia boss in
Bombay, Maharashtra's capital and India's richest city, Naik
was wanted in connection with 28 crimes, including several
murders. In early August, police gunned down the 47-year-old
gangster as he was driving a stolen car.

The Shiv Sena, which rules Maharashtra state with the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was angered by
Naik's death. An editorial in the official Sena daily, Saamna
(Confrontation), called on the police to stop targeting Hindu
mafia dons and go after Muslim gang lords instead. It
suggested that Hindu gangs should be allowed to take over
Bombay's underworld because the city belongs to the Hindu
majority.

Naik was apparently targeted at the behest of state deputy
chief minister Gopinath Munde, who belongs to the BJP and is
in charge of the local police. According to a BJP member, the
party's high command did not take kindly to Naik's enormous
power and the patronage he received from Thackeray. The BJP is
the main opposition party in India and its regional ally's
association with a gang leader was clearly a political
handicap.

Munde is also said to be behind another problem for Thackeray.
In late July, police discovered the body of Ramesh Kini, a 45-
year-old Shiv Sena member, in a cinema in Pune, near Bombay.
Investigations revealed that the tenants in the Bombay
building in which Kini lived had been pressured for years by
their landlord, Laxmichand Shah, to vacate their flats. Shah,
who is a close friend of the Thackeray family, wanted to
demolish the building to make way for a larger apartment
block. Except for Kini, all the other tenants had either
willingly left or were forced out.

Kini's widow, Sheila, has accused Raj Thackeray, the Sena
leader's 33-year-old nephew, of complicity in her husband's
death. She alleges that Raj and Thackeray's son, Jaidev, had
threatened Kini to leave his flat a few days before he died.
Raj was questioned by police but has denied any involvement.
The Maharashtra government, apparently under pressure from
Thackeray, changed the state attorney midway through the
investigations. Sheila has demanded a federal probe into her
husband's death.

The Kini case shot to public prominence after state opposition
leader Chhagan Bhujbal raised the issue in the Maharashtra
assembly. Bhujbal, 49, was a Sena member and a confidant of
Thackeray until his defection to the Congress party four years
ago. The two politicians have been sworn enemies since then.
Says Bhujbal: "There are hundreds of cases against the
Thackeray family that have been hushed up."

Neither Thackeray nor any of his family members hold formal
posts in the government, which allows them to wield power
without being publicly accountable. Anurag Chaturvedi, a
Bombay political columnist, says the string of scandals
surrounding the Thackerays point to a steady decline in the
power and public reputation of the Shiv Sena boss. "Two years
ago, it would have been unthinkable for the police to question
a member of the Thackeray family or touch Amar Naik," he says.
"The myth of Thackeray is being eroded."

Dissent from within the Shiv Sena is also brewing. Several
senior party leaders privately criticize Thackeray for his
high-handedness. Maharashtra Chief Minister Manohar Joshi, who
is a Sena member and owes his position to Thackeray, rarely
goes out of his way now to defend his political mentor. At a
recent press conference, Sena member Madhav Deshpande
criticized Thackeray for not holding party elections. "People
are appointed at his whim," he said. "I do not want to see the
Sena committing sati [self-immolation] for the Thackerays."

But for all his problems, Thackeray is still one of Bombay's
most powerful leaders. On Aug. 20, Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda met with Thackeray in Bombay, reportedly to solicit the
Shiv Sena's support in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh state
assembly elections. The PM wants the Shiv Sena to split from
the BJP, thereby helping his  United Front Alliance win the
state. For now, Thackeray may be down, but he is definitely
not out.

Nations: Indonesia: A Split Within the Ranks: Jakarta is abuzz with talk of
a military shakeup 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Susan Berfield and Keith Loveard Jakarta

Indonesia's military has been flexing its muscles at home and
abroad. Troops patrolled Jakarta's business district with
automatic weapons in the wake of the July 27 rioting, and
security forces have since rounded up leading members of
opposition groups. Last week, the armed forces launched its
largest and most complex war games ever: some 19,000 airborne
troops, 50 warships and 41 aircraft are taking part in a 17-
day drill in the South China Sea. The site of the exercise is
the waters around the gas-rich Natuna Islands, part of which
Beijing covets.

These shows of force, however, have diverted attention from
what appears to be a growing and unusually public rift within
the military, whose political influence is unmatched by any
other national institution. For the past 30 years, the armed
forces have underpinned President Suharto's government. And
Suharto in turn has molded the armed forces to meet his own
ends. Now, the president is faced with reshaping a divided
military at a crucial time.

The army supports the president as always. But that support is
split into emerging factions. "In the old days, the armed
forces commander would go to the president and say, `This is
our position,' " says a senior officer. "Today there is no
such thing as a military position, there are only the opinions
of certain officers."

The talk in Jakarta is that Suharto, as supreme commander, is
planning a major shakeup. The rumors have prompted authorities
to issue formal denials. Nevertheless, says political
scientist Ariwibowo: "Everybody knows that something is
happening within the army."

Suharto's first move came on Aug. 15, when he sacked the Armed
Forces chief of staff Lt.-Gen. Suyono, who has been at odds
with Armed Forces commander Gen. Feisal Tanjung for some time.
Feisal, who ranks second only to the president, may himself be
in trouble. Also in danger is the military socio-political
chief, Lt.-Gen. Syarwan Hamid, who ranks just below Suyono.
All three have been criticized for the heavy-handed way the
army quelled the Jakarta riots.

In the background is the presidential succession. Suharto, who
will almost certainly seek another term in 1998, wants a
military that he can implicitly count on. When he does
eventually step down, he is expected to cede power to someone
selected from within its ranks. That person must be able to
protect the president's family and their business interests.
In the meantime, "the military is being transformed into a
palace guard for a president facing an uncertain future," says
Australian analyst Gerry van Klinken of the Indonesia
Resources and Information Program in Melbourne.

Rival generals are scrambling to secure the high ground. The
tensions center on two pivotal figures: Gen. Feisal and army
commander Gen. Hartono. Each has civilian allies. Feisal is
backed by Research and Technology Minister B.J. Habibie, who
is also chairman of the prominent Muslim group known as ICMI.
Hartono is backed by Suharto's daughter Siti Hardyanti Rukmana
(Tutut), who is a leading official of the ruling Golkar group.
One well-connected ex-intelligence officer told Asiaweek: "The
situation is explosive."

For the moment, neither Feisal's nor Hartono's prospects look
promising. If Feisal is ousted, former Jakarta commander Lt.-
Gen. Wiranto is expected to take over, even though Hartono
outranks him. If Feisal stays, Hartono also loses. Come
November, when his appointment ends, Hartono could find
himself pushed onto the sidelines.

This would be a surprising turnabout for Hartono, given that
some have said Suharto was grooming him to be the next vice-
president, or even president if Suharto decides to step down
during his next term. Influential Muslim leader Abdurrahman
Wahid says Tutut virtually endorsed Hartono as the next
president during a recent talk to ulamas, or religious
leaders, in East Java. Says Wahid: "She told them `If you want
Hartono to be president, by God's will you will have him as
president.' "

Tutut's enthusiasm would seem to bode well for Hartono. But
according to a well-connected civil servant, "The backing of
the president's daughter doesn't necessarily mean that much.
Suharto is believed to be far more wary of Hartono than of
Feisal, who is just doing his job."

The way the armed forces commander has handled that job,
however, has caused friction. The military's violent takeover
of the Democratic Party of Indonesia's headquarters from
supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri on July 27, and its tough
response to the rioting that followed, has alarmed many. "The
armed forces bared their teeth in a way not seen for some
time," says van Klinken. The cost, he says, is an erosion of
the military's legitimacy. Even Suharto is thought to be
displeased.

What the president will do to show his displeasure, however,
is still anybody's guess. Until last week, most believed that
Gen. Feisal and Lt.-Gen. Syarwan would be the next casualties.
The once-whispered rumors of their downfall were spoken so
loudly in Jakarta that top officials have for the first time
issued formal denials. On Aug. 16, State Secretary Murdiono
said that no changes at the top were planned.

To many, that denial only confirmed that there was something
to the speculation. Syarwan later told Asiaweek that high
command had "heard nothing about [a shakeup]." And then added:
"This sort of thing doesn't happen overnight. There is a
process involved."

But when Sudomo, the head of the Supreme Advisory Council and
a Suharto confidante, also called the rumors fiction, some
figured Feisal would survive after all. He might even be
reincarnated as defense minister. Edi Sudrajat, who currently
holds that position, would then take over Sudomo's job. And
Sudomo would go into graceful retirement.

For his part, Lt.-Gen. Syarwan is fighting back. He told a
gathering of officers in Surabaya Aug. 13 that rumors of a
split within the military were "divide-and-conquer" tactics
used by enemies of the government. "Such political deception
is being carried out by irresponsible parties," he said.

So serious are the divisions at the top, however, that some in
the old guard have broken rank and publicly criticized the
current military leadership. Among them are senior retired
military leader Abdul Haris Nasution, one of the founders of
the modern armed forces, and former Home Minister Rudini. When
Rudini oh-so-gently reminded the military that it owed its
allegiance to the people, not the president, Coordinating
Minister for Politics and Security Susilo Sudarman had to
remind the retired officer of the need for unity, at least in
public.

Still, despite the heightened tensions within the ranks, and
the growing calls for a more open political system, the
military remains the dominant power in Indonesia. "It is
highly likely that the armed forces will influence the
political process in Indonesia for several decades," says Ian
MacFarling, lecturer at the Australian Defense Force Academy.

Civilians within Golkar admit that the generals will probably
thwart their plan to push Information Minister Harmoko as
vice-president. "We have to accept that the military is still
too strong," says a member of the Golkar central board. And
all other political institutions are still too weak.

The only one with any control over the generals remains
Suharto. He alone chooses who goes and who stays. The question
now is, how will Suharto shape the military, and to what ends?

Nations: Taiwan: Remaking the Opposition: The DPP"s new leader takes a
moderate tack 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Todd Crowell and Laurence Eyton Taipei

The Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's largest opposition
force, has fallen on hard times. After fighting two bruising
elections within four months, it has little to show for its
efforts. The DPP's momentum stalled in the legislature polls
last December, and its standard bearer in the island's first
popular presidential contest in March finished a very distant
second to the incumbent, Lee Teng-hui of the Kuomintang. And
if morale is low, the party's financial coffers are even
lower: last month, it could not even meet its payrolls.

DPP partisans hope these problems can be solved, given a
little time and fresh leadership. But it won't be easy to re-
animate the issues that had motivated supporters, not a few of
whom went to prison for their beliefs. Their backing made the
party Taiwan's fastest-growing political group during the
heady days of the early 1990s, when democracy was flowering
after the end of four decades of martial law. Inevitably,
perhaps, tensions and divisions have emerged within the ranks,
prompting some former stalwarts to set up their own party.

The DPP, which holds 51 of the Legislative Yuan's 164 seats,
was founded during martial-law days in the 1980s. In the early
1990s, it called boldly for Taiwan's political independence.
Party leaders also demanded more civil rights for the island's
non-mainlander majority and greater democracy for all. Now, of
course, Taiwan is just about fully democratic. An indigenous
politician occupies the presidency. So the party's ritual call
for independence is looking increasingly like something that
will bring Taiwan little benefit - and much trouble from
China.

The task of turning the DPP's fortunes around falls to Hsu
Hsin-liang, who was elected chairman in June. He replaced Shih
Ming-teh, a key member of the party's hardline pro-
independence faction. Though Hsu has a longstanding reputation
as a dissident - he started his political life with the KMT
but quit the ruling party in 1977 - and has endured exile as
well as a year in prison for his political activities, he
hails from the DPP's moderate wing. He wants to reposition the
party as a more liberal, social democratic, "caring"
alternative to the government.

But first, Hsu has to resolve the DPP's financial crisis. He
says he wants to reschedule debt, negotiate more loans and
raise more money from members. But the DPP may in fact be
banking on government funding of political groups. Hsu is
asking that all parties receive an annual subsidy of NT$100
($3.60) for every vote they won in the last election. "Right
now the situation is unfair," he says. "The KMT has all its
corporate wealth. The other parties have nothing."

Given the Kuomintang's majority - albeit a narrow one - in the
Legislative Yuan, the chances of the opposition pushing
through a political funding bill would seem slim. Yet Hsu has
some leverage. The ruling party is seeking bipartisan support
to break the gridlock that has characterized the current
legislative session. KMT secretary-general Wu Poh-hsiung
called on Hsu recently to seek the opposition chief's
cooperation in passing laws. Hsu's precondition: that his
party obtain some relief from its financial problems.

Hsu denies that he is selling DPP support in return for
passage of the political-financing measure. Rather, he says
that more cooperation, rather than confrontation, would be a
good thing at this stage. "What I want to see is something
like the National Government in Britain during World War II,
where all parties worked together in the face of a big
crisis," Hsu explains. "We have many historical problems, such
as threats from China. The KMT itself is immobilized by its
own money politics and links with gangsters. Given this, only
a coalition can carry out reforms Taiwan needs."

But Hsu's call for enhanced cooperation across the benches has
alienated some of the DPP's purists. One is its former
presidential candidate, Peng Ming-min, who has already left to
form his own Nation-Building Party, which is more aggressively
pro-independence. He and other dissenters claim that there is
little difference now between the KMT's position of
"reunification - sometime" and the Hsu-led DPP's call for
"independence - but not yet." Still, by couching the issue in
vague terms, both are probably in tune with the great majority
of Taiwan's people.

Hsu thinks that his opponents within the party may be fighting
yesterday's battles. "We can't consider the KMT a `colonial'
regime anymore after the presidential election in which Lee
Teng-hui got more than 50% of the vote. The whole political
environment has changed fundamentally, and our party has to
adjust." He hints at the prospect of putting on the back
burner the DPP's core issue - independence. If the party were
to gain power, Hsu suggests, it might not proceed with its
long-promised plebiscite on the matter, at least not
immediately.

Still, the DPP faces the difficult challenge of coming back
from the political wilderness to regain a cutting-edge
relevance among voters. In an evolving, increasingly
sophisticated Taiwan, continuing to wave the banner of
independence may not be the way to do that. Hsu is counting on
doing better with his new emphasis on a "caring society."

Nations: Thailand: A Gateway to Vietnam: Thais debate where next to bridge
the Mekong 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Nakhon Phanom is at the end of the road. A sleepy Thai border
town on the banks of the muddy Mekong river, it is a place
where opportunity is mostly elsewhere. When young people
graduate from school, they generally head to dingy employment
offices to sign up for work in Bangkok or West Asia.
Otherwise, things move slowly. On a recent afternoon, a queue
for the ferry to Laos consisted of five vehicles. One driver
had just missed the boat. No matter. He would sleep patiently
in his cab until morning.

But Nakhon Phanom won't remain the stereotypical backwater for
long, at least not if Santi Kowabootr gets his way. Four years
ago, the town's self-appointed savior cottoned on to an
inescapable fact: the city is a potential gateway to Vietnam
and, most crucially, the South China Sea port at Vinh, 338 km
away. Even back then, there was talk of upgrading the mostly
dirt road across Laos. Santi, a liquor store owner and bus
fleet operator, saw a bridge across the Mekong as the missing
link and resolved to get one built.

"Right now we can trade with Laos only," Santi says, as he
drives his car along dusty red roads to the site of the
proposed span. "There are not many people in Laos, with a
population of 4.8 million. But with a connection to north
Vietnam, we have a market of 32 million." Links are already
growing. Trade between Thailand and Vietnam in 1995 reached
about $500 million, or 0.5% of Thailand's world trade, up from
$142 million in 1991.

Fellow residents are skeptical, but Santi has one very
important reason to be optimistic: Chavalit Yongchaiyudh. The
deputy prime minister wants a bridge there too, and as a
possible contender for the top job in the next Thai
government, he may help Santi get his way. Two years ago,
Chavalit gave up his constituency outside Bangkok for Nakhon
Phanom. The populous northeast is a valuable vote bank for a
would-be premier. Since the switch, Chavalit has been currying
favor with the locals, building roads, hospitals and now - he
hopes - a bridge.

Not so fast. A hundred kilometers downstream, the town elders
of Mukdahan are lobbying hard for their own span, and they
have strong political backing too. The interest is
understandable since the stakes - and opportunities - are
huge. The Mekong is the world's 12th-longest and arguably
least developed major waterway. The river's resource-rich
basin is also home to 229 million people, a market that one
day could rival Europe.

Who will pay for the infrastructure needs in the largely
underdeveloped region? That has yet to be worked out, but
there have been some encouraging signs. Under the aegis of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), plans for some $22 billion worth
of roads, rails, dams and airports have been hatched for the
river basin. And last week, delegates from the six Mekong
nations of China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and
Vietnam met in the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming for
the latest in a string of meetings held since 1992. The
neighbors are trying hard to cooperate. Their challenge is to
find a mutually beneficial strategy to develop a complex and
fragile region that until recently was best-known for jungle
firefights and khaki commerce.

Nakhon Phanom and Mukdahan are competing to be the first
commercial hub of what the ADB calls the East-West Corridor
from Thailand through Laos to Vietnam. Four new routes are
planned along existing (and largely unpaved) roads: Routes 8,
9, 12 and 18 (see map, opposite). Once open, they will provide
major opportunities for trade between Thailand and Vietnam, as
well as give landlocked Laos access to the sea. If the more
starry-eyed planners have their way, new asphalt could one day
run clear through Myanmar, shaving hours or days off the
journey from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean.

It is easy to see why Santi is in love with the idea of a
bridge. "Developing a trade route to Vietnam is not only
important for Nakhon Phanom," he says. "It is also important
for the whole of northeast Thailand." The problem is that
Bangkok-centric politicians and business types have long
ignored Isan, as the impoverished region is known.

With prosperity around the corner, Isan residents rarely talk
about what is good for Laos - and Vientiane's aging socialists
have noticed. Only now emerging from decades of economic
isolation, Laos has been wary of opening up to foreign
influences too quickly. Sandwiched between two powerful
neighbors bent on expanding bilateral trade, the Laotians hold
some good cards, and they are no longer shying away from the
gaming table. Last month, Vientiane announced that before the
end of the year tourists and business people will be able to
obtain visas on arrival. Local residents on both sides of the
Mekong can now move relatively freely across the border. And
in an important breakthrough, Laos indicated at a recent ADB
transport forum that it was considering fully opening its
borders.

Even so, cross-river commerce promises to be complicated, at
least in the short run. Under one scenario, Thai trucks would
have to unload in Laos once they have crossed the Mekong from
Nakhon Phanom. Laotian or Vietnamese carriers would take over
from there. Impractical yes, but in theory all parties
benefit. Such an arrangement would help Laotians believe their
country was not merely a Thai highway.

Eventually, Thai and Laotian goods could be shipped from
Vietnamese ports. This would be an incalculable boon to
traders based in Nakhon Phanom. One wood exporter now sends
Laotian logs to Bangkok, then on to Singapore, where finally
they sail to the U.S. With a new road, says the firm's
expatriate manager, "We would only be faced with a short trip
to a deep-sea port in Vietnam and then we could ship direct to
the States."

The north Vietnam market - and the Laotians' demand for a
short Vientiane-to-Vietnam route - make Nakhon Phanom a strong
contender. With construction on Route 8 expected to finish
within a year, Vietnam-bound Thai goods may soon roll through
Laos. But a bridge at Nakhon Phanom is probably not on the
immediate horizon. Pramaul Khuntri, proprietor of the
optimistically named Windsor Hotel, is candidly pessimistic:
"It could take as much as five years," she says. Or longer.
After the Friendship Bridge linking the northern Thai town of
Nong Khai with Vientiane was completed in 1994, planners
turned to other potential sites, and Mukdahan, not Nakhon
Phanom, was touted as the best place to start.

Politics played a part in making the town the frontrunner. One
local MP is a Democrat and the bridge was greenlighted when
party leader Chuan Leekpai was prime minister. As well, the
Laotian finance minister hails from Savannakhet, on the Lao
side of the river. And ADB officials insist that there are
practical reasons for Mukdahan getting a bridge before its
upstream rival. "They're constantly having to dredge the river
to allow ferries to cross [at Mukdahan]," says Preben Nielsen,
an ADB economist. During the dry season, passage is even more
arduous.

Moreover, Mukdahan is fast emerging as a trading hub. Perhaps
200 trucks cross by ferry each day, and last year the town
exported some $71 million worth of goods to Laos and Vietnam.
By contrast, Nakhon Phanom exports amounted to some $24
million, and most went to Laos. On the agenda at last week's
Kunming meeting was an upgrade of Route 9, which runs through
Laos from Savannakhet (opposite Mukdahan) to link with the
Vietnamese port at Danang. Barring delays, an all-weather
Route 9 will open in 2003; the bridge in 2001.

The boosters of a span for Nakhon Phanom are hardly giving up.
One of their oft-cited arguments is that their town is 154 km
closer by road to Vietnamese ports than is Mukdahan. In
addition to Route 8, there are also plans to upgrade Route 12,
which would provide a direct link to a new Vietnamese port at
Vung Ang, south of Vinh. But the upgrade will take time. Route
12 is still a dirt track, and a hilly one at that.

A bridge at Nakhon Phanom seems inevitable - especially since
the Laotians are eager for Route 8, which would provide
Vientiane's new capitalists quick access to ports at Vinh and
Vung Ang. And Thai officials and ADB planners insist that the
question is not if, but when.

Standing at the site of the planned bridge outside Nakhon
Phanom, Santi gazes across at the verdant, unspoiled hills of
Laos. Even he finds it is hard to imagine a four-lane highway
and bridge cutting through this idyllic spot where water
buffalo currently outnumber cargo trucks. He chuckles: "If
Chavalit becomes prime minister he can build a bridge at
Nakhon Phanom tomorrow or next year. If not, maybe we won't
have a bridge for 10 years." Not surprisingly, the town has a
backup plan: more ferries. Which would mean more trucks. Even
without a bridge, Nakhon Phanom could well vault past its
rival.

Nations: Philippines: "Just and Lasting Peace": What the president wants
for Mindanao 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Fidel Ramos first met MNLF leader Nur Misuari when then-
president Corazon Aquino forged a ceasefire with the Muslim
separatists in Sulu in September 1986. At the time, Ramos was
Aquino's armed forces chief, in charge of crushing the
insurgency. Last week, Misuari signed an accord to bring an
end to the 24-year-long war. President Ramos recently talked
with Senior Correspondent Antonio Lopez about his hopes for
peace in the region. Excerpts:

What is the Southern Philippine Council for Peace and
Development?

The SPCPD is not a regional government. It is not a governing
authority. It has no lawmaking power. It has no power over
local government units. Neither will it have control over the
local police and military. The SPCPD is neither an autonomous
region nor a political subdivision of government. It is simply
a transitory administrative arm under the control and
supervision of the president. Its powers and functions are an
extension of the powers of the president.

What is your vision for Mindanao?

Our vision for Mindanao is three-fold: First, to remove from
the southern Philippines the roots of dissidence, injustice,
and inequity which gave rise to separatist movements,
rebellions and the 25-year-old condition of instability.
Second, we foresee Mindanao as a very progressive social,
economic and political component of the Philippines. Mindanao
has certain advantages in terms of its proximity to the more
progressive countries of ASEAN, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore and Brunei. The third aspect consists of bringing up
all of the people of Mindanao - Christians, Muslims, and
Lumads or indigenous people - to a level of development
already achieved by many, many Filipinos in the Visayas and in
Luzon, so that together, all Filipinos can be truly
competitive in the 21st century.

Why did you negotiate a deal with Misuari?

On day one of my administration, I called on radical
insurgents to give up their armed struggle. Our goal is a
just, comprehensive, peaceful and lasting resolution of the
internal armed conflict that has cost the nation and our
people so dearly.

What do you think of Misuari?

He is not an ordinary revolutionary. He is a man with a
statesmanlike vision to perform his mission for his people. He
has gone through the various stages of armed struggle, but now
I see him turning to a peaceful, legal, constitutional
struggle through elections. I also see him as a very deep-
thinking intellectual who is also pragmatic, in that he can
negotiate and be flexible in order to forge a solution to a
very difficult and complex problem. Lastly, I see him as a
very admirable leader. He has not veered from his cause to
bring Muslims in the Philippines a better life.

What happens to the three other separatist groups, the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front, the Islamic Command Council and the
Abu Sayyaf?

We will continue to work with the MILF with regard to a
ceasefire. Talk of a ceasefire has been going on for quite
some time. I am optimistic about these talks. The ICC and the
Abu Sayyaf are different. They first have to forgo violence
and terrorism.

Nations: Philippines: The Anatomy of a Deal: How Ramos"s government and
Muslim rebels made peace in Mindanao 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

By Tim Healy and Antonio Lopez Manila

Back in 1968, Nur Misuari was not much for niceties. The 27-
year-old student firebrand staged a nine-day protest in front
of Malaca-ang Palace demanding the ouster of then-president
Ferdinand Marcos. Not long after, he barged uninvited into
Marcos's office to seek - successfully, as it turned out - the
release from prison of an ailing Muslim rebel leader.

Last week, Misuari was back in Malaca-ang, but under
substantially different circumstances. The rebel chief of the
Moro National Liberation Front was the star at the dramatic
signing Sept. 2 of a peace accord with President Fidel Ramos's
government, ending a 24-year rebellion on the southern island
of Mindanao.

Some 120,000 people - half from the ranks of the MNLF - have
died in the secessionist struggle. The government has spent at
least $3 billion prosecuting the war. Misuari told Asiaweek:
"The first time I came to Malaca-ang was for the cause of one
man's freedom; the second time is for the cause of peace."
Replied Ramos: "Today we are all victors - triumphant over war
and violence."

Ramos and Misuari, one a West Point military man who rose to
become president, the other a former university professor and
onetime Maoist, could hardly say enough good things about each
other. Ramos's eyes moistened as Misuari asked the 1,500
guests at the signing to rise in the president's honor.
"Without your boldness and heroism, we would not have reached
this far," said the rebel to the president.

Both men have a sizable stake in the accord. Neither of
Ramos's two predecessors, Marcos or Corazon Aquino, were able
to achieve a permanent peace, despite years of effort. Ramos
had to overcome opposition from the Christian majorities in
southern Mindanao, who do not trust the MNLF or Misuari. Ramos
hopes to win them over with his economic development plans for
the region (see interview, p. 22).

For Misuari, who founded the MNLF in 1968, signing meant
settling for something short of his original goal of self-
government. During the negotiations, which began in Jakarta in
October 1993, Misuari frequently came under attack from
compatriots who said he was selling out. "I was tiptoeing on
barbed wire," he recalls.

The treaty creates a Special Zone of Peace and Development
encompassing 14 provinces and nine cities. Overseeing
development in the area will be the Southern Philippine
Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), to be headed by
Misuari or a hand-picked ally. The five-member council, which
comes under the Office of the President, will not have
lawmaking powers, but will be able to channel much-needed
development funds to the region. After three years, the member
provinces and cities will be asked to vote on a fully
autonomous government.

As part of the deal, Ramos's Lakas-NUCD party is backing
Misuari in the Sept. 9 election for governor of the Autonomous
Region for Muslim Mindanao. The ARMM comprises the four small,
mostly Muslim provinces that chose autonomy in a 1989
plebiscite.

During the three years of formal talks, Manila and the MNLF
clashed over what kind of administrative system should be
installed in southern Mindanao. Misuari originally demanded a
10-year provisional government; Manila's chief negotiator,
retired four-star Gen. Manuel Yan, offered one year. Misuari
compromised on five years and Manila came up to two. The talks
stalled at that point. Then, Libya and Indonesia intervened to
get negotiations back on track. Indonesia was especially
helpful, says Ramos. At the signing ceremony, the president
lauded the Indonesian delegation as "the best negotiators in
the world." Misuari and Yan eventually settled on a three-year
transitional council.

But what form would the council take? In 1994 and 1995, the
two sides agreed on 123 items, including how MNLF forces would
be integrated into the Philippine military. But they could not
settle on a structure for the transitional body. Misuari
objected to a plebiscite, which the Muslims could lose in the
Christian areas, but Manila insisted that the Constitution
required a vote. Talks recessed at the end of 1995.

Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas credits Ramos for the
breakthrough: "It was President Ramos's idea for the Council
for Peace and Development that broke the deadlock." The
proposal, which actually originated with Ramos's chief of
staff, Ruben Torres, was to create a non-elected government
body or regional development council, already authorized by
the Constitution.

Senior Indonesian diplomat Wiryono Sastrohandojo sold the idea
to the MNLF. Barging into a private meeting, he told the
rebels: "The SPCPD will have powers derived from the Office of
the President. It is derivative power, but power just the
same. What is important is you will have money for
development." Eventually, the MNLF agreed.

Now it is up to Misuari to make it work. Not all Muslim groups
have signed on. The foremost holdouts are the 15,000-strong
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the 500-man Abu
Sayyaf terrorist group. Misuari believes he can win over the
first: "I maintain contacts with my brothers in the MILF." And
the other? "The only problem is the Abu Sayyaf. I will try to
reach out to them to convince them to join us in this
experiment." After 24 years of bloodshed, Filipinos can only
hope that he will succeed.

Editorials: JUST DO IT: Japan should cut the excuses and legalize the pill


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

When oral contraceptives were developed in the 1960s, Japan's
government banned them, saying they had unhealthy side effects
and promoted sexual promiscuity. With the advent of the low-
dosage pill, another pretext was needed - and conveniently
found in the spread of AIDS. Legalizing the pill, of course,
might discourage the use of protective condoms. When that
argument began to wear thin, Japanese health officials
discovered another excuse in a claim by a British medical
journal that oral contraceptives might be slightly conducive
to blood clotting.

One way or another, Japan's guardians of public health and
morals have found reasons to limit the birth-control choices
of its women. As a result, Japan shares the dubious
distinction, with North Korea, of being the only countries to
proscribe the sale of oral contraceptives. Only in recent
months have there been signs that Tokyo might consider
changing course and legalizing the pill. What Japanese
authorities should do, as soon as possible, is to wind up the
endless debate - and just do it.

A key catalyst has been the appointment of a new health and
welfare minister. Unlike his predecessors, Mr. Kan Naoto seems
inclined to listen more to consumers than to special-interest
groups. That suggests change may finally be at hand. Indeed,
an ethos is emerging in Japan that citizens, rather than
bureaucrats, should be their own guardians. However,
formidable opposition remains. Some health officials seem to
have gone out of their way to undercut their minister's
reformist positions. More pertinently, powerful commercial
interests object to legalization.

Chief among them are the country's condom-makers, who
obviously want to forestall competition from the pill. With
Japan the world's top consumer of prophylactics, they ply a
lucrative trade. Aligned with them are the nation's
physicians, who think that the unrestricted sale of the pill
would cut into their highly profitable abortion practices. The
doctors, overwhelmingly male, are organized by the Japan
Medical Association. Longtime supporters of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, they exert considerable influence on the
policymaking process.

Their maneuvers have not been balanced by any strong movement
to legalize the pill by women's organizations or family
planners. In Japan, unwanted pregnancies is hardly a burning
issue. In fact, the nation worries more about its falling
birthrate, which some people think is the real, if unstated,
reason that the government has been reluctant to legalize the
pill. By some estimates, only 10% of women would choose the
pill over other methods if it were made legitimate - though
even that would be a big boost from the 1% now using it under
a legal loophole.

If there is no clamor to legalize the pill, why do it? There
are several good reasons. The unavailability of oral
contraceptives is one factor behind Japan's unusually high
abortion rate. About 350,000 women choose to abort every year,
most of them because of unwanted pregnancies rather than
economic pressures or fear of giving birth to a malformed
child. There are virtually no legal barriers to abortion and,
on the surface at least, few religious or moral strictures
either.

But abortions are cause for deep personal disquiet in Japan,
as they are anywhere else. The evidence lies in the thousands
of tiny statues to "water babies" - memorials to aborted
fetuses - that dot the nation's cemeteries. And though
abortions are performed by licensed practitioners, the surgery
is not entirely without risk. By encouraging more abortions
than would otherwise be performed, the restrictions on the
pill add unnecessarily to the health hazards facing Japanese
women.

Moreover, about 200,000 women use oral contraceptives under a
loophole that allows doctors to prescribe them as a means of
regulating menstrual disorders. Yet the only one permitted is
the old-style high-dosage, high-hormone variety. That means
the women who really are using the pill only to avoid
conception are also subjected to risks unnecessarily. Japan is
a major contributor to family planning organizations around
the world. By banning in its domestic market one of the most
commonly used methods of contraception, Tokyo lays itself open
to charges that it callously dumps pharmaceuticals in
developing countries that it considers "dangerous" at home.

Even so, the most powerful argument is that legalizing the
pill gives women additional control over their own
reproductive lives. In the three decades since the advent of
oral contraceptives, the world has had ample time to
understand that their benefits far outweigh their
disadvantages. The decision on whether to use them should rest
with individual citizens. Japanese authorities have run out of
excuses.

Editorials: JUDGING THE PAST: Nascent democracies must beware the perils of
score-settling 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Mr. Paul Bell, a South African journalist, likes to recall how
he once bumped into Rev. Desmond Tutu in a shopping mall.
Almost without thinking, he thrust his young daughter into the
bishop's arms. "Please bless my child," asked Mr. Bell. Rev.
Tutu readily complied. "I couldn't tell you why I did that,"
says Mr. Bell. "I just wanted my child to have that
beneficence bestowed on her." Actually, his instinctive
response is entirely understandable. Rev. Tutu's ethical
stature makes nearly irresistible the opportunity to receive
his blessing. The Nobel Peace Prizewinner has been chairing
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which
serves as both confessor to sinners in the nation's past
apartheid brutality as well as therapist to its victims.

Note well the touchstones of Rev. Tutu's organization: truth
and reconciliation. Then consider the recent court verdict in
South Korea, in which two former presidents, tried at the
behest of their onetime political ally, President Kim Young
Sam, were convicted of treason and manslaughter. Mr. Chun Doo
Hwan was sentenced to death, and Mr. Roh Tae Woo to more than
two decades in jail. And think about developments in
Bangladesh, where the government of Sheikh Hasina Wajed has
implicated the slain husband of the prime minister's chief
political rival after a vigorous inquiry into the 1975
assassination of her father, founding PM Mujibur Rahman. It
seems unlikely Mr. Kim or Sheikh Hasina will be asked to bless
babies anytime soon.

With the onset of democratic reform, governments around the
world are faced with the question of how to deal with unsavory
pasts. Take Eastern Europe. Shortly after Romania threw out
communism in 1989, the nation's new leaders tried, convicted
and executed Nicolae Ceausescu for crimes committed during his
24-year reign of terror. Ex-dissident Vaclav Havel chose a
gentler approach when he became president of the Czech
Republic. He advocated that those convicted of past human-
rights abuses be barred from civil service jobs.

The line between justice and vengeance can be fine indeed.
After Mrs. Corazon Aquino became president of the Philippines,
many expected Mrs. Imelda Marcos to be nailed by a probe into
the 1983 assassination of Mr. Benigno ("Ninoy") Aquino. Mrs.
Aquino had long contended that President Ferdinand Marcos and
his wife were behind her husband's dramatic murder at Manila
airport. But the rule of law prevailed. Mrs. Marcos was
cleared for lack of incriminating evidence. By accepting the
court ruling, Mrs. Aquino refuted allegations that she was
bent on a personal vendetta.

It would, of course, have been understandable if Mrs. Aquino
wanted to avenge her husband's murder. Similarly, Sheikh
Hasina's zeal to gain justice for her father - even in the
face of a constitutional provision granting pardon to the
perpetrators - might be excused in different circumstances.
But Mrs. Aquino was bound by a higher standard to allow the
Philippine judicial system to determine Mrs. Marcos's guilt or
innocence. In the same way, the Bangladesh Constitution is not
a document to be changed at the whim of an incumbent prime
minister, however personally wronged.

In the quest to determine how to deal with transgressions from
the past, a society must take the law as its starting point.
And if statutes are found inadequate or outdated, they should
be changed through legally constituted channels - but not
applied retroactively. Above all, legal justice must be
dispensed evenly, not shaped to scoop up specific victims. It
is not a tool to be used by those in power.

This will surely have occurred to President Kim. He is
constitutionally barred from seeking a second term when his
current one expires in 1998. That means he will soon be in a
similar position to Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh, before their arrests
late last year. He might hope that his successor is more than
a friend, for his own friendship with Mr. Roh counted for
little during the latter's travails. Korea may need a new
president who is willing to take on a system that condones
illegal activities such as bribe-taking, rather than simply
gunning for individual bribe-takers and ignoring the
fundamental problem. In short, the country needs someone
unlike Mr. Kim.

What would such an approach mean for the hundreds of
demonstrators killed in Kwangju 16 years ago? Should no one in
power be held accountable? Can the living forgive on behalf of
the dead? The simple answers are yes, there should be
accountability, and no, forgiveness cannot be bestowed in
absentia. If he pardons the two ex-rulers, Mr. Kim is likely
to come in for much criticism. But, for a number of important
reasons, that would be the right thing to do.

Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh have been rightly tagged with serious
wrongdoings - truths recorded for posterity. But blame for
even the worst offenses rarely rests on just one person. Who
were Mr. Chun's accomplices in the Kwangju crackdown, and to
what extent were they involved? And how many, actually, were
killed? The trial failed to shed light on these key aspects,
squandering perhaps a historic opportunity to do so. If the
government had established such truths, it would have done
much more to put the incident to rest than by staging a trial
whose outcome always seemed predetermined.

Then there are practical considerations. Pursuing truth and
justice may mean a chance to lay ghosts to rest through a
public catharsis. But what about the costs? If the United
States had not intervened in 1986 to spirit Mr. Marcos out of
Malaca-ang Palace to Hawaii, civil war could have erupted in
the Philippines. Those who wanted to hold Marcos fully
accountable for abuses under martial-law rule were denied the
opportunity to punish him accordingly. But consider the gains:
large-scale conflict was averted, the strongman was gone for
good - and a popular uprising succeeded, without shedding
blood.

In the wake of the South Korean verdict, Myanmar's ruling
junta must be wondering whether it would ever be smart to cede
power, even incrementally, to democrats without a bloody
fight. Similar thoughts must have occurred to close associates
of Indonesia's Suharto family while contemplating the
consequences if their benefactor ever lost political
authority. Vengeful score-settling only reinforces the natural
reluctance of autocrats to share power or undertake democratic
reform. And while the Kwangju survivors have no real
obligation to consider how their pursuit of justice might
affect others, it is the responsibility of elected leaders,
like Mr. Kim, to do so. Besides, every system of government
has its winners and losers. It would be inimical to a nation's
stability as well as its broader interests if new winners were
constantly to re-evaluate those they replaced, turning their
predecessors into new losers - a vicious cycle.

In the end, governments must always keep their attention
focused more on the present and the future than on the past.
Bangladesh has one of Asia's lowest per-capita GDPs and faces
such monumental challenges as feeding its people, developing
viable industries and raising literacy levels. Can it afford
to have its leaders doggedly pursuing decades-old
assassinations? In South Korea, the rampant corruption that
helped fell Mr. Chun and Mr. Roh highlighted longstanding
malpractices. The Seoul government would more productively
spend its energy and resources tackling their root causes than
pursuing further redress for past wrongs. As Rev. Tutu would
probably agree, once the truth has been established, a nation
should move on to reconciliation. Down that path lies
progress.

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

PILOT PROGRAM Cathay Pacific has flown into the future by
graduating its first woman pilot. Candy Wu Suk Fun decided she
wanted to fly the big birds when she was an engineering
student at Hong Kong University. Says the 24-year-old second
officer: "I don't see any difference between me and a man
pilot." Other Asian airlines have held a similar view for many
years. Chinese, Indian and Philippine carriers all have women
flyers. For now, Wu will be a relief pilot on long-haul
flights. She won't make captain for at least eleven years. By
then, Cathay will probably have more women pilots. Given Hong
Kong's 1997 handover to China, expect mainlanders to number
among them.

it would be devalued. Tsang, 51, told Bloomberg news agency
Soros's people have been informed that Hong Kong would
vigorously defend its currency's U.S. dollar peg: "We showed
them our bank account." It includes the Exchange Fund, holding
nearly $60 billion. That sort of money even Soros would

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

PARTY ON Three years ago, maverick MP Hatoyama Yukio, whom
many Japanese regard as a fresh, bold kind of leader, helped
form the Sakigake party to shake up local politics. While it
plays a gadfly role in the ruling coalition, Hatoyama, the
subject of an Asiaweek cover story in May, is not satisfied.
The immaculately pedigreed son of a former foreign minister
and grandson of an ex-PM is setting up a new party - yet to be
named - to re-launch his crusade against business and the
bureaucracy. Ideals - and money - keep Hatoyama, 49, going. A
multimillionaire, he is one of Japan's wealthiest politicians.
Reform may be Hatoyama's catch-cry, but to achieve it, he
cannot do without an old-style war chest.

Balance of Power Hydroelectric power is controversial. While
it is renewable and non-polluting, its dams can damage the
environment in other ways. But most countries have decided
that the pluses outweigh the minuses. They are generating
ever-greater amounts of hydroelectricity, as shown below,
measured in gigawatt-hours (1 = 1,000 megawatt-hours). Water
power is clearly driving economies and raising living
standards.

CUTTING EDGE: How to Meet a Shark and Live to Tell 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

For people who do not subscribe to the conviction that the
only good shark is a dead one, here comes the Protective
Oceanic Device (POD). It is the environmentally safe way to
avoid dangerous encounters with sharks without having to kill
them. Developed by South Africa's Natal Sharks Board, the
battery-powered POD costs a little less than $1,000 and
consists of three parts. The main section is strapped to a
diver's aqualung, the pad to one of the fins, and the control
is hand-held. The POD unit functions by generating an ultra-
mild electrical current that works against sensors in a
shark's snout which normally pick up the electrical emissions
of prey. The device creates a sort of force field around the
diver, repelling a shark from a distance of four to seven
meters. Though the POD works well for recreational divers, it
is probably more useful as a tool for researchers who want to
mingle with the beasts. It was successfully tested by two
documentary film makers swimming with sharks in tanks as well
as in the open sea. The Natal Sharks Board is working on
adapting the units for swimmers, surfboards, canoes and even
lifejackets.

Update: Justice Delayed: The year 1984 was one of great upheaval for India


from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

The year 1984 was one of great upheaval for India. The then
prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered troops into the Golden
Temple to flush out militants holed up inside Sikhdom's
holiest shrine, sparking outrage among believers worldwide. A
few months later, two of Gandhi's Sikh bodyguards gunned her
down. In retaliation, predominantly Hindu mobs slaughtered
nearly 3,000 Sikhs in Delhi alone. Now, 12 years later, 89 men
- among the last originally held for the bloodletting - have
each been sentenced to five years in jail. The defendants, out
on bail all this time, were convicted of lesser charges of
damaging property and violating curfews because of insufficent
evidence. Judge S.N. Dhingra blamed "a lack of concern by the
administration and the courts" for the long delay.

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

It is often inappropriate to compare prominent personalities
in one country to those in another, not least because
cultures, backgrounds and motivations are usually different.
But that has not stopped Lt.-Gen. Syar-wan Hamid of the
Indonesian army, still rabidly chasing "subversive elements"
for causing Jakarta's July 27 riots. Syarwan says opposition
politician Megawati Sukar-noputri fancies herself as the local
Cory Aquino, while an ally, Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid,
is Jaime Cardinal Sin, referring to two key players of the
1986 Philippine "People Power" revolution. Wahid's rebuttal:
Syarwan should take the parallels further - by naming whom the
Indonesian Marcos would be. The answer is obvious, even if the
question is perhaps unfair. But the general asked for it.

FRONTLINES: Encountering Cyberstatic 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

Recent heavy rains in Hanoi have not only caused chaos in the
streets but confusion in cyberspace as well. Subscribers of
Vietnam's only public e-mail service Netnam, managed by the
state-run Institute of Information Technology, have reported
difficulties sending and receiving international messages. The
foul weather has indeed disrupted basic services, but some
users also suspect a sinister hand at work. The alleged
culprit: the state telephone monopoly, Viet-nam Post &
Telecommunications, which has been agitating for an exclusive
license to run Internet services in the country.

Because officials have turned down VNPT's repeated requests,
some users be-lieve it is sending static down lines tapped by
Netnam subscribers. One subscriber claims oscilloscopes
connected to the lines show inexplicable signals whenever Net-
nam is accessed. Suspicions also mounted after the e-mail
provider sent a message to subscribers saying nothing appeared
to be wrong with its equipment. Netnam says it does not know
what is causing the problem, which means Vietnam's
cybercommunity will have to continue weathering the storms.
Both of them.

FRONTLINES: Democratic Bridge to Beijing? 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

As Hong Kong's transition to 1997 quickens, the thaw between
China and its local nemesis, the popular Democratic Party, is
gaining momentum. Both sides are making cautiously
conciliatory statements in public. Early last month, Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in-vited the Democrats to
participate in the Selection Committee, a 400-strong body
whose responsibility is to choose Hong Kong's first post-1997
chief executive and provisional legislature. Though their
reply was no, the Democrats said they were willing to hold a
dialogue with Beijing on other transition issues. Qian said
fine, but stressed that joining the Committee would improve
the atmosphere.

The mood is already much better. Party sources say that
preparations are already under way for two of the group's
stalwarts, chairman Martin Lee Chu Ming (pictured) and vice-
chairman Yeung Sum, to travel to Beijing in the near future.
Apparently, both sides have agreed in principle to such a
trip. Indeed, the buzz in the territory is that a ranking
member of the party has already been to the Chinese capital.

The Democrats have little problem with the Selection Committee
picking Hong Kong's future leader, but the party has long said
it will not participate in the entire process because it
considers the interim lawmaking assembly illegal. Beijing's
latest compromise proposal to the Democrats is: join the
Committee and abstain from voting on the provisional
legislature - so long as you do not openly continue to oppose
its creation. With public opinion in Hong Kong running
strongly in favor of Democratic participation in the selection
body, the party faces a tough - and potentially divisive -
decision.

ASIAWEEK: LETTERS & COMMENTS: 13 September 1996 

from ASIAWEEK, 13 September, 1996

I find your hagiographic article about 20 days in the life of
the bombastic Sri Lanka president, Chandrika Kumaratunga
["Under Seige," Cover Story, Aug. 23] somewhat disingenuous.
Her actions do not reflect her apparent high-mindedness about
human rights and justice. Her peace-through-war strategy has
caused innumerable sufferings to the Tamil civilians of the
north and east of Sri Lanka. Her willingness to gloss over
this human tragedy and to let the Sri Lankan armed forces
prosecute the war with unparalleled brutality and impunity has
only deepened the ethnic chasm in Sri Lanka.

The latest Amnesty International report on Sri Lanka slams her
government for its tolerance of continuing human rights
abuses. Perhaps, president Kumaratunga should reevaluate her
concept of human rights and justice for the sake of
alleviating the misery of thousands and thousands of innocent
Sri Lankans.

Ron Gluckman had erroneously failed to record President
Chandrika Kumaratunga's determination to restore civilian life
and rehabilitate the war-ravaged North. In June, the President
unveiled an ambitious plan to raise money from foreign
countries to restore the Jaffna region. The plan envisages the
rebuilding of roads, re-equipping of schools, creation of
farms, restoration of postal and telecommunications services,
and so forth. The plan is expected to cost about $274 million.

But equally determined are the Tamil Tigers to sabotage the
rehabilitation work  as demonstrated when a suicide bomber
killed 23 and injured 60 others including the Minister for
Construction.

Prabhakaran, Cont'd

Sachi Sri Kantha's observations [LETTERS, Aug. 16] amused me a
great deal. That Anthony Davis did "a good profile" of
Prabhakaran hinges on what was intended. Reading between the
lines, the aims and goals of transnational "Tiger Inc." are
violence, murder and sudden death. I do not think the article
would have earned the ire of the Sri Lankan government in
particular. They would have welcomed it.

Mr. Sri Kantha latches on to the statement, "Prabhakaran's
acumen is as much that of a CEO as of a military commander."
One is reminded of a GI's comment about General "Blood and
Guts" Patton: "His guts and our blood."

Mr. Sri Kantha must have a very fertile imagination to claim
that the profile of Prabhakaran differs but little from those
of George Washington, Mao, Begin and Arafat. As far as Begin
is concerned, the parallel seems correct. It would be an
insult to the others and to Nelson Mandela to associate them
with Prabhakaran.

Mr. Sri Kantha has failed to mention the true Asian
revolutionary, Ho Chi Minh, whose thesis was to "work the
socialist revolution through the nationalist aspirations" of
the people. And in Ho's lexicon, nationalism was not the
racist dogma that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has in
its lessons of indoctrination to very young students or in the
oath of hate taken at the commencement of daily parades.

How can he compare the military spending of the LTTE with that
of the Sri Lankan government? The government of Sri Lanka is a
legitimately elected government, whereas the LTTE's is, de
facto, a rogue or outlaw organization. If, as Mr. Sri Kantha
maintains, the LTTE embodies the genuine aspirations of the
Sri Lanka Tamils, why is it then that they have dungeons in
which those thought to be opponents, and those who have
refused to contribute in kind or in money under coercion, are
incarcerated and tortured? Amnesty International has
documented evidence of this as have the University Teachers
for Human Rights (Jaffna).

Mahathir for the U.N.

I would like to bring your attention to the fact that former
United Nations Secretary General U Thant of Burma was not a
cabinet minister as you mentioned. ["The Asian Factor in the
U.N. Race," FRONTLINES, Aug. 23]. He was merely a parliament
secretary in the Ministry of Information in the government of
the late U Nu, the last elected civilian prime minister of
Burma. In 1952 U Thant became a Burmese delegate to the U.N.
and five years later became the country's permanent
representative.

You also forgot to mention the most outstanding potential
candidate, one who is capable of doing the job of Secretary
General efficiently, with a proven record of building the
nation to prosperity: PM Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia.

What Comes after Having It All

I refer to "How to Know You Have It All" [NATIONS, Sept. 6].
As a Singapore citizen who had worked his guts out and came
close to karoshi [a Japanese term for sudden death from
overwork] through his 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, to eventually
attain the 5Cs [Cash or career; Credit cards, Car, Condo,
Country club membership] cleanly (no mortgage or other debt),
I wonder whether young Singaporeans are aware that what comes
after they have made the 5Cs are the 5 Ds: Decay (hair and
teeth), Disability (worsening myopia, arthritis, etc.),
Disease (clogging of arteries, cancer, gout), Depression
(boredom from not working) and finally Death.

There is more. When you have finally attained the last D, you
have a choice of the 3Es: `Eaven (heaven), `Ell (hell) or
Extinction (if you do not believe in the first two Es).

CORRECTION  Our story "The Billionaires' Binge" [BUSINESS,
Aug. 23] mistakenly said that Singapore's Fraser and Neave has
Coca-Cola bottling franchises in Myanmar, among other
Southeast Asian countries. Though F&N Coca-Cola has soft drink
operations in eight Asian countries in all, Myanmar is not one
of them. Furthermore, the company has no current plans to
enter the country. Asiaweek regrets the error.
