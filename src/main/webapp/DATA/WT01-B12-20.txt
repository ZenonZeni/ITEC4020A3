 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COMPREHENSIVE </H2>

<P>  TVM-49 is one of the most comprehensive, nutritional supplements ever formulated.  It is the Life Plus basic, nutritional insurance policy for adults and older children. No other product in its category begins to compare with it when you consider the quality and quantity of ingredients, its broad spectrum base and cost per unit of nutrients.</P>
<P>  The body requires a good balance of a wide variety of nutrients as more than one nutrient is usually involved in each individual biochemical reaction in the body. If even one of those nutrients is lacking, the natural health supporting chain reaction cannot take place. If such a lack persists, the body will eventually suffer some form of degeneration or disease.</P>
<P>  TVM-49 is a unique, broad spectrum nutritional supplement TVM-49 ensures the necessary nutrients classified as present in a rational relationship and with numerous synergistic associated nutrients, including many ultra-trace elements, so they can work together harmoniously.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BE SURE WITH TVM-49</H2>
<P>  TVM-49 goes far beyond just vitamins and minerals. It is manufactured by strictly controlled cold processing methods and contains many "super foods" such as Lecithin, Bee Pollen, Kelp and Bioflavonoids. These "super foods" contain many nutritional factors, presently unknown, which could be very essential to good health. The Life Plus proprietary PhytoZyme tablet base contains over thirty natural phytochemical plant concentrates from foods such as broccoli, carrot, cauliflower and several others. TVM-49 also contains the valuable special amino acids L-Glutamic Acid, L-Glutamine and L-Tyrosine, known not just for their traditional value, but for their more newly understood value against brain aging.
  TVM-49 contains numerous trace and ultra-trace minerals such as Chromium, Selenium, Vanadium (as Vanadyl Sulfate), Molybdenum, Germanium, Silicon and Boron, most of which are not contained in other multi-vitamin and mineral products on the market today.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT ABOUT IRON?</H2>
<P>  Iron is intentionally not included in this great formula as it is becoming more apparent that only a small number of people need iron supplements.  Men, in particular, usually do not need iron but some women do. It is believed that the reason some diseases, particularly heart disease and cancer, are more prevalent in men is that they do not routinely lose some of their iron through menstruation as women do. It is now known that excess iron can be responsible, or at least involved, in the production of damaging free radicals in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHAT ABOUT MEGA VITAMINS?</H2>
<P>  At Life Plus, we do not believe in taking large amounts of all the vitamins and minerals routinely on a daily basis. At times, the use of larger amounts of certain nutrients, such as Vitamin A, C or E may be worthwhile. You may want to use larger amounts of certain amino acids or enzymes.   TVM-49 supplies you with a substantial amount of about every nutrient the average person needs daily.  Four tablets a day will give you 100% of the RDA of everything except calcium and magnesium. TVM-49 contains calcium and magnesium, but due to their sheer bulk, six tablets are required to obtain the full RDA quantities.</P>
<P>  Our bodies are simply fantastic! If we furnish them with adequate amounts of the required nutrients, combined with a reasonable lifestyle, they maintain themselves against the various toxicants they are exposed to   each   day. Because our foods do not contain the quantities of nutrients they did in the past, and because we are exposed to more pollutants in our environment, in the foods we eat and the water we drink, it only makes sense to supplement daily with TVM-49.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  TVM-49 is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE TVM-49 </H2>
<P>It is recommended that children over twelve years of age and adults take four tablets each day, usually two tablets with breakfast and two with the evening meal for the nutritional insurance you need.  You may add to your program as desired with such products as <A HREF="mcalmag.htm">CALMAG
PLUS</A>,  <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS</A>, <A HREF="mmagicm.htm">INNER MAGIC M</A> or <A HREF="mmagicf.htm">INNER MAGIC F</A> depending on your needs.
