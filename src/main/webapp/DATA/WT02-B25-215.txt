<P><IMG SRC="BULLET2.GIF" HEIGHT=9 WIDTH=9><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">There
are hundreds of thousands of people with mental illness in the state of
Illinois who must cope with declining health, anguish, frustration, loss
of self esteem, loss of friends and family.</FONT></B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="BULLET2.GIF" HEIGHT=9 WIDTH=9><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Mental
Health services in Illinois are under-funded and over-worked. We live in
a state where per capita government expenditures sink to 37th in the nation.</FONT></B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="BULLET2.GIF" HEIGHT=9 WIDTH=9><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">We're
discriminated against by insurance companies who put unfair caps on our
medical benefits, and won't give mental illnesses the benefits of regular
medical coverage.</FONT></B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="BULLET2.GIF" HEIGHT=9 WIDTH=9><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">We
live in a society where, according to reliable studies, 40% of the population
thinks it's okay to discriminate against a mentally ill person in housing
and in employment.</FONT></B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="BULLET2.GIF" HEIGHT=9 WIDTH=9><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">And
worse, we're humiliated by media that stigmatize and misrepresent mental
illness, and by news and entertainment industries which exploit the mentally
ill.</FONT></B></P>

<H2><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">What can we do?</FONT></I></B></H2>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">There are some of us consumers who are working
for our rights: the rights of the mentally ill to live decently and with
dignity.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">We, the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of the
state of Illinois, have nearly 40 grassroots affiliates which you can join,
under the umbrella of the state organization, AMI-Illinois. AMI offers
opportunities for consumers to partake in virtually every niche of the
organization, from state office holder to local committees to support networks.</FONT></B></P>

<H4><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">AMI can make a difference for the mentally
ill. Often the word used is empowerment. Under the auspices of AMI, consumers
gain a foothold in their own futures: economically, politically, organizationally,
legally and in healthcare.</FONT></B></H4>

<H2><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">Here are some activities which Illinois'
consumers have done through AMI:</FONT></I></B></H2>

<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">helped organize and worked for a national
campaign against stigma</FONT></B></LI>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">made public addresses to schools, churches,
multi-national businesses</FONT></B></LI>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">testified before state senate committees</FONT></B></LI>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">spoken at national conventions</FONT></B></LI>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">sat on the AMI-Illinois board, executive committee,
and numerous local boards and committees</FONT></B></LI>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">developed a nationally recognized consumer
support network.</FONT></B></LI>
</UL>

<H2><B><I><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">Are We Welcome?</FONT></I></B></H2>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">You bet! AMI groups, at the national, state
and local level, want consumer members: they're begging for consumer membership.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The long-term goals of AMI-IL read, &quot;We
need to look for ways to make it easier for primary consumers to belong!
...We will be stronger, and a more credible voice if we build a larger
consumer membership.&quot;:</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">We have a Consumer Council, made up of recovering
mentally ill people, which has a special advisory capacity to the state
board. When they want to know about a situation which affects consumers,
they ask us.</FONT></B></P>
