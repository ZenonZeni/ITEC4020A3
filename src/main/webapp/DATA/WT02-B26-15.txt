<H2>GAINS: For People With Co-Occurring Disorders In The Justice System</H2>
<hr>


	The National GAINS Center for People with Co-occurring Disorders in the Justice System was established in September 1995 and is a national locus for the collection and dissemination of information about effective mental health and substance abuse services for people with co-occurring disorders who come into contact with criminal justice systems.  The Center is jointly funded by the Center for Mental Health Services, the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, and the National Institute of Corrections.
<P>
	GAINS Center staff and consultants will collect information designed to influence the range and scope of mental health and substance abuse services provided in jails, prisons, and community corrections; tailor these materials to the specific needs of localities; and help localities plan, implement, and operate appropriate, cost-effective programs.
<P>
	Additionally, GAINS Center staff will collaborate with national experts, policy-makers, practitioners, researchers, consumers, and family members from the mental health, substance abuse, and criminal justice fields.  They will use the information they assemble to create innovative programs, provide technical assistance, convene interagency groups, develop a bibliographic database, and generate policy statements on key issues affecting the treatment and management of people with co-occurring disorders in the justice system.
<P>
	Inadequate, fragmented community services increase the likelihood that people with co-occurring disorders will be arrested and unnecessarily confined.  A lack of knowledge about mental illness and substance abuse disorders on the part of police, courts, and corrections staff means that people with co-occurring disorders may receive few, in any, services within the justice system, or they may be forced to accept treatment that is inappropriate for their needs.  And without appropriate treatment, the individual's symptoms may worsen.  To address these issues, the GAINS Center will help localities design, implement, and operate integrated systems of services for the treatment and management of individuals in the justice system.
<P>
	Note:  For more information about the GAINS Center, call 1-800-311-GAIN.
