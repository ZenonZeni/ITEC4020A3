Abstract: The effect of using run-around heat exchanger systems
on energy use and the energy life-cycle cost of a typical large
office building has been investigated. The run-around heat exchanger
system was used for both preheating and pre-cooling the supply
ventilation outdoor air. The performance of the building using
run-around systems was studied using the DIE-2.1D program. In
order to simulate both the building systems and the run-around
systems, an existing computer program that can accurately simulate
a run-around system was incorporated into DOE92.1. An investigation
was also conducted to determine the maximum outdoor air ventilation
rate a run-around heat exchanger system allows without any increase
in energy use (or energy cost) for the building. The simulations
were conducted for Chicago, Denver, Edmonton and Fort Worth. The
results show that, compared to the energy performance of the building
without the run-around systems, the use of run-around heat exchangers
systems in the office building can reduce annual electrical energy
consumption, natural gas consumption, and total energy costs by
up to 3.5%, 40.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Boiler and chiller sizes
can be reduced by up to 32.6% and 8%, respectively. It was also
found that, through the use of run-around systems, the ventilation
rate into the building can be increased by several hundred percent
compared to 62-1989, without increasing energy costs.

Abstract: Microorganisms are well protected by the moisture surrounding
them if the relative humidity is above 70%. They can cause many
acute diseases, infections, and allergies. Humidity also has an
effect on air cleanliness and causes the building structure and
its contents to deteriorate. Therefore, controlling humidity is
a very important factor to human health and comfort and the structural
longevity of a building. To date, a great deal of research has
been done, and is continuing, in the use of both solid and liquid
desiccants. This paper introduces a desiccant-assisted system
that combines dehumidification and mechanical refrigeration by
means of a desiccant pre-conditioning module that can serve two
or more conventional air-conditioning units. It will be demonstrated
that the proposed system, also having indirect evaporative cooling
within the preconditioning module, can reduce energy consumption
and provide significant cost savings, independent humidity and
temperature control, and therefore, improved indoor air quality
and enhanced occupant comfort.

Abstract: Heat recovery in ventilation systems with humidification
of the exhaust air. Normally used heat recovery systems (cross
flow plate heat exchangers, heat pipes and rotating regeneration)
need a lot of space in the central plant. Tighter and more energy
effective are water loop systems with two heat exchangers in the
outdoor air and the exhaust air with a water circulation pipe.
Old plants can also be changed over to this system easily.

Abstract: Results are reported from a detailed parametric study
to evaluate the performance of a newly proposed hybrid solar housing
development in Monymusk, Scotland. The development embodies solar
collectors forming part of the roof structure itself and indistinguishable
in appearance from the local vernacular, a new optimised solar
roof collector system which combines both heating and ventilation
functions and the ability to automatically switch between a range
of heating and/or ventilation modes. Each dwelling unit was modelled
using degree-day properties, and the thermal performance was simulated
over a period of one year, based on expected occupancy and usage,
and using meteorological data appropriate to the geographical
location. It is concluded that with careful construction, good
thermal insulation, moderate thermal mass and properly controlled
ventilation, the collector system can meet the space and domestic
hot water heating requirements almost entirely. The annual total
heating bill, with full price electricity, could be less than
50 per dwelling at 1994 prices.

methods for the determination of air flow rates for dwellings.
A first draft standard has been prepared and is currently under
revision by the working group and experts of the national CEN
shadow committees. Since the draft with its annexes is rather
comprehensive, this article summarizes only roughly the basic
assumptions and the methods developed so far, without giving the
definitions and equations in detail. For this, the reader is referred

Abstract: It has been estimated in the Energy Conservation in
Buildings and Community Systems Strategy Plan (IEA, 1994c) that
about one quarter of all energy is consumed in dwellings within
the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. Also, in dwellings, within the Air Infiltration and
Ventilation Centre's member countries, the energy used for space
heating and cooling accounts for between 60% - 70% of the total
energy consumed. Furthermore, it is predicted (IEA, 1994c) that
ventilation and air movement is expected to become the dominant
heat and cooling loss mechanism in buildings of the next century.
As part of its programme of work, the AIVC has co-ordinated attempts
to quantify the part of delivered energy that is specifically
associated with infiltration and ventilation of buildings. This
has been achieved by means of a workshop, a survey and a conference.
The purpose of this paper is to present estimates of the current
situation for dwellings. The calculations given here have been
performed for each of the member countries. This article expresses
the energy impact in terms of both delivered energy and the consequent
carbon dioxide production. For some countries the air change-related
energy data have been found from published sources, and in other
cases, a nominated representative, from a particular country has
estimated the situation, or has approved such an estimation.

in office buildings depends on the reduction of these sources
and not on an increase of ventilation rates.

Abstract: The IEA Energy Technology Collaboration Programme provides
a cost effective mechanism, the Implementing Agreement, for Member
countries to work together on the development of new energy technologies
and their introduction into the market. The Programme has changed
as energy technology objectives have changed. The range of projects
has increased; companies are more extensively involved; and there
is more emphasis on environmental aspects of energy issues. Participation
by non-Member countries is encouraged. This publication explains
the benefits of collaborating on energy technology projects through
the IEA and demonstrates the relevance of the Programme to the
current energy policy objectives of Member and non-Member countries.
It describes how the Programme operates. It details all the current
projects, which include energy technology information centres
and research and development projects in the fields of fossil
fuels, renewable energy, efficient end-use technologies and nuclear
fusion. The achievements of these projects are set out. These
projects and their benefits deserve to be more widely known and
that is the purpose of this publication. Technology collaboration
through the IEA is proving increasingly attractive as a means
for countries to gain a better return from their energy technology
budgets.

have been kept to a minimum, while emphasis is placed on describing
ventilation and the decision making involved in selecting and
planning for ventilation. By understanding this Guide, it is hoped
that the reader will be able to make fundamental judgments about
how much ventilation should be provided and how this should be

on the BRES 3 TC lumped parameter simulation method. Rooms are
modelled as networks of thermal conductance and capacitance. The
tool can be used to calculate the maximum comfort temperature
during a building's occupied period. It produces outputs in three
formats: maximum comfort temperatures; daily temperature variations;
parametric variation graphs, which allow the user to explore the
effect of such variables as night ventilation rate, ceiling mass,

Abstract: Based on hour-by-hour simulation studies, this paper
presents the annual energy consumption characteristics of water-panel
type cooled-ceiling systems in comparison with conventional all-air
systems. In particular, some unique energy saving measures associated
with cooled-ceiling systems are numerically studied. The results
indicate that a cooled-ceiling system can save much of the fan
energy required in all-air systems, and that in the temperate
Dutch climate, the system has a compatible energy performance
with a VAV (variable air volume) system for office-building cooling
purposes. the energy saving possibilities studies include using
ceiling water to pre- or re-heat ventilation air and using a cooling
tower for free cooling. The paper also demonstrates the possibilities
of using a simulation technique to estimate non-conventional energy
efficient system designs.

is pointed out here that the individual variation can be very

Abstract: In a displacement ventilated room the air flow pattern
is mainly governed by the convection flows from the different
heat sources. The interaction of the convection flows influences
the contamination distribution in the room. The distribution also
depends on the position and strength of the contamination sources.
Local values at the same height in the room may differ significantly.
The distribution is also sensitive to 'disturbances' in the form
of e.g. persons moving around. The factors governing the air flow
patterns were investigated by measurements of temperature gradients,
convection flow rates in plumes and contamination distributions.
The efficiency of the ventilation was measured for many different
combinations of ventilation flow rates, heat loads and contamination
sources. The temperature gradient was strongly correlated to the
ventilation flow rate and very stable. People moving around or
walking in and out of the room did not influence the shape of
the gradient. Models for the temperature gradient in balanced
and unbalanced conditions were developed. The convection flow
rate in a plume and its maximum height were influenced by the
temperature gradient. Models for the convection flow rate in a
plume from a point or a line source are given including the height
where the plumes disintegrate due to the gradient in the surroundings.
The air change efficiency increased with the ventilation flow
rate as long as the convection plumes reached the ceiling, and
decreased when the plume disintegrated below the ceiling. The
contaminant removal effectiveness was dependent on the position
of the contamination (tracer gas) source and on the interaction
of the convection flows in the room. A small change in the position
of the tracer gas source caused a great change in the contaminant
removal effectiveness. The interaction of the different convection
flows in the room also caused a great variation in the local air
quality indices measured at the same level at different positions
both with the tracer gas source in a plume and outside a plume.
When the tracer gas source was outside a plume a heavy tracer
gas spread to the floor in all measured cases while a light tracer
gas spread to the floor only at low temperature gradients independent
of the ventilation flow rate. Opening and closing of a door was
enough to destroy a stratification of contaminants with the tracer
gas source outside a plume. The local air quality indices measured
in the room with a person moving around or close to a person standing
still approached those for mixing ventilation and in some cases
even lower values were measured with the source outside a plume.
With the tracer gas source in a plume the local air quality indices
measured close to a person in all cases were higher than the values
measured at the same level in the surroundings. When monitoring
the local air quality index close to the nose of a person walking
around or sitting still much higher values than in the surroundings
were measured.

Abstract: This paper examinesaon alternative strategy for heating,
cooling, and ventilating buildings that attempts to combine the
best features of both natural and mechanical systems. It involves
a holistic approach to design that treats the building and engineering
equally. Such climate-responsive integrated building/engineering
systems are intended to operate in the natural mode whenever possible
to minimize energy use and only use mechanical systems under peak
conditions at the extremes of external temperatures. The period
of use of natural systems can be extended by using passive cooling
techniques and fabric thermal storage. Some of the building mass,
walls, ceiling slabs etc, are used as thermal storage media and
are allowed to cool overnight and absorb heat the next day. The
technique requires some automated control of natural ventilation
but both reduces energy use and, by virtue of the thermal mass
involved, limits the rise in internal temperature on occasions
when normal design criteria are exceeded. The paper described
the philosophy and operation of mixed-mode systems used in conjunction
with fabric thermal storage and suggests some guidelines for the
development of the design of a practical system.

Abstract: Ventilation of the building fabric is one method to
achieve storage of heat and cold. A popular European method is
to pass air through ducts within the floor and ceiling slabs.
That air can either be at the outside air temperature or from
the air-conditioning plant. In the former case, the intention
is to transfer cold from night to day and in the latter to reduce
peak loads by cooling the room surfaces and thus increase comfort
via radiant cooling. The performance of such systems can be assessed
by comparison with direct nighttime ventilation (say, through
windows) and traditional air-conditioning systems operating during
occupancy. The paper presents the development of a numerical model
of a ventilated floor slab for use in a dynamic thermal model
and the application of that model to a current design project.
Energy consumption cannot be ignored; however, a complete analysis
of the implication of storage systems would be a major paper.
This paper therefore considers the main energy implications associated
with slab storage systems.

Abstract: There is currently an upsurge of interest in the application
of buoyancy-driven displacement ventilation systems and chilled
ceiling devices in the office environment within the UK's heating,
ventilation and air conditioning industry. As part of a series
of research projects in the field of displacement ventilation,
the BSRIA has undertaken a programme of work to investigate whether
it is feasible to combine displacement ventilation systems and
chilled ceiling devices while still maintaining adequate levels
of thermal comfort and a predominant upward air movement. These
studies were achieved by using both physical measurements and
numerical modelling based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
techniques. When displacement ventilation without cooled ceilings
was considered, the airflow patterns were chiefly upward when
the internal thermal loads were equivalent to the cooling capacity
of the displacement ventilation system. On condition that the
supply air temperature and air velocity were maintained within
the recommended values, a high order of thermal comfort and air
quality were predicted. The addition of chilled beam devices to
offset higher internal thermal gains progressively eroded the
predominant upward air flow region as thermal loads were increased.
Indeed when the cooling load of the chilled ceiling devices was
about three times that of the displacement ventilation system,
the flow field was virtually similar to a conventional mixed airflow
system, except in the vicinity of heat sources where upward convective
plumes entrain air from the displacement cool air layer at floor
level. The simulation of displacement ventilation with chilled
panels, however, showed that the radiant cold panels slightly
increased the depth of the mixed warm and contaminated upper region,
but it did not affect the displacement airflow characteristics
of the lower part of the room. The environmental thermal comfort
conditions, however, were of a very high order in all cases considered.

Abstract: The subject of this paper is the computational determination
of the air diffusion performance index (ADPI) of a cold air jet
in an enclosure. The jet outlet size, temperature, momentum and
Archimedes number were varied to produce a range of attached and
separate flow regimes. The cooling load was produced by heating
one of the room walls. The effect of using conventional and cold
supply jets was investigated for two heat source locations. The
results indicate that, for the type of diffuser and room configuration
studied, an optimum ADPI was obtained when the jet separation
distance is approximately equal to the room characteristic length.
Room airflow, conditions produced by conventional and cold air
supply temperature air are almost identical to each other when
the same separation distance criteria, ie. same momentum flux,
are used.

Abstract: When designing comfortable workspaces, traditional design
criteria such as dry-bulb temperature and operative temperature
are not always sufficient. Using the predicted mean vote (PMV)
as the design parameter, it becomes evident as to what system
should be used to condition the space. The projects described
in this paper show that the mean radiant temperature (MRT) has
a large influence on the comfort results. Therefore, the application
of radiant heating and cooling panels would prove an optimal solution
to the conditioning of the space within comfort limits (PMV+/-0.5).

Abstract: Active control of the storage mass of an office building
in Horgen, Switzerland, by means of a water-carrying pipe system
installed in the core of the concrete ceilings has already proven
successful over a period of three summers. Comfort measurements
in practice and under load-simulated operating conditions have
confirmed the suitability of the system for small and medium loads.
During the day, only the supply air volume of the mechanical ventilation
system is cooled to a temperature of 19 degree C (66.2 degrees
F); the heat stored in the concrete mass is discharged overnight.
However, the proportion of cooling water generated in the free-cooling
mode remained below expectations. This is attributable to the
clearly lower inner thermal loads and the facade insulation which
is no longer up-to-date. Since the building already dispenses
a part of its heat via the facade on cooler summer nights, the
utilization efficiency of the free concrete core-cooling system
diminishes somewhat in importance. The experience gained, however,
is recommendation enough for the employment of the embedded pipework
system, not only for the cooling but also for the heating of well-insulated
buildings with small and medium cooling loads.

Abstract: Indirect evaporative cooling (IDEC) is a proven technology
that can reduce mechanical cooling demand and energy requirements.
Various concepts are available in predesigned configurations for
incorporation with packaged or semi-custom manufactured heating,
ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) equipment. Application
of indirect evaporative cooling in large built-up HVAC systems
is often not considered, thereby missing the opportunity for significant
savings potential. This paper discusses four concepts that have
been successfully applied in large systems and the associated
cooling and energy savings and is an overview of previously published
work (see bibliography). These savings can provide a significant
contribution toward meeting the proposed Tier 1 energy savings
requirement of ASHRAE Standard 90.1-1989R.

Abstract: Proceedings of a workshop organised as part of the UK
contribution to the Future Buildings Forum, which was officially
started in June 1991 under the 'Energy Conservation in Buildings
and Community Systems Programme' of the International Energy Agency.
Its aim is to contribute to a sustainable society by means of
enriching international building energy research with topics which
will be of importance during the next century. The FBF tries to
investigate the future situation which will influence the needs
of our building stock. It will address energy, environmental,
economic and technical issues. The 'Innovative Cooling Workshop'
is the first workshop in a programme of six, which have the aim
to identify and study energy, environmental, economic, and technological
issues that will affect the building industry by the year 2025
and beyond; to define research priorities to resolve these issues
in and outside the building industry; and to monitor and disseminate
technological advances affecting the state of the future in building
technology; to positively influence the efficient conception,
design, construction, renovation and operation of buildings.

Abstract: The cooling load calculations according to VD1 1078
and the building simulation program TRNSYS delivers reasonable
results. By using an approximation method the transient functions
are derived, which show good conformity with the described method
and which can be used for all types of constructions. To describe
the humidity dynamics further investigations are necessary.

Abstract: If the cooling capacity is introduced into a room above
the heating sources, mainly in rooms with mixed flow, certain
air velocities not being able to be kept within will be found
in the room even if the outlets are adjusted optimally. This knowledge
existed already earlier. Experiments with cooled ceilings show
now that these velocities depend only on the cooling capacity
related to the floor area for a given geometry. The experimental
results also give hints to which area the capacity has to be related.
The good agreement with the known velocities in mixed flows encourages
to extend the results of cooled ceilings to mixed flow.
