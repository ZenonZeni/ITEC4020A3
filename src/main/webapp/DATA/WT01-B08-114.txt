<FONT SIZE=+1><B><P>Okay, we admit it- we've committed one of the Cardinal Sins of web site
management- not updating our site nearly often enough! You can still go to
the order page and see our June special, our contest supposedly ended weeks
ago, and our info page about the company has listed several items as
"Coming Soon" for many moons!<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="REMEDY.gif"></CENTER>

<P>One reason for delays is that we're a gardening company, and spring, summer
and fall are busy times for us. Now that winter is almost here, things are
slowing down enough to allow for some maintenance and upgrading.
Some of the improvements in the works:<P>
<P>*Dirt Doctor. Ask the Dirt Doctor has been working wonderfully- we're
getting questions from all over the country, and even as far away as
Australia!  Needless to say, it's a lot of mail for one person to answer,
so we're enlisting some help:  Experts from several locations in the
country, each of whom can give excellent advice related to their locale.
Nothing is going to look different, but people should get responses to
their questions much more quickly than in the last couple of months.</P>
<p>*Finishing up those "Coming Soon" areas. We've got some cool stuff coming:
(1.) A company photo-album/scrapbook, that will tell the history of who we
are and show you who makes this company tick; (2.) A detailed, functional
listing of stores where Whitney Farms products are sold. Can we POSSIBLY
list every single location? We're sure as heck going to try!</P>
*Something seasonal- A Christmas Special on T-shirts! Our t-shirts have
been a big hit, and we're getting a new batch printed just in time for the
Christmas season!</p>
