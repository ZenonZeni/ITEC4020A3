The workforce
</H1>

Victoria's workforce is highly skilled and educated. It is particularly suited 
to working in the modern industrial environment which demands international 
best practice from all companies.
<P>
<B><I>Wage setting and industrial relations</B></I>
<P>
The overall aim of the Victorian Government is to create an industrial 
relations environment in which company managements are able to negotiate 
effectively with employees and their representatives to establish wages 
and other conditions of employment conducive to high level productive 
performance by enterprises. 
<P>
This positive employer-employee relations 
environment is being enhanced by the rapid transition, now well underway, 
from a centralised arbitration-based system to an enterprise bargaining 
system under which management and employees in individual enterprises negotiate 
directly on wages and conditions having full regard for the performance 
and prospects for their business. This transition is supported by direct State 
legislation (the Employee Relations Act 1992) and by moves by the Commonwealth 
Government to make direct bargaining at enterprise level under
Commonwealth legislation more widely accessible.
<P>
As well as individual employers, major representative groups including 
employer organisations and peak union bodies support the continued expansion 
of enterprise bargaining.
<P>
The emergence of enterprise bargaining has been accompanied by, and 
facilitated major improvements to, work practices in increasing numbers of 
companies. In recent years, employers, employees and their representative 
organisations have been working towards improvements in award 
structures and work practices to increase labour productivity and the 
quality of the goods and services produced.
<P>
These changes are taking place at industry and enterprise levels, and 
involve changes to working hours and payment systems, greater leave 
flexibility, new job classifications, multiskilling, and clearer links 
between training, skills and wages, leading to the creation of new 
career paths. The changes are directly aimed at improving productivity and 
efficiency to meet best practice standards. 
<P>
In those areas where there is 
significant union representation (comprising about 30% of the private sector 
workforce), there are now fewer unions involved in representing workers at 
particular workplaces. Unions are increasingly organised on an industry and 
enterprise basis rather than occupationally. The enterprise bargaining 
initiatives now spreading more widely throughout the workforce will provide 
greater impetus for stability in employer-employee relations. 
<P>
The system of 
compulsory arbitration in Australia administered by industrial tribunals, 
such as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, focuses on 
dispute resolution.
<P>
This system is now playing a lesser role for larger numbers of companies, as, 
increasingly, wages and working conditions are resolved at individual 
enterprise level. It continues, however, to have significance in setting 
wages and conditions in a variety of industries. 
<P>
In Victoria, wages and conditions that are agreed under Victorian State law 
are established under individual or collective employment agreements made 
between the employer and the employee (or his/her representative). These 
employment agreements provide for the parties to negotiate freely to establish 
an agreement that reflects the circumstances and requirements of the 
particular workplace. 
<P>
Investors who are seeking to establish new business are able to do so in a still 
evolving but positive environment which is conducive to the maintenance of 
harmonious employer-employee relations.
