<html><hr><head><h2>Secretary of Energy Testifies Before Congress <br>on Senate Bill
  S. 1271</h2></head>
<p><hr>
    <body><h4>
  Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary appeared before the
  Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on December
  14, 1995, to testify that the Administration would not
  support Senate Bill S. 1271, which, among other provisions,
  directs siting of an interim storage facility in Nevada. 
  <p>
  The bill's provisions mandate expediting the construction of
  an interim storage facility for commercial spent nuclear
  fuel, beginning operations in phases by January 1998. The
  facility would be constructed at the Nevada test site in
  area 25, which is located near the Yucca Mountain site.
  Secretary O'Leary stated that the Administration is
  concerned that the siting of an interim storage facility in
  Nevada, and at an unreasonably rapid pace, would force the
  Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM)
  program into excessively curtailed regulatory processes and
  unreasonable and logistically untenable deadlines. Secretary
  O'Leary pointed out that the national policy, expressed in
  existing law, is that Nevada should be excluded from
  consideration as an interim storage site. "The selection of
  any site for an interim storage facility," she said,
  "deserves to be based upon objective analysis using
  substantive criteria...the relative merits of selecting
  Nevada as an interim storage site would certainly be
  influenced by the probability that the repository will also
  go forward. That probability cannot be evaluated at this
  time."

  Secretary O'Leary expressed concern that the approach
  adopted in the proposed bill for resolving the interim
  storage need is likely to raise new issues for equally
  important aspects of the national nuclear waste system. "The
  bill as drafted," stated Secretary O'Leary, "assigns
  priority to an immediate initiative on interim storage with
  a highly accelerated schedule. This requirement coupled with
  the probable budget constraints would place the repository
  program in jeopardy and reduce the policy commitment to the
  long-term strategy of geologic disposal." She stated that
  geologic disposal is the end-point of the Federal
  radioactive waste management system, and that a decision to
  significantly defer or abandon it would have the effect of
  making at-reactor or interim storage of commercial spent
  nuclear fuel the open-ended, long-term strategy. "Unless the
  importance of geologic disposal is reflected in the
  articulation of public policy and in the funding of the
  program," testified Secretary O'Leary, "we will need to
  rethink our options for the long-term custody of all
  high-level nuclear waste."
 <p> 
  S. 1271 provides for the continuation of site
  characterization activities at Yucca Mountain and for the
  licensing and development of a repository if the site is
  found suitable. In the event of constrained funding,
  however, the licensing, construction, and operation of the
  repository are designated to have a lower priority than the
  interim storage facility and its associated transportation
  system. "Because the measure does not change the budgetary
  treatment of the Nuclear Waste Fund collections," stated
  Secretary O'Leary, " it seems likely that the funding for
  the repository determination will be constrained as the
  requirements of an interim storage initiative increase." 
  <p>
  In discussing her proposed course of action, Secretary
  O'Leary stated that the Administration continues to believe
  that completion of the scientific studies at Yucca Mountain
  is the most sensible and principled course of action. "If
  Yucca Mountain is found suitable and meets the test of 
  licensing," commented Secretary O'Leary, "provision could
  have been made to take waste at the site in a receiving
  facility as early as 2004. The fiscal year 1996 budget
  submitted by the Administration would have supported this
  approach. However, funding constraints imposed by the fiscal
  year 1996 appropriations appear to have foreclosed this
  schedule." 
  <p>
  Faced with current realities, Secretary O'Leary proposed
  five principles to be adopted into legislation that would
  maintain momentum  toward permanent disposal, address the
  interim storage issue, and recognize the realities of the
  budget outlook. These five principles are: 
  <p>
<ul>
<li>Providing adequate funding to resolve the major remaining technical uncertainties at Yucca Mountain
<li>Revising the repository regulatory structure to reflect current circumstances
<li>Selecting any interim storage site based on objective criteria
<li>Initiating generic interim storage activities
<li>Protecting the environment and assuring public and worker health and safety.
</ul><p>
  Secretary O'Leary concluded her testimony by noting the past
  year's accomplishments made by OCRWM, including the adoption
  of a new program approach and the measurable progress that
  was made toward geologic disposal at the Yucca Mountain
  site.
