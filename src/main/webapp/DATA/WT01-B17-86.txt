DAVID M. KOFFMAN, D.C., F.I.C.S., on 
<EM>Chiropractic and Back Pain</EM></CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> <I>Can chiropractic treat other problems besides back pain?</I>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Most definitely as this patient story shows. These &quot;other
problems&quot; are frequently connected with the back problem
in the first place. Mary, age 45, came to me complaining about
lower back pain. She was constipated and had been diagnosed with
irritable bowel syndrome; she would fluctuate between constipation
and diarrhea. 
<P>
She had bad frontal headaches every day. It was not unusual for
her to wake up with a headache. She also had low blood sugar,
or hypoglycemia, plus knee, neck, and shoulder pain. Mary had
suffered with some of these conditions for up to 9 years and had
been hopping around from doctor to doctor for relief of individual
symptoms. 
<P>
Fortunately, somebody said to her she ought to try a chiropractor.
People come in my door for back pain because they 
<I>
think 
</I>
that's what chiropractors are good for. Once they get here, they find
out we're able to treat a host of other conditions. They come
to understand chiropractic is about much more than fixing bad
backs; it's actually about enhancing the function of the entire
organism.
<P>
So Mary thought her problem was lower back pain, but actually
<I>
all 
</I>
of her symptoms were compensations resulting from a primary
cause: her sacro-iliac joint was separated.
<P>
Here's what happened. About 15 years earlier, she fell while skiing
and started having problems with her sacrum from that point on;
this in turn led to a dozen different but 
<I>
related 
</I>
complaints.
<P>
The sacrum is the body's main weight-bearing structure. The entire
upper trunk weight comes to rest on the sacrum, which is anchored
in place and held against the two hip bones through tough elastic
weight-bearing ligaments. These ligaments are one of the most
vulnerable parts of the human structure.
<P>
When the sacro-iliac ligaments stretch, the sacrum may go out
of alignment. When the sacrum goes out of alignment, certain vertebrae
can also misalign, such as Lumbar-2, which is a secondary stress
point in the lower back. The L-2 nerves go into the colon, which
is why Mary had bowel problems.   
<P>
During Mary's first treatment, when I adjusted her sacrum, the
nerves going to her colon relaxed. Her bowels never bothered her
again from that first single adjustment. She thought it was a
miracle but this is actually common in chiropractic.
<P>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="CRANIO"> </A>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT>  
<I>
Does a chiropractor use any other techniques besides
adjusting the vertebrae with the hands?
</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Yes, as in Mary's case another technique was needed.
That's because the 
<I>
other 
</I>
cause of her prolonged discomfort was
in her cranium, which reacted as a direct compensation to her
sacrum being misaligned. By cranium, I mean the 14 connected bone
&quot;plates&quot; that make up the skull.
<P>
The cranium and sacrum have a special reciprocal relationship.
As one expands, the other contracts, or you might say, they rock
back and forth. That's part of the 
<I>
cranio-sacral respiratory pump.
</I>
This is a closed-pumping system in the body for circulating cerebrospinal
fluid.
<P>
Inside the bones of the cranium there are tough, elastic membranes
wrapped around the brain, and inside them is the cerebrospinal
fluid. It's manufactured in the brain, goes down the spinal canal,
and then is pumped back up through the rocking action of the sacrum
and the contraction of the cranial membranes.
<P>
There are many things that can upset this system. In Mary's case,
because her sacrum had become dislodged from its correct position,
it could no longer rock properly and that destabilized her cranium.
Once I set her cranium back in place, it made it easier for the
sacral correction to hold. Naturally, her headaches, neck, shoulder,
and back pain went away at once.
<P>
With Mary, I used a lot of blocking and cranial pulse balancing.
Both of these reposition the cranial bones so they will be in
the right place at the right phase of her breathing. Let me explain
these ideas.
<P>
Blocking is an approach discovered by M. B. DeJarnette, D.O.,
D.C., in 1929; he was a chiropractor, osteopath, and mechanical
engineer who used special wedge-shaped blocks to make his sacro-iliac
adjustments. When you position a block correctly under the pelvis,
it will torque accordingly.
<P>
The torque helps to go against the wrong torque already present
in the pelvis. When you lie on the blocks, your own breathing
is the force for the correction. When you stand up, once your
pelvis is recentered, your muscles take stock of the new alignment
and think this is where they're 
<I>
supposed 
</I>
to be and work to keep it in place.
<P>
DeJarnette also discovered a series of points on the back of the
head that he called the 
<I>occipital fibers. 
</I>
There are 7 of these on each side of the skull, or 14 in all; each point corresponds
to a group of vertebrae in the spine. These points can get quite
hard, almost like nodules, if they are left untreated. I often
rub these points vigorously to help release the locked-up energies
and as a gentle way of readjusting the spine.
<P>
Your head, then, has a lot to do with your lower back pain. DeJarnette
used to say: &quot;You'll never fix their backs until you fix
their craniums.&quot;
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT>  
<I>
Does chiropractic ever &quot;fix&quot; someone for
good, or do you always have to come back for more treatments?
</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  It took 15 sessions over 6 months with Mary to resolve
her condition. Now she will come back 1-2 times a year at most
for  maintenance care, unless she has a new trauma that upsets
the system. Chiropractic &quot;fixed&quot; her for good in 6 months
while conventional medicine had failed her for 9 years. Her course
of treatment cost her only about $700, which is a lot less than
even one MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a high tech computerized
scan) which wouldn't have identified the true problem anyway-or
treated it.
<P>
If she had gone to a conventional doctor, she could have ended
up with a medicine chest full of prescription drugs all to palliate
the symptoms. But she couldn't have been any better because her
treatment would not have addressed the underlying structural problem
in her sacro-iliac joint.
<P>
Instead, through chiropractic, Mary not only lost her back pain,
but she gained a whole new feeling of health and robustness. I
dare say she'll probably live a lot longer too. Psychologically,
she became much more relaxed, content, happier, she slept better,
and her blood sugar levels stabilized. She was thrilled to feel
so good.
<P>
Health means you function at 100%. To get this, you need to see
a doctor whose objective is to assist you in fully manifesting
your body's energy, not just smoothing over symptoms. That's real
<I>
health 
</I>
care, not sickness care-and that's what chiropractors 
<I>
really
</I>
do.
