<p align="center"><b>American Nurses Association Reviews Medical
Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
The Congress of Nursing Practice recently approved two motions
regarding the use of marijuana as a medicine.&nbsp; The Congress
agreed to: A) &quot;Support education for RNs regarding current
evidence based therapeutic uses of cannabis,&quot; and B) &quot;Support
investigation of therapeutic efficacy of cannabis in controlled
trials.&quot;&nbsp; These recommendations will be included in a
report from the Congress to the American Nurses Association (ANA)
Board of Directors at their next scheduled meeting. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Congress took up the issue of medical marijuana following a
presentation at the Centennial Conference of the American Nurses
Association by two of the eight legal marijuana patients in support
of the drug's therapeutic value.&nbsp; The Congress also reviewed
a position paper submitted by the Virginia Nurses Association
entitled &quot;Therapeutic Uses of Cannabis,&quot; but failed to
issue a position statement on that issue. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Nevertheless, Mary Lynn Mathre, RN, of Patients Out Of Time said
that the Congress' twofold motion &quot;is a de facto statement
by the ANA that marijuana has medical value; a way of showing support
for similar resolutions passed by other U.S. health care
organizations; and should be recognized by the U.S. government as
a polite way of calling for the denial of marijuana as medicine
for the sick and dying as illogical.&quot;&nbsp; Mathre notes
that state nursing associations of Virginia, Mississippi,
Colorado, New York, and California have endorsed the use of
marijuana as a medicine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Patients Out of Time is a non-profit organization comprised of
five of the eight legal marijuana patients in the United States
and various health care professionals. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Iowa Man Faces Prison Term For Using
Marijuana To Ease Pain</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1996, Waterloo, IA:</b>&nbsp; An
Iowa man is facing prison for using marijuana to relieve the
symptoms of chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia, a painful
muscle disorder.&nbsp; On Monday, October 28, the Black Hawk
County District Court will decide whether to revoke his probation for
refusing to stop smoking marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Allen Helmers sustained a broken back in a 1983 car accident and
was injured again in 1994 after being struck by a drunken
driver.&nbsp; Six months before the second accident, police
seized three ounces of marijuana from Helmers' home.&nbsp; He was
placed on probation for 2 to 5 years under intensive supervision
and fined $1,800. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Helmers says that the pain he suffers daily makes it necessary
that he use marijuana.&nbsp; Helmers' doctor, W. H. Verdyne,
agrees.&nbsp; &quot;Chronic neurological pain responds well to
the medicinal use of marijuana ... causing much less side effects
than the standard pain medications,&quot; Verdyne said.&nbsp; He notes
that routine medications have been unsuccessful in managing
Helmers' pain. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The state of Iowa gave Allen a criminal conviction for
possession of marijuana, and now they want to revoke his
probation because he refuses to stop smoking it,&quot; said Carl
Olsen of Iowans for Medical Marijuana, who organized a protest on
Helmers' behalf earlier this month.&nbsp; &quot;The state of Iowa
has the law on its side.&nbsp; We have love and compassion.&nbsp;
The law must change.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Clinton Proposes Drug Testing Teenage
Applicants For Driver's Licenses</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 19, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
President Clinton proposed a new federal mandate on Saturday to
require teenagers to pass a drug test before receiving a driver's
license. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Stating that a driver's license is a &quot;privilege that should
not be available to those who fail to demonstrate responsible
behavior,&quot; Clinton directed the Office of National Drug
Control Policy to come up with a strategy to implement nationwide
drug testing for all teen applicants.&nbsp; Clinton said that he
hoped the &quot;90 percent [of adolescents] who are
drug-free&quot; would participate in the program willingly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We're already saying to teens if you drink you aren't
allowed to drive.&nbsp; Now we should say that teens should pass
a drug test as a condition of getting a driver's license.&nbsp;
Our message should be simple: No drugs or no driver's
license.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Clinton's announcement drew harsh criticism from civil
libertarians. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Once again we see civil liberties being pulverized by the
political posturing of the president,&quot; charged Libertarian
Presidential candidate Harry Browne.&nbsp; &quot;Once again, we
see millions of Americans having to prove their innocence to
government bureaucrats.&nbsp; ... Once again, we see the 'War on
Drugs' being used as an excuse to give the federal government
more power.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Arthur Spitzer, the legal director of the American Civil
Liberties Union's (ACLU) District of Columbia branch, said the
move was an example of &quot;this drug mania gone
crazy.&quot;&nbsp; He said the organization would consider
mounting a legal challenge. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">It is not yet known whether Clinton's proposal, if implemented,
would be in violation of Constitutional guarantees against
unreasonable search and seizure.&nbsp; Most recently, the Supreme Court
ruled that high school athletes could be randomly drug tested
regardless of individualized suspicion. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Mandatory drug testing is an affront to human dignity, and
it's making a mockery of the United States Constitution,&quot;
said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp;
&quot;Clinton's latest proposal is ill conceived and unjustly
labels an entire generation as suspected drug users.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact either Allen St. Pierre
or Paul Armentano of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i> at (202)
483-5500.&nbsp; The ACLU may be contacted @ (202) 544-1681.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>California Man Fired From Job After Charged
With Growing Marijuana</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 24, 1996, Santa Rosa, CA:</b>&nbsp; An
epileptic charged with marijuana cultivation this past August was
suddenly dismissed from his two caregiver jobs.&nbsp; Alan
Martinez of Santa Rosa maintains that he grows and uses marijuana
as a medicine and plans to raise a medical necessity defense in
court.&nbsp; He notes that individuals like himself, if they
possess a physicians recommendation, would have an exemption
under the law if Proposition 215 passes this November. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Martinez worked for eight years as a well respected caregiver
until his arrest this summer.&nbsp; He believes that the media
attention that surrounded his plea of &quot;not guilty&quot; and
request for a trial to prove his medical necessity has caused his
employers to fire him without notice. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I don't know what I'll do for money, but I know I will be
acquitted and my name will be cleared,&quot; said Martinez.&nbsp;
&quot;I did not expect all the uproar, but I will not back
down.&nbsp; This is a matter of my life and my health.&nbsp; I
hope no other patients have to go through this.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A rally in support of Alan Martinez and his caregiver, Jason
Miller, is scheduled for 12 noon in front of the Santa Rosa Court
House on Tuesday, October 29. <br>
