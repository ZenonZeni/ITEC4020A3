        <H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>THE CHINESE HERB THAT
SUPPRESSES ALCOHOL CRAVINGS</CENTER></H3>



        Alcohol addiction is a widespread and serious problem. Certain animals mimic adult
addictive behavior, and so they are used for studies.  Once alcohol is introduced to
Syrian Golden hamsters, they voluntarily consume a fairly large and steady quantity. 
Furthermore, this species-has been shown to respond favorably to the same drugs that
appear to reduce human alcoholic craving: lithium carbonate, bromocriptine,
buspirone, and zimelidine.

<P>     When a natural substance is shown to have significant value in reducing the
Syrian Golden hamster's craving for alcohol, it's worth taking notice.  The natural
substance is <I>kudzu</I> and its derivatives, <I>daidzin</I> or <I>daidzein</I>.  Kudzu, or Radix
puerariae, is a traditional Chinese herb that has had medicinal uses for centuries. 
It's a fast-growing vine now common throughout the American south.

<P>     The treatment of alcohol abuse has been one of the traditional uses of kudzu in
China since about 600 A.D. It has also been used against flu, fever, dysentery (or
any other overacid condition), and for snake and insect bites.  Kudzu is available in
one of two forms.  Kudzu root starch comes in 3.5-ounce packets in a pebble or powder
form.  Dilute one teaspoon in one cup of cold water and stir until translucent.  Add
to teas, soups, cakes, or puddings.  Or purchase in tablet form, comprised of kudzu
roots and flowers, and take two tablets two or three times a day between meals.
(Combine with ginger root and citrus peel in small amounts to enhance the effects.)

<P>     In a laboratory test conducted in 1993 at the Center for Biochemical and
Biophysical Sciences and Medicine at Harvard Medical School, it was found that daily
injections with an extract of kudzu lowered alcohol intake by an average of 56
percent.  The hamsters tested were offered a free choice-a placebo or a solution
containing 15 percent alcohol (ethanol).  The dosage of kudzu administered
corresponded to about 3.6 ounces for a 150-pound human.  The extract daidzein, which
is a further refinement of kudzu, had a similar effect at approximately one-sixth the
dosage.

<P>     Traditional western medicine isn't likely to incorporate any of this research
into practical treatment for years.  Don't expect this protocol to be part of general
practice until it has been thoroughly studied and the active ingredients isolated (as
a pharmaceutical product).  Meanwhile, if you or someone you know might benefit from
this herb, the herbalists should have kudzu in their arsenal of tools 'just as the
Chinese had for centuries.
