Objectives:             
This unit is designed to give an understanding of the basis of classical 
thermodynamics and its statistical foundations without delving too deeply 
into the mathematical complexities of classical thermodynamics.  

Description:            
Equations of state, zeroth law and temperature, heat and work, internal 
energy, types of processes, first law of thermodynamics, heat capacities, 
heat pumps and Carnot cycle, second law of thermodynamics and entropy, 
kinetic theory of gases and transport theory, Entropy and statistics, 
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function.
