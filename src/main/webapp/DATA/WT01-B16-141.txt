    FOCUS</b></font></p>
    <p><b>LEADERSHIP IN TECHNOLOGY</b> </p>
    <p>Rapid progress is being made in electronic components
    technologies, with attention focused on the submicron level.
    As a customer needs diversify, Sankyo's new production
    technologies, based on fine mechanical technology and
    flexible, manufacturing systems (FMS), enable the Company to
    maintain its position as a market leader.</p>
    <p>Major areas of concentration include office automation,
    audiovisual related products, home automation and home
    appliances and factory automation. Particular emphasis is
    placed on meeting customer specifications regarding quality,
    price and delivery date. </p>
    <p>The Company is a world-leading manufacturer of musical
    movements, direct-drive spindle motors for floppy-disk
    drives, stepping motors used in floppy-disk drives, VCR
    capstan motors, magnetic card readers used in bank systems,
    AC inductor motors for home appliances, defrost controllers
    for refrigerators, optical pick-up units for CD-ROMs and
    magnetic heads for audio products.</p>
    <p>Sankyo is continuing to develop applied technology for
    magnetic materials, function-polymer technology, optical
    devices and semiconductor devices. Sankyo has the technology
    to develop and process component materials. For example,
    utilizing vacuum evaporation technology we developed the
    magnetic resistance element used in the rotary encoder as a
    thin-membrane magnetic sensor. </p>
    <p>Sankyo also develops and markets such materials as
    rare-earth polymer magnetics, used in motors; electronic
    displays, through the application of function-polymer
    technology; and ceraphalloy bearings, manufactured from
    revolutionary bearing materials. By developing its own
    materials, Sankyo is able to respond quickly to customer
    needs. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>FLEXIBLE PRODUCTION</b> </p>
    <p>Sankyo constantly raises the level of its production
    technology and the quality of its products. The key concept
    behind Sankyo's production technology is the Built-Block
    System (BBS). A production line is usually made up of blocks
    tailored to production of specific goods and of blocks that
    cover widely used, fundamental movements. Sankyo's BBS adds
    versatility and flexibility to these important blocks,
    significantly delaying obsolescence. Our systems can easily
    switch from small-to mass-scale production. The BBS has
    enabled Sankyo to produce more sophisticated products at a
    lower cost than other companies. We are now manufacturing the
    majority of our mass-produced products overseas. </p>
    <p>Sankyo's accumulated FA technology enables the Company to
    develop and promote such products as multiple processing
    machines, automatic assembly equipment and industrial robots.
    As we approach the 21<sup>st</sup> century, Sankyo, through
    its diverse lines ranging from industrial products to
    household appliances, aims to increase its contributions to
    society. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>QUALITY FIRST</b> </p>
    <p>Sankyo has continued to improve its quality control
    technology, for which it won a Deming Prize in 1976, as well
    as strengthen its expertise in such key technologies as we
    continue the Company's established work on optomechatronics
    technology. Sankyo also gains considerable benefit from
    research and development carried out in cooperation with its
    close business partner, Nippon Steel Corporation. Using the
    new technologies developed with Nippon Steel, Sankyo creates
    innovative products for communications, health, office
    automation and household-related areas. <br>

    height="132"><font color="#FF0000" size="5"><b>MUSICAL
    PRODUCTS DIVISION</b></font> </p>
    <p>Sankyo's operations are rooted in the Musical Products
    Division. The Company holds the largest share of the world
    market for musical movements.</p>
    <p>The key to Sankyo's dominance of the market is its ability
    to offer the world's most reliable musical movements at a
    highly competitive price. It has been able to do so by
    implementing the world's first mass-production methods for
    these products. This kind of self-reliance is a cornerstone
    of Sankyo's corporate philosophy.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, the manufacture of musical movements was a
    highly labor-intensive process. Recently however, increasing
    automation has meant tremendous leaps in production and
    assembly capability. By automating nearly all processes,
    Sankyo has increased productivity and achieved uniform
    quality-critical factors in supporting Sankyo's dominance of
    the musical movements industry.</p>
    <p>The Company's presence in the industry is not limited to
    Japan. Sankyo maintains an international manufacturing
    presence in Malaysia and Taiwan, and since January 1995 in
    Guangzhou, China. We also have a marketing presence in the
    U.S., Europe and Hong Kong. </p>
    <p>Musical movements-and the music boxes that depend on
    them-have a 200-year history. Before the invention of the
    phonograph in 1877, the only instrument available that did
    not require a musician to play it was the music box. They
    were difficult to acquire and treasured by the few who could
    afford them. During this century, musical movements have
    changed, partially as a result of the mass-production
    technology pursued by Sankyo, and music boxes have become
    widely available. </p>
    <p>Sankyo has pursued the development of ever-richer sounding
    music boxes. The Company's top-of-the-line Orpheus series,
    marketed since 1985, features two-tune deluxe 50-note
    movements. This series has been very well received,
    particularly in the collectibles market. Furthermore, after
    years of R&amp;D, we introduced an 80-note disc music box in
    1995. The disc music box, which allows the listener to
    exchange discs and hear any number of tunes, took Europe and
    the U.S. by storm in the days before the phonograph rose to
    prominence. One hundred years have passed since then, and now
    the disc music box is making a comeback as businesses and
    hobbyists create a new market for its gorgeous sounds. </p>
    <p>The advance of production technology has led to a
    diversification of function. Sankyo is now aggressively
    developing new products in a wide range of fields based on
    the technologies accumulated through the creation and
    improvement of music boxes. Soft-ejecting mechanisms are just
    one example. New applications of our Eou's melody integrated
    circuit units have enabled us to create special new products
    where small, thin, lightweight formats are required.
    Furthermore, Sankyo is also manufacturing superior 30-note
    and 50-note movements for luxury-class music boxes. </p>
    <p>Since 1985, the Company's Suwa Plant has been dedicated to
    producing quality musical movements. The entire manufacturing
    process of the plant-from the requisition of raw materials to
    product shipment-is integrated and fully automated. Strict
    process and quality control management in this plant led to
    its winning a Nihon Keizai Shimbun (Japan Economic Journal)
    national advanced plant award for excellence in 1987 and a
    Japan Plant Maintenance Foundation first class award for
    excellence in plant maintenance in 1993. <br>

    <p>To strengthen our electronic component businesses, which
    encompass such products as DC micromotors, AC servomotors,
    optical pickups and magnetic heads, we integrated marketing,
    development, production and overseas strategies for the
    Motors, Devices and Electromagnetic Components Divisions in
    July 1994. This headquarters system allows us to combine
    strong points that were previously dispersed among these
    different divisions. </p>
    <p>Through this reorganization, the common functions of the
    three divisions have been divided into an Operation Planning
    Division and a Marketing &amp; Sales Division from the
    business divisions was particularly helpful in improving
    customer service and the collection of market information,
    while also making it possible for us to offer products that
    more closely match customer needs.</p>
    <p>Also, by giving the R&amp;D Center the rank of a new
    business promotion group within the Electronic Components
    Headquarters, we created a group with dual production and
    sales functions unlike those of any other business division.
    This allows us to respond quickly to dizzying changes in

    use of software and firmware technology, and the development
    of an array of optomechatronics products which meet user
    needs through the union of such areas as high-level analog
    technology, ultra-accurate optics technology, hardware and
    software. Sankyo holds great expectations for its data system
    machines area-an area that answers the requirements of the
    times. </p>
    <p>The division's magnetic card reader was certified eligible
    for the international quality standard ISO 9001 in February
    1994. <br>

    <p><b>ROBOTICS AND MACHINE TOOLS AREA</b> </p>
    <p>In 1962, Sankyo began manufacturing and marketing
    precision machinery. The Company was able to draw upon the
    expertise it had accumulated since its establishment in 1946
    in the design and manufacture of production machinery for
    musical movements. Since then, Sankyo has improved and
    expanded its production facilities in order to meet the need
    for increased volume, efficiency and quality. Similarly,
    Sankyo has continuously developed new precision machinery and
    systems. </p>
    <p>Sankyo's products are designed based on the Built-Block
    System (BBS) it developed. Products are divided into a number
    of blocks, in which modular components are assembled
    separately. Manufacturing equipment is also laid out in terms
    of blocks, and can be redeployed or reprogrammed for flexible
    manufacturing. </p>
    <p>The machine tools area presently produces and markets
    special purpose cutting machines, automatic assembly
    equipment and industrial robots. </p>
    <p>Sankyo has extensive experience in the development of
    special-purpose cutting machines. Our technology is highly
    regarded by such top Japanese manufacturers as automobile,
    camera and hard-disk drive makers for the gains in precision
    and productivity it allows.</p>
    <p>Sankyo is the industry leader in assembly robots and is a
    major producer of horizontally articulated robots. Since the
    latter half of fiscal 1984, cumulative consignments have
    totaled more than 10,000 units. </p>
    <p>The durable, high-precision SKILAM series of assembly
    robots, originally developed for in-house use, has sustained
    its excellent results in the market-place. These robots are
    used in the communications, electrical and electronics
    industries for assembly of IC parts and similar intricate
    parts for office automation equipment. </p>
    <p>Sankyo, as the leading producer of assembly robots,
    continues to develop new products and improve existing ones.
    The machine tools area will play a central role in building a
    base for growth. <br>
