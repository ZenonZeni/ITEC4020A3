<P>Most people on the north side of 30 who watched the Extreme Games this past summer on ESPN probably thought, on more than one occasion--during the street luge, sky surfing, skate-boarding, and/or practically any other event&quot;Are these people nuts? Don't they realize they can get hurt? Maybe die?&quot; Of course those exhilarated participants recognized the danger. And yet they took the risks and did awesome and incredible feats because they are willing and able to do so.

<P>For some reason, as people age, they tend to become more conservative, reluctant to change, hesitant about taking risks. Perhaps it's self-preservation. Perhaps it is intimations of mortality writ large in fluorescent letters. A consequence is 
that awesome and incredible feats are the all-too-rare exception, not the rule. Strenuous efforts, if made at all, are undertaken to maintain the status quo. The ethos of the X-Games, &quot;Go big or go home,&quot; gives way to &quot;Go slow or don't go.&quot;

<P>Some people might say that this stay-the-course approach to life is a direct consequence of the wisdom that allegedly comes with age. That is, because we have had the opportunity to try many things through the years, we know what works and what doesn't, and so we do the things that work and avoid the rest. Some other people, those who are on the south side of 30, might skeptically say that it is the physiological fact that as we age our brain gets stiffer and is less capable of dealing with change. Approaches become fossilized.

<P>Organizationally--and remember well and always that organizations are nothing but groups of individuals--this maintaining the status quo can actually be more hazardous than zooming down a hill at 60 mph on an elongated skateboard. That's a message that comes out loud and clear in <I>Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation</I> by James M. Utterback, which first appeared in 1994, and has recently been published in paperback form (Harvard Business School Press; 288 pp.; $15.95). Utterback describes with clarity and detail just how companies that seem to be in rock-solid, safe positions can become memories in short order.

<P>&quot;This book argues,&quot; Utterback writes, &quot;that innovation is a central determinant of longer-run success and failure for manufacturing firms.&quot; He goes on to note--and explain with vivid examples--that companies that seem to be 
unassailable &quot;not only resist innovative threats, but actually resist all effort to understand them, preferring to further entrench their positions in the older products.&quot; &quot;Older products&quot; being those that the company has 
been producing. It seems that what happens is that when faced with a new competitive threat--a 
discontinuous innovation, something that breaks 
with the status quo--the tendency in most 
organizations is to get really good at doing what they've always done. Unfortunately, while that 
may provide some temporary salvation, in the long run it is a dead end.

<P>For example, in describing the U.S. auto industry, he points out that companies started entering in 1894 and the number of active companies that existed for at least five years peaked at 75 in 1923. Within two years, almost one-third of the companies merged with others or disappeared, and the decline continued apace. To be sure, there were factors like the Great Depression that had an effect on businesses, auto companies included. But Utterback points out that in 1923 the all-steel, closed body car was introduced by Dodge. &quot;This new body format,&quot; he writes, &quot;dramatically improved the strength and rigidity of the chassis, and at the same time provided an opportunity for manufacturers to move away from hand forming of exterior body panels to the highly capitalized but efficient process of machine stamping.&quot; It became the dominant design. Those companies that tried to continue on with other approaches soon found themselves out of business. Those companies that got really good at the processes required to produce steel bodies excelled.

<P>Chances are, the vehicle as we know it is probably not going to change much. But at the component level, things will continue to change like mad. Think, if you will, about carburetors, and how quickly fuel injectors came to the fore.

<P>Some organizations realize that the future isn't what the past was or the present is. And so they invest in incremental improvements and modest change programs. Utterback thinks this approach is insufficient: &quot;Investments in incremental change may produce measurable benefits in the short term, but they cannot save established firms when their markets are demolished. These firms will not find their long-term vitality renewed, but will follow the lead of the gas lighting industry, the ice harvesters of New England, and others who have failed to make the bold leap across chasms of technological 
discontinuity.&quot;

<P>Changes will happen. There seems to be but one alternative: Go big or go home.
