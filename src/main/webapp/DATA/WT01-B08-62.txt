        <p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;The ongoing trade disputes
        between Mercosur's two main members have erupted again,
        this time over oil deregulation and export and investment
        incentives.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Argentina forced by its business
        community is complaining that the Brazilian oil market,
        contrary to what has happened in Argentina where the
        market has been completelly deregulated, continues
        restricted and dominated by Petrobras, and is still
        waiting for Congress to consider a
        &quot;flexibilisation&quot; bill.</font></p>

    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><font face="Arial">The other
        area of dispute is the package of incentives to promote
        exports, (almost a billion dollars in soft loans and
        reimboursment of taxes) which the Brazilian federal
        government recently decided in an attempt to diminish the
        balance of trade deficit.</font><p><font face="Arial">Similarly
        many of the Brazilian states have their own fiscal
        incentives to attract foreign investments in the steel,
        cheminal and paper industries, which offset Argentina's
        hopes for industrial development.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The Brazilian press has been quiet
        caustic about the whole situation saying that &quot;<em>Argentina
        wants Brazil to solve its self made economic problems.
        Our endemic trade deficit with Argentina only helps to
        finance Argentine purchases in the US</em>&quot;, said a
        leading Brazilian industrialist in the main business
        publication of Sao Paulo.</font></p>

        Mercosur trade, commercial, customs and diplomatic
        disputes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The resolution was taken in spite
        of the opposition of the Brazilian judicial delegation
        which considers the special Court &quot;<em>costly and
        unnecessary</em>&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The special Court will have its
        seat in Asuncion, Paraguay and will be the first step
        towards the unification of the regional community legal
        systems.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">&quot;<em>It's still too early to
        think about a special supra-national Court, at least
        until we have considered and passed an appropiate and
        efficient community legislation, which should benefit all
        country members and associates</em>&quot;, said Nelson
        Jobim, the Brazilian Minister of Justice.</font></p>

        existance, the legislative branch of the five countries
        involved must render its approval.</font></p>
