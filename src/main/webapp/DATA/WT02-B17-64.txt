<P>Each
year, the U.S. government buys more than $10 billion in energy-related
products.  As the world's largest customer, the Federal government can
have a significant effect on the availability and cost of
energy-efficient products.</P><P>In 1994, twenty-two of the largest
Federal agencies signed the Energy Efficiency and Resource Conservation
Challenge, a government-wide commitment to use Federal buying power to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>support and expand markets for today's best-practice products that
save energy, water, or use renewable energy;</LI>
<LI>create new entry markets for advanced, energy-saving technologies
and products;</LI>
<LI>lower the costs of efficient products for all consumers by
providing a large, reliable market;</LI>
<LI>reduce agency operating costs and save taxpayers' money;</LI>
<LI>lower Federal energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions; and</LI>
<LI>provide a model for other levels of government, corporate, and
institutional purchasers.</LI></UL>

<P>The "Procurement Challenge" is
cosponsored by the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) at the <A HREF="http://www.doe.gov/"
>US Department of Energy (DOE)</A>.  The Challenge is designed to help
agencies meet their multiyear goals for saving energy and water, as set
forth in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) and Executive Order
12902.  These two policy documents direct Federal agencies to buy
products that are in the upper 25% of the market, in terms of energy
efficiency, and are at least 10% more efficient than the national
standards set by DOE.</P>

<P>To help agencies implement these policies,
DOE issues energy-efficiency recommendations for selected products
widely used by government.  For each type of product, these one-page
documents identify the level of energy performance that is equal to the
top 25% of the market.  DOE is also working with the two main Federal
supply agencies, the <A HREF="http://www.gsa.gov/">General Services
Administration (GSA)</A> and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), to identify
and "code" those products in the supply system which meet the DOE
efficiency criteria.  Product codes are now starting to appear in
<A HREF="http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/">published catalogs</A> and will be
included in the on-line systems for "electronic commerce" now under
development by both supply agencies.</P>

<P>For individual consumers, or
government buyers who use commercial sources, another important source
of advice on energy-efficient products is the<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/docs/GCDOAR/EnergyStar.html"
> ENERGY STAR (TM)</A> label sponsored by the
<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/">US Environmental Protection Agency</A>
and by DOE.  This label identifies energy-efficient products such as
computers and office equipment, air conditioners, furnaces, lighting,
and household appliances.  The Federal purchasing recommendations are
coordinated with ENERGY STAR (TM) criteria.  A listing of products that
qualify for the ENERGY STAR TM label is available from EPA, at their
Worldwide Web site or by fax (see below).  Energy efficiency is also
included as one element of third-party environmental labeling
organizations, such as Green Seal and Scientific Certification Systems. 
Other sources of product information are identified in the section on "<A HREF="resources"
>Resources</A>," below.</P>

<P>A new non-profit organization, the
Energy-Efficient Procurement Collaborative is promoting energy-efficient
purchasing by states and local government agencies.  Collectively, these
other public sector buyers account for 3-4 times the volume of
purchasing by the Federal government itself.  The Collaborative
publishes a directory of information sources on efficient products, and
is developing an on-line data network to make it easier to connect
directly with these different data bases.  The Collaborative will also
be collecting and publishing model specifications and encouraging its
members to join in high-volume purchasing of energy-efficient products.
A contact number for the Collaborative is provided in the "<A HREF="resources"
>Resources</A>" section below.</P>

<P>Last, the DOE program is exploring
ways to use Federal buying-power to help speed the commercial
introduction of new technologies and products.  A study, to be released
in early 1997, will bring together views from Federal agencies,
manufacturers, and suppliers on how to improve the existing methods of
market-entry in the Federal sector.</P>
