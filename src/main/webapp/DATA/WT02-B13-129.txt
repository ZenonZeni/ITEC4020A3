<a name="RTFToC2">Immigration's
Costs and Benefits</a> 
</a></h2>
The Brookings Institution held a National Issues Forum in Washington, DC on
February 16, 1994 at which most speakers agreed that the United States must "do
something" about illegal immigration.  However, there was little agreement on
what should be done.<p>
The impetus for the conference seemed to be Governor Pete Wilson's (R-Ca)
assertion that the State of California incurs at least $3.6 billion in
unreimbursed costs to provide services to 1.3 million illegal aliens.  The
costs and benefits of immigrants are becoming a much-debated issue in
Washington, especially after Governor Chiles (D-Fla) sued the United States for
reimbursement, and the governors of Texas, New York and Illinois joined the
call for federal assistance to high immigration states.  These five states
included 81 percent of the 3.2 million illegal aliens that the INS estimated
were in the US in 1992. <p>
Wilson requested that the federal government either: (1) reimburse California
for two-thirds of these costs, or (2) repeal the mandate that California
provide these services.  The Governor's representative cast the issue as one in
which the federal government's failure to enforce immigration laws combined
with mandates to provide services to illegal immigrants imposes an unfair cost
on the states and cities in which they concentrate.<p>
Illegal immigrant children are eligible for free public education (1982 Supreme
Court decision), emergency Medicaid assistance (50-50 federal-state cost
sharing), and school lunch and pre-natal services.  If the federal government
eliminated the mandate to provide, e.g. Medicaid, states could see their costs
rise, since they would then bear the full cost of the emergency health services
that all agreed would in any event be provided.<p>
But what is the basis for the demands that the federal government enforce
immigration laws, repeal mandates to provide services to illegal aliens, or
reimburse states for their costs of providing such services?  It is true that
immigration is at its highest level in 100 years, and that 45 percent of the 20
million foreign-born persons enumerated in the 1990 Census Of Population
arrived since 1980, but some speakers emphasized that research fails to find
that immigrants displace U.S.-born workers or depress their wages, or that
immigrants are more dependent on welfare than U.S. citizens.  Instead, their
argument went, immigrants must be subdivided into categories and, when they
are, refugees have the highest rates of welfare dependency, legal immigrants
aged 15-64 have a lower rate, and illegal aliens have the lowest rate, since
most are trying to avoid seeking even those few services for which they are
eligible.<p>
Most speakers returned to basics to emphasize that the United States welcomes
legal immigrants through three major doors: family unification, humanitarian,
and needed workers.  Several speakers argued that the United States correctly
permits a U.S. citizen with a foreign spouse or dependents to bring them to the
United States immediately, and that it is also good social policy to permit
legal immigrants to have their immediate families join them.  Some speakers
questioned the "minor" family-oriented admissions doors, such as the provision
through which the adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens can enter, and the
door reserved for the brothers and sisters of U.S. immigrants.  There was also
criticism of the "diversity lottery" that favors immigrants from Europe.<p>
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the discussion was the agreement that
something must be done about illegal immigration.  There were several paths to
this common action item.  For some, fears of job displacement and wage
depression were sufficient reasons for action.  For others, fears of cultural
upheavals, population growth, or environmental degradation were reasons for
action.  For the states and cities, action is justified by the cost of
providing services, while the INS agreed that widespread lawbreaking
represented by illegal immigration undermined its reputation.  Some of those
advocating prompt and drastic action against illegal immigration outlined a
series of national dilemmas - from the underclass to public education - and
questioned whether more immigrants - legal or illegal - help the nation to
solve these problems.<p>
Most speakers were pro-immigration, and they made their case for action to
reduce illegal immigration on the grounds that, if nothing is done now, there
will be harsher measures later.  Some feared what one termed a "jihad" (holy
war) against immigrants would go "too far."  Several emphasized that
"anti-immigrant hysteria" was due to California's economic woes, the inability
of the INS to effectively enforce immigration laws, and the end of the Cold
War, which undercut support for the foreign-born group most likely to receive
public assistance for extended periods of time - refugees.  These "defenders of
immigrants" hope to keep open the family, refugee, and economic doors for
newcomers by supporting efforts to close the back door to illegal aliens.  <p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Administration's
"Comprehensive Response" to Immigration</a></a>
</a></h2>
On February 3, 1994, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno announced a five-point
plan to curb illegal immigration, speed up the processing of applicants for
asylum, and promote the naturalization of eligible immigrants.  The proposal
fulfills President Clinton's July 1993 promise to deal with immigration when he
named Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner and,
if fully implemented, would raise the INS budget almost 25 percent, from $1.6
billion in FY93 to $2.1 billion in FY95.<p>
1.	AG Reno described the plan to spend $368 million in FY95 to add 1,010 Border
Patrol (BP) agents in El Paso and San Diego as "deterrence through prevention."
Almost two-thirds of all INS apprehensions are made in these two sectors, and
the extra funds would enable the BP to add 620 agents to its current 4,100, to
add lights and another fence in San Diego, and to fingerprint all apprehended
aliens.<p>
2.	An additional $55.2 million per year would enable the INS to deport an
estimated 20,000 criminal aliens each year from California, Texas, Florida, and
Illinois.  <p>
3.	The number of judges hearing requests for asylum would be doubled from 150
to 300 with an additional $64.1 million, so that the number of asylum
applicants who could be processed annually would rise from 45,000 to 150,000.
Asylum applicants would be expected to pay a $130 fee to apply, and would have
to wait 150 days to get a work permit.  With the help of the extra asylum
officers, the 364,000 backlog of asylum cases would eventually be cleared.<p>
4.	The INS would devote $23 million to target for enforcement, under the 1986
employer sanctions law, "high-violator" industries, such as agriculture,
construction, janitorial and similar services, and garments and similar
manufacturing.  The INS plans to reduce from 29 to 3 the number of work
authorization documents a worker can present to an employer, and add a magnetic
stripe to the back of the INS-551 greencard carried by legal immigrants.  In
addition, the telephone system for employers to verify worker documents would
be expanded.<p>
5.	The "balancing" or generosity feature of the plan is a commitment of $30
million annually--half in the form of grants to community groups--to promote
the naturalization of eligible immigrants, those who have been in the United
States at least five years and can pass a rudimentary English and civics
test.<p>
Most of these proposals are part of the Crime Bill moving through Congress, and
may not be implemented unless that bill is enacted.<p>
Reaction to the Administration's plan was generally positive; both Republican
and Democratic politicians in California praised the plan as a "balanced"
effort to deal with reducing illegal immigration and promoting the acceptance
of the newcomers who arrived in the past 10 to 20 years.  FAIR and several
Congressmen criticized the proposal as "too little," and for not beefing up
border enforcement in New Mexico and Arizona.  Other critics argued that the
Administration's plan should have put more emphasis on employer sanctions
enforcement, that preventive deterrence at the border will merely redirect
illegal immigrants around newly-fortified areas, and that the potential for
violence is increased because, with higher coyote fees, migrants will be less
willing to risk apprehension.  Mexico protested that beefing up border
enforcement could "harm relations between neighboring communities" and hinder
the cooperation needed to implement NAFTA.<p>
The House Republican Task Force on Immigration, headed by Lamar Smith
(R-Texas), on February 10, 1994 unveiled its own plan to reduce illegal
immigration.  It would require the INS to construct fences and ditches in areas
where most illegal aliens are apprehended, add 6,000 more Border Patrol agents
to the current 4,000 by 1998, and phase in over five years a tamper-proof
Social Security card that all newly-hired workers would have to present to
their employers.  The Task Force estimated that there are 4.8 million illegal
aliens (versus a 3.5 million INS estimate), and that they cost taxpayers a new
$7.6 billion annually.<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Operation
Hold the Line in Texas</a></a>
</a></h2>
Frank Bean of the University of Texas-Austin is completing a study of the
effectiveness of Operation Blockade (today known as Operation Hold the Line) on
the US-Mexican border in El Paso.  The Commission on Immigration Reform,
chaired by Barbara Jordan, will review Bean's study at a meeting March 18-19 in
El Paso.<p>
According to Bean, there were 4 distinct types of illegal border crossers, and
the two that caused the most problems in El Paso were stopped, explaining the
popularity of the operation.  Long-distance migrants headed to interior US
locations and daily commuters were not deterred by the massing of agents on the
border--for both groups, crossing the border became less convenient and more
expensive, but was not stopped.  However, Mexican teens who partied in El Paso,
and committed crimes there, as well as sidewalk vendors, were deterred, to the
relief of the people of El Paso.<p>

</a></h2>
Federal assistance for rebuilding Los Angeles after the January 17, 1994
earthquake was held up for several days by wrangling in Congress over the
eligibility of illegal aliens for non-emergency assistance funds.  As enacted
on February 11, 1994, the $8.6 billion appropriation permits FEMA to provide
emergency shelter, food, and medical assistance without inquiring about an
individual's legal status, but it requires federal agencies to take
"reasonable" steps to ascertain the legal status of anyone seeking longer-term
aid (lasting more than 90 days) such as 18-month HUD housing grants, about
their legal status.  Democrat Esteba Torres (D-Ca) sponsored the amendment to
prevent an even tougher ban on federal assistance from being passed.<p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Governors
Ask for Federal Reimbursement of Immigrant Costs; Budget Director Says Don't
Count on It</a></a>
</a></h2>
With governors from California (Republican), Florida (Democrat), Illinois (R),
New York (D), and Texas (D) suing or threatening to sue the federal government
to recover their estimated costs of providing services to illegal immigrants,
there is now bipartisan pressure on the federal government to deal with the
issue.  The two Republican and three Democratic governors are turning what had
been seen as an individual crusade by California's Governor Wilson(R) to shift
the blame for the state's problems to Washington into a more serious issue that
can no longer be ignored.  As a result of the pressure, the Clinton
Administration announced on February 1 that it is forming a bipartisan "working
group" to push for federal legislation to help alleviate the costs associated
with illegal immigration. The focus will be on education, emergency health care
and the incarceration of illegal immigrants. <p>
But White House Budget Director Leon Panetta, a former Congressman from
California, warned a group of California lawmakers in Washington, DC to lobby
for increase federal funding on February 22, 1994 that they should not expect
any more funds to help compensate for illegal immigration. <p>
Studies of the public finance impacts of legal and illegal immigrants agree on
only a few points, including:<p>
1.	The taxes paid by especially unskilled and illegal immigrants accrue
primarily to the federal government and its Social Security trust funds.<p>
2.	At the state and local levels, taxes-paid calculations depend heavily on
assumptions about the number, earnings, and U.S. expenditures of illegal
immigrants.  Costs are very sensitive to assumptions about illegal aliens'
receipt of work-related and public benefits, and whether the cost of providing
(required) services such as schooling for illegal alien children or AFDC to
their U.S.-born and citizen babies should be chargeable to illegal aliens
generally.<p>
A new study by Jeffrey Passel, director of immigration research at the Urban
Institute in Washington, DC says that California's immigrants contribute $12
billion more each year in taxes and other payments, than they cost in
schooling, health care and other services. Passel contradicts a study by Donald
Huddle of Rice University,  that immigrants take thousands of jobs from US
workers and cost California more than $18 billion annually. Nationally, Passel
concludes that immigrants contribute $28.7 billion more in taxes than they use
in services. Huddle finds that immigrants cost about $42.5 billion annually.
Both studies did not focus on illegal immigrants, but on all foreigners living
in the country since 1970. <p>

<a name="RTFToC7">US
Labor Department Scrutinizing Temporary Foreign Workers</a></a>
</a></h2>
The Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT) revised the rules under which temporary
foreign workers can be admitted to the US, and one result is an increased
number of US employers applying for temporary foreign programmers and other
computer professionals.  <p>
	US employers wishing to hire foreign workers must complete a Labor Condition
Application (LCA) that asserts that the US employer has tried to recruit US
workers at the prevailing wage for the area or the wage that is paid to similar
workers elsewhere.  The US Department of Labor receives few complaints about
these LCAs: there were only 7 complaints filed about the 100,000 LCAs filed
between October, 1991 and May, 1993.  Complaints skyrocketed during the summer
of 1993, and the TV show 60 Minutes charged that "body shops" were engaged in
massive immigration fraud to obtain low-wage computer programmers.  Three days
after the 60 Minutes program, the DOL proposed regulations that would allow it
to initiate an investigation even if no complaint had been filed.<p>
Many US employers do not adhere to current regulations, which require that a
separate LCA that explains how the prevailing and actual wage were determined
for each foreign worker, that exclude the value of housing or other benefits
from the calculation of wages, and that explain any apparent discrepancies in
pay, such as occur when two programmers have the same job description but
different rates of pay.  US employers might make their LCAs available to
"interested parties" upon request.<p>

<a name="RTFToC8">Devaluations
Increase Mexico-to-US Migration</a></a>
</a></h2>
The threat of increased unwanted migration from Mexico was used to argue for
and against  NAFTA during the Fall 1993 US debate over its ratification.  The
consensus among migration researchers was that Mexico-to-US migration would
first increase as a result of the continued demand-pull of US jobs; increased
supply-push in rural Mexico, as corn prices were lowered over 15 years by 50
percent; and the absence of measures to break the networks that had been
perhaps unexpectedly been strengthened by US immigration reforms in 1986 and
1990.  Most migration researchers nonetheless supported NAFTA as the best
long-term strategy to reduce unwanted Mexican migration.<p>
At a session held February 22, 1994 during the annual meetings of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science in San Francisco, J. Edward Taylor,
a University of California, Davis professor of agricultural economics,
presented evidence that a 10 percent devaluation of the peso has an effect on
increasing emigration that is six times larger than a 10 percent decrease in
the price of corn.  Taylor constructed a CGE model of a village economy with
1989 survey data, and showed that, since half of the villagers are subsistence
corn farmers, they are not hurt, and in some cases helped, by lower corn
prices. <i> </i>In his model, a drop in the price of corn from  $4 to $3.60 per
bushel would increase migration by only 2.6 percent, or from 100 to 103
migrants in this village of 1000.  A 10 percent devaluation of the peso, on the
other hand, would lead in Taylor's simulation to a 17 percent increase in
emigration, from 100 to 117 migrants.   <p>
Taylor's model suggests that rural villagers connected to overseas destinations
by networks know about and respond to exchange rate changes.  Such a migration
response to a devaluation occurred in Nigeria early in 1994 (See Devaluation
Prompts Migration to Nigeria).<p>
Mexico's economy grew just 0.4 percent in 1993, well below the 2.6 percent
growth of 1992 and the three percent expected in 1994.  Both the auto and oil
sectors--both important foreign-exchange earners--contracted in 1993, putting
limits on the social spending the government was expected to undertake in the
1994 election year.  Mexico may raise money by selling off its remaining stake
in Mexican banks, and perhaps by beginning to sell of parts of PEMEX.  Tight
monetary and fiscal polices pursued when the fate of NAFTA was in doubt have
brought interest rates on Mexican treasury bills to below 10 percent for the
first time in 15 years.<p>
Agricultural production rose by 1.8 percent in 1993, compared to a drop of 1.5
percent in 1992.  However, farmers throughout the country are linking their
demands for government assistance to the uprising in Chiapas, and the
government is expected to double its spending on agriculture in 1994.  <p>
The Chiapas uprising seems to have awakened Mexicans to the plight of those
left behind in the rush to restructure Mexico's economy.  Bishop Ruiz of
Chiapas says that Mexico's wealthy must be prepared to redistribute some of
their wealth and thus avoid misery and violence. <p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Multiculturalism
under Fire in Canada</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Canada's 1988 Multiculturalism Act was attacked in the House of Commons after
the government issued its fifth annual report on activities supported under the
act.  In 1993-94, the Multiculturalism Department made grants totaling C$ 25.5
million, half of which is spent on programs that reach all Canadians,
one-fourth of which is spent to combat racism (including the annual March 21
anti-racism day), and one-fourth is spent to support ethnic artists and ethnic
studies.  Multiculturalism was the policy that emerged from a 1971 Royal
Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. <p>
Several Reform MP's demanded that the Multiculturalism Department be abolished.
The grants it currently makes to ethnic groups, they argue, tend to "ghettoize
ethnic minorities," and promote group differences rather than pride in being
Canadian.  During the Fall 1993 campaign, Reform Party leader Preston Manning
called for cutting immigration from 250,000 to 150,000 annually, and end to
federal spending on multicultural activities.  Bloc Quebecois MPs opposed
multiculturalisms because, they asserted, the government's policy ignores
Quebec's distinctiveness.<p>
The government responded that diversity does not have to lead to division, that
newcomers have a right to live in ethnic enclaves, and that multiculturalism
strengthens Canada's economy by forging new international trade links.<p>
Multiculturalism is an especially contentious issue in Toronto, whose almost 4
million residents are 60 percent non-English or French (31 percent of Canada's
27.3 million people in 1991 had neither English or French roots).  Canada's 4.3
million foreign-born residents, 16 percent of the population, are concentrated
in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.  <p>

Children in US Schools</a></a>
</a></h2>
A study of 5,200 immigrant school children in San Diego, Fort Lauderdale, and
Miami found that the immigrant children performed better in US schools because
they spend three times more hours on homework and have families that stress the
importance of education.  Michigan State University Sociology Professor Ruben
Rumbat and Alejandro Portes studied 8th and 9th grade children with at least
one immigrant parent who were born in the US or had been here for at least 5
years, and found that the "immigrant children" spent an average three hours on
homework per day, versus one hour for children with two US citizen parents.  <p>
The median gradepoint of all students in San Diego was 2.11; that of Vietnamese
and Asian immigrant children was 2.9, while Mexican immigrant children had a
median gradepoint of 2.0.  More than 1 million of California's 5 million school
children do not speak English at home; these data suggest that parental support
and expectations can overcome language barriers to assure US educational
success.<p>
In a related story, a California legislator released videotape of children who
live in Mexico and cross the border daily to attend US  schools.  As a result,
20 percent of the 2200 school children in the Mountain Empire School District
southeast of San Diego are expected to be dismissed because their parents used
false US addresses to enroll them.  Children living in Mexico may attend US
schools by paying an annual tuition of $3,200.<p>

<a name="RTFToC13">EU
Commission Approves Communication on Immigration and Asylum</a></a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The European Commission adopted Immigration Commissioner Padraig Flynn's
suggestions on how to develop a coordinated response to the immigration and
asylum issues facing the European Union. The communication asserts that the
immigration and asylum policies must be integrated into the EU's external
policies. Action would occur at a number of levels including trade, development
and cooperation policies, humanitarian assistance and human rights. The next
phase of the commission will be to use its power to translate the ideas into
action. <p>
The European Commission also approved a call for all European Union member
countries to adopt a common definition of "asylum seeker."  Flynn noted that
all EU countries subscribe to the Geneva Convention, but some interpret it
differently, so that some consider asylum seekers from the former Yugoslavia to
be refugees, while others put them in a temporary displace persons category.<p>
There were 550,000 asylum applications in Europe in 1993, down from 679,900 in
1992 because of a 25 percent drop in applications in Germany, and a 50 percent
drop in applications in France and the UK.  A common asylum policy is
considered necessary because of spillover effects.  When Germany tightened its
asylum policies in mid-1993, both Belgium and the Netherlands saw asylum
applications rise. <p>
Germany has since August 1993 been receiving about 15,000 asylum applicants
monthly.  About 40 percent are from the former Yugoslavia, and 10 percent are
from Turkey; the largest drops are in applications from Romania and Bulgaria.
If the EU adopts a tighter common policy, some fear that Eastern European
nations such as Poland and Czechoslovakia will see a rise in asylum
applications.<p>
Flynn also wants the EU countries to discuss a common immigration policy.
Immigration into the EU is officially stopped, but some countries permit family
unification, the return of citizens abroad, and other types of immigrants to
enter.  The EU is working on a common visa application form for nationals of
those countries that will need a visa to enter the EU.<p>
Britain is expected to strongly object to any plans to give Europe's 10 million
immigrants full Community citizenship. Home Secretary Michael Howard and Prime
Minster John Majors are expected to make it clear that, although Britain will
cooperate with member states on immigration and asylum issues, it will not give
third country nationals settled in France and Germany equal status with
European nationals in Britain. <p>

to Return Croats</a></a>
</a></h2>
Germany in September 1993 informed the 60,000 to 100,000 Croats in the country
that they would have to leave the country by April 30, 1994 or face deportation
proceedings.  After sharp criticism, the German government on February 9, 1994
extended until June 30, 1995 the residence rights of Croats who cannot return
to their homes because their homes are in Serbian controlled areas.  However,
those from "peaceful areas" will have to leave Germany between May 1 and
October 31, 1994.  <p>
	The Federal Government's Commissioner for Foreigners, Cornelia
Schmalz-Jacobsen, expressed satisfaction that the Croats were divided into two
groups.  She urged the federal government to reimburse individual states for
the number of refugees within them.  The decision was criticized by those who
argued that conscientious objectors should not be returned to Croatia, and by
those who urged that all Balkan refugees should be allowed to stay in  Germany
until the war there is over.<p>
Germany is reportedly pushing for the return of the Croats because of a housing
shortage and the financial costs of caring for them; not to appease an
anti-immigrant public in an election year in which there is high unemployment.
There were four million unemployed in January 1994, a rate of almost nine
percent in the former West Germany and 17 percent in the former East Germany.
Germany is host to 370,000 people from the former Yugoslavia, and spent DM 5
billion($3 billion) caring for asylum seekers and other immigrants in 1993.<p>

<a name="RTFToC22">Philippines
Proposes Labor Agreement</a></a>
</a></h2>
Filipino National Security Adviser Jose Almonte proposed that labor migration
be formally included in the agenda of the Asian Free Trade Area(AFTA) to help
resolve problems associated with illegal workers in Brunei, Singapore and
Malaysia.  Almonte proposed that region-wide ground rules be established to
deal with migrant workers in the region, and that  Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan be persuaded to join the regional labor agreement.<p>
As the largest labor exporter in the region, the Philippines has a special
interest in the problems of migrant workers.  Despite its call for a regional
labor agreement, the Philippines recently began bilateral negotiations with
Malaysia to deal with the estimated 190,000 Filipinos in Sabah.  Malaysia
recognizes 80,000 Filipinos as refugees, and is negotiating a bilateral
agreement with the Philippines over the fate of unauthorized Filipino migrants
in Malaysia.<p>
Filipino migrants still go predominantly to the Middle East:  in 1993, 543,410
workers were deployed abroad, and an additional 145, 758 seafarers.  However,
Filipinos are increasingly migrating to other East Asian nations.  For example,
in 1993, almost as many Filipino migrants were deployed to Taiwan (13,189) as
to Saudi Arabia (13,259), representing a dramatic change from 1992.  Over
80,000 Filipino migrants were sent legally to East Asia in the first half of
1993, including 34,000 to Hong Kong and 20,921 to Japan; an estimated 22,000
Filipinos are working in Taiwan.  <p>
Jorge Tigno of the Manila-based Institute for Strategic and Development Studies
estimates that there are 300,000 unauthorized Filipinos working in neighboring
East Asian nations, so that illegal Filipino migrant workers in East Asia
outnumber legal migrant workers.<p>

<a name="RTFToC24">Vietnam:
A Changing Picture for Emigrants</a></a>
</a></h2>
Last year, fewer than 100 boat people were reported leaving Vietnam, and 58,000
Vietnamese have since 1989 left refugee camps to return to Vietnam.  A steering
committee for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has declared
that Vietnamese who flee their country will not longer receive automatic
consideration as political refugees, and they would henceforth be treated as
any other asylum-seekers.  This means that the country in which Vietnamese
migrants land can send them home immediately. <p>
About 600,000 "boat people" remain in refugee camps in Asia.  Most are
considered economic refugees and will be returned to Vietnam. <p>
The exception are those in the  Orderly Departure Program, begun in the 1982 .
This is a program for Amerasians and former South Vietnamese officers and
officials  and their families who were held as political prisoners.  About
3,500 people in the Amerasian program will enter  the US by the end of the
Summer 1994, and another 100,000 former political prisoners and their families
are expected over the next two years.  <p>
Once all the Amerasians and political prisoners are dealth with, Vietnamese
will comne to the United States as immigrants, not as refugees. <p>
The United States and its consulate in Hong Kong have been charged in a class
action suit filed on behalf of 250 Vietnamese boat people who are trying to
join their families in the US. The US consulate in Hong Kong stopped processing
visas last fall that allow Vietnamese boat people to reunite with their
families; instead, the Vietnamese had to return to Vietnam and apply for
immigrant visas there.  The suit was filed in a Washington, DC court by Legal
Assistance for Vietnamese Asylum Seekers, a Virginia-based group.<p>
With the normalizing of relations between the United States and Vietnam, there
has been an increased number of Vietnamese abroad returning to Vietnam to
visit; the United Nations estimates that nearly 100,000 Vietnamese return to
visit every year, includiing 20,000 who are expected to return for the lunar
new year this month. <p>
Cambodia has recently seen an influx of Vietnamese to its country, and a senior
parliamentarian there has called for a halt. The Vietnamese Foreign Minister
said that there are fewer than 100,000 Vietnamese nationals living in Cambodia.
The Khmer Rouge claim that there are four million Vietnamese in Cambodia, and
that immigration is part of Vietnam's strategy to colonize its neighbor. The
issue is sensitive because Vietnam occupied Cambodia for a decade after
invading in 1978 to depose the Khmer Rouge. <p>

<a name="RTFToC27">Saudiisation
Expected to Reduce Foreign Worker Employment</a></a>
</a></h2>
Saudi Arabia's Fifth National Development Plan (1990-1995) had as a goal the
substitution of Saudi men and women for foreign workers throughout the economy.
The plan projected that 433,900 Saudis would enter the labor force, and that
there would be 213,500 new jobs created for them. The remaining 220,400 Saudis
were expected to replace foreign workers.<p>
A review of the effectiveness of Saudiisation found that public companies such
as Sabic and Saudi Aramco have most successfully integrated Saudis into their
ranks.  Private Saudi companies reportedly do not have management structures
that foster the integration of young Saudis into their firms, and some hire
only "token" Saudis to avoid compliance problems with the Saudiisation mandate.
However, some managers believe that Saudis are less qualified and demand higher
wages than foreign workers, making it hard to promote voluntary efforts to hire
more Saudis so long as foreign workers are readily available.<p>
Saudi Arabia is stepping up efforts to prevent labor recruiters from obtaining
work visas for workers for whom there are no jobs.  According to Saudi
officials, some labor recruiters obtain work visas for foreign workers who
arrive only to find there are no jobs for them.  These workers then turn to the
daily labor market, or become illegal peddlers.  The Saudis consider such
over-recruitment activities a security threat; foreign workers with such "free
visas" are subject to fine and imprisonment, and their Saudi sponsors must bear
the cost of their deportation. <p>

Cornelius argues that there is a structural dependence on migrant workers in
the US and Japan, as evidenced by the "need" for foreign workers in particular
industries and firms despite recession.  However, in recession, particular
groups of migrants become convenient scapegoats for unemployment and strained
public finances--Iranians in Japan, and Mexicans in the US.  <p>
Cornelius reviews how the debate over immigration's costs and benefits has been
transformed in California into the perception that immigrants generate all
costs and no benefits.  However, he observes that there are significant
benefits to particular firms that often extend to the areas in which those
firms are located; he recounts how an illegal alien interviewed by the police
in Japan discovered that the police knew exactly where he and his friends
lived, suggesting that the police tolerated their presence because they knew
about the local benefits of migrant workers.  The hypocrisy between
tough-sounding state and national demands to reassert control over borders
while permitting side and backdoor migration that is economically useful is
criticized. <p>
During the late 1970s, Cornelius was noted for his belief that most Mexican
migrant workers in the US were sojourners, not settlers.  He has changed his
mind.  The structural need for migrant labor means that, in his opinion,
foreign labor is inevitable, and government leaders should teach the public
that society must " accept as inevitable, a significant incidence of permanent
settlement among the foreigners whom it admits, through whatever channels." (p.

This report draws from over 100 interviews conducted between October 1992 and
May 1993 to explore the effects of and reactions to recent immigrants in
