The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is providing these photos online as part of its 

coverage of the Solar Two dedication. These photos showcase the use of 

energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies at the Solar Two 

installation in Daggett, California. Additional energy 

efficiency and renewable energy technology photos are available online in  

<a href="http://www.nrel.gov/data/pix/pix.html">PIX, the Photographic 

Information eXchange</a>.

<p>

All photos on this page are available for downloading as 200 dpi JPEG's 

(approx. 5"x8", HIGH image quality setting, files download as .zip archives). 

File sizes are listed for each photo. You can also click on the thumbnail 

to see an enlarged 72dpi JPEG image.

   <TD VALIGN=TOP>Sitting atop a tower 300 feet above the desert floor, Solar Two's receiver plays 

   a critical role in solar energy collection.  The receiver was designed by Rockwell International 

   Corporation and built in conjunction with Bechtel Corporation as part of their respective cost-share 

   participation in the Solar Two Consortium.<p>During operation, the sun is focused on the receiver, 

   which consists of pipes coated with a special energy-absorbing paint.  Molten salt flowing through 

   the pipes is heated to 1050 degrees Fahrenheit.  This receiver is one of the engineering advances 

   that is making solar-produced electricity increasingly cost competitive with traditional generating 

   technologies. <a href="ftp://ftp.nrel.gov/pub/pix/sunlab/02185.zip">Download 200dpi JPEG (391K)</a>

   <TD VALIGN=TOP>Solar Two is this country's second pilot power tower.  It begins operation June 5, 

   996, and will produce electricity through January 1999, operated by a consortium of utilities and 

   industrial partners headed by Southern California Edison Company.<p>A power tower produces 

   electricity from sunlight by focussing thousands of sun-tracking mirrors, called heliostats, on 

   a single receiver sitting on top of a tower.  The receiver captures the thermal energy of the sun 

   and stores it in tanks of molten salt (to the right of the tower) at temperatures greater than 1000 

   degrees Fahrenheit.  When electricity is needed, the energy  in the molten salt is used to create 

   steam, which drives a conventional electricity-generating turbine (to the left of the tower).

   <TD VALIGN=TOP>Solar Two generates electricity using energy from the sun; it produces no emissions 

   because it uses no fossil fuels.  Power tower technology can produce utility-scale quantities of 

   power, improve our environmental quality, and reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels.

   <TD VALIGN=TOP>Most of Solar Two's heliostats are large, segmented glass mirrors mounted on frames 

   that track the sun throughout the day, continuously directing solar energy onto the central receiver.  

   Solar Two has more than 1900 heliostats, and taken together, they comprise the plant's largest single 

   component.<p>By collecting solar energy during daylight hours and storing it in hot molten salt, 

   power tower technology gives utilities an alternative method for meeting peak loads.  When demand for 

   electricity is high--for example, during summer afternoons when air conditioning use is heaviest--the 

   stored energy can be used to generate electricity and supply additional power to the utility grid.

   <TD VALIGN=TOP>Solar Two's heliostats direct sunlight onto the receiver throughout the day.  

   The heliostat field captures just a minuscule portion of the solar energy striking the earth, 

   but even this small amount can generate enough electricity to power 10,000 homes.  Solar Two is 

   demonstrating the solar energy--free, abundant, and clean--can reliably and cost-effectively 

   produce electricity on a utility scale. <a href="ftp://ftp.nrel.gov/pub/pix/sunlab/02136.zip">

   <TD VALIGN=TOP>Solar Two represents a milestone in the development of solar energy technology.  

   For the first time, solar energy can be captured and efficiently stored, allowing electricity 

   to be generated when needed, not only when the sun shines.  Except for siting requirements, 

   power tower technology has minimal environmental impact as no fossil fuels are burned in the 

   production of electricity. <a href="ftp://ftp.nrel.gov/pub/pix/sunlab/02162.zip">
