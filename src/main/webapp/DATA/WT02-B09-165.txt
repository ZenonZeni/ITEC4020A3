<h1 align=center><b><font SIZE=+4>Yes on Proposition 215 </font></b></h1>

<center><p><b>by Richard Brookhiser
<br>Senior Editor, <i>National Review</i></b></p></center>

<p>I am a conservative Republican. The only reason I didn't vote for Barry
Goldwater was because I was nine years old at the time. But I started writing
for <i>National Review</i> when I was fourteen. I am for Proposition 215
because of my politics, not in spite of them. But I'm also for medical
marijuana because I've had to use it. </p>

<p>As a political journalist, I mark the milestones of my life by election
cycles. On the eve of Ronald Reagan's election I got married. On the eve
of Bill Clinton's I got testicular cancer. The treatment was straightforward-an
operation, followed by a rather harsh form of chemotherapy. Any chemotherapy
is harsh, because all chemotherapy is poison. You're dumping poison into
your bloodstream, killing millions of cells, in order to kill the thousands
of malignant cells, which will not recover. Because it is poison, the body
wants to get rid of it. That's why, chemotherapy causes nausea. To deal
with this, I took the latest anti-nausea drugs, including Zofran, and I
also did self-hypnosis and mental imaging. These all worked-up to a point.
But beyond that point, I needed extra help, and so I smoked marijuana.
</p>

<p>I had smoked marijuana maybe ten times in college, during the Seventies.
I even inhaled. I stopped because I found I didn't like smoke, or being
high, or the conversation of pot-heads. I turned to it when I got cancer
because marijuana gives people an appetite, and prevents people who are
nauseated from throwing up. None of my doctors or nurses at New York University
Medical Center, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering, discouraged me from doing
this. They had all had patients who had used marijuana to fight nausea,
and who had reported good results. I had good results too. Because of the
marijuana, my last two courses of chemotherapy were almost nausea-free.
</p>

<p>There was only one problem-I had to become a criminal to do this. </p>

<p>Cancer patients are not the only people in this bind. AIDS patients
who have the wasting syndrome report that marijuana gives them an appetite
again. Glaucoma patients find that it arrests the deterioration of their
eyes. People with chronic migraines, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis use
it to relieve their symptoms. But any sick person who wants to use marijuana
to help himself, has to break the law. I'm a member of the media elite,
so I wasn't at high risk. But plenty of sick people get arrested, and plenty
of them go to jail. </p>

<p>There are three common arguments against the medical use of marijuana,
all of them faulty. </p>

<p>The first is that THC, the main active ingredient in the drug, is available
in a legally prescribed pill form. But the pill has problems. It's expensive.
Because it's a pill, and therefore slower acting, people have trouble adjusting
the dosage; they often find themselves taking too much. It all seems to
cause high levels of anxiety and depression. In my case, I thought treating
nausea with a pill was not a bright idea. </p>

<p>The second argument is that smoked marijuana has never been tested scientifically.
This is not entirely true. One test was done at UCLA in 1970 for the Los
Angeles Police Department, which wanted to prove that pot smoking dilated
the pupils. The researchers found that it actually contracted the pupils;
they also discovered that marijuana relieved pressure within the eyeball.
This is why marijuana is useful in treating glaucoma. </p>

<p>But it is true that it is difficult to test marijuana. That is because
the government makes it so. The case of Dr. Donald Abrams at San Francisco
General Hospital is instructive. Dr. Abrams is an AIDS researcher who wants
to test the efficacy of smoked marijuana in treating the wasting syndrome.
For more than two years, he tried to get marijuana legally from the National
Institute on Drug Abuse for his experiments-to no avail. So doctors cannot
prescribe marijuana because it hasn't been tested, but doctors aren't allowed
to do any tests. This is classic Catch-22. </p>

<p>The third objection is that by legalizing medical use of marijuana.,
we will be setting a bad example to a society engaged in a war on drugs.
In fact we will be setting no example at all. The availability of morphine
in hospitals is not the reason people smoke crack. A hairless cancer patient
with an IV tube in his arm is not a come-on for a pusher. </p>

<p>My support for medical marijuana is not a contradiction of my principles,
but an extension of them. I am for law and order. But crime has to be fought
intelligently, and the law disgraces itself when it harasses the sick.
I am for traditional values-I support the Christian Coalition, and I supported
the Moral Majority. But if carrying your beliefs to unjust ends is not
moral, it is philistine. Most important, I believe in getting government
off people's backs. We should include the backs of sick people trying to
help themselves. </p>

<p>My cancer is gone now; I was lucky. God forbid that anyone else should
ever need chemotherapy. But statistics tell us that many of us will. Let
me assure you that, whatever you think now, or however you vote, if that
moment comes to you, you will turn to medical marijuana. Please extend
that liberty to your fellow Californians by voting Yes on Proposition 215.
