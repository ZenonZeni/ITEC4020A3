 How Much of Your Salary Do You Need to Save for Retirement?  </H2><P>
<HR>
Two elements are essential to any savings plan: You must know how much you need, and you must know when you will need it.<P>


For retirement planning, those elements aren't at all easy to figure out, causing many people to throw up their hands and ignore the question entirely.<P>


However, the accompanying worksheet provides a simplified approach that can be used to come up with a reasonable retirement savings plan. There are limitations to the approach, and it is important that you understand those limitations and the assumptions used. The approach is designed to help you determine what percentage of your salary you need to set aside each year so that by retirement, you have accumulated enough savings to generate a desired real (inflation-adjusted) level of income throughout your retirement years.<P>


There are two important concepts you must understand when dealing with time and money. The first is the power of compounding. When money is invested, it produces earnings that can then be reinvested, so that you receive earnings on your earnings in addition to the earnings on your original investment. This added boost is the power of compounding, and the longer the money is invested, the more powerful are its effects. Over long periods of time--20, 30, or 40 years--the effects of compounding at different rates can be substantial. For instance, if you invested $10,000 today you would have $100,626 at the end of 30 years if it earned 8% annually; if it earned 9% you would have $132,676.<P>


You can see the advantages of earning higher returns over long time periods. But you must be very careful when making retirement plans that involve extremely long time periods--small differences in return assumptions can turn into large differences in accumulation. Be conservative in your estimates.<P>


The second important concept concerns the value of a dollar today versus tomorrow. Over time, inflation erodes the worth of money, so that a given amount buys less in the future than it can today. When you are planning for the future, you are examining dollars over numerous time periods. To compare them, you need to put them on an equal purchasing-power footing, so they are all in equivalent dollar terms. In the approach used here, the equal footing will be the purchasing power of today's dollars--that is, dollar amounts will always be stated in terms of today's dollar equivalent.<P>


The worksheet will take you through each step in the retirement savings calculation. The tables at the end of the worksheet provide factors that are used in the worksheet to translate your retirement annuity, your savings growth rate, and your needed annual payment into today's dollars.<P>


Variables you will need to determine to fill out the worksheet are:<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>The number of years you will spend in retirement:</STRONG> The approach here assumes you will use up all of your savings in retirement, so the question boils down to how long you will live after you retire. If you plan to retire at age 65, assume a retirement period of at least a minimum of 20 years, or longer to be more conservative.<P>


<LI><STRONG>The number of years until you retire:</STRONG> The age at which you want to retire minus your current age.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Your total current savings:</STRONG> Savings you have accumulated up until now either in taxable accounts or tax-deferred accounts such as individual retirement accounts or 401(k) plans.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Your desired annual income in retirement:</STRONG> Use your current gross, pretax salary as a guide. Many retirement professionals assume that retirees need about 80% of their pre-retirement salary for retirement income; 100% of your current gross salary is a more conservative estimate. You do not need to adjust your desired income level for inflation; the tables will adjust it for you.<P>


<LI><STRONG>The investment returns you expect on your savings:</STRONG> Your return will be a function of the mix of investments in your savings portfolio. Table 1 presents conservative estimates of returns for several major investment categories, based on historical returns over the past 50 years. If savings are roughly divided evenly between stocks and bonds, your return would be 50% of the return from stocks plus 50% of the return from bonds.<P>
</UL>

Some questions you may have as you go through the worksheet:<P>

<UL>
<LI>How should you treat outside sources of retirement income in your desired annual income figure? You may want to subtract out outside sources of retirement income such as Social Security and any pension benefits from defined benefit plans (contributory plans, such as 401(k)s, should be considered savings); use the annual benefit stated in today's dollars. Estimates on your earned Social Security benefits can be obtained by filling out the Request for Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement (to get a copy, call the Social Security Administration at 800/772-1213 and ask for the form). If you have any pension benefits, your employer's benefits department should provide you with an estimate. Be wary, however, of the Social Security situation, particularly if you will not be receiving benefits for many years. You may want to leave it out.<P>


<LI>How do taxes affect your expected return on savings? If most of your savings are in tax-deferred accounts, such as an individual retirement account or 401(k) plan, your return will be unaffected by taxes. However, if your savings are in taxable accounts, reduce your expected return to account for taxes. Taxes will have less of an impact on certain investments, such as stocks and low turnover stock mutual funds, since most of their return is due to long-term capital gains. The table of return estimates provides rough guidelines for after-tax rates of return for individuals in the 15% and 28% tax brackets, assuming all returns for all categories are taxed annually.<P>


<LI>What if your savings are in both tax-deferred and taxable accounts? Do separate calculations for your taxable and tax-deferred savings, multiplying them by different savings growth factors based on the different return assumptions. Then add them together.<P>


<LI>Will your returns be similar before and after retirement? Some individuals become more conservative after retirement, particularly as assets are drawn down and income and liquidity become more of a concern. On the other hand, it is important to keep some exposure to higher-return equities. You will have to decide what mix of investments you can live with at that stage.<P>


<LI>Should you reduce your return expectations to account for inflation? No. The tables already take inflation into account.
</UL>

The approach used in the worksheet is fairly straightforward, but it makes several assumptions. First, it assumes a 4% rate of inflation. It also assumes that all of your savings will be used up by the end of your retirement period. In the last step, it assumes that your annual salary will grow at the rate of inflation.<P>


You may want to go through the worksheet several times using different variables--for instance, assuming different rates of return in your projections. This will illustrate the impact of these variables on your plans, and may prompt you to rethink some of your assumptions and perhaps even your plans. For instance, it will become clear that the earlier you start saving, the less you need to put aside each year; similarly, the more aggressively you invest (within reason), the less you need to put aside annually.<P>


The approach in the worksheet provides you with an indication of the percentage of your salary that you need to save each year, the most commonly recommended way to save and the method used by many retirement plans, which are usually based on a percentage of one's salary.<P>


However, some individuals may prefer to invest a fixed dollar amount each year, an amount that remains constant--for instance $5,000 each year, unadjusted for inflation. While the worksheet produces an annual savings amount, this is in today's dollars--an inflation-adjusted amount that maintains today's purchasing power; however, in future dollar terms, it increases each year by the inflation rate. If you want to save a fixed dollar amount and still meet your stated retirement goal, the Fixed Annual Savings approach at the very bottom of the worksheet shows you how to do this.<P>


Time plays a major factor in retirement estimates. The effects of compounding over a very long time period can mean big swings in results with only a small difference in assumptions. Use conservative assumptions, but also understand that this planning device only provides a rough guide. Aim for a general savings target, and every few years review your assumptions and try to bring it into better focus.<P>


When you retire, you will have to adjust your lifestyle to your savings, rather than the other way around.<P>

<STRONG>Retirement Savings Worksheet</STRONG>

Use this worksheet, along with Tables 1-4, to help determine how much you need to save for retirement. The guidelines in the text help you determine the appropriate variables in the worksheet and tables.<P>


<STRONG>Retirement Savings Needed:</STRONG>

Multiply your desired annual income in retirement by the Annuity Factor:
