<h2>Ozone Treatment for Cooling Towers</h2>

<p><strong>Overview</strong>
<br>The use of ozone as a maintenance treatment for cooling towers has good potential for operation and
maintenance savings in the Federal sector. A small amount of ozone acts as a powerful biocide that
decreases or nearly eliminates the need to remove quantities of water from the cooling tower in order
to decrease the concentration of organic and mineral solids in the system. Ozone treatment can also
reduce the need for chemical additives to the cooling tower water. 

<p>In a properly installed and operating system, bacterial counts are reduced, with a subsequent
minimization of the buildup of biofilm on heat exchanger surfaces. The resulting reduction in energy use,
increased cooling tower operating efficiency, and reduced maintenance effort provide cost savings as
well as environmental benefit and regulatory compliance with respect to discharge of wastewater from
blowdown. Cooling towers associated with chillers for air-conditioning are good candidates for ozone
application.
