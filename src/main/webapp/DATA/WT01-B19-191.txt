<p align="center"><b>Conservative California Readership Strongly
Supports Medical Marijuana Initiative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 22, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; A
California ballot initiative (Proposition 215) that would permit
patients who have the approval of a licensed physician to use
marijuana for medical purposes received a strong vote of
confidence from the results of a recent poll conducted by the <i>Orange
County Register</i>.&nbsp; Responding to the question: &quot;Do
you think marijuana should be legalized for medicinal use?&quot;
readers answered &quot;yes&quot; by nearly a three to one
margin.&nbsp; In all, over 1,100 Californians participated in the
poll, with 73 percent responding that they approved of the use of
medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The results of the <i>Orange County Register</i> poll are
quite significant because of the widely acknowledged conservative
political slant of the paper's readership,&quot; announced <b>NORML</b>
Deputy Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;These findings,
coupled with the results of similar polls conducted both in
California and nationally, demonstrate that there is ample
support for the legalization of medical marijuana among both
political conservatives and the general public.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The results of the <i>Orange County Register</i> poll are the
latest in a series of polls indicating strong support for medical
marijuana.&nbsp; A 1995 survey conducted by the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) demonstrated that 83 percent of the
American public agreed that patients who find marijuana an
effective therapeutic agent should be able to use it
legally.&nbsp; In addition, six California polls -- including one
conducted by the Binder Research Group -- have shown that a
strong majority of Californians support medical marijuana. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Welfare Reform Bill Amended To Deny
Convicted Drug Users Federal Benefits</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 22, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; An
amendment introduced by Senator Phil Gramm (R-Texas) that would
deny federal assistance-based benefits to those individuals
convicted of drug offenses -- including marijuana misdemeanors --
has been overwhelmingly approved by the Senate.&nbsp; The
amendment is part of an overall welfare reform package (S. 1956)
that is currently in conference committee and is expected to be
sent to the president's desk shortly.&nbsp; It is not yet known
if Clinton will sign the bill. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The amendment proposed by Gramm would deny for five years all
&quot;means-tested&quot; federal benefits, including programs
such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps, and student loans, to any individual
who is found guilty of a minor drug offense.&nbsp; Those found
guilty of drug felonies would be ineligible for life. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If we're serious about our [anti-]drug laws, we ought not
to give people welfare benefits who are violating the nation's
drug laws,&quot; said Gramm. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gramm's amendment struck a chord with some congressmen, including
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) who voiced strong opposition to the
measure. &quot;Under this amendment, if you are a murderer, a
rapist, or a robber, you can get federal funds; but if you are
convicted even for possession of marijuana, you cannot,&quot; he
said.&nbsp; &quot;[This amendment] would undermine the whole notion
of providing drug treatment as an alternative sentence to a
first-time drug offender if the individual requires federal
assistance to obtain the treatment.&nbsp; ... It is overly broad
and is strongly opposed by [both] the [Conference of] Mayors and
the National League of Cities.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Over 10 million individuals have been arrested on
marijuana-related charges since 1965 with nearly one-half million
arrested in 1994 alone,&quot; stated NORML Deputy Director Allen
St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;This amendment could potentially make
millions of otherwise law abiding Americans ineligible for federal
benefits and is yet one more example of how our nation's alleged
'War on Drugs' is nothing more than a war on marijuana
smokers.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The amendment passed by a 75 to 25 vote. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Thousands Expected To Gather On Washington
State Capitol<br>
In Support Of Marijuana Legalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, Olympia, WA:</b>&nbsp; Washington
state marijuana law reform proponents are anticipating a crowd of
thousands to gather on the front steps of the Washington state
capitol for the first ever Hemp Education Day on August 5.&nbsp;
In past years, marijuana reform events such as the Seattle
Hempfest have drawn crowds in excess of 20,000 people. Organizers
of the upcoming festival are hoping to harness the popularity of
past gatherings and transform the Washington hemp reform movement
into a strong political force. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We are aware that in the current political climate, you
can't even discuss [the] issue [of marijuana law reform] publicly
or privately without being singled out in the media as ...
'pro-drug,'&quot; stated event organizer Gideon Israel.&nbsp;
&quot;We must use this opportunity to open up a forum for truth and
free expression on this matter.&nbsp; ... Hemp Education Day will
provide a soapbox for the people of Washington state, lawmakers,
and other citizens to educate and be educated [about]
marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Activists scheduled to speak at the rally include NORML Legal
Committee member Jeffrey Steinborn, Esq., Hemp BC owner Marc
Emery, author Jack Herer, Don Wirtshafter of the Ohio Hempery,
medical marijuana patient Ralph Seeley, and others.&nbsp; The
gathering is planned to take place from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Anti-Drug Ad Called Homophobic By Gay
Watchdog Group</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>July 1996, New York, NY:</b>&nbsp; A recent
public service announcement produced by the Partnership for a
Drug Free America (PDFA) has been branded homophobic by the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), a media watchdog
organization based in New York City. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The ad, scheduled to air nationwide this month, depicts a
teenager named David whose life plummets downhill because of an
addiction to heroin.&nbsp; The ad concludes with the narrator
saying, &quot;And now I have sex with men for money, to support
my habit.&nbsp; ... I wish I didn't have to be like this.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to GLAAD, the ad suggests that drug use ultimately
leads males to engage in homosexual sex and portrays
homosexuality as a social ill more severe than drug use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The spot sends a misguided message to America's young
people and specifically to lesbian and gay youth,&quot; stated
GLAAD managing director William Waybourn.&nbsp; &quot;The ad has
the potential to exacerbate higher-than-average risks gay and
lesbian youths face for substance abuse and suicide by implying
that being gay is worse than being addicted to heroin.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although GLAAD has voiced their objections about the PSA to the
Partnership, PDFA President Richard Bonette responded that he
will not pull the ad. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;While I appreciate your concerns, I simply disagree with
your perspective and, therefore, cannot honor your request to
remove 'David' from distribution,&quot; said Bonette.</p>
