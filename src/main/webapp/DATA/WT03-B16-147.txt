<b>Importing to and exporting from Vietnam is fairly predictable -- once you know the ropes. Following are the paths of two products, one a Hanoi-made girl's parka bound for Germany, the other, an essential industrial chemical manufactured in Tennessee and ordered by a HCMC paint factory. Based on the experiences of the traders, and partly reconstructed with insight from other industry insiders, these examples illustrate the opportunities and challenges of trade in Vietnam.</b><br><p>

<tr><td valign=top><img src="../caps/wcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="W">hile its name might not immediately evoke images of breezy Nantucket summers, state-owned Garment Company 10 is Northern Vietnam's home-grown garment fashion leader, most famous for its top of the line cotton shirts. The 50-year-old company is increasingly reaching for export markets, and several years ago began finding buyers in Japan, South Korea, Europe and Canada, some of whom are now regular customers.<p>

Established in 1946, the state-run enterprise is the largest garment maker outside of HCMC, with 3,200 employees and six factories. It recently bought modern equipment from Japan, Germany and Europe, and is capable of producing 5 million export-quality jackets, shirts, and other clothing. Garment Company 10 has been exporting abroad since the 1970s, when it shipped to eastern European markets. Today the company is one of 1,900 state owned companies licensed to trade. (There are also 6,000 licensed private traders. The majority focus on importing rather than exporting, as profits are higher and quicker.)<p>

The experience of Garment Company 10 in its push to export seems to typify the issues and steps involved, from inception to final purchase.<p>
 
Following is the path taken of one product, a small winter parka made of polyester with a fringed hood, made for a 10-year-old girl living in Munich, and produced by Garment Company 10. Insight partly derives from Ms. Dang Dung Phuong, managing director of Garment Company 10. Ms. Phuong oversees import and export, and her demeanor is a mix of business person, politician, and lawyer.<p>

<b>October 3, 1996</b> The customer, a buyer for German garment brand Seidensticker, anticipates an especially cold winter and would like to introduce an extra 15,000 jackets to the German market in mid-winter. He seeks an overseas garment maker to subcontract the assembly of the jackets. Having worked with Garment Company 10 before, he was satisfied with the company's performance. Says Ms. Phuong of the typical prospective customer, "they want to visit the plant and see it with their eyes. As products are not 100% machine-made, they want to see the skill of the workers, our quality standards, and our working system." This customer did so a few years ago.<p>

The buyer faxes Ms. Phuong and asks whether it is possible for the company to ship the 15,000 jackets by February 1. It would require the import of materials such as textiles, zippers, thread, and trim, the cutting, making, trimming, and packaging of the jackets, then passing them to Seidensticker's shipping agent at the port of Haiphong, 120 kilometers east. He offers a price per jacket, payable by wire transfer upon delivery to Haiphong. She faxes back and offers a tentative yes, but she will confirm within three days.<p>

"Fortunately for<br>Ms. Phuong, she had<br>
anticipated increased<br>demand for winter jackets<br>and had obtained<br>extra quota."<br><br>
</font>
</b>
</center>


In the future, said Ms. Phuong, Garment Company 10 will import, or buy domestically, the raw materials and deliver "CNF" (cost and freight), meaning they would arrange the entire manufacture and transport of the jackets for delivery to the warehouse in Germany. For now, Vietnamese garment makers often only assemble. Producing the entire garment, then arranging shipping and extending credit, could increase their profit three-fold, say industry sources. Garment Company 10 is presently seeking foreign investors for a JV that would manufacture buttons, zippers, and textiles.<p>

<b>October 4</b> Ms. Phuong also anticipated an increase in jacket orders for the winter and recently requested permission to produce a higher number of jackets for the coming year, to a government office that administers quota allocation, since Vietnam has a quota-based trade agreement with the EU (as well as Canada and Norway). Typically a company applying for a quota, done on a yearly basis, receives at least half of its request, unless part of the quota from the year before remained unused. She has not yet heard back from the Hanoi-based quota allocator, called "Import/Export Office of Ministry of Trade." That powerful office, which is based in Hanoi and to which all traders must focus their business around, is administered jointly by the Ministry of Trade and Ministry of Industry.<p>

She calls an official there who deals with garment exports and informs him that she just received an order for 15,000 jackets. This bolsters her application, as he is presently allocating the EU quota, 30% of which is reserved for industrial manufacture such as this job. He tells her to expect her allocation for the coming year to be approved by the end of October. He then permits her to enter into the contract with Seidensticker, so long as she borrows that allocation from the coming year.<p>

While it's a problem that Ms. Phuong says she is fortunate not to have this year as there is a demand for the sort of clothes Garment Company 10 can make, exporters also know that if they haven't drawn orders that at least match their quota allocation by February, the allocation can be reduced. Some traders acknowledge that a secondary market in quota allocations, particularly with jackets, shirts, and quilted fabric, is booming (although illegal) as trade increases. A legal option for an exporter who has received an order that exceeds his quota allocation, but can't arrange more and doesn't want to borrow from the following year, is to subcontract to another garment maker. But that is undesirable, as it doesn't help the primary subcontractor build its business or capacity, nor is it as profitable. Fortunately, Ms. Phuong doesn't have to consider any of these options. She confirms that the production schedule can accommodate the order, then negotiates terms with the buyer and works out a contract.<p>

<b>November 17</b> Textiles, buttons, zippers, and other accessory material shipped from Germany is received by Garment Company 10, having been handled by the customer's freight forwarder, who will also handle the reexport of the finished jackets.<p>
 
<b>December 14, 8:00 a.m.</b> Finished, packaged jackets are loaded into containers and on the road to Port of Haiphong, via manufacturer's drivers. The contract stipulates that Garment Company 10 owns them until they are loaded onto the ship at the port. The slightly increased risk and transportation to the port allows for a slight profit and increased credibility in the eyes of the buyer. In the meantime, Ms. Phuong calls her company's branch in Haiphong and asks them to prepare the paperwork for the Customs Office at the port.<p>

<b>11:00 a.m.</b> The trucks arrive at Customs for inspection. Customs officers check the products at random to confirm that they are as reported and count the cargo.<p>

<b>4:30 p.m.</b> Customs approves of the shipment and seals the cargo with no delay. Shipping documents are signed by the Chief of the Customs Office.<p>

<b>December 15, 8:00 a.m.</b> Containers are loaded onto a "feeder vessel," having been arranged through the customer's forwarder with one of 115 shipping companies with offices in Vietnam (52 domestic and 63 foreign). He chose the vessel largely according to that week's shipping schedules. Quality and price of shipping does not vary much between companies. The Port of Haiphong can accommodate a ship of 7,000 deadweight tons.<p>

<b>December 21</b> The feeder vessel, which also stopped at Port of Saigon for further consolidation of cargo, arrives in Singapore, where the "mother vessel" awaits loading. (The other regional base for mother ships is Hong Kong, two days' sailing time from Haiphong. Some shipping companies only go to one port or the other.) Depending on the need of the customer, goods are sometimes further consolidated in Singapore for further transshipment, although that is more common with imports. The mother ship sails from Singapore to Germany.<p>

<b>January 24</b> Germany. Following customs formalities, cargo is trucked from the port to Seidensticker's warehouse, and a week later ordered by a Munich department store.<p>

<b>February 18</b> Winter in Munich is miserable. Little girl sees Seidensticker jacket with decorated hood and insists that her mother purchase it for her. She goes home wearing the jacket.<p>

While the above is a straightforward process, the quota element is one of the crucial elements that controls companies' growth. This is why some garment makers export as much as half their business to "free quota" countries, which are affected only by tariffs, not quotas, making the items more expensive but possible to import in unlimited quantities, which in some cases is the priority.


<td valign=top><img src="../caps/icap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="I">n contrast to the process negotiated by handlers of exports, the more profitable area of importing products, such as foreign-manufactured consumer, technology, and industrial items, must typically pass through a set of importers, essentially service companies that offer a domestic quota window.<p>

There are certain products which are perceived by Vietnamese traders as quickly-profitable or in urgent demand, such as refined petroleum products, consumables such as cigarettes, some garments and textiles, as well as ingots for domestic steel manufacture, and clinker, needed by domestic cement makers.<p>

One of several impediments those importers face is their ability to pay and under what terms. For many products, payment or a letter of credit is due prior to shipping or upon receipt, neither of which is yet popular with most domestic importers. They prefer "slow-payback schemes," which, according to one Hanoi source, accounted for $1.9 billion in imports in the first nine months of 1996.<p>

Just as fundamental is that some foreign manufacturers do not consider Vietnam receptive to their products, which require aggressive marketing strategies to be employed at their time of entry.<p>

"A principle<br>of their presence<br>is to create<br>market demand,<br>then meet it<br>on behalf of<br>a foreign importer."<br><br>
</font>

</center>

These are opportunities which presumably influenced San Francisco-based Connell Brothers, a trading company with 20 offices throughout Asia, to open an office in Vietnam shortly after the US embargo was lifted in 1994, along with several of their competitors. A principle of their presence is to create market demand, then meet it on behalf of a foreign importer, many steps on the profit chain ahead of Vietnamese exporters, who are more likely to deal with customers who actively sought them.<p>

The trade deficit for 1996 is expected to top $4 billion, considered a priority problem, in part because it drains foreign exchange. Foreign traders like Connell Brothers cannot import or market directly, as their industry is not permitted by current legislation. Instead, such companies operate from representative offices and must act through a chain of Vietnamese agencies, each of which essentially provides one service.<p>

<b>March 7, 1996</b> Connell Bros., seeking products to introduce to the market, identifies a chemicals product called Texanol. Texanol is considered a top-of-the-line "coalescing," or binding agent used in making paint, according to Deac Jones, country manager of Connell Bros., which operates from HCMC. Texanol is among the dozens of industrial and consumer products Connell Bros. is bringing to Vietnam. It is a key chemical that comprises only a fraction of a percent of paint, and is manufactured at a single plant in Kingsport, Tennessee, by Eastman Chemicals.<p>

The market for Texanol is obvious. It is used in small quantities but is a chemical compound required by every paint maker. Vietnam's paint industry is growing to meet the needs of the domestic construction and auto manufacturing sectors. It produced 8,135 tonnes in 1995, 60% more than four years earlier, with per-capita consumption a fraction of neighbors.<p>
 
About 70% of the paint is manufactured by state-owned companies, including high-quality brands such as Dong Nai and Hanoi Synthetic Paint Co. that use modern technology. The Texanol costs about $500 per drum and a container of 80 drums typically lasts a Vietnamese paint manufacturer about a year.<p>

Connell's first step in importing is to identify the possible demand then establish the relationship with Texanol's makers.<p>

"Simultaneously,<br>the company<br>is training sales agents<br>of one or more<br>of twelve Vietnamese<br>distribution companies<br>with which it works,<br>so that they, too,<br>can sell and<br>distribute Texanol."<br><br>
</font>
</b>
</center>

<b>June 1</b> Connell Bros. and Eastman agree to cooperate, and now Connell in HCMC must work to create the actual demand. Connell technicians and chemical engineers meet with local companies to explain what the product is, why it is worth buying and how to use it. Those sales people build relationships with their counterparts at the plants and receive orders for Texanol. Simultaneously, the company is training sales agents of one or more of twelve Vietnamese distribution companies with which it works, so that they, too, can sell and distribute Texanol. "We have to find a Vietnamese partner to share our interest in promoting the product," says Jones. Connell sends a purchase order to Eastman for the exact amount of Texanol needed. It is arranged through Connell's San Francisco headquarters, which gives the manufacturer "a large comfort level," says Jones.<p>

<b>June 16</b> Two containers of Texanol are shipped by Eastman to San Francisco Bay. Once consolidated, the vessel sails to Singapore, taking 28 to 35 days, where it is unconsolidated and loaded onto various feeder vessels by forwarders. The HCMC-bound vessel, possibly arranged by a Vietnamese freight forwarder, carries the containers of Texanol. Shipping costs for one 20-foot container from San Francisco to HCMC are about $1,600.<p>

<b>July 20</b> The Texanol docks at the Port of Saigon. Prior to the sale, Jones engaged a Vietnamese state-owned import company to facilitate the shipment. That company, one of several thousand, was selected on the basis of its quota allowance for this chemical compound. Because a similar chemical is not produced in Vietnam and is needed for domestic industry, tariffs are low. Other products, like paint, for example, are subject to import-substitution duties, which act to restrict or prohibit imports that would compete with domestically-made products. This system is resented by foreign manufacturers but highly appreciated by foreign joint-ventures, some of whom have undoubtedly established a presence here in part because of that protection. Customs officers inspect the cargo. They check the contract between the import company and Connell, as well as between the paint factories who ordered the Texanol and the import company, or Connell's designated distributor. Import fees and port charges are paid and the containers are loaded onto trucks.<p>

<b>July 22</b> The trucks bring the Texanol to the importer's warehouse in HCMC. At this point, the import company is technically the owner of the goods, even though Connell either paid for them or bought them with credit. "There is no risk for the manufacturer," says Jones. The disadvantage of a scenario where the trading company does not legally own the goods, while perhaps not as essential for a large firm like Connell Bros., is that they cannot be presented to a bank as collateral. Also, if a buyer or distributor defaults to the trading company responsible for remitting payment in foreign currency (to Connell's Singapore or San Francisco office), the foreign trader has little legal recourse.<p>

<center>
<b>
<font size=+1 font color=3D6D92>
"Also, note some<br>in the industry,<br>the import company<br>in many cases<br>will warehouse the cargo<br>at no charge.<br>This is a major bonus<br>for traders,<br>especially with<br>consignment-based shipments,<br>who are accustomed<br>to large warehousing fees<br>in other markets."<br><br>
</font>
</b>
</center>

Theoretically, the Government's action in that case is to withdraw the trading company's license. On the other hand, the import company does fall under a ministry and is subject to a chain of command. Not a bad position from which to convince the local buyer to make good. Also, note some in the industry, the import company in many cases will warehouse the cargo at no charge. This is a major bonus for traders, especially with consignment-based shipments, who are accustomed to large warehousing fees in other markets. However, lacking the ability to warehouse goods directly severely limits the products and level of service a trading company can offer to local customers.<p>

<b>July 27</b> The Texanol is purchased by the paint factory, which pays the import company, which in turn remits the payment, minus a 1-5% commission based on the total value of the cargo, to Connell's Singapore or San Francisco office.<p>

As with others in the industry, Connell Bros. plays a major role in introducing products to the Vietnamese market that are being recognized as essential, from plastics, codeines, and textiles to personal care products. Jones argues that companies like his play a unique role in building the local service industry and providing the manufacturing industry with necessary products, at its own risk. He also notes that Connell Bros. also facilitates exports, most recently tapioca starch, rubber, and spices. With regulations designed to keep the volume of consumer item imports low enough to correspond to exports, this point is a strong one for freer trade.
