<h3 ALIGN=CENTER>Providing an Appropriate Education to Children with
Attention Deficit Disorder</h3>
<p><b>
ERIC Digest, October 1992<br>
#E512</b>

<h3>Clarification of Terms</h3>
<p>
Throughout this digest, ADD will be used to refer to attention deficit
disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In the past,
the term minimal brain dysfunction  was also used.
<h3>Children with ADD</h3>
<p>
It is estimated that children with ADD constitute 3% to 5% of the
current school-age population, which would represent 1.35 to 2.25
million children. Most experts agree that ADD is a neurobiological
disorder that can have multiple causes. Research indicates that children
with ADD are likely to have a biological relative with ADD. In addition,
evidence also suggests that neurologic, neurochemical or, in some
cases, toxic factors may be involved. Other factors such as medical
conditions, medication side effects, familial functioning, or
environmental conditions may exacerbate an existing disorder or
contribute to the development of ADD-like problem in some children
(Parker, 1992).

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<p>
As with all other disabling conditions, evaluation of children suspected
of having ADD should be a multistep, multidisciplinary procedure. First
the assessment should determine whether a child meets criteria for
diagnosis of ADD; then, further assessment should determine the
degree to which the child's educational performance is adversely
affected. This information will help determine what types of educational
services are necessary to assist the student.
<p>
The first step requires gathering information about the child from a
number of sources and in a variety of ways. Medical information; parent
or guardian descriptions of the child's physical, mental, social, and
emotional development; school information; descriptions of social
behavior and classroom adjustment; and assessment of the child's
cognitive functioning are essential to making an accurate diagnosis.
Because the behavior of children thought to have ADD can vary widely
in different situations and environments, experts recommend obtaining
information from many sources, and observing the child in different
settings and at different times. Evaluations of children suspected of
having ADD often include rating scales completed by parents and
teachers.

<h3>School Responsibilities</h3>
<p>
Schools must provide appropriate educational services to students who
have been identified as having ADD. In September 1991, the
Department of Education issued a policy clarification on the topic of
children with attention deficit disorder (Davila, Williams, & MacDonalt,
1991). The memorandum was intended to clarify  state and local
responsibility under federal law for meeting the needs of children with
ADD in the educational system as a whole.
<p>
The responsibility for meeting the educational needs of children with
ADD rests with the entire educational! system, not just with particular
sectors. Thus, if the needs of these children are to be fully met in the
schools (whether through general or special education programs), 
increased coordination, collaboration, and consultation will have to
occur among regular educators, special educators, administrators. and
related services personnel. The report recognizes that:
<p>
Regular classroom teachers are important in identifying appropriate
educational adaptations and interventions for many children with
ADD.
<p>
State and local districts should take the necessary steps to promote
coordination between special education and regular education
programs.
<p>
Regular education teachers and other personnel need training to
develop a greater awareness of children with ADD and of adaptations
that can be implemented in regular education programs to address the
instructional needs of these children.
<p>
Children who are experiencing educational difficulties, whether from
ADD or some other cause, often fail to receive any assistance until after
difficulties, such as distractibility, disorganization, or inability to complete
assignments on time, have caused them yo fall significantly behind their
classmates. By the time children have experienced such failure, they
generally have already lost a great deal of academic ground In addition,
school failure may contribute to, or worsen, a student's feelings of low
self-esteem, depression, or anxiety.

<h3>Federal Laws Affecting Children with ADD</h3>
<p>
Both the Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provide coverage for children with
ADD. When the disability adversely affects educational performance,
eligibility for special education should be approached through the
processes of IDEA When the disability does not affect educational
performance but does substantially limit one or more major life
activities, eligibility should be approached through Section 504. The
following are highlights of each law as it affects the education of
children with ADD.

<p>
<b>Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part B:</b>
<ul>
   <li> Requires that state and local districts make a free appropriate
     public education (FAPE) available to all eligible children
     <br>
   <li> Requires that the rights and protections of Part B of IDEA
     are extended to children with ADD and their parents.
     <br>
  <li> Requires that an evaluation be done, without undue delay, to
     determine if the child has one or more of 13 specified disabling
     conditions and requires special education and related services.
     <br>
  <li> Requires that children with ADD be classified as eligible for
     services under the "other health impaired" category in instances
     where ADD is a chronic or acute health problem that results in
     limited alertness that adversely affects a child's educational
     performance. Children with ADD can also be served under the
     categories of "learning disabilities" or seriously emotionally
     disturbed," if the evaluation finds these conditions are also
     present.
     <br>
  <li> Does not allow local districts to refuse to evaluate the possible
     need for special education and related services of a child with a
     prior medical diagnosis of ADD solely by reason of that medical
     diagnosis. On the other hand, a medical diagnosis of ADD does
     not automatically make a child eligible for services under Part B
     (IDEA).
     <br>
  <li> Requires that a full and individual evaluation of the child's     
     educational needs must be conducted in accordance with
     requirements in Part B (IDEA). These requirements include:<br>
    <dl>
       <dd>A multidiscipiinary team must perform the evaluation.
           At least one teacher or other specialist with knowledge
           in the area of ADD must be on the team.<br>
    </dl>
  <li> Requires that a due process hearing take place, at the request
     of the parents, if there is disagreement between the local district
     and the parent over the request for evaluation, the evaluation, or
     the determinations for services.
  </ul>

<p>
<b>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973:</b>
<ul>
   <li> Prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of
     federal funds.
     <br>
   <li> Provides appropriate education for children who do not fall within
     the disability categories specified in Part B (IDEA).  Examples of
     potential conditions not typically covered under Part B (IDEA) are:
     <br>
     <dl>
        <dd>communicable diseases (HIV, tuberculosis)
            medical conditions (asthma, allergies, diabetes, heart
            disease) temporary medical conditions due to illness or accident
            drug/alcohol addiction<br>
        </dd>
     </dl>
   <li> Requires that a free appropriate public education be provided to
     each qualified child who is disabled but does not require special
     education and related services under Part B (IDEA). A free
     appropriate education (FAPE) under Section 504 includes:
     <br>
     <dl>
         <dd>Regular or special education and related aids and services
             that are designed to meet the individual student's needs and
             are based on adherence to the regulatory requirements on
             education setting, evaluation, placement, and procedural
             safeguards.<br>
         </dd>
     </dl>
  <li> Guarantees parents the right to contest the outcome of an
     evaluation if a local district determines that a child is not
     disabled under Section 504.
     <br>
  <li> Requires the local district to make an individualized determination
     of the child's educational needs for regular or special education or
     related aids and services if the child is found eligible under
     Section 504.
     <br>
  <li> Requires the implementation of an individualized education
     program (IEP). One means of meeting the free appropriate public
     education requirements of Section 504 is to follow the IEP
     guidelines as set forth in the regulations for Part B (IDEA).
     <br>
  <li> Requires that the child's education must be provided in the regular
     education classroom unless it is demonstrated that education in
     the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and
     services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.
     <br>
  <li> Requires that necessary adjustments be made in the regular
     classroom for children who qualify under Section 504.
</ul>
