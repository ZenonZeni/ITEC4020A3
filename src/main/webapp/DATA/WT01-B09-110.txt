<B>Project Title: Reliability and Containment System Testing for Flywheels<p>
Performing Organization: Rocketdyne/Rockwell Corporation</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Terry Lorier  (818) 586-1129</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>Rocketdyne/Rockwell has developed a low-cost titanium flywheel, with a unique rotor design which allows the flywheel to fail in a very safe mode.  This project will conduct safety and containment testing on this flywheel, to determine the reliability of the containment structure, designed to safely manage the dissipation of the flywheel's kinetic energy during failure.</P>

<P>The Rocketdyne flywheel design incorporates some unique safety features into a 1.0 kWh unit.  The principal advantage is that the rotational inertia of the flywheel is fractured in a very predictable manner, with minimal energy release.  The Rocketdyne design allows only the rim mass energy to be released upon failure, with this energy absorbed by the containment ring structure made of ultra-strong steel alloys which minimizes the cost of the flywheel system.</P>

<P>In this program, Rocketdyne will build a scaled containment ring and housing, will install it on the flywheel unit, and will conduct fully-instrumented destruction testing to verify the predicted failure mode and containment.  The flywheel rotor and system will then be rebuilt to its original configuration at the end of this test project.</P>

<P><B>Milestone</B>s</P>

<P>This program is just beginning, and will last for twelve months.  The flywheel containment ring will be designed and fabricated by the sixth month of the project, with full speed testing beginning in month 9.</P>
