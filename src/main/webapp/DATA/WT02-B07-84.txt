<TITLE>FBI Director Freeh 11/2 Letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Hyde</TITLE>
</head>
<BODY>
<p>
<p>
November 2, 1995
<P>
Honorable Henry Hyde<BR>
Chairman<BR>
Committee on the Judiciary<BR>
House of Representatives<BR>
Washington, D.C.  20515<P>

Dear Mr. Chairman:<P>

          An article published today in <EM>The New York Times</EM>
states that the "FBI wants advanced system to vastly increase
wiretapping."  That simply is not so.<P> 

          Court-ordered wiretapping is the single most effective
investigative technique used by law enforcement to combat illegal
drugs, terrorism, violent crime, espionage and organized crime. 
The majority of wiretapping is conducted by state and local law
enforcement.  Last year there were 1,154 wiretap court orders
nationwide for all of law enforcement but these court-ordered
wiretaps are critical to saving lives and solving the very worst
crimes suffered by the public.  Moreover, that number is not
expected to increase in any significant manner when the law
already passed by Congress is fully implemented.<P>

          Congress last year overwhelmingly passed legislation to
preserve this ability in the face of advancing technology.  The
law neither expands authority nor ability, it merely maintains
the status quo, that is, only maintains the ability of law
enforcement to conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance. 
Without this, the public safety would be severely jeopardized.<P>


The simple facts are:
<UL>
<LI>Congress last year did not expand the FBI's authority to conduct
wiretaps nor did the FBI ask Congress to do so.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The FBI and the telephone industry are working together -- as the
law Congress passed last year requires -- to find reasonable and affordable
solutions in the face of advancing technology. The initial public request
for comment is part of that process.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>We have not and are not asking for the ability to
               monitor one out of every 100 telephone lines or
               any other ridiculous number like that.  To obtain
               that many court orders and conduct that extent of
               wiretapping would be nearly impossible.  
Information supplied by the FBI was simply applied in
               a manner not intended to reach erroneous
               conclusions.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Without this law, adequate funding and reasonable
               technical solutions, the Nation's public safety
               and national security are unquestionably
               jeopardized.  Merely maintaining without expanding
    the ability of law enforcement to conduct court-ordered wiretaps is the single most important
               problem law enforcement faces today.
</UL>

          The new law requires the FBI, on behalf of all of law
enforcement, to work with the telephone industry to identify
technical design requirements for industry to build into their
systems.  The public notice mentioned in <EM>The Times</EM> article is
part of that process and we are working with the telephone
industry to define workable requirements and reasonable
capacities.<P>

Deputy Attorney General Gorelick said this morning:
"Let me make it perfectly clear, there is no intention to expand
the number of wiretaps or the extent of wiretapping."  Those who
are using the public comment notice to argue to the contrary are
wrong.
<P>
Sincerely yours,
<P>

Louis J. Freeh<BR>
Director
