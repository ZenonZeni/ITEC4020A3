<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Thermal Evaluation of Electrosource Horizon Battery<p>
Performing Organization:  Electrosource, Inc.</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Steve Addington (512) 445­6606</P>


<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>It is known that heat flux and thermal gradients during charging and discharging under various ambient conditions affect battery capacity. Controlled sources of external heating or cooling can create more uniform temperatures within a battery pack, leading to more consistently available capacity.</P> 

<P>A thermal evaluation of the Electrosource Horizon battery will be conducted to identify the parameters which need to be considered when designing a thermal
management system. The project goal is to better characterize and quantify these parameters, through empirical measurements and evaluation, to aid the development of thermal management systems which will optimize performance and battery life at a reasonable cost.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>
<P>Battery Calorimeter­ To quantify thermal design parameters, precise measurements of temperature difference must be made. The first task of the project will: </P>
<UL>
<P>design, build, calibrate and demonstrate a battery calorimeter capable of measuring heat released or absorbed by batteries under charge and discharge conditions at different test temperatures.  </P>
</UL>
<P>Data Collection on Test Batteries ­ Battery modules will be temperature soaked prior to testing at a reference temperature and at three different test temperatures. Data to include: </P>

<UL>
<LI>internal and external temperatures of the battery;
<LI>heat transfer under charging; 
<LI>heat transfer under fixed current discharging. </UL>

     <P><B>Resistive Heating Evaluation: </B></P>

<P>a heating element will be chosen and positioned under the test battery based on the results of earlier testing. </P>

<P>the battery calorimeter will be utilized to simulate an insulated vehicle battery tray of known heat transfer characteristics. </P>

<P>testing will be performed at two charge rates and two discharge rates to assess heating element impact on temperature uniformity.</P>

<P>Final Recommendations Report ­ A final report will be generated at the conclusion of this task to describe the tests, discuss the results, and provide recommendations for design of thermal management systems. </P>

<P>A resistive heating design will be implemented in conjunction with the battery pack testing being performed at the Sacramento Consortium Battery Test Facility.</P> 

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P><P>This ten­month project will provide and quantitative thermal
parameters to aid the development of thermal management systems.
