<h2>Independent press in Cuba struggles to stay alive<BR>
</h2>
By Suzanne Bilello<br>
<P>
A few days before World Press Freedom Day <br>(May 3), nine Cuban security police ransacked the modest Havana offices of the Independent Cuban Press Bureau, a struggling nongovernment news agency. They hauled away almost the entire contents--two typewriters, an antiquated word processor, files and books, even the pens and pencils.<P>

Joaquin Torres, a journalist with the Havana Press independent news agency there, termed it "a reminder that they are there, and they can silence us whenever they like."<P>

Cuba stands alone in the hemisphere as the only country that tolerates no independent newspapers, magazines or news broadcasts. That brings frequent U.S. criticism in international human rights forums; it earned Fidel Castro a spot on CPJ&#146;s enemies list of world leaders who pose the gravest threat to press freedom.<P>

Under increased international scrutiny and sorely in need of economic partners, Cuba is poised for historic change. Whether the transition is to democracy hinges in part on whether Cuba has a free press that gives its citizens the basis for informed decisions about how they want to be governed.<P>

Castro no doubt knows that in many countries, the transition to democracy began when individuals reported what anyone could see, but few had dared to say.<P>

And whether the United States continues to see Cuba as a nondemocratic menace to national and hemispheric security has far-reaching implications for how Washington is using your tax dollars.<P>

Only a year ago, four upstart news agencies were founded in Havana. Since then, many of their journalists have endured waves of harassment.        Several were detained on charges ranging from "dangerousness" and "disrespect" to spreading "enemy propaganda."<P>

Many of those journalists worked for government media until they were sacked for "ideological incompatibility" and now are trying to eke out a living free-lancing for foreign news organizations. Their aim is to carve out a livelihood that is independent of state-controlled media yet a comfortable distance from organized dissident factions at home and abroad.<P>

Paradoxically, the United States has become an unlikely ally in Castro&#146;s efforts to justify keeping independent journalists isolated and vulnerable, subject to the whims of the state and cut off from potential foreign patrons.<P>

The anti-Cuba Libertad Act sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., and signed by President Clinton, includes troubling provisions that in effect prohibit U.S. news organizations from sending resident correspondents to Cuba--even if Castro were to welcome them. It requires that Cuban authorities grant resident work permits not only to correspondents from private U.S. news organizations but also to employees of the U.S. government&#146;s Radio and TV Marti service, the principal broadcast medium for Castro&#146;s most     bitter enemies among U.S. exiles.<P>

If a U.S. news organization wants     to hire Torres or other Cuban journalists   on retainer, as       a few have, the    U.S. Treasury Department has to approve the transaction. This practice--tantamount to licensing, prohibited here by     the First Amendment--puts Cuban journalists in the precarious position of needing official U.S. approval to work there.<P>

Castro remains the chief obstacle to freedom in Cuba for local and foreign journalists alike. But the U.S. government&#146;s meddling with press freedom and personnel decisions by U.S. media could set a troubling precedent for U.S. regulation of news media--U.S. or foreign--elsewhere. <P>

While policy-makers in Washington posture about the threat of a Communist Cuba, Torres and other independent journalists will spend this World Press Freedom Day much like any other: straining to hear telephone conversations through the echoes of wiretaps, scrounging for pens and paper and worrying that  if three journalists get together to talk, they could be charged with "delinquent association." <P>
