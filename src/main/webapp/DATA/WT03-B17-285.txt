Subject: night crawlers

Could you please give me some advice on how I can get rid of night
crawlers. My yard is full of them, they are creating hard mounds
everwhere in my lawn, it is raised and uneven making it difficult to
mow or even walk on. Please give me some ideas. I live in Medicine
Hat Alberta, our soil is mostly clay, the weather is very hot and dry here.
It seems that my neighbor has had them for years but didn't know what
was causing the mounds in her yard now they have moved into our yard.
 Thanks for any help you can give me.

This is a bit unusual in that most people want earthworms especially
the type that you have. the environment you describe is not one thats
perfect for these worms, does it rain alot? any way here are a few
suggestions, choose one which you can do.
1..start an earthworm farm! people will pay you lots of money for them!
either there or thru the mail!
2..people will also pay you for their manure. Its called earthgworm
castings and they are a prized organic fertilizer. those mounds are
really mounds of this earthworm casting. Bag and sell it.
3..spread the mound evenly over the lawn.
4..take mounds and feed gardens, roses, trees.
5..to remove worms pour boiling hot water over ground , do for several
days in a row, then do as needed.
does this help?
may i suggest that you join our club?
please see web site for info..page called about us.
$55 life time. free book"Natural Pest Control" written by me, etc....
yours
