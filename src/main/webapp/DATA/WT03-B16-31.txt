<h4>April 1996<hr></h4>

<h2><a name="ia">INTERNATIONAL</A></H2>
<h4>Responding to the EU Works Council Directive</h4>
<p>Time is rapidly running out for multinational companies with European operations to establish works councils, in line with the EU's 1994 Works Council Directive. The Directive must be implemented into the national laws of member states by 22 September this year. The Directive is designed to give European employees of multinational organisations a greater voice in their companies' business decisions.
<p>Here are the answers to some common questions our multinational clients are asking.
<p><b>Which companies are affected?</b> The Directive applies to all multinational organisations with a combined total of at least 1,000 employees in the following EU countries and at least 150 employees in each of two of these countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
<p>The UK is not currently among this group, having exercised its long-standing right to opt out of EU employment policies. This does not mean that British companies are exempt from the Directive. It simply means that UK employees aren't counted in determining whether an organisation is subject to the Directive and need not be included in any works council arrangements. Thus, for now, a multinational company with, say, 5,000 employees in the UK and 2,000 in Germany would not be subject to the new consultation requirement, while a company with 850 employees in Germany and 150 in France would be covered.
<p><b>What does the Directive require?</b> Multinational organisations subject to the Directive will be required to establish appropriate arrangements for formal consultations with employee representatives (if employees exercise their right to request such arrangements). This has been a priority for the European trade unions for many years. They view the Directive as a way to recruit new members, increase their influence and play a role in determining how multinational organisations manage their resources in Europe.
<p>Employers can, however, shape the way the works councils are formed and operate. The Directive gives companies three broad alternatives:
<ul>
<li>They can develop a voluntary agreement with employee representatives before September 1996. This offers companies maximum flexibility, giving management and employee representatives wide latitude to develop a framework that meets their mutual objectives.
<li>They can negotiate voluntary agreements within the terms of the Directive after September 1996. This preserves some management flexibility but requires compliance with formal standards spelled out in the Directive.
<li>Finally, they can wait until September 1999 and create a model works council according to highly detailed standards, outlined in the annexe to the Directive, which afford little management flexibility.
</ul>
<p>Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages, and no one approach will be right for every company. However, all companies need to decide on their approach as soon as possible.

<h4>Compulsory membership of pension funds survives challenge</h4>
<p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that compulsory membership of supplementary benefit plans for particular professions does not contravene EU law. The case involved a Dutch physiotherapist who did not want to become a member of the supplementary pension plan that compulsorily covered employees in his profession. He claimed that compulsory membership contravened the EU principle of free competition.
<p>Although this decision clarifies the issue of compulsory membership of a professional fund, the question of compulsory participation in an industry-wide fund still remains open. Such funds  are prevalent in countries such   as Finland, France, Germany  and the Netherlands. 
<p>Further information: Val Vardy, London, (44) (171) 379 4411
<h4><A name="eu2">Pensions portability suffers setback</a></h4>
<p>The European Commission has postponed a decision on draft legislation covering cross-border transfers of supplementary pensions. The matter has now been referred to a working party that is examining barriers to workers moving freely within the EU. The group has six months in which to decide whether EU legislation is appropriate.
<p>Although state pension schemes are already co-ordinated within the Union, approximately half of the EU's workers also have private or company pensions to supplement their state provision. If these workers move from one EU state to another, they significantly reduce their supplementary entitlement.

<h4>Mandatory earnings-related pension plan changed</h4>
<p>The mandatory employers' earnings-related pension plan (the TEL plan) was changed with effect from 1 January 1996. The changes are intended to encourage employees not to retire before the age of 65.
<p>Previously, employees receiving a disability pension, an early retirement pension or an unemployment pension accrued a retirement pension at the rate of 1.5% per year (at the same rate as those in employment), payable at age 65.
<p>Under the new rules, the rate of accrual for a retirement pension for these categories is:
<ul>
<li>1.5% per year to age 50
<li>1.2% per year between ages 50 and 60
<li>0.8% per year between ages 60 and 65.
</ul>
<p>The basis for calculating pensionable salary under TEL has also been changed, but this will be phased in gradually between 1996 and 2005. Before 1 January 1996, it was based on average earnings during the last four years. In future, it will be based on the average salary over the last ten years of service.

<h4>Additional costs imposed on private group insurance plans</h4>
<p>With effect from 1 February 1996, employers and works councils have to pay a new 6% tax on any part of the premiums they pay for private group insurance plans. For their part, employees have to pay the new 'social debt reimbursement contribution' of 0.5% on that part of the premium paid by the employer. Employers should therefore review the impact of these additional costs and decide, if necessary, on a plan of action.
<p>In January 1996, the daily fee that has to be paid by anyone being hospitalised was increased from FF55 a day to FF70 a day. Private medical plans either reimburse, fully or partially, such fees or do not reimburse them at all. Employers that provide full reimbursement need to decide if the private plan should take the full increase, and if so, how the extra cost should be apportioned.
<p>In the light of these new costs, employers should identify the true costs of operating private plans and may wish to consider cost controls by:
<ul>
<li>gradually modifying benefits that are 'inflationary' and cause plan deficits
<li>discussing the issues with their employees and reaching consensus about a plan of action.
</ul>

<h4>Compulsory retirement benefit system to be introduced</h4>
<p>Employers should evaluate the potential impact of the proposed Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) system that is expected to be fully operational by 1998. The Government is currently finalising the rules and regulations that will govern MPF plans. This process is expected to be complete by early to mid 1997.
<p>The MPF system represents a major change to retirement provision that currently consists only of voluntary employer-sponsored plans. The MPF will have far-reaching benefit design and cost implications for employers. Its key features are:
<ul>
<li>Contributions will be made by both employers (5%) and employees (5%), based on total earnings (limited to  HK$20,000 per month).  Employees earning less than HK$4,000 per month will have the option of not contributing.
<li>Each employer may choose  to either set up its own MPF scheme or contribute to a master trust.
<li>The MPF schemes must be defined contribution.
<li>Benefits must be fully vested ie employees are immediately entitled to all the contributions made by their employer. In addition, they must be fully preserved ie held within an MPF scheme until the employee:
<ul>
<li>reaches age 65
<li>reaches age 60 and retires
<li>dies
<li> becomes permanently disabled
<li>permanently leaves Hong Kong
<li> Expatriates will be excluded from the MPF.

<h2><a name="it">ITALY</A></H2>
<h4>Competencies research completed</h4>
<p>A competencies research study conducted by Towers Perrin in Italy on behalf of INDICOD, the Institute for Consumer Goods Ventures, has examined the competencies required for sales roles in Italian manufacturing companies and purchasing roles in distribution companies.
<p>INDICOD, the research sponsor, is an association of 18,000 Italian companies that together represent all sectors of the consumer goods market. The study was based on data gathered from a significant sample of INDICOD's members.
<p>The study highlighted the following features of human resource management systems:
<ul>
<li>External recruitment is as frequent as internal promotion.
<li>Formal performance appraisal is not particularly important to an individual's career progression.
<li>Training courses - both internal and external - are a significant element in salesforce development.
<li>There is an increasing emphasis on incentive systems.
</ul>
<p>The most interesting findings regarding competencies are:
<ul>
	<li>Competencies are differentiated by roles and not by strategies or businesses.
	<li>Respondents identified common competencies for sales in general and managerial roles in sales; these are, respectively:
	<ul>
		<li> a knowledge of the business, its products and its distribution system
		<li> communication skills, motivational skills and leadership.
	</ul>
	<li> Competencies that need to be developed in the future are:
	<ul>
		<li>customer service orientation
		<li>teamwork and co-ordination
		<li>planning and analytical skills
		<li>open-mindedness
		<li>knowledge of the competitive marketplace
		<li>merchandising
		<li>knowledge of how distribution companies are organised.

<h2><a name="jp">JAPAN</A></H2>
<h4> Flex plans given a boost </h4>
<p>Flex plans are expected to take root and grow rapidly now that  a major tax obstacle has been removed. The obstacle was potential 'constructive receipt' tax treatment of all employee benefits if an employee could choose from a flex menu of benefits, some of which would normally be non-taxable by concession.
<p>An official newsletter recently issued by the National Tax Bureau states that, even if such flex benefit options are available, the selection opportunity should not, of itself, trigger constructive receipt. This official tax opinion removes a major tax uncertainty and is a big step forward in favour of flex.
<p>The tax bureau has already applied this new tax treatment to the first two flex plans in Japan, one of which was established in 1995, and the other one earlier this year.
<p>More companies will follow suit. Although employee benefit plans in Japan are relatively comprehensive, traditional plans have major weaknesses, including:

<ul>
<li> incompatibility with the changing workforce structure and employee needs
<li> lack of employee understanding and appreciation
<li>poor cost-effectiveness and increasing cost burden
<li>plan designs often mismatched with corporate objectives.
</ul>
<p>A flex plan can resolve these problems and be much more attractive to existing and new employees.

<h2><a name="mx">MEXICO</A></H2>
<h4> Social security system overhauled </h4>
<p>Companies with operations in Mexico will need to review their employee benefit strategy in the light of social security reforms that will come into force in 1997. The reforms will affect retirement benefits, health and welfare benefits and workers' compensation. They are designed to strengthen the financing of the social security system, improve the minimum level of benefits and enhance benefit equity, and also encourage Mexican working people to save more of their income.
<p>Key features of the reforms are:
<p>Retirement benefits
<ul>
<li> Benefits formerly provided from a defined benefit pension programme, a defined contribution programme (SAR) and a special housing programme (INFONAVIT) will be consolidated into a single employee retirement account
<li>These new accounts will be financed by a combination of voluntary employee contributions and mandatory con-tributions from employees, employers and the government.
<li>Contributions must be invested with special retirement fund administration companies (AFORES). At retirement, employees must use their account balances to purchase life annuities from an insurance company or the AFORES.
<li>Social security disability pensions will be set at 35% of the average covered salary during the last 500 weeks of covered employment, indexed according to inflation.
</ul>
<p>Health and maternity benefits
<ul><li> The funding of health and maternity benefits will be   separated and their financing methods changed, through the creation of a new family insurance (voluntary affiliation).</ul>
<p>Workers' compensation
<ul><li>Companies' individual claims experience and level of risk, rather than industry claims experience as previously, will be taken into account in the assessment of company contributions.</ul>

<h4>Sickness Benefits Act abolished</h4>
<p>From 1 March 1996, most of the statutory sickness benefits under the Sickness Benefits Act (ZW) will no longer be payable. Instead, employers will be required to pay employees on sick leave 70% of their salary, up to a ceiling set for 1996 at Dfls 75,583 for a maximum of one year. Employers will be able to fully or partially insure themselves against that risk. Currently, employers are only responsible for paying sick employees 70% of their salaries for a period of two weeks (small companies) or six weeks (large companies).
<p>The current ZW contribution rate will be abolished. To finance the remaining ZW benefits, contributions to the Unemployment Benefits Act (WW) will be increased.

<h2><a name="za">SOUTH AFRICA</A></H2>
<h4> Tax changes affect employee benefit plans </h4>
<p>Employers may wish to review the design and asset strategy of their employee benefit plans, following the tax changes announced in the budget on 13 March 1996. The budget broadly endorsed the proposals of the Katz Commission (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9602.html#za">February</a> 1996) concerning:
<ul>
<li>consistent tax treatment of private and public sector funds
<li>tax neutrality between forms of retirement provision (pension, provident and retirement annuity funds)
<li>an incentive in favour of a 	lifetime annuity (pension) as opposed to lump sums  
<li>taxation of income as it arises rather than when it is paid out.
</ul>

<p>Implementation of the budget proposals will, for the most part, be delayed for at least a year. However, immediate tax changes are being imposed on the assets of retirement plans that will no longer be totally tax-exempt. A tax of 17% will be charged on gross interest and net rental income. This tax will affect all pension, provident and retirement annuity funds (including state and semi-state funds). 	Special provisions will apply in respect of the portion of rental and interest income attributable to assets funding the liabilities of existing pensioners, and in respect of retirement plans where rental and interest income-bearing assets comprise more than 50% of the total market value of the assets of the plan.
<p>The taxation of benefits in terms of the Katz Commission proposals will not be implemented until 1 March 1997 at the earliest. The vested rights of public sector employees will be entrenched, and the new provisions will be phased in over a period of five years for private sector employees.

<h2><a name="es">SPAIN</A></H2>
<h4>Popular Party proposes economic reform</h4>
<p>On 3 March 1996, the conservative Popular Party won the election, ousting the Socialists who had governed Spain for the last 13 years. The party did not gain an absolute majority in the lower house, as had been forecast by most polls. It is 19 seats short and will therefore have to depend on support from the nationalist and regional parties who have 25 seats between them. It remains to be seen how much of the Popular Party's economic programme, summarised below, will be implemented. It is, in any case, unlikely that the new Government will, in the short-term, make any meaningful changes to the Insurance Law passed in November 1995 (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9512.html#es">December</a> 1995). Companies should therefore evaluate the effect of that legislation on their pension arrangements, rather than wait and see how the economic programme fares.
<p>The following is a summary of the economic programme.
<p><b>Pensions</b>
<p>The Toledo Pact (agreed to by the major political parties in 1994 to ensure the long-term viability of the social security system) is to be implemented. However, experts believe that the Pact will prove insufficient. Its key measures are:
<ul>
<li>separate financing of contributory and non-contributory pensions
<li>unification of all social security categories under a single contributory earnings ceiling
<li> integration of the special social security regimes (mining, agriculture etc) into the general system
<li>continuation of the pay-as-you-go basis of funding
<li>maintenance of the maximum pension
<li>continuation of indexation of pensions in line with consumer price 
<li>increasing the averaging period for pensionable earnings
<li>encouragement of flexible approaches to retirement
<li>encouragement of private supplementary retirement provision, probably by tax incentives
<li>ensuring a proportionate relationship between contributions paid and benefits received by employees
<li>improvement in the management and control of the social security system, particularly as regards fraud.
</ul>
<p><b>Employment</b>
<ul>
<li>establishment of a social pact between the government, unions and employers 
<li>introduction of more incentives for the self-employed and those working in small- and medium-sized companies.
</ul>
<p><b>Personal income tax</b>
<ul>
<li>simplification of tax scale and reduction in top marginal rate from 56% to 40%, as finances permit (the Catalan Party is only committed to a reduction to 48%, so the Government will need to negotiate)
<li>reduction in capital gains tax and wealth tax
<li>introduction of more favourable tax treatment of housing.
</ul>
<p><b>Corporate income tax</b>
<ul>
<li>depreciation schedules to be improved
<li>double taxation of dividends to be eliminated.
</ul>

<h4>Social security cash benefits reduced </h4>
<p>Some social security cash benefits - including sick pay and parental pay - were reduced by approximately 10% with effect from 1 January 1996.
<p><b>Sick pay.</b> The revised levels of sick pay are as follows:
<p>Day 1	0%<br>
Days 2-14	75% (paid by the employer)<br>
Day 14 onwards	75% (paid by social security)
<p>Most employers top-up sick pay to a maximum of 85% (the legal maximum additional contribution) until day 90. They do so either because of a relevant collective agreement or because they wish to offer competitive benefits. Similarly, employers usually also provide sick pay for earnings that exceed the social benefit ceiling of SEK271,500.
<p><b>Parental pay.</b> Social security provides parental pay during leave to look after a child for a maximum of 450 days after the birth of that child. The leave may be taken at any time during the first eight years after the birth, but before the end of the first school year. With effect from 1 January 1996, the rates are as follows:
<table>
<tr><td>First 300 days<td>75% of ordinary pay (previously 80%) paid to either parent<br>
<tr><td>30 days<td>	85% (previously 90%) paid to the mother only<br>
<tr><td>30 days<td>	85% (previously 90%) paid to the father only<br>
<tr><td>90 days<td>	SEK60 per day (unchanged) paid to either parent
</table>

<h4>Court ruling confirms exclusion of pension rights from Acquired Rights Directive</h4>
<p>The High Court has confirmed that employers do not need to provide pension arrangements for staff who are acquired as a result of a business transfer.
<p>The case (Adams v Lancashire County Council and BET Catering Services Ltd) was brought by three trade unions on behalf of 11 part-time female council employees who lost their pension rights when their jobs were transferred to the private sector. The Court ruled that the council had not contravened EU law by not ensuring that the women's pension rights were transferred to their new employment and that the UK's Transfer of Undertakings Regulations correctly implement the EU's Acquired Rights Directive.
<p>The ruling makes clear that pensions are excluded from the Acquired Rights Directive and that EU member states are only required to protect pension contributions accrued up to the date of the transfer of a business.

<h4><a name="uk2">Pension splitting on divorce moves forward</a></h4>
<p>The House of Lords has amended the Family Law Bill to allow the value of occupational pension benefits to be split at the time of divorce in a similar manner to other matrimonial assets. This could involve payment of a transfer value to an individual arrangement. The Government has stated that it will attempt to reverse this amendment.
<p>The Pensions Act 1995 already contains provision for 'deferred maintenance' where a portion of a member's benefit is earmarked for the ex-spouse on divorce.  When divorced members draw their pension, the earmarked portion is paid to their ex-spouse.
<p>The provisions in the Family Law Bill are in addition to those in the Pensions Act; whatever happens, it is likely that schemes will have to comply with the earmarking provisions of the Pensions Act for some time before any new proposals can become effective.

<h4><a name="uk3">Challenge to Working Time Directive defeated</a></h4>
<p>The UK Government has failed in its attempt to have the Working Time Directive declared unlawful on the grounds that an inappropriate legal basis (health and 	safety) was used for its adoption. The November 1993 Directive regulates the maximum working week (48 hours), shift patterns and annual holidays throughout the EU. The UK had argued that such matters were a question of social policy.
<p>On 12 March 1996, Advocate-General Philippe Leger issued an Opinion that the Directive had been adopted on the correct legal basis. If the European Court of Justice (ECJ) endorses this Opinion in a full ruling expected in the summer, the Directive will be confirmed. The UK Government has already stated that it will apply none of the Directive's provisions until the ECJ has ruled. Other member states have either already implemented the Directive or are in the process of doing so before this autumn's deadline.

<h4>Health care costs remain in check in 1996</h4>
<p>Despite a slight increase in the average rate of employer health care cost growth, employers generally are seeing another year of moderate increases in the cost of employee and retiree health benefits in 1996, according to Towers Perrin's seventh annual health care cost survey. The survey confirms the important role that managed health care delivery systems, such as health maintenance organisations (HMOs), are playing in US companies' ongoing efforts to control the growth of health care costs - especially with regard to coverage for Medicare-eligible (ie age 65 and older) retirees.
<p>Towers Perrin's recently completed 1996 Health Care Cost Survey of more than 150 large employers found the per capita cost of employee coverage under non-HMO plans increasing at a rate of about 4% on average this year, up from about 2% in 1995. For HMOs, the average employer's cost continues to decline - by about 1% for active employees this year (2% in 1995). On a composite basis, taking into account both employee and retiree coverage, HMO and non-HMO plans and all levels of coverage (eg employee-only, family), the average employer will pay about 3% more per capita for health care this year than last.

<h4><a name="us2">New guidance clarifies line between investment 'education' and 'advice'</a></h4>
<p>Ever since the advent of 401(k) and other retirement plans that let participants direct how their money is invested, most employers have recognized the need to encourage employees to save for retirement. At the same time, however, many employers have been hesitant to provide extensive information about investing those savings out of fear that they could be considered 'investment advisers' under US law - with fiduciary liability for any losses participants might suffer from relying on such information.
<p>Recently, the US Department of Labor (DOL) issued long-awaited guidance that goes far toward easing employers' fears by clarifying the line between investment 'education' and the more closely regulated realm of investment 'advice'. The new guidance specifies four types of investment-related information that employers can provide without worrying that they might be exposing themselves to fiduciary liability in the DOL's view.
<p>The DOL guidance offers added comfort to employers who want to take a more proactive approach to educating employees about their retirement savings programmes, plan investment options and the basics of saving and investing for the long term. It also may require minor adjustments in some employers' current plan communication materials.

<h4><a name="us3">Companies moving away from pensions for outside directors</a></h4>
<p>Retirement arrangements for outside corporate directors have come under increasing scrutiny within the past year or so, spurred by growing concern that pensions may be an inappropriate form of compensation for non-employees whose role is to look out for shareholder interests. It seems that scrutiny has now given way to action.
<p>Among the 44 large companies participating in a new Towers Perrin CompScan survey, for example, fully half have already terminated their pension plans for outside directors or are planning to in the very near future (in many cases, before they issue their 1996 proxy statements). In eliminating defined benefit pensions for their directors, most of these companies are moving to unfunded deferred compensation accounts denominated in company stock to make up the lost benefits.
