<b>Polyhydride Complexes for Hydrogen Storage;<br>

<P>
In an alternate class of metal hydrides, called nonclassical polyhydride 
metal complexes, hydrogen binds to the metal center of the complex while 
still retaining much of the 
hydrogen-hydrogen bond.  As a result, these complexes desorb the bonded 
hydrogen under 
mild conditions (i.e., there is no need to use extreme temperatures or 
pressures when recovering the hydrogen for use).  In this work, we are 
attempting to produce new nonclassical polyhydride complexes that contain 
large amounts of available hydrogen.  We have already demonstrated that 
the hydrogen-release characteristics of these complexes can be fine-tuned 
by making small changes in the composition of the complex.

Reversible dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane to toluene in the 
presence 
of platinum group metals has long been considered as a potential hydrogen 
storage 
system.  But because the dehydrogenation occurs at high temperatures 
(300F,186C), these systems had been precluded from practical 
consideration.  We have 
found, however, that polyhydride complexes and their precursors catalyze 
the 
reversible dehydrogenation of cycloalkanes under mild conditions.  Thus 
it appears 
that a cyclic system is available.
