VOLKSWAGEN JOINS THE RACE FOR FIRST COMMERCIALLY VIABLE ELECTRIC CAR

Volkswagen AG has plans to unleash an electric vehicle
called the Chico car by the end of 1993.

The company has just developed a computerized system that will
greatly assist in mass producing the vehicle.  Volkswagen hopes that
the Chico will put it in the front-running position of the newly
developing electric car market.

ITALIAN CHEMICAL CO. INTRODUCES NEW, CLEANER DIESEL FUEL

Diesel-Bi is the name of a clean diesel fuel produced in part from
vegetable oils and methanol.  An Italian company, Novamont, based in
Milan and a subsidiary of the Ferruzzi-Montedison Group, will begin
field testing the fuel this month in South Dakota.

The company has worked closely for two years with Senator Thomas
Daschle (D-SD) who hosted a March 28 ceremony to inaugurate the field
tests.  A company spokesman said Ferruzzi is seeking eventual EPA
approval of the product so that it can be commercially sold in the
U.S.  Testing will take place in the EPA-certified laboratory in
Sioux Falls, and data from these tests along with other company tests
will be compared to 1993 and '94 clean diesel emissions standards
adopted in California.

Diesel-Bi is made of 90 percent vegetable oil and 10 percent methanol
that is "combined in the presence of a catalyst to produce a methyl
ester," a company official said.  Ethanol could be used, but methanol
is preferred by the company as more price competitive.

Palm, sunflower, soya and other oils can be used to produce
Diesel-Bi.  In Europe, canola is the feedstock most commonly used.
Some test results have shown that sulphur emissions have been
eliminated and particulates and carbon monoxide have been reduced up
to 50 percent.  The fuel can also be used in combination with
traditional diesel fuel.

Ferruzzi began his work on Diesel-Bi about two years ago and held the
first field tests in Zurich last summer.  Two buses in Sioux Falls
are scheduled to operate solely on the fuel for four months.

CHINA MOVES TOWARD VISION OF GIANT HYDRO DAM, DISPLACING 1.3 MILLION

The dream of damming the flood-prone Yangtze, which captivated Mao
Zedong in the 50's, is moving toward realization.

Everything about the project is enormous.  It will generate 84
billion kilowatts of hydroelectric power per year by 2008.  The l85-
meter-high dam will be the biggest hydropower station in the world,
as well as the world's largest ship-lift.  The price: an estimated
$l0.5 billion.

But the human cost will be equally enormous.  Some 1.3 million people
will be displaced from 140 towns (some with populations of over
l00,000) and countless villages.  Also lost will be 58,800 acres of
arable land, 159 smaller power stations, and 675 factories.

Resistance is so strong, particularly from small farmers, that a
third of the deputies to the National People's Congress, usually a
rubber-stamping body for government decisions, voted against it.

Adding to the tension is an inequality of benefits.  Sichuan
province, with 85 percent of the people to be displaced, stands to
receive only l0 percent of the power generated.  It will also face a
heightened risk of flooding.

Critics worry about the risk of the reservoir, induced earthquakes
and river bank collapses.  They also contend that the rapid
accumulation of silt will wipe out much of the gains in generating
capacity.

The dam will be financed through bonds, preferential foreign loans,
state funds, and power generation (expected to start nine years after
construction is begun).

LOS ANGELES SET TO ADD 150 MEGA-WATT GEOTHERMAL COMPLEX

Los Angeles joins the China Lake Naval Weapons Center at Coso, CA in
tapping local geothermal energy. The Los Angeles Department of Water
& Power (DWP) has awarded a contract for a nearby 150-megawatt power
complex to Calpine Corporation, which built the Navy's plant there
five years ago.

The Los Angeles DWP will lease a site from the Weapons Center, 200
miles north of the city.  Calpine, builder of both plants, also
maintains and operates the Navy's geothermal facility.

No figures have been divulged, but observers estimate the cost at
about $200 million.
