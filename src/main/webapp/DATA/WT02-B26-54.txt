<H2>The Efficacy Of Schizophrenia Treatment</H2>
 <HR>

	The Efficacy of Schizophrenia Treatment, published by NAMI in November 1995, documents the effectiveness of existing schizophrenia treatments.  Co-authors Laura Lee Hall, Ph.D., director of research at NAMI, and Tami L. Mark, Ph.D., a senior research director at Project Hope examine data from the most rigorous reviews of randomized controlled trials of schizophrenia treatment.  The data show that medications and psychosocial interventions--such as skills training, intensive case management, and supported employment--reduce symptoms, relapse, and hospitalization and improve functioning, quality of life, employment status, and satisfaction.
<P>	"People with schizophrenia and their family members can find hope in these data," said Dr. Hall.  "Treatments that work for many individuals with this severe brain disorder do exist.  These data showing the effectiveness of schizophrenia treatments and supports provide an overwhelming rationale for the end of insurance discrimination based on the false notion that there is no effective treatment for schizophrenia.  Furthermore, effectiveness data should increase access to treatment by informing the delivery and financing of care for people with schizophrenia.  For example, these data can serve as the scientific foundation for managed care organizations to match effective and necessary treatment to those who need it."
<P>	The Efficacy of Schizophrenia Treatment is available from NAMI's Resource Distribution and Sales (RDS) department for $5.00.  Ask for publication #R325.
