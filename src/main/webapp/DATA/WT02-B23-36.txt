CONFLUENCE TECHNOLOGIES, INC. LAUNCHES AUTOMATED FEED OF MUTUAL
FUND NET ASSETS VALUES TO NASDAQ 
</CENTER>
</H2>

<P>
<STRONG>PITTSBURGH, Pa. - December 4, 1995</STRONG><B> - </B>Confluence
Technologies, software developer for the mutual fund and trust
industries, today announced the introduction of NAVFeed, an automated
interface to Nasdaq. NAVFeed allows mutual fund companies to transmit
their end-of-day prices (NAVs) to the stock market without manually
rekeying fund information on Nasdaq workstations, both reducing
reporting errors and ensuring that prices arrive on time. Inaugurating
this service with the San Francisco-based Ameristock Mutual Fund,
Confluence becomes the first and only third-party company to deliver
a stand-alone automated solution to the industry. Originally developed
as an extension of its flagship software product, FundStation,
Confluence now plans to offer NAVFeed as both a stand-alone product
and as a service bureau that receives price information over the
Internet.
<P>
Currently, most fund service companies transmit end-of-day prices
to Nasdaq for publication in daily newspapers by manually entering
them on Nasdaq terminals. &quot;The unique feature of Confluence's
service is that it accommodates every level of fund service provider,&quot;
says Service Bureau Director, Kirk Botula. &quot;The largest companies
can transmit their numbers over a direct leased line, while the
smallest can route their information through the Service Bureau.
Clients can tailor the way they send their information to Nasdaq.&quot;
<P>
Ameristock Director, Nicholas Gerber, is enthusiastic about the
new service. &quot;Confluence enables us to compete with larger
fund complexes, because the service they offer is flexible and
affordable. The only alternative to the Service Bureau for smaller
funds is the hassle of sending NAVs and other fund information
manually. &quot;
<P>
Confluence President, Michael Schiller agrees, &quot;NAVFeed provides
the foundation for complete automation of information distribution
at all levels of the industry.&quot;
<P>
Kirk Botula adds, &quot;We are providing real value to our users
who pass their data through the Service Bureau. We will soon calculate
performance reports and deliver daily fund profiles to key clients
via fax, email, data transfer, and the World Wide Web.&quot;
<P>
