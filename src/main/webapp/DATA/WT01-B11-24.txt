<H2> Yamaha Prototype 73-75 </H2>

almost produced in 1975.  Engine was mounted transversely.  It had
combination side and peripheral intake ports.  Charge cooled rotors.

<H2> Suzuki RE-5 1975-77 </H2>

<P> The <A HREF = "suzuki.html">Suzuki RE-5</A> was powered by a 498 cc
single rotor water cooled engine.  It was first shown in 1973 at the
Tokyo show.  The first model year was 1975 and it was produced for three
model years.  The instrument panel and tail light were contained in
cylindrical shapes to play on the rotary theme.

<H2> Van Veen OCR 76-78 </H2>

<P> Dutch importer Henk van Veen grafted either a <A HREF =
"mazda.html">Mazda</A> sports car engine (10A?) or a Comotor <A HREF =

kg).  Top speed 130 mph.  Price &#163;5000.  996 cc, 4 speed gearbox,

<P> Malcolm Forbes <A HREF =
"http://www1.playboy.com/apr79/interview4.html">got one</A> in 1978.
True to rotary form, he took it up to 130 mph before he looked at the
speedometer and thought better of it.
