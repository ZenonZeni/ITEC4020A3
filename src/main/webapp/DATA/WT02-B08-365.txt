<h2 align=center> Robbing the Cradle: Parents as Teachers  </h2>
<h3 align=center> by Brannon Howse  </h3>
<blockquote> Parents as Teachers. Sounds like a good idea. But is it? Laura Rogers, former researcher with the Moore Foundation, has grave doubts and says the "Parents as Teachers" educational program that has been introduced in at least forty states and eight countries, "....will result in state control of the children and reduce parents to the status of breeders and supervised custodians."
<p> Laura Rogers, a mother of six and founder of the St. Charles Christian School in St. Charles Missouri, which she has operated for twenty years, ought to know. As a lobbyist for the Missouri home school law-which has been used a model nationally-Laura has appeared on the "Today Show," "Point of View," and other programs discussing her Christian School and research related to home schooling and the "Parents as Teachers" program.
<p> Goal number one of the eight national goals of Goals 2000 allows for the implementation of early childhood intervention programs such as "Parents as Teachers" and states: "All children will start school ready to learn." Although this sounds valid, it is a smoke screen hiding the true mission of America 2000.
<p> According to Phyllis Schlafly, president and founder of the pro-family group, Eagle Forum, "The first goal of Goals 2000 to deal with children before they enter school is extremely ominous." She particularly finds the Parents as Teachers Program "extremely objectionable."
<p> Why? Because, as Mrs. Schlafly points our, "Parents as Teachers should be called Teachers as Parents. Schools are trying to substitute as parents and take over the raising of the children from infancy-something the government and the schools have no competence to do."
<p> On page 29, of the original America 2000 legislation, the statement is made.
<p> "Increased attention will be focused on adult behavior, responsibility for children and family, and community values essential for strong schools. This includes involving parents as teachers of their children and as school partners."
<p> Implemented by Missouri in 1981, this program was supposed to help avert a rising drop-out rate and increase parental support of the educational system. In 1985, the Missouri legislature passed a resolution "offering" - which means requiring - all 543 school districts in Missouri the Parents as Teachers program.
<p> Based on a study conducted by nationally renowned child development expert, Dr. Burton White, who served as a consultant to the four pilot projects launched in 1981, this program does not encourage parents to be teachers of their children. The real purpose is to teach parents how to parent according to the standards set by the program.
<p>  <b> GET'EM EARLY  </b>
<br> Legislation to provide funding for "early intervention" programs such as "Parents as Teachers" was introduced as U.S. Senate Bill 1134, on May 22, 1991, and later tabled. It is still waiting to be reintroduced.
<p> Although at this time "Parents as Teachers" is not a national program, it has been implemented in many states by their departments of education. Introduced on January 11, 1991, the pending Congressional Bill called, HR 520, would make "Parents as Teachers" a national program. It also has been temporarily tabled.
<p> The bill states, "Most early childhood programs begin at age three or four when remediation may already be necessary." Remediation from what? Three years of parental love, guidance, and supervision?
<p> Although the program is currently voluntary, it could become mandatory if parents are not made aware of pending legislation and do not take the necessary action.
<p> How does the program work? A family volunteers for what is presented as education and health screening to ensure that their child begins school healthy and ready to learn. If the child is not ready, the program also assures the parents that the school will help that child learn by meeting his or her individual needs.
<p> Although presented as a voluntary program, once parents enlist, they have a hard time opting out without harassment from "parents educators." If parents refuse to stay in the program or do not follow their advisor's instructions, the advisor will threaten to contact local child protection services to have the child removed from the home. Several documented cases have show that after a family has dropped out of the program, within a few days, a social worker shows up at the child's home.
<p> Surely, that can't happen in America. Yet I have talked to numerous creditable family advocates who have confirmed that such harassment definitely takes place.
<p>  <b> PARENTS AND CHILDREN AT RISK  </b>
<br> The original House Bill defines the "parent educator" as "a person hired by the lead agency of a state or designated by local entities who administers group meeting, home visits and developmental screening...." In order for the states to continue to receive federal grants for this program, there would have to be, "a minimum of four group meetings and eight home visits for each participating family."
<p> Laura Rogers makes this observation:
<br> "A 'parent educator' bonds herself to a family through home visits or school visits in order to help parents feel more comfortable about leaving their child(ren) at the center. Both parents and children are evaluated under the guise of educational screening."
<p> In Missouri where "Parents As Teachers" (PAT) has its start, measures were taken to protect family confidentiality. Home educators are not permitted to share with anyone the information they collect during their visits. Yet, Missouri's open records law grants public access to any of the PAT documents. So much for confidentiality!
<p> Laura Rogers makes another startling revelation about what the "parent educator" determines from her visit:
<p> "Their child is given a personal computer code number by which he can be traced the rest of his life. There are twelve computer code definitions which label the child "at risk." Since the expectation is that every child will be found "mentally ill," there is no code for normal."
<p> Why would every pre-school child be considered mentally ill? Dr. Pierce, a promoter of Goals 2000, provides the answer.
<p> "Every child who enters school at the age of five is mentally ill because he comes to school with allegiance toward our elected officials, toward our founding fathers, toward our institutions, toward the preservation of this form of government, patriotism, nationalism, sovereignty....all of that proves that the children are sick, because a truly well individual is one who has rejected all of those things and is what I would call the true international child of the future."
<p> Does that give you a clue as to what these "educators" have up their sleeves? They want to re-program your child's mind and beliefs to their way of thinking.
<p>  <b> HOW "SICK" IS YOUR CHILD?  </b>
<br> Who determines, how sick your child is? The power to label your child "at risk" belongs to the friendly "home educator" who visits your house regularly and makes notes about every aspect of your life.
<p> What kind of training does a person in such a responsible position receive? Only one week-a mere thirty hours- is all that is required to make them "experts" on parenting and evaluators of your child's future.
<p> What criteria does the "home educator" use to assess your child? There are the twelve "at risk" codes. See where you, and your child, and your family fit in:
<ul>
 <li> Premature babies, emergency delivery, or birth trauma.
 <li> A child's slow growth, poor appetite, or frequent illness.
 <li> Delayed development. (By whose definition is this measured?)
 <li> Inability of parents to cope with inappropriate child behavior, including spanking as exclusive form of discipline, and inconsistency.
 <li> A parent who is ill, heavy, tired, depressed, handicapped, injured, or appears to be of low level intelligence.
 <li> Overindulgence, undue spoiling on part of parent.
 <li> Stress on the family, such as a parent that travels frequently, moving to a new home, a death in the family, divorce or separation, birth of a sibling, three children under the age of three, prolonged illness, loss of a job, low level income.
 <li> Allergies, heavy cigarette smoking in the house, family history of hearing loss, lack of stimulation or over stimulation, predominantly inappropriate or very few toys.
<p>  <b> CRADLE TO COLLEGE  </b>
<br> What is the real purpose of the "home educator"?
<p> Yale psychologist, Edward Zigler, calls home visitation programs run by government authorities, "an essential part of my vision of the school of the twenty-first century." That vision calls for parents to turn over primary care of infants to home- based day care providers (after taking a short-term post-birth job leave). These home day care providers would be linked to the public school system, which also would offer school-based day care for children age three and four as well as before and after-school care for school aged children and a variety of other social services directed to children. Thus Zigler's school of the twenty- first century hopes largely to supplant the role of parents from "cradle to College."
<p> They want your children. It's as simple as that. Of course, they approach it under the guise of helping parents parent their children. But what kinds of families does the PAT program target?
<p> Were the PAT program targeted only to families with a proven track record of dysfunction (families of divorce, domestic violence, illegitimacy, ect.), then this "parental inadequacy assumption" might be justified. Given, however, that the program is intended to be a "preventative" program geared to ordinary families, this assumption is pernicious and has a counterproductive effect. Moreover, there is little research evidence to suggest that home visitation contributes meaningfully to positive development outcomes. In fact, a 1988 study of an experimental mother-child program found that home visitation did not improve parenting skill or child development.
<p> If home visitation doesn't work and homes they target don't need help anyway, why are the educators pushing the PAT program? Remember, it's the first goal of Goals 2000. Here's an idea of what they have in mind.
<p> Lamar Alexander, former U.S. Secretary of Education for the Bush administration promoted what was then called America 2000. Lamar Alexander proclaimed that schools need to be open from six in the morning till six at night, supply children with all three meals, and provide the necessary social services. Mr. Alexander said he felt that even babies should be in school!
<p> You can see that the educational elite are out of touch with reality and have lost all rational judgement when it comes to the true purpose and function of education. They consider schools to be factories where children-considered property of the state-are put on a classroom conveyer belt and molded into little liberal robots.
<p> What would be the result of such a homeless climate? According to Bob Morrision of the Family Research Council, recently history provides the answer:
<p> "Marxist states sought more control over childrearing via institutional day care and other policies that separated children from their parents and grandparents. We see today in the fouled environments of Eastern Europe and Russia, in the corrosive ethnic hatreds that boil below the surface of socialist fraternity, and in the rotting, outmoded industrial plants of the Eastern Bloc the fruits of a policy that ignored the rights of parents and that treated religious moral beliefs as subversive of the state."
<p> "That could never happen in America," you say? Let's hope not, but many parents and educators are alarmed at the direction our government is taking.
<p>  <b> MEDICATION AND VACCINATIONS  </b>
<br> Do you have a hyper-active child? If so, read this section carefully.
<p> There have been reports of "home-educators" recommending that parents with supposedly hyper-active children see a doctor and receive a prescription of Ridalin-a potentially addictive drug. Parents who followed the home educator's instructions, but who later refused to give Ridalin to their children, were reported -by the "home educator" -to child protection services.
<p> Katie Soffin, a researcher on "Parents as Teachers" and Outcome-Based Education wanted to find out if such reports were true. As the director of "PAT Answers" and a staff writer with the Kansas City Christian Newspaper, Mrs. Soffin conducted the following interview.
<p> In November of 1991, I called the child abuse hotline to find out further details on how they handled reports and if they handled reports from parent educators. They told me they did. I asked if a "parent educator" were to recommend that a parent see a doctor to prescribe Ridalin, and the parent saw the doctor, was given a prescription, but refused to give Ridalin to their child, would the parent educator call the child abuse hotline? They replied, "Yes."
<p> "What happens with the report from there?" I asked. They replied, "The case is given to a social worker who then contacts the parent educator and the physician. The three of them decide whether or not to deliver an ultimatum to the parent to either give their child Ridalin or the child will be removed from the home."
<p> I could not believe what they told me.
<p> In Missouri and several states, parent educators or state agents are required by law to report individuals who do not comply with "recommended" services. Failure by a state employee to report noncompliance is a class A misdemeanor, punishable by one thousand dollars and/or one year in jail.
<p> To make matters worse, the Clinton Administration has unveiled its aggressive strategy to track every child in the U.S. How do they do that? By providing age-appropriate immunizations for every child. This goal of assuring vaccinations for all American Children against childhood diseases, however, includes a questionable plan to register and track all children and families by their Social Security numbers.
<p> Many responsible parents are concerned that this bill will threaten family privacy. Meanwhile, Clinton sent a letter to those participating in the homosexual march in Washington a few years ago, lauding the group's aims, which included continuing anonymous and only voluntary HIV testing. Healthy children would be tracked by our government, but adults with a lethal, transmissible disease will remain anonymous.
<p> Health and Human Services Secretary, Donna Shalala, told Congress that President Clinton plans to buy up all U.S. vaccine production and dispense it "free" to all American children.
<p> That statement raises questions every parent should be asking: Does that mean the government will have a monopoly on all available vaccines? What will happen to those parents who refuse to participate in the government immunization program? Will they be considered child abusers? Will someone from child protection services show up at their house with a threat to comply or risk losing their children?
<p> Such a scenario is not beyond our imagination in light of what has been happening in the Parents as Teachers program.
<p>  <b> IT'S THE MONEY!  </b>
<br> Why is the Parents as Teachers program so popular with individuals in both parties? Because they receive federal money for developing early childhood prevention programs. The more "at Risk" children they have, the more money they receive. Governors are also told in the Goals 2000 legislation that they will receive national recognition and funding for implementing this early childhood intervention program.
<p> If "Parents as Teachers" was geared toward helping families with problems because of divorce, drugs, alcohol abuse, and or child abuse, I could see the legitimacy of such a program. But PAT is a voluntary program. What dysfunctional family would invite a home educator into their home to evaluate them?
<p> Most of the families involved in this program are good parents who care about their children. Why else would they have volunteered for a program that was marketed as "health and educational screening" to prepare their child for school? Would an irresponsible parent enlist in such a program? Of course not!
<p> The pushers of PAT know that, but their main goal is to get into homes and control how parents are raising their kids regardless of their needs or what kind of parents they find.
<p> Where will the "Parents as Teachers" program eventually lead us? To the licensing of parents, as William B. Maxwell, an attorney from Oklahoma, has recommended. Parents may one day be forced to go through parenting training before receiving a marriage license or before being permitted to enroll a child in school.
<p> What happens if you don't meet their criteria as a qualified parent? I think you know what the answer.
<p> The time to act is now. We cannot wait until the PAT program become a nationally mandated program with the hidden agenda of abducting our children from the safety and security of their own homes.
