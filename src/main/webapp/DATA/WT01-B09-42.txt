	<p>CALSTART's partnership with DARPA is pushing forward a range of technology projects to meet the next level of key power and performance goals required not just for military vehicles, but commercial vehicles as well.</p>


<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-2b.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-2a.gif"></a><center><b>The Joint Tactical Electric Vehicle (JTEV) will be used to test high-risk components for a new military hybrid reconaissance vehicle.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>




	<p>CALSTART continues the rapid pace of advanced vehicle and technology development.  Within the last year, we placed the nation's first fully integrated hybrid buses at Vandenberg Air Force Base, developed advanced turbogenerators to serve as the main power generators for hybrid vehicles, and installed a multi-vehicle charging kiosk at a transit station in Northern California.  </p>

	<p>This year, CALSTART's partnership with DARPA is pushing forward a range of technology projects to meet the next level of key power and performance goals required not just for military vehicles, but commercial vehicles as well.  CALSTART was particularly successful in advancing flywheel and auxiliary power unit (APU) technologies and hybrid-electric electronics components in the latest round of DARPA-partnered projects.</p>

<p><h3 align><FONT COLOR=#808080>The CALSTART Mission</FONT></h3></p>


	<p>CALSTART's core mission is a broad one: to create a new advanced transportation industry, bringing with it cleaner air and high quality jobs.  As a critical component of this effort, we focus our DARPA programs on advancing electric and hybrid-electric vehicle technologies to meet military and commercial needs. To make this happen, CALSTART acts as an advanced transportation industry "solution provider" that quickly taps its network of more than 185 participating companies and organizations to obtain the resources needed for custom-made, market-oriented solutions to technology barriers.  CALSTART provides these services to the advanced transportation industry:

<ul>
<li> Technology assessment
<li> Strategic partnering
<li> Business incubation
<li> Launching and managing technology projects
<li> Networking and education opportunities
<li> Information services and marketing, including a major Internet Web Site at http://www.calstart.org that is updated twice daily.
</ul>

</p>

<p><h3 align><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3></p>


<p>Evidence of these solutions can best be seen through the participants that have led this year's technology drive:

<ul>
<p><li> CALSTART launched the nation's first electric station car program with the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. The first 12 purpose-built EVs are on the road and the final 28 will be delivered later this year.</p>

<p><li> Building on an earlier DARPA program, CALSTART has built two new EV chassis: one for advanced urban vehicles and one for low-cost to Asian countries.</p>

<p><li> CALSTART opened a business cluster at the Alameda Naval Air Station, the base's first civilian reuse project.  The site houses eight businesses in advanced transportation.</p>

<p><li> Capstone Turbine of Tarzana, Calif., developed a compact, lightweight advanced turbine for heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicles, providing equivalent range of conventionally fueled vehicles but with dramatic performance, energy efficiency, and emissions improvements.</p>

<p><li> Jefferson Programmed Power, now at the Alameda Naval Air Station, is developing a programmable DC controller and software to help improve the performance and extend the range of electric vehicles with DC drive trains.

<p><h3 align><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3></p>

<ul>

<p><li> Rocketdyne/Rockwell Corporation of Seal Beach, Calif., will conduct safety and containment testing of a low-cost titanium flywheel using a unique rotor design which allows the flywheel to fail in a very safe mode. </p> 
<p><li> U.S. Flywheel Systems in Newbury Park, Calif., will test four different high-energy density composite rotor flywheel energy storage systems to determine durability and failure modes.  The systems have a projected capability of enduring 10,000 charge/discharge cycles.</p>
<p><li> AVCON will manufacture and test magnetic bearings for four flywheel projects at its Agoura Hills, Calif. facilities to improve the performance of high-speed magnetic bearing systems.</p>
<p><li> Coriolis Corporation of Saratoga, Calif., will demonstrate a low-cost high-voltage circuit breaker that could be used as a battery safety switch, with strong applications to high-powered vehicles such as trucks and tanks.</p>
<p><li> Moller International of Davis, Calif., will develop a very low-emission rotary-powered auxiliary power unit engine for hybrid electric vehicles.  The unit will be tested to determine if target goals of more than 70 miles per gallon and equivalent zero-emissions vehicle emissions are met. </p>
<p><li> Aerovironment Inc. in Monrovia, Calif., and Rod Millen Motorsport will evaluate and test a wide range of high risk components for the second generation Advanced Hybrid Electric Reconnaissance Vehicle (AHERV).  The companies will test traction motors and batteries, among others, in the existing Joint Tactical Electric Vehicle.</p>
<p><li> Alturdyne of San Diego, Calif. will build a 40 kW rotary power unit as a power generator which will be tested aboard a next generation hybrid electric bus.</p>
</ul>	
	<p>CALSTART will continue to help develop critical technologies while also working to encourage large-scale deployment of clean fuel vehicles in market segments where they work best.</p>
	<p>We will also continue to provide the base of information services and education that encourage industry growth, particularly through expansion of our Internet Web Site for Advanced Transportation.</p>
