P-166s top hardware hits

By:
MARK HARRINGTON & GREGORY QUICK

LAS VEGAS-Intel will aim its most powerful Pentium processors
at the consumer market this week with the introduction of the
P-150 and 166MHz chips. And Intel vendors from Compaq, IBM,
AST, Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment are expected to
show units-publicly or privately-sporting the new processors
at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show here.

The Pentium 150 and 166MHz chips will find their way into the
latest consumer systems at lower price points than any other
new Pentium processor because of more efficient manufacturing
processes, said Frank Spindler, marketing manager for Pentium
at Intel. The company had begun building inventory and shipping
production quantities to OEMs in December, allowing retailers
to have quantities of the units to ship at time of introduction.

New desktop systems are just the start of a broad roster of
CES introductions planned this week.

Compaq, whose chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer is keynoting
the show, is expected this week to introduce its first products
from a joint venture with toymaker Fisher-Price earlier this
year. Compaq is also expected to make several other breakthrough
computer-product announcements, some publicly, others privately.
Among the more noteworthy, it will show off a new system that
incorporates a scanner into its keyboard. Desktop model 7232
uses PaperPort software and can scan items from business cards
to standard-sized paper. The system carries a $2,199 MAP, but
Compaq is also expected to sell the unit as a separate accessory.

Compaq will also introduce a minitower with Panasonic's PD read
write optical drive built in. Model 9240 is a Pentium 133MHz
with the PD drive and a $2,499 MAP. Compaq is also showing
units with a six-speed CD-ROM drive, one of many companies
upgrading to that technology beginning this year. The company
is also expected to make hardware MPEG a "modular" option on
most systems. Only two high-end systems have hardware MPEG
standard, though most now feature software MPEG. Compaq is
also expected to tell retailers of an effort to reduce returns
to 5 percent this year from 8 percent, and to launch a 900
number for software service, charging $2 a minute.

IBM is expected to show new Pentium 150MHz and 166MHz units
here at CES, while also moving to six-speed CD-ROM drives,
and will become one of the first systems makers to show a four
speed, four-disc CD-ROM changer. Pricing and availability on
the units weren't available at press time, but IBM reportedly
has told retailers to expect few new SKUs during the first
quarter.

Canon Computer Systems has been telling retailers to expect
a rejuvenated PC effort, with a new line that includes six
speed CD-ROMs, a four-disc changer and a removable hard drive
that allows users to store 850M bytes of data on a removable
card.

Another company sporting higher-level Intel processors will
be NEC Technologies, which has the Ready 9552, a 150MHz multimedia
machine. Among its features are full-screen, full-motion video
playback, 3-D stereo surround sound, a hand-held remote and
an answering machine with speakerphone and voice mail. It includes
16M bytes of RAM, a 1.6G-byte hard drive, a 28.8K-bps DSVD
fax modem and 2M-bytes VRAM. The system, which has an expected
street price of $3,099, features 20 software titles.

Hewlett-Packard will use the show to relaunch its OmniGo 100
palmtop organizer; the company has fixed a battery problem
that caused memory problems. HP is also expected to show the
OmniGo 700, an integrated cellular communications and organizer.
It will not be officially launched in the United States due
to regulatory problems regarding the frequency used by the
device; however, the company is hopeful that it will clear
that hurdle and be able to ship it sometime this year.

Toshiba will be showing behind closed doors a sub-$2,000 personal
computer optimized for the SoHo market that will be powered
by the 75MHz Pentium processor. It is expected to ship in February.

Rise of 0% deals distorts margin -- Retail Reliance On No-Interest
Financing Terms Spurs Scrutiny

By:
MICHAEL WALD

EDEN PRAIRIE, MINN.-As no-payment, no-interest deals spiraled
to new heights during last year's fourth quarter, Wall Street
analysts, consumer advocates and even some retailers began
voicing heightened concern about the longer-term expense of
such generosity.

Amid cut-throat pricing and shriveling product life cycles,
liberal financing terms, while driving sales, are cutting into
retail profit margins at a time when retailers are straining
to bulk up earnings. Perhaps more damaging is that some retailers'
terms, which require that all back interest be paid if a consumer
doesn't settle his or her bill in full at the end of the specified
no-interest period, are raising red flags among state regulators.
Last year, Oregon-based Smith's Home Furnishings was hit with
a $450,000 fine by the Washington State attorney general for
failing to adequately inform consumers about the terms of its
no-interest offer. Smith's has since gone out of business.

Later last year, while investigating a Montgomery Ward policy
that punishes sales associates for including zero-percent financing
in a sale, CRW learned that several state attorneys general
have formed a task force looking into the broader topic of
no-interest financing deals.

While attorneys on the task force declined to comment on the
nature of their investigation, they did indicate a high level
of interest in the Montgomery Ward policy.

Heightened concern about such financing offers comes as retailers
are raising the stakes to new heights. Best Buy last fall upped
the ante to 15 months.

Consumer electronics vendors, some of which sponsor the offers,
are said to be considering extending the terms to 18 to 24
months. And while little information is available about the
delinquency rate on the longer-term deals, there is a lingering
suspicion that it may increase with the generosity of the terms,
particularly for computer sales.

"It's particularly risky in computers because of the depreciation,
obsolescence problem," said Chuck Cebuhar, divisional vice
president and general manager for home electronics and home
office products at Sears. "What are consumers going to do when
the bill comes due a year from now if the product is, in their
minds, worth half the value?"

But like many retailers, Sears is compelled to offer long-term,
no-interest, deferred-payment financing to keep up with competitors,
Cebuhar said.

"We have to offer our customers competitive [no-interest, deferred
payment] financing, but we are not nearly as aggressive as
other retailers," he said. "We're in a reactive, defensive
mode, rather than in a proactive mode."

Offering no-interest, deferred-payment financing reduces already
thin margins among all retailers that offer such terms.

But while players such as Sears and Circuit City offer financing
options through their own banks, others such as Best Buy must
go outside their companies to provide such deals, shaving profits
even further.

David Childe, a specialty retail analyst at Wall Street brokerage
firm Salomon Brothers in New York, said Best Buy may have attracted
customers by selling computers on 15-month no-interest, deferred
payment terms, but at a cost.

"They're not making money doing it, because they're eating up
almost the entire gross margin in the category," Childe said.
"By my estimate, it probably costs Best Buy 8 to 9 points"
of margin to offer such financing.

Mark Mandel, an analyst at Chicago Corp., a New York brokerage,
agreed.

"Best Buy's promotional financing moves have generated huge
increases in sales, but at the expense of gross margins," Mandel
said. "They're paying through the bigger [fees] they pay to
third-party [financing] providers, which hurts their gross
margin, and aggressive pricing, which also hurts gross margins
in the obvious way. I think it's self-defeating-they're generating
15 percent comp-store increases, but their stock is hitting
new 52-week lows since people are cutting their [earnings]
estimates because their margins are deteriorating. I think
they've gone too far."

Best Buy executives were unavailable to discuss the retailer's
financing plans.

Some retailers, such as Chicago-based Montgomery Ward, are attempting
to recoup some costs of offering no-interest, deferred-payments
financing by cutting sales commissions.

Late in October, Montgomery Ward cut commissions up to 9 percent
on purchases that involve deferred-payment, no-interest financing
running from 90 days to 12 months unless a sales associate
simultaneously sells a three- or five-year extended warranty
(CRW, Dec. 4/11, 1995)

Montgomery Ward and other retailers routinely make fat margins
on sales of extended warranties.

The company said it enacted the policy because of widespread
abuses by sales associates, whom it accused of using no-interest,
deferred-payment plans to induce customers to buy merchandise
that was ineligible for such financing.

Montgomery Ward sales associates said the company's cash registers
are programmed to prevent such abuses. A company spokeswoman
agreed, but said many sales associates have discovered ways
to foil the registers and complete such sales.

The company's attempt to recoup some of the costs of offering
no-interest, deferred-payment financing apparently is not without
its own risks, however.

When CRW contacted consumer advocates at the Illinois and California
attorneys general offices, officials in both agencies vowed
to scrutinize Montgomery Ward's advertising of no-interest,
deferred-payment financing.

Sources said a multistate task force is currently examining
tactics that retailers use to advertise no-interest, deferred
payment financing.

In July 1995, Smith's Home Furnishings, which went out of business
last year, agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a lawsuit brought
by the Washington State attorney general's office in 1993 on
a variety of deceptive advertising and sales practices.

Among the charges in the lawsuit were allegations that claimed
the retailer was offering "zero down payment, zero interest
for one full year" without disclosing that if the full purchase
price was not paid within that year, the buyer would be charged
interest, compounded monthly, from the date of purchase.

Registering Disappointment -- Microsoft's Bob celebrates lonely
first birthday

By:
YARDENA ARAR

LAS VEGAS-So, what about Bob?

A year after a Microsoft team led by Melinda Gates unveiled
its ultra-user-friendly social interface in an all-out media
blitz surpassed only by Windows 95, Bob's cheery happy-face
package has largely disappeared from shelves in smaller stores;
in larger outlets, he's a little yellow Frisbee in a sea of
Windows 95 products. His name appears in a few OEM bundles,
but for the most part, Bob's a pretty lonely guy.

While Microsoft would not comment on industry estimates of sales
(excluding OEM units) of less than 300,000, the company in
September quietly lowered its price from $99.95 to $54.95 and
announced a free Bob "plus pack," obtainable by dialing a toll
free number.

Product manager Jennifer Stewart termed Bob "a 1.0 product that
we're doing a lot of learning with...We'll be taking all the
feedback we're getting and improving the product."

Asked if Microsoft was disappointed with sales, she replied
 "I think you always have high expectations for your new product.
Certainly at launch, we were at levels that were similar to
established home products, like Encarta or Works. Post-launch
sales have dipped a bit, but they're steady, and the thing
that's very encouraging and exciting is the customer reaction
to the product."

However, outside Microsoft, Bob is generally viewed as a rare
Redmond ne'er-do-well.

"Because it is Microsoft and it didn't sell tens of millions
of copies, it's viewed as a failure," said Karl Wong, a software
analyst at Dataquest, San Jose, Calif.

But Microsoft itself generated those high expectations by hyping
the product beyond what it could deliver, he said.

"Whether it's a good product or a bad product per se, Microsoft
oversold the expectations of what the product actually was
and could be," said Wong.

From a broader perspective, he said, "This whole idea of a social
interface that was going to bring tens of thousands of people
into computing was false. Some people are technophobes, and
no matter what kind of paradigm you use, it's still a computer."

Wong and others also said that Bob's appearance-and especially
its use of animated characters as personal "guides"-was all
wrong for the target audience.

"The whole cartoon-like atmosphere of the product seemed aimed
at the younger set, but younger kids are ready to adapt to
technology and don't need the cutesy interface. Whereas, for
the older ones, it's already embarrassing enough that they
feel intimidated by technology, let alone to have some animated
character talk to them on screen," Wong said. "If that paradigm
were true, we'd have little animation characters doing taxes
and programming the VCR."

Lisa Farrell, senior buyer at the Eden Prairie, Minn.-based
Best Buy chain, said Best Buy never stocked Bob in quantity.

"We didn't grasp what the draw was going to be for the consumer,"
she said. "It was not what it was hyped up to be."

While Microsoft said that those who do use Bob love it (the
company reports that 83 percent of registered users surveyed
found their PCs more useful with Bob) Farrell said she sees
no indication that the word is getting out to the marketplace.

"People purchase a lot of software based on word of mouth,"
she said. "The sales [of Bob] have been steady...They really
need to reposition the product."

Consultant Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies, San Jose, Calif.,
who, when Bob was first announced, predicted that it would
find a warm reception from computer neophytes, said he still
believes Microsoft's market research was correct in determining
that computers needed to be demystified in order to attract
new users.

"But while novices have been coming in, surprisingly they've
been showing a lot of acumen in learning the PC, and they've
looked at Bob and decided they didn't need it," Bajarin said.

He theorized that some new users already had their own personal
guides-a computer-literate friend or family member. Others
were really first-time buyers, already familiar with PCs from
work or school, as opposed to computer novices.

Bajarin noted that the learning curve Bob was supposed to help
surmount is addressed in easy-to-read documentation supplied
with many popular applications, particularly those intended
for home use.

Some of these applications duplicate Bob's features, and Microsoft's
Stewart believes that the Microsoft marketing machine's principal
failure was in educating consumers about the household tasks
the program could handle.

"One of the mistakes that we made is that you can't lead only
with selling an approach to computing," she said. "People didn't
know how useful Bob is for home management-writing letters,
tracking schedules...We need to address the issue of what people
are using it for as well as how easy it is to use."

Bajarin agreed that consumers didn't see past Bob's interface.
But he questioned whether even new users would be satisfied
with Bob as, say, a word processor or a household finance manager,
when they've seen what can be done with more sophisticated
products such as Word or Quicken.

"The bottom line is, people wanted these robust applications,"
Bajarin said.

Walter Miao, a software specialist at IDC/Link Resources, New
York, voiced similar criticisms.

"It's certainly a cute program and interesting to a neophyte.
It's a convenient home-oriented all-in-one package. But once
the novelty wears off, it's a very boring package," Miao said.
"I can't do enough with it."

Some of these criticisms may be addressed in the next release
of Bob. Stewart said the product was on an 18- to 24-month
upgrade cycle, which means that Bob 2.0 would not roll out
much before Q4 of 1996.

She declined to comment on changes under consideration, but
they're said to include everything from the addition of telephony
features and less cartoon-like personal guides to the integration
of modules from other Microsoft productivity packages.

Bajarin believes Bob may be a product that came before its time.
He pointed out that the vast majority of first-time PC buyers
right now are in households with income of $42,000 or more
a group that would tend to either be PC-literate to begin with
or have friends and family members who are.

Top 100 surpass $23B

By:
ROGER C. LANCTOT

NEW YORK-For the second year in a row, the retail computer industry
hit the jackpot in 1995, posting a 38.3 percent gain in sales,
according to Computer Retail Week's annual survey of the top
100 computer retailers.

The retail portion of sales was up a robust 45 percent, to $19.3
billion, with total sales, including non-retail sales, surpassing
$23.1 billion.

The sales data in the CRW report is based on estimates derived
from public and private data sources. The data reflects estimates
of sales for calendar year 1995.

Five stores finished with more than $1 billion in sales of computer
related merchandise, two more than last year. CompUSA, Best
Buy and Computer City SuperCenters were joined in the billion
dollar club by Office Depot and Circuit City Stores.

Hardware drove market gains with a hefty 45 percent increase
compared to 1994, according to the CRW report. Software sales
swelled by 26 percent, propelled by gains in the office superstore,
electronics superstore, mass merchant and warehouse club channels.

Software specialists' sales were flat compared to '94 as this
mall-skewed channel continued to take a pounding from superstore
retailers and a dramatic broadening of the software marketplace
to include book, toy and media retailers as well as supermarkets.

As a group, software specialists Electronics Boutique, NeoStar,
Egghead and Software City saw their collective share of retail
computer merchandise sales drop from 8.9 percent in '94 to
6.5 percent in '95.

The number of stores selling computer-related products jumped
by 13.3 percent in '95, based solely on a review of the top
100 computer retailers. New members of CRW's Top 100 list include
Toys R Us with 650 stores selling software, and media retailer
Virgin Megastore with five locations.

Circuit City jumped into fifth place with a 101.4 percent increase
in computer-related sales in '95 compared with '94. The company
jumped ahead of Micro Center, which moved ahead of Egghead
Software.

All three major office superstores made the top-10 list this
year and were among with biggest gainers. Staples had a 225
percent gain to finish in eighth place; OfficeMax was up 49
percent in ninth place; and Office Depot notched a 66 percent
gain to finish fourth for the second year in a row behind Computer
City. Best Buy rang up $2.5 billion in computer sales, a 47
percent increase.

Computer City opened 26 stores in the United States in '95 to
help stimulate its 62 percent sales gain, putting the chain
in third place in overall sales behind CompUSA and Best Buy.
CompUSA remained the dominant hardware retailer, with more
than $2 billion in hardware sales in '95. And Egghead held
onto its crown as the leading software retailer, despite flat
sales.

Computer superstores accounted for 36.1 percent of all retail
computer sales in '95, the largest share overall. Electronics
superstores captured 18.8 percent of all computer-related retail
sales, and office superstores increased their share of retail
computer merchandise sales from 10.1 percent in '94 to 13.2
percent in '95.

TV tube vendors picture hybrid PCs -- Most Focusing On 27-,
35-Inch Monitors Made For PC/TV Units



NEW YORK-Amid growing talk of personal computers and other consumer
electronics converging, television tube manufacturers are venturing
into the uncharted territory of PC/TVs.

The exact size of the market for a product that conceivably
would combine the processing power of a PC with the ability
of a TV tube to deliver bright, clear pictures remains ill
defined. But despite this lack of parameters, interest among
tube manufacturers is surging, with some projecting a 300,000
 to 400,000-unit market in 1996, with most PC/TVs carrying
a $1,000 suggested retail price.

Most of this interest has centered on big-screen tubes in the
27- to 35-inch range, which currently have a standard-grade
0.55 dot pitch. The market activity will eventually move into
the high-resolution 0.28 dot pitch range, the hallmark of PC
monitors.

"All we know is we've had a lot of inquiries and a lot of interest
in doing a large-format display, with the applications being
presentations and interactive TV," said an executive with a
Japanese electronics giant. "We're all wondering where this
is going, and I think a lot of these guys who are jumping on
the bandwagon are doing so because they've heard somebody else
is."

Indeed, when Apple introduced a full-function Macintosh PC with
a 14-inch monitor and a TV tuner in 1993, it was alone with
a product that survived only a short time on retail shelves.
Toshiba followed with the 20-inch Toshiba Integrated Multimedia
Monitor (TIMM) in 1994 and has had limited success selling
the concept to such retail powers as Circuit City.

But now Hitachi has said it will introduce a 27-inch model this
year, while Thomson Consumer Electronics will use the Winter
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week to gauge interest
in finer-pitch 19-, 27- and 35-inch multimedia monitors. Even
Proton, which builds conventional PC monitors on an OEM basis,
said it will introduce 15- and 17-inch PC/TVs in 1996, even
though it concedes a large market won't emerge until 1997.

Where these initial product offerings will lead and who will
buy them is open for debate. Many industry officials argue
that corporate presentations are likely to be the first target,
and they point to Toshiba's TIMM, which has sold less than
100,000 units during its first year on the market at $799 retail.

"It's really for industrial presentations at this point, and
we may not bring the product to market until 1997," said William
Tovatt, sales and marketing vice president at Proton. "I think
the learning curve in the education for consumers has to start."

Stephen Nickerson, vice president of marketing for TVs and VCRs
at Toshiba, said the company plans to move to larger sizes
and is studying a 27-inch tube currently available in Japan.
While TIMM's 0.55 dot pitch has slowed sales, perceptions change
"once people understand what the product is and what the differences
are," Nickerson said. "We believe there is definitely a market
for this and it's just a matter of when we introduce other
products."

Whether there will be a consumer market for PC/TVs will be determined
at the retail level, where dealers have yet to fully embrace
the concept. If the product uses a standard-grade TV monitor,
some dealers said, it may get caught up in the dot pitch "numbers
game" that governs conventional PC monitors.

The goal of most potential entrants in the PC/TV race is a 0.28
dot pitch monitor, but that would require a design to compensate
for the brightness that is lost in moving to a finer dot pitch.
While 0.55 monitors serve well for presentations and NTSC video,
a fine pitch is needed for a "hard-core work machine" used
for spreadsheets and other forms of number crunching, manufacturers
said.

One option could be to use a technology like Toshiba's high
contrast "Microfilter" tube, which raises brightness while
electronically increasing contrast by placing a color filter
in front of each phosphor dot.

"TV/PCs don't spec out with some of the better monitors right
now," L.A.Tronics video buyer Robert Becker said. "So a lot
of people dismiss them as not a serious piece of computer equipment.
But as the market matures, there will be a need for cross-compatibility,
so these companies are doing the right thing in getting involved."

Yet despite the focus on fine-pitch tubes, a medium-resolution
product may be the best option for a device designed for mixed
applications, said Edward Egert, vice president of sales and
marketing for Philips Display Products.

Egert concedes the company is looking for the "right combination
of performance characteristics," but hasn't decided on the
final specifications.

"Multimedia says the consumers will use these products for the
alphanumerics as well as with picture graphics," said Egert.
"Commercial products have been a way of shaking out a technology
and getting a better margin while you're doing it, but I'm
seeing this coming from both sides, because there is a lot
of interest from the consumer producers as well."

One thing that does remain certain, however, is that the market
will be dominated by conventional tubes. Thomson showed a 26
inch wide-screen monitor at Comdex in April, but couldn't sell
customers on the concept. Thomson has since switched development
efforts to conventional 4 x 3 aspect ratio tubes.

Packard Bell firms up its software company

By:
KRISTEN KENEDY

WESTLAKE VILLAGE, CALIF.-Capitalizing on its retail brand presence,
Packard Bell is expected to announce at the Winter Consumer
Electronics Show that it has renamed its computer software
subsidiary Packard Bell Interactive, hired two additional sales
executives and launched a remerchandising program.

The year-old company, which has been using the name Active Imagination,
launched a line of budget-priced children's storybook CD-ROM
titles early last year. But despite Packard Bell's mighty PC
presence in the industry, retailers were only stocking limited
selections of the products. "We didn't have the large distribution
that the top titles have," said Glen Uslan, vice president
of marketing for the software company.

Thus, Packard Bell elected to change the company name to a brand
that is immediately recognizable to consumers. The company
also hired John Rutter, formerly a channel marketing manager
with Microsoft, as senior vice president of sales and marketing.
Working under Rutter will be Steve Boehm, vice president of
worldwide sales, who was previously North American sales manager
at Medio Multimedia.

In addition, the software firm has priced all its products at
$24.99 to $29.99 with the intent of increasing perceived value.
Uslan said the titles, previously priced at $19.99, were intended
to be merchandised as a budget shipper display. However, Uslan
said retailers generally purchased a few SKUs from the line
and displayed the titles with other CD-ROMs in the edutainment
section, where customers would expect to see higher-priced
products.

"An impulse purchase only works if merchandised as an impulse
buy, and retailers were not prepared to do that," Uslan explained.

CA may tailor software bundles -- Publisher's Consumer Division
Looks To Gain Market Share For Its Titles

By:
Kathleen Richards

ISLANDIA, N.Y.-This week at the Consumer Electronics Show, Computer
Associates' consumer division, 4Home Productions, will discuss
with retailers and potential OEM partners customized CD-ROM
disc compilations.

The move is an effort by the company to gain market share from
division titles, which to date have shown lackluster retail
sales. Last fall, the company decided not to offer SimplyTax
through the retail channel due to unacceptably low stocking
levels.

"SimplyKids and SimplyHouse are not going to make a fortune
at retail," said Steve Gersten, 4Home Productions' director
of sales. "The alternate channel program provides good products
at a very good price-around $5 or $6, with little risk to the
retailer.

"4Home Productions has more than 30 [OEM] agreements in the
process," said Gersten.

All shipping consumer division titles are available for the
compilation program, excluding SimplyAccounting.

Huge Headaches Or Huge Profits? -- Megastores: Looking at the
bigger picture



NEW YORK-As consumer electronics and home-office retail chains
rush to open ever-larger stores, it remains to be seen whether
there will be profits at the end of the expansion.

The growth of the so-called megastores has occurred across the
country at an unending pace. Mammoth Incredible Universe stores
sprout in suburbia, Best Buy brings a 58,000-square-foot Concept
III format to Los Angeles and even Roberd's tries its hand
with a 250,000-square-foot outlet in Ohio. Circuit City, once
known for its cautious approach to expansion, is including
larger, 42,000-square-foot outlets as only a small portion
of the 60 to 65 stores it will open in 1996. Office Depot is
opening its first megastores, while The Good Guys! is scouting
turf for new 60,000-square-foot WOW! stores.

But while the number of megastores is growing rapidly, profits
are not. Incredible Universe began the year looking for a profit,
but will end it with an $11 million loss, analysts said.

Best Buy had planned to open 30 to 40 stores in 1996, but it
has come under intense pressure from investors to scale back
and restore profitability.

The issue has become whether the larger stores can generate
enough sales to overcome the increases in overhead that megastores
incur. Analysts point out that megastores should save retailers
money in the long run, since bigger outlets eliminate the need
for adding several smaller ones in a given market. But that
theory remains open for debate.

"There is a basic idea at retail that bigger is better, and
to a point, that is correct," said Ursula Moran, a research
analyst at Sanford P. Bernstein & Co., New York. "But the problem
is, sometimes retailers don't know when enough is enough. Having
done well with 32,000 square feet, better with 45,000, Best
Buy goes to 58,000, and 58,000 is too big."

Indeed, while megastores supply lower prices and larger product
selection, they haven't quite defined themselves for consumers.
While Incredible Universe tries to provide an entertaining
shopping environment, its merchandising of housewares and exercise
equipment with PCs and consumer electronics hasn't produced
profits.

Others have tried to offset a price-driven image with ventures
into high-end audio and have met mixed results.

Even office superstores that were once easy to define are branching
out to open 50,000-square-foot stores that offer copy centers
and office furniture along with PCs and printers.

The need to provide a defining characteristic has become even
more critical in an era where consumers may look at ads from
five stores but, on average, shop at fewer than two, analysts
said. Shopping demographics like these have led some analysts
to project that half of all retail stores will be gone by the
year 2000, and that only those with a niche will survive.

Consumer electronics and office superstores are still relative
newcomers to the megastore game, and without a niche they may
have limited life spans, said analysts.

"In every big box there is a point where you go beyond being
impressive to a point where you're too confusing," said Britt
Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, Charleston, S.C.
"And that's why I think some of Best Buy's newer stores aren't
meeting their expectations. And if you look at some of these
Incredible Universe stores, they've gone over the edge."

But despite such shortcomings, the megastores have their supporters,
who argue that the format is in its infancy when it comes to
consumer electronics and that many markets remain open for
expansion.

"The buyers at Home Depot and Ikea, which are well accepted,
all buy consumer electronics. It's the same customer just making
a different purchase," Channel Marketing president David Goldstein
said.

But where consumers buy products is becoming increasingly critical
in determining the livelihoods of regional retailers. The growth
of megastores may also mean the end for some regional chains.

And while megastore supporters claim that the bigger outlets
increase overall sales in a given market, the question becomes
whether the sales are new revenues or taken from a competitor.

The past year has seen an unusually large number of retailers
close their doors at the same time others are opening theirs.
Smith's Home Furnishings liquidated this fall, a little over
a year after The Good Guys! and Incredible Universe arrived
in the Pacific Northwest. And Swallen's closed its stores in
Cincinnati after 46 years, citing, among other things, increased
competition from consumer electronics retailers like Sun TV,
which entered the market with its larger, 50,000-square-foot
Super Savings Centers.

"It's a zero-sum game at this point, because the projected growth
rate of the big retailers is well in excess of the market growth
rate. They grow by taking share from somebody else," Moran
said.

Sega now on the MAP

By:
KRISTEN KENEDY

REDWOOD CITY, CALIF.-Sega of America this year plans to speed
release of new game titles to market, work to solidify retail
relationships and firm up its new ventures into the distribution
and software businesses, president and chief executive Tom
Kalinske said in an interview with CRW last month.

Among more notable changes at Sega as the year drew to a close,
the company implemented a minimum advertised pricing (MAP)
strategy on its products. Retailers "seemed to be OK with it.
Almost everyone thinks it is a cool idea," Kalinske said.

But the game maker is still struggling with retailer backlash
over its surprise decision last year to launch its Saturn system
exclusively to three retailers.

While some retailers are still privately expressing dismay over
Sega's announcement last May that it would ship Saturn systems
early to NeoStar stores, Electronics Boutique and Toys 'R'
Us, Kalinske said Sega's position to retailers will be very
clear during the coming year.

"We launched Saturn early because of significant consumer demand
and to get a jump on the competition," he said. "The impact
that had on our retail relationships was a difficult lesson
to learn. I believe we have a very good read on the situation
and are working to make relationships with our retailers much
stronger than before, with specific POP, demonstrator and information
campaigns that are helping our retailers in the entire category."

In addition to stitching together some torn retailer relationships,
Sega is pushing forward with Sega Soft, a joint venture announced
in November by Japanese software developer CSK Group.

Although Kalinske would not discuss specific projects already
under way at the company, he said titles from the venture will
begin to ship sometime in summer or fall. One such project,
he said, marries film graphics and computer animation with
multiplayer capabilities; another is a multiplayer sports game
that lets users make changes in the game that aren't currently
possible.

While Sega Soft will focus primarily on PC and Saturn games,
developers will also be designing games for the Internet in
the future, said Kalinske.

Combined with the titles that are also in development at Sega
of America, Kalinske said there are about 30 software titles
in development for this year, with an additional 25 titles
in production in Japan that could also be marketed in the United
States. Add to that other titles in development from third
party developers and the market will see about 180 titles this
year for the Saturn system, Kalinske said.

"It always comes down to who has the best software," he said.
"What we do [in the United States] is create software. We happen
to have hardware platforms too, but largely we make software.
We think that gives us a leg up over the competition, but we
will see."

The company will focus on its core hardware products: the Pico
for 3- to 7-year-olds, the Genesis for 8- to 13-year-olds,
and the Saturn, intended for those 14 and older.

Despite the increased number of titles coming to market from
Sega this year, the company's distribution facility will still
not reach maximum capacity. Thus, Sega teamed with the giant
Softbank conglomerate, in a deal announced late last year,
to provide distribution services for publishers and peripherals
manufacturers. At press time, Sega still had not chosen a name
for the company, which has been operating under the code name
Game Express. Sega expects to announce a name for the company
and its first vendors at the end of this month.

The new company differs from a traditional distributor in that
it does not seek to help vendors sell products to retail. What
it will provide instead is efficient distribution and fulfillment.

The distribution company's strong suit, according to Kalinske,
is a highly effective computer system that can deliver product
direct to stores in as little as 24 hours, but usually between
38 and 48 hours.

The system can link directly with retailers using EDI. But for
those retailers that don't rely on such capabilities, the new
company will have reps in the field that can place EDI from
the retail site using a notebook computer, a feature Sega of
America currently offers its retail customers.

SPA head testifies in FTC probe

By:
KRISTEN KENEDY

SAN MATEO, CALIF.-The Software Publishers Association, through
testimony to the Federal Trade Commission on Dec. 20, made
public its position on a variety of competitive issues that
face the computer industry, including controversial exclusive
distribution models that have sparked debate recently.

Ken Wasch, president of the SPA, told Computer Retail Week that
the FTC has been conducting broad public hearings to examine
how antitrust principles, written and enforced in the industrial
age, will apply to companies as the United States moves into
the information age. The hearings are unrelated to an informal
inquiry launched by the FTC late last year into some software
publishers' refusal to supply titles to publisher/distributor
NewMedia Express.

About 30 companies have testified at the broader industry hearings,
Wasch said, including the Computer and Communications Industry
Association, IBM and Borland. Microsoft, NewMedia Express and
GoodTimes Interactive have not testified in the hearings, said
an FTC spokeswoman.

The spokeswoman said the three-month-long hearings, which have
been extended until Jan. 23, will be used to determine if changes
are necessary in "policy or other areas" in high-tech competition.

The SPA hopes the hearings will result in new guidelines on
how the FTC deals with what the SPA terms "abusive practices
by dominant firms."

Wasch's testimony to the FTC was centered on discriminatory
access to information from the developer of a market-dominating
operating system or platform, exclusionary restraints in technology
licensing agreements and control over retail distribution channels.

Regarding exclusive distribution agreements, Wasch said in his
testimony: "Many of our members depend on the major mass-merchandising
retail chains for the distribution and sale of their software
products to the ultimate consumer.

"Effective market access rests on meaningful shelf space and
other merchandising treatment of their products at the retail
level. Yet, increasingly, these retail chains have been persuaded
to transfer to dominant competitors the control over shelf
space and other critical merchandising functions for entire
product categories within their stores. As a result, our smaller
members must work through and depend entirely upon their major
competitors for their placements in these stores. It is unrealistic
to expect fair treatment or anything approaching a level playing
field in this situation.

"In short, dominant firms have incentives to misuse their power
over retail channels as a means of maintaining and enhancing
their dominance by impairing the ability of smaller rivals
to develop satisfactory distribution arrangements. Again, we
would invite consideration of whether and how government antitrust
enforcement policy could appropriately address this problem."

As part of his testimony, Wasch also said the SPA conducted
a survey of its 1,200 members regarding anti-competitive issues.
Wasch reported that respondents of the survey are "greatly
concerned that increased distribution control by software companies
raises barriers to entry for new software companies."

According to the testimony, eight in 10 respondents said, "The
increased control of distribution channels by software publishers
has raised barriers to entry for new software companies or
threatened the existence of existing software companies."

Retail Digest


The Home Computing Supershow kicked off its third event in San
Francisco last week with approximately 34,000 attendees. Like
its rival ComputerMania, launched by Softbank earlier last
year, the expo houses software, hardware and online vendors,
as well as a number of computer stations where children and
adults can test new software or try their hand at the Internet.
Circuit City and the regional CompuTown were selling hardware
and software at booths as well. Managers from both stores said
that while sales were good by the second day of the show, consumer
awareness and name recognition were the priority. By far, the
most popular demonstrations at the show were the children's
demo stations, where parents and kids could test-drive the
latest edutainment titles.

Service Merchandise's former assistant vice president and computer
buyer, Mike Malone, is launching his own computer and telephone
store, called W2F2, in Nashville. At press time, he was planning
a soft opening on the Friday before Christmas. The 3,256-square
foot unit will position itself as a "convergence" store, doing
build-to-order PCs but also carrying Packard Bell. "I'm trying
to put the personal back into the PC," Malone said last month.

RadioShack president Leonard Roberts (pictured below) took on
the additional role of president of Tandy last month, according
to the companies. Roberts is credited with turning the RadioShack
chain into one of the gems of the Tandy fold. Roberts reports
to Tandy chairman and chief executive John Roach, who last
held the title of president.

Montgomery Ward said George Antoon has been named divisional
merchandise manager for all home and office categories. He
was previously senior buyer for computers and machines. Also
at Ward, Laura Soosloff has been named buyer for business machines.
She reports to Antoon.

Apex Department Stores, Pawtucket, R.I., named Malcolm Ballinger
electronics group merchandise manager. He had been general
merchandise manager for Campo in New Orleans, and did stints
with Mrs. B's and helped found defunct World Radio.

Office Depot said Todd Daer, who had recently joined the company
as senior software buyer after working with distributor Tech
Data, has left the company and was replaced by an inside staffer.

CD-ROMs Dominate Offerings -- Kid's software programs among
CES highlights

By:
KAREN BANNAN & DAVID MYRON

EDITOR'S NOTE: When the show floor opens on Jan. 5, more than
175 companies will exhibit their wares at the Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas. Here's a sneak peek at several new products
that are expected to be seen.

Syncronys, amid FTC inquiry, recalls SoftRAM95

By:
Kathleen Richards

NEW YORK-After months of controversy, Syncronys, on Dec. 18,
recalled SoftRAM95, its best-selling memory enhancement product,
as the Federal Trade Commission investigates whether the product
worked as advertised by the company.

SoftRAM95 was shipped in August and quickly became the leading
Windows 95 utility at retail. The software, which carried a
$29.99 suggested retail price, was the first Windows 95 memory
utility to reach the market, and promised to "Double Your Memory,"
providing consumers with an inexpensive software solution to
the RAM-intensive Windows 95 operating system.

By November, Vancouver, British Columbia-based Syncronys had
sold 400,000 units of SoftRAM95 through retail, and the product
had remained the leading utility at retail since it was first
shipped in August, according to market researcher PC Data,
Reston, Va.

Although most customers apparently could not tell the difference
as evidenced by few returns-SoftRAM95 provided no memory improvements
to Windows 95 users, according to a National Software Testing
Laboratories test commissioned by competing publisher Connectix.

Syncronys notified channel partners in an Oct. 25 letter that
for the Windows 95 version of the product, which was shipped
in the same box as the Windows 3.1 version, "RAM compression
is not being delivered to the operating system on a consistent
basis." The letter stated that Syncronys would sticker boxes,
and would offer Windows 95 users a Windows 95 upgrade release
free of charge when it was shipped, or a full refund if desired.

Egghead and PriceCostco removed the leading utility immediately
from their stores. CompUSA has reduced the price on the product
to $9.95.

"The recall was to end the consumer confusion and to make a
clean break," said Syncronys president Rainer Poertner. "We
will resubmit upgrades of the Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 versions
of SoftRAM to Microsoft and Veritest, an independent testing
firm, within the next few days."

In fact, SoftRAM95 had not qualified for the "Designed for Windows
95" logo, although the logo appeared on the box, according
to Russ Stockdale, Windows 95 marketing manager at Microsoft.
"They did not qualify and were never authorized to display
it on their packaging," he said.

As the market-leading Windows 95 memory utility is recalled
from retail, competing publishers are left the task of convincing
consumers that the category is still viable.

Quarterdeck Office Systems, a supplier of DOS memory management
products, shipped MagnaRAM 2 in September, and the same technology
is incorporated in the company's higher-end QEMM 8 memory management
software. Both titles are native Windows 95 applications.

Connectix is entering the Windows 95 category after achieving
phenomenal success with its RAM Doubler software for the Macintosh
and limited success with a Windows 3.1 title. A native Windows
95 version of RAM Doubler is slated to ship early this year.

"I think that [SoftRAM95] has probably caused some confusion
among consumers in Q4 and will in Q1," said Roy MacDonald,
chief executive officer of Connectix. "The established companies
have to educate consumers that there are good solutions in
this category. In the long term, it won't have a lasting impact."

Many retailers increased direct business in '95

By:
MICHAEL WALD

NEW YORK-Many personal-computer retailers reported strong growth
in their direct-channel business during 1995, amid new and
expanded mail-order initiatives and corporate sales opportunities
sparked by Windows 95.

Others expanded their direct operations onto the Internet or
simply mailed more catalogs.

The arrival of Windows 95 last August boosted corporate sales
as businesses replaced or upgraded older machines to run the
new operating system, retailers said.

"We've seen a tremendous increase in our corporate sales as
companies replaced old systems with Pentium machines, and bought
more storage and memory for existing machines," said Larry
Adler, vice president of marketing at NCA Computer Products,
Sunnyvale, Calif.

CDW Computer Center president Greg Zeman said his company's
mail-order business grew more CPU-intensive as major systems
vendors gave the channel more attention in 1995. The company
won authorization to sell the full Apple Computer line through
mail order, and also participated in a Compaq pilot mail-order
program.

Some computer retailers that had previously avoided direct channels
jumped in last year. Computer City Super-Centers announced
its entry into the direct-marketing channel last June and sent
catalogs to more than 1 million customers last October. Prices
in those catalogs appeared to match those in its stores.

Other mail-order marketers, including Creative Computers, Micro
Warehouse, Programmer's Paradise, CDW and Insight Enterprises,
issued public offerings in 1995 to fuel expansion efforts focused
mainly on increasing catalog mailings.

Mail-order market leader Micro Warehouse moved aggressively
to increase the frequency of catalog mailings, the number of
people and businesses that received them and the breadth of
product offerings. Others, such as CDW and Insight Enterprises,
also stepped up catalog mailings and said they planned to further
expand such efforts in 1996.

Insight Direct, a division of Tempe, Ariz.-based Insight Enterprises,
mailed 7.4 million catalogs in fiscal year 1995, which ended
June 30. In fiscal 1996, the company projects it will mail
20 million to 30 million catalogs.

NCA increased catalog mailings from 10,000 units in 1994 to
400,000 last year, Adler said. Other smaller outfits, such
as Computer Town in Salem, N.H., and State Street Discount
in Portsmouth, N.H., also stepped up catalog mailings this
year, targeting customers beyond the local market for the first
time.

Even retailers that planned to expand catalog mailings more
slowly, such as Elek-Tek, which plans to go from three mailings
in 1995 to seven in 1996, are following Micro Warehouse's lead
in developing specialty catalogs for subsets of customers within
their databases.

Innovation wasn't limited solely to catalog mailings. Several
retailers and mail-order computer resellers unveiled Internet
sites in 1995. Some of these sites permitted point-and-click
credit-card purchases, while others were limited to displaying
products and a toll-free number for placing orders.

The Internet Shopping Network (ISN), Palo Alto, Calif., sold
more than

$1 million in personal-computer hardware and software in October
1995, vice president of marketing Bill Rollinson said.

Traffic Report: A Glance Back And A Look Ahead -- Best-dressed stories of '95
and '96

By:
KEVIN FERGUSON

OK, let's waste no time: Here are my top stories of 1995 and
1996.

 Best Slugfest: Undoubtedly no secret to anyone in the industry,
the controversy over used parts was a great shocker to the
rest of the world.

The finger-pointing between Compaq and Packard Bell, which is
far from over, quickly escalated to wild mud-slinging.

 Most Humorous Explanation:Packard Bell's retort to Compaq's
allegations that it was including used parts in its computers.
Packard Bell explained that it was just trying to be environmentally
conscious.

It's good to know our landfills will only overflow with disposable
diapers rather than hard drives, although hard drives break
down a lot faster.

 Most Successful Product Launch: Windows 95.

 Most Annoying Product Launch: Windows 95.

 Most Impressive Come-back: CompUSA, which improved margins
and sales, and still continued to expand.

 Toughest Strategy to Defend: The New-Media Express software
distribution model. Face it, the idea of working with your
chief competitor in hopes of beating your competitor is never
going to be all that popular.

 Most Familiar Story: Product shortages. While desktop sales
were still as strong in 1995 as they were in 1994, they could
have been that much stronger if supplies of the most popular
items had been available (typically those employing higher
end Pentiums). Look for a repeat in 1996.

 One Of The More Interesting Retail Stories In Progress: The
comeuppance due computer and electronics retailers whose zero
percent financing deals are no deals at all.

 Even Better Than That: The introduction of Internet boxes,
$500 PCs or whatever you want to call them.

Additionally, the growth of online, interactive gaming and computing
through cable companies and the Telcos.

 Mergers I'd Like To See In 1996: Micro Center and Elek-Tek;
Packard Bell and NEC; and me and the ski lift at Vail.

Editorial: PC retail market deserves your attention

By:
KEITH NEWMAN

For the third straight year, you have in front of you our Top
100/CES issue-the most exciting way we can think of to start
off the new year. And, once again, we have gone beyond our
existing standard by offering more data and analysis with the
goal of keeping you ahead of the sharp PC retail power curve.

It may seem odd to consider, but PCs are the most exciting high
growth category in the retail market today. Still, those who
try and drive it too hard are just as reckless as those who
fail to devote the necessary resources and commitment to it.
And, right now, the PC retail market deserves significant focus.

Consumer computing is booming, thanks to repeat home buyers
and work-at-home and small-business customers who overwhelmingly
shop at retail. Together, this represents a large and growing
percentage of the entire PC market. It may seem hard to fathom,
given the precarious profit picture most are faced with, but
the fact is, PCs remain the savior of technology retailers
and PC makers. According to research firm ARS, its survey of
50 retail computer superstore locations this past week revealed
that 58 percent of retailers believe that PC sales are better
than expected. Contrast this with everything else being written
about holiday retail sales or the overall outlook of retail
and it's easy to see the importance that computers hold for
these merchants.

But what remains difficult is trying to package this broad group
of retailers under one banner like the CRW Top 100. There are
high-service and self-service, destination and mall stores;
virtual stores and catalog showrooms; software-only chains;
media malls and cyberstores. And the list only continues to
broaden as retailers look to reach more customers and offer
more value. However, we feel this makes this comprehensive
and exhaustive project, which is spearheaded by our editorial
research director Roger Lanctot, more valuable than ever.

Just consider some of the findings: Overall store count among
the Top 100 has surpassed 20,000 locations, and total sales
are $23 billion, compared with $16 billion last year. Another
finding, to paraphrase an executive of one of our Top 10 companies
 "Leaders lead or get moved out of the way."

A case in point, CompUSA, the No. 1 retailer on our list, is
once again taking a leadership position, marketing to kids,
moms, power users, corporate buyers and selling more service
than ever before. Similarly, Tandy's three major retail chains
all deserve congratulations for driving store counts and sales
while pushing the envelope and testing new categories and new
marketing efforts.

Yet, the powerful regional computer superstores are giving no
quarter, while the office superstore and consumer electronics
chains are promoting the PC category like never before.

There are numerous other key market indicators throughout this
report and, as with everything we do, we hope it helps you
stay on the curve. Consider it a belated Christmas or Hanukkah
present.

3D Learning -- Kids get more CD morphing

By:
KAREN BANNAN

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, look out. Grandma Ollie is on
the way.

Harber Brothers Productions, an upstart children's software
company based in New York, this year will release two series
of children's CD-ROMs: KinderActive Musicals and KinderActive
Minds. The series feature 3-D rendering and morphing technology
targeted at children ages 3 through 8.

The first title from the KinderActive Minds series, Grandma's
Morphabet Soup, features a 3-D rendered kitchen in which children
can move and explore.

The title is designed to teach children early reading and learning
skills. Children are guided through the product by Grandma
Ollie. Sections include a 3-D spelling wheel that takes advantage
of both morphing and 3-D technology.

Grandma asks children to find a letter on the spinning wheel.
Once the correct letter is chosen, it morphs into an animal
or item that begins with the letter.

"We think kids are going to want to use the morphing over and
over. And as they play, they will be reinforcing the learning,"
said Jonathan Harber, the company president.

When he sat down to plan the software lines, he recruited several
veterans of the children's education and edutainment business
to sit on the company's board of advisors. They include a former
executive producer and head writer for "Sesame Street" and
"3-2-1 Contact," the producer of "Captain Kangaroo" and an
associate in education at the American Museum of Natural History
in New York.

In addition to the new technology, most of the titles employ
techniques similar to those that made the PBS children's television
programming so popular: music and character development. Jonathan
Harber feels both elements are missing from many of today's
software titles.

The company plans to release children's music tapes and CDs
in conjunction with the software launch. Harber says he hopes
to capture a healthy percentage of the children's music market,
which is now dominated by one company.

"The children's music market is 90 percent owned by Disney.
Kids really respond to music," said Harber.

He said that with the release of the KinderActive series the
company hopes to change the face of education, bringing it
into the home.

"Every industry has been updated from 100 years ago. If you
put doctors from 1896 in today's hospital, they would be lost
and unable to do their job. But if you brought teachers forward
in time, they would feel right at home. The change in children's
education is overdue, and it's starting in the home," said
Harber.

Business Deals Flourish -- Spinning a Web of infinite opportunities

By:
BRADLEY J. FIKES

Microsoft's belated but dramatic embrace of the WorldWide Web
early last month proved it: The Web's growth has become self
sustaining. As its ease of use and versatility increases, more
businesses find the Web impossible to ignore.

Just a few months ago, Microsoft appeared to be a near-monopoly,
able to set industry standards virtually at will. But during
the week of Dec. 4, it licensed Sun Microsystems' Java programming
technology for the Web and took other steps aimed at making
its software, including Windows 95, more Web-compatible.

Meanwhile, companies such as IBM, Netscape Communica-tions,
America Online and Intuit made their own Java-related deals
with Sun to create an easy-to-use Web programming language
rivaling Microsoft's own Visual Basic Script.

The story goes far beyond Microsoft's struggle to maintain its
dominant position in software, industry observers say. The
Web has created its own market, as well as opportunities that
the business community is now beginning to exploit seriously.

Trends include:

 A growing parallel retail market, especially for software and
other technology goods.

 Synergies between the Web and traditional advertising vehicles.

 Use of the Web as an "Intranet," allowing nearly platform-independent
communication between distant units of a business.

As for retail opportunities, retail outlets on the Web such
as eShop and Internet Shopping Network have so proliferated
they are no longer a novelty in the industry.

Salida, Colo.-based consultant Woody Liswood said the Web has
become an important supplementary market for retailing technology.
However, the average consumer will have little use for Web
shopping for now.

"I see it as being useful for people who already know what they
want," Liswood said. "When you reach that level of sophistication,
you can say 'OK, I wonder what's available' and do a Yahoo
search for modems."

As an example, Liswood pointed to one company, modems.com, that
sells its products exclusively through the Web.

"It used to be retail, they pulled it off the market and now
they're selling their modem-I think it's one of the best on
the market-strictly through the Web."

The canonical example of doing business via the Web is Netscape.
The company is known for essentially giving away its popular
Web browser to individual users so as to increase demand for
its server software. However, its Netscape General Store has
become increasingly more important to the company, said Hugh
Hempel, director of electronic marketing.

In February, Netscape put up a basic online order form, Hempel
said. In August, Netscape installed a full-fledged online store
where browsers could buy software, books, and even clothing
items such as boxer shorts embroidered with Netscape's mascot,
Mozilla.

"The Netscape store showcases our technology, but it's also
responsible for transacting at least 5-percent-plus, maybe
10 percent, of our business from a software point of view,"
Hempel said. "It's a non-trivial part of our story."

Hempel pointed to Internet Shopping Network, which advertises
"quite liberally" on Netscape's Web site, as another success
story.

"I know for a fact they're doing good business in both hardware
and software retailing on the 'net," Hempel said. "There are
certainly some people who otherwise would have gotten in their
car and driven down to CompUSA or wherever, but didn't do it.
I think it's a phenomenon that is not a flash in the pan by
any stretch of the imagination."

Liswood and Hempel agreed that the problem of data security,
while it exists, has been exaggerated.

"I think it's something the Eastern press likes to yell about
because it makes good headlines, but they're not computer users,
and I don't think they understand the problem," Liswood said.

According to Hempel, "The people who ultimately take the risk
are not the end users anyway," because credit card companies
don't make customers pay for fraudulent bills. "If you called
up Visa today and asked how they ranked the risk, the lowest
risk transaction for them is over the Internet. It doesn't
jibe with what the media says."

Concern will subside as Internet shopping becomes more familiar
to the public, Hempel said. The Web has also given new life
to the venerable software tradition of shareware. A Web site
eliminates the need to convince online services and bulletin
board systems to offer a software application.

Software author Kenn Nesbitt sells his WebEdit HTML Editor for
Windows exclusively via his Web site (http://nesbitt.com/).
Web consultant Larry M. Edwards said Nesbitt's selling strategy
is ideal, because it targets only potential customers.

"Anybody working on the Web would want to use his product; people
who aren't working on the Web have absolutely no use for his
product," said San Diego-based Edwards, who helped bring the
America's Cup to the Internet as part of America's Cup Online.

However, Netscape's Hempel and Charles Gillespie, vice president
for publishing of San Diego-based Web content designer Bien
Logic, said companies with a substantial retail store presence
must be alert for potential conflicts if they set up shop on
the Web.

"There is a bit of a conflict of interest in cases of software
developers and others who have very strong relationships with
dealers and VAR resellers," Gillespie said. "They don't want
to jeopardize their points of sale by going online and undercutting
the price."

Retail Net: DONKEY BUSINESS



Two million preorders for Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong
Quest, combined with a production schedule that slipped slightly,
means serious shortages for Nintendo. The title shipped last
month, but Nintendo said it has only about 1 million copies
of the SNES game to ship to retailers.

Nintendo officials were evaluating which retailers would receive
orders. At the top of the list were those with advertising
commitments and consumer pre-orders. But deciding on allocation
"is not a pleasant task," said one Nintendo official. Meanwhile,
Toys R Us said it would give away a 128-page "Nintendo Official
Donkey Kong 2 Player's Guide," a $10 value that is full of
tips and techniques on clever ways to beat the game. With the
book, consumers will also receive a Feb. 1 game delivery guarantee
from Toys R Us.

In software, six out of seven Toys R Us shoppers did not know
the stores carried software, according to a survey commissioned
by the retailer. Nonetheless, one analyst said sales so far
could place Toys R Us among the top 10 retailers for educational
titles.

Edutainment titles at CES to feature 3-D technology

By:
KRISTEN KENEDY

With 3-D the talk of the industry for entertainment games, it's
no surprise that edutainment titles being announced this year
at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show also showcase the technology.
Learning programs from such publishers as Davidson & Associates
and The Learning Company also take advantage of 3-D worlds
to put more "entertainment" into edutainment. On the entertainment
front, watch for live-action video titles from PowerHouse Entertainment
as well as simulations and more game packs.

WizardWorks is capitalizing on the 3-D craze with a bundle of
three game titles popular at retail for their 360 degrees of
entertainment. The new 3-D Action Pack includes Terminal Velocity,
Rise of the Triad: The Hunt Begins and WarCraft. Suggested
retail price is $19.99.

PowerHouse Entertainment, which recently signed a deal to develop
two of its Moviegame live-action video titles for IBM Multimedia,
is launching its first game based on that same technology,
but with a twist.

At CES, the company will be announcing Collision, an arcade
style game with a live-action video component. However, unlike
some live-action entertainment titles in which movie clips
serve predominantly as a backdrop, Moviegame titles allow users
to interact with video in real time. The technology lets players
navigate through a live-action car demolition video while they
travel through the universe and attempt to destroy Spine, the
enemy leader, and his band of drones.

In order to live long enough to dispose of Spine, players must
use basic driving skills and radar to seek out and smash all
enemy cars while avoiding collisions with deadly opponents.
Along the way, they also must find weapons and equipment that
help them blast into the inner circle to do battle with Spine.

Meanwhile, The Jungle Book, PowerHouse's first title for IBM,
will ship this month. Picking up where the Disney movie left
off, players travel through the jungle and learn the language
of the monkeys in order to find and return the prized crown
of the Monkey King.

A proprietary technology developed by PowerHouse lets users
in these titles move from one video sequence to another without
an interruption in the action. The technology is intended to
let players feel a cause-and-effect relationship between the
action they take and the subsequent video they see on the screen.
The user interface-which can be an icon, a moving hot spot
or any object on the screen-is constantly responding to the
player's actions. For instance, the moving hot spots peppered
throughout the video create instant branching, making the flow
of action unpredictable.

In addition to deals with IBM, Power-House officials said they
are negotiating with several studios to create other Movie
Games for a holiday release this year.

The Learning Company is expected to show four new titles for
kids, including Logic Quest, a 3-D medieval learning adventure
for children ages 8 to 14.

The title develops essential thinking skills, requiring children
to navigate through 12 levels of challenging mazes, puzzles
and construction activities.

The Learning Company said the game provides a realistic 3-D,
first-person perspective of the medieval world as well as animated
3-D construction adventures.

Also showing is the Interactive Math Journey, the first product
in the Math Explorers Series, which will help develop basic
math skills and confidence for kids ages 6 to 9. It combines
exploration activities and traditional skill-building games.

Other titles include the Ultimate Writing and Creative Writing
Center and Reader Rabbit's Reading Development Library 3.

The Writing and Creativity Center is a full-featured word processor
that enables children ages 6 to 10 to create reports, storybooks,
newsletters, journals and signs. The Reader Rabbit Library
is the latest addition to the Learning Company's multilevel
series of interactive books. For kids ages 5 to 8, the titles
include The Princess and the Pea and The Goose That Laid the
Golden Egg.

Pricing for the titles is expected to range from $45 to $99.

Sanctuary Woods will be showing two entertainment titles as
well as a number of edutainment titles.

One of the titles aimed at the entertainment market is Lion,
a wildlife simulation in which players assume the role of a
lion in the African Serengeti. Users can choose to play as
a nomad or control an entire pride, selecting from among 20
lion characters, each with individual strengths and weaknesses.

Orion Burger, first announced at E3 last year, will also be
demonstrated. An outlandish, animated adventure game, Orion
Burger mixes an irreverent, humorous story line-involving alien
representatives scouring the universe for "unintelligent life"
to harvest for their "Orion Burger" chain of intergalactic
fast food joints-with a bizarre cast of characters.

Corbis, a software developer founded by Bill Gates to build
a comprehensive archive of high-quality imagery and multimedia
content, will be demonstrating three titles: Critical Mass
 America's Race to Build the Atomic Bomb; Paul Cezanne: Portrait
of My World; and Volcanoes: Life on the Edge.

A Productive, Though Crowded, 12 Months

By:
KRISTEN KENEDY

Like a teenager shaking off the awkward stages of childhood,
entertainment software struggled a step closer to maturity
in 1995.

And, just as children must adjust to the responsibilities of
adulthood, new technology in 1995 helped publishers improve
product quality, the retail channel learned to better manage
shelf space and product ordering, and mass merchandising techniques
and expanded channels brought software into the mainstream.

But these advances are also attracting more players into an
already saturated market, increasing dramatically the number
of products in the channel this year. Retailers are expected
to take mix management and analysis to the next level to counteract
that glut. And publishers, in turn, will be launching expanded
marketing programs and promotions.

While mergers, such as SoftKey's acquisition of the Learning
Company and MECC, or Sierra On-Line's buying binge that most
recently included Papyrus Software, topped the industry's most
talked-about list, many retailers said they expected the shakeout
to be more widespread. As a result, even more titles will be
competing for retail attention this year. More mergers are
guaranteed, as companies either make it in retail or align
themselves with the more powerful group of Master Publishers.
Nowhere will this trend be more evident than in edutainment,
where titles are more brand oriented and where some analysts
believe there is room for only a handful of players.

On a more positive note, perhaps one of the most significant
events this year for PC entertainment software was the launch
of Windows 95. In addition to improving the quality of PC games,
the auto-install feature in Microsoft's new operating system
simplified game loading significantly. Where users once had
to spend hours configuring a game to recognize sound boards
and other multimedia enhancements, the auto-install feature
transformed installation into a simple point and click procedure,
in most cases. Reducing that installation time was a definitive
milestone toward PC plug and play for the home user.

Already, leading developers are showing support for Windows
95. Electronic Arts, Activision and Acclaim, for example, have
announced that game titles this year will be Windows-95-native.

"Between better performance of video and audio, and Plug and
Play, Windows 95 is very appealing," said Eric Johnson, vice
president of marketing at Activision. "Computer [games] were
just kind of limited with Windows 3.1, and with DOS there are
still all these configuration problems. With Windows 95 you
just put the disk in and it boots up. On installation that
means the customer is happy and we have [fewer] technical support
calls."

Also improving the look and feel of games was the emergence
of the Pentium PC as the dominant system last year, as well
as the increased amount of RAM shipped in entry-level systems
and 3-D boards. With the low end becoming a Pentium 75 with
8M bytes of RAM, developers can write more sophisticated programs
that will take full advantage of the Pentium processing might.

Sega, for example, released its first games for the PC last
year but designed the titles specifically for the Pentium processor.
At launch time, Sega said only the power of the Pentium would
allow developers to create a game that would rival play on
its console systems. Its first three titles were Tomcat Alley,
Ecco The Dolphin and Comix Zone, all based on popular Sega
console games already in the market.

Software with 3-D environments topped the PC Data charts as
a host of boards shipped that make playing 3-D games faster
and better. Although the retail market has yet to see a significant
installed base in 3-D boards, publishers expect the boards
to be standard in PCs shipping for Christmas 1996. As such,
most are developing games that will at least perform better
when the card is present.

Enthusiasm for PC games did not put a damper on the next-generation
console platforms that were launched this year by Sony and
Sega. Although Sony has sold twice as many game systems in
the United States than Sega, analysts agree the ultimate test
will be the quality and number of console games available in
the market.

At press time, Sony PlayStation had sold about 500,000 units
in the United States, while Sega, which launched earlier, had
sold about 200,000 units.

The popularity of both platforms and a desire to capitalize
on development dollars will result in increased cross-platform
releases next year. Major developers, such as Sega and Acclaim
Entertainment, have said cross-platform will be a more important
strategic decision this year.

"When you are developing games with million dollar budgets for
a single title...it makes sense to amortize costs," said Domark
chief executive officer Dominic Wheatley.

While gamers were picking through a new breed of software, the
power of the child was recognized in brisk sales of edutainment
titles this past year. Special children's sections sprouted
in retail outlets, such as CompUSA and Computer City, and educational
retailers began to offer a variety of software applications.

Bringing new PC titles to the toy stores and other mass markets
is increasingly becoming the job of a new breed of distributors
that relied on exclusive contracts with retail outlets in order
to provide effective fulfillment and merchandising to those
accounts. This year New Media Express-a joint venture between
publisher Davidson & Associates and Mattel, the giant toy manufacturer
joined Good Times Interactive and Electronic Arts in providing
such services to mass merchants. Together with EA, NMX brought
a healthy mix of edutainment and entertainment software to
the giant Toys R Us chain, but also fueled an industry debate
about the propriety of such deals.

This year as the FTC continues an informal investigation into
some issues surrounding NMX, the controversy over this issue
will likely continue until traditional computer distributors
can offer the kind of fulfillment services and merchandising
needed to fuel entertainment software sales in the mass merchant
channel.

Another company that could play a role is Sega's new distribution
arm, which at press time still did not have an official name.
For retailers that don't have established EDI ordering systems,
Sega has sales teams equipped with special notebooks that can
place EDI orders directly from the retail store. Fulfillment
will be between 38 and 48 hours, said Tom Kalinske, president
of Sega of America.

Along with improving information systems, distributors and retailers
alike will continue a careful analysis of the product mix,
along with more powerful marketing and promotions aimed at
the mass market. With all parties wanting to reduce returns,
publishers and distributors are expected to assist retailers
even more with detailed product analysis.

"There is a ton of product looking for retail shelf space and
a lot of this stuff is undifferentiated from what came before,"
said John Taylor, president of Arcadia Investments. "If [retailers]
don't have strong marketing support, the product is going to
sit there and is not going to move."

Along with assisting each retailer with the appropriate product
mix on a per-store basis, publishers will also begin launching
more intense marketing efforts to help move products off the
shelves. Retailers will see more in-store promotions from publishers
as well as consumer advertising on a national level more commonplace
this year. Cross licensing will play an important role in marketing,
with many products piggybacking on campaigns for high-profile
films and television programs. Other publishers will seek to
license their titles and characters to media organizations
to build product recognition.

As important as the marketing plan this year is the training
of store managers and sales reps, publishers said. Recognizing
that these employees are the gateway to a consumer purchase,
many publishers are pledging to spend more time in the store
with training and promotions for store personnel. Publishers
said they recognize an informed employee will help ensure that
when products do hit the shelves, they won't stay there long
enough to ensure a premature death at retail.

Big Gain in '95 Means Profit in '96 -- Double-digit growth in
PC sales has retailers expecting better margins this year

By:
Roger C. Lanctot

If there is one lesson retailers learned in 1995, it was that
demand was strong enough that established players could begin
to experiment with higher prices. With a 45 percent gain in
retail sales and with overall sales up 38.3 percent, it was
clear to all market participants that computer merchandise
had moved squarely into the mass market.

In spite of the overall positive outlook, though, the final
quarter of the year left a cloud over 1996 prospects. Soft
sales for several computer retailers in November and December
gave pause to many.

The sales gains of 1995 were somewhat more modest than the wild
increases seen in the previous two years, but it was satisfaction
enough for most channel participants to top a terrific year
in 1994. It wasn't easy.

Best Buy took a comp-store sales beating in the first half of
1995, while it avoided taking a down-and-dirty position on
advertised prices. Eventually, the company was forced to take
the gloves off and go toe-to-toe with Circuit City Stores in
the crucial fourth quarter.

Having suffered that battle, though, Best Buy is now in a position
to notch impressive comp-store gains in 1996 without the shadow
of Windows 95 hanging over hardware systems and productivity
software sales. Look for a somewhat less aggressive Best Buy
in '96, and look for other retailers, such as Incredible Universe,
to follow suit.

After failing to achieve profitability in its third year of
operation and showing poor comp-store gains, Incredible Universe
found a new vice president, general manager in Henry Chiarelli.
Currently conducting a chainwide review of operations, Chiarelli
said changes are in store at Incredible Universe, including
a lower profile on price-matching.

"We don't want to be the most expensive guy on the block, but
we won't be the least expensive, either," he said. That is
a change from the division's original lowest-price-in-town
approach.

Computer City SuperCenters, another Tandy division, continues
to hold its ground on pricing, which contributed to negative
comp-store sales comparisons at the end of '95.

By now, it is clear that retailers have figured out how to create
a market in computer products. The challenge in '96 is to start
making money.

Hardware sales were up by 43.7 percent in 1995 vs. 1994, and
accounted for 70.6 percent of all computer-related merchandise
sales. Margins have always been narrow in hardware, but with
several vendors shifting printer and systems offerings into
minimum advertised price programs, and with Compaq cutting
its three-year warranty back, retailers are prepared to start
making money with hardware.

Similarly, in the software category, retailers and suppliers
turned to MAP programs and new captive distribution models.
The past year has demonstrated that demand is strong. Software
sales were up 26 percent in the retail market compared with
1994, with several distribution channels showing huge sales
gains in spite of plummeting prices.

The Big Keep Getting Bigger -- Strong sales in all categories
propel retail computer hardware and software sales above $23
billion

By:
MARIA V. GEORGIANIS

Heading into the fourth quarter last year, computer retailers
expressed cautious optimism about the strength of PC-related
sales. With such high expectations set in 1994, they wondered
if that year's multimedia PC boom would be repeated. What title
would emerge as the Myst of 1995? How far could Windows 95
Pentium PCs drive the market?

By all indications, there was nothing to worry about after all.
In the fourth quarter alone, combined sales from CompUSA, Computer
City SuperCenters, Circuit City Stores, Best Buy and Office
Depot were projected to increase to $3 billion-a 50 percent
jump over last year's period-according to market research firm
International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. These retailers
were anticipated to account for 40 percent of PCs sold through
consumer outlets and 20 percent of PCs sold in the United States.

CRW's list of 1995's Top 100 Computer Retailers found that the
market grew by 38.3 percent, coming off a 50 percent jump in
1994. In addition, the billion-dollar players' club grew to
five, and Best Buy surpassed $2 billion in computer merchandise
sales for the first time.

Micro Center nudged closer to the billion-dollar mark with sales
estimated at $930 million, generated by only 11 stores, while
Egghead Software backed off somewhat, to $890 million.

Micro Center had high- profile openings in Boston and Dallas,
launched its first stand-alone training center and introduced
the latest version of its WinBook private-label notebook, among
the top 10 selling notebooks overall in the United States,
according to IDC.

CRW's tally of the Top 10 computer retailers showed a few surprises,
particularly the substantial gains by the office superstores
all of which made the Top 10. CompUSA once again topped the
list with sales of $3.2 billion. Computer City spent the year
catching up to chief rival CompUSA. Last year, Computer City
entered 11 new markets, increased its promotional activity
with weekly four-color newspaper flyers and launched a direct
mail catalog. Computer City rounded out the year with 88 U.S.
stores, only seven shy of CompUSA's 95 store mark.

Best Buy predicted PC products would account for 38 percent
of fiscal 1996 sales, projected to surpass $7 billion. But
given the category's brutal margins and Best Buy's low-cost
operating model, the retailer said in the future it intended
to rein in the category to between 33 percent and 35 percent
of its sales. A 47 percent gain for Best Buy propelled the
company well above the $2.5 billion mark in computer-related
sales.

Top 10 competitor Circuit City more than doubled its sales of
computer-related merchandise and surprised the industry when
Hewlett-Packard selected it as the first retail chain to roll
out its Pavillion desktops. But with its commission-based model
more reliant on higher gross margins than that of noncommissioned
Best Buy, Circuit City saw fit to restrict the PC category
to the mid-20 percent range of its overall revenue.

Among the office-product superstores, only Office Depot once
again could claim to keep company with the likes of CompUSA
and Best Buy in the upper tier of the Top 10. As the largest
office-superstore operator, Office Depot was expected to post
revenue greater than $5 billion in its fiscal year ended last
December. Its impressive overall computer sales of $1.6 billion
ranked the retailer fourth among the Top 100 for the second
year in a row.

Last year, Office Depot pushed the envelope on its store format
with the debut of 50,000-square-foot mega-stores-double its
typical square footage-in Las Vegas and New York (its first
entry in that market). Historically, Office Depot's space allocation
to PC products has been about 2.5 times that of its competitors
OfficeMax and Staples, corresponding with PC sales 2.5 times
that of its rivals, noted Merrin Information Services, Palo
Alto, Calif.

Computer superstores, consumer electronics chains and office
products superstores are expected to post the greatest growth
rates in computer product revenue over the next three years,
according to Merrin. During that same period, the share of
PC-related sales is projected to decline among the department
stores/mass merchants, software stores and warehouse membership
clubs.

Nevertheless, participants in the latter three categories-Egghead
and Sears-made the Top 10 cut. Sam's did well, with a gain
of about 10 percent, but fell behind CDW Computer Warehouse,
Sears, OfficeMax and Staples. Wal-Mart had a 67 percent gain
in computer merchandise sales, but managed to drop a notch,
to 13th place on the list.

With its focus on productivity software, Egghead was a major
beneficiary of the launch of Windows 95. Although short of
management's expectations, comparable- store sales increased
20 percent following Windows 95's launch. Preliminary results
from Egghead's new retail format-anticipated to make the chain
more competitive with superstores-were also positive. Sales
in the first new-format store, opened in Beaverton, Ore., last
July, increased 61 percent during its second quarter, ended
Sept. 30, over 1994's same period. The 6,600-square- foot-store
was expanded from 2,600 square feet and put Egghead in the
PC hardware category for the first time. It also introduced
a more browser-friendly environment, with computer demo stations
and software merchandised by categories, similar to the merchandising
approach found in a bookstore.

On the downside, Egghead's corporate division, accounting for
about half of the company's overall sales, lost money in its
first two quarters. It was also expected to be unprofitable
in the third. Efforts to turn around the division were adversely
affected by the company's consolidation of its regional call
centers to its new Spokane, Wash., headquarters. Positioned
as an expense reducer, the relocation spoke volumes to the
industry. Its message? Only the nimble, low-cost operators
will survive.

While Egghead continued to close stores in its fiscal first,
second and fourth quarters, the company was expected to end
its current fiscal year with 10 new stores, most of which would
be of the new superstore variety. The company also said it
is moving rapidly to renovate existing stores. An overall sales
increase of 5 percent is expected for the fiscal fourth quarter
ending April 1996, according to a source close to the company.

The outlook for software specialists NeoStar and Electronics
Boutique remained bleak at year's end, although both chains
continue to open new stores both in and outside of malls. NeoStar
was expected to put the brakes on its downturn by year's end.

Media retailers MediaPlay, Virgin Megastore and Hastings continued
to improve in 1995, but greater gains are anticipated for 1996.

Bookstores Barnes & Noble and Borders failed to make the top
100 list in 1995, but '96 looks promising for these retailers
as well. However, vendors reported that Borders was finding
more success with software than Barnes & Noble, and NeoStar's
aggressive store-within-a-store strategy at B&N was not thought
to be finding success.

Toy stores flexed their muscles in '95, giving every indication
that they would be a force to be reckoned with in '96. And
educational toy retailers such as Imaginarium, Learningsmith
and Zany Brainy were seen as the true "sleepers" of 1995.

'Net Result: Hardware Boom -- Sales still grow despite chronic
product shortages and an uphill battle against eroding margins

By:
Gregory Quick

As surfing the 'net to get on the World Wide Web became the
raison d' tre for consumer PC purchases, multimedia was displaced
as the driving force behind soaring PC sales in 1995.

Overall, hardware sales soared at retail, growing 43.7 percent,
to $16.3- billion from $11.4 billion in 1994. The sales increase
includes strong growth across product categories such as memory,
monitors, hard drives, video and audio upgrades, scanners and
printers.

Hardware was the driving force behind most sales gains in '95,
with four retailers surpassing $1 billion in sales. CompUSA,
meanwhile, topped $2 billion in hardware sales.

These retailers succeeded despite vendors placing obstacles
in the path of growth, with select products in short supply
once again this year. Compaq, Apple and AST Research, among
others, were short on some popular products during the year.
And everybody that was still doing business with IBM had to
sit on their hands at one point or another waiting for goods.

Meanwhile, average PC prices declined prior to the Aug. 24 launch
of Windows 95, shot upward by several hundred dollars shortly
after the launch and have recently shown signs of spiraling
downward. But a greater concern for retailers has been declining
margins.

Retailers and their suppliers worked together in 1995 to curb
the margin decline by shifting to MAP programs and exclusive
PC offerings. For example, Power Computing unveiled its Macintosh
clones and signed an exclusive deal with Computer City. The
new year should bring more of the same.

The critical issue for the market leaders in hardware sales
is that systems sales generate traffic, which, in turn, generates
sales in the software, accessories and supplies departments.

The downside of systems sales, though, is that vendors have
bundled so much hardware and software in the systems that some
upgrade opportunities are beginning to evaporate, even as retailers
are putting in the infrastructure to support in-home and in
store upgrades.

Sales Climb and Barriers Fall -- Office and consumer-electronics
superstore sales soar, while mall players struggle

By:
Kathleen Richards

In 1995, total retail software sales increased 26 percent, to
$4.1 billion, from $3.5 billion in 1994, according to CRW estimates.

Retail sales of CD-ROM software doubled in both dollars and
units in 1995, driven in part by a robust holiday season in
1994.

The lower cost of goods, combined with a higher average price
for CD-ROM products, meant CD-ROM publishers enjoyed higher
gross margins and a broader retail channel that now included
mass merchants, bookstores, video and music retailers, and
supermarkets.

At the same time, the old guard-software specialty retailers
and computer superstores-had to rethink merchandising, store
formats and pricing strategies as consumer electronics stores,
office-product superstores and warehouse clubs continued to
capture greater market share.

Egghead, the top software retailer in 1994 according to CRW
estimates, maintained its status this year with $735 million
in software sales, down from $750 million in 1994.

Computer superstores continued their reign on the top 10 software
retailer list, benefitting more than other retailers in the
third quarter from Microsoft's release of the Windows 95 operating
system.

Indeed, these stores augmented their market share to 33 percent
in October, from 24 percent in July, according to Storeboard
Channel Tracking, a research division of Computer Intelligence
InfoCorp., La Jolla, Calif. Still, CRW estimates show the overall
share of retail software sales declining, from 35.4 percent
in 1994 to 33.1 percent in 1995 for computer superstores.

Despite widespread claims that software specialty retailers
continue to lose market share faced with decreasing margins
and increased competition, Egghead, NeoStar Retail Group and
Electronics Boutique maintained their top 10 status. But their
share of sales fell to 28.8 percent from 35.4 percent.

This year, office-product superstores increased software visibility,
picking up more categories and cashing in on greater demand,
driven in part by Windows 95. Office Depot increased total
software sales to $122 million from $71.5 million last year.
OfficeMax and Staples posted substantial gains.

Applauding the Best , Brightest -- Overdue recognition for retail
innovators

By:
Roger C. Lanctot

When some of the largest retailers are recognized as computer
retailing's best and brightest by their suppliers, it may not
come as a surprise. But when Computer Retail Week asked 200
top channel sales executives to vote, we asked them to recognize
performance, not reputation.

The fact that "the usual suspects" captured the lion's share
of the awards should not obscure the fact that 43 different
retailers received at least one vote in one or more of 10 categories.
The retailers cited in this report stand out for their ability
to find new solutions to old problems and to persevere in a
merciless marketplace. The recognition they receive here is
long overdue.

The Most Knowledgeable Sales Professionals -- Those computer
retailers that offer the best training and the best opportunites
for career advancement retain the best sales staff

By:
LINDA KAZARES

There are several components to hiring, developing and retaining
good selling talent. Most important are career track opportunities,
training and compensation.

Career retail sales individuals are committed to retailing.
Their job satisfaction depends on how well they are integrated
into the company and what career path they can expect at the
company. Income is directly tied to performance.

How the retailer perceives and treats sales employees has a
huge impact on performance and retention. If sales personnel
are treated like professionals and offered training, they are
more likely to perform well.

Such is the case at Incredible Universe, where sales employees
can boost their salaries with accumulated training credits.

Micro Center sales associates are expected to present themselves
professionally, including wearing business attire and having
complete knowledge of the products they are selling.

The store sales personnel who perform best have an interest
in keeping themselves abreast of the latest technology, consider
the job their career and know what their contribution is to
their employer's success.

Linda Kazares serves as the president of Ambit International,
a consulting and research firm based in San Francisco.

The Best Merchandising Strategy -- The best in-store merchandising
improves both the shopping experience for the shopper and the
profitability for the retailer

By:
Stephen Baker

Today's best in-store merchandising adds value to the shopping
experience while improving profitability for the retailer.

When more retailers are selling the same products at the same
prices, getting customers into the store is not enough. They
need to be satisfied when they leave and excited about returning.
Merchandising makes all the difference.

If retail is detail, then merchandising is the heart of the
detail. Customers will never notice good merchandising, but
bad merchandising sticks out like a sore thumb. Logical product
categorization makes finding products a breeze, and good adjacencies
remind buyers to purchase everything they need.

Shelf price tags should be correct and product spec sheets accurate,
up-to-date and available. Eye-level end caps should be reserved
for products that sell. Product displays should show the wide
variety of product on hand.

Good merchandising generates repeat business and profitability.
High visibility for high-margin, high-turnover products, and
cross-merchandising that raises the average ring are all profit
enhancers that are good merchandising techniques.

Stephen Baker is a computer industry analyst at International
Data Corp., based in Framingham, Mass.

The Most Effective Store Layout -- A successful store layout
is one that combines good floor planning with elements of education
and entertainment

By:
J'Amy Owens

A successful store layout-one that encourages customer "dwell
time" and ensures sales-combines good floor planning with elements
of education and entertainment.

Customers should be able to shop the store from the door. Best
Buy, for one, combines high-bay racking around the perimeter
of the store and low gondolas in the middle to create an understandable,
easily negotiable environment.

A natural partner to the shop-from-the-door idea is an effective
and compelling circulation path. To get customers to the back
wall, retailers need to create a way for them to get there
and reasons why they should. The winners are retailers that
combine a racetrack or ziggurat configuration with fun, interactive
areas along the way.

Nebraska Furniture Mart's Mega Mart "infocaps" teach customers
about specific products or services. CompUSA's Logitech strike
zones entertain shoppers with lively, interactive displays
set in areas on the floorplate where they're sure to walk.
These are two examples of the many elements of a successful
format. Congratulations to this year's winners. We can all
learn something from you.

J'Amy Owens serves as the president of The Retail Group, a retail
consulting firm located in Redmond, Wash.

The Best Interactive Merchandising -- Savvy computer retailers
recognize the bottom-line impact of a dollar invested in dynamic,
interactive merchandising tools

By:
Jim Alexander

In an industry where more than two-thirds of buying decisions
are made at retail, savvy computer retailers recognize the
bottom-line impact of a dollar invested in dynamic, interactive
merchandising tools that dazzle and capture the attention of
customers.

Frost & Sullivan, a New York-based market research firm, foresees
billions of dollars in sales associated with the use of interactive
advertising technology, or kiosks. Kiosks can supplement and
train a retailer's sales staff, provide direct product fulfillment,
increase customer knowledge and satisfaction, and provide useful
market data. Also, their full-motion video, animation, sound
and touch-screen technology move people to action.

Other popular merchandising tools include custom store videos,
video walls, hands-on multimedia computer displays and information
centers. In 1996, kiosks will become one-stop shopping machines.
The Internet will also play a role educating potential customers
about both retailers and new products, and facilitate interaction
between manufacturers, retailers and the general public.

Jim Alexander serves as the president of Merchandising Solutions,
a marketing and consulting firm based in El Segundo, Calif.

The Best Marketing Program -- Although it's easier said than
done, the best retailers, including the three nominees, know
their clientele and give them what they want

By:
ADAM LEVIN

Good marketing boils down to doing two things really well: Knowing
who your target customer is and knowing what influences his
or her purchases.

More specifically, it is making sure that the marketing campaign
being used by the retailer is designed around the factors that
will make target customers buy from them. It sounds simple;
everyone should be able to do this. Yet, in the retail PC industry,
almost every retailer fails miserably and spends millions of
vendor dollars (and a little bit of their own) in doing so.

The key point is knowing your target customers. Many retailers
are still targeting the majority of their marketing efforts
to the first-time system buyer, yet the majority of systems
sold in the U.S. market today are sold to second-time buyers.
Second-time buyers want to buy high-end, full-featured machines
or want to be able to upgrade and enhance their existing PCs.
They want selection, and they want to buy when they're ready
not when the retailer decides it is a good week to feature
computers. And they want a very good justification to make
the purchase today.

The best retailers, including the three top nominees, recognize
this and market accordingly. Knowing the customers, and giving
them what they want-now that is a marketing philosophy to live
by.

The Best Pricing Strategy -- After years of increasingly brutal
price wars, retailers, particularly computer and consumer electronics
superstores, look to implement higher-margin business models

By:
PHIL MAGNEY

Low-cost, high-volume retailing is the fundamental approach
behind superstore retailing, but this strategy is evolving
into a higher-margin model.

CompUSA no longer regards "lowest prices" as its primary competitive
advantage. By comparison, other retailers that compete with
CompUSA may be as much as 10 percent lower in price on a given
product-sometimes at, or below, cost. CompUSA is now more likely
to charge what the market will bear, at prices that earn 10
percent to 15 percent gross margins.

Micro Center, Computer City and Fry's Electronics are beginning
to represent the high end of retail. Vendors note that Fry's,
in particular, almost always sells products above their minimum
advertised prices. Customers at these stores may be more experienced
and willing to pay more than those at Best Buy or Circuit City
for better selection and service.

Best Buy no longer "low-balls." The retailer starts high (say
12 percent to 16 percent margin) and then works prices down
as conditions warrant. Best Buy may still be the best price
in town, with "7 Percent Over Cost" sales, but these sales
typically last for only a few days.

Despite store-opening blitzes from Micro Center and occasional
clearance sales, today's retail market presents a pricing spectrum
increasingly bent toward the high end.

The Best In Broadcast Advertising -- Stores should drive their
own brand-name awareness and loyalty, while pushing price out
of the driver's seat

By:
PAUL GIGANTE

While bringing customers into your store is the No. 1 objective
of retail advertising, building your store's brand (i.e., your
store's name) is just as important. Ironically, while all retailers
recognize the value of listing the brand names of the merchandise
they sell as well as the weight those names carry in terms
of quality and loyalty, they seldom recognize the value of
their own brand image.

In a price war, those retailers with the strongest brand loyalty
will win every time over those that do little more than publish
price lists. Look at the success of CompUSA, Circuit City Stores
and Office Depot. They've each built their own distinct image
and personality, providing their customers with a reason to
come back time and again to enjoy the shopping experience.

What separates effective retail advertising from typical efforts
is advertising that answers a simple question: Why come into
my store rather than my competitor's? Like any effective advertising,
effective retail advertising creates emotional bonds between
store and customer through a consistent voice.

Retailers cannot drive traffic consistently at the exclusion
of their brand image. Only by building brand image and loyalty
while driving traffic will retailers keep customers coming
back again and again.

Advertising, New York.

The Best Print Advertising -- Effective print advertising must
reflect the personality of the company and its customers. It
must be derived from clear objectives, such as building brand
awareness

By:
PETER JANSSEN

Advertising is like the stock market. The "experts" can't agree,
yet everyone has an opinion. But in the simplest of terms,
advertising is good if it works!

Effective print advertising is derived from a clear and crisp
objective, such as driving sales, building brand awareness
or informing the public. Print advertising can be more efficient
than broadcast advertising.

Either way, advertising must include a "call to action." Good
ads reflect the personality of the company and its customers.
But to be effective, advertising plans must achieve critical
mass.

Most retailers jam too much in their ads to appeal to the broadest
customer demographic and capture the greatest amount of supplier
funding. Consequently, it can be difficult to differentiate
one retailer's ad from another.

The personal-computer industry could use more ads that attempt
to inform and educate the consumer.

Based on the available demographic data, we know that we are
speaking to an intelligent consumer who is thirsty for information.
Consumers ask, for example, "How real is the obsolescence factor?"
and "How much memory do I really need?"

Among the best at answering these questions are Best Buy, CompUSA
and Computer City SuperCenters.

Peter Janssen, a computer retailing and manufacturing executive,
is president of Peter Janssen & Associates, Seattle.

The Most Efficient Distribution of Products -- Few are able
to consistently get the right product to the right place at
the right time in the right quantities

By:
Roger C. Lanctot

The great distribution debacles of '93 and '94 (Acer and Dell
at Wal-Mart, Best Buy's out of stocks) are now but a faint
glimmer in the rearview mirror as the retail computer industry
glides into 1996. By this time, retailers have learned that
the computer merchandising model is so tight and the margin
opportunity so narrow that there is little room for error.

Windows 95's arrival sorely tested the distribution acumen of
all channel participants. From coordinating special events
to ratcheting down purchases of systems with Windows 3.1 while
cranking up purchases of PCs loaded with Windows 95, retailers
had their hands full.

That experience taught all retailers that excellent product
distribution involves good forecasting, dependable infrastructure
and systems, reliable personnel and strong vendor relationships.
A little good fortune helps, but successful retailers make
opportunities happen with sound planning and execution.

Still, even the most skilled merchants are always learning,
and no replenishment scheme, however elegant, is beyond improvement.
The new year promises to be yet a new test.

Roger C. Lanctot is CRW's editorial research director.

The Most Effective Sales Training Program -- Those computer
software and hardware retailers that take time to lay a sound
foundation of sales and administrative skills benefit every
day

By:
SEYMOUR MERRIN

Training a retail rep in today's market is a daunting task.
Trying to match numerous SKUs and their complex features and
benefits to a baffling array of customers can be overwhelming.

The first challenge that retailers face is laying a foundation
of product knowledge, customer awareness and store procedures.
Sales associates must know products' gross specifications,
where individual SKUs are shelved, where customers can get
comparative information and what's on sale. These are fundamental
bits of information, without which the sales associate will
fail.

Sales associates must also have some knowledge of general category
characteristics. What do the specs actually mean? How will
the customer perceive the performance of the product?

It's also critical for associates to know the store's sales
and administrative procedures, so that the actual purchasing
process for customers can be as painless as possible.

Once these basics are taught and reinforced, then individual
vendor information may be introduced. Retailers that lay a
sound foundation of sales and administrative skills reap the
benefits every day.

Seymour Merrin is president of Merrin Information Systems, Palo
Alto, Calif., and a frequent contributor to CRW.

Have Screwdriver, Will Moonlight -- Some sales reps offer high
tech house calls

By:
Maria V Georgianis

SAN MATEO, CALIF.-As ever-increasing numbers of consumers buy
their first personal computers, retail sales associates are
joining the ranks of police, plumbers and electricians in an
age-old practice: moonlighting.

Sales associates are parlaying technical expertise into extra
earnings by helping customers get products up and running once
they leave the store.

"I do it all the time," said a Staples sales associate in Southern
California who asked not to be identified. "I only set up the
systems that I sell, so Staples benefits from it. I wait until
I get off work and set a scheduled time for the customer, with
a fee of $20 to $30 per hour."

A consumer might pay about $50 for the same services from an
independent contractor, the sales associate estimated. As long
as it doesn't affect his work in the store, the sales associate
said, his manager approves of his helping Staples customers
at their homes.

The sales associate, who said he doesn't solicit such business
from customers or hand out his business cards in the store,
only offers his services when customers ask if they are available.

"I've been doing it for two years," he said, adding that customers
recognize his particular store as very service-oriented because
of his efforts.

A Staples spokeswoman said the company has not established a
policy regarding house calls.

"We don't officially have anything set to send associates to
homes, but we don't have a policy saying associates shouldn't
do things to help customers outside of Staples," she said.
"Staples is constantly reviewing the marketplace and the services
it offers."

Not all retail management approves of moonlighting by sales
associates, however, and some prohibit it outright.

Any sales associates contemplating moonlighting should be clear
on an employer's stated or unofficial moonlighting policy.

"A lot of my techs won't take [the chance] because of the repercussions,"
said an OfficeMax computer supervisor in a Northern California
store. "Making $20 to $40 [on the side] isn't worth losing
a $300 paycheck."

After establishing that you won't jeopardize your job by moonlighting
for your store's customers, make sure you are technically up
to speed. If you don't do this, you risk damaging a customer's
computer equipment, your employer's reputation and your own
job.

CompTIA, Lombard, Ill., is a not-for-profit professional organization
that developed a personal-computer technical proficiency exam
administered by training and testing centers nationwide.

The ability to pass CompTIA's A+ certification program examination
is widely recognized as a strong measure of comprehensive personal
computer competency.

Whether or not you have A+ certification, be up-front with customers
about your abilities. Explain that services you provide are
on your own time and do not involve your employer. This minimizes
the risk if a problem arises in the course of servicing, upgrading
and setting up a customer's equipment, particularly if the
problem is neither your own fault nor your employer's.

Another piece of advice for would-be moonlighters: Be patient
with customers.

Many beginners are looking for basic training with their computer.
While you may find the process of teaching the basics tedious,
your experience is valuable and can build an ongoing, potentially
lucrative customer relationship.

Providing such personalized customer service on the side "usually
creates more sales for the store," said a manager of a Babbage's
in the Midwest. "There are people who will buy products from
us even if something costs $5 or $10 more [than at a competitor],
because they know someone here can help them with it."

He occasionally offers his services as a consultant to customers
for $20 an hour, although at most, he said, he probably earns
$200 a year from such moonlighting.

Like the Staples sales associate, the Babbage's manager said
he doesn't offer his services unless a customer asks for help.
He believes Babbage's unofficially approves of moonlighting,
within reason.

"We're not allowed to say, 'Buy this hard drive, and I'll install
it for you,' " the manager said. He said he realizes his employer
may be concerned that sales associates would take advantage
of the situation by selling some products and then telling
customers their systems require an upgrade related to that
purchase.

The manager said he ends up helping customers by telephone more
often than making house calls. Babbage's wholeheartedly endorses
this practice, he said.

A spokeswoman for Babbage's said sales associates are not permitted
to make house calls, regardless of whether or not a customer
requests such service.

According to some store managers, employers' concerns regarding
moonlighting center primarily on a store's potential exposure
if a customer is unhappy with the services performed.

"It's not about the money; it's about trying to control the
interaction of the customer and the salesperson," said a manager
at a Doppler Computer store in Seattle. "You can't control
what the employee does once they leave the store. If they do
something that upsets the customer, it reflects poorly on the
[retailer]. The worst-case scenario would be if something was
stolen from a customer's home."

The Doppler manager said the issue came up with an employee
who had his own computer consulting firm and was soliciting
customers for work outside the store. That sales associate
was warned not to solicit customers for his consulting business
from the store floor. Doppler moved to formally prohibit its
sales associates from soliciting outside business in its employee
manual, the manager said.

Among retailers offering in-home support-a service that is becoming
more widely available-sales associates are foolish to risk
competing with their employers.

Sales associates interviewed by CRW said they provide services
not offered by their employers, such as installing hard drives
and extra memory, or teaching users the basics of the Windows
and DOS operating systems.

Because they weren't duplicating services their employers sell,
most felt there was no conflict of interest. Others at retailers
that offer in-home or other technical services said they help
customers for free.

Secret Shopper: CompUSA



Philadelphia, Sat., Dec. 9 , 2p.m.

OBSERVATIONS: At the peak of the holiday selling season, the
Secret Shopper descended on the City of Brotherly Love in search
of joysticks to use with Interplay's hit entertainment title,
Descent.

Joystick sales and product offerings have recently experienced
explosive growth. The Secret Shopper wanted to find out whether
sales associates know which of the new joysticks work best
with Descent, and whether they know their triggers from their
fire buttons overall.

The Secret Shopper entered the store to find it teeming with
customers, mostly families with small children in tow.

The store's signage, both hanging and on shelves, was plentiful.
The Secret Shopper used it to find the aisle where joysticks
were located, toward the middle of the store.

After locating the joysticks, the Secret Shopper took some time
and perused the shelf, since every sales associate in the area
was busy waiting on other customers. It was a full 10 to 15
minutes before a harried sales associate approached offering
help.

The Secret Shopper asked the sales associate which joysticks
work best with Descent. The sales associate responded with
questions of his own. His first questions were designed to
learn about the Shopper's system. He asked about such specifics
as the system's memory and available ports. He also asked which
software titles were on that system, and whether the Secret
Shopper already owned Descent. After establishing that the
Secret Shopper was indeed just looking for a joystick, he got
down to business.

"How much do you want to spend?" he asked. Assured that the
Secret Shopper was an avid gamer and money was no object, he
pointed toward the ThrustMaster MarkII Flight Control System,
explaining that it was very intuitive and ergonomic, and that
it would work with a variety of games.

This didn't surprise the Secret Shopper, since the ThrustMaster
model was the most expensive on the shelf. It carried an $89.99
price tag.

In addition to the ThrustMaster stick, CompUSA carried a wide
variety of joysticks, including several from Microsoft, Logitech
and Advanced Gravis.

After making a recommendation, the sales associate excused himself
to wait on a family of four whose members looked like they
might be interested in something that cost more than a $90
joystick.

The Secret Shopper didn't feel slighted, since the sales associate
had been helpful. As he excused himself, he told the Secret
Shopper to think it over, and offered to answer any other questions.

All told, the sales associate spent about 10 minutes answering
the Secret Shopper's questions-impressive since the store was
overrun with holiday shoppers, several of whom cast Scrooge
like glances at the Secret Shopper for monopolizing the sales
representative's time.

The CRW Staff

EnTry-Level: Acer Aspire 2710

Price:

Typically sells at $1,500 to $2,000

Features:

These products generally ship with 14,400-bps internal voice
data fax modems incorporating at least a basic speakerphone
and microphone. Quad-speed CD-ROM is standard in this class.
Monitors generally bundled with PCs at this level typically
are 14-inch, .28 dot-pitch models. Audio components typically
include a 16-bit FM-synthesis sound card and 4-to-12-watt-per
channel powered satellite speakers. Built-in MPEG capabilities,
which are designed for scaling full-motion video footage on
screen, are software-based in this class of products.

Configuration:

These systems generally are powered by a 75MHz to 100MHz Pentium
processor, and include a minimum 850M-byte hard drive and

8M bytes of RAM.

Software:

All systems ship with productivity applications, CD-ROM-based
games, edutainment titles, communications software, telephone
answering machine and online packages and a vendor-developed
"front end" for navigating Windows 95.

Mid-range: IBM Aptiva M63

Price:

Typically sells at $2,000 to $2,500

Features:

These products ship with at least a 19,200-bps, and often a
28,800-bps, internal voice/data fax modem incorporating a full
duplex speakerphone and microphone, allowing parties to speak
and be heard by each other simultaneously. Quad-speed CD-ROM
is still standard. Monitors bundled with PCs at this level
typically are either 14-inch or 15-inch .28 dot-pitch models.
Audio components usually include a 16-bit wavetable sound card,
3-D sound synthesis and 10-to-20-watt-per-channel powered satellite
speakers. Some vendors offer hardware-assisted built-in MPEG
capabilities at this level.

Configuration:

These systems typically are powered by a 100MHz to 120MHz Pentium
processor, and generally ship with 8M bytes of RAM and a 1G
byte to 1.2G-byte hard drive.

Software:

Systems at this level ship with the same applications found
in entry-level models. Some add graphics-intensive CD-ROM games
that take advantage of built-in MPEG capabilities, and full
versions of office-suite and desktop video-editing packages.

High-End: Compaq Presario 9564

Price:

Typically sells at more than $2,500

Features:

These products ship with 28,800-bps internal voice/data fax
modems incorporating a full-duplex speakerphone and microphone.
Quad-speed CD-ROM is standard; some vendors offer six-speed
drives. Monitors bundled with PCs at this level typically are
either 15-inch or 17-inch .28 dot-pitch models. Audio components
usually include a 16-bit wavetable sound card, 3-D sound synthesis
and 30-watt-per-channel powered satellite speakers, sometimes
with bass modules. Some vendors offer hardware-assisted built
in MPEG capabilities at this level. Most products at this level
are available in minitower designs that provide extra expansion
options.

Configuration:

These systems typically are powered by a 133MHz to 150MHz Pentium
processor, and generally ship with 16M bytes of RAM and a 1.6G
byte to 2G-byte hard drive.

Software:

Again, systems at this level ship with the same applications
found in entry-level models, but add graphics-intensive MPEG
based CD-ROM games and full-fledged office-suite and desktop
video-editing packages.

Qualifiers :

Who will use the system: adults, children or both? Is the customer
a first-time buyer, or a second- or third-round purchaser?
Will the computer be used primarily for basic productivity
chores, such as word processing and home finances? Is the customer
a hard-core gamer or 'net surfer? Is the ability to run desktop
full-motion video or reproduce high-fidelity audio high on
the customer's wish list?

The Pitch:

Entry-level systems are adequate for running basic productivity
applications, such as word processing and home-finance packages.
Midrange systems and their faster modems are better suited
to file downloading on commercial online services or the Internet.
High-end systems deliver heavy-duty graphics performance, audiophile
sound and full-motion, full-screen desktop video capabilities.

Step-Up:

Demonstrating hardware-assisted MPEG capabilities found in some
midrange and high-end systems is a quick way to convince some
customers, especially hard-core gamers and graphics-oriented
users, to step up from entry-level models. Ditto for sound
demonstrations that showcase 3-D and wavetable audio, as well
as wider frequency response, found in midlevel and top-end
systems.

The Close:

Recommend an entry-level system to first-time buyers who are
uncertain which applications they will run on their new computer.
Moderate to hard-core gamers and online aficionados will appreciate
the improved communications and processing performance of a
midrange system. Audiophiles, graphics professionals and desktop
video directors will want nothing less than a high-end system.

CD-ROM to drive changes seen for '96 -- Win95 Likely To Dominate
Platforms At Retail Level

By:
Kathleen Richards

NEW YORK-CD-ROM will likely be the predominant media sold by
computer retailers this year-one of several significant shifts
expected in 1996.

Once strictly viewed as a productivity tool, software has expanded
with the advent of CD-ROM to include content-based titles that
inform as well as aid users. With the popularity of CD-ROM
come numerous questions regarding packaging, shelf space, fixtures
and preview mechanisms for the consumer confronted by thousands
of titles.

By October 1995, CD-ROM titles represented 47 percent of all
software units sold through retail and 40 percent of retail
software dollars- almost double the percentages year-over-year
from 1994, according to market research firm PC Data, Reston,
Va.

Similarly, static applications that provide content that becomes
out of date as soon as the disc is pressed are starting to
evolve into dynamic programs that link to online databases
with up-to-the-minute information.

Meanwhile, Windows 95 is still expected to drive productivity
software sales in 1996 as more business users migrate from
Windows 3.1 to the Windows 95 operating system.

The majority of retail PCs will ship with the 32-bit version
of Windows pre-installed, further increasing the demand for
native Windows 95 applications.

Many companies, however, may bypass Windows 95 and upgrade to
the more powerful next version of the Windows NT operating
system, code-named Cairo, which will offer a Windows 95 shell.
Cairo is expected to reach beta late this year and ship in
1997.

Although Microsoft indicated that it would not release interim
versions of Windows 95, the company will offer service packs
that feature drivers and other upgrades, which are also available
through the company's Web site.

This month, Microsoft is expected to offer the first Windows
95 Service Pack, which will feature client codes for NetWare
4.1, an upgrade to the Internet Explorer browser, infrared
transmission port drivers, ISDN support and updated device
drivers for video and sound cards. The company will not sell
the service packs through retail.

Windows 96, code-named Nashville, is scheduled for release this
year, but has been characterized by the company as a minor
Windows 95 upgrade. This version will focus on Internet integration
throughout the operating system, according to company officials.
Microsoft has not committed to a release date.

The number of Windows 95 applications reaching the channel will
increase exponentially this year as the majority of Windows
titles are developed as native 32-bit Windows applications.

In the first quarter, IBM subsidiary Lotus is slated to release
1-2-3 96 for Windows 95 and Organizer 96 for Windows 95, rounding
out its suite of native Windows 95 applications in SmartSuite
96, which shipped in November.

Graphics powerhouse Adobe plans to ship several native Windows
95 applications in the first quarter, including Adobe Illustrator,
Adobe Persuasion, Adobe Acrobat 2.0 and Adobe Type Manager.

While analysts who predicted a software shift to Windows 95
in 1995 were overly optimistic, this year at retail the 32
bit operating system is likely to become the dominant Windows
platform.

In October 1995, total sales of Windows 95 products represented
15 percent of unit sales and 20 percent of retail software
dollars, according to PC Data. Windows 3.1 still dominated
retail software dollar sales in 1995 for the year-to-date through
October with a 40 percent market share, followed by DOS with
19 percent, Macintosh with 17 percent, Windows 95 with 9 percent,
hybrid products with 6 percent and OS/2 with a 0.61 percent
retail market share.

Nevertheless, IBM is ringing in 1996 with strategic plans for
its OS/2 Warp line of products. Apple Computer is expected
to release a new version of its operating system this year,
code-named Copland, which offers interface enhancements, more
multimedia capabilities and a shell that supports multitasking.

Also this year, the threat of online applications and services
will loom larger.

Microsoft released one online program last fall, CarSource,
that may serve as a model for software to follow. The client
software is free to Microsoft Network subscribers who, in effect,
have the option to download a "form" and then access dynamic
consumer car reports from the Microsoft Network. The primary
benefit is that users have access to the latest information,
such as pricing.

This year, Microsoft plans to release three or more additional
online-only programs, said Marty Taucher, senior group marketing
manager, Microsoft Consumer Division.

The company will also pursue the opportunity to offer extensions
of shrinkwrapped products online. For example, small-business
add-ons or templates could be offered for products such as
Microsoft Works or Microsoft Publisher, said Taucher.

Other publishers are expected to follow Microsoft's lead.

In 1996, accessing the Internet may seem like last year's hot
trend. However, many productivity releases will ship with Internet
browsers and offer free access to publishers' Web sites for
more information on company products and enhancements to existing
software.

Online links may also start to change the traditional upgrade
path. Publishers that have online connections to users' desktops
instantly increase options regarding product promotions, minor
upgrades and information dissemination.

A whirl of mergers and acquisitions changed the face of the
software industry in 1995, and more of the same is expected
in 1996 as larger publishers build extensive product libraries,
often targeting a range of price points and affiliate-label
programs.

This month, the fate of Novell's applications group, namely
WordPerfect and the PerfectOffice suite of applications, may
come to light. Novell has pledged to finalize the sale by the
end of January to coincide with the end of the company's first
fiscal quarter.

Novell's announcement to sell the division last fall has stalled
product cycles, delaying the release of the Windows 95 version
of PerfectOffice, which was originally slated to ship in this
quarter. The uncertain status of Novell's applications group
has also temporarily halted plans to roll out SelectOffice,
an innovative retail program that would allow users to essentially
build their own customized suite by sampling 50 titles on a
CD-ROM and then buying the desired programs. The CD-ROM, which
would offer several free titles, could be purchased for a nominal
fee. Retailers were to receive margins on each title selected,
even if the software was not carried by the storefront.

Another trend last year had leading publishers seeking market
share in the value-priced category, a phenomenon partly driven
by the success of companies such as SoftKey International and
Expert Software. One publisher, however, will not try to sell
titles priced less than $20.

"It may be our mistake, but Microsoft will not actively participate
in the budget category," said Microsoft's Taucher.

SOFTWARE DISPATCH: Productivity software may be hard to locate
this week at CES amid the edutainment and entertainment titles
crowding the show floor. Nevertheless, several publishers will
show productivity titles worth checking out.

Specom Technologies, Santa Clara, Calif., is demonstrating a
$49.50 video-conferencing title called VisionTime Pro. The
software allows small-business users to send video, graphics
and text over standard telephone lines when used with a modem,
a video capture card and a camcorder. VisionTime Pro also supports
ISDN lines. This Windows 3.1 application shows both the remote
video and local video whiteboard onscreen. It supports document
conferencing with simultaneous voice, provided that the user
has a DSVD modem. High-resolution images from TWAIN-compliant
devices such as scanners can be transmitted to the receiver
or saved for later use. In addition, users have the ability
to add drawings or text to video. The company promotes the
software as a video-conferencing solution for notebook users
with a PCMCIA video capture card.

Specom Technologies is developing an Internet version of VisionTime
Pro, scheduled for release in the first quarter of 1996.

Syracuse Language Systems, Syracuse, N.Y., is showing three
titles from the Living Language Multimedia series. Let's Talk
is a four-language vocabulary builder in Spanish, French, German
and Italian that supports speech recognition. This Windows
3.1 CD-ROM has an expected street price of $29.95. Also on
display are two full-language learning titles that the company
shipped in October: Spanish Your Way and French Your Way. Both
titles incorporate speech recognition-the software evaluates
a user's pronunciation-and ship with a microphone plus an audio
cassette that contains conversations. Each title has an $89.95
expected street price.

Not available for viewing at CES-but worth noting-is the latest
3-D effects title from Visual Software, Woodland Hills, Calif.
Instant 3D for Windows 95 lets users enhance Windows 95 documents
or presentations with 3-D text and images. It features hundreds
of 3-D clip-art objects and textures that can be scaled or
edited in a 3-D window. Instant 3D for Windows 95 follows close
on the heels of the company's Simply 3D, a Windows 3.1 title.
The SRP for Instant 3D is $49. The software is bundled with
the Micrografx ABC Graphics Suite.

Year in Review '95 -- Strong Showing For CD-ROM, Internet Apps

By:
KATHLEEN RICHARDS

Retail sales of CD-ROM software doubled in both dollars and
units in 1995, driven in part by a robust holiday season in
1994 during which sales of multimedia PCs soared.

By October, CD-ROMs represented 47 percent of all software units
sold through retail and 40 percent of software dollars, up
from about 20 percent in both units and dollars in the year
ago period, according to research firm PC Data, Reston, Va.

Minimum advertised pricing, long a standard policy for hardware,
became evident in leading software programs in January, as
Novell created a MAP program for its retail applications, set
to begin in April, which would penalize retailers that advertised
products below a minimum set price.

When April arrived, Novell had discontinued its Main Street
line after several merchandising and branding strategies failed
to increase market share, and planned to roll out 15 revamped
titles under the PerfectHome brand. By July, the Consumer Products
Division had been renamed the Personal Access Division, and
the focus was shifted to applications with links to online
services.

In November, Novell announced plans to sell off the applications
group, which included WordPerfect and the PerfectOffice suite
of applications, to a suitable bidder by the end of January
1996, to coincide with the completion of the company's first
fiscal quarter.

Rapid consolidation in 1995 was characterized by a multitude
of acquisitions, notably IBM's hostile takeover bid for Lotus
in June. That same month, Quarterdeck acquired Landmark Research,
and Symantec agreed to buy Delrina in July.

In May, Microsoft terminated its plans to acquire personal-
finance software publisher Intuit, due to ongoing government
investigations that were distracting company principals. Microsoft
Money, the publisher's entry in the personal finance category,
and Intuit's Quicken were again positioned as competitive titles.
The Redmond publisher had intended to sell its laggard personal
finance title to Novell pending the merger; instead, it continued
development on the product, and released Money 4.0 under the
Microsoft Home brand in the fall.

In June, Netscape Communications shrinkwrapped its popular Netscape
Navigator Web browser for off-the-shelf retail sales. The software
was still available free for downloading from the company's
Web site. Netscape Navigator Personal Edition carried a suggested
retail price of $39.95 and offered customers printed documentation,
Eudora e-mail and technical support.

Microsoft discussed a MAP program for the Windows 95 upgrade
SKU in June. The SRP would be $89.95, and the MAP policy would
run through December. The publisher expected between 20,000
to 30,000 retailers and resellers to carry Windows 95, about
a 35 percent increase since the launch of Windows 3.1.

The start of summer had consumer software publishers SoftKey
International and Expert Software each announcing intentions
to offer children's lines of value-priced titles.

At the same time, Apple continued to consolidate its software
divisions, a plan that had begun in April. The company integrated
all software divisions, including AppleSoft, under the jurisdiction
of Apple subsidiary Claris. Guerina Delucca, former head of
the AppleSoft division, was appointed president of Claris in
May.

When Microsoft finally shipped the Windows 95 operating system
on Aug. 24-more than a year after the product's planned ship
date-the launch exceeded the industry's expectations. A decline
in productivity software sales, which had started in late 1994
and continued through August 1995, ceased as publishers started
to release native Windows 95 titles and traffic flooded stores.
However, Microsoft's MAP policy did not maintain adequate margin
for retailers, who had to depend on attach-rate product sales
to recoup software dollars.

Within four days of the Windows 95 launch, Microsoft had sold
1 million units, according to company officials. At retail,
the first week of sales posted $108 million. By the fourth
week, sales had leveled off to $33 million, according to PC
Data research.

And while Microsoft told analysts at its quarterly earnings
conference that the company had sold 7 million units of Windows
95 through OEM and reseller channels in the first five weeks,
several retail buyers were telling suppliers that excess Windows
95 inventory was impinging on open-to-buy dollars. Microsoft
acknowledged a level of unsold inventory at retail, but said
the levels were manageable.

In November, SoftKey Inernational continued its series of acquisitions
by announcing a hostile bid for educational software publisher
The Learning Company, which had accepted a merger proposal
by Broderbund in July, and a bid for Minnesota Educational
Computing Corp. (MECC). SoftKey's next move was to acquire
reference software publisher Compton's NewMedia from the Tribune
Co.

By the start of the holiday selling season, the number of software
SKUs at retail had increased to 13,569 from 10,997 in 1994,
and the Windows 95 platform was significantly impacting retail
software sales. It represented 15 percent of software units
sold and 20 percent of software dollars during October, according
to PC Data.

Business SKUs still dominate



RESTON, VA.-Despite widespread reports that business productivity
software is rapidly losing shelf space to entertainment and
education titles, market researcher PC Data's year-to-date
SKU count in October indicated the category remains dominant
at retail.

Retailers carried 5,549 business software SKUs during the first
10 months of 1995, up from 4,855 in the year-earlier period.
Personal productivity SKUs increased by about 500 to 1,800
from 1,358 in 1994.

The combined number of education and entertainment SKUs closely
matched the business software SKU count. Retailers carried
2,286 education SKUs, an increase from 1,672 in 1994, and 3,283
game SKUs, compared to 2,502 in 1994.

Controversy surrounds concept of $500 device -- PC Vendors Divided
Over Form, Market For Prototype

By:
GREGORY QUICK

SAN MATEO, CALIF.-Heightened discussion about a $500 computing
device has not died down in the aftermath of Comdex/Fall, as
manufacturers jockey for position in a market which, thus far,
doesn't exist.

While many now agree that some sort of device in the price range
will be introduced in early 1996, the features, functionality
and marketplace-and need for the device-are still up in the
air.

At last month's PC Outlook Conference here, the $500 PC was
one of the hot topics of discussion. One panel was dedicated
exclusively to the topic, but the subject kept cropping up
throughout presentations.

The confusion it has created was evident in the contradictory
remarks that came from both supporters and detractors of the
product-sometimes even from within the same company.

Battling back from one side was Apple Computer and Oracle. While
executives from both companies agreed in concept on the $500
device, they were miles apart on specifically what it will
be.

Apple demonstrated its Pippin device, which was launched last
month in Japan. It will hit volume shipments by midyear and
eventually reach the U.S. market, said Michael Spindler, Apple's
president and chief executive.

While Pippin was originally positioned as a game machine, Spindler
demonstrated its ability to access the Internet and its expandability.

He said that it was a mistake to characterize these machines
as "crippled PCs." Instead, he said, they should be thought
of as products with microprocessors aimed at a different market.

Spindler cited a much-used industry figure that only 30 percent
of U.S. homes have PCs. There may be a percentage of those
which do not have a PC and may want a device that allows them
to simply view information, much like they use the TV for now,
he said.

Spindler admitted there was not yet the bandwidth for the expanded
capability companies now associate with such machines, including
interactive games with which millions could conceivably play
at once.

Satjiv Chahil, Apple's vice president and general manager of
new media and entertainment, said the PC marketplace should
not be satisfied with only 30 percent penetration into the
home market. Studies have shown that the huge bulk of home
users are upper- income families, suggesting a broader mass
market is not being reached.

He said that a sector of the market is not "price adverse,"
but rather technology adverse, so that interactive devices
have to be as easy to use as a CD-ROM player.

Oracle, the company that provided fuel to fan the interest of
this market, repeated company chairman Larry Ellison's comments
that not only was it possible to have devices at $500, but
that they would be available in the first quarter of 1996.

The company said that in every other market there is a range
of offerings at different price points, but claimed the PC
market maintains prices that are artificially held at a certain
level.

An Oracle spokesman said a $500 PC is "not an affront to the
PC industry, but an adjunct to it. There is no magic that takes
a $2,500 PC and makes it into a $500 PC.''

However, while Apple and other backers see such units as multifunctional
devices with expansion capabilities, Oracle's course is defined
by a much more limited device incapable of using other media.

Carl Yankowski, Sony Electronics' president and chief operating
officer, opened his comments by noting Sony's pending entry
into the PC marketplace "is not the $500 PC."

He cautioned "not to be swept up in this nonsense," and added
that the $500 PC is not the key to expanding the consumer market.
But he also agreed that there would be a market for such devices.

One of the most active in casting doubt about the viability
of and need for a $500 device was Intel's Avram Miller, vice
president of corporate business development.

"This is like the RISC/CISC debates. It has become polarized,
and the real issues such as ease of use have become overshadowed,"
Miller said.

There have been many attempts at the low end of the personal
computer market that have failed. Among them are pen computing
and PDAs, said Miller.

"Why should a $500 device be easier to use than a PC? I don't
see it," he said, adding, "A lot of things are happening right
now, but they are happening on the PC."

Craig Barrett, Intel's chief operating officer and executive
vice president, echoed Miller's remarks when he said the $1,000
PC has been around, but has not sold well. Users want a host
of interactive capabilities, including the ability to create,
he said.

Barrett said Intel is, "seeing surprisingly strong sales in
the high-dollar-priced personal computers. The $2,000 PC is
the best Internet terminal you can find." He dismissed the
issue as simply a push by the network operating system companies
battling Microsoft.

Supporting the Intel position was Compaq. Robert Stearns, vice
president of technology and corporate development, noted flatly
that "the $500 price point is impossible to refute because
no one has defined it." He doubted that people would give up
their PCs for a device he believed would be extremely slow.

Stearns cited potential problems in getting a device in under
$500, such as difficulty running PC fonts on a television,
the lack of applications or applets, the need for a keyboard
and the need for lots of RAM as well as its high cost.

While the trend is toward increased ease of use, users also
want features. And to get below a set price point, you have
to throw away features, he said.

However, Stearns' boss, Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq's president
and chief executive, said that "this is the most interesting
direction we will be seeing in the next two years. We see clearly
the paradigm shift" toward the $500 PC.

Pfeiffer acknowledged that a solution of this type could open
the Internet to a much larger population.

"Price elasticity is important to consumers" who want to avoid
costly systems and equipment, he said.

Street Beat: MAP PRICES DO NOT REFLECT TRUE STREET PRICES

By:
Steve Koenig

MAP pricing policies can do much to control the advertised price
points for printers, but MAP prices do not dictate street prices.
In most cases, street prices for printers with MAPs are lower
than the established MAP price. This is not to suggest that
MAP prices do not work. MAP pricing policies work quite well
and are generally responsible for restoring channel margins
for retailers. Hewlett-Packard, Okidata, Epson and Canon have
all gone to MAP pricing recently.

On average, retail street prices on MAP-priced printers are
about 2 percent to 5 percent below the actual MAP price. However,
actual price variations may be much greater than this. For
example, in Dallas the street price of the HP LaserJet 5L recently
dropped to $433 when a price war broke out among retailers
(MAP price on the LaserJet 5L was $479)

Although the MAP price sets a floor for print advertisements,
the MAP price does not restrict what a retailer can sell the
printer for. This also holds true for in-store advertising.
In the case of the HP LaserJet 5L, Micro Center, Dallas, had
an in-store price of $433 on the LaserJet 5L. But the retailer's
print advertisement for the product did not include any price.

Most retailers are generally pleased with MAP pricing because
of the impact on margins. For example, HP sets MAP prices so
that channel margins range from 10 percent to 13 percent depending
on product. Even though actual street prices are a few points
below this range, channel margins are substantially higher
than before implementation of MAP pricing, particularly on
HP's retail printers where margins typically ranged from 0
percent to 4 percent.

Since ARS collects mostly in-store pricing for the Retail Price
Margin Model, the average street prices reflect the true street
price of the products and not the MAP price. Listed above are
the average retail street prices versus the MAP prices for
various printers.

Year In Review '95 -- Communications, low-cost chips were key

By:
GREGORY QUICK

The year 1995 started off with talk on the street focusing on
Intel's recall of Pentium processors, but by the holiday season
12 months later, the hardware market was buzzing about $500
PCs.

Meanwhile, the PC segment of the consumer market took on the
aspect of a revolving door: As Sony announced plans to enter
the market, AT&T exited; and HP entered the market just as
Leading Edge was pulling out.

Desktop computers were still the king of the hill in terms of
PC sales in the retail channel, but the systems users bought
changed over the year.

Several players tried to steal market share from the dedicated
console game machines. IBM and NECT both released systems with
powerful processors aimed directly at the gaming markets.

MPEG compression started to emerge as a standard feature on
desktop systems, both as an integrated hardware and as a software
solution built into the systems.

Apple moved its Power Macintosh technology to retail and jumped
on the PCI bus, allowing add-in card developers to create product
for both platforms.

The chips that powered the systems moved very rapidly last year.
The price point for Pentiums fell faster than expected in October,
a surprising event since Intel's leading competitors were falling
further behind in the industry race.

NexGen and Advanced Micro Devices were forced to merge to stay
competitive; and Cyrix is going direct early this year, although
its high-end Pentium rival 6x86 is currently available.

However, over the course of the year, several of the major players
used processors from both AMD and Cyrix. Among those who took
the plunge were Compaq, Canon, Hewlett-Packard, AST and Epson.

The action was in the Pentium-class processor, with Intel having
phased out most of its production of 486 processors by mid
year. Despite a much-publicized flaw in an earlier version
of the chip, its popularity grew tremendously as the year progressed.

Pentium portables also made a big splash late in the year. Intel
expects the Pentium adoption in the portable market to be faster
than in the desktop arena.

Portables started to gain solid sales in the retail channel
as well as users with one system at home opt for portability
in their second system.

With portables increasing sales share, vendors were focusing
more on providing add-on solutions for them, primarily in the
PCMCIA card market.

PCMCIA cards not only gained attention last year but a new name
as well-now simply PC cards. Besides a variety of storage solutions
that encompass hard-drive, DRAM, SRAM, Flash and wireless solutions,
PC cards are winning popularity as fax modems, LAN adapters
and an increasing host of other functions.

Users have the capabilities now to use a wireless connection
to a LAN in an office to stay in touch with e-mail.

The need to stay in touch, with e-mail, the Internet or an online
bulletin board, helped keep modem sales strong. The technology
rapidly advanced from 14.4K bps to 28.8K bps, and cable modems
capable of moving even faster are on the horizon.

As the year ended, DSVD modems, which can send voice and data
simultaneously, were also rapidly gaining popularity.

ISDN modems, which provide even greater speeds desired by hard
core Internet surfers, are also poised to explode in the next
year, if modem manufacturers have their way.

The year 1995 also ushered in the start of changes in the 3.5
inch floppy drives, a standard on PCs for most of this decade.
Several major Japanese companies started looking at Iomega's
Zip drives, which store as much as 100M bytes in a 3.5-inch
magneto optical format. Power Computing and Micron Electronics
both started including it in systems.

However, Iomega was not alone in the removable mass storage
market. SyQuest introduced rival technology called the SQ3270,
which is also vying for share of mind and market.

Windows 95 helped drive demand for hard-drive upgrades as well
as the sale of DRAM as users upgraded systems to handle the
new operating system.

The market for multimedia upgrades continued to swell. Despite
premature reports of the market's death, the companies involved
have continually upgraded product to provide customers with
offerings not available from PC manufacturers.

Such items as 6x and 8x CD-ROM drives, 3-D stereo, 28.8K-bps
modems and now ISDN offerings first hit as upgrades long before
the rest of the industry caught up.

The market for handheld devices saw some advances last year
but still has not expanded the way analysts and other industry
observers predicted it would several years ago. However, many
of the players in the market did enhance their product offerings.
Last year saw new systems or upgrades of existing ones from
Hewlett-Packard, with its OmniGo 100, Apple's Newton 2.0 specification
and the second-generation MagicLink from Sony.

The peripherals market, meanwhile, has seen rapid technology
transition.

Digital cameras started to reach the price points and feature
sets that made them click with retail consumers. With this
decline in prices has come an increase in competition. Some
long-time players such as Apple have upgraded existing products
and lowered prices in the face of competition from newcomers
such as Epson, Fuji, Ricoh and Minolta.

While CD-ROM drives are spinning faster, they are also holding
more discs, an important feature with the advent of multi-disc
programs and games. Pricing on four-disc changers at the end
of the year roughly paralleled the delta between single-speed
and quad-speed drives when the latter were launched. Many manufacturers
expect these changers to become a standard feature in desktop
systems by mid-1996.

As the speed and capabilities of CD-ROMs have increased, a new
technology saw standardization late last year, and is expected
to challenge the CD-ROM in several markets. Digital Video Disc
(DVD) has become the accepted standard among the giant consumer
electronics and media companies, which were originally headed
in separate directions. The discs, which will have capacities
as large as 14G bytes, should be on shelves by next fall.

Multifunction devices, which combine scanning, printing and
faxing functions, started to gain steam with players like Panasonic,
Hewlett-Packard, Canon and others entering the market. They
still face tough merchandising and consumer-awareness issues,
however.

Computer monitors last year saw an evolution into truly multimedia
stations, as vendors began endowing them with speakers and
microphones, as well as headphone jacks and other functions.

The dedicated game machine market is in the midst of yet another
transition, this time to 64-bit technology. Nintendo of America
previewed its next-generation game machine, the Ultra 64, which
was jointly developed by Nintendo and Silicon Graphics; it
is expected to have a $250 street price.

But the game-system competition was fierce last year: Sega shipped
its Saturn three moths early in select markets while Sony hit
the ground running with its PlayStation, which saw strong sales
in the weeks after its introduction.

The talk at the end of the year was the feasibility of the $500
PC, and whether such a product would truly suit the business
or home markets. Would the machine be a dedicated Internet
cruiser or an expandable system also capable of running spreadsheets
and games?

While the talk was fast and furious from such leaders such as
Apple, Intel, Compaq and Oracle, no company thus far has taken
the concept beyond the discussion stage.

Advanced Gravis ships pair of game controllers

By:
GERGORY QUICK

BURNABY, BRITISH COLUMBIA-Advanced Gravis Computer Technology
has expanded its game controller offerings with a pair of new
products, one destined for the Macintosh market and the other
for Windows users.

The Mac Firebird Programmable Flight and Game Controller for
Macintosh is an advanced controller designed for use with sophisticated
games.

The Mac Firebird has a total of 21 buttons including an eight
directional hat switch that can be adjusted by the user. The
buttons can be used in a variety of ways, including traditional
joy stick mode or to activate single keystroke commands. Buttons
can also be custom programmed.

In addition, the controller has a programmable throttle lever
and a elevator trim control for flight games and comes with
an input slot that supports most popular PC rudder pedals.

The Mac Firebird is compatible with mouse-, keyboard- and joystick
controlled games, and automatically downloads most game settings.

Once a custom setting has been finalized, it can then be printed
out to be used as a reference card when that program is used
again.

The software that comes packaged with the Mac Firebird includes
80 predefined settings for use with most popular games. The
software also allows a user to cut and paste features from
one game program to another. It also allows for individual
features to be drag-and-dropped between different program control
sets, said Grant Russell, Advanced Gravis' chief technology
officer.

Despite the fact that Windows users far outnumber Macintosh
users, Advanced Gravis has seen strong sales for its controllers
in the Mac marketplace.

"The Macintosh has a high penetration into the home. And while
such systems may have been purchased for education purposes,
entertainment quickly becomes one of its primary uses," said
Russell. "We are seeing a lot of game developers writing software
that takes advantage of our controller. We should start seeing
many of those applications very soon."

Still, he acknowledged that since the Macintosh market is significantly
smaller than the Windows market, shelf space is much more limited,
especially in smaller stores. But the company also recently
added Wal-Mart to its retail lineup.

The controller is currently shipping and has a $89.95 retail
price.

For the Windows market the company has an entry-level controller
that does not include the advanced programmable features of
the Mac Firebird.

The Gravis Thunderbird Flight & Game Controller has a four-way
directional hat switch and the same elevator and throttle controls
and four quick-response buttons.

The Gravis Thunderbird is currently shipping and has a $49.95
list price.

Off The Shelf



"The worst December in 30 years," was how one seasoned merchant
described sales in the waning days of 1995.

Harsh weather, maxed-out credit cards and high prices seem to
have collided to keep consumers out of stores, or at least
away from cash registers. And while we are certain there are
chains out there that'll say they've defied the odds, word
of several companies looking at negative comp-store sales the
weekend before Christmas doesn't bode well.

But what's on retailers' minds now is January. Compaq, among
others, is dropping prices to make way for an aggressive, early
shipping product line. Will there be room in the channel for
all these new lines, sporting yet a new round of processors,
if there are stockpiles of the old lines?

Compaq, which is making the most of its CES attendance since
it doesn't attend Comdex, has a host of technology announcements
planned for the show. One item that won't be given the highest
profile is the company's rumored decision to switch to a one
year return-to-depot warranty across its desktop line.

While the spoken logic is that Compaq is appeasing retailers
such as CompUSA who want to sell third-party extended warranties,
the cost savings to Compaq must look phenomenal on paper. Expect
other top-tier vendors to give serious consideration to their
three-year warranty programs.

Packard Bell's decision to rethink its former rejection of minimum
advertised pricing has other makers reconsidering the same.
Packard Bell has flown select retailers to its Sacramento compound
during the past month to talk product and to discuss the prospect
of MAPs on certain sell-through models. Sources said Acer America
also informed key retailers it is considering doing the same
on select models early next year. If it's true, it could reflect
an acceptance of MAPs not only by the vendors, but by retailers
that in the past have strongly objected to MAPs. Best Buy would
be among the more notable of these.

Speaking of Best Buy, word on the street is that the retailer
took Wall Street's advice to trim back its expansion plans
this year. One financial whiz close to the company said to
expect 15 to 20 new Best Buys this year, down from 35 to 40.
In the same boat, apparently, is Incredible Universe, said
to have reduced its planned new stores this year to six from
a former 10; and Computer City, which is now expected to open
20 rather than 30 units in 1996.

While new stores drop, watch prices of color inkjet printers
drop as well. Sources said Lexmark will break ground with the
industry's first $199 color inkjet when it reduces prices on
its model CJ1020C on Jan. 4.

On the personnel front, Fred Brown, the former AT&T retail vice
president, recently took up with MetaTools, the Santa Barbara,
Calif., software company formerly known as HSC Software. Brown
is said to be enjoying a generous AT&T severance package, plenty
of MetaTool stock options and a 10-minute commute to his Santa
Barbara home.

Merchandising: Shelf Life

By:
Max Wurz

Integrated marketing has been a popular concept with marketing
professionals for a long time. However, this has mostly been
the domain of lofty brand-development and advertising types.
With increasing retail competition, it's time to take a new
look at integrated marketing.

It's simple. If retail is at the core of a product's life, retail
should be at the core of a product's integrated marketing.
Sure, the notion remains the same: Put all your eggs in one
focused, highly orchestrated marketing basket. The implementation
is quite different, though.

In the previous version, integrated marketing meant developing
product positioning and slick communications that applied neatly
to consumer advertising. Then, you'd move into "secondary"
efforts such as packaging, channel advertising, retail merchandising
and sales promotion. The primary objective here is building
brand awareness.

My new version, appropriately dubbed Integrated Retail Marketing,
flips this by first asking the question, "What will work best
at retail?" The primary focus here is on building retail sales,
and the critical components are:

Retail packaging. Nothing matters more. Marketing programs come
and go, but your product packaging lives on. Don't skimp.

Public relations. If I only had a dime left after my killer
retail packaging was developed, I would insert it into the
P.R. machine. Look for plugged-in tacticians who can put you
in all the right places.

Promotion and merchandising. Few things turn the sales crank
like retail sales promotion and merchandising. Unlike almost
all other marketing efforts, this combination pulls together
the resources of both sales and marketing to drive stocking
levels, merchandising positions and retailer promotion.

Consumer advertising and direct mail. Do it, but only if you
can afford to do it right. Always integrate it into retail
promotions and merchandising campaigns. And never do it just
because the competition does it.

Interactive marketing. The Web can be a powerful marketing tool.
But don't just settle for a pretty site with product information;
go for the gusto with promotions that will help close the sale.

Bottom line? Integrated marketing works best. Just don't forget
where your sales are.
