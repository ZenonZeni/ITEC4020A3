Gone is <i>Mackenzie Financial</i>, in favour of a multi-manager approach involving <i>Mawer Investment Management, McLean Budden and</i> <i>O'Donnell Management. Templeton</i> is retained as international managers.<p><i>Mackenzie</i> will have a new role, offering their funds to CMA members as part of a new RRSP program.<p><i>Canada Trust</i> is also changing managers. <i>Mulvihill Investment Management</i> will step down from <i>CT'</i>s funds in favour of a new in-house management group. John Mulvihill was formerly head of <i>CT'</i>s investment management subsidiary. <i>CT</i> says that a recent internal investment management re-organization made outside investment management services redundant.<p><i>Trimark Investment Management</i>, Canada's second largest fund manager, is launching the <i>Discovery Fund</i>. The fund will capitalize on  international "idea driven, knowledge-based companies" in the technology, telecommunications, biotechnology and applied science fields. Trimark Discovery fund is aimed at long term investors, who are seeking aggressive growth. <i>Trimark</i> will use their normal bottom-up fundamental investment analysis approach and expect to stay fully invested. <i>Trimark</i> expect to shorten their investment holding period down to two to three years. <i>Trimark</i> funds' holding period is normally four years, differing considerably from many aggressive funds, whose investment holding period can sometimes be measured in months.<p><i>Investors Group, </i>Canada's largest fund company, will add eleven new funds to their lineup. Under the <i>Investors'</i> name, five funds will be offered, including: a small cap. Canadian; a natural resources fund; a U.S. fund with a higher small/mid cap. concentration, a high-yield bond fund and a Latin fund. Outside managers Sceptre Mutual Funds will offer three funds and Buetel Goodman will also offer three funds. These new funds will be in addition to 30 funds that Investors already offers to Canadians.<p><i>Scudder Canada </i>will now offer their no-load funds through Royal Bank's Action Direct discount brokerage service. Scudder Canada, an affiliate of giant US fund managers Scudder Stephens and Clark, have changed distribution strategy and plan to look for other discount brokerage affiliations. The Scudder funds will still be offered on a no-load basis, but discount brokers will probably charge a small redemption fee upon redemption.<p><i>TD Bank </i>launches ACCESS. The TD Bank will now offer  a full package of banking and brokerage services 24 hours per day. Amongst many other services, ACCESS permits 24 hour access to TD Greenline, permitting the sale of North American stocks, options and about 500 Canadian mutual funds.<p>Spectrum United Mutual Funds will shortly ask shareholders to approve an integration between Spectrum, Bullock and United funds. Spectrum, who already own United and Bullock, is planning to streamline their fund offerings by amalgamating five funds and further expect to benefit from other economies of scale. Spectrum now has $4.5 Billion under management and is a subsidiary of Sun Life. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>There are no<br>charts related<br>to this article.</font><p></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="bonds.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="books.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font></center></body></html>
