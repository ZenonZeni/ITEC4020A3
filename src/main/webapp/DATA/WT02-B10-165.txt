Drs. Spitzer and Williams continue their work with a group of primary care physicians in the refinement of PRIME-MD (Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders), a new procedure for diagnosing mental disorders in the primary care setting. During the past year, over four thousand primary care physicians have been trained in administering PRIME-MD.

Utilizing the database from the PRIME-MD 1000 Study, Drs. Spitzer and Williams and their colleagues have investigated patterns of impairment in the domains of health-related quality of life (social, role and occupational functioning, mental health, bodily pain, and general health) to determine if different mental disorders have different patterns of impairment and how these patterns compare with those associated with general medical disorders. The results indicate that the most common types of disorders (mood, anxiety, alcohol, eating, and somatoform disorders) have distinctive patterns. Furthermore, the impairment associated with these mental disorders is far greater, in general, than that associated with common types of medical disorders.

DSM-IV, the most recent edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, was published in May 1994. Several members of the department played major roles in its preparation. Dr. First served as Editor of Text and Criteria for DSM-IV, Dr. Spitzer was special advisor to the DSM-IV Task Force, and Dr. Williams was Chair of the Multiaxial Work Group. Dr. First has given numerous extensive workshops on using the new DSM-IV at a number of Office of Mental Health (OMH) facilities. In addition, a five-hour videotaped presentation by Dr. First has been distributed to all OMH facilities for the purpose of staff training. Dr. First is also serving as Editor of the <BR>
DSM-IV-PC, a version of the DSM-IV for primary care clinicians.

One of the most important products of the Biometrics Research department is the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID). The SCID is a diagnostic instrument that is widely used by researchers and clinicians in order to guide the diagnostic evaluation process. The introduction of the DSM-IV has necessitated a major revision of the SCID in order to update it for the new classification. This new version of the SCID also provides several new features to increase the instrument's usefulness. Drafts of the revised SCID were field tested at a number of research sites in order to elicit feedback. A final version of the SCID was made available at the end of the year.

Dr. Williams has continued to collaborate in the analysis of data from the Psychosocial/Qualitative Assessment Core of the HIV Center. She and her colleagues have examined psychopathology in male and female intravenous drug users with and without HIV infection. They are currently exploring the relationship of personality pathology to the development of Axis I symptoms and disorders. Dr. Williams has also participated in the development of DSM-IV-PC as a member of the DSM-IV Primary Care Work Group. A major role of hers this year has been as Founding President of the Society for Social Work and Research, already 275 members-strong. She founded the organization to help build an infrastructure of supports and linkages for social workers who are interested in research. Dr. Williams is in charge of planning the first national social work research conference, which will be held in Washington, DC in April 1995.
