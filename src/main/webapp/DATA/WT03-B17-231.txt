Dear Andy,

I  find that no matter what I do, I can't get these ants  to
behave!  I  have tried everything including  what's  in  your
book. Now please help me.
Yours
Lost

Dear  Lost,

Whenever Ants are behaving like there's no tomorrow, you  can
be sure there's a reason for it! You must realize that ants react
to  everything  that  happens to their environment.  The  more
chemicals are  being used  in  our  environment,  the
greater the reaction from the ants. Look around you,
see  if  you  can  find a local source  of  chemicals.  From
chemical  fertilizers  to chemical herbicides,  etc..  Remove
them  and  you  will begin to get  greater control  over  the
ants!
Take slow  steps  to change. This is the  best  way.  Don't
expect  too much too fast. Learn to use the natural soaps  I
mention in my book. Using these natural soaps will go a long
way toward controlling ants. Ants do not like soap and they will
behave if they know you will use it against them!
Use  the  soap inside. Clean up after yourself! Don't  leave
food around for them or they'll come and get it!
Attend to the health of the soil first! Then everything else
will fall into place!
<HR>
Please  feel free to send me your questions and I will  post
them up with an answer.

<HR>
Dear Andy,
  I  followed the steps in your book and I still have ants! What  am  I
doing  wrong? It has been several weeks now. Please tell me what  I  am
doing  wrong and what I should do to correct it? I am recently  married
and do not wish to use any chemicals around my wife and animals.

  New Husband In need,

  Dear Husband in need,
  It  is understandable that you are in a hurry to get some relief from
the  ant  problem.  It  is important that you follow  the  instructions
actually as written. In order to work, these steps must be  given
enough  time  for  the process to begin to take hold.  Two  things  are
happening, 1... you are learning, and 2... so are the ants!  As  you  learn
to  respond to the ants, you will also be conditioning the ants.  Learn
to  use  the soaps as your first line of defense. There are many natural
soaps  out  there!  I personally like Dr. Bronners Peppermint  soap  for
this purpose.  Follow the instructions as per strength to mix with water
in  quart  sprayer. Another thing is, in order for you to control the  ants,
the  ant cafe must work. In other words, the ant cafe must be actively
being  used by theants! Feed them as per instructions. Feed  them  only
sugared water at first then boric acid once they are active in the  ant
cafes. See Boric acid Faq for help in using .

<HR>
  Dear Andy,
  How long will I have to feed them? I can't feed them for the rest of
my life, can I?

 Rest of life...

  Dear Rest of Life.
  Doing  something  for the rest of one's life does sound  like  a  long
time  and  it may well be, but moment to moment, it is not.  What
you  do now effects you now. The longer you do it, the longer it  will
continue to affect you. So as for how long will you have to `feed'  the
ants? Well you will do it for as you as you have to and for as long  as
it works and for as long as it makes you happy to do so.  I  find that
 where I live that conditions are such that I have greatly reduced
ant  problems simply by feeding the ants in the ant cafes and using
the  peppermint inside.

<HR>
Dear Andy,

My question is, if I don't use any boric  acid,
and  just  feed them , won't their colony get bigger and won't  it  get
worse? Hmmm?

Dear Hmmm?,
There  will  come a point when there will just be too  many  ants  on
your  property for you to live happily with.  It's that simple. You  feed
the  ants and condition them to stay out of the house and certain other
places you don't want them to get into, in exchange  for  which  you
feed  them! But once the ants think that you are their slave  and
they  want more you will have to get their attention! You already  have
their attention indoors by using the peppermint soap, now you get their
attention outside by introducing boric acid to their food. I know  it's
mean  and cruel but it's the best way to go instead of using chemicals  that
slowly torture them to death. See how to use boric acid.
But  concerning  your  question about the ants getting  too  big  and
going  after  us well mother nature will not allow any one creature  to
rule. Watch and see.

Dear Andy,

How  much soap is enough to add to 1 quart of water? I added
the amount in the book to kill the roaches but found that  I
had to make it stonger to make it work.  I thought perhaps  I
was making it too stong? Soapy

Dear Soapy,

The  strength of the soap will vary from state to state and
from  species to species of ants. Generally I  would  try  1
tablespoon   of  any  concentrated  soap  like  Dr   Bronners
peppermint soap to a quart water.  Spray on ants and  see  if
it  is  stong  enough  to  kill them.  If  not, add  another
tablespoon.  Do this until you have reached a point where the
ants die on contact with the soap-water mixture.
<HR>
Dear Andy,
I  am finding it hard to find Dr. Bronners peppermint soap
around where I live. Can I use something else? Hard to Find


Dear Hard to find,

Any Natural  soap  will  do.  Just remember  that  peppermint
works especially  well for this purpose but citrus or  herbal
soaps  work  also.  Just read the label and avoid  anything
with additives, etc. in it!

>Dear  Nancy,  your mistaken about me not having all the answers,  what
you  read  was only a small step in the right direction.  I  have  over
6,000  members that will tell you that I have helped them control their
ant  problems,  I  have  written 8 books, my  latest  is  Natural  Pest
Control. If you have doubts about my ant stuff why would you want  more
incorrect stuff about termites(which you must not have read on  my  web
site)? I have a chapter on natural termite control also.
Book is $19.95
not interested in your mountain grocery stuff( I probably allready have
it anyway).

P.S.  While I know That I don't have all the answers, I triy my best to
provide  you with solutions that work. To do this I try them out  first
in my natural pest control business as well as with my classes.

To insult me then to try to get free stuff from me is not a good way to
do business.
If you wish to find out directly from Nancy here what she has to offer,
please email her. As a club member you are allowed to trade my info for
other info. Do you at your own risk!
