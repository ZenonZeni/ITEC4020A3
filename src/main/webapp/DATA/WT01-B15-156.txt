<B>Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) Photo/Mapping Gantry.</B><P>
This photo is a view of the TBM taken from the photo/mapping gantry and may look much like some you have seen before, but it shows the machine leaving the main drift and entering the turn into the ramp to the south portal where it will exit the mountain.  This progress signifies a shift in emphasis from excavating the main drift to conducting scientific experiments in the tunnel and in the alcoves.

<B>Testing in the Thermomechanical Alcove</B><P> 
Here is a view of the heater test array in the Thermomechanical Alcove.  The single heater test, which began on August 26th, will give us information on thermal effects and experience with the instruments prior to our larger, multi-element drift scale heater tests.  In the center of this picture you can see the hole where the heater element has been emplaced.  You can also see the array of instruments that will measure the effect of heat on the rock and effect of heat on moisture within the rock.

<B>Installation of Heater Assembly</B><P>
This is a photo of the heater element being emplaced in the borehole that is surrounded by the instrument array.  The heater is 5 meters long, will output about 4 kW and will heat the rock in the vicinty of the heater to about 300&#176; C.

<B>Escavation of North Ghost Dance Fault Alcove</B><P>
This photo shows the construction of the Northern Ghost Dance Fault Alcove.  Excavation has been completed to the planned length of 90 meters.  Because we are unsure as the location of the fault, we will drill a discovery borehole into the face of the alcove to locate the fault.  If we do not find the fault, the alcove will be further excavated, and another discovery borehole will be drilled.  Once the fault is located, we will drill a number of boreholes through the fault to test the relatively undisturbed physical and hydrologic characteristics of the fault.  Then, we will excavate the alcove through the fault zone to provide for direct observation and testing.

<B>Moisture Measurements in Thermomechanical Alcove</B> <P>
Here you see a technician measuring moisture in the Thermomechanical Alcove.  We are obtaining data on the level of water content in the rock prior to the heater tests.  These tests will also provide an opportunity to test the instruments before the larger and more complex drift scale tests are conducted.

<B>Rock Stability Measurements Near the Thermomechanical Alcove</B>.<P>
This photo shows two technicians measuring the dimensions of the opening near the entrance to the Thermomechanical Testing Alcove to check mechanical stability.  The thermal effects on rock stability are important to design and repository operations.
