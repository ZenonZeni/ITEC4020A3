Toshiba:Established A China Joint Venture to Manufacture

from MAINICHI PRESS RELEASE SERVICE/ENGLISH SERVICE, September 17, 1996

September,1996

TOKYO -- Toshiba Corporation today announced that it has entered into
agreements with Chinese partners and Nichimen Corp. to establish a
joint venture company to manufacture and market color television sets
(CTVs) in Dalian, China.

Investment in the new facility acounts to approximately US$ 98.1
million. The establishment will assure Toshiba of a solid manufacturing
and marketing base for color television sets to address the strong
growth of demand anticipated in China, and to supply other fast-growing
Asian countries.

Dalian Toshiba Television Co., Ltd. (DTV), the color TV plant, will
have an initial capitalization of US$49.1 million, 52 percent owned by
Toshiba Corp., 13percent by Toshiba (China) Co., Ltd., 5 percent by
Nichimen Corp. and 30 percent by Dalian Daxian Group Corp. The
procedures to establish the IV were completed in last July. DTV's
facilities, including a product design and development center, will be
located on a plot next to Toshiba's Dalian facility for manufacturing
electronic components, Toshiba Dalian Co., Ltd. (TDL).

Construction will start in October 1996 and manufacturing is scheduled
to begin in October I 997. The plant will have a production capacity of
1 million units a year, and a product line-up of 21-inch to 29-inch
CTV. Output will be sold in China and also exported, malnly to other
Asian countries.

Market Gro'wth Expected
The worldwide CTV market reached 109.6 million units last year, and is
expected to enjoy steady growth to 112 million units this year.
Particularly strong growth is expected in the Chinese market, with high
growth rates pushing demand to 15 million units in 1995 and 20 million
in 2000. It is expected to match the U.S. marketinsize by 2000.

Toshiba's Facilities Worldwide
Toshiba is establishing a global network of CTV manufacturhig and
marketing facilities based in key markets including Japan, North and
Latin America, Europe and Asia. In fiscal year 1995, the company's
facilities worldwide sold approximately 6.1 million units.

Toshiba is establishing the new facility in Dalian: (1) to assure a
manufacturing and marketing operation supporting production of products
to meet demand from the Chinese market; (2) and because TDL already
produces key CTV components in Dalian, including TV chassis and tuners,
which provides a basis to create mutual effect for Toshiba Group by
extending overall manufacturing operation and procurement in the region.

Toshiba develops and produces a wide range of products in order to meet
diverse demands in different markets. The company is currently
enhancing all aspects of its global manufacturing operation structure,
from procurement to assembly, with consideration for such factors as
market size, costs and labor availability, etc. The establishment of
the new company fits into this worldwide strategy, and also allows
Toshiba to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation through business.

Toshiba:Uses the Internet to Strengthen Worldwide

from MAINICHI PRESS RELEASE SERVICE/ENGLISH SERVICE, September 17, 1996

September,1996

Tokyo--Toshiba Corporation today announced that it will use the
Internet to bring a new dimension to its worldwide procurement of
components and materials. The company is listing descriptions and
specifications of items it wants to purchase, and inviting suppliers
to e-mail details of price, availability and other information.

This new approach is part of Toshiba's reinforcement of global
purchasing. The company wants to procure from companies competitive in
price, delivery, quality and service, thus assuring its own
competitiveness across its wide range of business, from semiconductors
to power plant. Procurement from outside Japan amounted to 341.6
billion yen last fiscal year, and is expected to rise to 500 billion
yen by fiscal 1998, ending March 1999.

Use of the Internet will support Toshiba in finding and contacting new
suppliers, procuring from the most competitive sources, establishing
clear, speedy and effective communications, and developing and
maintaining mutually beneficial relations with suppliers.

Commenting on the on-line system, Mr. Hideo Shimizu, General Manager
of the Procurement Division, was very positive: "1 see the Internet as
having a very positive influence on our procurement. It gives us a
powerful means for finding and working closely with potential
suppliers, and 1 think it will also assure fairness, openness and our
accessibility to suppliers."

In other moves to strengthen worldwide procurement, Toshiba is also
enlarging its network of International Procurement Offices. Two new
offices will open this coming October, in Vienna, Austria and Dallas,
Texas, bringing to 11 the number of offices located in strategic
locations around the world.
