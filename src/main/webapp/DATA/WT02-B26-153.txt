Walter Coddington is the president of Coddington Environmental Management
(CEM), the first environmental marketing consultancy in the United States
dedicated to helping businesses, governmental agencies and environmental
organizations develop and promote environmentally responsible policies,
products, technologies and educational programs. Since its formation in
1990, CEM has served the ARM &amp; HAMMER&reg; products company, Weyerhaeuser,
Miller Brewing, Benckiser, General Electric Plastics, Pepsi USA, Seagrams,
Young &amp; Rubicam, United States Department of Agriculture, US Environmental
Protection Agency, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations
Population Fund, The Aspen Institute, National Wildlife Federation, National
Audubon Society and many others. <BR>
<BR>
In 1993, McGraw-Hill, a leading publisher of marketing and environmental
management books, published Walter Coddington's comprehensive textbook Environmental
Marketing. Subtitled Positive Strategies for Reaching the Green Consumer,
the work examines how companies can profit from environmental stewardship.
Many of the strategies recommended can be employed by marketers in any part
of the world, consequently, the book has shown up in classrooms as diverse
as those in Northern California and South Korea.<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, Mr. Coddington co-founded with Mr. Claes Nobel of the Swedish Nobel
Prize family, The Claes Nobel Institute for Environmental Technologies.
The Institute provides emerging environmental technology companies with
financial and global marketing assistance. <BR>
<BR>
Walter Coddington specializes in structuring and managing public/private
partnership programs that stimulate social, environmental and economic development
at a community level. One such program is the En-Graffiti pilot in New York
City's Borough of Queens. En-Graffiti has proved to be the Salvation Army's
most successful job training program helping homeless veterans transition
back into mainstream society. In addition, it has helped the corporate partner,
the ARM &amp; HAMMER baking soda company, open new markets for its environmental
technologies and products.
