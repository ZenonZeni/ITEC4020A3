ith this issue, we mark our First Anniversary, the ending of an incredible 12 months during which SMOKE has grown in every conceivable way at an unprecedented rate.  To our readers, our advertisers, the smoke shops, the staff, the Lockwoods, and last, but not least, my family:  Thank you, one and all.  (Anyone not included in the above list that feels slighted, please insert your name and know that it applies to you too!)
<P>
The Holidays have always been about togetherness and belonging: feelings that we cigar smokers get to feel year-round.  Smoking a cigar with another lover of the leaf will break any awkwardness or lack of understanding; it brings a commonality to the table that allows everyone to relax; and lighting up with a neophyte creates an instantaneous bond that words can not express.  
<P>
We've all heard the stories such as:  you run out of cigars in the middle of nowhere and a total stranger gives you one upon hearing you mention it to the person you're with; or, you're walking down the street, someone comments on what you're smoking and you hand out a stick.  There is a universal truth in the karma of giving out a cigar, I guess because it is a gesture so far beyond what words can convey.  
<P>
A cigar is not just about lighting up a bunch of dried out, rolled up leaves.  It's about moments, relationships; it's about pleasures, it's about life.  I suppose that's

why this sense of belonging prevails year-round.  I feel sorry for those who will 
never experience this and/or want to quash it.  It astonishes me that these anti-smoking, anti-meat eating, anti-alcohol consuming, anti-fornicating, health nazis want to take away the few physical pleasures we have left on this earth.  Where do these people come from?  What do they do for enjoyment?  I wish I had the opportunity to take all of them to a steak dinner, downing a bourbon, and lighting up a stog' -- then let them curse the unity of cigar smokers.  Instead, I think they will come to recognize what the rest of us already know; that cigar smokers, although not an elite group, are a passionate one; we are generous and truly carry that special "togetherness feeling" that others experience only once a year.  But most of all, we have a love and passion for life!  Happy Holidays everyone -- smoke 'em if you got 'em!
