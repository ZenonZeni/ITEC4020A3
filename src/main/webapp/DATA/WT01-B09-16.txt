<BLOCKQUOTE>
 Washington, D.C. — For the first time, railroad locomotives will be subject to air pollution rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, standards that will require emissions cuts of up to two-thirds, reports the Los Angeles Times. A typical locomotive puts out as many tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx) – a chief ingredient of smog – as 2,000 passenger cars; 18,000 locomotives in the U.S. are responsible for 5 percent of the country’s air pollution. Beginning in 2001, railroads must gradually begin reducing emissions. By 2005, emissions must be cut 50 percent for hydrocarbons and particulates; 66 percent for NOx. Engine modifications are expected to raise engine costs by about 4 percent, according to EPA estimates. Because California’s air is the worst, the railroads have agreed to put the new engines – not yet engineered – in service there first.
