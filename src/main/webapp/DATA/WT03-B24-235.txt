WASHINGTON -- Gene therapy has been over-hyped, false expectations of rapid progress have been raised, and NIH should shift its spending in the field to basic research, according to a report submitted to NIH Director Harold Varmus.<p>
The report by an ad hoc committee appointed by Varmus to assess the NIH investment in gene therapy was presented last week at a meeting of the Advisory Committee to the Director.<p>
Another committee presented a report assessing the activities of the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC). <p>
The report on NIH investment concluded that although somatic gene therapy "offers extraordinary potential, in the long-term, for the management and correction of human disease," there have been few if any results achieved to date. <p>
"While the expectations and the promise of gene therapy are great, clinical efficacy has not been definitively demonstrated at this time in any gene therapy protocol, despite anecdotal claims of successful therapy and the initiation of more than 100 Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC)-approved protocols," according to the report. <p>
<b><center>Science lacks maturity</b></center><p>
The lack of results largely stems from the immaturity of the basic science. "Significant problems remain in all basic aspects of gene therapy," the report said. "Major difficulties at the basic level include shortcomings in all current gene transfer vectors and an inadequate understanding of the biological interaction of these vectors with the host."<p>
In addition, the report said, "in the enthusiasm to proceed to clinical trials, basic studies of disease pathophysiology, which are likely to be critical to the eventual success of gene therapy, have not been given adequate attention.<p>
The report criticized the majority of gene protocols, saying they yield little useful data. The "very low frequency of gene transfer, reliance on qualitative rather than quantitative assessments of gene transfer and expression, lack of suitable controls, and lack of rigorously defined biochemical or disease endpoints," has limited the ability to interpret most trials, the ad hoc committee concluded. <p>
The panel members warned that the "overselling" of clinical results, by investigators and their sponsors, threatens to "undermine confidence in the integrity of the field." In their presentation to Varmus, the panel members said exaggerated media reports of impending gene therapy cures have led some people to take dangerous decisions about health care treatment and reproduction. <p>
The panel said it "recommends a concerted effort on the part of scientists, clinicians, science writers, research advocates, research institutions, industry, and the press to inform the public about not only the extraordinary promise of gene therapy, but also its current limitations."<p>
The report also suggests that NIH should not expand its recently funded three central vector production facilities. "Uncertainties regarding which vectors may be best suited for specific clinical studies argue against establishing a large national infrastructure for vector production," said the report. "Furthermore, the relative costs of vector production at the NIH supported sites should be carefully compared with those incurred in producing vectors under contracts to industry."<p>
The panel estimated that NIH spends about $200 million a year on gene therapy research, which it estimated is about equal to that of the private sector in the U.S. <p>
While the report acknowledges industry's role in developing gene therapies, it also warns of potential conflicts of interest between the private sector's pursuit of profit and NIH's mission to promote public health. <p>
"First, industry is skilled in translational research and the development of drug products. Second, it has significant experience in meeting high manufacturing and quality control standards, and maintains a professional staff dedicated to regulatory and clinical issues. Third, a high level of scientific and technical expertise characterizes modern biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies."<p>
On the other hand, the panel warned that "the field is at risk to the extent that the premature initiation of clinical studies and overzealous, uncritical reports of clinical results are used by industry to promote investment and perceived research dominance."<p>
In addition, the report said, "decisions regarding diseases to be treated need to be made by investigators on scientific rather than financial criteria."<p>
The panel also said it is important "that issues of proprietary control not limit the development of clinical protocols." It said that several scientists have complained about "logistical difficulties encountered in gaining industrial approval to perform clinical studies in which cytokines and other reagents were to be obtained from several, often competing companies."<p>
Although it is too early to assess the impact of "the licensing of a broad patent to a single company for ex vivo gene therapy," the committee expressed concern "that broad patents of this kind will ultimately retard implementation of successful gene therapy protocols once they are developed."<p>
<p>
<b><center>RAC evaluation</b></center><p>
The second ad hoc committee's report suggested that the RAC does not have sufficient expertise to pass judgement on the scientific merits of the protocols it receives and should restrict its consideration to safety issues.<p>
The panel concurred with the newly introduced policy under which RAC only reviews protocols that represent a significant departure from those that have been approved in the past. Routine protocol review will be handled by FDA. <p>
The committee's report listed several types of protocols that the RAC should continue to review, including: "the use of novel vectors, particularly in cases in which modified human pathogens (such as herpes viruses or lentiviruses) are being evaluated; gene transfer in utero, potential germ line modification, and other similar manipulations; and gene transfer in normal volunteers."<p>
