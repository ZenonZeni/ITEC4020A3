Trade




Syndrome</B>

</A>











</H1><P>













<P> <B>Trading with China is a lot like eating Chinese food:  It is exciting
and appealing at first, but after indulging you are left hungry and unfulfilled,






















often with a pounding headache.  Yes, of course, China is a big market with
a billion potential consumers. But, getting down to the nitty-gritty, China
does not make anything that we really need.  Trading with China has injured






















America greatly, costing 700,000 well-paying jobs, harming hard-working






















Americans.  And to add insult to this painful injury, China has been kicking
us where it hurts most.  The more we trade with China, the more contempt
that it has for the United States and for human rights.	</B>













<P><B>	As China flexes its political muscles, threatening to invade Taiwan,






















ignoring human rights and selling weapons of mass destruction to Pakistan
and other countries, the United States must respond by tightening trade






















restrictions.  Last year China imprisoned Harry Wu, an American citizen who
had spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps.  It is from these very prison
labor camps that China has been exporting products.   Wu was granted admission
to China. After entering the country was arrested for espionage and faced
a possible death sentence.  The death penalty is a serious risk in China
where more than 1,000 "criminals" were executed last year. </B>













<P><B>	In its very essence "trade" means that we get something of value in






















exchange for our products. Trade is a two-way street.  But trade with China
has not been a two-way venture.  We sold China $11.7 billion worth of products
in 1995, but bought a whopping $45.6 billion worth, leaving us a massive
$34 billion deficit, second only to the trade deficit which we have with






















Japan.</B>













<P><B>	Back in the good old days of 1970 we did not trade with China at all.






















 Quian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister, said recently, "For twenty-three






















years before Richard Nixon opened the door of relations between China and
the United States there was no trade.  I think you lived quite well.   And
so did we."  This is only half true.  We lived quite well 23 years ago, in
fact in many ways better than we do now, but the Chinese did not.  China's
per capita income has blossomed in the past two decades while ours has declined.






















  In 1973 the United States did not have a trade imbalance with the rest
of the world.  We were in fact on top of the world, with an improving standard
of living, low unemployment and a very low federal budget deficit.  </B>













<P><B>	We really don't get anything of lasting value from China.  We purchased






















two million military-style assault weapons from China in 1993.  These products






















have a negative value to American consumers.  I recently noticed that after






















playing at a video arcade my children were "awarded" whoopee cushions that
were manufactured in China.  Whoopee cushions, like assault rifles, have
a negative value.  We can live better lives without these useless products.</B>













<P><B>	Other Chinese products are no better.  Most, if not all, of the






















Chinese-made toys are virtually guaranteed to self-destruct within 48-hours
of purchase.  Just look at the broken toys around your house and you'll see
where they are made.  Then look at the ones that have lasted for years: 
Little Tikes, Lionel Trains, Tinker Toys, and you'll realize that the toys
with lasting value are made in the USA, or Europe.  Or take Chinese crayons.






















 Millions of Chinese crayons have been recalled because of lead contamination.






















 Chinese crayons are cheaper than American-made Crayola's, but at what






















cost?</B>













<P><B>	With workers paid fifty cents per hour or less it is not surprising
that the Chinese produce clothing cheaper than we do.  Not better, cheaper.
 Would you rather have one well-made American shirt, or two poorly made Chinese






















ones?   I would rather have one made in the USA employing well-paid American






















workers.</B>













<P><B>	Fully half of our shoes are made in China.  Reeboks, Nikes, all those






















highly advertised American-sounding brands made many of their shoes in China,






















paying workers twenty-five cents an hour.  But remarkably, these shoes do
not sell for less than those made in the USA.  </B>













<P><B>	Why do we grant Most Favored Nation (MFN) status to China and not
trade at all with Cuba?  President Clinton made the mistake of granting MFN
to China and "delinked" this status from their human rights record.  By doing






















this Clinton gave the Chinese the wrong signal, and China has used that sign
as a green light to clamp down on dissenters, arrest Harry Wu and sell nuclear






















materials to Pakistan.</B>













<P><B>	China does not deserve MFN status and we should revoke it immediately.






















 Yes, this may provoke a trade war with China.  So what?  Since trade with
China harms the United States, a trade war would do little harm here, but
would be devastating to China.  I understand that Boeing and a few other
major U.S. companies would be harmed by a trade battle with China, but what
about the  700,000 net jobs lost to Chinese imports?</B>













<P><B>	When human rights and democratic reforms are instituted in China,
we will see a dramatic increase in the wages paid to Chinese workers.  When






















workers in China are paid a reasonable wage, we will see our deficit with
that country dramatically reduced.  We must be prepared to fight by increasing






















tariffs and be prepared to battle the other symptoms of Chinese Trade Syndrome.






















 Otherwise, our children will not have jobs and we will buy most of our goods






















from dictatorial Third World nations, making the United States itself a






















third-class nation unable to help the developing democracies of the world.</B>
