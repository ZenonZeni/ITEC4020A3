UK FEATURE-FILM INVESTMENT CONTINUES TO RISE, DESPITE FOREIGN FALL OFF

Investment in films with UK production company involvement rose
significantly in 1995, despite a slight drop in the overall amount of
money put into UK-linked features.

A total of #309.54 million was invested in 76 UK-producer films -- that
is, wholly UK productions and international co-productions involving UK
companies -- that went into production between January 1 and December 31
last year.  Both figures were the highest for at least 15 years (using
current price comparisons).  The average budget was #4.07 million, the
best figure for at least four years.

The investment total represents a rise of 19.4 per cent on the #259.26
million spent on the 70 UK-producer films that went before the cameras
in 1994 (Screen Finance 8:1), and is 133.8 per cent higher than the
#132.4 million spent on 60 such films in 1993 (Screen Finance 7:1).

However, the amount of money invested in the five films shot by foreign
producers in the UK was only #111.25 million, 37 per cent less than the
#176.50 million put into eight such films in 1994 (although it was 38
per cent higher than the #81.3 million put into seven such films in
1993).

As a result, total investment in all UK-linked productions fell
slightly to #420.79 million.  This was 3.4 per cent lower than the
#435.76 million figure recorded in 1994, but still 97 per cent above
the #213.7 million invested in 1993.

The drop in overall investment came despite the fact that the total
number of 81 film starts was three more than in 1994 (Screen Finance
8:1), and 14 up on 1993 (Screen Finance 7:1).

But the relative lack of foreign films is likely to be a short-term
phenomenon, given the number of big-budget features that have
provisionally booked space in UK studios for this year.  These include
the $65 million Fifth Element, Cinergi/Really Useful Group's Evita and
Warner Bros' The Avengers (Screen Finance 8:17).

A total of 40 features were wholly UK in origin -- that is, they were
made solely by British production companies -- with a combined budget of
#169.59 and an average budget of #4.24 million.  Of these films, 35
were shot mainly or wholly in the UK and had a combined value of
#135.67 million.  The other five were shot mainly or wholly abroad and
represented a further investment of #33.92 million.

The level of investment in wholly British features is noticeably higher
than in 1994, when 38 such films were made (33 of them mainly or
entirely in the UK) with a combined budget of #110.96 million and an
average budget of #2.92 million.  In 1993 there were 31 films in this
category with a total value of #62.39 million (average #2.01 million).

There was also an increase in the number of international co-
productions involving UK producers.  There were 36 films in this
category last year, with a combined investment of #139.95 million
(average #3.89 million).  This compares with 32 co-productions in 1994
(total investment #148.30 million, average #4.63 million) and 29 in
1993 (total investment #68.01 million, average #2.35 million).

However, UK producers played the leading or equal role in only 11 of
last year's co-productions (of which only four were shot mainly or
wholly in Britain) with a combined value of #52.14 million (average
#4.74 million).  The remaining 25 co-productions, with a combined
budget of #87.81 million (average #3.51 million), had only a minority
UK involvement.  Given that 22 of these were shot mainly or wholly
abroad, it is likely that only a small proportion of this money will
have accrued to the UK production sector.

The generally positive picture for UK production is reflected in the
number of medium-to-large-budget UK films.  Last year 15 of the 76
films with UK-producer involvement (19.7 per cent) had budgets of #6
million or more.  While this is slightly down on the 1994 figure of 17
out of 70 (24.3 per cent) it is well up on the 1993 total of three out
of 60 (five per cent).

And last year's total includes four features with budgets of more than
#15 million -- the #20 million Fierce Creatures from Fish Productions
and Jersey Films, the #17 million Goldeneye from Eon Productions, the
#18 million Blood and Wine from Recorded Pictures (see below) and the
#15.5 million Pinocchio from Allied Pinocchio in collaboration with
Davis Films of France and Etamp Film Productions of the Czech Republic.
 Only the fourth of these was not a wholly British production.

This figure compares with two films in this category in 1994, one in
1993, and none in 1992.

Main investors

Polygram Filmed Entertainment was again one of the heaviest investors,
backing eight of the 76 films with UK-producer involvement -- Jude the
Obscure, Trainspotting, Walking and Talking, Dead Man Walking,
Pinocchio, The Eighth Day, The Pillow Book and This the Sea.  It also
backed one of the five foreign films shooting in Britain -- Portrait of
a Lady

Miramax, as usual, was the most active US backer, with money in five UK-
producer projects -- Brassed Off, Emma, I Love You -- I Love You Not, The
Last of the High Kings, and Snakes and Ladders.

Twentieth Century Fox had three UK-producer projects -- The Secret
Agent, Blood and Wine and Stealing Beauty.  Walt Disney also had three
in this category -- The Wind in the Willows, Firelight and La
propietaire (The Proprietor) -- plus two US projects shooting in the UK
-- The Muppet Treasure Island and 101 Dalmatians.

Three US investors backed two UK-producer projects each: United Artists
(Goldeneye and Richard III); Trimark (Proteus and Crimetime); and New
Line/Fine Line (Twelfth Night and Total Eclipse).

Single project investors included Universal (Fierce Creatures), Unapix
(The Proposition), Warner Bros (Surviving Picasso), Summit (Twelfth
Night), Visionary Communications (Two Blind Mice), Columbia Tristar
(The Wind in the Willows), Castle Rock (Othello), Kushner Locke
(Pinocchio), HBO Showcase (Deadly Voyage) and the Overseas Film Group
(This is the Sea).

Two other US companies backed foreign productions shooting in Britain --
Paramount (Mission Impossible) and October Films (Breaking the Waves).

As in other years there was an almost total lack of commercial UK
investors, other than the usual ones such as J&M Entertainment,
Majestic Films and Television and Capitol Films, with the occasional
distributor pre-buy from distributors such as Entertainment, First
Independent, Guild and Electric/Polygram.

Private investors are evident in a handful of films.  But only one of
these, the #4.5 million Grotesque, had a budget of more than #2
million.

One noticeable continuing trend is the decline of low-budget films
(those with budgets of less than #2 million).  This year 23 of the 76
UK-producer films (30.3 per cent per cent) fell into this category, and
16 of the 40 wholly-UK films (40 per cent).  This compares with the
1994 figures of 28 out of 70 UK-producer films (40 per cent) and 20 out
of 38 wholly-UK films (52.6 per cent).  In 1993 the figures were 34 out
of 60 (56.7 per cent) and 20 out of 31 (64.5 per cent per cent).

Last year also saw the first decline for some time in the number and
proportion of films depending on some members of the cast and crew
deferring their fees -- a practice which applies almost entirely to
wholly-UK films.

In 1995 only four of the 40 wholly UK films (10 per cent) relied to a
greater or lesser extent on this approach -- Bob's Weekend, Driven,
Respect and Two Blind Mice.  This compares with 14 out of 33 in 1994
(42 per cent) and 10 out of 28 in 1993 (36 per cent).

There was also one minority-UK co-production using deferrals last year
-- This is the Sea.

Subsidy money

Of the 76 features involving UK producers, 35 received some form of
public subsidy.  Thirty of these were international co-productions.

Far and away the most active body was Eurimages, the Council of
Europe's co-production fund, which backed 21 UK-producer projects
(including five in which the UK company was the lead producer).
Unfortunately, this line of finance is now being closed following the
UK government's decision last November to withdraw from the fund (see
separate story on page 12).

Of the UK sources, British Screen Finance provided backing from its
main fund for four films -- The Near Room, Nothing Personal (formerly
All Our Fault), Richard III and Sweet Angel Mine (Screen Finance 8:23).

The European Co-production Fund, which is administered by British
Screen, has supported five films -- Total Eclipse, This is the Sea, The
Killer Tongue, Portraits Chinois and The Castle of the Monkeys.

A key emerging UK source is the Arts Council of England (ACE), which
provides National Lottery money for film production and backed three of
the films that went into production last year -- A Midsummer Night's
Dream, The Woodlanders and Crimetime.  The ACE, and the parallel Arts
Councils of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, have also provided
Lottery money for a number of forthcoming productions (Screen Finance
8:22).

Other bodies providing funds included the Glasgow Film Fund, which
backed The Near Room, Small Faces (aka Easterhouse) and Carla's Song.

Television finance

As usual, there was also a major contribution from television companies
both from the UK and other European countries.  At least 43 of the 76
UK-producer films received support from one of these sources.

Channel Four, as in previous years, was by far the most active.  It
backed 19 films that went into production in 1995, compared with 12 in
1994 and eight in 1993.  These were Beautiful Thing, Brassed Off,
Guardians, Indian Summer, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Trainspotting, The
Woodlanders, Walking and Talking, Carla's Song, Crimetime, The Hollow
Reed, A Further Gesture, The Disappearance of Finbar, Trojan Eddie,
Truth (aka Mike Leigh's Untitled '95), Nothing Personal, Portraits
Chinois, La proprietaire and The Pillow Book.  The Welsh Channel Four,
S4C, backed one film, The Proposition.

The BBC backed six films compared with four in 1994 and two in 1993.
Last year's films were Different for Girls (aka Crossing the Border),
Jude the Obscure, Small Faces, Twelfth Night, Deadly Voyage and Swann.

BSkyB backed six films -- The Bruce, Richard III, The Near Room, Sweet
Angel Mine (aka Love's Executioner), The Castle of the Monkeys, This is
the Sea -- mostly through its output deal with British Screen.

However, no films received investment from any of the ITV companies.

Canal Plus, the French pay-television channel, backed three co-
productions involving UK companies -- I Love You -- I Love You Not, The
Butterfly Effect, and The Castle of the Monkeys.  It also backed the
foreign-produced Breaking the Waves.

Two other European broadcasters, RTE of Ireland and TVE of Spain, also
backed three co-productions each.

EC FINALLY ISSUES CALLS FOR IO TENDERS

The European Commission last week finally published its long-awaited
calls to tender for the contracts to run the four Intermediary
Organisations (IOs) that are to be set up under the Media II
initiative, successor to the Media Programme which officially came to
an end last month.

Final discussion of the IO tenders took place at the December 15
meeting of the Media Committee and the documents were made public on
January 5.  These call for applications to be submitted by February 23.
 The EC is hoping that the winners will be selected by mid-April (ahead
of the start of the Mip-TV programme market on April 19), and that the
IOs will begin operation by May or June.

However, the documents say that tenderers must keep their proposals
open until November 23, suggesting that there are fears that the
selection process could be considerably extended.

The EC is now hoping to issue the invitations for bids from potential
beneficiaries -- that is, the call for potential end users to apply for
Media II funds -- by the end of this month.  Various draft proposals
were discussed at the December 15 of the old Media Committee, and will
be considered further at the January 22 meeting of the new Media II
Committee which is to replace it (but which is likely to have
essentially the same membership).

The delayed date for issuing the call for bids for the first round of
funds will almost inevitably put back the timetable for submissions.
For instance, it will be very difficult to maintain the timetable of
submitting bids for training projects in February, to be followed by
decisions in March (Screen Finance 8:23).

The January 22 meeting is also due to discuss the rules and regulations
for the governing of the Committee itself.

The Committee has been strengthened according to EC ``commitology''
lore, improving its role from a purely advisory one to something with a
few more teeth.  The result is that the Committee can advise on more
decisions, and has to be consulted each time that a project is in
excess of the budgetary ceilings laid down by the Council of Ministers
-- Ecu200,000 for training, Ecu300,000 for development, and Ecu500,000
for distribution (Screen Finance 8:22).

If the Committee and the Commission disagree on a matter of policy, the
Council of Ministers will be informed.  In such an event, the
Commission must defer taking action on the point for two months.  The
Council can then decide on a different course, should it disagree with
the Commission's position.

IO tenders

The EC documents say that contracts for the four IOs -- covering the
areas of training, development, distribution and management/finance --
will be awarded for an initial year, which will then be extendable on
an annual basis to take the total to a maximum of five years.  At the
beginning of each contract, the IOs will be paid 30 per cent of the
year's forecast expenditure.  Actual costs will be reimbursed on a
quarterly basis.

Tender proposals will have to address every aspect of the Commission's
desires for each specific IO.  Any proposal that does not will be
rejected.

In addition, the Commission published the implementation decisions of
the Council of Ministers which describe the events which led to the
establishment of each programme, the aims of the programmes, the
percentage of funding they can contribute to projects they support, and
the role of the Media II Committee in each initiative.  The plans cover
a five-year span from January 1 1996 to December 31 2000.

Distribution and development

The distribution and development programme will have a combined five-
year budget of Ecu265 million.  It will have two separate IOs.  Tenders
for these IO contracts will be judged on the quality of the work
schedule put forward, the tenderer's specific expertise in the areas of
audiovisual development and distribution, the ability to respond
quickly to the Commission, and financial conditions.

Beneficiaries under this scheme must supply 50 per cent of their
project funding themselves.

The Commission estimates that the distribution and development IOs will
generate the following number of contracts per year:

Theatrical distribution      225
Video publishing              50
Television broadcasting       50
Promotion/market access       20

Total contracts              345

The distribution and development IOs will have two calls for proposals
each year, and two selection jury meetings.

The distribution IO should be designed to strengthen European cinema
and video distribution by improving networking, encouraging the
transnational distribution of European film product, and promoting the
worldwide circulation of European television programming.  It should
focus on video publishing, television broadcasting and supporting
networks of cinema theatres programming European films.  In addition
the distribution programme is geared toward active support of
linguistic diversity in the audiovisual sector as well as the promotion
of independent European production.

In the development area, the aim is to offer financial and technical
assistance to the development of production projects.  The development
mandate specifically mentions the promotion of animation via new
technology.  The development IO is intended to provide support for
production projects, the development of European production companies,
and the creation of industrial platforms in new technologies, animation
and the enhancement of the audiovisual heritage.

Media training programme

The training programme will have a five-year budget of Ecu45 million.
Its mandate is to give audiovisual industry professionals the skills
they need to ``manage projects and businesses that make a real impact
on the market.''  The idea is for the training part of the programme to
support professional training in the areas of economic and commercial
management and new technologies in two ways.  The first involves long-
term post-graduate courses as well as training courses for trainers.
The second involves shorter-term training modules for the continuing
education of industry professionals.

The Commission hopes that the training network fostered by this
initiative will create a forum for the exchange of all kinds of ideas
that will help the European audiovisual sector to stay competitive in
the global marketplace. Recipients of funding under the training scheme
will have to put up 50 per cent of their budget themselves, or 25 per
cent in very special (and as yet unspecified) cases.

The Commission estimates that the training IO will make two calls for
proposals each year and have two selection jury meetings.  It is
anticipated that the training IO will generate 80 contracts per year.

Management IO

The management IO will be a Brussels-based organisation which will
assist in the management and financial planning for Media II as a
whole.

It is still a somewhat controversial topic, as it is not clear what
sort of jurisdiction, if any, the management IO will have over the
other IOs.

Overall IO duties

The following is a general list of how the Commission views the duties
of the various IOs:

General tasks:

1. Advice on measures to be taken

2. Processing of project submissions

3. Setting up and operation of a database

4. Setting up an information, publication and distribution system

UK FURY OVER PLANS TO CHANGE TELEVISION DIRECTIVE

The UK's Department of National Heritage has reacted angrily to several
amendments to the European Union's transfrontier broadcasting directive
which were adopted this week by the European Parliament's culture
committee.

The DNH described as ``just bloody stupid'' an amendment which would
give broadcasting jurisdiction to the countries receiving a particular
channel instead of to the country in which the broadcaster is
established.

The DNH said that the amendment goes against the underlying principle
of the directive: this is that member states should accept broadcasts
which are properly licensed for distribution in another member state.

The UK was also angry at the latest in a long line of attempts to
tighten up the directive's requirement that channels should have at
least 51 per cent of programming made in Europe.  The DNH said that
amendments passed by the committee went against a ``political
agreement'' between the member states to stick with the existing
wording.

However, the council of culture ministers, which was responsible for
the wording of the directive sent to the parliamentary committee, will
get a further chance to quash the changes.

The amendment made this week by the parliamentary committee threw out
the controversial phrases ``where practicable'' and ``progressively on
the basis of suitable criteria'', which the UK and some other states
have used to justify a relaxed interpretation of the quota requirement.
 They replaced them with a clear three-year timetable for compliance.

Another amendment disqualifies certain new types of light entertainment
programming from counting towards a broadcaster's 51-per-cent quota.

However, the DNH welcomed the committee's rejection of several other
controversial amendments, including one which would have banned
advertising breaks during programmes aimed at children, and another
which would have required a health warning before advertisements for
alcoholic drinks on television.

The amended directive will be considered by the full parliament on
February 12.  But the committee has still not finished going through
the 225 amendments proposed by euro-MPs: another 20 will be considered
at a meeting next Tuesday.  The committee has so far adopted 51
amendments.

The full parliament is expected to reject some amendments before
sending a revised draft to the council of culture ministers.  The
council will then attempt to reach a so-called ``common position'' on
the amended draft, which must then be submitted for final approval by
the parliament.

The most controversial of all the 1989 directive's provisions has been
the one requiring quotas of European-originated programmes.  After many
arguments between the UK which believes that the quotas should be
scrapped completely, and France, which believes they should be
tightened, the culture ministers eventually opted, at the end of last
year, to retain the directive's existing wording (NMM 13:42).

The DNH said that it is ``absolutely opposed'' to the latest amendment
under which certain light-entertainment programmes would not count
towards the quotas.  Talk shows made in Europe, for instance, would not
be eligible.  The DNH said that the amendment, if adopted, would remove
``a lot of investment and employment which is generated by these
shows'' in Europe, and would leave only drama, documentaries and films
to contribute to the quotas.   At present, many general entertainment
channels balance the (mainly US) films they show with European talk
shows.

A senior commission official denied that the amendment would hit soap
operas such as Coronation Street and EastEnders, despite the fears of
some UK regulators and television executives.  He said that these would
still count towards the quotas.  However, he added that the council and
the parliament are heading towards a collision on quotas and that there
would ``have to be a compromise'' to resolve it.

Neither the UK nor the commission is happy with the amendment which
switches jurisdiction of broadcasters to the countries receiving the
broadcasts.  The DNH said: ``If you give the receiving country
jurisdiction, you're multiplying the number of countries with
jurisdiction in a way which would make the whole thing unworkable.''

A senior commission official said that ``it is not to be taken for
granted that the parliament will accept what the committee has
proposed''.  It is thought likely that the amendment will be rejected,
either by the parliament or when the draft is returned to the council
of ministers.

The UK is also opposed to an amendment which would extend the scope of
the directive to cover ``point-to-point'' services, such as video-on-
demand.  It said that these services should properly be considered
separately under telecoms legislation.

NOVEMBER ADMISSIONS FALL BY 5.2 PER CENT

UK cinema admissions for the whole of 1995 now seem set to reach a
total about nine per cent below the record figure returned in 1994,
which saw admissions rise by 9.7 per cent in comparison with 1993.

According to figures from the Cinema Advertising Association (CAA),
November admissions to cinemas taking advertising totalled 8,498,275, a
fall of 5.2 per cent on the record figure of 8,960,554 admissions
recorded for November a year ago (Screen Finance 8:1), but ahead of the
November 1993 figure of 7,619,875 (Screen Finance 7:1).

Admissions to cinemas not taking advertising -- the National Film
Theatre and about half the British Film Institute-supported Regional
Film Theatres -- added about another 85,000 to take the all-cinemas
total for November to around 8.6 million admissions.

Average weekly admissions for November were 1.98 million, among the
lowest figures for 1995, but a strong performance for the month when
compared to other November results, coming in second only to last
year's November weekly average of 2.09 million.

The total number of visitors to CAA-monitored advertising cinemas in
the first 11 months of the year was 104,244,582, down 9.8 per cent on
the comparable figure of 115,540,746 for November 1994 (Screen Finance
8:1), and only 352,637 admissions ahead of the corresponding 1993
figure of 103,891,945.

According to Screen Finance estimates, admissions to non-advertising
cinemas add another 1.08 million to take the end-November total for
1995 to approximately 106 million.

The top-grossing film of November was Goldeneye, the first Bond film in
six years, which opened on November 24, and took #5,554,527 in its
first week.  It was followed by Crimson Tide, which opened on November
3 and took #4,221,056 for the month.  Other strong performers in
November were Disney's Pocahontas (with #2.3 million), the UK/USA co-
production French Kiss (with #1.8 million) and To Die For (with #1.5
million).

End-1995 results

According to Catherine Booth-Clibborn of the CAA, December 1995
admissions are expected to top the 1994 result for the month, thanks to
several strong performers at the box office.

UIP's Goldeneye has continued to perform well at the box office, taking
over #9.2 million during December, and taking third place in the list
of top box office performers for the year with #14,785,676, just behind
Batman Forever and Casper.

Other strong box offices performers were Babe, The Santa Clause, and
Ace Ventura -- When Nature Calls, which took #3.2 million in its first
week.

If the December 1995 admissions figure does indeed exceed that for the
same month in 1994, this would imply a total of about 8 million,
bringing the end-of-year total to about 112.3 million for advertising
cinemas.  Given the Screen Finance estimate of approximately 1.2
million admission for 1995 for non-advertising cinemas, this would take
the end-of-year total to about 113.5 million, only 8.6-per-cent lower
than the total admissions figure for 1994.

UK FILM PRODUCTION

There was only one production start last month -- one more than last
year.  This was the #3.1 million A Further Gesture, a UK-led co-
production by CSL Films in partnership with with Samson Films of
Ireland and Road Movies of Germany.

This film, which went before the cameras in Dublin on December 3, is
backed by Channel Four, Pandora of Germany and Nippon Film and
Development (NDF) of Japan.  It is also receiving subsidies from
Eurimages, the Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen and the Irish Film
Board, and has some investment raised through Ireland's section 35 tax-
incentive scheme.

A Further Gesture is directed by Robert Dornhelm from a Ronan Bennett
script, and produced by Chris Curling.  It stars Stephen Rea as an
escaped IRA prisoner on the run in New York, who finds himself caught
up in a plot to carry out a political assassination.  After its initial
three weeks in Dublin, the film is scheduled to continue shooting in
New York for five weeks from mid-January.

Two other films started in November but were omitted from the Screen
Finance list for the month (Screen Finance 8:22).

One is the latest Recorded Pictures production Blood and Wine, which is
being directed by Bob Rafelson from a script he wrote in collaboration
with Nick Villiers, and produced by Jeremy Thomas.  It went into
production on November 27 in Miami, Florida.  The #18 million film is
backed by Twentieth Century Fox, which has taken English-speaking
rights, and by Majestic Film and Television, which is handling sales in
the rest of the world.

Blood and Wine stars Jack Nicholson, Judy Davis, Michael Caine, Stephen
Dorff and Jennifer Lopez.  Nicholson plays a womanising wine dealer
whose weaknesses have brought him to desperate straits.  He devises the
perfect crime to solve his financial problems at a stroke.

The other film was Firelight, a majority UK-co-production between
Carnival Films and Wind Dancer Productions of the USA, which began
shooting from November 27 at Pinewood, and from January 3 to mid-
February in Sussex and Normandy.

The #5.15 million feature is directed by William Nicholson, produced by
Brian Eastman of Carnival and executive-produced by a five-person team
from Wind Dancer, led by Matt Williams.  It is backed by Hollywood
Pictures.  The film stars Sophie Marceau, Stephen Dillane and Kevin
Anderson.  It tells the story of a beautiful Swiss governess and an
English landowner who meet in secret to fulfil the terms of a business
agreement; the encounter lasts three days, and awakens a desire that
changes their lives for ever.

DNH PONDERS DECISION ON EURIMAGES FUNDING ROUND

The UK's Department of National Heritage will have to decide in the
next month whether it is prepared to amend its stance on Eurimages, the
Council of Europe co-production fund from which it controversially
decided to withdraw last November.

The DNH, which has seen its decision come under strong criticism from
UK film-makers and other Eurimages members, has been told that it will
have to provide more money if it wants UK-linked projects to be
considered for backing at the next funding meeting of the Eurimages
board of management, which is scheduled for February 6 and 7.

Twelve of the projects on the agenda have UK producers.  Many of them
had already submitted their applications when the DNH make its shock
withdrawal announcement on November 29 (Screen Finance 8:22).  While
some of these applications will be withdrawn for various reasons in the
next few weeks, half can be expected to remain on the list by the time
the meeting convenes.

Eurimages has told the DNH that if it wants UK-linked projects to be
eligible for this funding round, the first of five in 1996, then it
will have to provide at least one fifth of its projected subscription
for the year.  This would be about #450,000 at current exchange rates.
Under this arrangement, the UK's active membership would end after the
February meeting, although according to the rules of Eurimages, its
actual membership would continue until the end of the year.

But the DNH is proposing to pay only #300,000 -- representing the
remainder of the money that it had allocated for Eurimages out of its
budget for 1995-96 (the UK government operates on the year to the end
of March, whereas Eurimages operates on the calendar year).

So the DNH appears to be faced with a choice between finding another
#150,000 to satisfy the Eurimages requirement for the February meeting,
or taking back its #300,000 and leaving the UK producers high and dry.
But it may be able to negotiate a compromise.

The other 23 members of Eurimages say that the UK should pay the whole
of its subscription for 1996, because it has not followed the correct
procedure for withdrawing from the organisation (Screen Finance 8:23).
These countries concede that they cannot actually force the UK to
comply, but say that it is likely to come under considerable diplomatic
pressure if it does not do so.

UK film-makers argue that the withdrawal decision should be reversed
altogether.  This view was strongly put to the national heritage
secretary Virginia Bottomley at a meeting with leading film-makers
organised by the Producers' Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact)
on December 21.

The meeting was attended by Lord Attenborough, chairman of the British
Screen Advisory Council (BSAC), Simon Perry, chief executive of British
Screen Finance, Andrew Quinn, chairman of the British Film Commission,
Sir Sydney Samuelson, the British Film Commissioner, Wilf Stevenson,
director of the British Film Institute, John Woodward, chief executive
of Pact, Fiona Clarke-Hackston, director of BSAC, David Norris of law
firm Marriott Harrison, who is vice-chairman of film at Pact, Simon
Relph of Skreba and Greenpoint, who is vice-chairman of film at the
British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta), Steve Woolley of
Scala Productions, who is a council member of Bafta, and Richard Holmes
of Gruber Brothers, representing the New Producers' Alliance.

The purpose of the meeting was for these UK film industry
representatives to express their frustration and disappointment with
the policy decision.  Having ``expressed their views forcefully'',
according to one participant, the group is now awaiting Bottomley's
response, promised for the New Year.

If Bottomley refuses to budge, the consequences for UK producers could
be fairly dire.  Already, 11 projects have dropped a UK co-producer
from their roster because non-members are not eligible for Eurimages
funds, according to Barrie Ellis-Jones, the British executive secretary
of Eurimages, who has himself felt obliged to resign as a result of the
DNH decision.

UK executives believe that there may be some room for negotiation on
the point of how much the UK should pay for its annual subscription.
``It's likely it is not just a matter of money, but a matter of the
handling of the event,''  according to Clarke-Hackston.  ``I still
believe DNH could go to Eurimages and say they've got a budgetary
problem.  They would have to make it clear that the UK would stay in
for a specified number of years, but I don't think the situation cannot
be resolved.''

But Eurimages president Gaetano Adinolfi says that it would be
impossible to reduce the UK's annual subscription.  He says that every
year the total Eurimages budget has grown according to the voluntary
increases agreed to by all of its members.  Last year the UK
contributed FFr19.5 million to the total Eurimages budget of FFr160
million.  Even without the UK's presence, the 1996 budget should run to
about FFr140 million, representing an increase for the remaining
members.

Adinolfi made clear his opinion of the UK move shortly after it was
announced six weeks ago: ``Every member of the Council of Europe has a
free choice of whether to be a member of the Fund or not.  However, I
have been working in the Council for over 40 years and I do not
remember anything of this kind happening before.''

EURO AIM TALKS DRAG ON, WITH AUDIT AND LEGAL ACTION

Euro Aim, the Media 95-backed initiative to support independent
European production, is still negotiating with the European Commission
in an attempt to resolve the long-running dispute over the EC's refusal
to hand over the money the agency says it is owed.

Euro Aim says that the EC owes it Ecu3.7 million, representing the
remainder of the Commission's contribution to the agency's 1994 budget
and the whole of its contribution to the 1995 budget.

Although Euro Aim reopened after Christmas on January 8 with its staff
still essentially intact, except for a few who had been employed under
limited term contracts, the organisation is weeks away from bankruptcy,
according to executives.  The Commission supplies 42 per cent of Euro
Aim's total budget, and without its contribution, the agency has had to
suspend its attendance at any of the important television and film
markets where it had functioned as an umbrella organisation for
independent European producers.

Euro Aim, which initiated legal action against the Commission on
December 4, had a court hearing scheduled for December 15 (Screen
Finance 8:23).  But neither side was willing this week to comment on
the status of the court action, which is bound up in the settlement
negotiations.

The talks are also linked to the outcome of the audit of Euro Aim's
books which the EC had demanded as a prerequisite before handing over
any funds.  This audit, which was carried out by the Commission's
accountants in collaboration with an outside firm of auditors, was
completed in the week before Christmas (Screen Finance 8:22).  But
neither side is willing to discuss the results.

Although Euro Aim has not been able to attend any markets without EC
funding, it is continuing talks on a proposed joint venture to create
an electronic trading system which could very well lessen the
importance of such events.  The online system would allow producers and
distributors to access real-time information concerning film and
television productions in development.

Euro Aim is partnered in the venture by the Dutch electronics giant
Philips.  The two are seeking other collaborators after losing their
third partner last month as a result of the EC row (Screen Finance
8:22).  Executives expect within the next month to compete the business
plan for the scheme -- which envisages a three-year start up phase
during which a commercial network of users will be brought together.

BRITISH SCREEN PLANS NORTH-WEST SHORTS STRAND

British Screen Finance (BSF) is furthering its commitment to a regional
focus for its short film funding scheme with the initiation of Short
Wave, a northwest-oriented strand modelled on the Prime Cuts programme
which is already under way in Scotland.

British Screen is setting up the north-west strand in partnership with
Granada Television and the Merseyside-based Moving Image Development
Agency (Mida).  It is intended to fund the production of six short
films, each of which will last twelve-and-a-half minutes and will have
a budget of #30,000.

The Short Wave strand, like the Scottish one, is being set up on a one-
off basis, but is likely to be repeated next year.  Other regional
strands are likely to be set up in the near future, possibly including
strands in Northern Ireland, Wales and the south-east.

The various strands are being set up to replace the Short and Curlies
programme which BSF used to fund in partnership with Channel Four.  BSF
withdrew from this programme last year, partly because it wanted to
develop projects with a more regional edge (Screen Finance 8:4).  It
also wanted to spread its annual shorts budget -- currently running at
about #150,000 -- over more projects.  The four or five projects backed
each year under Short and Curlies had budgets of about #90,000 each.
The projects backed under the new strands will have budgets of no more
than a third of this.

The three partners in Short Wave are still hammering out the final
details of their agreement.  But Granada has pledged #60,000 to the
programme, according to Mike Spencer, the executive in charge of the
company's participation, leaving the remaining #120,000 or so to be
divided between the other two.  Mida will contribute money from its
``Objective I'' fund, which is part-backed by the European Regional
Development Fund (Screen Finance 8:15).  It will also be running the
strand's publicity programme it expects to launch later this year.

Writers will be invited to submit scripts from the beginning of next
month, with a deadline in April.  The partners expect to start filming
over the summer.  The films will air on Granada in the autumn, most
likely on a weekly transmission after the News at Ten,
although a one-hour compilation would be another possibility.

The partners will be looking for fictional scripts (comedy or drama) of
which some may be animations.  The films will also have a ``northwest
feel'' to them.  ``There will probably be no restrictions as to age,
background or experience, says Spencer.  ``But the films will have to
be about the northwest. It would help particularly if the talent was
from the northwest.''  Roger Shannon, the head of Mida, says that
projects are expected to come from northwest-based writers and
directors.

The Scottish Prime Cuts initiative, which was BSF's first regional
short film project, also involves three partners -- BSF, Scottish
Television and the Scottish Film Production Fund.  This scheme, which
was set up last April,  involves six projects, each of which will last
five minutes and will have a budget of #23,000.  These projects, which
were chosen in October, will be shot in February and March and will
subsequently be shown on Scottish Television.

The total funding for the programme is #160,000, including #140,000 for
production and #20,000 for administration, publicity and promotion.  Of
this total, about #60,000 was provided by the Scottish Film Production
Fund, using some of the National Lottery money it has been allocated by
the Scottish Arts Council.  The other #100,000 was divided evenly
between BSF and Scottish Television.

One of the benefits of the programme for Scotland, according to
Catherine Aitken, project developer at the Scottish Film Production
Fund, is that it has brought British Screen's head of development
Steven Cleary into the region with more frequency, thus drawing to his
attention the wealth of burgeoning Scottish talent.  ``It is a good
thing for Scotland,'' says Aitken.  ``The response to Prime Cuts and
the quality of the applications reflect what is happening in the
Scottish film industry.''

The six projects for this year's strand were chosen from a short-list
of 18 which was itself whittled down from an original list of 175
applications.

All of the projects had to be based in Scotland, using Scottish crews.
But the themes could be universal.  Although there were no specific
criteria on gender, it has turned out that three of the six films are
to be directed by women.  All of the films are dramas, and none are
animated.

UK MULTIPLEX MARKET SET FOR NEW SURGE OF GROWTH

The UK multiplex market, which has been experiencing fairly steady
expansion for the past three or four years, with about six new
multiplexes being opened every 12 months, could be set for a new spurt
of growth if operators' current plans come to fruition.

UK operators say that they are planning to open 22 new sites in 1996,
with a total of 201 screens, to take the installed base to 101 sites
with 907 screens.  A further 16 sites are already planned for 1997.

This would represent a growth rate that would be considerably higher
than the one enjoyed in the boom period of 1989-91, when operators were
launching an average of 14 sites a year.

The current expansion plans involve a mixture of larger multiplexes,
with up to 14 screens, together with smaller multiplexes of between
five and eight screens, representing two distinct operator approaches.

The large operators, which have plans for 15 multiplexes in 1996, with
a further 11 already on the books for 1997, are concentrating on large
sites.  They are attempting to reach an audience which traditionally
does not visit cinemas regularly by including several leisure
activities in one place, so that a visit to the multiplex can be
combined with a meal or even some shopping.  They also aim to expand
their audience by covering the market more thoroughly, building in
areas which do not have easy access to traditional cinemas and offering
more variety in mainstream movies.

The smaller operators are looking at smaller sites with a view to
expanding in the art market, which they see as under-exploited.  Peter
Buckingham, managing director of Oasis Cinemas, thinks that the art
market could benefit from some form of expansion, whether through the
opening of smaller multiplexes or through more traditional cinemas,
which would give more people access to art films.

Six in 1995

For the third year running, there were six multiplexes opened in the UK
in 1995, four by large chains and two by smaller independents.  These
sites represent an increase of 44 screens, to which two further screens
were added by a National Amusements expansion to an existing site.

Among the large operators, Odeon Cinemas and Warner Bros Theatres each
opened two new multiplexes in 1995.  Warner Bros launched an eight-
screen 1,900-seater in Cambridge in June and a nine-screen 2,500-seat
multiplex in Leicester in July.  The Odeon chain opened one in Hemel
Hempstead in August, with nine screens and 1,600 seats, and one in
Lincoln in November, with six screens and 1,000 seats.

Among the smaller operators, Apollo Leisure opened its first multiplex
in Rhyl, with five screens and 750 seats, and now has plans for at
least four more multiplexes over the next two years.  And Oasis Cinemas
opened the five-screen Ritzy in Brixton, which has 830 seats and is
aimed mainly at filling a gap in the art market.

The other change in the multiplex landscape in 1995 was the addition of
two screens to the National Amusements' multiplex in Coventry, taking
the number of screens to 14 and the number of seats to 4,440.  This
type of conversion seems to be one of the main trends for the future.

One further multiplex which had been planned for the end of 1995
(Screen Finance 8:12), the Film Network six-screener planned as part of
the new Nynex Arena in Manchester, has been put back to 1996.

These openings take the total number of multiplexes to 79 with 706
screens.  Multiplexes thus account for 10.4 per cent per cent of the
762 sites in the UK and 34.3 per cent of the 2,057 screens.

Future developments

One of the most active developers is Odeon, with seven projects on its
books for 1996: a five-screen project in Camden, a six-screen complex
in Wrexham, an eight-screen complex in Southend, two nine-screen 2,000-
seaters in Guildford and in Sunderland and a 12-screen complex planned
for Glasgow.  These new sites will, if they all go ahead, take the
number of Odeon multiplexes to 17 sites with 127 screens.

Another interesting operator to follow in 1996 and 1997 is Warner Bros,
which announced in August that it plans to build about 20 new
multiplexes in the UK, all with at least eight screens and 2,000 seats.
 This will involve investment of about #75 million in the London area,
and a further #65 million in the rest of the UK.

Sheffield (Meadowhall), 9 scrs, c2,000 seats (1997)
Bristol, 9 scrs, c2,000 seats (1997/98)

*these multiplexes are conversions, as opposed to new builds.

Two Warner sites are opening on January 17 -- one in Croydon, part of
the Valley Park Leisure Complex, and one in Watford.  They will be
followed by a nine-screen 2,200-seater in Harrow on April 26, an eight-
screen 2,000-seater in Finchley in July and a nine-screen 2,500-seater
in Dagenham in December.  If all of these go ahead on time, Warner will
have 17 multiplexes by the end of this year, with 152 screens.

In addition to these, Warner has plans for four further builds in 1997,
in Leeds, Glasgow, Meadowhall in Sheffield and in Bristol, which will
take the total to 21 sites with 188 screens.

Another strong investor in the multiplex market in 1996 will be the
start-up company Cine-UK, which has announced that it is planning to
invest #40 million into the UK market over the next few years on at
least 14 multiplex developments (Screen Finance 8:12).  In accordance
with their policy to invest in smaller catchment areas, a sector which
has not been the chosen target of other major operators, Cine-UK has
plans for four multiplexes in Ashford, Stevenage, Wakefield and
Wandsworth, each with between 10 and 14 screens and 1,900 and 3,000
seats.  All are scheduled to open in the last quarter of 1996.

United Cinemas International (UCI) has plans for two multiplexes in
1996, at Surrey Quays in London and in Leeds.  Both will have nine
screens with about 2,000 seats.  These would take the UCI total at end-
1996 to 26 sites and 243 screens, with an additional site planned at
Crystal Palace for a long delayed nine-screen multiplex to open in 1997
(Screen Finance 7:19).  UCI has also said that it is looking for
suitable sites for up to four additional projects.

Another large operator with plans for 1996 is National Amusements,
which is expecting to open a 14-screen development in Coatesbridge at
the end of the year, which would take its total to 12 sites and 157
screens.  In addition, according to Ed Knudsen, general manager of
advertising and publicity, the company is still developing a 14-screen
development in Reading and another in Newham, both scheduled for 1997.

The MGM chain, which was bought last year by the Virgin Group from
Credit Lyonnais for #195 million, is also planning to expand, initially
under its own name, although there are suggestions that it may take on
the Virgin banner in the long run.  Virgin/MGM has announced one build
for 1996, a nine-screen project in Rochester which will seat 2,256.
This will take the number of Virgin/MGM multiplexes to 19 with 143
screens.  In 1997, Virgin/MGM has plans for four nine-screen
multiplexes, in Oxford, Wigan, Aberdeen and Newport.

Of the smaller independent operators, in addition to the Film Network
development in Manchester, there are plans for four Apollo Leisure
multiplexes -- one 10-screen build in Huddersfield with 2,100 seats to
open in the autumn of 1996, two five-screens in Barrow and Gately, and
a six-screen conversion from a four-screen in Barrow, all expected for
some time in 1996/97.

Robins Cinemas is also planning three conversions, a five-screen at
Mile End for 1996, and two five-screens (from three) in 1997, one in
Camberley and the other in Basildon.  According to Ben Friedman,
managing director, this is part of a new ``policy of rationalisation in
the sites, investing in larger sites with more screens in larger towns,
rather than investing in smaller towns.''

This means that by the end of 1997, independent multiplex operators
will be running about 15 sites with 111 screens.

In addition to all these projects, one other operator, American Multi-
Cinemas (AMC) is expected to re-enter the UK market in the near future,
having announced plans to invest in up to 20 sites with 24 screens each
(Screen Finance 8:12).  AMC says that it is currently searching for
suitable sites in the UK but has not yet made any decisions on specific
projects.

LEADING FILM COMPANIES WANT COPYRIGHT CHANGES

European film companies are in danger of missing out on the
opportunities of the future unless copyright laws are amended to take
account of the digital age, according to the European Film Companies
Alliance (Efca), a group of seven leading European media conglomerates.

The group has this week been asking the European Commission -- which was
holding discussions on copyright with interested parties on January 8
and 9 -- to ensure the creation of a suitable legislative framework to
protect copyright, and the implementation of global rules to enforce
the rights of copyright owners.

Efca argues that Europe's position in the entertainment and cultural
sector will be determined by the level of copyright it grants to its
film companies.  It says that the USA has always had strong copyright
laws, and that this has been a significant factor in the strength of
the USA in the global entertainment market.

The members of the group -- Bertelsmann, Chargeurs, Ciby 2000, Polygram,
Rank, RCS and Sogepaq -- are concerned that the emergence of digital
transmission methods for films and music will soon make it impossible
for copyright owners to enforce their rights to payment for the user of
their works.  They say that if owners' investment is to be maintained,
it will be necessary to update the current legal definitions regarding
broadcasting, rental, distribution and reproduction in order to take
account of new digital technologies and consumer habits.

Efca argues that copyright protects the expression of intellectual
creation.  ``If the creative industries are prevented from realising a
commercial gain from the use of their products, they will have little
incentive to associate themselves with the information society.''  It
says that this could cost Europe dearly in terms of jobs and
investment.

The seven members say that there are three main issues that need to be
addressed regarding the electronic transmission of music and films:

* They argue that film companies should be granted the exclusive rights
to authorise or prohibit the distribution and copying of their material
on electronic networks such as the Internet.  This will enable them to
control the commercial usage of their productions.

* They maintain that these exclusive rights are essential if the
industry is to avoid the ``damaging'' principle of compulsory licensing
whereby companies are ``forced to sell their output at pre-determined
rates''.  They believe that it is much better to leave such matters to
the market.

* They say that copyright legislation can be effective only if it is
properly enforced, and that co-operation between the hardware and
creative industries will be essential in order to devise technological
standards for systems of protection.  Efca is calling on the Commission
to take a leading role in ensuring that this takes place, arguing that
legislation will be required in order for any such technical protection
to be effective.

NEW BODY CREATED TO AID MEDIA II TRAINING BIDS

A new trade association has been set up by a group of European
audiovisual industry professionals who share a common interest in the
possibility of proposing new independent training initiatives in
response to calls for tender under Media II.

The new body, which is known as the Trade Association for New Training
Initiatives (Tanti), is intended to provide a method of communicating
with the European Commission and national ministries on points of
interest and concern regarding the aims, target groups, content and
techniques of training as well as the procedure for the award of funds
under Media II (see separate story on page one).

The association, which is a loose grouping of individuals without any
officers, is also designed to provide a means of exchanging information
between members on the timing and procedures of calls for tenders,
expressions of interest, bids and the evaluation and results of bids.

The members of Tanti (which means numerous in Italian) are all people
who have taken part in training initiatives under the old Media
Programme and are considering participating in the new one as well.
They see the creation of the new body as a means of reminding the EC
that there are other people interested in offering training under Media
II apart from those involved in the existing structures.

The association contains a number of members in London, including
Michael Ryan and Matthew Payne of J&M Entertainment, Katrina Wood of
MediaXChange, John Durie of Strategic Film Marketing, Julian Friedmann
of Blake Friedmann, Sandy Lieberson of the National Film and Television
School and Angela Jackson of Angela Jackson Solicitor.

Others include Philippe Kern of Polygram and Geoffroy de Foestraets of
Coppens van Ommeslaghe Hormans & Fauras (both in Brussels), Luigi
Ferrara of Studio Legale Ferrara Santamaria (Rome), Jose Antonio Suarez
Lozano of Suarez de la Dehesa Abogados (Madrid), Margaret O'Connor of
Northern Arts (Newcastle), Kriton Metaxopoulos and Christine Pigaki of
A. Metaxopoulos Law Office (Athens) and Mathias Schwarz of Schwarz
Kurtze Schniewind Kelwing Wicke (Munich).

POLYGRAM TAKES FULL CONTROL OF GRAMERCY

Polygram Filmed Entertainment said this week it was taking full control
of Gramercy Pictures by buying Universal Pictures' 50-per-cent interest
in the company.

The deal, which involves an undisclosed sum, follows the expiry of the
initial three-year term of the joint venture between PFE and Universal.

Gramercy was set up by the two companies in May 1992 to handle the
North American marketing of distribution of theatrical films, and has
released such films as Four Weddings and a Funeral, The Usual Suspects
and Pricilla, Queen of the Desert.  The 14 or so films planned for this
year include Dead Man Walking, Farga and Portrait of a Lady.

Universal will continue to release a select number of films through
Gramercy including Grace of My Heart and Cold Comfort Farm.

UK BOX-OFFICE HOLDS STEADY AT #381 MILLION

The total amount taken at the UK box-office in 1995 was #381,361,499,
from 305 films on release.  The result is almost exactly the same as it
was the year before, when 299 films generated revenues of #381,871,307.

Given that admissions figures for the year are expected to be down by
about nine per cent (see separate story on page 5), this implies a
significant rise in average revenues per ticket.  This appears to be
due partly to an increase in prices, and partly to a relative absence
in 1995 of attractive children's films.

The statistics show that 186 US films were on release in the year,
grossing #319,157, 478 (83.69 per cent of the total) and averaging
#1,715,900 each.  Thirty two wholly-UK films were shown, earning
#32,954,094 (864 per cent) at an average of #1,029,815.  Seventeen UK
co-productions were on release, taking #6,881,635 (1.8 percent) at an
average of #404,802.

The figures thus continue to exhibit the distortion caused in 1994 by
the phenomenal success of the Rank/Polygram-distributed Four Weddings
and a Funeral, the most successful British film ever, which grossed #27
million, helping to push the UK share up to 10.53 per cent and US share
down to 85.63 per cent, compared with a usual level of more than 90 per
cent (Screen Finance 8:1).

The 1995 UK figures have also been skewed by the performance of a
single film - the UIP-distributed Goldeneye, which was released on
November 24 and had taken #14,785,676 by the end of December, or 3.88
per cent of the total box-office for the year.  This made it the third
most popular film of 1995 after Warner Bros' Batman Forever
(#20,013,560) and UIP's Caspar (#16,011,194).

The rest of the figures have been affected by the surprisingly strong
performance of the two Australian films which made in into the top 40 -
Muriels's Wedding (number 12 with #7,919,101) and Babe (number 18 with
#6,717,643).  The overall Australian total for the year was #14,720,199
(3.86 per cent).  The strong UK and Australian showings have combined
to keep the US share down.

But if Goldeneye is excluded, the remaining 31 wholly UK features
grossed only #18,168,418, for an average of #586,078.  This reflects
the fact that only three other UK films made it into the top 40 for the
year -- Shallow Grave (#5,078,079 and 23rd), The Madness of King George
(#4,258,079 and 28th), and Jack and Sarah (#3,195,793 and 40th).

No other non-US films made it into the chart.

Forty other European productions were on release over the year -- 28
national productions (15 from France) and 12 international co-
productions (with no UK participation).  The 40 films grossed
#5,196,465 (average #129,912), with the 12 co-productions taking
#2,392,725 (average #199,394).

The 30 releases from countries outside the USA and Europe earned
#17,171,826 (average #572,394).  But without the two top-rating
Australian films the figure would have been only #2,535,082 (average
#90,539).

The top distributor, as in previous years, was UIP.  Its 25 films
grossed #94,281,817 -- boosted by Caspar, Goldeneye and the fourth-
placed Apollo 13 -- to take 25.35 per cent of the market.

Next was Buena Vista, which released 32 films, more than anyone else,
helping to counter the fact that its top films Pocahontas and Die Hard
With a Vengeance came no higher than seventh and eighth in the chart.
It took a total of #77,759,690 (20.91 per cent).

In third place was Warner Bros with 24 releases and #68,047,766 (18.30
per cent).  Nearly half of this came from two films -- Batman Forever
and the sixth-placed Interview With the Vampire.

Fox was well behind with 17 releases and #24,654,826 (6.63 per cent).
This reflected the fact that after the fifth-placed Braveheart its next
best film was The Usual Suspects in 24th place.  Columbia Tristar
similarly had 18 releases and #23,483,992 (6.31 per cent).  Its best
film was Bad Boys in 22nd place.

No European company came anywhere near the top US-owned distributors.
None achieved more than six per cent of the market, and much of the
revenue they did get was due to a handful of films.

For instance, Guild was ranked sixth, with 13 releases taking
#19,394,278 (5.22 per cent).  But more than half of this was due to the
ninth-placed Stargate.  Similarly, Polygram (4.06 per cent) depended
heavily on Shallow Grave and Jack and Sarah, and First Independent's
2.97 per cent was almost entirely reliant on the performance of Dumb
and Dumber.

* The top film for the weekend of January 5-7 was Entertainment's
Seven, which took #2,628,821 from 300 screens over its first three
days.  This was the best opening since Goldeneye on November 24, and
contributed to a record-breaking aggregate of #7,408,828 over the
period (more than twice the figure recorded over the pre-Christmas
weekend).

This result put the Brad Pitt-Morgan Freeman thriller well ahead of
Warner Bros' Ace Ventura -- When Nature Calls, the new Jim Carrey
vehicle, which took #1,477,912 from 339 screens over its second
weekend, to take its total gross to #6,272,986.

Both films overtook the surprise Christmas hit Babe, distributed by
UIP, which had been at the top of the chart for the previous three
weeks.  Its most recent weekend take of #1,451,553 from 360 screens
took its total gross so far to #10,057,900.

Only one UK-linked film was released in the last four weeks -- Ate de
Jong's All Men are Mortal, a co-production led by Sigma Picture
Productions of the Netherlands in partnership with Nova Film of the UK
and Rio of France.  This film stars Stephen Rea and Irene Jacob, was
released by Warner on January 5 and took #2,490 from three screens over
its first weekend.

Apart from Babe, only four other non-US films were released over the
period.  Jean Cocteau's 1946 classic La Belle et la Bete was re-
released by the BFI on December 15 and took #14,141 before ending its
run two weeks later.  The White Balloon, the festival hit from Iranian
director Jafar Panahi, was released by Electric on December 29 and has
so far taken #37,241.

Jean-Paul Rappeneau's 1830s swashbuckler The Horseman on the Roof was
released by Artificial Eye on January 5 and took #49,920 from 14
screens over its first three days.  Lars von Trier's The Kingdom was
released by the ICA on the same day and gained a weekend take of #3,717
from once screen.
