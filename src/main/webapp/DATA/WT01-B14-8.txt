To keep an eye on the progress of your investment, you can turn to many sources
of information. Here's a quick review of what Kemper provides:
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Your quarterly statement.</B> You'll find your fund's year-to-date
total return through the end of the previous month and its average
annual
total returns as of the closing date of the previous quarter shown in
the fund summary of your quarterly statement. 
<BR><BR>

Total return and average annual total return are a measure of net
investment income and capital gain or loss from portfolio investments,
assuming that dividends are reinvested. While total returns are not
adjusted, average annual total returns are adjusted for the maximum
sales charge or the contingent deferred sales charge in effect at the
end of the period. Average annual total return reflects annualized
change while total return reflects aggregate change. 
<BR><BR>

Our goal is to mail your statement as close to the end of the quarter as
possible, which restricts our ability to print your fund's returns as of
the date of the close of that quarter. 
<BR><BR>
 
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B> KemperACCESS.</B> For up-to-date Kemper fund and account information 24
hours a day, seven days a week, call our automated telephone response
system. By calling 1-800-972-3060 on a touch-tone telephone, you can
receive the following information:
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Account balance <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Most recent transactions <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Dividend earnings <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Current yields and returns <BR>
<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> Current net asset values <BR>
<BR>

Selected account transactions also are available.
<BR><BR>

Are you a first-time caller? Don't be stumped when asked to enter your
Personal Identification Number (PIN) - your PIN is the last four digits
of your Social Security number. (You can change your PIN by following
KemperACCESS instructions.)
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B><I>Instant Profiles.</I></B> This quarterly publication presents performance
data about each fund in the Kemper family of funds. Asset size,
portfolio
composition and applicable duration and maturity information also are
reported. 
<BR><BR>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE> <B>Annual and semiannual shareholder reports.</B> A comprehensive report
of your fund's six-month performance is mailed to you twice a year. In
it
you will find an economic overview from Kemper's chief investment
officer, a question-and-answer with the fund's portfolio manager and
detailed performance and financial data.
<BR><BR>

Reminder: Please remember that the performance of your individual
investment may differ from the total return reported by your fund. The
total return on your investment will depend on when you purchased your
shares, at what price and how you handle dividends and other
distributions. Your financial representative is the best source you can
turn to for help in reviewing your Kemper investment.
