<h2>Ineffectiveness of the Act and Effectiveness of Alternative Means</h2>

<font size = +1>

<p>106.  The overwhelming majority of content on the
Internet is non-sexual in nature, and is not even arguably
"indecent" or "patently offensive," even for minors.  However, a
significant amount of the content on the Internet could arguably
be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors in some
communities, and the Act bans or burdens all of that content.

<p>107.  Although imposing extreme burdens on the
Internet, the Act will in fact have very little impact on the
availability to persons under 18 of "indecent" or "patently
offensive" images or communications on the Internet.  At least in
part because Congress held no hearings on the Act, did not
collect information about how the Internet works, and only
haphazardly reviewed the content on the Internet, the Act does
not accomplish or even significantly further the ostensible goal
of limiting access by persons under 18 to "indecent" or "patently
offensive" images.  There are at least two reasons why
implementation of the Act will be highly ineffective as a
limitation on such access.

<p>108.  First, a high percentage of sexual content on the
Internet originates outside of the United States, and it is not
possible to prevent that content from being "available" in the
United States.  To the extent the Act imposes any burdens on
domestic commercial providers of such communications, those
providers will have the option of moving their operations
overseas.

<p>109.  Second, the existence of "anonymous remailers"
means that any content -- indecent or otherwise -- can be placed
onto the Internet anonymously, and the government would be unable
to identify the content provider.  Anonymous remailer systems --
which often are located overseas -- will automatically receive a
communication and forward it to a destination after having
removed all trace of the origin of the communication.

<p>110.  At bottom, therefore, the Act does little to
limit the ability of commercial or non-commercial entities to
provide "indecent" or "patently offensive" images on the
Internet.

<p>111.  A critical difference between the Act's attempt
to regulate indecency on the Internet and prior governmental
attempts to regulate indecency (over radio, television, and
telephone sex lines, for example) is that there are tens of
millions of speakers on the Internet, with no bottleneck through
which all of the speech must pass.

<p>112.  There are alternative means that are far more
effective in limiting a minor's access to "indecent" or "patently
offensive" communications.  The only place where it is
practically possible to screen out commercial indecency, non-
commercial indecency, domestic indecency, overseas indecency,
intentional indecency, inadvertent indecency, and anonymous
indecency is in the computer that is attempting to receive the
speech.

<p>113.  The government's legitimate interest in aiding
parental control over the Internet material their children access
may be served by several means that are both less restrictive and
more effective than a blanket ban on "indecent" or "patently
offensive" communications.  Parents have control over their
children's access to communications through interactive computer
services.  For example, parents can deny their child access to
the computer; parents can supervise their child's use of
interactive computer services; parents can decline to subscribe
to interactive computer services until their child is older;
parents can take advantage of the free screening and blocking
options available at no extra charge from commercial online
services; and parents can obtain software (some of it free, and
most of it for a very modest cost) for their home computers to
screen material they find objectionable.

<p>114.  Commercial online services such as America
Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy offer
technologies that allow parents to block their children's access
to certain online forums and areas where children might be
exposed to inappropriate content.  These online services, for
example, include a feature that allows parents to prevent their
children from accessing interactive discussion forums (chat
rooms).  They also offer parents the ability to block access to
all or portions of the Internet, including the World Wide Web and
USENET newsgroups, based on keywords, subject matter, or specific
newsgroups.  These tools can be configured to block access to
groups based on any keyword.

<p>115.  In addition, a variety of software providers have
developed applications to use in conjunction with commercial
online services, over and above the parental control features
provided by commercial services, while others are designed
specifically for direct access.  SurfWatch, for example, allows
parents to block their child's access to USENET newsgroups, World
Wide Web, gopher, and ftp sites with sexually explicit content. 
When activated with a private password held only by a parent,
SurfWatch completely prevents any user from accessing these
areas.  The service automatically updates the list of blocked
sites, without any intervention required from the user.  NET
NANNY, another example, contains a dictionary in which the parent
can enter the names of sites that contain sexually explicit or
other material.  Parents may also enter phrases which if
transmitted or received will automatically disconnect the
network.  Among other things, the program also keeps a log of all
activity that occurs on the computer, allowing parents to monitor
their children's use of the computer.

<p>116.  Products such as the Netscape Proxy Server and
WEBTrack provide schools and businesses the ability to block
specific sites from access by all users on the network, and to
track and monitor use of the Internet.

<p>117.  Because the Internet is a global network with
millions of users, speaker-based content restrictions cannot
effectively control the availability of materials inappropriate
for children.  The only effective way to protect children from
inappropriate material on the Internet is to encourage the
continued development and deployment of user-based tools that
empower parents to control their children's online activities
based on the parents' views of what is appropriate for their
children.  The products described here, and others like them,
provide parents these tools, and can do so without the need for
criminalizing or banning the distribution to adults of
constitutionally protected communications.
