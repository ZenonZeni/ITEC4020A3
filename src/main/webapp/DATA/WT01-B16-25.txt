  Development</h2></head>
<p><hr>
    <body><h4> 
  As a result of Congressional budget action for fiscal year
  1996, the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
  (OCRWM) has altered its plans concerning development and
  deployment of a multi-purpose canister (MPC)-based system.
  <p>
  OCRWM had established a three-phase procurement strategy for
  the MPC and begun work on an environmental impact statement
  (EIS). The first phase includes a detailed design of the MPC
  and supporting systems and the preparation of safety
  analysis reports for submittal to the Nuclear Regulatory
  Commission (NRC) for review and approval. OCRWM and the
  awardee, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, are working to
  complete the first phase by the end of April 1996. The
  second phase was intended to lead to NRC certification of
  the MPC-based system for storage and transportation. The
  third phase included procurement of the first MPCs and
  supporting components. With funds needed to complete phases
  two and three unavailable, OCRWM had to cease development of
  the technology beyond phase one.

<i>Plans to develop this proposed Multi-Purpose Canister-based system have been altered.</i>
<p>
  The idea of a universal system that could address spent fuel
  storage, transportation, and disposal was conceived by
  private industry, and several key organizations had
  previously encouraged the Department to develop the concept
  further. The NRC expressed concerns about functional
  compatibility as early as 1988 and codified these concerns
  in a 1990 rule that states, "To the extent practicable in
  the design of storage casks, consideration should be given
  to compatibility with removal of the stored spent fuel from
  a reactor site, transportation, and ultimate disposition by
  the Department of Energy."
  <p>
  OCRWM initiated development of the MPC system in response to
  these calls for standardization and compatibility among
  utilities' and the Federal Government's waste management
  systems. The MPC concept under development by OCRWM would
  have accommodated some 80 percent of all spent nuclear fuel
  to be discharged by the Nation's light-water reactors, and
  would have utilized a sealed canister for storage,
  transportation, and disposal. OCRWM personnel developed a
  schedule, in consultation with NRC staff, that would have
  enabled the first MPCs to be available in the fall of 1998.
  <p>
  A number of analyses were conducted to better identify and
  quantify the costs and benefits of implementing such an
  integrated-systems approach to spent nuclear fuel
  management. Obvious benefits included a large reduction in
  the number of spent nuclear fuel assembly handlings and a
  reduction in the number and cost of interfaces among
  utilities' and OCRWM's waste management systems.
  <p>
  OCRWM had insisted from the start that any decision to
  develop MPCs be grounded on, among other things, a
  broad-based support for doing so. To that end, OCRWM held
  two early-stage workshops to discuss preliminary
  considerations. The workshops were well attended by a broad
  spectrum of stakeholders, including prospective bidders on
  the MPC contract. Utility representatives, along with
  members of several environmental organizations, also
  contributed to OCRWM's decision to move forward with the MPC
  concept. Three MPC EIS scoping meetings followed in late
  1994. Feedback from the workshops and scoping meetings was
  positive.
  <p>
  As a result of strong encouragement of OCRWM's concept of an
  MPC-based system from the NRC, the Nuclear Waste Technical
  Review Board, the utility industry, and virtually all
  stakeholder groups, OCRWM revised its design of and
  operating scenario for the waste management system based on
  the MPC. In order to support OCRWM's efforts to develop an
  MPC system that would accommodate such a broad spectrum of
  spent nuclear fuel, the NRC established its Spent Fuel
  Project Office.
  <p>
  In light of Congressional action, OCRWM recently suspended
  all work on the Environmental Impact Statement for a
  Multi-Purpose Canister System for Management of Civilian and
  Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel. In this EIS, OCRWM was evaluating
  the environmental impacts of fabricating and deploying a
  standardized container system for the storage,
  transportation, and possible disposal of civilian and
  defense spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.
  OCRWM had been working jointly with the Department of the
  Navy on the EIS after the Department of Energy determined
  that naval spent fuel should be addressed in the EIS, since
  the Navy recognized the benefits of the MPC for storage,
  transport, and disposal of its spent fuel.
  <p>
  The Navy now has decided that it will proceed with the part
  of the MPC EIS covering naval spent nuclear fuel and, on
  December 7, 1995, published a Notice in the <i>Federal Register</i>
  stating that it would assume lead responsibility for the
  EIS. The Department of Energy's role will be limited to that
  of a cooperating agency in the preparation of the report.
  The Navy plans to issue the Draft EIS by April 30, 1996.
  Following issuance of the Draft, which will be announced in
  the <i>Federal Register</i>, a 45-day comment period will be
  provided. During the comment period, public hearings will be
  held. The locations and dates of these public hearings will
  be announced in the <i>Federal Register</i> when the Draft EIS is
  issued. The Navy plans to issue the final EIS by November
  30, 1996, and a Record of Decision by December 31, 1996.
  <p>
  OCRWM continues to believe that the idea of an integrated
  systems approach to spent nuclear fuel management that would
  address all three functions storage, transportation, and
  disposal and accommodate the vast majority of spent fuel
  designs, is a good one one that would produce benefits for
  utilities and the Federal Government. To that end, OCRWM is
  encouraging the private sector to work toward developing
  such an integrated systems approach.
