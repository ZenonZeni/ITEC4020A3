<PRE>     There  are  many forms of organic matter. Untreated sawdust,  aged
horse  manure,  and aged wood are common amendments and  can  be  found
anywhere. Aged wood soil conditioner, cocoa bean, mushroom compost, rice
hulls  or apple pumice are usually available regionally. Organic  waste
from your kitchen can be used to compost your soil as well as additions
of rock dust.
     Other  amendments are: leaf mold, pine bark and bark chips, straw,
sand,  coffee grounds, grass clippings, shredded cardboard, bat  guano,
eggshells,  grapefruit skins, potato skins, and wood chips  and  ashes.
Organic  matter  should be added to your soil before you  start  a  new
lawn.  You should do this when the weather is fairly settled, so the ground
will  be  prime  for  planting and the new grass will  have  only  mild
competition from weeds. The Best Organic matter to add is in  the  form
of Compost. See chapter on compost.
<STRONG><H2>Organic Fertilizers</H2></STRONG>
     Soil,  in  order  to  be  alive, must have  high  organic  matter,
drainage  and  good structure. Natural fertilizers  add  to  the  soil,
improving its fertility, maintaining and contributing to the improvement
of  these necessary elements. Organic matter and rock powders form  the
basis  of  organic fertilizers, and benefit the soil  as  well  as  the
plant.  As a rule, chemical fertilizers are not a complete plant  food.
Organic material contains nutrients which provide the microorganisms in
the soil with the materials they need to be active.
     Organic  Fertilizer mixes usually contain composted animal manure,
plant  residues,  seaweed and fish products, and minerals  (bone  and
blood   meal,  cottonseed  meal,  granite  dust,  phosphate  rock   and
greensand).  Organic  Fertilizers should be used  in  combination  with
compost in order to develop rich, humousy soil.
     Compost: Composting is practiced today just as it was hundreds  or
thousands of years ago. The recirculation of dead matter into life  is
a part of nature's program of soil rejuvenation.
     A  gardener's compost heap is a process that is going on eternally
in  nature.  When we cut the grass and remove it we are cutting off the
cycle.  Therefore compost, when added back to the lawn,  re-establishes
the  cycle and returns nutrients and bacteria to the soil. The gardener
takes a tip from nature and uses this simple method to build the soil's
fertility.
         <STRONG><H1> "Compost is the Finest Natural Fertilizer there is"</H1></STRONG>
     Horse Manure
     Among the manure of other farm animals, horse manure is one of the
most  valuable. It is richer in nitrogen than either cow or hog manure,
and  ferments much more quickly, therefore being referred  to  as  "hot
manure".
     Manure  provides organic matter and trace minerals  to  the  soil.
Your  lawn  will  benefit by having a thin layer of aged  (at  least  6
months old) horse manure spread over it (using a manure spreader),  and
then  watered  well.  This  should be  done  twice  per  year  or  even
seasonally if you can do it.
     This  practice  will  also benefit the microbes  as  well  as  the
beneficial insects. But the best top dressings are made from well  made
compost  because it provides a more complete and varied food source  as
well as varied bacterial sources. Run through shredder for best results.
