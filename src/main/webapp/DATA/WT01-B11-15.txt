<P> Citro&#235;n's first brush with the RCE was a variant idea of de
Lavaud.  <A HREF = "nsu.html">NSU</A> and Citro&#235;n formed a company
called Comobil in 1964 or 65.  In 1967 they set up Comotor S.A. in
Luxembourg.  In 1970 some Citro&#235;n M35s were made which used an NSU
KKM 500 engine in modified Ami 8s.  They have hydraulic suspension like
the GS and 49 hp for a top speed of 144 kmh (89 mph) (compare this with
the Ami 8's 123 kmh or the 1973 Ami Super's 140 kmh).  212 were made in
1970 and 49 in 1971.

<P> GS Birotor: Citro&#235;n GS Birotor with a KKM 622 (107 bhp).  This
was first shown at the 1973 Frankfurt automobile show.  I think this may
have had the Berline body style.  They had a top speed of 175 kmh from
107 DIN hp (vs. 151 kmh, 60 hp for GS).  834 were built in 1974, 31 in
1975.  A Van Veen OCR 1000 used a 100 bhp Comotor engine, probably the
KKM 622, in 1974.  It had a top speed of 150 mph.

<BLOCKQUOTE> There was a review in one of the car magazines last year
[1991] of a Citro&#235;n GS Rotary.  Citro&#235;n bought most of them
back to avoid having to carry spares (they'd made about 600) but a few
escaped.  The test was against an <A HREF = "nsu.html#Ro80">NSU Ro80</A>
and involved driving to Reims and back [to England presumably].  There
are rumours of a three-rotor CX.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

on the M35.

<P> In the Sixties, <STRONG>Renault</STRONG> was working on designs of
its own, in order to avoid NSU licensing fees.  The rotors had four
lobes in a five chambered housing.  In a departure from the simplicity
of the <A HREF = "dr-wankel.html">Wankel</A> rotary, they used ten
poppet valves.
