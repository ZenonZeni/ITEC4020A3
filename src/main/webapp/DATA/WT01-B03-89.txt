<BR> November 1, 1996<BR>
<BR> TOMS RIVER, NJ  -  <A HREF="tgcacji.html">Charles J. Irwin, General
Counsel</A> of <A HREF="tgca.html">Tribal Gaming Commission Administrators,
Inc. (TGCA)</A> announced the formation of Tribal Gaming Management, Inc. (TGM)
as a new resource for the Native American Gaming Industry.  Irwin, formerly Vice
Chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, and Gaming Commission
Chairman for the Chitimacha tribe of LA, currently serves as Consultant for
management &amp; regulatory affairs to the 29 Palms Band of Mission Indians in
Coachella, CA.<BR>
<BR> TGCA has been serving Tribal Government Gaming with a variety of training
and support services for the tribal leaders involved in casino regulation. 
Their most well known program is their <A HREF="tgcaacc.html">Tribal Gaming
Academy</A> which conducts both private and open-enrollment training programs on
casino regulation and control.<BR>
<BR> Motivated by a desire to support Tribal Government Gaming's positive
impact on participating tribes, Tribal Gaming Management, Inc. will focus a
blend casino management expertise, training experience, and regulatory
understanding on achieving successful casino operations.  &quot;Which,&quot;
according to <A HREF="tgcaaei.html">Arthur E. Irwin, President</A> of TGCA, &quot;requires
an understanding that Tribal Government Casinos are not entirely motivated by
profit.  In most instances, their primary purpose is to be engines of cultural
growth and economic opportunity for the community they serve.  We understand
that fact, and will provide a management team that assigns the tribe's
non-financial goals the priority they deserve.&quot;<BR>
<BR> &quot;In addition,&quot; Irwin continues, &quot;we'll focus the resources
of our Tribal Gaming Academy on the process of equipping tribal members to
assume total control of casino operations.  We can't guarantee success,&quot; he
adds. &quot;The motivation of the trainees themselves is critical to success or
failure, but we do guarantee an honest effort, by highly motivated training
professionals.&quot;  <BR>
<BR> Charles Irwin serves the 29 Palms Band of Mission Indians (CA) as
management &amp; regulatory consultant . He was Chairman of the Chitimacha
Gaming Commission (LA) during 1993 &amp;1994.  Irwin was appointed to the New
Jersey Casino Regulatory Commission in 1991, and served until April of 1993. 
Prior to that he was a member of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority. 
He also served as a member of the New Jersey Assembly (1968-1971), and as
Director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs (1971-1973).  An
attorney since 1960 he has practiced before both state and federal courts
including the US Supreme Court.<BR>
<BR> Arthur Irwin earned his MBA at the Harvard Business School after serving
as an officer in the Military Police Corps.  Following a career in commercial
banking, he began a small consulting firm and was honored as an outstanding
entrepreneur.  He is President of both TGCA and TGM, and Director of the Tribal
Gaming Academy.  Irwin has been an adjunct college professor for over 20 years. 
He served as both President of the United Way and Municipal Treasurer of his
community.<BR>
