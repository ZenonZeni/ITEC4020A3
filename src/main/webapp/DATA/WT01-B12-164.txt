<H3>KEMPER FUNDS MARKS 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATION'S FIRST RETAIL MUNICIPAL
BOND FUND</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (April 23) -- Twenty years ago this month Kemper Financial Services launched 
the <A HREF="../../funds/muni_bond.html">Kemper Municipal Bond Fund</A>, the nation's first municipal 
bond fund designed for individual investors.  The municipal bond mutual fund management was 
pioneered largely through the efforts and vision of the fund's first manager, the late Robert J. Butler.
<P>

"Bob Butler was noted for his work in developing new investment products, 
including the Kemper Municipal Bond Fund.  The introduction of a municipal bond fund 
tailored for individual investors represented a major innovation in tax-free investing and 
underscored Kemper's reputation as an innovator in the mutual fund arena," said Chris 
Mier, senior vice president and portfolio manager for all of Kemper's tax-free income funds. 
"The Kemper Municipal Bond Fund paved the way for wider participation in the tax-exempt 
market by individuals with small sums to invest."
<P>

From its inception date on April 20, 1976, the Kemper Municipal Bond Fund has had 
only three portfolio managers -- Robert Butler (1976 - 1985), J. Patrick Beimford (1985 - 
1992) and Chris Mier (1989 - present).  Kemper manages 10 
<A HREF="../../funds/taxfree.html">tax-free income funds</A>, including an intermediate-term fund and 
eight single state funds, representing assets of more than $5 billion.
<P>

<B>The Municipal Bond Market: Then and Now</B>
<P>

Chris Mier, a 20-year veteran of the municipal bond market, points out a number of 
significant changes in the municipal bond industry during the past two decades.
<P>

"While the municipal bond market has grown in size and sophistication, it is still a 
diffuse, over-the-counter market with no central trading arena.  What has changed are the 
make-up of the market, the players, the technology and the sophistication of portfolio 
management practices."  In particular, Mier cites:
<UL>
<LI>Market participants:  "Twenty years ago, most muni bond investors typically were banks, 
bank trust departments and property-casualty insurers.  Today, individual investors 
account for approximately two-thirds of muni bond holdings acting through mutual 
funds, trust departments and on their own behalf."
</LI><P>
<LI>Credit quality:  "Increasingly, insurance has become a major feature of the municipal 
marketplace.  In 1976, insurance on municipal bonds didn't exist.  In 1995, more than 
43 percent of new issuance came to the market insured."
</LI><P>
<LI>Market composition:  "In 1976, tax-free investing was fairly simple.  Plain vanilla general 
obligation bonds comprised roughly half of the municipal market.  Changes in tax laws 
at the federal and state levels altered the ways in which municipalities and states finance 
their capital needs.  At present, revenue bonds make up 62 percent of the muni bond 
market, and general obligation bonds now make up less than 38 percent."
</LI><P>
<LI>Technological advancements:  "Price information is more readily available today, 
resulting in narrower bid-ask spreads and a more efficient market.  Additionally, more 
professional investors are employing sophisticated analytical tools.  Today, fund 
managers are focused on complex strategies involving management of duration, 
convexity and option-adjusted spreads in the marketplace.  In the past, portfolio 
managers used a 'basis book' to calculate yields.  Now they use desktop computer 
systems to compute duration and other financial information."
</LI>
</UL>

<B>The Future</B>
<P>
Over the next several years, Mier sees a continuation of some of the trends that have 
helped shape the municipal bond market over the previous 20 years.
<P>

"Portfolio managers will make greater use of technology in order to employ more 
sophisticated trading techniques as well as sophisticated risk management and 
performance attribution tools," said Mier.
