<center><h5>You helped name the rescued mustangs</center></h5>
<p>Remember the contest we ran in our last mailer to name the rescued mustangs?  Betty White was very touched as she read through the reasons why you chose the names that you sent in, and had a difficult time picking only two.</p>

<p>The winning names are: for the mother (mare) - Whisper and for her daughter (filly) - Shadow.  But wait, that's not all...Whisper surprised us and turned out to be pregnant!  She gave birth to a beautiful little chestnut colt named Mirage.</p>

<p>We saved mother and daughter mustangs from the slaughter earlier this year.  Originally, captured by the Bureau of Land Management, they were adopted to a man who, as soon as he had legal title, brought them to the auction to sell for slaughter.</p>

<h4><center>Congratulations to the Winners of the Winter Drawing!!</center></h4>

<p>Redwings rescued mustangs, Shadow, Whisper, her new foal, Mirage and wild burros Brownie, Jenny and her new foal, Sage, are safe here at the sanctuary.   For the thousands of wild horses and burros who roam throughout the West on federally protected public lands they are anything but safe.</p>

<p>Wild horses and burros were considered a part of our American heritage, something to be protected and treasured for the future.  The public demanded this protection (resulting in 1971 Act to protect wild horses and burros) - at least that was the case in the past.  Public interest is no longer the driving force behind this protection.  The demands being put on the lands in the West for grazing (4 million cattle and sheep) and mine expansion have placed wild horses and burros in jeopardy.  This is evident in the increased funding within the Bureau of Land Management(BLM) for roundups.  Fewer wild horses and burros leaves more vegetation for cattle and sheep; thereby placating the ranchers who continue to apply tremendous pressure on the BLM.  If the public does not force the government to change its policies no one else will.</p>

<H5>PLEASE HELP END THE SUFFERING AND THE EVENTUAL EXTINCTION OF AMERICA'S WILD HORSES AND BURROS!</H5>

<p>Call Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt (202)208-3171 and President Clinton (202)456-1111 TODAY and tell them you're concerned about the wild horses and burros on the public lands and demand that President Clinton and Secretary Babbitt uphold the laws which were put in place in 1971 to protect them.   THANK YOU!</p>
