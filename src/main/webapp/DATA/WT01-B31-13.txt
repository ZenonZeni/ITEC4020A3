<p><b><u>REPORT OF THE INDIAN HEMP DRUGS COMMISSION, 1893-94. </u></b></p>

<p><b><u>APPENDIX<br>
</u></b></p>

<p><b>NOTE BY MR. J. M. CAMPBELL, C.I.E., COLLECTOR OF LAND
REVENUE AND CUSTOMS AND OPIUM, BOMBAY, ON THE RELIGION OF HEMP. <br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>To the Hindu the hemp plant is holy. A guardian lives in the
bhang leaf. As the wife of Vishnu, the preserver, lives in the
hysteria-curing <i>tulsi, </i>or Holy Basil, and as Shiva dwells
in the dysentery-scaring <i>bel, AE</i>gle<i> </i>marmelos, so
the properties of the bhang plant, its power to suppress the
appetites, its virtue as a febrifuge, and its thought-bracing
qualities show that the bhang leaf is the home of the great Yogi
or brooding ascetic Mahadev. </p>

<p>So holy a plant should have special rearing. Shiva explains to
his wife, Parvati, how, in sowing hemp seed, you should keep
repeating the spell 'Bhangi', 'Bhangi', apparently that the sound
of that guardian name may scare the evil tare-sowing influences.
Again, when the seedlings are planted the same holy name must be
repeated, and also at the watering which, for the space of a
year, the young plants must daily receive. When the flowers
appear the flowers and leaves should be stripped from the plant
and kept for a day in warm water. Next day, with one hundred
repetitions of the holy name Bhangi, the leaves and flowers
should be washed in a river and dried in an open shed. When they
are dry some of the leaves should be burnt with due repeating of
the holy name as a <i>jap </i>or muttered charm. Then, bearing in
mind Vagdevata, or the goddess of speech, and offering a prayer,
the dried leaves should be laid in a pure and sanctified place.
Bhang so prepared, especially If prayers are said over it, will
gratify the wishes and desires of its owner. Taken in the early
morning such bhang cleanses the user from sin, frees him from the
punishment of crores of sins, and entitles him to reap the fruits
of a thousand horse-sacrifices. Such sanctified bhang taken at
day break or noon<i> </i>destroys disease. Before the religious
user of bhang stand the Ashtadevata or Eight Guardians with
clasped hands ready to obey him and perform his orders. The wish
of him who with pure mind pours bhang with due reverence over the
Ling of Mahadev will be fulfilled.<br>
</p>

<p>Such holiness and such evil-scaring powers must give bhang a
high place among lucky objects. That a day may be fortunate the
careful man should on waking look into liquid bhang. So any
nightmares or evil spirits that may have entered into him during
the ghost-haunted hours of night will flee from him at the sight
of the bhang and free him from their blinding influences during
the day. So too when a journey has to be begun or a fresh duty or
business undertaken it is well to look at bhang. To meet some one
carrying bhang is a sure omen of success. To see in a dream the
leaves, plant, or water of bhang is lucky; it brings the goddess
of wealth into the dreamer's power. To see his parents worship
the bhang-plant and pour bhang over Shiva's Ling will cure the
dreamer of fever. A longing for bhang foretells happiness: to see
bhang drunk increases riches. No good thing can come to the man
who treads under foot the holy bhang leaf.<br>
</p>

<p>So evil-searing and therefore luck-bringing a plant must play
an important part in the rites required to clear away evil
influences. During the great spirit time of marriage in Bombay
among almost all the higher classes of Gujarat Hindus, of the
Jain as well as of the Brahmanic sects, the supplies sent by the
family of the bride to the bridegroom's party during their seven
days' sojourn includes a supply of bhang. The name of the father
who neglects to send bhang is held in contempt. Again, after the
wedding<i>, </i>when the bride-groom and his friends are
entertained at the house of the bride, richly-spiced bhang is
drunk by the guests. The Gujarat .Musalman bride before and after
marriage drinks a preparation of bhang. Among the Pardeshi or
North Indian Hindus of Bombay bhang is given not only at
weddings, but the Pardeshi who fails to give his visitor bhang is
despised by his caste as mean and miserly. Another great spirit
time during which bhang plays an important part is the time of
war. Before the outbreak of a war and during its progress the
Ling of Mahadev should be bathed with bhang. Its power of driving
panic influences from near the god has gained for bhang the name
of Vijaya, the unbeaten. So a drink of bhang drives from the
fighting Hindu the haunting spirits of fear and weariness. So the
beleaguered Rajput, when nothing is left but to die, after
loosing his hair that the bhang spirit may have free entrance,
drinks the sacramental bhang and rushing on the enemy completes
his <i>juhar </i>or self-sacrifice. It is this quality of
panic-scaring that makes bhang, the Vijaya or Victorious,
specially dear to Mahadev in his character of Tripur, .the slayer
of the demon Tripurasur. As Shiva is fond of <i>bel </i>leaves,
as Vishnu is fond of <i>tulsi </i>leaves, so is Tripuresvar fond
of bhang leaves. He who wishes to obtain his desires must
constantly offer bhang to Tripuresvar. </p>

<p>Bhang the cooler is a febrifuge. Bhang acts on the fever not
directly or physically as an ordinary medicine, but indirectly or
spiritually by soothing the angry influences to whom the heats of
fever are due. According to one account in the Ayurveda, fever is
possession by the hot angry breath of the great gods Brahma,
Vishnu, and Shiva. According to another passage in the Ayurveda,
Shankar or Shiva, enraged by a slight from his father-in-law
Daksha, breathed from his nostrils the eight fevers that wither
mankind. If the fever-stncken performs the Vijaya abhishek, or
bhang-pouring on the Ling of Shankar, the god is pleased, his
breath cools, and the portion of his breath in the body of the
fever-stricken pleased to inflame. The Kashikhanda Purana tells
how at Benares, a Brahman, sore-smitten with fever, dreamed that
he had poured bhang over the self-sprung Ling and was well. On
waking he went to the Ling, worshipped, poured bhang this cure
brings to Benares sufferers from fever which no ordinary medicine
can cure. The sufferers are laid in the temple pour bhang ever
the Ling whose virtue has gained it the name Jvareshwar, the
Fever-Lord. Bombay many people sick of fever vow on recovery to
pour bhang over a Ling. Besides cure for fever bhang has many
medicinal virtues. It cools the heated blood, soothes the
over-wakeful to sleep, gives beauty,<i> </i>and secures length of
days. It cures dysentery and sunstroke, clears phlegm, quickens
digestion, sharpens appetite, makes the tonic of the lisper
plain, freshens the intellect, and gives alertness to the body
and gaiety to the mind. Such are the useful and needful ends for
which in<i> </i>his goodness the Almighty made bhang. In this
praise of the hemp the Makhzan or great Greek-Arab work on drugs
joins... Ganja in excess uses abscess, even madness. In
moderation bhang is the best of gifts. Bhang is a cordial, a bile
absorber, an appetizer, a prolonger of life. Bhang quickens
fancy, deepens thought, and Judgment. As on other
guardian-assessed objects, the cow, the Vedas, or the leaf oaths
are taken on the bhang leaf Even to a truthful witness an<i> </i>oath
on of the be1 tree, dreaded. To one who forswears himself the
bhang oath is death the bhang leaf. So holy a plant must play a
leading part in temple rights. Shiva on fire with the poison
churned from the ocean was cooled by bhang. At another time
enraged with family worries the fields. The cool shade .of a
plant soothed him. He crushed and of the leaves, and the bhang
refreshed him. For these two benefits bhang is Shankarpri , the
Mahadev. So the right user of bhang or of ganja, before beginning
to drinker smoke, offers the drug to Mahadev saying, lena
Shankar, lena Babulnath: be pleased to take Shankar, take it
Babulnath. According to the Shiva Parann, from the dark
fourteenth of Magh (January-February) to the light fourteenth of
Asbadh (June-July), that is, during the three months of the hot
weather, bhang should be daily poured over the Ling of Shiva
every day, bhang should be poured at least during the first and
last days of this period. According to the Meru Tantra on any
Monday, especially on Shravan (July-August) Mondays, on all
twelfths <i>pradoshs, </i>and on all dark fourteenths or <i>shivratris</i>
still more on the Mahashivratri or Shiva's Great Night on dark
fourteenth of Magh (January-February.), and at all eclipses of
the sun or moon, persons wistful either for this world or for the
world to come should offer bhang to Shiva and pour it over the
Ling. Not every devotee of Shiva makes offerings of bhang. Such
rites in Bombay are seldom performed except in the Bhuleswar and
Babulnath temples and there only on special occasions. The bhang
offered to Mahadev is without pepper or other spice. It is mixed
with water, water and milk, or milk and sugar. It is poured over
the Ling. According to some authorities the offerer should not
touch the offered bhang. Temple ministrants Atits, Tapodhans,
Bhojaks, Bhopis, Bharadis, Gutaras alone should drink it. If
there are no ministrants the remains of the offering should be
poured into a well or given to cows to drink. Other authorities
encourage the offerer to the bhang, since by<i> </i>sipping the
bhang reaches and soothes the Shiva-Shakti or Shiva-spirit in the
sipper. On certain social occasions during failures of rain,
during eclipses, and also in times of war libations of bhang are
poured ever the Ling. </p>

<p>Vaishnavas as well as Shaivas make offerings of bhang. The
form of Vishnu Or, the Guardian to whom bhang is a welcome
offering is Baladev, Bainram, or Dauji, the elder brother
Krishna. Baladev was fond of spirits, not of bhang. But Banins,
Bhatias, and other high class Hindus, not being able to offer
spirits instead of spirits the offering of bhang to Baladev,
unlike the special offerings to Shiva, present bhang. In Bombay,
without an offering of bhang no worship of Baladev is complete,
offerings to Shiva is a common and everyday rite. Unlike the
plain or milk and sugared bhang spilt over the Ling, Baladev's
bhang is a richly-spiced liquid which all present, including the
offerer, join in drinking. Such social and religious ions
drinking of bhang is common in Bombay in the temple of Dauji in
Kalyan' Kirparam lane near Bhuleshwar. As in the higher class
worship of Baladev the liquor offering has been refined into an<i>
</i>offering of bhang so it is in the worship of Devi, Shiva's
early and terrible consort. On any Tuesday or Friday, the two
week-days sacred to Devi, still more during the Navrata or Nine
Nights in Ashwin or September-October, those whose caste rules
forbid liquor make a pleasing spices bhang. And as in, the
worship of Baladev all present, worshipper and ,ministrant alike,
join in drinking. Shitaladevi, the Cooler, the dread goddess of
small-pox, whose nature, like the nature of bhang, is cooling,
takes pleasure in offerings of bhang. During epidemics of
small-pox the burning and fever of the disease are soothed by
pouring bhang over the image of Shitaladevi. So for the
feverishness caused by the heats especially to the old no cure
equals the drinking of bhang. Unlike<i> </i>spirits the tempter
to flesh bhang the craver for milk is pleasing to the Hindu
religion. Even according to the staitest school of the objectors
to stimulants, while to a high caste Hindu the penalty for
liquor-drinking is death, no penalty attaches to the use of
bhang, and a single day's fast is enough to cleanse from the
coarser spirit of ganja. Even among those who hold stimulants to
be devil-possessed penalty and disfavor attach to the use of hemp
drugs only when they are taken with no religious object and
without observing the due religious rites. </p>

<p>At the other extreme of Hindu thought from the foes to
stimulants, to the worshippers of the influences that, raising
man out of himself and above mean individual worries, make him
one with the divine force of nature, it is inevitable that
temperaments should be found to whom the quickening spirit of
bhang is the spirit of freedom and knowledge. In the ecstasy of
bhang the spark of the Eternal in man turns into light the
murkiness of matter or illusionand self is lost in the central
soul-fire. The Hindu poet of Shiva, the Great Spirit that living
in bhang passes into the drinker, sings of bhang as the clearer
of ignorance, the giver of'knowledge. No gem or jewel can touch
in value bhang taken truly and reverently. He who drinks bhang
drinks Shiva. The soul in whom the spirit of bhang finds a home
glides intothe ocean of Being freed from the weary round of
matter-blinded self. To the meaner man, still under the glamour
of matter or maya, bhang taken religiously is kindly thwarting
the wiles of his foes and giving the drinker wealth and
promptness of mind. In this devotion to bhang, with reverence,
not with the worship, which is due to Allahalone, the North
Indian Mussulman joins hymning the praises of bhang. To the
follower of the later religion of Islam the holy spirit in bhang
is<i> not </i>the spirit of the Almighty. Itthe spirit of the
great prophet Khizr or Elijah. That bhang should be sacred to
Khizr isnatural. Khizr is the patron saint of water. Still more
Khizr means green, the revered colour of the cooling water of
bhang. So the Urdu poet sings 'When I quaff fresh bhang I liken
its colony to the fresh light down of thy youthful beard.' The
prophet Khizr or the Green prophet cries ' May the drink be
pleasing to thee.' Nasir, the great North Indian Urdupoet of the
beginning of the present century, is loud in the praises of his
beloved Sabzi, the Green one. 'Compared with bhang spirits are
naught. Leave all things thou fool, drink bhang.' From its
quickening the imagination Musalman poets honour bhang with the
title <i>Warak al Khiyall, Fancy's </i>Leaf. And the Makhzan or
great Arab-Greek drug book records many other fond names for the
drug. Bhang is the Joy-giver, the Sky-flier, the Heavenly-guide,
the Poor Man's Heaven, the Soother of Grief. </p>

<p>Much of the holiness of bhang is due to its virtue of clearing
the head and stimulating the brain to thought. Among ascetics the
sect known as Atits are specially devoted to hemp. No social or
religious gathering of Atits is complete without the use of the
hemp plant. </p>

<p>smoked in ganja or drunk in bhang. To its devotee bhang is no
ordinary plant that became , holy from its guardian and healing
qualities. According to one account, when nectar was produced
from the churning of the ocean, something was wanted to purify
the nectar. The deity supplied the want of a nectar-cleanser by
creating bhang. This bhang Mahadev made from his own body, and so
it is called <i>angaj </i>or body-born. According to another
accountsome nectar dropped to the ground and from the ground the
bhang plant sprang. It was because they used this child of nectar
or of Mahadev in agreement with religious forms that thee seers
or Hishis became Siddha or one with the deity. He who, despite
the example of the Hishis, uses no bhang shall lose his happiness
in this life and in the life to come. In the end he shall be cast
into hell. The mere sight of bhang, cleanses from as much sin as
a thousand horse-sacrifices or a thousand pilgrimages. He who
scandalizes the user of bhang shall suffer the torments of hell
so long as the sun endures. He who drinks bhang foolishly or for
pleasure without religious rites is as guilty as the sinner of <i>lakhs
</i>of sins. He who drinks wisely and according to rule, be he
ever so low, even though his body is smeared with human ordure
and urine, is Shiva. No god or man is as good as the religious
drinker of bhang. The students of the scriptures at Benares are
given bhang before they sit to study. At Benares, Ujjain, and
other holy places yogis, bairagis and sanyasis take deep draughts
of bhang that they may Centre their thoughts on the Eternal. To
bring back to reason an unhinged mind the best and cleanest bhang
leaves should be boiled in milk and turned to clarified butter.
Salamisri, saffron, and sugar should be added and the whole
eaten. Besides over the demon of Madness bhang is Vijaya or
victorious over the demons of hunger and thirst. <i>By </i>the
help of bhang ascetics pass days without food or drink. The
supporting power of bhang has brought many a Hindu family safe
through. the miseries of famine. To forbid or even seriously to
restrict the use of so holy and gracious a herb as the hemp would
cause widespread suffering and annoyance and to the large bands
of worshipped ascetics deep-seated anger. It would rob the people
of a solace in discomfort, of a cure in sickness, of a guardian
whose gracious protection saves them from the attacks of evil
influences, and whose mighty power makes the devotee of the
Victorious, overcoming the demons of hunger and thirst, of panic
fear, of the glamour of Maya or matter, and of madness, able in
rest to brood on the Eternal, till the Eternal, possessing him
body and soul, frees him from the having of self and receives him
into the ocean of Being. These beliefs the Musalman devotee
shares to the full. Like his Hindu brother the Musalman fakir
reveres bhang as the lengthener of life, the freer from the bonds
of self. Bhang brings union with the Divine Spirit. 'We drank
bhang and the mystery I am He grew plain. So grand a result, so
tiny a sin.''<br>

<p>NOTE BY BABU ABHILAS CHANDRA MUKERJI. <br>
</p>

<p>NOTE BY BABU ABHIILAS CHANDRA MUKERJI, SECOND INSPECTOR OF
EXCISE, BENGAL, ON THE ORIGIN AND HISTORY OF TRINATH WORSHIP IN
EASTERN BENGAL,. '<br>
</p>

<p><i>Date of origin.--In </i>1867 Babu Annnda Chandra Kali or
Kailai, of Dhamrai, a village in thana Sabhar of the Dacca
district, first started the worship at the house of his
father-in- law at Fattehpur in the Atia pargana of the Mymensingh
district (sub-division Tangail). <i>Antecedent: of the
originator.--Dhamrai </i>is an important village in the Dacca
district for its car festival, which is annually held in honour
of a local idol named <i>Madhab Thakur, </i>and which is
witnessed by a large gathering of people. Ananda Chandra received
education at the Dacca Normal School. After leaving school he
served for some time as a pundit (schoolmaster), and then entered
the Police Department, but was there only a short time. He is a
Barendra Brahman and belongs to a respectable family. He learnt
to smoke ganja when he was only a boy. His present age Is 60
years. He has the reputation of being a versifier. He smokes two
pice worth of ganja every day. </p>

<p>He married at Fattehpur in the Mymensingh district. There he
introduced Trinath worship 27 years ago. A <i>panchali </i>(poem)
reciting the praises and exploits of Trinath was first published
at Dacca in 1871 and the first edition (l,000 copies) was sold in
a few months. </p>

<p><i>The circumstances under which the worship was first
started.-Ananda </i>Chandra Kali was at the time living in the
house of his father-in-law. He was thinking of introducing the
worship of a common god, who might be worshipped by all classes,
rich and poor, Brahman and Chandal, and by all creeds, Saktas,
Baishnavas, and Shaivas, and the idea occurred to him of having
the present worship at which ordinary and inexpensive things,
such as ganja, oil, and betel-leaf, were alone to be used. · <br>
</p>

<p>Trinath (from Sanskrit <i>Tri, </i>three, and Nath, lord) is
represented to be Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, the Hindu Trinity in
one. </p>

<p>Being a ganja-smoker himself Ananda Kali may have also thought
that by introducing the worship he would be able to save the
ganja-smokers from disrepute, as then ganja could be consumed in
the name of a god and under colour of doing a religious or pious
act. </p>

<p><i>Religious aspect of the worship.--The </i>following
translation of the Introduction to the <i>Trinath Mela </i>Panchali
gives some idea of the subject : </p>

<p>The universe consists of the earth, the heaven, and the nether
world, and Trinath is the lord of these three worlds.<br>
</p>

<p>&quot;There was an incarnation of God in the form of Gour
(Chaitanya), who delivered· the sinners by preaching the name of
Hari, but the Lord was not satisfied with this, and became
concerned for the created, and soon he became incarnate again.
Brahma, Bishnu and Shiva, gods in three forms, manifested
themselves in one form. The one God, the Lord of the. universe,
seeing the miseries of mankind, came to their deliverance. Ananda
(Ananda Chandra Kali, the originator)declares that the true and
sincere worshippers of Trinath are sure to obtain salvation.
Brahma, Bishnu, and Shiva met together and expressed their
desire, </p>

<p>to come to this world in one form to receive worship. . </p>

<p>&quot;He is a truly pious man who worships Trinath, and
blessings are showered on the worshipper. </p>

<p><i>&quot;The </i>worship should be made in a form in which the
rich and the poor may equally join and may perform it easily. </p>

<p><i>&quot;Only </i>three things, each worth one pice, are
required for this <i>puja </i>(form of worship).. </p>

<p>The things which please all must be selected. The offering
should consist of <i>siddhi </i>(ganja),. <i>pan </i>(betel-leaf),
and oil, each worth one pice. . </p>

<p>&quot;The votaries should assemble at night and worship with
flowers. The ganja should be washed in the manner in which people
wash ganja for smoking. The worshipper must fill three <i>chillums
</i>with equal quantities of ganja, observing due awe and
reverence. When all, the worshippers are assembled the lamp
should be lit with three wicks, and the praises of Tri- should be
sung. As long as the wicks burn, the god should be worshipped and
his praises chanted. The god should be reverentially bowed to at
the close of the puja. When the reading of the <i>Panchali </i>is
finished, those that will not show respect to the <i>Prasad (the<br>
</i>offering which has been accepted by the god), i.e., chillum
of ganja, shall be consigned to. </p>

<p>eternal hell, and the sincere worshippers shall go to heaven.
, </p>

<p><i>How the worship spread.--Anauda </i>Kali commenced the puja
with the aid of some ganja smokers in the village of Fattehpur. A
large number of people consume ganja in the Dacca and Mymensingh
districts, and the worship soon became popular. In fact it spread
like wild-fire from one village to another among the
ganja-smokers. Those that were not in the habit of consuming
ganja also followed their example. </p>

<p>The following circumstances assisted the spread of the Worship
: </p>

<p>I.--The puja is open to all classes from Brahmans to Chandals
and to the rich and the poor. Caste does not stand in its way,
and it may be performed almost every day and in all seasons.<br>
</p>

<p>II.--The pup is a <i>Manarik Puja </i>(made in pursuance of a
vow on the fulfillment of the object desired).. People have been
led to believe that Trinath possesses the power of .healing the
sick and fulfilling desires, and .that those who. neglect his
worship meet with disgrace, while those who observe it <i>attain </i>success
in life. There are several stories m the Panchali narrated in
illustration of this statement. It is also popularly believed
that in the house where Trinath is worshipped cold: fever and
headache do not appear. </p>

<p>III.--This is a cheap form of worship. The puja can be
performed <i>by </i>even the poorest, only three pies being
required. </p>

<p>IV.--People of the lowest class can mix with those above them
without distinction of caste or creed on the occasion of these
pujas. </p>

<p>V.--Ganja eau be consumed by all in the name of a god, and the
practice cannot be looked down upon, because it is done under
certain forms and religious ceremonies. It is also popularly
believed that those who mock the worshippers of Trinath shall be
ruined and shall be the victims of misfortune. <br>
</p>

<p>The worship prevails not only among the poor, but also among
the well-to-do. The latter often entertain their friends after
the puja. </p>

<p>Women do not take any active part in the worship, but they
often listen to the reading. of the <i>Panchali.</i> </p>

<p>The worship is more or less general in the following districts
:--(1) Dacca, (2) Mymensingh, (3) Faridpur, (4) Backergunge, (5)
Noakhali, (6) Tippers, (7) Chittagong, (8) Bogra, (9) Sylhet, and
(10) Pabna (SerajgaDj side). .,, </p>

<p>The worship is on the decline. It is almost dying out among
the educated </p>

<p>]Jut among the masses it Still exists. </p>

<p>. I have ascertained the above facts from Dr. Chandra Sekhar
Kali (brother of the originator, Ananda Chandra Kali) and many
other respectable persons, and also from personal inquiries in
the Daces, Chittagong and Rajshahi divisions. <br>
