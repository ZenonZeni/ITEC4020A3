	During the first third of the twentieth century, punch-card machines based on Dr. Herman
Hollerith's electrical tabulatory equipment
were sped up and modified.  New and faster equipment was designed to handle payroll,
accounting,
billing, sales analysis and other areas.<P>
	By World War II, the leap was made into electronic equipment.  ENIAC (Electronic
Numerical
Integrator and Calculator) was developed at the University of Pennsylvania's Moore School of
Electrical
Engineering by J. Presper Eckert and physicist Dr. John W. Mauchly.  They eliminated the need
for
moving parts by adapting electronic circuits and using electronic pulses to flip vacuum tubes
on and off
like switches, with the "on" and "off" states representing zeroes and ones, the roots of
computers'
binary language.  <P>
	New York Life took delivery of its first modern computers in the 1950s - one from RCA and
one from
IBM.
<P>

	Paternal management made everyone feel like a member of a big extended family.  As a
perquisite,
the company acquired two employee vacation properties, located in the rural Bear Mountain
region of
New York State about an hour's drive north of New York City.  Camp Nylic, for male employees
and
their families, offered cabins named after company officers.  Women employees were housed
separately at Elm Valley Farm, twenty-five miles away. The rate charged for full room and
board was $1
a day.  Anyone sent to the camps for convalescence by the medical department got in free.<P>
	One of the most conspicuous results of the company's prudent management was unveiled in
1928 when the company moved into its new Manhattan Home Office at 51 Madison Avenue.  
In 1889, the first Madison Square Garden occupied the site.  New Yorkers  for the next
thirty years
turned to the Garden for championship fights, operatic recitals, six-day bicycle races, horse
shows and
a potpourri of live entertainment.<P>
	The cornerstone of New York Life's new Home Office was laid with appropriate ceremony on
June
17, 1927.  Architect Cass Gilbert, famous at the time for many structures - including the
Woolworth
Building, once New York's tallest and the U.S. Supreme Court Building - had prepared plans to
build "a
Cathedral of Life Insurance," using the Salisbury Cathedral in England as the inspiration. 
In November
1928, the entire office force from 346 Broadway moved into the new quarters, requiring
practically every
piece of moving equipment in the city for all the files and furniture.<P>
	An opening-day speech by New York Life President Darwin P. Kingsley was broadcast
nationwide
over NBC.  President Calvin Coolidge pressed a button in the White House that unfurled the
United
States flag in the lobby of the new building.<P>
	For the life insurance industry, the downward plunge in the thirties was just as
spectacular as the
boom of the twenties.  Yet New York Life, without taking elaborate preventive measures,
preserved the
assets of its policy owners.  With no equities in its portfolio, it was able to exercise
tight control over its
own destiny. Unlike many other life insurers, New York Life's receipts continued to exceed
disbursements.  In 1933, the deepest year of the depression, the company met obligations of
$366
million and still managed to increase assets to over $2 billion.
