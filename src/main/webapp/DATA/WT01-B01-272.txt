	At Learn@Home our philosophy is that everyone learns and teaches at home. Some families do this within a home-based school setting. Others supplement the education that occurs in public or private schools. <B>This Learn@Home site is for all parents and children</B>. It is a resource that all families can use to enhance whatever schooling approach they have chosen. The information found under <B>Using Learn@Home</B> will be useful to all who want to know more about our site, and will help them find the resources they need within its pages.<BR>

<P>	If your family is choosing to pursue more active home education, the information found within <B>Startup Costs </B>and<B> Expectations </B>will be helpful in following that path. <BR>

<B>Using Learn@Home</B><BR>
	Learn@Home is a resource that can be used by parents and children alike. Our <B>Begin at Home</B> section can provide valuable information and guidance for parents who are considering full-time home schooling. There you can find information about the monetary costs of home schooling as well as expectations you should have from students, government, and the community. There are always legal issues to consider, and our <a href="legal1.htm"><B>Legal Issues</B></a><B> </B>section under Begin at home should get you started in the right direction with considerations of who to contact and who gets the paperwork. <BR>

<P>	Our <a href="after.htm"> <B>After Class</B></a> section is mostly for the students. In  <a href="club1.htm"><B>Club Kids</B></a> we have included <a href="club1.htm"><B>TVKids</B></a> and a list of other web sites that are interesting and educational. TVKids is a reference for educational and entertaining programming. As with all of Learn@Home this area will be growing and changing often. Other sections to look for here in the future will be Computer Kids (an array of computer information), and Bookland (suggested readings for various ages). We also plan to place our Homework Help section here. This will be a place where children can communicate with tutors through message boards and receive help on a number of topics. Available right away is  <a href="arcd1.htm"><B>The Arcade</B></a>, our area for online and offline games. <BR>

<P>In  <a href="acad.htm"><B>The Academy</B></a><B> </B>we have located  <B>The Library, The Locker Room, </B>and <B>The Arts. </B> <a href="libr1.htm"><B>The Library</B></a> can provide you with direct links to some of the best online libraries around the world. You may also find sites from time to time here under more specific topics like history or science. <a href="lock1.htm"><B>The Locker Room</B></a> can help your family stay connected to the sports world with information ranging from homeschool sports news (coming soon) to major league reviews. <a href="arts1.htm"><B>The Arts</B></a><B> </B>is your place to delve into art, music, and dance.  Learn@Home is also building an area called Academic Advisor, where students looking toward college can find reviews of colleges and universities and links to college web sites.<BR>

<P><a href="comm.htm"><B>The Community</B></a> is next on our tour. Here are your connections to the many <a href="sass1.htm"><B>State Associations</B></a><B> </B>and <a href="hslda.htm"><B>National Organizations</B></a> which are there to assist your education efforts. We also provide the <a href="open1.htm"><B>Open line</B></a> which contains our <B>Global Connections, </B>the link to worldwide missions, and the<a href="open.htm"> <B>Weekly Voice</B></a>, timely articles on topics that YOU want. The <a href="caln1.htm"><B>Calendar of Events</B></a> can provide valuable information on upcoming conferences or classes. Coming soon to this section will be the Home Based Business area, which will be a resource area for people operating, or considering, businesses out of their home.<BR>

<P>Still under construction are the Teachers Corner and the Supply Closet. With the addition of these we hope to provide more comprehensive help in many areas: reviewing teaching materials, purchasing them online, financial resources, finding help with record keeping and time and household management, and even parent to parent communications.<BR>

<P>Please remember that you can always send us your comments and suggestions by clicking on any of the “feedback” buttons at the bottom of the pages.<BR>

<B>Startup Costs</B><BR>
A thorough consideration of the home school environment would not be complete without attention to the cost of starting. This can vary widely, depending on the ages and needs of the child. Basic supplies include the obvious: paper, pens, and pencils. The cost of a comfortable place to study can also vary with the needs of the child. One may work better at a desk and chair while another learns better with less restrictive surroundings. These costs you will need to determine from your own research.<BR>

<P>One item that many believe to be indispensable is a small to medium size chalk board or dry erase board. Together with an easel to hold it, They could cost $45 to $80. Posters and other educational charts for your school room could add another $10 to $20. <BR>

<P>A comprehensive curriculum that contains all the needed subjects for early grades should cost between $300 and $500 new. It is also helpful to have on hand teachers’ resource books such as those by Cathy Duffy or Mary Pride. Plan to add another $40 to $80 depending on which one is chosen. Some curriculums work well with and require purchase of manipulatives, flash cards, and other supporting materials. The additional cost should be $15 to $50.<BR>

<P>One of the best places to start is your state association's yearly curriculum fair. A list of these events can be found under our <a href="caln1.htm"><B>Calendar of Events</B></a>. Be aware, though, that while their is a vast amount of useful material out there, you cannot use it all. Start small. Talk to other home schooling parents to see what has worked best for them. Read a few of the many good books available from the home school community. Remember that your home school can be uniquely your own, suited to your family.<BR>

<P>Do not forget to include memberships when you add your costs together. Your connection to the Home School Legal Defense Association and state and local support groups is worth everything it costs.  For around $150 you can have a year’s membership in HSLDA and two support groups.<BR>

<P>As you may expect, you can always chose to purchase used curricula and books and supplies at a much lower cost than new. This can be a good way to try several types of home school materials. We will soon be able to provide message boards in the Learn@Home site to help parents communicate needs such as used supplies they have for sale. In addition, our Supply Closet will be growing soon. We will be bringing a variety of home school suppliers to the Internet to provide you with the best of their materials.<BR>

<P>Don’t forget to read the other information found under <B>Begin@Home</B>; and check out our state and national associations under<a href="comm.htm"><B>The Community</B></a>.<BR>

<B>Expectations</B><BR>
If your family is choosing to pursue full-time home education, expectations of everyone involved need to be considered. Not only are you interested in what to expect of your students, they are wondering what to expect of you, the parent/teacher. Other areas of consideration will be home life, government, and the community.<BR>

<P>If your family will be home schooling from the beginning of your children’s school years, the students have very little basis on which to make a comparison. Probably their only exposure to formal schooling will be comments from older playmates who have already done kindergarten or first grade. In this case you can usually expect excitement and enthusiasm on their part. There should be less fear and apprehension of the unknown school room because the school setting and faces will already be familiar to them: your home and your family. If, however, you will be making a transition from public or private school to home school, some children may have questions about the new situation. They may think they will not be able to see their old friends, or that they will be “stuck” at home for weeks on end. Just the opposite is true, of course. Home educated children often enjoy a greater variety of friendships because they are not relegated to spending the majority of their week interacting with only one age group. Their after-school play can be just as rewarding as that of public school children. Because of the additional flexibility involved in home schooling, there will also be numerous opportunities to get out of the home classroom and participate with others in support group activities and field trips, where children will receive more personal attention than in a group of thirty or more in other school settings.<BR>

<P>What can you expect of your home life if your family decides to home-educate? Of course, your schedule will change, but not necessarily for the worst. The teaching parent can expect less free time and more scheduled parts of the day. Home educating, however, does not usually take as much of the day as does public and private schooling. You can expect a little more flexibility in making your schedule because you won’t be coordinating with thirty other families every day. One of the best benefits is more overall family time together. The other parent can expect to be involved more than the public schooling parents, simply because there are more opportunities to do so in home education.<BR>

<P>Government expectations are another area of consideration. Depending on the laws of your state, home schooled children are often held to a much higher standard than their counterparts in the public schools. By and large, home educated children often greatly exceed these standards. The individual attention that these children can receive is a world of difference from the one-size-fits-all approach of the public school system. The government attitude and requirements vary from state to state and even from county to county. Some local school boards are quite helpful while others are a bit suspicious or even discouraging. The best source of information in this area would be the state home education associations and the local support groups. A listing of these can be found in our <a href="comm.htm"><B>Community</B></a><B> </B>pages under <a href="sass1.htm"><B>State Associations</B></a>. The state and local groups for your area can be a valuable resource, and should be some of the first places to contact if your family is considering home education.<BR>

<P>Expectations of and from your community and neighborhood can be varied. In general, people are quite curious about home-educating families. Many expect these children to be better behaved, and it is usually the case. Many will be envious of the quality <I>and </I>quantity time that the home school family enjoys together. Sometimes neighbors will be annoyed because their children want to be taught at home as well. Some will wonder if the children will be socially deprived, unable to communicate outside the home. Just the opposite is the case. Home taught children are frequently quite adept at handling a great variety of social situations because their weeks can be filled with more varied activities than in many public schools. These children routinely interact with a wide age range of people, as opposed to public school children who have only their peer age group in which to learn.<BR>

<P>This discussion is by no means exhaustive. There are several excellent books on the market that can help to clarify all of these expectations. “Home Grown Kids” by Ray and Dorothy Moore is a great place to start. Also, “A Survivor’s Guide to Home Schooling” by Luanne Shackelford and Susan White, can be a valuable resource. These are only two of the numerous books and resources that are available to families considering home education. We hope to include a wide variety of tools such as these in our Supply Closet in the near future.<BR>

<P>Overall, home education can be an exciting experience for everyone involved. Don’t set your expectations too high; parents and children are human. There will be good days and bad days just like in any other family. Set your expectations high enough to look forward to a positive, family-building, and rewarding experience for everyone involved.<BR>
