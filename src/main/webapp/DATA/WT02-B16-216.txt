<p><strong>Manufacturing Technology</strong>
<P>
In 1991, DOE began PV Manufacturing Technology (PVMaT)&#151;a 5-year, $100 million cost-shared initiative&#151;to reduce module costs and boost production capacity. The first 8 companies to receive PVMaT subcontracts reduced module manufacturing costs by 50% or more and are expected to carve another factor of 2 from manufacturing costs by 1997. Participating companies also increased their combined manufacturing capacity from about 12 megawatts (MW) per year to about 35 MW. Three companies successfully introduced new product lines with lower costs and improved performance.
<P>
Further cost reductions are necessary to expand PV markets, so the next 5 years of R&D are vitally important to the industry. We intend to achieve cost reductions by <a href="#reduce">reducing manufacturing costs</a>, <a href="#modify">modifying laboratory techniques for production</a>, <a href="#optimize">optimizing PV products</a>, and <a href="#test">testing product performance</a>. 
<P>
<a name="reduce">Reducing Manufacturing Costs</a>
<P>
Manufacturing costs depend on many factors of production, and research is under way to optimize several of them. An important factor is throughput&#151;the rate at which PV materials or devices are passed through the processes of material deposition, preparation, encapsulation, and connection to electrical components. Examples of measures taken under PVMaT to increase throughput include automating the assembly process, reducing the number of steps in a process, and moving from batch processing to continuous processing.
<P>
Another important cost factor involves material. We are exploring ways to get more from relatively costly materials through thinner device designs and more precise fabrication methods that produce less waste.

<a name="modify">Modifying Laboratory Techniques for Production</a>
<P>
The high-efficiency materials developed in the laboratory must eventually be manufactured in quantity on the production line. Therefore, we develop and test ways to control parameters like temperature and pressure for processes on large batches of material. We also develop alternatives to costly laboratory techniques, which are often not possible to duplicate in a manufacturing environment. And, we explore ways to ensure the manufacturability of promising materials whose composition changes when manufactured in quantity.

<a name="optimize">Optimizing PV Products</a>
<P>
While continuing work on PV processes and materials, PVMaT also addresses refinements of the entire PV product. Manufacturers and systems developers conduct R&D to integrate PV system components for optimal performance, reliability, and lifetime. They simplify systems and select the most durable components. And they work to improve BOS components such as inverters, batteries, and control systems. 
<P>
<a name="test">Testing Product Performance</a>
<P>
Documenting what works and what doesn't is crucial for improving PV products and processes. Typically,
therefore, when a manufacturer produces a new or prototype product, it sends the product to <a href="nrel.html">NREL</a> or <a href="sandia.html">Sandia</a>, where researchers verify the product's performance, document the results, and send the information back to the manufacturer.
