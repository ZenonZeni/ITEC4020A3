<H3>Free fertilizer through grass-cycling</H3>
<B>
<A NAME="island"><P>Everyone enjoys a well-kept lawn for recreation and good looks. In time, however, the monoculture of grass known as a lawn can become boring. As we all know, variety is the spice of life, and that old saying applies to landscape design as much as anything else.</P>
<P>Variety in the landscape has benefits beyond the aesthetic. Mixed plantings attract birds and beneficial insects that prey on pests. Diverse landscapes, which are based on a healthy soil full of organic compost that stimulates earthworms and other helpful little critters, will also function as ecosystems that are less vulnerable to diseases and more self-regulating than a mono- culture. In a stable ecosystem, natural controls prevent problems from getting out of hand, fertilizer needs are reduced and herbicides are unnecessary.</P>
<P>A gardener can promote diversity within a lawn by using a seed mix that includes flowers such as lawn daisies, Roman chamomile, yarrow and clover. Several years of research at Oregon State University have led to the development of such "Eco-Lawns," mixes that stand up to foot traffic, need minimal maintenance and are pleasing to look at.</P>
<P>A gardener could also consider replacing some lawn area with beds along the edge, or with "islands" of desirable flowers, shrubs or trees. Of course, a well-planned and maintained water garden will also attract birds and possibly frogs and toads.</P>
<P>A visit to a quality garden center can reveal the unlimited possibilities for enriching the environment with thoughtful garden design.</P>

<H3>Grass substitutes for problem areas</H3>
<A NAME="subs"><P>Sometimes, despite a gardener's best efforts to improve the soil and care for the grass, their lawn fails to thrive. Insufficient light is often the cause of the problem. Other times the location is too hot or steep to keep well-watered and fertilized. On such sites a gardener is well-advised to consider low-maintenance alternatives to turfgrass.</P>
The following plants are excellent choices for difficult locations.<BR></B>
<B>For shade:</B><BR>
<B>Vinca minor</B>-Best choice for dry soil, has periwinkle blue flowers.<BR>
<B>Pachysandra</B>-Spreads quickly through underground runners but is not invasive;thrives in acid soil.<BR>
<B>Creeping Oregon grape</B>-Yellow flowers and blue berries against holly-like leaves make this Oregon state flower attractive year-round.<BR>
<B>Sword fern</B>-A tough fern that tolerates some sun and looks good through winter.<BR>
<B>Sweet woodruff</B>-A pleasant aroma and profuse white flowers add to this rapid grower's charm.<BR>
<B>Hostas</B>-Lush yet elegant appearance, dozens of varieties and easy care make hostas a popular choice for shade.<BR>
<B>Lily Turf</B>-Ideal for use around ponds and the edge of streams, best with well-drained soil and light feeding.<BR>
<B>Wintergreen</B>-Large scarlet berries really light up dark areas, needs woodland soil conditions.<BR>
<B>Sarccococca humilis</B>-Also known as Himalayan box, it is fragrant in bloom and always a polished dark green.<BR>
<B>For Sun:</B></BR>
<B>Kinnickinnick</B>-Thrives on steep slopes and meager but well-drained soil. Very cold hardy.</BR>
<B>Willowleaf cotoneaster</B>-The most graceful of the cotoneasters, and as tough as any.<BR>
<B>Blue rug juniper</B>-Flattest juniper, intense blue-green color. Must have well-drained soil and full sun. <BR>
<B>Roman Chamomile</B>-Delightful apple-like fragrance, profuse daisy-like flowers; can be mowed to make a sweet-smelling pathway. <BR>
<B>Mother of Thyme</B>-Spicy fragrance, pink flowers, excellent between stepping stones. <BR>
<B>Creeping rosemary</B>-Good over walls and on slopes. Tolerates heat, but not cold.  Hardy to about 18 degrees F. <BR>
<B>Rockrose</B>-Attractive grey-green foliage and long bloom period. A fire-resistant favorite in California, rockrose tolerates salt spray, ocean winds and desert heat. <BR>

<H3>Free fertilizer through grass-cycling</H3>
<B>
<A NAME="free"><P>Grass clippings are the largest source of landscape waste in most yards.  Yet leaving the clippings on the lawn, or grass-cycling, is healthier for the lawn than removing them. Grass-cycling recycles nutrients and reduces fertilizer needs often contributing almost half of the lawns annual nitrogen needs.  Grass cycling also adds organic matter which rejuvenates the soil and helps to conserve moisture, and it saves the time and expense of bags and collection fees.</P>
<P>Many mowers are now designed to chop clippings into tiny pieces and blow them down into the turf.  Inexpensive mulching blades and conversion kits for older mowers are also available to convert older rotary mowers for mulching .  Most real-type and push mowers cut clippings small enough so that they can be left on the lawn.</P>
<P>Grass-cycling with any mower requires more frequent, light mowing, but each mowing takes less time without bagging and disposing of clippings.  The key to successful grass-cycling is to mow often and leave fine clippings on the lawn.</P>
