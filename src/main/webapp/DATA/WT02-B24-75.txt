<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Behavorial Management - AD/HD</h2>
<p>
Students with the characteristics of AD/HD do best in an organized
environment where behavioral expectations are spelled out clearly and in
advance and where consequences are delivered immediately. The main
principle behind the behavioral management system is to decrease the
undesirable behaviors and to increase the desirable behaviors through a
system of rewarding desirable behavior and ignoring undesirable behavior. The
environment needs to be predictable and the management of the behavior
must be consistent. The use of behavioral charts with systems of a token
economy or response cost and the use of time-out work effectively with these
children.
<p>
Some aspects of the use of behavioral management need to be designed
specifically for these students, including the following factors:
<ul>
<li>  Children with AD/HD are efficient learners when their behavior is reinforced
   100% of the time, but are less efficient on a partial reinforcement schedule.
   In the classroom, where the teacher is able to give the student direct
   feedback infrequently, the student with AD/HD who is not always paying
   attention is placed at a disadvantage.
<br><li>
   The timing of the reinforcement is also critical with the child with AD/HD. If
   the feedback is immediate, it is effective. If there is a delay in the timing,
   the student learns less efficiently than his peers.
<br><li>
   It is critical that the reinforcement contingency is clear to the student with
   AD/HD or it will be less effective.
<br><li>
   They work best with a system of positive reinforcement rather than
   punishment. It is important to respond to the behavior of these students
   without anger.
<br><li>
  The use of Cognitive Behavior Modification has successfully assisted these
   students in becoming aware of their own thinking processes and their
   approach to tasks. The approach gives them responsibility for their own
   reinforcement and assists them in learning to organize themselves and to
   control their own behavior.
<br><li>
   The provision of direct instruction in self-control and social skills can be
   helpful.
<br><li>
   Relaxation techniques may be useful and teaching the student to "stop,
   look, and think" and may assist the student in self-monitoring.
<br><li>
   Behavior management should be coordinated across all settings and
   communication between the home and the school is essential. If the student
   has a private therapist or counselor, they should be involved in the planning
   of the management system.
<br><li>
   If the child is on medication, a system to objectively monitor behavioral
   changes should be established and coordinated with the student's
   physician.
