Instructors who teach introductory judicial politics classes or introductory
American politics classes will find much of value in these two paperback
textbooks designed to introduce students to the U. S. Supreme Court. Although
these books from St. Martin's Press cover many of the same topics, there
are several substantial differences between them. Also, they differ in several
respects from competing books released by other publishers.<BR>
<BR>
Both David Barnum and Thomas Walker and Lee Epstein detail the history and
organization of the federal appellate courts, the nature of judicial review,
and the history of the Court. Walker and Epstein are very terse in the discussion
of these topics, and they present data on judicial review through the use
of their favorite illustrative device, the line graph. Barnum offers an
additional discussion of the democratic character of judicial review that
is in keeping with his greater attention to the normative dimensions of
the judicial process, and his description of court organization and jurisdiction,
offered in a separate chapter, and Supreme Court history, offered later
in his book, are much more elaborate. <BR>
<BR>
Walker and Epstein then discuss the selection of the justices, the justices'
background characteristics, and court support personnel. Barnum postpones
the discussion of judicial selection until covering other material and treats
selection as a restraint on Court decision making rather than as a variable
affecting all aspects of the work of the Court. In comparison to Walker
and Epstein, his approach offers somewhat less data on the justices but
adds historical information on the appointment process. Only Walker and
Epstein discuss departures from the bench.<BR>
<BR>
Case selection receives extended treatment from Walker and Epstein. They
discuss trends in the Court's docket, with graphic illustrations, and the
certiorari decision making process with special attention to the influence
of the Solicitor General, interest groups, and ideology upon this process.
Barnum covers the same topics, but his discussion of certiorari voting is
more formal, uses data less effectively to make its point, and is less attentive
to politics and the special role of the Solicitor General. Barnum adds a
boxed comment on the Solicitor General later in the book, but he does not
directly comment on the special role of the Solicitor General in certiorari
decision making.<BR>
<BR>
Both books review the process of Supreme Court action through the announcement
of opinions. In comparison to Barnum, Walker and Epstein offer a neater
summary of the structure of a term of the Court, more information about
opinion assignment, and graphic information about dissenting and concurring
opinions.<BR>
<BR>
The discussion of decision making in orally argued cases in both books proceeds
from the individual level. Both books discuss the attitudinal or ideological
model of judicial voting, but each qualify the strength of the model by
discussing other individual level political variables and legal variables.
To his credit, Barnum also notes the political environment within which
the justices' decision making occurs. However, his discussion often moves
incoherently from a discussion of external restraints as an independent
variable affecting decisions to a treatment of Court decisions as an independent
variable affecting on Congress, president and the public. Only Walker and
Epstein spend time examining collegial pressures on decision making. Their
depiction of external variables affecting decisions concentrates on interest
groups and not on the Congress or president.<BR>

The discussion of the outcome of Court action by Walker and Epstein presents
empirical information on the topic and ideological direction of court decisions,
then it moves on to discuss the impact of decisions. The impact discussion
follows the population model of Charles Johnson and Bradley Canon (1984).
A final chapter cogently discusses whether the Court is a regime supporter
or a more independent policy maker. Barnum presents data about the ideological
direction of Court decisions with his discussion of decision making. He
does not sort out the effect of the Court's decisions on external political
actors very effectively by employing a model like that offered by Johnson
and Canon. In his final chapters he presents the normative arguments for
and against judicial review. His final chapter assesses whether the Court
is a counter-majoritarian institution by examining public opinion data about
several major issues. In contrast, Walker and Epstein offer only a passing
reference to the normative dimensions of appellate justice. Both books have
glossaries of terms, appended data on the justices, and either chapter end
or appended bibliographies for further reading.<BR>
<BR>
A significant difference between these books is Barnum's inclusion of seven
case studies of constitutional decision making. Although very brief and
exclusively about rights and liberties issues, the case studies afford the
student a portrait of the politics of the origins and impact of Supreme
Court decisions. Unfortunately, the studies are much stronger as examples
of how a case arrives at the Court and the construction of opinions in the
case than as examples of the policy impact of the Court. They offer too
little discussion of how a major rights case is only the beginning of a
political struggle, a struggle in which the role of the Court is often minimal.
<BR>
<BR>
The primary competitors of these books are texts by Lawrence Baum (1992)
and Stephen Wasby (1988). Baum covers the same topics in the same order
as Walker and Epstein. His chapter on certiorari decisions is better organized
than either Barnum or Walker and Epstein, and he makes more use of the new
findings of H. W. Perry about certiorari decisions. Baum's discussion of
decision making, featuring an ample presentation of data, is much more reliant
on the attitudinal or ideological model. His chapters on compliance and
impact use a unique policy implementation approach. He spends less time
on the Court and public opinion or legitimacy than does Barnum, and he is
less direct in considering the role of the Court in the political system
than Walker and Epstein. Interestingly, on several occasions Barnum cites
information found in Baum's book. <BR>
<BR>
Because he provides much more historical information and many more examples
of Court procedures and processes, Wasby's book is much longer than the
books of Barnum, Walker and Epstein, and Baum. Also, Wasby provides more
descriptive information and fewer presentations of data about interest group
litigation, federal court administration, and the overall appellate process.
However, all of the additional detail makes his account less concise and
probably more distracting for the introductory student in an era when many
students regard reading as a chore. <BR>
<BR>
Although each instructor must choose her text with consideration of her
pedagogical aims, as a discussion of judicial behavior in the Supreme Court,
this reviewer finds the Walker and Epstein book to be a more logically organized
and stronger summary of existing knowledge. Barnum's is a book for instructors
who want to concentrate on the normative implications of the Court for American
democracy. However, instructors should be forewarned that neither book discusses
at length the vital role of the Court in statutory construction and the
oversight of the administrative process. Barnum especially implies that
the business of the Court is judicial review. Also, neither book points
to the uniqueness and selective impact of the Supreme Court in American
politics by comparing it to the different but important policy roles of
the other levels of the judiciary which order family, debt, accidental injury,
criminal, and other socioeconomic problems. Despite these caveats, both
books have a useful role to play for education in American <BR>
