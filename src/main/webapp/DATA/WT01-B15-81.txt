Both indices are now moving to new highs, no doubt spurred by the positive action in the US markets. My continuing recommendation is to buy World-based international funds from Trimark, Templeton, Saxon or Sceptre.<p>A UN economic report released last week indicated that the world economy is still growing, but a decelerating rate. The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development went on to say that interest rates in Europe need to be lowered to stimulate job growth. According to the U.N., some Western European countries' unemployment rates were at levels not seen since the Great Depression and were at risk of getting worse. In contrast, the US has experienced one of the longest economic recoveries in postwar history. The strong economic growth of the Asian "Four Tigers"-Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore-should continue. For the past three decades these countries have averaged seven percent annual growth rate.<p>EUROPE. The Morgan Stanley Europe Index continues to move to new highs, after a little weakness over the summer. This action translates very well for the Euro-based international funds, which rank as four of the best ten International Best Funds based upon one year performance. At the moment, Europe represents one of the strongest investable regions in the World. Check out the Best Funds list for good European funds ranked by one year performance.<p>ASIA. It's still a resounding "NO" to a Japanese investment. As before, The Nikkei needs to get above 22,800 to demonstrate to investors that all the current selling pressure, that readily available supply of Japanese securities, has finally dried up. The Hong Kong and Singapore markets are starting to show some signs of life and have been rallying for the past few weeks. <p>LATIN AMERICA. The Latin markets are still operating in neutral. Some of my favourite funds are slightly higher, some slightly lower. The Mexican Bolsa is also in a neutral phase. If you are in, then hold for yet another month. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/europe.gif">Europe<p></a><a href="charts/morgstan.gif">E.
