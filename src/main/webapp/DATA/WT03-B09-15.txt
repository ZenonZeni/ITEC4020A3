Komatsu residents file suit demanding halt to fighter flights+

KANAZAWA, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Residents around the Komatsu base of the Air Self-Defense Force
(ASDF) filed a suit Monday against the state demanding a halt to
fighter flights and compensation for distress caused by aircraft
noise.
     This is the third suit filed by residents of Komatsu, Ishikawa
Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast, demanding halt to flights to
military aircraft.
     In the suit lodged with the Kanazawa District Court, the 1,653
plaintiffs call for a halt to flights of both ASDF and U.S. military
aircraft between noon and 2 p.m. and between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m.
     They also demand 1.2 million yen for each of the plaintiffs for
the past distress caused by noise and 50,000 yen per month for future
distress.
     The plaintiffs say the Self-Defense Forces is unconstitutional.
     They also cited two incidents as illustrating dangers from the
base.  In October an F-15 fighter burst into flames after failing to
take off, and in November an F-15 fighter fired a missile which hit
and downed another F-15 while the two fighters were engaged in a
drill over the Sea of Japan.
     In December last year the Kanazawa branch of the Nagoya High
Court ordered the state to pay 180 million yen compensation to 213
residents out of 330 plaintiffs from Komatsu but rejected the
plaintiffs' pleas filed by 1975 and 1983 for a halt to flights and
compensation for future distress caused by noise.
     Neither the plaintiffs nor the government appealed the ruling.

Metropolitan panel calls for 'realistic' project review+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A panel advising Tokyo Gov. Yukio Aoshima recommended Monday
that a ''realistic review'' be conducted of the Tokyo metropolitan
government's waterfront development project.
     In a report submitted to Aoshima, the panel said the project is
already well under way, with a huge amount of money invested for
construction of a 63,000-population ''city'' in the area surrounding
the Tokyo Bay.
     The report also called for measures aimed at advancing
internationalization, more effective disaster handling, solving
various urban problems and deregulation of business activities.
     During the seven meetings since September, the panel was split
between members calling for a sweeping review of the project and
those arguing for maintaining it, panel members said.
     The panel was established as a private advisory group by
Aoshima, who pledged a review of the project in his election campaign.
     Aoshima has reassured executives of companies planning to invest
in the waterfront development project, saying he plans to continue
the project.
     Aoshima dismayed some business concerns when he canceled an
international city expo that was set to open next spring, a pledge he
had made during his election campaign.

Clinton likely to visit Japan April 16-18+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     U.S. President Bill Clinton is likely to make a three-day state
visit to Japan on April 16-18, rescheduling one that was canceled in
November, the top government spokesman said Monday.
     ''We will officially announce the schedule tomorrow afternoon,''
Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press conference, adding
that the Japanese and U.S. governments are close to agreeing on the
schedule.
     Besides meeting Emperor Akihito, Clinton will hold talks with
Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama and they will issue a joint
statement on the bilateral security system.  He also hopes to talk
directly to the Japanese public to stress the importance of the
security arrangements, Nosaka said.
     The joint statement is expected to include mention of the two
governments' efforts to reduce U.S. bases in Okinawa, following the
rape of a local schoolgirl in September, for which three U.S.
servicemen are on trial.
     Clinton was scheduled to visit Japan in November to attend the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum gathering in Osaka, western
Japan, and for a summit meeting with Murayama but postponed the visit
because of a federal budget crisis.
     The United States previously hoped to reschedule the visit for
early January, but Japan has declined the proposal because of the
emperor's tight schedule.  In February and March, Clinton will be
busy with presidential primaries.
     There still is a possibility that the April visit could be
changed because Clinton plans to attend a Moscow summit meeting on
nuclear safety in late April, government sources said.

SDP member resigns as head of policy research panel+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) resigned Monday
as chief of the party's policy research panel in protest over an
earlier decision by the SDP's policy-making Central Executive
Committee to postpone disbanding the party and forming a new party
as originally set for Jan. 19.
     Nobuyuki Sekiyama, chairman of the SDP Policy Board, handed in
his resignation to SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, an advocate of
a scheme to change the SDP into a new ''liberal'' party with a better
chance of winning coming elections.
     Sekiyama is the second SDP member to quit a key party post in
protest over the Central Executive Committee's decision earlier this
month.
     SDP members are at odds over when to form such a new party, with
Prime Minister and SDP head Tomiichi Murayama cautious about setting
up such a party early but Kubo willing to see the SDP make the change.
     Kubo and his followers have failed in several attempts to build
a new party around the SDP out of concern over the party's sinking
profile in a political landscape dominated by the Liberal Democratic
Party, the biggest group in the tripartite ruling coalition, and the
main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party).
     Kubo himself has suggested he may step down as the party's No. 2
man at a party convention set for Jan. 19.

Okinawa mayor to refuse signing land-lease contract+

NAHA, Japan, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Okinawa Mayor Shusei Arakawa said Monday he will refuse to sign
a contract for renewal of leasing the municipality's land to the
U.S. military.
     The mayor told the city assembly that he will not agree to the
renewal of the lease of the land for use as an ammunition dump in
view of public opinion calling for scaling down of the U.S. military
bases in the prefecture.
     Okinawa will be the second city in Okinawa Prefecture to refuse
to renew a lease of municipal land to the U.S. military, following
the capital city Naha, which has decided not to renew a lease for a
naval facility.
     The city of Okinawa has to begin legal proceedings as early as
1997 for the renewal of the land lease, the contract for which
officially expires in 2000.
     The city owns 474 hectares of land which accounts for about
one-sixth of the Kadena ammunition depot of the U.S. forces.
     The city concluded the present lease contract before Arakawa
was elected mayor in 1991.

AIDS: no finished problem in Japan+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     A Health and Welfare Ministry official was recently quite
puzzled when she was asked a question, ''Is the AIDS problem in
Japan over now?''
     ''The questioner said, 'I haven't seen any AIDS-related stories
in newspapers or magazines recently,'' said Tamami Umeda, deputy
director of the ministry's AIDS, TB and Infectious Diseases Control
Division.
     Of course, the issue is not over.  According to the latest
announcement by the ministry's AIDS Surveillance Committee, 85 new
people with HIV and AIDS were reported in September and October in
Japan, bringing the official total to 4,003.
     The 85 cases comprised 60 Japanese and 25 foreigners.  The 60
Japanese cases were the largest number ever for a two-month period,
the committee said.
     The record, which would have made banner headlines a few years
ago, was almost invisible in the domestic newspapers.
     The only prominent news reports about the disease this year were
those about people, mostly hemophiliacs, who were infected with HIV
after being treated with contaminated blood-clotting agents.
     Of some 4,500 hemophiliacs in Japan, an estimated 2,000 have
contracted the virus in the 1980s from HIV-contaminated blood
products imported mainly from the United States.
     Public calls for redress for those infected people have mounted
after the Tokyo and Osaka District courts in October proposed a
solution to suits filed by HIV-infected hemophiliacs, asking the
state and five pharmaceutical companies to compensate the plaintiffs.
     Umeda, while admitting the grave nature of the issue, criticizes
the media for being ''badly balanced'' in reporting on AIDS.
     ''The media focus on HIV infections caused by blood products is
increasing the number of people who do not think of AIDS as their own
problem,'' she said.
     ''Not many people are aware of the simple fact that anyone can
catch the virus through sexual contact,'' she added.
     Marii Goto, secretary general of the Japan HIV Center, a
nonprofit private group supporting AIDS patients, is also concerned
about growing public apathy.
     Since 1990, the group has been organizing the annual ''36 Hours
AIDS Hotline'' campaign around the Dec. 1 World AIDS Day, in which
volunteers throughout the nation offer information and counseling by
telephone.
     She said ''the telephones never stopped ringing'' during the
events in the first three years, with the 181 calls in 1990,
increasing to 1,771 in 1991 and further rising to 3,100 in 1992.
     However, to the volunteers' disappointment, the responses have
kept decreasing since 1993 to some 1,100 calls this year, Goto said.
     A government survey on the number of people who have visited
public health centers for HIV tests forms a similar curve -- peaking
in 1992.
     Goto said although less people are coming forward to undergo the
tests, the percentage of those tested who were found HIV positive
keeps increasing, indicating that the virus is spreading certainly in
Japan.
     Umeda said Japan may be in the stage of seeing HIV spreading
slowly, but steadly, a symptom which in the experience of many
countries was the precursor of a sudden surge.
     Goto said out of all the problems related with AIDS, she is most
anxious about the public becoming indifferent to the disease.
     ''I believe the antonym of love is not hatred, but disregard.
People who discriminate against AIDS patients can change their
thinking,'' she said.
     In explaining the transition of the public's attitude toward
AIDS, Goto said, ''First there was fear, which aroused interest.  The
level of interest peaked in 1992 when several foreign celebrities
like Magic Johnson announced they were infected, because Japanese
people love to keep up with foreign news.''
     But at the same time, the Japanese are the owners of transient
enthusiasm, and their interest in AIDS has faded, she said.
     ''Some people say the recurrence of fear, by telling how
horrible the disease is, would create public interest again.  But
such a method would only promote discrimination,'' she said.
     Goto believes that providing information on AIDS constantly is
the only solution, which is very dependent on the media and
administration.
     Umeda said the government expects private support groups to
reach out to certain communities in need of information about the
disease, such as gay people and foreigners.
     ''Our words would not influence them easily because they would
be guarded toward us,'' she said, adding the government hopes to help
private groups create a network among them by creating situations in
which they can exchange information.

Gov't adopts administrative reform program+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's cabinet Monday adopted a
program on administrative reform that calls for scrapping or merging
seven public corporations by the end of March 1997.
     The seven concerns include Livestock Industry Promotion Corp.
and the Japan Raw Silk and Sugar Price Stabilization Agency, both
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries.
     The program comes in line with a pledge made by Murayama to
streamline public corporations as part of administrative reform, a
policy target given priority by Murayama.
     The program also sets an April 1, 1997 deadline for the
government to abolish the salt monopoly under Japan Tobacco Corp. and
privatize a mutual fund for compensation of job-related injuries for
firefighters.
     It also stipulates that the cabinet's functions be strengthened
with the introduction of up to three advisers to the prime minister
so that the premier can receive vital information more quickly.
     The program requires the government to take into account
proposals by the Administrative Reform Committee, a government
advisory body, in reviewing the current deregulation program by the
end of next March.
     Among other policy targets, the program calls for reducing the
number of public servants even after the current retrenchment program
expires at the end of March 1998.
     It also points to the need to streamline the postal service,
state forest business and national hospitals.

Gov't approves defense personnel shifts+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The government defense council on Monday adopted minor
personnel shifts from the Self-Defense Forces to the Joint Staff
Council in fiscal 1996, beginning April 1.
     The Security Council of Japan, headed by Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama, decided to cut the number of staff members of the Ground
Self-Defense Force (GSDF) by 570, the Maritime Self-Defense Force
(MSDF) by 333, the Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) by 349, and to
increase the Joint Staff Council staff by 1,202.
     The set number of members for the GSDF is 180,000, 46,085 for
the MSDF and 47,556 for the ASDF, but their actual numbers currently
fall short of the fixed figures.
     The council also endorsed equipment procurement plans under the
government plan for the fiscal 1996 budget, including 11 F-2 fighter
support planes and four F-15 fighter-interceptor planes.

Japan disappointed at French objection to its CE status+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     France's opposition to Japan's bid for observer status on the
Council of Europe (CE) is ''regrettable,'' Vice Foreign Minister
Sadayuki Hayashi said Monday.
     The Foreign Ministry's top bureaucrat made the remark at a news
conference, replying to a question about Japan's failure earlier this
month to acquire the status due to the French objection.
     Hayashi said Tokyo will ask Paris the reason for its opposition
and continue to seek to participate in the council's activities as an
observer.
     He brushed aside speculation that France's opposition was due to
Japan's criticism of French nuclear tests.
     The 38-member council, founded in 1949, aims to achieve a
greater unity among its members, to facilitate their economic and
social progress and to uphold the principles of parliamentary
democracy and respect for human rights.

Princess Chichibu's memoirs to be published in English+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     The English translation of the memoirs of the late Princess
Chichibu, widow of Prince Chichibu and an aunt of Emperor Akihito,
will soon go on sale in Britain and the United States.
     It is the first time that memoirs of a member of the Imperial
Family have been translated into English for sale abroad.  The 1991
book, originally titled ''the silver bonbonniere'' will be called
''Silver Drum'' in English and published by the British publishing
house Global Oriental.
     The princess, whose given name was Setsuko, died in August at
age 85 of complications resulting from chronic heart disease.
     An acquaintance who knew her from her work as honorary president
of the Japan-Britain Society said, ''(Unfortunately) the translation
did not come out while she was still alive, but I think she would
have been delighted.''
     In the book the princess, who was born in London as the daughter
of a Japanese diplomat, describes her life with Prince Chichibu, whom
she married in 1928.  The prince, younger brother of the late Emperor
Showa, contracted tuberculosis in 1940 and died of the disease in
1953 at the age of 50.
     She also provided some detail about the realities of life as a
member of Japanese royalty.  British author Dorothy Briton, who lives
in Hayama, Kanagawa Prefecture, translated the memoirs upon
initiative by the son of Prince Mikasa, a cousin of the Emperor.
     Briton said she consulted the princess, who was fluent in
English, on the manuscript when about one third of the English
version had been completed.  She said the translation is a loose one
aimed at deepening understanding of Japan.
     Just four days before her death the princess was shown the cover
picture for her English-language memoirs.
     The first copy of the book was sent over from Britain at the end
of November and was put in front of the princess' mortuary tablet.
Briton said the book shows how Prince Chichibu's love helped turn her
arranged marriage into a fairy-tale love story.

Murayama aims to discuss Okinawa with Clinton+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said Monday he will discuss
requests from the southernmost Japanese prefecture of Okinawa to
reduce the number of local U.S. bases with U.S. President Bill
Clinton when he visits Japan in April.
     Murayama told reporters, ''We will discuss the adjustment and
reduction of bases giving due thought to the feelings of the people
of Okinawa.''
     ''We will discuss Japan-U.S. bilateral issues well, and the
Okinawa issue in particular.  It is important for us to speak
candidly with each other,'' he said.
     Tokyo and Washington are close to agreeing to reschedule
Clinton's state visit to April 16-18, following the cancellation of a
visit in November.
     The rape of a local schoolgirl in Okinawa in September, for
which three U.S. servicemen are currently on trial, stirred the local
Japanese populace to demand reductions in the large number of U.S.
bases which are concentrated there.

Kono lauds Japan's U.N. 'achievements' in '95+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said Tuesday Japan largely
succeeded in showing an active stance at the United Nations in 1995
on global peace and socioeconomic development.
     ''We made some achievements as far as our U.N. diplomacy is
concerned,'' he told a news conference in looking back on the past
year.
     As its major victory in the 185-member world body, Kono singled
out adoption of peace- and disarmament-related U.N. resolutions that
Japan proposed along with other countries, including a resolution
calling for an immediate halt to nuclear testing.
     ''I can safely say Japan is now in a position to take the
initiative in promoting disarmament, peace, nuclear nonproliferation
and stemming nuclear testing,'' he said.
     The foreign minister also said Japan played an active role in
the field of economic and social development in the past year, which
marks the 50th anniversary of the U.N.'s founding.
     Kono expressed disappointment, however, at a slower pace in U.N.
reform efforts.  He also said Tokyo will have to set a new strategy
for its U.N. diplomacy for 1996.

Murayama to meet Clinton, Yeltsin in April++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama will meet with U.S. President
Bill Clinton in Tokyo in April and is expected to confer with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow immediately thereafter,
the government said Tuesday.
     Clinton will make a three-day state visit to Japan on April
16-18 in place of one canceled in November, a top government
spokesman said.
     The Japanese and U.S. governments have officially agreed on the
schedule, with Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and Secretary of State
Warren Christopher discussing it over the phone, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press conference.
     Clinton will meet Murayama on April 17 and the two leaders will
issue a joint statement reconfirming the Japan-U.S. security
alliance, Nosaka said.
     The statement is expected to give a fresh significance to the
security system, while mentioning efforts to respond to wishes from
the southernmost Japanese prefecture of Okinawa to reduce the
concentration of U.S. bases there.
     Okinawa has stepped up demands for local base cutbacks following
the rape of an Okinawa schoolgirl in September, for which three U.S.
servicemen are currently on trial.
     The president also hopes to speak directly to the Japanese
public on the importance of the bilateral security arrangements,
according to government sources.
     Despite an international summit on nuclear safety set for April
19-20 in Moscow, the schedule of Clinton's visit will not be changed,
Nosaka said, adding that Japan and the United States have arranged it
very carefully.
     Murayama will attend the Moscow summit and a meeting with
Russian President Yeltsin is likely to take place, he said.
     Clinton originally planned to visit Japan in November to attend
a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in
Osaka, western Japan, and stay on for the state visit but postponed
the trip amid a federal budget crisis.
     The U.S. side previously hoped to reschedule the visit for early
January, but Japan declined the proposal because of the tight New
Year schedule of Emperor Akihito, with whom Clinton is to meet as a
state guest.
     In February and March, Clinton will be busy with presidential
primaries.

Hiroshima, Nagasaki to send A-bomb expo to U.S., France+

HIROSHIMA, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only cities ever hit by an atomic
bomb, announced plans Tuesday to send an exhibition around the world
on a three-year mission to promote an end to nuclear weapons,
starting in the United States and France next year.
     City officials said they plan to stage the exposition for about
two weeks in the two cities a year over the coming three years.
     The two cities will send photographs and atomic bombing
artifacts for the first exposition in U.S. and French cities next
year, adding they want people to know the actual situation of
atom-bomb victims.
     The sites will be determined with the cooperation of 410 members
of the World Conference of Mayors for Peace Through Inter-City
Solidarity, an antinuclear group formed and headed by Hiroshima Mayor
Takashi Hiraoka.
     The mayor, through the cooperation of the two cities, took part
in an exhibition held at a university in Washington in July.
     In October, Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito visited France to protest
over the series of nuclear tests planned by Paris in the South
Pacific, the first of which was carried out in September.
     Both mayors expressed the feeling that there is a difference in
awareness concerning nuclear weapons between the citizens of the two
atom-bombed cities and nations that possess nuclear arms.
     They decided to organize the exhibition in order to inform more
people of the terrors of nuclear weapons, hoping this will eventually
lead to their elimination in the future.
     ''We are currently planning to hold this exhibition for three
years, but we would like to continue until nuclear weapons are
eliminated,'' said Hiraoka.
     Last week the mayors called on Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
to make the holding of the exposition in various countries a national
project.
     They asked that the state cover the costs associated with
providing photographs and other materials about the 1945 atomic
bombings of the cities to other countries.

MOF releases transparent, stricter auditing measures++

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura announced Tuesday a set of
measures to help Japanese banks strengthen their risk management,
auditing and checking systems as a way to prevent illicit financial
operations like the Daiwa Bank scandal.
     ''It is necessary for Japan to make a drastic shift in its
financial policy,'' Takemura said at a news conference, acknowledging
the Finance Ministry's failure in the past to adequately check
expanding bank operations after the onset of the ''bubble'' economy
in the late 1980s.
     To try to remedy the situation, he said the ministry will make
sure that two key principles will be established in Japan's banking
system -- self-responsibility of the sector and transparent financial
policy based on market mechanisms.
     Specifically, Takemura said, the ministry will introduce an
early warning system meant to detect irregularities in the banking
sector, such as the use of objective criteria for ordering business
improvements at faltering financial institutions.
     Banks with their capital-to-asset ratio below certain levels,
for example, would be ordered to rectify the situation under the
warning system, Takemura said.
     As a means to accurately assess the capital ratio and other
financial standings of certain banks, the new system will require
banks to entrust outside accountants with the auditing of their
financial records, Takemura said.
     The package also features expanding financial inspectors within
the ministry by 66 from some 400 people at present, Takemura said,
citing a larger scale of about 8,000 at U.S. financial authorities.
     The Daiwa scandal, which involved the cover-up of 1.1 billion
dollars in U.S. Treasury securities trading over 11 years from 1984,
undermined Japan's financial sector already battered by a series of
financial failures this year.
     Reflecting global concern over Japan's banking system, Japanese
banks have been slapped with the so-called ''Japan premium,'' or an
extra interest rate on their fund raising overseas.
     Takemura said the Finance Ministry's slowness in shifting its
policy from regulation-oriented protectionism to a policy based on
market forces has been partly responsible for the current lack of
self-responsibility at Japan's financial institutions.
     The recent series of financial failures and the Daiwa Bank
scandal stemmed from the banking sector's inadequate risk management
as they mistakenly perceived the extraordinary financial expansion of
the bubble economy as sound financial development, Takemura said.
     The Finance Ministry was looking the other way while the
situation was deteriorating, Takemura said, confirming the ministry's
role in the current problem with the banking system.
     Takemura also admitted that relations between the ministry and
the financial sector could be seen as ''nontransparent'' as its
instructions on key policies were not explained to the public.
     ''The early warning system and the outside auditing under the
new package will ensure objectivity in banking inspections and
increase a certain level of distance between authorities and
financial institutions,'' Takemura said.
     Takemura said the Finance Ministry promises immediate reporting
to local financial authorities in the case of new overseas scandals
involving Japanese financial institutions.
     ''The package will fundamentally change Japan's financial
policy,'' Takemura said.
     The introduction of the early warning system means that any bank
operating ineffectively would go under as a natural consequence of
the market mechanism, ministry officials said, in briefing reporters
on the package.
     ''The package is absolutely indispensable for Japan's financial
system.  The Japan premium will not be abolished unless Japanese
financial institutions correct their attitude,'' a senior ministry
official said.
     The package pushes financial institutions to improve their
internal inspection systems from fiscal 1996 starting next April, as
a lesson learned from the Daiwa scandal, the ministry officials said.
     To this end, the ministry will draw up a set of guidelines on
soundness of assets, operation in compliance with related laws and
regulations, risk management of market trading, including derivatives
deals, and computer system management, they said.
     The package also asks financial institutions to have outside
experts inspect their overseas operations, as well as to employ
internal auditors and compliance officers at their overseas branches,
who are to be independent from branch managers and report directly to
headquarters.
     As part of measures to secure sound banking operations,
financial institutions are also requested to give longer vacations of
some two weeks to employees.
     The Finance Ministry will translate data from internal
inspections by banks into credit ratings that show the soundness of
their capital and other financial conditions, the officials said.
     Banks with lower credit ratings will face closer scrutiny by the
ministry on their overall risk management, they said.
     With an eye to ways to prevent the recurrence of incidents such
as the Daiwa scandal, the ministry will increase the number of
overseas inspections, the officials said.
     For that purpose, the ministry will form a team specialized in
overseas examinations, the officials said, noting that some
inspectors will be stationed abroad.
     The Finance Ministry will keep in touch with its overseas
counterparts and share information on a regular basis, the officials
said.
     The range of mandatory reporting of financial accidents and
irregularities to authorities will expand to cover subsidiaries with
an equity holding by a parent firm of more than 50%, the ministry
officials said.
     Takemura said he hopes the fresh package will help lift
auditing and inspection levels in the Japanese banking sector to U.S.
levels in the near future.
     He said bills to revise relevant laws for the package will be
presented to the ordinary Diet session to be convened in January next
year.
     He added that steps that do not require any legal revision will
be implemented immediately.

100 new plaintiffs join HIV-hemophiliac suit in Tokyo+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Another 100 hemophiliacs who contracted HIV from contaminated
imported blood products joined a large-scale compensation suit
Tuesday against the state and five pharmaceutical makers that
marketed the products.
     The new group, which brings the total number of plaintiffs to
218, demands a total of 11.3 billion yen in compensation, swelling
the overall damages sought to 24.7 billion yen in the suit, pending
at the Tokyo District Court.
     The move comes after the Tokyo and Osaka District courts in
October proposed a solution to suits filed by HIV-infected
hemophiliacs, asking the state and five pharmaceutical makers to
compensate the plaintiffs.
     Some 1,800 people across Japan, almost all of them hemophiliacs,
have contracted the AIDS-inducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
from contaminated imported blood products.
     According to the plaintiffs' lawyers, more victims are
considering joining the suit in the wake of the proposed out-of-court
settlement.
     The latest plaintiffs group, the eighth, includes people from
five prefectures not previously represented in the suit -- Aomori,
Gifu, Mie, Tokushima and Kumamoto.
     The number includes a woman who contracted the virus when she
accidentally pricked herself with a syringe needle while
administering an injection to her hemophiliac HIV-infected child.
     Both courts are currently negotiating with the plaintiffs and
the defendants in an effort to reach an out-of-court settlement by
next spring.  The most recent plaintiff group would be covered by
such a settlement.
     In a first proposal the pharmaceutical makers have offered to
compensate each plaintiff with 45 million yen for the time being.
The courts are, however, expected to come up with a second proposal
mapping out a final settlement of the matter.

Agency warns of rising sentiment against U.S. military+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The Public Security Investigation Agency predicted Tuesday that
the domestic movement against the U.S. military presence in Japan
and the U.S.-Japan security alliance will grow stronger in 1996, and
did not rule out illegal acts.
     ''Political extremists and the Japanese Communist Party are
expected to continue to try to fan the struggle against the U.S.
(military presence) and the bilateral security treaty,'' the agency
said in its outlook on domestic and international security risks.
     It warned that extremists could stage attacks particularly in
protest at the forced lease of private land to U.S. bases in Okinawa
Prefecture.
     Calls for a reduction of the heavy U.S. presence in the
prefecture have grown louder since the Sept. 4 rape of an Okinawan
schoolgirl, for which three U.S. servicemen are on trial.
     The report says that the religious cult AUM Shinrikyo emerged
this year as the perpetrator of an unprecedented series of crimes
such as the March 20 sarin attack on Tokyo subways.
     The agency launched measures toward dissolving the cult based on
the Antisubversive Activities Law because ''there is an evident
danger that the cult will engage in similar activities in the
future,'' the report said.
     Noting that ultranationalist extremists staged three guerrilla
attacks in 1995, which abounded with World War II commemorations, the
agency cites concerns that such activities might become more
pronounced depending on government and opposition politicians' views
on the nation's war guilt.
     As for the situation abroad, the report says North Korea has as
yet apparently refrained from officially naming a new head of state
following the death in July 1994 of President Kim Il Sung so as to
make use of the late leader's charisma, as the nation is faced with
natural disasters and international scrutiny over its nuclear program.
     It also said that the North's de facto leader, Kim Jong Il,
might hide behind the power of his late father, who wielded strong
influence over the military, to ensure the continuity of the
country's system.
     In China, a September reshuffle in the Communist Party's Central
Committee has strengthened President Jiang Zemin's camp, the report
said, while warning that domestic trouble first of all on the
economic front could unleash another struggle about the nation's
direction.

Shinshinto's new head likely to be chosen Wed.+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Ballot counting will begin Wednesday morning for the
presidential election of the main opposition Shinshinto (New
Frontier Party), with observers seeing the party's Secretary General
Ichiro Ozawa leading his rival Tsutomu Hata.
     If the counting go smoothly, the winner will be known within the
day and the new president will officially assume office at a general
assembly of the party's Diet members Thursday.
     Both declaring that, if elected, they would aim to wrest power
from the ruling coalition, Ozawa, 53, and Hata, 60, have run the
two-horse race since Dec. 16.
     Ending the campaign, Ozawa told reporters, ''I am pleased that
the party could discuss policy issues'' during the campaign.  Hata, a
former prime minister, said, ''I feel confident of victory.''
     By Tuesday, when postal voting ended, some 1.68 million votes
had been cast -- 220,000 by party members and associated members plus
some 1.46 million by other Japanese citizens aged 18 or older who
paid 1,000 yen each to vote.
     Ozawa's camp has expressed confidence of winning a majority by
securing at least one million votes, while Hata's camp predicts votes
ranging from 600,000 to 900,000 have already been obtained.
     According to a survey conducted by Kyodo News Service on
Shinshinto's senior local chapter members, Ozawa led Hata, but there
is uncertainty about how ordinary Japanese citizens have voted.
     Ozawa and Hata, though long-time allies, are seeking the
presidency after the first president, Toshiki Kaifu, decided not
to seek reelection, having thrown his weight behind Ozawa.
     Ozawa was instrumental in creating Shinshinto a year ago through
a merger of all the main opposition forces, excluding the Japanese
Communist Party.  Hata briefly served as prime minister while serving
as the head of one of Shinshinto's predecessor parties.

Member of SDP left-wing runs for party leadership+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     A leading member of the Social Democratic Party's staunch
left-wing said Tuesday that he will run for the party leadership
next month when Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's term as party
chairman expires.
     Tadatoshi Akiba, a House of Representatives member from
Hiroshima, telephoned Murayama of his decision to run for the
chairmanship in an intraparty election scheduled for Jan. 14-15.
     The outcome of the poll is to be announced Jan. 16 and a new SDP
leadership selected at an annual party convention set for Jan. 19.
Applications for candidacy will be accepted Jan. 5.
     Murayama, 71, has suggested he will run for another term as the
party's leader and different quarters in the SDP have been floating
different names as potential opponents.
     Akiba, 53, has been a member of an SDP group opposed to policy
changes within the party and to the formation of a new liberal party
sought by a right-of-center group led by the party's No. 2 man,
Secretary General Wataru Kubo.
     Akiba's group opposes the dispatch of Self-Defense Forces troops
to the Golan Heights in the Middle East on a U.N. peacekeeping
mission and is against any increases in Japanese military might.
     The group, the Roundtable to Guard the Constitution, went so far
as to hold its own celebrations in November to mark the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the socialist party.
     Eligible to vote in the January election are some 110,000 SDP
members and supporters who have been cooperating with the party for
more than a year.
     The SDP is a partner in the tripartite ruling coalition that
also includes the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New Party
Sakigake, an LDP splinter group.

Local political funds hit 160 bil. yen+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Political parties and fund-raising organizations collected a
total of 159.5 billion yen in local political funds in 1994,
according to a count by Kyodo News Service from reports to
prefectural election administration committees.
     The amount was larger, for the first time ever, than the total
of political funds collected in Tokyo and reported to the Home
Affairs Ministry, which was 148.4 billion yen.
     In total, the political funds collected in 1994 amounted to
307.9 billion yen, down 6.8% from the previous year, for the
third consecutive year-on-year decline since peaking at 359.1 billion
yen in 1991.
     Local fund-raising parties with proceeds of 10 million yen or
more numbered 225, for total funds of 7.7 billion yen, marking a
2.9-fold jump.
     The Japanese Communist Party topped the list of the fund raisers
in the prefectures, with 29.2 billion yen, followed by the Liberal
Democratic Party with 14.9 billion yen, and the Social Democratic
Party with 6.6 billion yen.

Dailies cautiously welcome new Shinshinto chief Ozawa+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Major Japanese dailies gave a cautious welcome in their
editorials Thursday to the election of Ichiro Ozawa as president of
the main opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party).
     ''Although there are various concerns, it is a good thing that
Mr. Ozawa has emerged as the starring figure at center stage from
backstage,'' the Asahi Shimbun said, referring to Ozawa's role as the
party's backstage power broker.
     ''It can at least be appreciated that Ozawa has tried to meet a
request for creating (two) opposing axes over ideology and policy,''
the Asahi said, in reference to Ozawa's claim that the Japanese
political system should become one dominated by two major political
parties.
     ''What the Japanese people should welcome is that 'the Ozawa
method' will be easier to be seen on the surface,'' the Mainichi
Shimbun said in reference to Ozawa's behind-the-scene political
maneuvering.
     ''Mr. Ozawa has never stood in the Diet for questioning as party
chief and for questioning before (the House of Representatives)
budget committee...Since he became secretary general of Shinshinto,
he has noticeably acted in secret as he has often been absent (at
party meetings)...This has provided an excuse for criticism of a dual
power structure (in Shinshinto), but it cannot be tolerated in a
party chief,'' the Mainichi said.
     The Yomiuri Shimbun said, ''With the election of Ozawa, said to
have been the party's backstage power broker, we expect Shinshinto's
'dual power structure' to end and the transparency in party
management to increase.''
     ''We also hope he delivers the 'easy-to-understand politics and
powerful execution' that he has been campaigning for.  Many of those
who voted for him must think the same way,'' the Yomiuri said.
     On Wednesday, Ozawa scored an overwhelming victory over his
long-time political ally, former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, to
become the head of Shishinto.

Murayama's new year visit to shrine OK, gov't says+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The government sees no problem in Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama paying a visit to Ise Shrine in Mie Prefecture in western
Japan on Jan. 4, a top government spokesman said Thursday.
     ''There are various arguments against visiting Yasukuni Shrine,
but prime ministers' visits to Ise have already become a customary
annual event,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka told a press
conference.
     Answering questions about whether Murayama's Ise visit does not
violate the constitutional principle of separation of state and
religion, Nosaka said Murayama's Social Democratic Party has also
discussed the problem and agreed to sanction the visit.
     During the 38-year period to 1993 of single-party rule under the
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), LDP premiers made it a rule to pay a
New Year visit to Ise.
     Ise Shrine enshrines the goddess Amaterasu, the legendary
ancestor of the imperial family, while Yasukuni Shrine enshrines the
Japanese military war dead.
     Murayama, who came to power in June last year, did not go to Ise
in January this year because of a cold.

Japan deplores 5th French nuclear test+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japan expressed strong dissatisfaction Thursday over the fifth
nuclear test this year carried out by France in the South Pacific on
Wednesday.
     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama told reporters that France ''has
said it will stop nuclear testing upon the conclusion of a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, but nuclear testing is
meaningless and France should stop it immediately.''
     Chief Cabinet Secretary Koken Nosaka also expressed regret over
the nuclear testing, saying France's nuclear tests run counter to
international efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament.
     ''France said it would conduct one more test, but 'enough' is
the call of the world,'' said Nosaka, the chief government spokesman,
in a press conference.
     France detonated a nuclear device at Mururoa Atoll in French
Polynesia at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday local time, the fifth test since it
resumed nuclear tests in the South Pacific in September.
     France originally planned to conduct a total of seven or eight
tests, but the government said the number would probably be reduced
to six and that the current series of tests will be completed by the
end of February.
     Foreign Minister Yohei Kono summoned Denis Gauer, acting French
ambassador to Japan, to the ministry to protest the latest nuclear
detonation.
     Gauer told Kono that the sixth test would be conducted earlier
than the end of February.  Kono told the envoy that he cannot condone
further testing by France, officials said.
     Takashi Hiraoka, the mayor of Hiroshima, sent a letter of
protest over the nuclear test to French Ambassador to Japan
Jean-Bernard Ouvrieu on Thursday, urging France to immediately halt
its nuclear testing.
     Hiraoka said he feels ''strong anger'' that France defied the
Dec. 12 U.N. resolution calling for an end to nuclear testing.
     ''It is an action betraying the trust of the people of the
world, and is French egoism,'' Hiraoka said at a news conference.
     Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito said he cannot understand why French
President Jacques Chirac, ''who experienced wars,'' is still unable
to search for coexistence of the human race.
     Nagasaki Mayor Isamu Takada has also sent a letter of protest to
Ouvrieu, stating that the test ignores the world community's desire
for the abolition of nuclear weapons.
     The statement urged France to immediately cease the tests and
work for the early abolition of nuclear weapons.
     About 45 people, members of the Nagasaki Peace Workers' Center
and the Nagasaki chapter of the Japan Congress Against A and H Bombs,
staged a one-hour sit-in to protest the test in front of the bronze
Statue of Peace in Nagasaki Peace Park.
     About 30 members of the Nagasaki branch of a union of
prefectural workers staged a sit-in outside the prefectural
government headquarters and adopted a resolution urging nuclear
powers to promote nuclear disarmament and accept responsibility for
the continued existence of the earth and humankind.
     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura released a statement in his
capacity as leader of New Party Sakigake, saying France's dignity in
the international community ''fell to the ground'' in 1995.
     No matter excuses France makes, it conducts nuclear tests just
to protect itself and that can never be justified, Takemura said.
     Takemura drew international attention when he went to the French
Polynesian island of Tahiti in September to join in a rally to
protest against the French nuclear tests.
     Murayama's Social Democratic Party also denounced the nuclear
test, saying it ''could in no way tolerate'' the repeated testing,
urging the government to recall its ambassador to Paris.
     The party will appeal directly to the French people for support
to stop the testing through an advertisement it plans to run in a
French newspaper, party officials said.
     Meanwhile, a Hiroshima-based group of pacifist mayors around the
world sent a statement criticizing the test to Chirac and other
French leaders.
     The statement by the World Conference of Mayors for Peace
Through Inter-City Solidarity voiced ''strong disappointment'' and
lodged ''a strong protest.''
     In Tokyo, scores of protesters gathered in front of the French
Embassy in Tokyo, renewing their appeal for an immediate halt to
nuclear testing.

13 Diet members to leave for Palestine election monitoring+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Thirteen Diet members will make up a bipartisan delegation to
visit Palestinian self-rule areas as election monitors at the
request of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser
Arafat, officials said Thursday.
     The delegation, which includes members from both houses of the
Diet, will leave Japan on Jan. 16 in time to visit polling stations
during the Jan. 20 election, the officials said.
     The election will establish a Palestinian council to act as
parliament under self-rule.
     Keizo Obuchi, former vice president of the Liberal Democratic
Party, will lead the delegation, the officials said.
     They said the delegation will meet Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres before returning to Tokyo on Jan. 23.

GSDF says 30 garrison towns could be streamlined+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) has drawn up a report,
saying about 30 of its 160 garrison towns nationwide could be
streamlined under Japan's new defense program, according to a copy
of the report made available Thursday.
     The streamlining will be possible because the number of GSDF
members will be reduced to 1,000 or fewer at some 100 garrison towns
under the proposed new defense program, the report says.
     The new defense program outline, which is to replace the current
Cold War-era version mapped out in 1976, is expected to set the
number of GSDF personnel at 145,000, down from the present 180,000.
     The new outline calls for cutting the number of GSDF divisions
to nine from the current 13.
     The GSDF will decide which garrison towns will be streamlined
within five years in the hope that the plan will be carried out in 10
years' time after making adjustments with the municipalities
concerned.
     The government is now working on details of the new defense
program outline so as to have it adopted in time for the start of
fiscal 1996 in April.

Hashimoto says he will push for LDP gov't+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Ryutaro Hashimoto said
Thursday he would fight the next general election with the aim of
achieving a majority of seats for the LDP.
     ''In the next election, we will give it all we've got to win the
people's support for an LDP government,'' Hashimoto said in a
prerecorded New Year program for Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK).
     Hashimoto, the international trade and industry minister, has
apparently articulated his ambition of winning a monopoly on power in
place of the current ruling coalition with the Social Democratic
Party (SDP) and New Party Sakigake, political analysts said.
     But Hashimoto's words are not viewed by LDP watchers as
signaling a new party policy of breaking up the tripartite alliance
any time soon.
     Hashimoto has only paid lip service to some combatant LDP
lawmakers who do not relish being in coalition with the socialists
and have made clear their desire for a monopoly on power, they said.
     Hashimoto also said in the NHK program that the House of
Representatives should not be dissolved for a snap election at least
until the budget for the next fiscal year passes the Diet.
     He added that a dissolution of the lower house is unlikely to
come until after a Group of Seven summit meeting in France at the
end of June.
     The LDP leader said Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected head of the
main opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), harbors some
ideas that are ''diametrically opposed'' to the LDP's policies.

Kuwaiti-Palestinian gains rare refugee status in Japan+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A Palestinian whose original application for refugee status in
Japan was turned down in 1992 on Thursday became the first and only
person among hundreds of such applicants to be granted the status on
appeal to the justice minister.
     Fawaz Housein El Hanafy, 29, of Ichikawa, Chiba Prefecture,
first applied for refugee status after arriving in Japan in November
1991.  The application was rejected in November 1992 and he appealed.
     Between 1982 and June this year, 357 people have used a system
which allows applicants to appeal directly to the minister if their
application is turned down.  Fawaz is the first whose appeal has been
accepted.
     Makoto Iwai, manager of the Japanese branch of the human rights
organization Amnesty International, told a press conference shared
with Fawaz in Tokyo that the case could signify a change in the
appeals system.
     ''I would like to see this case serve as the catalyst for a
change in the way Japan recognizes refugees,'' Iwai said.
     The ministry has not clarified its reasons for granting the
status to Fawaz.
     But supporters of Fawaz said it appeared the ministry had not
appreciated the need to grant him refugee status at the time of his
initial application because an Iranian interpreter used by the
ministry did not understand his Arabic.
     They said another possible reason for the decision to grant him
refugee status was Fawaz's statelessness which meant there would be
no diplomatic repercussions.
     Fawaz was born stateless in Kuwait to parents who left the Gaza
Strip after the foundation of Israel in 1948.
     After Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in 1990 and the Palestine
Liberation Organization threw its support behind Iraq, feeling
against Palestinians in Kuwait ran high and Fawaz said he was forced
to flee the country fearing the Kuwaiti government was about to
apprehend him.

U.S. forces to ease 'off-limits' for Okinawa servicemen+

NAHA, Japan, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     The U.S. military informed the city of Okinawa on Thursday that
it will relax Saturday a ban on its personnel from entering busy
streets, a measure taken after the indictment of three of its
servicemen on charges of raping a local schoolgirl.
     ''Off-limits'' hours, which stretch from midnight to 6 a.m. at
present, will be shortened to between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m.
     Out of concern over the effect on local restaurants and other
entertainment businesses, however, city authorities are still
demanding the total lifting of the ban, which the U.S. forces imposed
Oct. 14
     It was the first ''off-limits'' measure taken by the U.S.
military in Japan since the southwesternmost Japanese prefecture was
returned to Tokyo in 1972 after 27 years of U.S. occupation.
     The measure was not welcomed by proprietors in the area whose
businesses depend largely on U.S. service personnel.
     Noting that about 10 restaurants and bars have already been
forced to close due to the measure, city officials think it is
unlikely that the partial relaxation will dramatically change the
situation.
     Japanese prosecutors have indicted three U.S. servicemen on
charges of abducting and raping an Okinawa schoolgirl in early
September.
     The case has caused anger among Japanese, especially in Okinawa
Prefecture where three quarters of U.S. military facilities in Japan
are concentrated in terms of land space.

Ozawa gets 3 ex-premiers to accept party jobs+

TOKYO, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Ichiro Ozawa, the newly elected president of the main
opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), said Thursday he
has secured commitments from three former prime ministers within
Shinshinto to accept senior party posts and support the party in the
next election.
     After successive talks with Tsutomu Hata, who lost the party's
presidential election to Ozawa, Toshiki Kaifu and Morihiro Hosokawa,
Ozawa said, ''I obtained agreements from the three'' to assuming
''significant party posts.''
     Ozawa, who was formally named president of Shinshinto at a
meeting of party Diet members earlier Thursday, underlined his
readiness to launch an all-out fight against the coalition government
of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama.
     The hard-line new opposition leader also made no secret of his
intention of resorting to every possible means to force Murayama to
dissolve the House of Representatives for a snap general election.
     The 53-year-old Ozawa, previously the party's secretary general,
will serve a two-year term, replacing outgoing Shinshinto President
Kaifu, who did not seek reelection.
     Following the inauguration, Ozawa immediately started forming
the new party leadership, with the primary aim of restoring party
unity ahead of the next election.
     Ozawa told a press conference that he plans to create a new
advisory panel for the party chief to incorporate the views of the
three former prime ministers.
     Their presence in party machinery will help consolidate a united
front, he said.
     He also said at the press conference that Shinshinto has an
important ''mission'' in the face of many problems confronting Japan
both at home and abroad.
     ''I am not necessarily very confident that I can fulfill this
responsibility as party head, but I will do my best,'' he said.
     He called the Murayama government ''irresponsible'' for adopting
a controversial plan to use 685 billion yen of taxpayers' money to
liquidate seven moribund housing loan companies and reiterated his
intention of forcing him into an early election.
     Hardly had Ozawa begun attempting to heal the party rift when
rival Hata apparently moved to keep his distance from the chief.
     Hata's supporters set up a preparation committee for a new
policy study group, which a close Hata aide said is aimed at helping
young members to win elections but which could become a faction-like
grouping.
     The group will seek to make Shinshinto ''a fair and open party''
by incorporating opinions from rank-and-file members and discussing
Ozawa's policy proposals, according to the supporters.
     They said the study group will be established before a regular
Diet session starts in January.
     Meanwhile, Ozawa made the round of greetings with the leaders of
other parties.
     At the headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), to
which Ozawa once belonged, President Ryutaro Hashimoto, trade
minister, greeted Ozawa by saying, ''Welcome back and
congratulations.''
     ''It is really a long time (since I left the party),'' Ozawa
said, adding he felt as if he had come home.
     When Ozawa asked for Hashimoto's ''guidance,'' the LDP head
said, ''We both bear responsibility for the Japanese people and for
the world.  Let's put our shoulders to the wheels.''
     Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who heads the Social
Democratic Party, congratulated Ozawa on his ''overwhelming victory.''
     At the headquarters of New Party Sakigake headed by Finance
Minister Masayoshi Takemura, acting party chief Shusei Tanaka courted
Ozawa, saying the two parties may strike an alliance on some
important issues.
     Ozawa responded by saying, ''I have no intention of engaging in
mere Diet maneuverings.  We can work together on some high-level
problems.''

U.S. serviceman indicted for possession of rifle+

AOMORI, Japan, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A U.S. serviceman from Misawa base in northern Japan was
indicted Thursday for alleged possession of a rifle and bullets
without a permit.
     The serviceman, Airman 2nd Class John Turner, 25, was released
the same day on bail of 1 million yen after he was indicted by
prosecutors in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture.
     Prosecutors allege the rifle and 12 bullets were found in a car
Turner was driving Dec. 13.  Police arrested him that day.
     Police said Turner is also suspected of firing a hunting rifle
in a park in Misawa on Dec. 10 and that once sufficient evidence is
collected they could send papers to the prosecutors on the case early
next month alleging he fired the rifle in an area banned to hunting.
     They said Turner has already admitted to most of the details in
the prosecution case.
     Police said at the time that a park worker heard four gunshots
and immediately saw two foreigners in the park holding a rifle.
     The two men then left in a car with a U.S. forces number plate,
according to the worker.  Nobody was injured in the incident.

Japan's defense chief may visit Russia next year: Tass+

MOSCOW, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     Japanese Defense Agency chief Seishiro Eto may visit Moscow
next year for talks with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev for
the first-ever defense summit between the two countries, a senior
Russian official said Thursday.
     Russia is fully prepared to maintain contacts with Japan in the
military sphere at the highest possible level, Deputy Foreign
Minister Alexander Panov told Itar-Tass news agency.
     While the two countries agreed to make efforts to arrange Eto's
visit to Russia, an accord on the schedule has yet to be reached,
according to Japanese diplomatic sources.
     Tass quoted Panov as saying there can be no real change for the
better if there is no dialogue.

Japanese envoy protests at French nuclear test+

PARIS, Dec. 28 Kyodo

     A senior Japanese diplomat protested Thursday against the
latest French nuclear test conducted in the South Pacific late
Wednesday.
      Charge d'Affaires to France Yutaka Iimura told a French Foreign
Ministry official in charge of Asian affairs that it is extremely
regrettable that France has conducted another nuclear test at Mururoa
Atoll, the fifth in the recent series, Japanese officials said.
     Pointing out that the United Nations passed a resolution in the
General Assembly on Dec. 12 calling for the immediate termination of
all nuclear tests, Iimura called on France to stop such tests.
     The French official only reiterated that Paris is ready to sign
a comprehensive test ban treaty soon after the current series of
tests is complete, the officials said.

U.S. plans int'l investment forum for ex-communist states+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     The United States is likely to propose setting up a forum to
allow former Soviet Union and East European governments to exchange
information with companies in industrialized nations that are
interested in investing in the region, trade ministry officials said
Friday.
     The proposal will be made when trade ministers of the Group of
Seven (G-7) major industrialialized nations meet their counterparts
from Russia, Poland and 12 other ex-communist states in Baltimore,
Maryland, on Jan. 8-10 to discuss support for their economic reforms
efforts.
     The U.S. is sounding out other participating nations about the
forum, which could be a key issue at the meeting, the officials of the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
     The East-West trade ministers' conference, which will also be
attended by business representatives, started in 1992 and the
upcoming session will be the fourth such meeting.
     At the meeting, the ministers will gauge achievements under last
year's Warsaw Declaration which calls for cumulative investment in
the former Soviet and East European states to hit 200 billion dollars
by the turn of the century, the officials said.
     The participants, meanwhile, will discuss the target countries'
tax systems relative to trade and investment as well as concrete
steps to improve business practices in the region, they added.
     Also on the agenda will be practical advice on accounting
procedures and market surveys for promoting privatization of
state-run enterprises and conversion of military contractors into
civilian corporations, according to the officials.
     The Japanese mission will consist of MITI Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto as well as executives from trading houses, banks and other
relevant companies, the officials said.
     After the trade gathering, Hashimoto will go to Washington and
stay there until Jan. 13 to meet ranking U.S. government officials
and Congressional leaders.  The trade ministry is also planning to
include a meeting with President Bill Clinton in his itinerary, they
said.

Ozawa names Yonezawa, Hata's aides for key party posts+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Ichiro Ozawa, newly-elected president of the main opposition
Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), on Friday named Takashi Yonezawa as
the party's secretary general and gave senior party posts to two
aides of his rival Tsutomu Hata, party officials said.
     In forming the new party leadership, Ozawa apparently placed
priority on healing the wounds left by the bitter battle with Hata in
the presidential election.
     Yonezawa was previously chairman of the now-defunct Democratic
Socialist Party, one of nine parties and groups that merged to form
Shinshinto in December last year.
     Ozawa named Hajime Funada, a close aide to Hata, as acting
chairman of the Political Activities Council under Kozo Watanabe, who
continues to head the key council.
     Another Hata follower, Kazuo Aichi, was appointed as chairman of
the Policy Research Council.
     Ozawa was formally named party president Thursday after
overwhelming his sole rival, former Prime Minister Hata, in the party
presidential race.
     The new party executive line-up was announced by the new
secretary general Yonezawa at a press conference in the Diet building.
     Shinshinto chief Ozawa also created a ''supreme advisory
council'' within the party and appointed to it as members three
former prime ministers -- Toshiki Kaifu, Morihiro Hosokawa and Hata.
     Ozawa himself also took the post of the chairman of the
''tomorrow cabinet.''
     New Secretary General Yonezawa said at a press conference that a
''well-balanced'' executive body has been formed.

MOF vice minister to quit over ministry scandals++

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Administrative Vice Finance Minister Kyosuke Shinozawa will
resign at the beginning of next year amid a storm of criticism of
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) following a series of financial
scandals, including the involvement of ministry officials in
improper activities.
     Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura on Friday accepted
Shinozawa's offer of resignation.
     Shinozawa, who took the ministry's top administrative post last
May, offered to resign after the ministry presented its draft fiscal
1996 budget Dec. 20.
     Tadashi Ogawa, director general of the National Tax
Administration Agency, will succeed Shinozawa as vice finance
minister.
     Shinozawa's resignation and the appointment of his successor
will be formally approved at a cabinet meeting Jan. 5.
     At a hastily arranged press conference, Takemura said, ''I have
accepted Shinozawa's resignation to improve the morale of the
ministry, which is under an oppressive atmosphere following scandals
involving ministry officials.''
     ''Shinozawa is not quitting to take the blame for any individual
incident, such as the failure of two Tokyo credit unions or the
ministry's decision to use taxpayers' money for the liquidation of
ailing housing loan companies,'' he said.
     In talks with reporters after the press conference, Shinozawa
said, ''I have decided to step down to let some fresh air into the
ministry from the start of the New Year.''
     Shinozawa said he is not resigning to take responsibility for
the ministry's response to any individual incident.
     The ministry has been under fierce criticism at home and abroad
for its lack of transparency in dealing with a series of incidents
that have hit the financial industry, including the bad loan issue at
housing loan companies and a huge loss cover-up at Daiwa Bank's New
York branch.
     Domestic criticism is focused on a series of scandals involving
ministry officials.
     So far this year, two senior ministry officials, including
Yoshio Nakajima, head of the Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy,
a Finance Ministry affiliate, have quit after they were found to have
had cozy relations with people linked to the two failed Tokyo credit
unions involved in illicit loan scandals.
     Shinozawa said he had pondered whether he should resign at a
time when the ministry was about to proceed with a liquidation scheme
recently mapped out for struggling housing loan companies.
     But he thought it necessary for him, as the top-ranking
bureaucrat, to take action after a year which saw so many incidents
take place, Shinozawa said.
     At the news conference, Takemura said he currently has no
intention to resign to take the blame for the series of financial
scandals.
     ''It is my responsibility to flesh out the liquidation scheme
for ailing housing loan companies,'' he said.
     Since Takemura became finance minister in June 1994, Shinozawa
is the second vice finance minister to resign before the expiry of
his term of office.
     Shinozawa's predecessor, Jiro Saito, resigned in May under
strong pressure from the Liberal Democratic Party, the largest of the
three coalition parties, for his strong ties with key opposition
leader Ichiro Ozawa and their joint campaign to legislate a
''national welfare tax'' that he and Ozawa reportedly devised to
replace the 3% comsumption tax.
     Takemura told the news conference Friday he has selected Ogawa
as Shinozawa's successor and added Ogawa will be replaced at the
National Tax Administration Agency by Sohei Hidaka, director general
of the ministry's Securities Bureau.

Upper house VP agrees to pay debts with expense money+

AOMORI, Japan, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     House of Councillors Vice President Kanpei Matsuo has reached
an agreement with a credit union to pay back some 700 million yen in
loans using part of his public expense account, informed sources
said Friday.
     Matsuo has promised the credit union in Aomori Prefecture that
he will use part of the 29 million yen annual expense allotment for
the vice presidential post to pay back loans owed by himself and
related companies.
     Matsuo has been in arrears on the loans, with principal now
totaling 700 million yen.  Some of the loans date back 20 years.
     Matsuo said his own loans amount to only about 40 million yen,
adding that the rest is owed by those for whom he has given
guarantees.
     ''There is no legal problem to the arrangement,'' he said.
