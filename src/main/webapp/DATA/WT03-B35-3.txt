SUPERPHENIX TO SHUT DOWN IN EARLY 1997 FOR REFURBISHMENT

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Superphenix prototype nuclear plant will be shut down for five months
in early 1997 for modifications to its fast breeder reactor, which will
henceforth be used for research, local authorities announced on October
11. The modifications, announced during an information meeting with the
officials, will mainly involve the replacement of some subassemblies in
the reactor's core and the installation of experimental sub-assemblies
"with a higher plutonium content or containing radioactive waste with a
long half-life, such as neptunium". The Superphenix plant, located at
Creys-Malville, in France's Rhone-Alpes region, has encountered many
problems since it was opened in 1986 and has actually operated very little
since that date. Back on line in August 1994, the plant is now running at
60% capacity. Its management expects authorisation for an increase to 90%
shortly, but will not ask permission to turn Superphenix up to 100% power,
given the short time remaining before the shutdown.

In its annual report, the French Court of Auditors has estimated the total
cost of Superphenix at 60 billion French Francs. A spokesman for the plant
said that this calculation was based on a shutdown in 2000, while the
programme provided for operation until 2015. The representative also
indicated that the 51% of the fast breeder reactor's costs were being
assumed by EDF and 49% by Italy and a consortium of several other
countries. He said that the reactor could make a "decisive" contribution
to research into energy options for the year 2025 and beyond.

PAPOUTSIS CALLS FOR PRE-COMPETITIVE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY POLICY.

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

"This is an opportune moment to define a Community-wide policy for
pre-competitive activities in the field of energy technologies, with the
main objective of meeting the urgent needs of EU industry and society at
large", said Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis during a conference on
October 11. He warned that while EU firms are among the world leaders in
the manufacture and supply of clean and efficient energy technologies, the
European Union has been less successful than the United States and Japan
in the diffusion of research and the development and marketing of proven
technologies. A future initiative for energy technologies must focus not
on the development of technology per se, he explained, but rather on its
use to meet the immediate needs of the market and the citizen. It must
also contain activities dealing with all the stages in the technological
development process, including R&D and market commercialisation.

COMMISSION LAUNCHES JOULE PROJECT SELECTION INVESTIGATION.

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commission has decided to launch a detailed inquiry to ensure
that the procedural rules governing EU funds for Joule projects of
research into renewable forms of energy are obeyed without exception,
Research Commissioner Edith Cresson has responded in answer to a
Parliamentary question about the falsification of Joule programme expert
reports. The Commission has already publicly denied and demonstrated to
the European Parliament that these accusations - the latest appearing in
the Austrian magazine Sonnenzeitung - were false, the Commissioner said,
and it "vigorously refutes" any unjustified allegations made against the
Ezio Andreta, the Director responsible for research and technological
development projects concerning energy. However, Commissioner Cresson
confirmed that another Commission official involved, Wolfgang Palz, has
been assigned to other duties - with his consent - while awaiting the
results of the inquiry.

VAN MIERT SEEKS "CLARIFICATIONS" OVER ELECTRABEL ACCORDS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has written to the
Belgian Government asking for "clarifications" over plans by the power
utility ELECTRABEL, to force local authorities into long-term electricity
supply contracts, it was revealed on October 22. In March this year,
Electrabel, which is privately owned, offered the Belgian intercommunales
(joint ventures between municipalities for electricity distribution) the
chance to buy stakes in the company in return for signing 30-year
electricity distribution contracts. Mr Van Miert has repeatedly said that,
under EU rules on free and fair competition, he will not accept contracts
lasting more than 15 years.

The Commissioner is now reported to have asked the Belgian authorities for
a clearer explanation of how much freedom the local authorities will have
to end the contracts with Electrabel and choose to go to another supplier.
An EU source said that although the Commission had recently received a
letter from Leo Peeters, Flemish Minister for Home Affairs, agreeing "in
principle" to the 15-year contracts, Mr Van Miert was concerned about
recent indications that the parties to the agreements might be planning a
U-turn over commitments made in May for a definite reduction in their
duration.

EUROPE'S LARGEST WIND ENERGY PLANT OPENS IN WALES

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The largest wind energy plant in Europe began operating on October 23,
according to NATIONAL POWER, the British electricity production company.
Located in Carno, Wales, the plant is capable of producing enough energy
to meet the needs of 25,000 homes. The plant, equipped with 56 turbines
and able to generate up to 33 megawatts of electricity, cost National
Power GBP26 million (about USD41 million). According to Hugh
Babington-Smith, Executive Director of the British Wind Energy
Association, 10% of the UK's electricity could be produced by wind by
2025. If the Government adopted this goal, 13,000 new jobs could be
created in wind energy production. Currently, about 150,000 people in
Britain get their electricity from 31 wind energy plants. "We have 40% of
Europe's total wind resources, but we risk falling behind the rest of the
world in wind energy development", Mr Babington-Smith added. The County of
Powys, a rural area of Wales, will now obtain 40% of its electricity from
four wind-powered generating plants.

FRENCH PETROLEUM INDUSTRY EXPANDS DURING 1996

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The French upstream oil industry is expected to see a slight increase in
turnover during 1996, to about 49 billion French Francs from 48 billion in
1995, according to an annual survey by the French Petroleum Institute
(Institut Francais du Petrole - IFP), the Committee on Oil and Marine
Studies (Comite d'Etudes Petroli
res et Marines - CEPM) and the Groupement
des Entreprises Parapetroli
res et paragazi
res (GEP) published on October
22. Next year also looks promising, with three-quarters of the companies
surveyed (accounting for 65% of turnover in the industry) expecting their
business to grow. Service providers were particularly optimistic. Despite
strong international competition, the French oil industry has once again
managed to play an important role on the world market, according to
figures provided by the IFP, CEPM and GDP. The world oil exploration and
production market is estimated at between USD110 and 120 billion,
including the countries of the former Soviet Union. France claims a 6%
market share. In 1995, turnover in the upstream oil industry, at 48
billion Francs, was 6% higher than the year before. The increase was
particularly marked in the offshore sector, which had a 32% rise in
activity, followed by a slight slump in 1996. More than 80% of turnover is
generated outside the country and climbed from 25 to 40 billion Francs
between 1990 and 1995. The share of business in the rest of Western
Europe, outside France, is estimated at FF13 billion. The UK, Norway and
the Netherlands are major customers, but Germany and other European
countries are also valuable markets. French firms conduct nearly
one-fourth of their foreign business in Africa. However, they are minor
players in North America and particularly the United States.

BRITISH ENERGY TO SHED 1,460 JOBS OVER THREE YEARS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

BRITISH ENERGY, which owns and operates Britain's eight most modern
nuclear power stations has rocked the trade unions by unveiling plans to
shed 1,460 jobs over the next three years. The workforce of the company
privatised in mid-July will be reduced to 4,800. British Energy's Managing
Director, Robert Hawley, lays claim to a clear and simple strategy to
reduce costs and improve efficiency in order to ensure the nuclear energy
company can continue to compete effectively with conventional electricity
generation. Mr Hawley has reiterated the company's promise to never
compromise its total commitment to safety, insisting there would be little
point in reducing staff numbers if safety standards could not be
maintained. The plan is expected to secure wage cost savings of about
GBP50 million per year. British Energy will, however, need to offset
restructuring costs of about GBP100 million, which will be covered by
existing funds and spread over three years.

The restructuring at British Energy is part of a general trend of job cuts
in the privatised energy sector. By the year 2000, British Energy will
have reduced its 1992 workforce by 40%. POWERGEN and NATIONAL POWER,
Britain's leading traditional generators, will have reduced their
workforces by 71 ands 63% respectively.

FOREIGN INVESTORS FLOCK TO GAZPROM

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

GAZPROM will enter international markets at the relatively high price of
USUSD1.57 a share, with foreign investors queuing up for a share of the
jewel of Russian industry. However, analysts are still questioning whether
Gazprom, which holds a quarter of global gas reserves, is really a good
deal or rather an over-weight monster that will always be tarnished by the
stigma of the Soviet era. The company has announced profits of USD3.5
billion for 1995, but accounts will only be published according to
international standards from this year, providing a more accurate
barometer of its health.

The conglomerate has announced that Gazprom shares will begin trading on
international stock markets on October 28, at USD15.75 for batches of ten
shares. Company Chairman Rem Viakhirev, has indicated that the share issue
is heavily over-subscribed despite the fact the price is three times
higher than on internal stock markets (about USD0.6 a share). Gazprom will
issue 23.7 million batches of ten shares -American Deposit Stocks (ADS)-
representing a little more than 1% of the company. This initial sale is
expected to raise USD400 million, with Gazprom planing to float a further
8% of capital on the international markets. The share price values the
conglomerate at USD38.5 billion, a fairly modest sum, given that Gazprom,
a giant even by monopoly standards, sells nearly USD8 billion worth of
natural gas to the West each year. A brochure published by Gazprom at the
beginning of the year, estimated the company's real value at closer to
USD5 a share. Despite being Europe's leading gas exporter, with a
workforce of 230,000 employed in 40 subsidiaries, and 145,000 kilometres
of gas pipelines throughout the former USSR, Gazprom nonetheless remains a
high risk enigma for foreign investors.

ON-SHORE BUSINESS SHAVES 7% OFF NORSK HYDRO PROFITS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Norwegian group NORSK HYDRO (oil, gas, chemicals, petrochemicals,
fertilizers) has announced a 7% fall in pre-tax profits over the first
nine months of the year, blamed on a decline in "on-shore" activities
which higher than anticipated oil prices have been unable to offset. At
8.403 billion Norwegian Krone (USD 1.292 billion), profits are NKr 450
million short of analysts' forecasts, and compare with a profit of NKr
9.023 billion over the corresponding period last year. Norsk Hydro
turnover is up 6% from NKr 59.464 billion to 63.121 billion (USD 9.710
billion), with operating profits down 9% to NKr 7.899 billion.

The company is blaming the fall in profits on a decline in revenue from
on-shore activities. High prices for aluminium and petrochemical products
last year have fallen back this year. In addition, the group has been
forced to tap operating profits to pay higher taxes brought about by an
increase in the proportion of revenue from the oil and gas sectors. Norsk
Hydro Chairman Egil Myklebust claims this varied picture again illustrates
how the company's diverse activities have a balancing effect on our
revenue. He believes the group's avowed goal of securing an operating
profit of NKr 10 billion for the year as a whole is still within reach.

The oil and gas sector has seen a 96% increase in operating profits to NKr
4.291 billion (USD 660.1 million) over the first nine months of the year,
thanks to the high price of hydrocarbons and increased production, up 17%
to 3.4 million tonnes oil equivalent. The average price of crude oil has
risen 32% over the third quarter to NKr 136 (USD 20.9) per barrel. In 1995
the group posted record pre-tax profits of NKr 11.089 billion (USD1.706
billion).

SHELL THREATENS TO PROSECUTE ROMANIA'S CRP

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

Anglo-Dutch oil multinational ROYAL DUTCH SHELL is threatening to bring
charges against the state-controlled Romanian oil company CRP, which it
has accused of discriminating against private clients. In an open letter
dated October 15 and signed jointly with the Italian oil company AGIP,
Shell argues that the creation of CRP this Summer threatens to represent
"a step backwards" with "disastrous consequences" for the Romanian oil
industry. If CRP wants to take a step forwards it must respect two
fundamental principles: profitability and non-discrimination. However
recent practices have, according to Shell, highlighted flagrant violations
of these principles. The company claims that refineries controlled by CRP
tend to discriminate against independent distributors, and in favour of
other clients that have close ties with the company, despite being "bad
payers". A CRP spokesman has rejected these accusations, insisting that
Shell has enjoyed the same treatment as other clients. Since moving on to
the Romanian market two years ago, the Anglo-Dutch giant has established a
chain of service stations around Bucharest and plans to extend its network
throughout the country. Shell warns that if the current situation
continues, CRP will have to answer in court for the abuse of its dominant
market position, and indeed violation of the Energy Charter that Romania
signed. The World Bank, which has granted Romania a USD175 million loan to
regenerate the oil sector, recently condemned the creation of the CRP as
"contrary to market deregulation".

ELF OFFERS OUTLETS FOR QATARI GAS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The French oil company ELF AQUITAINE has highlighted access to outlets as
part of its bid to participate in liquefied natural gas projects in Qatar.
Speaking on October 17, on the sidelines of an international gas
conference in Abou Dhabi, Bruno Karcher of Elf's gas division indicated
that the French oil group believes it can guarantee outlets in Europe for
LNG from Qatar, which has the region's second largest gas reserves,
estimated at 7,000 billion cubic metres. Mr Karcher indicated that this
offer has been passed on to the Qatari Government. The state-run
conglomerate Qatar General Petroleum Corporation (QGPC) is the majority
shareholder in three LNG export projects, one of which, Qatargas, should
be operational by the end of the year. The other two, Rasgas and
Enron/QGPC are still at the planning stage. The foreign partners in
Qatargas are MOBIL (United States), TOTAL (France) and the Japanese
companies MITSUI and MARUBENI, and outlets have already been secured in
Japan for all Qatargas production. Rasgas, in which Mobil has a 30% stake,
has thus far placed only a quarter of maximum projected production in
South Korea. Finally, the American company ENRON and QGPC are expected to
finalise an agreement to build a third gas liquefaction plant later this
year. Enron plans to market production in Israel, Jordan and India.

INAUGURATION OF THE MAGHREB-EUROPE GAS PIPELINE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline will be opened at the end of October or
the beginning of November, Algeria's Energy Minister Amar Makhloufi
announced on October 14, indicating that final tests are progressing
according to plan. Begun in 1994, the pipeline will link Algeria's Hassi
R'Mel gas field to the Spanish city of Seville, via Morocco and the
Straits of Gibraltar. 1,265 km long and with an initial capacity of 8
billion m3/year the pipeline will initially supply the Spanish and
Moroccan markets, and later Portugal, France and Germany, as capacity
increases to 20 billion m3/year about the year 2000. With the entry into
service of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline, the second structure linking
Algeria to Europe, after the Transmed pipeline laid at the beginning of
the 1980s between Hassi R'Mel and Italy, Algeria expects to double gas
exports by the beginning of the next millennium.

GREEN LIGHT FOR ELF NEGOTIATIONS ON NEW DEPOSIT IN AZERBAIJAN

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Azerbaijani President, Gueidar Aliev, has authorised the French oil
company ELF AQUITAINE to finalise negotiations on becoming the principal
operator of an major exploration zone in the Caspian Sea. Announced on
October 11, the Presidential green light coincided with the French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette's visit to Baku, on the last stage of a
three-day tour of the Caucuses that took him from Armenia to Georgia and
finally to Azerbaijan. ELF is now free to pursue negotiations with the
Azerbaijani oil company SOCAR, and draw up a definitive agreement for the
exploration and exploitation of the Leninakan offshore field, which may
contain up to 50 million tonnes of oil. The agreement will leave ELF
controlling the field with a 75% stake in operations.

Joel Bouchaud, Elf's Director for the Orient, the CIS and Latin American,
explained that the company's objective will now be to finalise an
agreement before President Aliev's the official visit to France on January
13. Mr Bouchaud indicated that once contracts have been exchanged, Elf may
surrender a part of its stake. In April 1995 ELF missed out on an
important contract for the exploitation of the Chirag-Azeri-Gunshli field,
now operated by the Americans. In June, Elf secured a 10% stake in the
exploration of the Chahdeniz field controlled jointly by BRITISH PETROLEUM
and the Norwegian company STATOIL. Azerbaijani oil reserves are estimated
at about a billion tonnes. 8 million tonnes are currently extracted
annually, compared with 40 million tonnes during Azerbaijan's Soviet
period.

On October 19, RWE, Germany's leading regional energy utility, announced
net profits of 1.2 billion Deutschemarks for the 1995/96 financial year
(July to June) a 10% improvement on the previous year. Turnover has risen
2.9% from DM 63.6 billion to 65.4 billion. The group proposes to raise its
share dividend from DM 1.40 in 1994/95 to DM 1.50. These figures are in
line with provisional results published at the beginning of July.

RWE's Board has also announced the appointment of Clemens Boersig to the
post of Financial Director from April 1, 1997. 48 years old, Mr Boersig is
currently a member of the Board of ROBERT BOSH GmbH. Two Directors of RWE
subsidiaries will also join the Board next year: from April 1, Thomas
Geitner, presently Chairman of the LAHMEYER AG and RHEINELEKTRA AG Boards,
and from June 1, Rudolf Schwan a member of the RWE ENERGIE AG Board.

COAL USE AND OUTPUT IN WESTERN EUROPE STILL FALLING

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

With coal use in Western Europe expected to continue its decline as more
and more energy efficiency and ecological control measures are
implemented, the urgent application of clean coal technologies will be
essential in asserting a role for coal in sustainable energy development,
the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) reported on
October 10. In a survey of coal developments in Eastern and Western Europe
in 1995/1996, the ECE says the future of coal will increasingly depend on
the electricity industry as demand from other sectors, such as
coke-making, is forecast to continue declining. Some 85% of the hard coal
and virtually all of the brown coal consumed in the ECE region (which
covers both East and West Europe) was used for heat and electricity in
1995, compared with only about 12% of ECE hard coal output used for
coke-making. Coal provides close to 40% of the ECE region's electricity,
and after oil and natural gas is the area's most important source of
primary energy.

The UN/ECE notes that the decline of coal production in Europe has
accelerated since 1990, with hard coal output falling about 30 million
tonnes (or 5%) in 1995, taking it to 19% of global output as compared to
25% in 1990. While a temporary stabilisation of output is forecast for
1996, further reductions are planned for the 1996-2005 period, especially
in Germany, France, Poland and Russia. Overall European coal exports have
also declined from some 80 million tonnes in 1990 to 70 million in 1995;
Western European exports have virtually ceased.

EU PETROL AND HEATING OIL PRICES UP ON OCTOBER 21

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

All categories of EU fuel and heating oil prices rose between October 7
and October 21, according to figures from the European Commission's Energy
Directorate-General (DGXVII). Continuing a four-week trend, the average
price of premium-grade petrol rose slightly from ECU 216.92/1,000 litres
to ECU 220.61/1,000 litres, Euro-super unleaded premium-grade was up to
ECU 232.46/1,000 litres from ECU 227.30/1,000 litres, and motor diesel
jumped to ECU 251.14/1,000 litres from ECU 238.60/1,000 litres. Heating
oil prices increased to ECU 221.41/1,000 litres from ECU 219.50/1,000
litres (and rose as high as ECU 225.58/1,000 litres on October 14), and
residual fuel oil prices were up to ECU 123.99 from ECU 119.83 per 1,000
litres on average.

ELECTRICITY: EUROPEAN PRODUCTION BELOW OECD AVERAGE IN JULY

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

European electricity production increased by 3.1% in the first seven
months of 1996 as compared to the same period last year, while output in
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development region as a
whole rose 3.6%, the International Energy Agency announced in its monthly
electricity survey published on October 10. By way of comparison,
increases of 4.6% were registered in the United States, 3.3% in Japan,
1.7% in Canada and 1.2% in Australia.

Electricity output in OECD Europe increased by 1.4% to 187.8 terawatt
hours in July 1996 compared with twelve months before, and nuclear and
thermal electricity production increased by 6.4% (to 60.7 TWh) and 3.7%
(to 88.6 TWh) respectively. In contrast, hydro-electric power generation
fell, for the second month in a row, by 10.0% to 38.5 TWh

US electricity output declined by 1.3% (to 288.9 TWh), due primarily to a
drop in thermal and nuclear power generation of 2.2% (to 199.8 TWh) and
1.7% (to 61.0 TWh) respectively and a 6.6% rise in hydro-electricity
production (to 28.2 TWh).

Electricity output in Japan increased by 4.7% following an 8.3% rise in
nuclear production, a 7.3% rise in thermal electricity output and a drop
of 14.2% in hydro -electricity generation.

Canada also saw an increase in electricity output; but only of 1.5%,
resulting from a rise in hydro-power generation of 10.9% and a fall in
nuclear and thermal electricity production of 15.6% and 8.0% respectively.

NORWAY EAGER TO SELL GAS TO POLAND.

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Norwegian Foreign Minister, Bjorn Tore Godal, has indicated that his
Government would support the sale of gas to Poland. Accompanying King
Harald V on an official visit to Warsaw on October 15, Mr Godal's
declaration came after a meeting with his Polish counterpart Dariusz
Rosati. The two Ministers nevertheless agreed that the conclusion of
concrete agreements should be left to specialised companies. Mr Rosati
claims that Polish companies have long been interested in purchasing gas
from Norway, as Russian gas supplies will be insufficient to cover demand.
Moreover, the Minister is aware that Poland would do well to diversify its
supply sources, in order to guarantee energy security. At the end of
September, Poland signed an important contract with Russia covering the
supply of 250 billion m3 of Siberian gas over 25 years. The first three
billion m3 should reach Poland in 1997, with supplies rising to 14 billion
m3 per year by 2010.

TAXATION/EXCISE DUTIES: COMMISSION SOON TO PROPOSE TAXES ON ALL ENERGY
SOURCES

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commission is expected to come up with a proposal before the
end of November for an increase in minimum excise duty rates on mineral
oils and the inclusion of other energy sources - electricity, natural gas,
coal and perhaps even biofuels - in the excise duty system. If the
proposal is approved by the full team of Commissioners and the Council of
Finance Ministers (which could be more difficult), excise duties on
mineral oils would gradually be increased, particularly in those Member
States that currently have the lowest taxes. With the proposed energy/CO2
tax stalled for the past four years, the Commission's main goal is now to
win acceptance for the principle of some kind of tax, no matter how small,
on all energy sources. The proposal, which puts more emphasis on the
principle than actual tax rates, has already created "very serious
tensions" within the Commission, according to well-placed sources.

Since January 1, 1993, the Member States have been required to set excise
duties rates on mineral oils above a Community minimum rate (expressed in
ECU) for each product and its particular use (heating oil, lead-free
petrol, etc.) under Directive 92/82/EEC governing excise duties on mineral
oils. The same excise duty system covers tobacco and alcoholic drinks too
(although the Commission does not intend to modify the rates for these
products at the moment). A closer convergence of duty rates among the
Member States within the Single Market to prevent distortions of
competition was one of the Commission's and the Member States' objectives
in adopting this system. Some current minimum rates are listed below.

* Heavy fuel oil: ECU 13 per 1,000 kg

* liquefied petroleum gas and methane for industrial use: ECU 36/1,000 kg

* leaded petrol: ECU 337 /1,000 litres

* lead-free petrol: ECU 287/1,000 litres

Commission sources say that minimum rates should now be increased, not
only to keep pace with inflation, but also as a first step towards a
closer approximation of rates (setting a minimum rate tends to be
ineffective, since market forces push rates downward, according to
experts). This approximation of rates would discourage cross-border
shopping and would incorporate environmental concerns into policies in
other areas, now that the specific proposal for an energy/CO2 tax has
foundered. New rates should be high enough to create an incentive, but not
so high as to ruin the proposal's chances of adoption by the
Commissioners, informed sources explain. To soften the psychological and
practical impact of these measures, the increase would be gradual.
Commission experts speak of raising rates by about 30% over five to ten
years, but this is only theoretical. Several Directorate-Generals - DG III
(Industry), DG XXI (Taxation), DG XI (Environment), DG XV (Internal
Market) and DG XVII (Energy) must still consult among themselves.

Most of the Member States apply taxes at levels well above Community
minimum rates. But others (Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg)
impose rates on certain products (some types of mineral oils) that are
equivalent to or only slightly higher than the minimum. These Member
States would eventually be required to raise their minimum rates to comply
with the new European minima (and for this reason are likely to oppose the
proposal in Council). The rise would also concern those States whose rates
are already well above the minimum rates. "This increase would give Member
States with high excise duty rates more room to manoeuvre, making excise
duties higher everywhere", says an expert on this issue, also bringing up
the concept of shifting taxes on labour to other bases, preferably with a
positive impact in terms of environmental protection.

These are exactly the arguments that have spurred the Commission to
broaden the scope of application of the Directive on excise duties to
include other energy sources such as coal, natural gas and electricity.
The Commission's first concern seems to be winning acceptance for the
principle of taxation of these products, regardless of the rate, as a
first step towards compensating for the failure of the energy/CO2 tax
proposal. As mentioned earlier, even biofuels could be include in this
proposal, which would thus supersede Directive 92/81/EEC on the structure
of excise duties on mineral oils, that on excise duty rates (92/82/EEC)
and the draft Directive on excise duty reductions for biofuels (still held
up in the Council).

AUSTRALIA LIFTS EMBARGO ON URANIUM SHIPMENTS TO FRANCE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The Australian Government announced on October 21 that it would lift the
embargo on new deliveries of uranium imposed in 1988 in protest of French
nuclear tests in the Pacific. This decision came in response to France's
signing of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Australian Minster of Foreign
Affairs and Trade, Tim Fischer. The embargo covered new uranium contracts,
but not those signed before it took effect. Mr Fischer emphasised that
France's accession to the Treaty marked the fulfilment of promises it made
on January 29 to stop all nuclear testing. Australia's uranium export
policy prohibits sales of uranium for other than peaceful uses.

During the crisis sparked last year by French nuclear tests on Mururoa
Atoll, Australia's Labour Government refused to impose a total embargo on
shipments of uranium to France, explaining that such a measure would cost
Australia more than France. The decision to lift the embargo was
immediately condemned by environmentalists, who claimed that France had
not promised not to use Australian uranium for military purposes. "The
fact that the Australian Government seems ready to do anything to sell
Australian uranium is unfortunate", said Jim Downey, head of an Australian
conservation association, adding that France had not yet proved its good
faith on nuclear issues.

Australia originally imposed an embargo in 1983, lifted it in 1986 and
reapplied it in 1988. According to the Australian Uranium Information
Centre, Australia currently has orders for AUSD11 million (eight million
US Dollars) worth of non-enriched uranium, representing only 3% of
France's needs, but accounting for about 10% of Australia's exports.
Uranium Miner Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) sells 272 tonnes of
concentrated uranium oxide to France each year, at AUSD40,000
(USUSD30,400) per tonne, under a long-term contract with Electricite de
France (EDF). ERA's Director, Phillip Shirvington, indicated that the door
was now open for new exports, but that extensive negotiations were still
required. "This decision allows us to extend our contract with EDF when
the current one expires in the next century and to sign other contracts",
Mr Shirvington added.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION: ENERGY SECTOR PLANS UNDER 1997 WORK PROGRAMME

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

"1997 will be a watershed year marked by three major events: the
Inter-Governmental Conference, Economic and Monetary Union, the financial
package for post-1999 and enlargement", Jacques Santer told the European
Parliament, meeting in plenary in Strasbourg on October 22. The President
of the European Commission was presenting his institution's work programme
for 1997, along with a report on the implementation of the 1996 programme.
While the Commission's main priorities as the turn of the century nears
are growth and employment, development of a European model of society and
closer relations with third countries, actions are also foreseen in the
energy and environment fields. Mr Santer's presentation did not sway the
Parliament, however, which gave the programme a critical reception and
accused the Commission of legislative inertia.

Among the measures proposed specifically for the energy sector are a
proposal on the promotion of clean coal technology (CARNOT) and
communications on a renewable energy strategy, a cogeneration promotion
strategy, on the role of energy management in regions, cities and on
islands, on the part played by technology and strategy for energy RTD, and
on the harmonisation of nuclear transport conditions. The Commission also
plans to engage in negotiations on radioactive waste and Euratom accession
and revise legislation on compulsory oil stocks and on the price
transparency of crude oil and oil products. (See the list of planned
Commission actions below.)

I>"The Single Market has taken shape but it remains incomplete", the
Commission notes in its Work Programme. It therefore plans to work right
throughout 1997 to win the Council's agreement on several pending pieces
of legislation, including that on opening up the internal market for
natural gas. The Commission will put more pressure on the Member States to
speed up their transposition of Directives needed for the proper
functioning of the Internal Market. Rules on state aid will be assessed in
terms of their impact on employment. The Commission will also continue its
efforts to simplify legislation.

The Commission plans to propose measures to make companies better able to
compete, particularly in high-tech sectors; defend its Fifth Framework
Programme for Research and Technological Development; and take initiatives
to stimulate innovation at the conclusion of the process of consultation
on the Green Paper it unveiled this year.

As concerns the environment, apart from the revision of the Fifth Action
Programme - Towards Sustainable Development, the Commission wants to be a
"driving force" in preparations for the Conference to be held in 1997 as a
follow-up to the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992.

List of planned Commission actions in the energy, environmental protection
and research and development areas in 1997:

ENERGY

- Communication on a "renewable energy strategy"

- Proposal on the promotion of clean coal technology (CARNOT)

- Communication on a strategy for the promotion of co-generation

CEDEC CRITICISES ELECTRICITY DIRECTIVE COMMON POSITION

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The EU Council of Ministers' June 20 common position on the internal
electricity market Directive cannot be defended from an economic, social
or legal point of view, and it compromises the rights and interests of
distribution companies, the European Confederation of Public Communal
Energy Distributors (CEDEC) says. "The existing version of the Directive
leads to a division of the single electricity market in two: on the one
hand, a privileged group of 'eligible clients' that can freely choose
their supplier in Europe and negotiate their prices, and on the other
hand, clients that will remain tied to their current distributor and upon
whom prices will be imposed as in the past", CEDEC argues in its October
newsletter.

"In fact, it would be economically and socially inadmissible that the
advantages of liberalised electricity production and sales on European
markets benefit only large industrial consumers of electricity", while
small consumers are excluded from the advantages that increased
competition will bring, CEDEC continues. CEDEC groups national communal
energy distribution associations in Belgium, Germany, France, Italy and
Austria.

EU/VENEZUELA: EUROPEAN BUSINESSES ENCOURAGED TO INVEST

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

Venezuela is reforming its economy and European companies are welcome to
invest in several industries, including those in the energy sector. This
is the message the country is sending out through a series of seminars on
"Doing Business in Venezuela" being held this month in Amsterdam,
Brussels, Madrid, Milan and Padova as part of an effort to diversify
sources of investment and enhance the country's access to new markets.
"Venezuela is the best kept secret in Latin America", Luis Xavier
Grisanti, Ambassador to the EU, Belgium and Luxembourg told Europe Energy
on October 16. But with opportunities for foreign investors abounding and
seminars like the one in Brussels on October 14 attracting 115
participants from the financial, industrial and international services
sectors, the secret may not remain concealed for long.

The Ambassador said that potential investors are being attracted primarily
by the country's extensive privatisation programme and other open market
reforms such as the abolition of exchange and price controls - including
petrol and electricity price rises - liberalisation of interest rates and
the reduction of the fiscal deficit. These are being implemented as part
of a global macro-economic stabilisation programme, called "Agenda
Venezuela," that aims to help the country get fully back on its feet after
a serious financial crisis in 1994.

A long list of assets and companies up for privatisation by early 1997
includes several electric power systems, including the Nueva Esparta State
Power System, Energia Electrica de Barquisimeto (Enelbar) in the state of
Lara and the Enelven-Enelco power system in the state of Zulia. The gas,
petrochemical, coal and oil sectors are also being opened to foreign
investment; a first round of tenders for "share-risk contracts" in new
areas of oil exploration has already taken place, and bidding for
operational contracts for marginal wells is to be held in 1997. With
USD1.3 billion spent in 1994 on purchasing materials and equipment for the
oil industry, opportunities for companies providing goods and services
also exist.

The seminars, in which high-level officials such as Venezuela's Planning
Minister Teodoro Petkoff, Deputy Minister of Energy and Mines Evanan
Romero and Bank Deposit Guarantee Fund President Esther de Margulis have
participated, are being sponsored by the Government of Venezuela, the
European Commission and the National Council for Investment Promotion
(CONAPRI). A series of similar meetings is taking place in the United
States.

COMPETITION: VAN MIERT CONSIDERS FUTURE OF OIL SALES COMPETITION
EXEMPTIONS

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commissioner for Competition, Karel Van Miert, is considering
a proposal for a two-year extension of rules - which are due to expire at
the end of 1997 - that exempt exclusive supply and distribution agreements
in the oil and beer sectors from European Union competition rules under
Article 85.3 of the EU Treaty. The Commission said on October 16 that the
proposal was to avoid a "legal vacuum" that could occur if the existing
"block exemptions" from EU competition rules were to expire before
consultations on the Commission's Green Paper on the long-term future of
exclusive supply and distribution agreements, due to be published by early
1997, were concluded. The Green Paper, also known as the vertical
restraints paper, is already a year overdue.

The Regulations at stake cover tens of thousands of agreements by which a
supplier, on the one hand, appoints a reseller as his exclusive
distributor in a given area (Regulation 1983/83), and on the other hand, a
reseller agrees to buy all his products from one supplier only (Regulation
1984/83). These exemptions from normal EU competition rules currently
allow oil companies to make exclusive supply agreements with petrol
stations.

The Green Paper is expected to call for the review of agreements within
the oil, beer and perfume sectors and also to address the issue of
franchising, covered by a separate block exemption which expires at the
end of 1999. One solution which could be put forward in the Green Paper
would be to carry on with sectoral block exemptions. Another would be to
base exemptions on the market share of the company operating the
restrictive agreements. In the meantime, when Mr Van Miert makes a formal
proposal for the extension of the rules, his decision must be approved by
the full team of Commissioners.

The European oil industry, represented by Europia, is especially concerned
that if the block exemptions were rescinded, petrol distributors which now
benefit from acceptable exclusive purchasing or supply agreements could
suffer in a climate of increased uncertainty. In informal talks with the
Commission's Directorate-General responsible for Competition on the
preparation of the Green Paper, the industry has already indicated that
while it would like the legal certainty provided by Regulation 1984/83 to
continue, the regime could be improved. Europia suggested that the new
regime should allow a duration of 10 years or more for the exclusive
purchasing agreement, which would lead to adequate return on capital
employed, and the inclusion within the exclusive purchasing regime of
lubricants, company fuel card schemes and all-convenience store goods.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION TO CREATE ENERGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

The European Commission is likely to adopt by early November a Decision to
create an Energy Advisory Committee, as called for in its December 1995
Energy Policy White Paper, as part of an effort to establish an informal
but institutionalised dialogue with the energy sector and ensure its
support when new areas of action in the energy field are chosen. This
Committee will be expected to assist in identifying energy policy areas
where Commission action is deemed to be necessary, provide advice on the
means needed to implement Commission proposals and give opinions on these
proposals before they are finalised.

The Committee is to be composed of 31 representatives of energy producers,
distributors, consumers, unions, and associations dealing with the
protection of the environment. During the preparation of the White Paper,
all these interested parties had indicated to the Commission the priority
they place on dialogue and transparency in the formulation of EU energy
policy.

COGENERATION: NEW POLITICAL SUPPORT EXPRESSED AT CONFERENCE

from EUROPE ENERGY, 25 October 1996, No. 478

In a special report on the recent conference on Prospects and challenges
for Europe's cogeneration markets, freelance journalist Steve Hodgson,
writing for Cogen Europe, looks at how a new political momentum is
building toward a new cogeneration strategy, what elements Cogen Europe
thinks this strategy should contain, and what cogeneration's prospects are
in a liberalised electricity market.

Prospects for an EU cogeneration strategy have received a major boost from
Peter Scholten of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. Speaking at
Cogen Europe's annual conference in Brussels on October 10-11 (see last
issue of Europe Energy), Mr Scholten announced that the proposed strategy
will be on the agenda for the May 1997 Energy Council under the
forthcoming Dutch EU Council Presidency if the Communication from the
Commission on the subject is presented in time.

Earlier during the conference, Joanna Tachmintzis, a member of Energy
Commissioner Christos Papoutsis' Cabinet, said that Europe's cogeneration
industry is entering "a new phase in its development," and that new
cogeneration capacity will be an essential element of efforts to curb
Europe's CO2 emissions in the coming years.

She added that the prospects for cogeneration will boosted by both the
proposed internal electricity market Directive and by the Communication on
cogeneration from the Commission, which is due to be published early in
1997. This strategy will be framed to take account of both EU
environmental and energy policy objectives and could, said Ms Tachmintzis,
include an EU target for cogeneration, something for which Cogen Europe
has long been calling.

As well as setting a European target for cogeneration, Cogen Europe
believes that the strategy should also:

*provide ongoing monitoring of market barriers to cogeneration in each
country,

*prioritise cogeneration's position within the EU's carbon reduction
programmes, and

*establish cogeneration support programmes for central and eastern Europe.

Another major conclusion from the conference was that the liberalisation
of electricity markets currently taking place in Europe will aid the
development of decentralised cogeneration plant but may harm prospects for
existing city-wide cogeneration/district heating systems. Many national
electricity markets are already moving towards more competitive and
transparent structures, a trend which helps cogeneration and which Cogen
Europe supports.

The amount of cogeneration used in each country is a function of its
history, climate and level of industrialisation, but also of the
prevailing legal/regulatory/market framework. While only some 7% of
Europe's electricity is generated by cogeneration, three countries - the
Netherlands, Denmark and Finland - generate more than 30% in this way.
Cogen Europe suggests that a 30% share could be achieved across the
continent by 2010, providing ECU 140 billion of investment opportunities,
new jobs and massive CO2 cuts.

Announcing the preliminary results of a major Cogen Europe study at the
conference, UK and Danish consultants Ilex and Ramboll said that
liberalisation helps cogeneration in industry, buildings and small-scale
district heating schemes by allowing energy users to self-generate their
own power and by removing a number of market barriers. City-wide systems
may need protection in a more competitive environment.

Equally importantly, liberalisation promotes more progressive utility
thinking as well as structures, said Ilex/Ramboll, and increases customer
choice. Thus the UK energy markets, perhaps the most liberalised in the
EU, have helped cogeneration grow by 50% since the electricity industry
was first privatised in 1990.

Cogen Europe believes that, to be helpful to cogeneration, national
frameworks should include greater competition in electricity generation,
more open access to the transmission system and a service-oriented
distribution system. If these measures were accompanied by moves to
reflect environmental costs in energy prices, this would help cogeneration
begin to meet its enormous potential in Europe, both East and West.

Over 230 delegates attended the conference to learn about the latest moves
from Brussels and to hear presentations on the prospects for cogeneration
within 13 countries, among them 10 EU Member States, Hungary, Poland and
the Czech Republic. Cogen Europe was able to report that it now has 117
members, including a network of 11 national promotional organisations.
