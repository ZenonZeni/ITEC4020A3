<H3>How Current U.S. Encryption Policy Fails to Meet the Needs of American
Internet Users<BR>
<A NAME="intro"></A><BR>
I. Introduction and Overview</H3>
Good morning, my name is Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center
for Democracy and Technology (CDT). The Center is pleased to have this 
opportunity
to testify today. CDT is an independent, non-profit public interest policy
organization in Washington, D.C. The Center's mission is to develop and
implement public policies to protect and advance individual liberties and
democratic values in new digital communications media. The Center achieves
its goals through policy development, public education, and coalition building.
CDT also coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG),
an ad hoc coalition of more than 50 computer, communications, associations,
and public interest organizations working on communications privacy issues.
In the past, CDT and members of the Working Group have strongly opposed
the Administration's Clipper Chip proposals.<A NAME="overview"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A. Overview: Encryption Policy in the Internet Age</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
With the recent Federal court ruling in Philadelphia enjoining the 
Communications
Decency Act, the remaining major legal obstacle to the development of electronic
commerce is outdated U.S. encryption policies. The Administration's cryptography
policy, based upon a narrow national security perspective that ignores the
privacy needs of individual users, cannot form the sound basis for a secure
communications infrastructure. A cryptography policy without explicit privacy
protections will never gain the trust of users or be embraced by the 
international
marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
In the two years since the Senate last held hearings on encryption policy,
the looming crisis in privacy and security has become more urgent, yet remains
unresolved: 
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>The Internet Perspective</STRONG> -- U.S. encryption policy
has failed to account for the emergence of the Internet as a model for 
communications:<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>The Internet is not like the telephone system</STRONG> --
The Internet encompasses a range of social functions far beyond simple two-way
voice communication. These broad activities demand a heightened capacity
for users to protect their security and privacy online. The traditional
approach to wiretapping cannot simply be exported to this new medium.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>The Internet is a global, decentralized medium</STRONG> --
Efforts to impose unilateral national policies -- such as export controls
or key escrow proposals -- are unlikely to be accepted widely. Decentralized
user choice solutions to privacy problems are preferable to and more effective
than centralized government mandates.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>On the Internet, the Bill of Rights is a local ordinance</STRONG>
-- Constitutional guarantees offer no protection to U.S. citizens whose
communications regularly cross national borders. Policies should be designed
to protect Americans outside of the shelter of U.S. law.<BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI><STRONG>Current encryption policy fails to meet users' needs</STRONG>
-- Widely available strong encryption is essential if users are to ever
trust their private and sensitive information to the Global Information
Infrastructure (GII). Yet export controls and other policies have kept good
encryption tools out of the hands of everyday users and capped security
at a 40-bit key length that many experts judge to be &quot;inadequate 
protection.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#foot_1">1</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Administration encryption policy remains hostage to a law 
enforcement
and national security rationale that is outdated and unsubstantiated</STRONG>
-- National security arguments have been undermined by the increasing 
availability
of strong encryption outside of the United States. The law enforcement problem
posed by encryption is real, but narrowly focused around real-time surveillance
of electronic communications. The massive invasions of privacy and the high
cost of the Administration's export controls and key escrow policies cannot
be justified on these narrow and eroding grounds. 
</OL>
Congressional action is needed. Encryption policy is the weak link creating
a crisis in electronic commerce and individual privacy. Only Congress is
in a position to demand that law enforcement justify its policies. Only
Congress can act quickly to reverse the policies of the Administration.
CDT strongly commends those of you who have supported S.1726, the Protecting
Commerce Online in the Digital Era (PRO-Code) Act of 1996, authored by Senator
Burns, and S.1587, the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996, authored
by Senator Leahy. The Congress should act to immediately liberalize export
controls and provide American Internet users with the strong security and
privacy they so badly need.<A NAME="user"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>B. Internet User Involvement is Crucial</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
CDT is pleased to be here as part of these important Congressional efforts
to address the crisis that exists today in U.S. encryption policy. The Center
wishes to express its thanks to you, Mr. Chairman, to Senator Pressler,
Senator Wyden, and the other sponsors of S.1726 for your work in support
of Internet privacy and security, and to Senator Leahy, who has been a long-time
supporter of efforts to ease encryption controls. <BR>
<BR>
We are particularly concerned that the voice of Internet users be heard
in this forum. We are pleased to have been a part of the Committee's efforts
to solicit input from everyday computer users for this hearing, via the
World Wide Web. We are also pleased to be working with HotWired and Digex
to make this the first Senate hearing ever simulcast live over the Internet
-- making these proceedings accessible to millions worldwide. We commend
the Committee for reaching out to the growing community of computer users
who care deeply about this issue.<A NAME="pub_policy"></A>

<P>
<H3>II. Communications Privacy in the Age of the Internet: Public Policy
Principles</H3>
For years encryption policy has been driven, substantially unchallenged,
by the needs of the national security establishment. With the arrival of
the personal computer and the Internet, that narrow focus is plainly no
longer acceptable. The policies that may have been appropriate for the Age
of the Mainframe Computer will not meet the needs of individuals and society
in the Age of the Internet. We suggest that any policy that addresses privacy
and security on the Internet should do so in light of the following policy
principles: 
<UL>
<LI>The Internet is not like the telephone system. 
<LI>The Internet is a global medium: Decentralized user choices are preferable
to centralized government mandates. 
<LI>On the Internet, the Bill of Rights is a local ordinance.<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_2">2</A></SUP>
</UL>
Application of these principles to today's encryption policy logjam leads
to the inescapable conclusion that fundamental change is needed. S.1726
has CDT's full support for its effort to move this policy debate beyond
the Cold War-era Mainframe model, into the Age of the Internet.<A NAME=
"phone"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A. The Internet Is Not Like The Telephone System<BR>
</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The Internet is therefore a unique and wholly new medium
of worldwide human communication.&quot; Court's Findings of Fact, &#182;81,
ALA v. Dept. of Justice<SUP><A HREF="#foot_3">3</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>
If there is one truth that policymakers have learned about the Internet
in the last year, it is that the Internet is not just another telephone
system. Current encryption policy is justified, in part, by law enforcement
arguments that they must continue to conduct electronic surveillance in
the same manner as they are able to on the telephone network. But efforts
to simplisticly apply assumptions about wiretapping from the telephone system
to the Internet risk grave threats to individual privacy. In a similar vein,
congressional attempts in the Communications Decency Act to impose content-based
restrictions on speech from the phone system onto the Internet have recently
been harshly rebuffed by the Federal courts.<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_4">4</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
From a constitutional privacy perspective, the single most significant 
difference
between the Internet and traditional telephone service is the vast array
of uses that the Internet currently serves, as well the even larger range
of new applications bound to come in the future. The Internet is not simply
a new-fangled digital telephone. Rather, Internet services will likely 
facilitate
the following important social functions now or in the near future: 
<UL>
<LI>wallet 
<LI>first class mail envelope 
<LI>carrier of credit card transaction 
<LI>face-to-face contact with a bank or a merchant 
<LI>public library 
<LI>neighborhood bookstore 
<LI>movie theater 
<LI>doctor's office 
<LI>town square, coffee shop, union hall, political clubhouse, or community
center where we discuss politics 
<LI>local art museum 
<LI>romantic night spot for intimate conversations 
</UL>
The Internet is much more than simply a means of instantaneous communications
like telephone conversations, which are short and largely support other
activities that transpire in the physical world. Instead, the Internet is
itself a platform where all of the activities listed above can take place.
On the Internet, people do business, engage in politics, conduct intimately
private interactions with health care professionals, participate in culture,
and even fall in love. The vast breadth of activities conducted online demand
that individuals have the greatest ability possible to protect their privacy
and ensure their security. These activities also demand greater protection
against government intrusions on individual privacy, free expression, and
freedom of association.<BR>
<BR>
The privacy protections embodied in the U.S. law today are the product of
a long and thorough debate in which the concerns of law enforcement were
aired and carefully weighed against the rights of citizens. Congress should
not allow law enforcement concerns to unravel this delicate balance by imposing
the wiretapping paradigm on this new medium without careful deliberation.<BR>
<A NAME="case"></A>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>Case Study: Application of wiretapping to the virtual corporation
challenges Fourth Amendment principles<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
Wiretapping and other electronic surveillance has always been recognized
as an exception to the fundamental Fourth Amendment prohibition against
secret searches. Even with a valid search warrant, law enforcement agents
must &quot;knock and announce&quot; their intent to search a premises before
proceeding. Failure to do so violates the Fourth Amendment. Until now, the
law of search and seizure has made a sharp distinction between, on the one
hand, seizures of papers and other items in a person's physical possession,
and on the other hand, wiretapping of communications. Seizure of papers
or personal effects must be conducted with the owner's knowledge, upon 
presentation
of a search warrant. Only in the exceptional case of wiretapping -- and
with the heightened procedural and substantive requirements that accompany
a wiretap request -- may a person's privacy be invaded by law enforcement
without simultaneously informing that person. <BR>
<BR>
In the era where people work for &quot;virtual corporations&quot; and conduct
personal and political lives in &quot;cyberspace,&quot; the distinction
between communication of information and storage of information is increasingly
vague. The organization in which one works may constitute a single virtual
space, but be physically dispersed. The papers and files of the organization
or individual may be moved within the organization by means of 
telecommunications
technology. Instantaneous access to encryption keys, without prior notice
to the communicating parties, thus present a much broader intrusion. Such
access may well constitute a secret search, if the target is a virtual 
corporation
or an individual whose &quot;papers&quot; are physically dispersed.<BR>
<A NAME="global"></A>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>B. The Internet Is A Global Medium: Decentralized User Solutions
Are Preferable To Centralized Government Mandates</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
On of the Internet's great strengths is the ease with which it spans the
globe: information flows as effortlessly from New York to Nairobi as from
Washington, DC to West Virginia. Moreover, a communication from New York
to Nairobi might travel through the United Kingdom and four countries one
day, but through France and five other countries the next day. For this
reason, national controls are unlikely to work in a global medium like the
Internet. Privacy solutions should not rely on centralized policies and
control, but instead should be oriented towards the user and robust enough
to exist in the highly decentralized environment that characterizes the
Internet.<BR>
<BR>
The rapid pace of Internet development has occurred with some important
government support, but entirely without the interference of the traditional
regulatory process. The flexibility of the Internet community in developing
new solutions to meet user needs has been nothing short of astonishing.
Yet the one area in which the innovative energy of the Internet has been
most stifled has been in the area of security and privacy. Just as we cannot
expect the United States government to have anticipated the architecture
of the World Wide Web, so it is foolhardy to expect that the national security
establishment of the United States can anticipate and provide for the security
needs of all Internet users. S.1726 properly gets the government out of
the business of controlling this vital part of the emerging information
infrastructure. <A NAME="rights"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>C. On the Internet, the Bill of Rights is a Local Ordinance</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Both data security solutions against private intrusion and privacy protections
against unwarranted government surveillance must be suited to the global
nature of the Net. Good data security demands strong encryption to foil
threats wherever they are in the world. And good data security and privacy
policies must recognize that the Bill of Rights in the United States 
Constitution
is nothing more than a local law.<BR>
<BR>
United States Constitutional protections against unreasonable search and
seizure offer little protection to U.S. citizens whose Internet communications
regularly cross borders. Foreign governments and others can intercept these
messages without the knowledge of the senders, and beyond the ability of
the United States government to protect the privacy rights of its citizens.
For similar reasons, the key escrow agents called for in recent Administration
policy proposals would create an enormous new vulnerability for Internet
users -- both from private data intruders and from governments which may
not have adequate law enforcement safeguards or may not accord the same
privacy protections to United States citizens.<BR>
<BR>
The global nature of the Internet thus demands that users have access to
the highest quality encryption technology. We strongly agree with the many
individuals, fellow privacy advocates, and industry leaders who praise S.1726's
effort to lift export controls and allow the market to provide the security
and privacy that global Internet users need.<A NAME="locks"></A><BR>

<H3>III. The Need for Locks and Keys on the GII: Users Need Encryption</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;On balance, the advantages of more widespread use of 
cryptography
outweigh the disadvantages.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#foot_5">5</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>
The use of encryption is an inevitable and essential part of life online.
As the National Research Council found in its long-awaited encryption White
Paper, not only do users need encryption, but it is actually in America's
national interest to promote the widespread use of good cryptography.<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_6">6</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
A secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infrastructure (GII) is
essential to promote economic growth and meet the needs of Information Age
society. Developing that secure and trusted GII requires strong, flexible,
widely-available cryptography. Individuals need to have confidence in the
GII to realize the full democratic potential of free association and personal
communications. Competitive businesses need to protect proprietary information
as it flows across insecure global communications networks. <BR>
<BR>
In recent months the public has been made increasingly aware of the dangers
of computer crime and the vulnerability of current cryptography implementations.
Rapid advances in the speed and sophistication of hardware and software
have laid siege to the 40-bit key systems currently approved for export,
as well as the popular 56-bit DES algorithm.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_7">7</A></SUP>
If we are to maintain the trust of the public and realize the full potential
of the GII, individual users will need widely available good encryption
to protect themselves online: 
<UL>
<LI>Individuals need encryption in order to trust the GII with confidential
data such as financial transactions, medical records, or private 
communications.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Businesses need encryption to provide individuals with privacy protection
and to protect proprietary information as it flows across vulnerable global
networks. Moreover, businesses need good encryption to protect the growing
stores of personal information that they accumulate about individuals --
such as medical, insurance, credit, or financial records.<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_8">8</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Government users need encryption. Government itself needs good encryption
to protect sensitive military, law enforcement, financial, or private citizen
information.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_9">9</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
<LI>America needs encryption to promote national security and prevent crime.
The widespread use of strong encryption is widely considered one of our
best defenses in the battle to protect America's information infrastructure
from information warfare and other security threats. It is ironic that the
very players within the Administration who should be promoting the use of
encryption to promote national security and prevent crime online are actively
working to stop it. FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in the Senate this
Spring about the massive losses attributed to industrial espionage in this
country, estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars. CIA Director
John Deutch has testified just yesterday about the increasing vulnerability
of our financial, utility, government, and telecommunications information
infrastructure to &quot;information terrorists&quot; and other bad actors.
Yet the lack of strong encryption use today has left computer users vulnerable
to the prying eyes of hackers, corporate competitors, and even foreign 
governments.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_10">10</A></SUP>
</UL>
The GII will not fully develop without widely available and strong cryptography.
The lack of any international standard for strong cryptography has already
hindered the deployment of highly secure systems worldwide. Moreover, national
and regional governments are increasingly considering regulations on the
use of encryption. Such actions threaten to create a patchwork of international
regulations which would hinder the deployment of secure global communications
and leave users without the security and privacy they need.<BR>
<BR>
In this context, the sole focus on national security needs embodied in the
Administration's cryptography policies is unlikely to meet the needs of
GII users. By maintaining 40-bit key length restrictions on exports, these
policies leaves users hamstrung with insecure systems. By proposing unattractive
interoperability restrictions and minimal privacy protections for key escrow
systems, these policies discourage the deployment of secure systems in U.S.
products. Rather than being seamlessly incorporated into popular products,
secure communications will remain out of reach for less sophisticated GII
users. The resulting loss of security will have a chilling effect on the
development of electronic commerce and the information infrastructure as
the privacy and security needs of users are not met.<A NAME="naked"></A><BR>

<STRONG>-- <FONT SIZE=+1>The Failure of Administration Encryption Policy:
Users' Needs Go Unmet</FONT></STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Current national policy is not adequate to support the
information security requirements of an information society.&quot;<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_12">12</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>
Current Administration encryption policy has failed to meet the needs of
computer users. Export controls and other government policies keep good
encryption out of the hands of users. These policies act to coerce the domestic
market for encryption. The 40-bit key length encryption available under
these policies is widely viewed by experts as inadequate. Worse, the export
controls are intrusive and ineffective at meeting their stated national
security goals. U.S. encryption policy is in a state of crisis, with users
unable to get the privacy because of unsupportable national security and
law enforcement rationale. Moreover, the Administration's Clipper Chip and
subsequent policy proposals have barely acknowledged privacy concerns in
any meaningful way, and have been greeted with distaste and scorn by the
marketplace and the public.<BR>
<BR>
Current Administration policy restricts the export of &quot;strong&quot;
encryption hardware or software products with keys greater than 40 bits
long (the length of the &quot;keys&quot; indicates the security of a system).
Many experts believe that 40 bit security is woefully inadequate.<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_13">13</A></SUP>
Export controls actually keep domestic users from getting good encryption.
Most U.S. software and hardware companies have been held hostage as they 
try to make their domestic products interoperable with and subject to the
same restrictions as their exportable products. <STRONG>The result is a
government policy that hurts American businesses and individuals:</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>It hurts individuals</STRONG> by not allowing them to choose
the encryption systems that best meet their security needs. A recent study
by a panel of renowned cryptographers found that the systems currently 
exportable
under government policies &quot;offer virtually no protection from brute-force
attacks.&quot;<A HREF="#foot_14"><SUP>14</SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>It hurts U.S. industry</STRONG> by not allowing companies to
provide secure products in the face of strong foreign competitors who are
not restricted by export controls. A recent report by the CEOs of 13 large
American technology companies concluded that the American computer industry
could lose up to $60 billion annually by the year 2000 due to these export
controls.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_15">15</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>It doesn't even meet the needs of national security.</STRONG>
The Software Publishers Association has documented hundreds of foreign 
encryption
products already widely available abroad. Criminals, terrorists, and foreign
governments will always have access to good encryption; it is law-abiding
citizens who sacrifice their privacy under current law. 
</UL>
Recent Administration proposals would only allow the export of moderately
stronger encryption, and then only with &quot;key escrow&quot; restrictions
to guarantee U.S. government access to individuals' keys -- restrictions
which are bound to fail in the competitive international marketplace. <A
NAME="admin"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="25%"></CENTER>
<P>
<H3>V. Putting the Administration's Arguments in a Box: Law Enforcement
Has Not Made It's Case</H3>
Law enforcement has been unable to justify massive losses of privacy it
proposes in return for minor gains in surveillance capabilities. The law
enforcement problem posed by encryption is real, but narrowly focused around
real-time surveillance of electronic communications. The massive invasion
of privacy and high cost of the Administration export controls and key escrow
cannot be justified by the law enforcement's last, hopeless grasp to expand
their capabilities is an area where those capabilities are already largely
gone.<BR>
<BR>
Law enforcement faces a real, but narrowly focused, problem with encryption.
The vast majority of encrypted information will be accessible to law enforcement
by legal process. Stored information, corporate and business information,
and even much electronic communication will be largely available to law
enforcement through similar legal process available today (See Figure 1
below): 
<OL>
<LI>Stored business information -- Stored corporate records and business
information, encrypted for security and privacy purposes, represents a large
part of the use of encryption and will be almost completely accessible to
law enforcement using the same sorts of court orders, warrants, and even
subpoena processes that are available today to access similar unencrypted
data.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Stored information by individuals -- Will be similarly available by
legal process, just as it is today. In certain narrow circumstances, access
to encrypted information may be thwarted by assertion of a Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Business communications -- Business communications will be largely 
accessible
to law enforcement. Today, electronic communications almost always become
stored information at one end or the other, and often both, and often as
plaintext. (For example, consider the instructive example of the archived
email in the Bush Administration). Such stored information will be readily
available to law enforcement as noted above. Thus, most communications will
be accessible --<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI>As data stored, often in plaintext, by communicating parties and available
via court order;<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Through stored decryption keys available via court order; or<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Through other kinds of authorized surveillance.<BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI>Individual communications -- Similarly to business communications, the
bulk of individual communications will be accessible to law enforcement
through legal process in some manner. Fifth Amendment privileges for individuals
may protect some of these communications. 
</OL>
The remaining problem for law enforcement can be narrowed to the real-time
interception of communications without any notice to the party under 
surveillance.
While this represents a problem for law enforcement, it is a narrow problem.
There are currently only on the order of 1100 wiretaps conducted by law
enforcement in the U.S. each year.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_16">16</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
The widespread use of compression algorithms, a vast array of text, audio,
and video applications, and even 40-bit encryption have already made real-time
electronic interception dramatically more difficult. The widespread use
of strong encryption by our more sophisticated national enemies makes many
of those interceptions impossible. The days of a vast positive signals 
intelligence
operation are numbered, with or without U.S. export controls. We must find
ways to help law enforcement and national security to adjust to this new
world, without limiting effective privacy for individuals and businesses
on the GII.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the information economy presents new and powerful tools and 
opportunities
for law enforcement. Online interaction leaves a detailed trail of electronic
transactions, credit card purchases, online communications, and Web-based
clickstream data presenting new traffic analysis opportunities. This information
offers law enforcement unprecedented new tools to obtain evidence of criminal
activity. The balance of power in an online world is tilting further towards
law enforcement and away from individual liberty. Encryption may represent
one of the rare opportunities to reclaim individual liberty in the face
of the steady erosion of privacy and individual autonomy brought on by 
technology
and the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
The federal government is granted the ability to monitor a specific telephone
line. It has never been prospectively guaranteed the ability to intercept
all communications of all individuals, and understand them. Wiretap targets
have always been able to use other phones, or speak in unintelligible code.
More importantly, the ability to hear a specific phone conversation is not
nearly as invasive as the ability to intercept, without notice or consent,
the full panoply of life online including health records, financial 
transactions,
online entertainment, intimate letters and conversations. Law enforcement
has been unable to justify this new, unwarranted expansion of surveillance
capabilities sought through the control of encryption technologies.<BR>

<H3>VI. Conclusion</H3>
Current U.S. encryption policy fails to recognize the needs of users and
the changes brought on by the Internet Age. The Internet is not like a phone
system, so the extension of wiretapping authority to the Internet is 
inappropriate.
The Internet is a global medium, so centralized control schemes like current
U.S. encryption policy are likely to be ineffective. And the Internet makes
U.S. Constitutional protections a local ordinance, so U.S. encryption policy
should seek to guarantee the privacy and liberty of Americans in their 
communications
outside of the United States. <BR>
<BR>
In the current policy standoff between eroding law enforcement arguments
and the emerging and acute privacy and security needs of the Information
Age, Congressional action is needed. Only Congress is in the position today
to change U.S. encryption policy and get Americans the privacy and security
tools they need. The private sector cannot do it. The Administration will
not do it. The courts may do it, but not without a protracted struggle.
Congress must act. CDT supports the legislative approaches embodied in S.1726,
S.1587, and H.R. 3011. The Congress should act to immediately liberalize
export controls and provide Americans on the Internet with the strong security
and privacy they so badly need.<A NAME="footnotes"></A><BR>
