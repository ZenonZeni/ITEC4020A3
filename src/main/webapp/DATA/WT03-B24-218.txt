<B>Facilities:</B><BR>
<I>Head Office;</I><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The site covers 19 acres. Y-shaped main building has four stories including one basement. Annexes are for blood plasma products for Veternary, for the research of Avian leucosis and for management. These buildings have totally 8.4 acres. They provide the space for research production, quaility control, marketing and administration. Most of the facilities are centrally controlled having an integrated system.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I>Kikuchi Research Center;</I><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The site covers 34.6 acres on the foot of Mt. Aso. Research building has six stories including one basement. Annexes are for recombinant vaccine products, for pathology and for management. The Research Center is steadily becoming the center of our research and development activities and, in parallel with this, we are working to expand the range of our expertise in the field of biotechnology.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<I>Aso Laboratory;</I><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The site covers 114,000 square meter on a slope of Mt. Aso, in Aso National Park. The laboratory keeps horses for immunization against bacterial toxins, snake venoms, etc. It also has facilities for raising SPF animals, e.g. chicken, duck and swine. These SPF animals as well as SPF eggs are provided for research and production of various vaccines.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>History:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1945: Founded as The Chemo-Sero-Therapeutic Research Institute on the instigation of Toyoichi Ohtawara, M.D., D.M.Sc., Professor of Kumamoto Medical College, and contributed to the preventive medicine by providing biological products.<P>

<B>Date Established:</B> December, 1945<P>

<B>Legal Form:</B> Japanese Research Foundation <P>

<B>Corporate Overview:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For achieving fulfilness of the principle of foundation, a number of reaserch developments for new biologics are conducted adapting every social demand.
Main research field is consisted of applied microbiology and immunology covering the development of immunoprophylactics, such as vaccines, toxoids and antibody preparations, diagnostic reagents, therapeutic plasma fractions and so forth for human or animal use. The reseach activity was actually originated on preventive medicine and currently its expansion has been desired according to the alteration of medical and social manifestations. The research, in consequence, is increasing its activity year and year, rapidly applying the recent progress of gene- and bio-engineering.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The site covers 34.6 acres. The Research Center is equipped with the most advanced technology and facilities and has become a center for research on gene recombination and cell fusion.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B>Production:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Improvement of manufacturing processes and introduction of new technologies are always done to wake the assurance of safety, efficacy and quality of the product.
Vaccines, antitoxins and antivenoms are produced for human and animal use. Blood plasma products, such as albumin, immunoglobulin and coagulation factors, and furthermore diagnostic reagents are also produced. An expansion of manufacturing facilities was completed in 1981, which increased the capacity of plasma fractionation.
These manufacturing facilities assure conformance to Current Good Manufacturing Practices.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B>Blood Plasma Products:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>High quality products such as Human albumin, Venilon, Confact F, Novact M, Bolheal etc. are manufactured in the well equipped and automated new plant which assure conformance to Current Good Manufacturing Practices.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B>Vaccines and Antitoxins for Human Use:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Vaccines and antitoxins, such as Hepatitis A vaccine, Hepatitis B vaccine, influenza vaccine, Japanese encephalitis vaccine and Habu antivenom are manufactured as the measures for preventive medicine.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B>Vaccines and Diagnostic Reagents for Vaterinary Use:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Vaccines and diagnostic reagents for poultry, canine, swine, bovine,fish and equine use are manufactured in main laboratory. SPF eggs and animals produced at Aso laboratory are provided for quality control test and for production of various vaccines.</BLOCKQUOTE>
