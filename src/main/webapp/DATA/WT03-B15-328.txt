The combination of Washington Construction and MK heavy civil construction operations has
created a preeminent constructive force with the experience, reputation for quality performance,
highly skilled cadre of professionals and financial strength to compete for, win and successfully
complete large and complex infrastructure projects anywhere in the world.<p>
This revitalized MK Heavy Civil Construction Group is one of the largest organizations of its
kind in the United States, with proven operational expertise in constructing highways, bridges
and tunnels; airport and marine port facilities; rail lines; and water-distribution and storage
systems.<p>
Two recent projects epitomize the management skills, resourcefulness, responsiveness to
client needs and can-do attitude that is found in all of the group’s undertakings.
In 1994, following the devastating Northridge earthquake in southern California,
Washington Construction went to work for the California Department of Transportation
on the emergency repair of a heavily damaged critical freeway interchange in Los Angeles.
After mobilizing rapidly, crews worked 24 hours a day, seven days per week.
The project was completed in just 100 days, 36 days ahead of schedule -- restoring a
vital transportation link for hundreds of thousands of citizens.<p>
Earlier this year, MK was called on by the Oregon Department of Transportation to repair
two mountain highways decimated by heavy flooding. An MK team was on the job within
hours of the first call from ODOT and worked around the clock to open numerous slides that
had blocked a highway and isolated two small towns. MK then moved on to badly damaged
Highway 6, a key route to coastal recreation areas. After extensive roadbed repairs were
undertaken, this project was completed in less than two months, more than a month earlier
than expected.<p>
While these projects were relatively small and short in duration, the performance that
produced successful results applies to major projects, such as the $384-million Eastside
Reservoir Project in southern California that was awarded to a Washington Construction
joint-venture earlier this year.<p>
The group’s skills at completing complex projects on time and within budget are augmented
by project development and financing capabilities in public-private partnerships or in
association with commercial clients.<p>
An example of the group’s overall abilities is the E-470 beltway project in Denver. MK served
as an agent for the E-470 Public Highway Authority to develop and implement a plan of finance
to fund all of the costs of the project to build two major segments of the beltway that will
connect Denver with the city’s new international airport.<p>
Following MK’s successful development and implementation of the financing plan, the
Authority awarded an MK-led limited liability company, a $321-million contract to design and
build the two segments, a 29-mile-long project that will take 46 months to complete.
Toll roads and projects similar in scope to E-470 will continue as one of the group’s primary
markets worldwide. MK and a joint-venture associate recently were selected by the
Commonwealth Transportation Board of Virginia to finance, design, construct and operate
a connector road near Richmond that is expected to cost in excess of $250 million.<p>
One of the strengths Washington Construction brings to the merger is highway and bridge
construction, especially in California where Washington has been a dominant force for years.
Among present projects are sections of the earthquake-damaged Cypress Freeway in
Oakland for $166 million, a $48-million interchange project in San Diego and a $32-million
freeway widening job in San Bernardino.<p>
Another area of considerable focus is the Middle East where MK already has a strong
presence. Among recent projects in the region are several water-resource jobs in Egypt,
including wastewater-treatment plants at Ismailia near the Suez Canal and at Port Said
on the Mediterranean coast.<p>
Marine construction is an MK specialty and the group recently completed the $230-million
Third Harbor Tunnel, an underwater tube tunnel in Boston Harbor for a four-lane highway
connecting the city with Logan International Airport. The tunnel was selected as the Outstanding
Civil Achievement by the American Society of Civil Engineers.<p>
