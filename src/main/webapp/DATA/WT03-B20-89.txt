<H1> Radionuclide Composition of the  Chernobyl-4 Reactor Core. </H1>
<HR>
At present the radionuclide inventory of the  reactor core  is  calculated  with  the  help  of special  computer programs, as far as physical processes of nuclide  formation and  their  characteristics  are  well  known.  For  each particular  reactor  design,  knowing  fuel  composition and parameters   characterizing   time   variation   of    power generation,   this   problem   has   sufficiently   accurate solution. Calculation error depends on particular situation  and  the  radionuclide  type. For 
instance, for calculations made in <A HREF = "sources.html#9">[9]</A> this  error is about 5%  for Cs-137 and 20% for  Pu-236.  In  <A HREF = "sources.html#9">[9]</A> the radionuclide  inventory of the  core  at  the  accidental  moment  is  not presented in explicit form.  However, as far as it presents the  absolute value  of  the  release  of  basic  radionuclides  (with the estimate  of  error  +50%)  and  their  part with respect to 
activity of nuclides in  the reactor, the core  inventory at the  accidental  moment  can  be  easily  reconstructed   by calculations,  and  this  was  done  in <A HREF = "sources.html#18">[18]</A> (<A HREF = "#coretable">Table at the end of current topic</A>). The authors  of <A HREF = "sources.html#1"> [1]</A>  used  in  their  calculations the averaged value burn-up equal to 10.3 MW*day/kg of uranium.  There  is a  number  of  later   works,  for  instance, <A HREF = "sources.html#
12">[12,  14, 16]</A>, the  authors  of  which  calculate  the  same   radionuclide inventory with  different accuracy. 
<P> 
There are  no  serious differences in  the general  approach. However, in a 
number of works made soon after the accident, their authors had  to use 
approximate  initial data,  because they  had no accurate data  on  fuel 
burn-up  and  enrichment. Thus, employees of Bremen  university sampled  soil  in  the  region of Munchen, 
measured the  ratio of  activity of  reference isotopes  and estimated  the  average  fuel  burn-up  at the moment of the accident as  (12.85-0.15) MW*day/kg <A HREF = "sources.html">[13]</A>. The  authors from the Livermore  Laboratory <A HREF = "sources.html#16">[16]</A>  used underestimated  data on fuel burn-up  and time  of reactor  operation This  explains somewhat   lower   results   as   compared   with  <A HREF = "sources.html#1">[1,  12]</A>. Specialists  of  the  USSR  hydro
meteorological service <A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14]</A> relied mainly  on the  data of  <A HREF = "sources.html#1">[1]</A>, but  corrected some  of them with the results of their own field measurements.   The most accurate value of average burn-up is presented  in <A HREF = "sources.html#12">[12]</A> and is 10.9 MW*day/kg. It is essential that there  were fuel  assemblies  with  different  burn-up  in  the reactor. Therefore,  the  usage  of  the  average  burn-up  value for calculation 
without   accounting   for   nonlinearity of radionuclide formation  in separate  assemblies also  causes considerable  inaccuracy.  These  processes  of   individual burn-up  and  generation  of  radionuclides  in each of 1659 fuel assemblies  were taken  into account  only in  the work "Fuel in the reactor of  unit 4 at the Chernobyl  NPP" <A HREF = "sources.html#12">[12]</A>, which   gives   the   most   accurate,   to   our   opinion, characteristics  of  radionuclide  inventory  of  the 
 core. Unfortunately,  this  work  considers  only the inventory of basic   long-lived   isotopes.    Further   refinement of calculations connected with accounting for inhomogeneity  of neutron  field  in  the  reactor  weakly  told on the values presented in  <A HREF = "#coretable">table placed below</A>,  excluding the  data on  inventory of transuranium elements.
