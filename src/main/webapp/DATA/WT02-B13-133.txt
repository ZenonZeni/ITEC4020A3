<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Between 1971 and 1986, the US debated what to do about illegal immigration
against a backdrop whose metaphor was that illegal aliens displaced American
workers and depressed their wages by working "hard and scared."  This labor
market discussion was inconclusive, largely because case studies that found
that illegal aliens displaced Americans and depressed their wages could not be
confirmed in econometric studies that found few or no such effects in the
cities and states with the most immigrants, suggesting that any negative labor
market effects of immigrants were very localized.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>One reason why there were few negative effects of immigrants detected
during the 1980s was that the economies of the states that attracted the most
immigrants--California, Texas, and Florida--grew rapidly, taking the edge off
of any labor market effects of illegal immigrants because Americans were
displaced.  In the end, the rationale for IRCA in 1986 was that illegal
immigration is illegal, and that the back door of illegal immigration should be
closed in order to keep the front door open.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Today the debate over illegal immigration has changed.  The new emphasis is
on the PUBLIC costs and benefits of legal and illegal immigrants--how much do
the services provided to them cost (and which level of government pays for
them), how much do immigrants pay in taxes, and to which level of government do
these taxes flow.  There is agreement that the taxes paid by immigrants tend to
flow to the federal government, while the costs of the services they consume
are paid for by state and local taxes (MN, May, 1994).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There is disagreement on the amounts of taxes paid and the costs of
services provided, but, once again, perhaps the most important question cannot
yet be answered--how will the balance of taxes paid and the cost of services
change over time?</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigrant Catch-up<i></i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>The first studies of immigrant economic integration were generally
optimistic. Economist Barry Chiswick found that the motivation etc that
encouraged people to move across borders also helped them to catch up and earn
more within about 15 years than US-born people with similar levels of education
.  These studies were based on 1970 and 1980 data, so they reflected the
experiences of immigrants who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s.  During the
1980s, studies by economist George Borjas found that the average level of
education of immigrants was declining and, with less education, their
probability of achieving ever-higher US incomes fell.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The 1990 US Census demonstrated that the immigrants who arrived during the
1980s were significantly different than the US population.  When ranked by
education, the immigrant characteristic most likely to indicate economic
success has a barbell or hourglass shape--they are more likely than natives to
have a college education, AND they are more likely than natives to have less
than a high-school education.  US-born citizens, when arrayed by their years of
education, have more of a diamond-shape, with most Americans in the middle at
the high-school graduate level.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration and Welfare </tt><p>
<tt>According to the 1990 Census of Population, the 20 million legal and
illegal immigrants were 8.5 percent of the US population.  Almost half of these
immigrants arrived during the 1980s, and almost two-thirds of the 1980s
immigrants arrived in the second half of the decade.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US spent $300 billion on means-tested assistance in 1992, and an
estimated $5 trillion on cash payments (AFDC) to poor families, food stamps,
and similar programs since 1965.  Since not all of these programs determine
accurately the legal status of recipients, it is very difficult to determine
whether a higher percentage of immigrants or natives are and will be receiving
"public assistance."  An analysis of 1990 Census data by George Borjas found
that slightly more households headed by foreign-born persons received welfare
assistance, and these immigrant households received a disproportionate share of
welfare payments in 1989.</tt><p>
<tt><i></i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>However, welfare dependence varies between immigrant subgroups.
Only refugees and elderly legal immigrants tend to go on welfare upon their
arrival or as soon as they are eligible.  Relatively few non-refugees who
arrived in the 1980s--many of whom were illegal aliens who became legal
residents in the 1986-87 amnesty--received public assistance in 1989, in part
because many were ineligible when the 1990 Census of Population asked them
about their income the year before.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Because so many of the immigrants included in the 1990 Census of Population
were not eligible for welfare assistance, "snapshot" analysts must be very
careful about making over time projections of welfare dependence on the basis
of one-year's data.  For example, it is true that Census data show that poor
Mexican immigrant households in California are much less likely to be on
welfare than poor US-born Mexican-American households, but it is not clear
whether the immigrants' lower welfare usage in 1989 reflected their
ineligibility OR an anti-welfare immigrant culture, as some have
claimed.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The data support the conclusion of demographer Frank Bean of the University
of Texas --a rising number of poor immigrant households during the 1980s did
NOT translate into a proportional increase the number of welfare recipients in
1989.  Some extend this to argue that the US and California can receive poor
immigrants and not see its welfare rolls increase.  About 41 percent of the
native-born poor Mexican households received public assistance, versus 18
percent of the poor immigrant households headed by persons born in Mexico.
[The number of <u>poor</u> immigrant households in California doubled during
the 1980s to 509,000, and 20 percent of them (104,000) received public
assistance, versus 26 percent (230,000) of the poor non-immigrant households].
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, no one knows whether these "snapshot" studies will be indicative
of the relationship between poor immigrants and welfare in the 1990s.  It seems
clear that eligibility restrictions, among other things, prevented most poor
immigrants from immediately getting public assistance.  The exceptions are
refugees and the elderly, who do go on welfare at relatively high rates when
they become eligible.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The effect of newly-legalized aliens on welfare rates may be significant,
since higher percentages of immigrants who arrived before 1980 are on welfare
than 1980s arrivals from countries in which the largest numbers of persons were
legalized in the 1987-88 amnesty (newly-legalized aliens were generally not
eligible for welfare in 1989, the Census year for income data).  For example,
13 percent of the Mexicans who arrived before 1980 were on welfare in 1989,
versus 11 percent of all Mexican immigrants in the US in 1990, 10 percent of
the El Salvadorans who arrived before 1980, versus seven percent, and 30
percent of the pre-1980 Dominicans, versus 28 percent.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Countries from which large numbers of refugees came to the US have a
pattern of declining welfare dependence.  Refugees are eligible for welfare
upon their arrival, and 26 percent of all Vietnamese immigrants, but only 16
percent of pre-1980 Vietnamese immigrants, received welfare in 1989.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Snapshot data from the Census cannot answer the really important question:
will poor immigrants get public assistance after they are in the US long enough
to be eligible for benefits?  Americans clearly worry that as poor immigrants
become  eligible for welfare, they will apply for benefits.  According to the
Los Angeles Times, three-fourths of California voters support that Save our
State initiative that is likely to go before voters in November 1994--it would
cut off most welfare benefits to undocumented residents.  Half of those polled
would support preventing illegal children from attending public schools.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Poor immigrants are entitled by law and court decisions to a number of
welfare benefits, so that, in many cases, changes would have to be made in
order to deny them benefits.  The major three programs that provide benefits to
illegal aliens are public education (Head Start, public school education from
grades K through 12, and school meal subsidies), WIC food coupons, and
emergency health care.  In most studies, public education, at about $5,000 per
child per year, accounts for two-thirds of the costs of these benefits.  Once
aliens achieve a permanent legal status (green card), they are entitled to
AFDC, Food Stamps, and Medicaid. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>For example, a profile of a Mexican illegal alien receiving welfare in
Texas indicated that those interviewed--single mothers--intended to clean
houses, not go on welfare.  But after a baby born in the US gave the family a
US citizen who was eligible for welfare, this poor family began receiving Food
Stamps and WIC food coupons available to mothers with small children.  This
mother asserted that, even if these benefits on which her family depends were
eliminated, she would try to stay in the US, largely because the US offered
more opportunities for poor children like hers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Economist George Borjas believes that immigrants such as this woman are
becoming more dependent on welfare.  Among non-refugees, the more
recently-arrived cohorts are more likely than were earlier immigrants to get
some welfare benefits, and to remain more dependent on at least some
means-tested programs over their lives than were earlier immigrants.  Among
refugees, many of whom get welfare upon their arrival, the rate at which they
reduce their welfare dependence seems to be declining among recent
arrivals.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt><i>Conclusions</i></tt><p>
<tt><i></i>There are two benchmark studies of the public benefits and costs of
immigrants--the Huddle study concluded that the immigrants who arrived in the
US since 1970 impose annual costs of $70 billion, while the Urban Institute
concluded that these immigrants represent a $30 billion net gain (Migration
News, May 1994).  Both look back to see how immigrants who arrived in earlier
years were faring 10 or more years later, and both make assumptions about the
hard-to-measure effects of immigrants on natives.  But neither tackles the
question of how fast immigrant earnings are likely to rise as they integrate
into the US--will they remain poor and go on welfare as they become eligible,
or will they succeed economically, and avoid applying for benefits even if they
are eligible?  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The debate is most heated in California, a high tax and high service state
that is relatively generous with welfare benefits---it was the only major
industrial state to increase benefits with the cost-of living--and it receives
about 40 percent of the nation's immigrants.  In the past, California received
immigrants from abroad and migrants from other states.  Today, California is
losing older and higher income residents to other states--between 1990 and
1993, California lost residents aged 35 and older, as well as those high school
graduates who had not completed college--and gaining young persons without a
high-school diploma.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>While no one can predict the future, the Great Migration from the US South
during the 1950s and 1960s may provide some useful insights.  When over one
million US citizens annually left rural and southern homes for northern cities,
there were predictions that these migrants would not seek welfare because such
assistance was not available in the areas from which they came, and that there
were cultural barriers to dependence on government programs. A combination of
residency restrictions and man-in-the-house rules seemed to prove these
speculations initially correct.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, as the 1960s unfolded, there was a steadily rising participation
of rural-urban immigrants in a welfare system that was offering more benefits
and easier access to them--the rate at which those eligible participated
resembled the letter S--initially few participated, then there was a sharply
rising rate of participation, and then participation leveled off.  No one yet
knows whether eligible immigrants will follow a similar path.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC2">Wilson-Clinton
Spar over Immigration Monies</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>California Governor Pete Wilson filed a second suit on May 31, against the
federal government in an attempt to recoup nearly $370 million in costs for
providing health services to illegal immigrants.  The first lawsuit filed by
Wilson seeks nearly $2 billion from the federal government to reimburse costs
from incarcerating illegal alien felons.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The $370 million suit seeks to collect funds from the federal government to
pay for the costs of providing "emergency" medical services to an estimated
309,000 illegal immigrants.  Wilson said, "The federal government can't keep
sweeping the problem of illegal immigration under the rug while sweeping the
costs onto our already overburdened state taxpayers." </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration responded on June 21 with a proposal to spend
$25 billion on immigrants, including $8.4 billion in California, one-third more
than the Bush Administration spent.  The Wilson Administration countered that
the Clinton spending promise mixed together funds for legal and illegal
immigrant aid.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The governors of California, Arizona, Florida, who have already sued the
federal government, testified on June 21 before the Senate Appropriations
Committee to press their demand for reimbursement of the costs their states
incur to provide services to illegal aliens.  Senators were sympathetic to the
governors descriptions of the influx of illegal aliens as analogous to a
natural disaster or an invasion, but told the governors that it would be hard
to respond to their pleas for money because of the federal budget
deficit.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>It is difficult to get Congress to approve immigrant impact assistance for
a handful of states.  The April proposal by the Clinton Administration to
provide $350 million to help cover the cost of incarcerating illegal aliens in
state prisons was converted in June to an anti-drug program that would provide
benefits to all states.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">First
Haitians Processed at Sea</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Six of the 35 Haitians picked up at sea on June 16 and processed on the
ship Comfort, anchored in Kingston Harbor, Jamaica, were granted refugee
status.  During the first week of the program, 226 Haitians who left Haiti in
small boats were picked up by the US Coast Guard and taken to Jamaica to
determine if they were refugees. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>These are the first Haitian refugees to be processed at sea under the new
Clinton plan.  Previously, the Haitians would have been immediately returned to
Haiti and would have to apply for asylum from their country regardless of the
threat of persecution.  The Haitians will not be allowed to enter Jamaica, and
the operation is scheduled to last for less than six months.  The Clinton
Administration is expecting the number of Haitians to be processed to jump to
about 2,000 per week .  That is a dramatic increase over the 130 Haitians that
the Coast Guard has been picked up each week this year.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A representative from the UN Commission for Refugees will be on board the
ship to explain to the Haitians how the interviews will be conducted and to
answer questions.  The UNHCR has said that those rejected for asylum should be
sent to a safe country until the current Haitian government is removed. The 29
Haitians who were denied asylum on June 16 will be returned to Haiti. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A sympathetic portrait of the 450,000 Haitian-Americans--the 1990 Census Of
Population counted only 306,000 in a severe undercount--emphasizes the
diversity of the immigrants from the nation of seven million (average per
capita GNP in 1991 was $380) that shares an island of Hispanola with seven
million Dominicans (average per capita GNP in 1991 was $940).
Haitian-Americans are mostly middle class--in the 1990 COP, 40 percent had at
least some college education, while only 10 percent had less than an
eighth-grade education.  Haitian-Americans are concentrated around New York
City, where they are 1.5 percent of the population, and Miami (6
percent).</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Haitian immigration to the US peaked in 1980-81, when 45,000 Haitians
arrived.  In 1981, President Reagan ordered that Haitians be stopped at sea
and, through 1991, only 28 of 22,716 Haitians intercepted were admitted to the
US.  Despite generally high levels of education--half of the adult Haitians in
New York City have some college education--seven percent of the Haitian
immigrants there, and 25 percent of second-generation Haitians--are on
welfare.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Florida in June deported the first 113 of the 2,700 illegal aliens who were
jailed in the state for committing non-violent offenses in the US.  All but
three of the first prisoners to be deported were convicted of drug trafficking,
and their release is expected to save Florida up to $15,000 per alien per year.
Some 4,100 of Florida's 54,000 prisoners are foreigners and, according to INS,
1,400 of the foreigners were in the US legally when they committed their
crimes.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Immigrant
Day Laborers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In many California cities, immigrants congregate in lumber and hardware
stores  parking lots and on street corners to wait for employers to hire them
on a daily basis.  These labor shape-ups are considered less-than-satisfactory
by immigrant advocates, who note that unscrupulous employers can go from one to
another cheating the workers they hire; by local residents, who complain of
loitering immigrants; and by employers, who are not sure if qualified workers
will be available. Union employees complain that the illegal immigrants hired
in such day labor markets are willing to work for cut-rate wages--from less
than half of union rates to below minimum wage. The undocumented workers are
competing in construction markets that already offer fewer jobs because of a
stall in home building. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Several cities have tried to organize hiring halls--buildings that offer
sanitary facilities and some services, such as English as a Second Language,
for day laborers.  Some hiring centers cater only to undocumented workers,
others welcome all the unemployed, and some screen workers to determine if they
can work legally in the US.  However, if the centers do screen for legal
status, then they may duplicate state Employment Services, an already existing
network of offices that match workers with jobs for no fee.  If the centers do
not screen workers for legal status, they may be using public funds to help
unauthorized workers find US jobs. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Hiring centers that are "immigration blind" do not usually offer
specialized services because they serve a diverse unemployed clientele.  Hiring
centers that screen for immigration status offer more services, but only to
documented workers.  Some workers avoid the hiring centers for fear employers
will not hire workers who go to them.   </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Hiring centers have been tried numerous times as substitutes for curbside
hiring in southern California, especially after communities ban curbside
hiring.   A University of California, San Diego study of three such centers
concluded that the one which did not screen workers for legal status was more
successful than the two that did. It also concluded that hiring centers can not
work without community support. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles is one of the most recent cities trying to deal with the
problems created by curbside hiring.  After protests by local residents, Los
Angeles County on May 24 enacted an ordinance that bans, effective July 1,
1994, laborers from curbside solicitation of jobs--curbside job-seeking  will
be a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.  The
three county supervisors who supported the measure to restrict day laborers
said that they were trying to reduce traffic and sanitation problems, not send
an anti-immigrant message.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles' district attorney threatened not to enforce the ordinance,
saying that, "it would be difficult for me to prosecute someone for simply
trying to get a job."  The ban on curbside hiring affects only unincorporated
areas of the county, where about 10 percent of Los Angeles 9.2 million people
live.  The city of Los Angeles has opened hiring halls for immigrants, while
nearby Agoura Hills banned curbside hiring in July 1991 after a worker was
killed in the rush to trucks to find day jobs; its ban was upheld by California
courts in May 1994.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The wealthy Malibu Colony outside of Los Angeles has had a mixed experience
with hiring centers.  A hiring center opened in 1990, but closed four months
later.  In December 1991, a task force recommended opening an official hiring
center and passing an ordinance to prohibit employers from hiring at
unauthorized sites.  In 1993, the Malibu Labor Exchange Center opened with
support from city and county officials, and it is credited with reducing the
number of places day laborers congregate.  Over 30 workers report to the center
each day, and 20 requests for workers are made by employers. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In the Northern California county of Marin, the INS reports that legal
immigrants are turning in illegal immigrants at day labor sites because too
many workers are competing for too few jobs.  The Canal Area of Marin has an
estimated 10,000 residents; since January 1993, the INS has arrested between
1,000 and 1,500 illegal</tt><p>
<tt>immigrants in the area.  However, many are set free with temporary work
permits so that they can support themselves until their deportation
hearing--one to 12 months later.  Temporary work permits entitle illegal
immigrants to apply for temporary Social Security cards and work anywhere in
the United States--2,000 are issued each month in the Bay Area.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Immigration
and the California Election '94</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Between 1980 and 1990, California added six million to its population,
bringing it to 30 million, and three million jobs.  The population growth was
fueled by natural increase  (births exceeding deaths) and by immigration as
well as more Americans from other states moving to California than left the
state.  The job boom was the result of economic growth nationwide, and
especially rising defense expenditures.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Since 1990, population growth has slowed, and California has lost jobs.
Natural increase is about 400,000 annually, and legal and illegal immigration
adds about 300,000.  However, about 250,000 more Americans leave than enter
California, meaning that the state adds only about 450,000 new residents
annually, two-thirds of 1980s levels.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>California lost 600,000 jobs since mid-1990, or 200,000 per year.  Many of
the lost jobs paid relatively high wages, since they were associated with
defense manufacturing.  Many of the new jobs created, on the other hand, have
been lower wage service jobs.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration was not the cause of the demographic or economic shifts in
California in the 1990s, but the fact that legal and illegal immigrants
continue to arrive in large numbers at a time when the state budget is strained
made immigration one of the top four issues in the race for Governor --in a Los
Angeles Times exit poll on June 7, the day the political parties picked their
candidates for the November 8 election, immigration and education joined the
economy and crime as the issues most important to voters.  California Governor
Pete Wilson highlighted immigration as a problem for California and advocated
reducing services especially to illegal immigrants, as well as developing more
reliable identification documents.  His Republican challenger did not make
controlling illegal immigration the basis of his campaign--but he did propose
reduced services and preferences such as bilingual education and affirmative
action to turn off the "social welfare magnet" that allegedly encourages
illegal immigrants to come to California.  </tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>The two major Democratic candidates also argued that something must
be done to reduce illegal immigration, but they favored border and interior
enforcement to keep illegal immigrants out and prevent those who slip in from
getting jobs. Kathleen Brown argued for more federal Border Patrol agents and a
reliable identification system, while John Garamendi argued for a reliable
identification system and endorsed PRIDE principles--Proponents for Responsible
Immigration Debate and Education--which include continuation of jus solis,
continued immigrant access to health and education services, and economic
assistance for Mexico and other sending nations.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>US Senator Diane Feinstein (D-CA) reintroduced legislation to require
counterfeit-proof worker ID cards for all workers and to cut some welfare
benefits now available to immigrants.  Feinstein's bill also proposes stiffer
penalties for alien smuggling, streamlines mechanisms for deporting criminal
illegal aliens, and establishes a $1.00 border-crossing fee to help pay for
beefed-up enforcement. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Public
Opinion on Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A public opinion poll released by the Field Institute on June 9 found that
most Californians support measures to slow down illegal immigration, including
a $1 dollar fee for crossing the border to provide more funds for border
enforcement and deporting illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Proposals to deny services to illegal immigrants vary by the ethnicity of
the respondent.  Three-fourths of the Californians polled believe illegal
immigrants should not receive welfare payments.  Among white voters, 85 percent
oppose welfare for  illegal immigrants; among Latinos, 50 percent are in favor.
Illegal immigrants are not eligible for US welfare, but their US citizen
children are entitled to benefits.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>About 55 percent of whites favor amending the US Constitution to deny
automatic citizenship to children born in the US of undocumented immigrants,
and 59 percent of the whites believe that the children of illegal aliens should
not be allowed to attend public schools--77 percent of the Latinos, by
contrast, approve illegal alien children in public schools.  Non-voters tend to
support public education for illegal alien children, while voters do not.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Most Californians do not support the creation of special identification
cards to control illegal immigration--49 percent said agreed such a was not a
good idea.  However, 55 percent of the whites oppose an ID card, while 56
percent of the Latinos thought it would be a good idea. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A national CBS poll conducted in May found that 29 percent of those
surveyed think immigrants contribute to the US, while 53 percent said they
cause problems. Only 16 percent agreed that immigrants would make American
society better, 41 percent said they would make it worse, and 32 percent said
they wouldn't affect American society.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The share of Americans who agree that economic hard times in the United
States make it difficult to continue welcoming immigrants who arrive with few
assets rose to 65 percent, up from 60 percent in January, and 45 percent in a
1986  poll, CBS reported that despite these opinions, only 34 percent said
immigration should be stopped, while 19 percent said the US should always
welcome immigrants.  Thirty-two percent said immigrants take jobs from
Americans, but 52 percent said they were jobs Americans didn't want anyway.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US Conference of Mayors reported the results of a survey of the leaders
of 78 cities at their annual meeting in Portland on June 13.  It found that the
benefits produced by immigrants in these cities are believed to outweigh the
problems associated with the delivery of services to them. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The report found that foreign-born persons represent an average 11 percent
of the population in the 78 cities, and more than one-fourth of the cities
believe that their foreign-born population was undercounted in the 1990 census.
Just over two out of three of the cities reported that they have benefited from
the presence of immigrants, principally through economic development, increased
availability of both skilled and unskilled labor, and social and cultural
contributions to the community.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The major problems were in the delivery and financing of health, social,
language and other services.  Fifty-seven percent of the cities said these
problems relate to the presence of legal immigrants; 56 percent said they
relate to the</tt><p>
<tt>presence of undocumented persons.  City governments in nearly one-third of
the cities help new immigrants to resettle.  Officials surveyed called for
increased resources for the Border Patrol to reduce illegal immigration.</tt><p>

Self-Employment--A Two-Edged Sword</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A higher percentage of immigrants (7.6 percent) than natives (7 percent)
were self employed in the 1990 Census Of Population, and the proportion of
immigrants who are self employed tends to rise with time in the US.
Self-employed immigrants have the highest average incomes of all types of
immigrants--$30,000 in 1989--and they are credited with revitalizing inner city
neighborhoods from Watts to Brooklyn.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, immigrant revitalization can be a two-edged sword.  Chinese
immigrants who created New York's third largest Chinatown in Brooklyn drove out
drug dealers and pushed up real estate values, but they also brought sweatshops
and Asian gangs into the area.  An estimated 10,000 Chinese immigrants--perhaps
one-third illegal aliens--work up to 70 hours weekly for as little as $500
monthly, an hourly wage that is less than half of the federal $4.25 minimum.
It has proven to be very difficult to enforce labor and other laws that set
minimum standards in neighborhoods with large numbers of recent
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Many of the 65,000 Chinese in Brooklyn were legalized under a provision of
IMMACT (1990) that opened slots for those in the US after the 1989 Tiananmen
Square killings.   </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC8">English-Only
Rules in the Workplace</a>
</a><br>
</h2>
<tt>The US Supreme Court refused to decide on the validity of a 24-year old
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission policy that employer rules which
required only English in the workplace were presumed to be discriminatory.
According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 120 US employers have
been accused of unfairly imposing English-only rules.  In 1993, the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the EEOC had no authority to issue such a
rule prohibiting English-only in the workplace and, when this ruling was
appealed to the US Supreme Court, the Clinton Administration urged that the
federal appeals court ruling be overturned.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This means that a California company can continue to require that its
employees speak only English on the job.  The Clinton Administration had argued
that the appeals court ruling--which made it more difficult for employees to
challenge English-only workplace rules--makes it too hard for employees who
wish to speak a language other than English at work to challenge the "business
necessity" of such rules.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In one such case in San Francisco, five Filipino-American security guards
were reassigned after a false alarm got officials out of bed because the guard
on duty allegedly had such a strong accent that his explanation could not be
understood.  They were awarded $87,500 from the US government, and additional
funds from their employer, a private security firm, for discrimination.

<tt>Operation Hold the Line has reduced the number of illegal aliens entering
the US near El Paso, Texas from 10,000 to 100 per day, according to the INS.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, there may be some diversion of aliens attempting entry to Arizona.
The Tucson INS sector, for example, apprehended an average 6,000 aliens monthly
in FY 1992, and 7,700 monthly in FY93.  However, in April 1994, apprehensions
rose to almost 15,000, leading some to speculate that aliens are simply being
diverted along the 2000 mile US-Mexican border.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In a visit to the border region in San Diego, INS Commissioner Doris
Meissner said that over the next six months, 400 border agents will be added to
the San Diego border area and they will get 222 new patrol cars with encrypted
radios so that alien smugglers can't hear their conversations.  A new computer
system called ENFORCE puts 51 INS forms into an integrated computer database
and reduces processing time from 20 minutes to three or four minutes for each
alien apprehended will be tested in San Diego in July.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Reacting to the success of Operation Hold the Line, the House
Appropriations Committee on June 15 approved the addition of 700 Border Patrol
agents. <b> </b>The $4.5 million measure must now be approved by the full House
of Representatives and the Senate before these additional agents can be hired.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The US House of Representatives also authorized the use of active-duty
military personnel to police the Mexican border.  This amendment to the defense

Controls and Foreign Workers in the EU</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The 12-nation European Union promised four freedoms when it was founded in
1957--the freedom to move goods, services, capital, and labor across the
borders of member nations.  The Single European Act (EC-92) and the Maastricht
Treaty restated the EU's commitment to a border-free Europe, and nine EU
members signed the Schengen agreement (all but Denmark, Ireland, and the UK),
which established the goal of removing border checks on their common borders by
January 1, 1993, meaning that EU nationals, such as Germans and Frenchmen, as
well as third-country nationals such as Americans<b> </b>and Turks, could move
freely from Germany to France or between Belgium and the Netherlands.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Four deadlines for a border-free Europe have come and gone.  The current
target date for a border-free Europe is October 1994.  There are today more
stories of restoring border checks and controls than progress toward their
elimination.  As one perhaps unanticipated consequence of another EU
agreement--the Dublin agreements that require asylum applicants to have their
cases heard in the first EU country they reach-- countries such as the
Netherlands have stepped up their use of border checks--including using video
cameras to prove that asylum applicants entered from Germany for asylum, and
thus must be returned to Germany to apply. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In May 1994, Denmark applied to become an observer under the Schengen
convention, a move expected to put pressure on Britain and Ireland, as well as
the other Nordic countries expected to join the EU in 1995, to take steps
toward a border-free Europe.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The European Parliament will create a European Ombudsman after June 1994
elections and, according to some observers, complaints about border controls
should keep the ombudsman busy.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On June 20, 1994 EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers approved a
resolution that would confirm at the EU level national restrictions on
immigration.  Over the protest of the Belgium minister, a Resolution that
national polices restricting</tt><p>
<tt>immigrant workers from entering countries "should be maintained and
where</tt><p>
<tt>necessary reinforced" was approved.  According to the resolution, EU member
nations should "refuse entry to their territories of third-country
nationals</tt><p>
<tt>for the purpose of employment," with "admission for temporary employment"
permitted only as " a very narrow exception" in cases where there is a vacant
job that requires specialized skills and, if unfilled, the viability of the
business is threatened.  There are exceptions for seasonal foreign workers
employed for less than six months, and for trainees in the host EU country for
up to 12 months.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>This resolution contradicts the February proposal (COMMA (94) 23) of
Padraig Flynn, the European Commissioner with responsibility for immigration
issues, to permit the nine million legal immigrants living in the EU to move
and work in another Member State.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The ministers also approved a feasibility study of the EURODAC network.  If
implemented, the system would fingerprint asylum-seekers and suspected illegal
immigrants at their first point of entry, and then circulate the information
among member nations.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">Immigration
in Germany</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germany is the major country of immigration in Europe.  Over the past five
years, an average 830,000 foreigners annually arrived in the former West
Germany, producing one of the world's highest rates of immigration.  In the
former West Germany, deaths exceed births, so that immigrants who add about 1.5
percent annually to the 60 million population there are far more visible than
the comparable rate of immigration to turn-of-the-century US.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germany's "melting pot" has been marked by violence against and marches in
support of foreigners;  Ueberfremdung(overforeignization) was deemed the
"worst" new word to enter the German vocabulary in 1993.  However, there is
still no German immigration or immigrant (integration) policy.  Chancellor Kohl
has appealed to his EU partners to develop an EU-wide immigration policy to
deal with immigration, what he called the central challenge "facing Europe in
the 1990s."  However, after 12 years in office, his coalition government has
dealt only with asylum--it has not so far tackled naturalization or rules for
admitting immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Naturalization</tt><p>
<tt>Germany has a rather difficult naturalization procedure that includes the
requirement that persons wishing to become German citizens give up their
original citizenship.  One proposal to deal with naturalization is to allow
dual citizenship and to allow non-citizen residents to vote in local elections.
At its three-day congress in early June, 1994, the FDP (Free Democratic Party)
pledged to introduce legislation that would reform Germany's 1913 citizenship
laws and permit foreigners to vote in local elections if Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's governing coalition is returned to power in the October 1994 election.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, Commissioner for Aliens Affairs, was elected to
the FDP presidium at the Congress.  She has been championing dual citizenship
and similar reforms to promote the integration of foreigners in Germany.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>President Demirel of Turkey in April 1994 appealed for Turks living in
Germany to give up their Turkish citizenship and become naturalized Germans so
that they could become a more effective "lobby for Turkey" in Europe.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Asylum</tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers in Germany continued to fall in 1994.  After
averaging 12,000 monthly between January and April, the number of asylum
seekers fell to 9,300 in May.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There has been a great deal of speculation about how illegal attempts to
enter Germany would respond to the July 1, 1993 changes in German asylum laws
and procedures.  On the German-Polish border, apprehensions have decreased,
from an average 1,500 monthly--two-thirds Romanians-- in 1993 to 1,200 monthly
in April and May 1994.  In 1992, there were 46,200 foreigners apprehended on
the job in Germany, and there were 5,200 preliminary proceedings initiated
against contract workers suspected of working illegally.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>About 86,000 Germans emigrated in 1992; two-thirds of them remained in
Europe.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Almost 50,000 Aussiedler (ethnic Germans), most from the Asian republics of
the former USSR,  arrived in Germany during the first three months of 1994.
Under a 1993 revision of the German law, a maximum 225,000 Aussiedler are
permitted to enter Germany each year from the former USSR. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In April 1994, the German Parliament amended its Employment Promotion Law
(Beschaeftigugngsforderungsgesetz) to permit private employment agencies to
match even unskilled workers and jobs.  This reform also permits unemployed
workers drawing UI benefits to be placed for up to three months in seasonal
agricultural jobs for which they will receive 25DM ($15) daily.  In 1993, most
of the 200,000 seasonal foreign workers employed in Germany worked in
agriculture.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">Immigration
in European Elections</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration was an issue in recent elections across Europe.  Voters in
European Union nations went to the polls on June 9 and 12 to choose members for
five-year terms in the European Parliament.  The Greek chair of the EU's
Council for Foreign Ministers says that employment and migration flows will be
the "main economic and social problems for the next decade." </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>However, local issues rather than overarching issues such as immigration
seemed to influence voting in many countries.  Voter turnout was low--about 50
percent.  The Socialists were rejected by voters in France; Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democrats staged a major comeback after a shaky start; John
Major's Conservative Party lost half of its 32 seats in the European Parliament
to  the Labor Party; and the governing Spanish Socialists led by Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez paid for Spain's 22 percent unemployment rate losing to the
conservative Popular Party. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Hard campaigning by Chancellor Kohl in Germany, as well as a recovering
economy and a strong stand against continued immigration, helped the CDU widen
its lead over the Social Democrats. A compromise between Kohl's CDU and the
Social Democrats in 1993 sharply decreased the number of asylum seekers into
Germany, and helped to explain why the rightist Republicans are likely to fall
short of the five percent threshold needed to win seats in the Bundestag in the
October federal elections--they won only 3.9 percent of the vote.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The far-right Nationalist Front in France experienced similar problems.
Instead of an expected 15 percent of the vote, the Nationalist Front received
only 10.5 percent.  Analysts say the conservative government's success in
imposing stricter immigration controls negated the Nationalist Front's hottest
issue--immigration. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On June 12, 1994, Austria said yes to Europe--66 percent of Austrian voters
approved the country becoming the thirteenth member nation of the EU.  A yes
vote, which seemed assured earlier in 1994 when Austria, Norway, Sweden and
Finland scheduled referendums on EU membership, was made uncertain by fears
that Austria would lose its identity and be overrun by foreigners.  The
questions directed to the government's "Say yes to Europe" campaign offices
included "Could all foreigners, including Turks, settle in Austria?" reflecting
fears that foreigners would flood the country due to the EU's allegedly looser
border controls.</tt><p>

<tt>Over the past two years, about 870 refugees--many without passports or
documents-- have arrived in Sweden by boat from Latvia, which is only 90 miles
across the Baltic Sea.  In early 1994, the Swedish government attempted to slow
the flow of asylum-seekers by raising the penalty for smuggling aliens from six
months to two years in prison.  Sweden also donated nine retrofitted former
coast guard patrol boats to the three Baltic countries, and helped train
customs officers in Estonia. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Almost all of the boat refugees en route to Sweden come via Russia.
Official Russian estimates are that more than 500,000 foreigners are awaiting
onward passage.  A Swedish immigration ministry spokesperson said that Sweden's
liberal asylum laws and generous welfare system attract asylum-seekers.  The
Swedish government does not return asylum seekers to Afghanistan or Iraq, but
does return those from Bangladesh.  Sweden would like the Baltic states to
improve border controls and sign the Geneva Convention on Refugees so that the
Swedish government could return asylum-seekers. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Nordic countries, the United States and Canada will give the Baltics
and Belarus $1.5 million to support their efforts to prevent illegal
immigration and assist refugees.  The program includes assistance to Russian

want to move to Latin America or other regions. </tt><p>

<tt>Portugal is the poorest EC member-nation, with a per capita income of

speculation that large numbers of Portuguese would emigrate after they got full
freedom of movement rights on January 1, 1992.  The Portuguese National
Institute of Statistics reported that in 1992, 39,000 workers left the country,
57 percent permanently (with the intention of being gone one year or more), and
43 percent temporarily.  Half of both types of migrants went to France and
Switzerland.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Portugal has a workforce of about 4.9 million, so the emigrants represented
almost one percent of the Portuguese labor force and about two-thirds of the

<a name="RTFToC21">Taiwan
Threatens to Halt Importation of Filipino Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan is threatening to halt the importation of Filipino workers because
of new employment requirements placed on the workers and their Taiwanese
employers by the Filipino government.  Taiwan has about 183,000 foreign workers
in the country, including at least 50,000 Filipinos, who work primarily as
domestics and nurses. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The employment requirements are meant to protect Filipinos working in
Taiwan.  They require Taiwanese employers of Filipino domestic helpers and
private nurses to provide workers compensation insurance in the event of
on-the-job injury and advise the worker of their financial status.  The Taiwan
government objects to these rules because they infringe upon its sovereignty.
The issues are expected to be discussed at the annual labor talks later this
month. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Taiwan Association of Employment Agencies supports a ban on new
Filipino workers--it is not submitting requests for any new workers to Manila.
Taiwan labor officials say that if the additional Filipino workers are banned,
they will allow employers to bring in workers from other countries. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Taiwan Council of Labor Affairs  has considered freezing the
importation of  foreign workers because the labor shortage is "over."  The
council would make exceptions for companies investing over NT$100 million, but
these companies would not be allowed to have foreigner workers exceed 30
percent of the company's work force. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some Taiwanese employers apparently do not treat foreign workers well--they
have been ordered to improve the safety, health and welfare conditions for
their foreign workers or face penalties.  Typical violations include too many
overtime hours, no days off, and failure to provide proper welfare benefits.

<a name="RTFToC22">Japan:
Chinese Illegal Immigrants and Guestworkers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Over 4,000 Chinese entered Japan illegally, primarily to work, in the past
five and one-half years, according the Justice Ministry's Immigration Bureau.
Many of the illegal immigrants are believed to have been smuggled aboard
freighters and other vessels by the Chinese mafia, called Snake Head.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of migrants being smuggled into Japan in groups is rising.  In
1990, 18 Chinese arrived in two groups; in 1992, 396 arrived in 14 groups; and,
in 1993, 335 arrived in seven groups.  Between January and May, 1994, 250
Chinese in eight groups were smuggled into Japan. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some Vietnamese set out in boats for Japan, transiting through Hong Kong,
because of a rumor that Japan is welcoming foreign workers with financial
assistance and extended visa stays.  The UNHCR is working in Hue, Vietnam to
halt the spread of the rumor.  Last month Japan announced that it would return
any boat people who arrived in the country after March 5, without screening
them for refugee status. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Thirty-one nations agreed at a meeting in Geneva in February that
Vietnamese would no longer be given preferential treatment over asylum seekers
form other countries. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Japanese Guestworkers</tt><p>
<tt>Haruo Shimada, Japan's best-known labor economist, recently released a
220-page book that showcases his proposal to develop a work-and-learn program
through which unskilled workers could fill vacant jobs, learn skills and, if
they settled, be accepted and integrated into Japanese society.  The book has
eight chapters grouped into three parts--overview, a work-and-learn temporary
worker proposal, and long-term solutions to the problem of illegal immigration
and labor shortages in Japan.  Getting the Japanese to accept foreigners may
not be easy--a Tokyo poll reported that 64 percent of residents dislike having
foreigners in their neighborhoods, and 57 percent agreed that the Japanese
discriminate against foreigners. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Most of the book is devoted to explaining why guestworkers are inevitable,
and why the foreigners admitted must have legal status, be paid appropriate
wages and housed and trained by their Japanese employers, and why Japan must be
prepared to integrate those who will settle after their three- to five-year
work-and-learn programs.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The book provides a valuable summary of recent Japanese immigration policy
and data, and carefully explains a leading proposal to deal with illegal
immigration.  It is hortatory, however, and may not do full justice to those
who oppose foreign workers in Japan.  The need or demand for (foreign) workers
depends on their cost, and if EMPLOYERS had to bear all of the costs that would
be implicit in the work-and-learn proposal--everything from preparatory
Japanese language training to on-the-job training in Japan--they may decide
they do not need many foreign workers--automating, adjusting workplaces and
wages to attract local workers, or investing abroad might seem more attractive.
If society as a whole bears these costs, then employers who offer 3D
jobs--dirty, dangerous, and difficult--are being subsidized to maintain such
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The central issue facing countries such as Japan is simple.  Demographics
make it clear that the supply of workers in the future will be limited--even if
wages and workplaces were radically altered, low-fertility Japan would soon run
out of the workers needed for a growing labor force.  What is not clear is how
sensitive the demand for additional workers is to rising wages, i.e., how
needed are unskilled foreign workers?  Industrial nations are not testing the
sensitivity of the demand for unskilled foreign workers to labor shortages
because illegal workers are showing up everywhere, making such tests
unnecessary.  If their presence is inevitable, as Shimada asserts, then it is
better for legal and humanitarian reasons that they be legal rather than
illegal, which is what gives rise to proposals for managing foreign
workers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Neither the traditional immigration countries of North America nor the
guestworker countries of Western Europe have managed to find a happy compromise
between wanting foreign workers but not foreign residents.  This book in
several places says that "just a little more effort" to open the work-and-learn
program to "hundreds of thousands" of unskilled foreign workers will enable
Japan to succeed in managing migration.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are over 200,000 Bangladeshi migrant workers in Malaysia, half of
whom are there illegally.  Most of the Bangladeshis work in plantations and
construction. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysia-Bangladesh Friendship Clinic was set up in Bangladesh to
provide  lab tests for  communicable diseases such as hepatitis B,
tuberculosis, syphilis and cholera and to register Bangladeshi workers headed
for Malaysia. </tt><p>
<tt>There was a 30 percent increase in tuberculosis patients in Malaysia in
1993, although the disease was thought to be eliminated in the country. Some
blame the increase in foreign workers on the increasing number of persons with
communicable diseases. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A team of Malaysian doctors inspected 70 clinics in Bangladesh and found
that none were conducting medical tests that meet Malaysian requirements, and
some clinics were selling medical certificates to prospective job seekers.  The
Friendship Clinic is staffed by Malaysians.  Since April 1994, the clinic has
screened 50,00 workers bound for Malaysia and found 2,273 to be medically
unfit.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to press accounts "thousands" of illegal Indonesian workers have
set</tt><p>
<tt>up squatter colonies deep inside estate plantations in Malaysia, living in
tents and moving to where jobs are available.  The National Union of</tt><p>
<tt>Plantation Workers, the largest union in Malaysia with 60,000 members,
reports that such migrancy from plantation to plantation is a new
phenomonon.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Squatting is a major issue in booming Malaysia--in booming areas such as
Kuala Lumpur and Johore Bahru, as many as one-eighth of the population are
squatters.  According to some reports, Malaysians who move into low-cost
government housing rent out their own squatter housing to Indonesian
immigrants.  Some Malaysians argue that the Indonesians do not want to spend
money on housing, since they aim to remit 50 percent of their earnings to
Indonesia.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC27">Australia:
Immigration and Housing</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Australia has announced an immigration quota for 1994 of 86,000, which
includes the conversion of 8,300 Chinese students into immigrants.  Immigration
to Australia is down sharply despite the fact that the economy is booming--the
1994 quota is less than half the 1988 peak of 173,000.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are several reasons why Australia is reducing immigration (MN, June
1994).  Unemployment remains at 10 percent.  Asians rather than Europeans are
arriving--43 percent of 1992-93 immigrants were from Vietnam, the Philippines,
and Hong Kong, and other Asian nations.  Australia abandoned its "white
Australia" immigration policy in 1972, but there seems to be some backlash
against the rising proportion of Asian immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry, the Australian
government's adviser on housing, has said that the long-term demand for housing
is affected by demographic factors, including immigration.  The IPC's most
recent report states: "The level of immigration, which at present is
contributing less than half of total population growth, is a particularly
important determinant of the long-run trend in the demand for housing."  A
higher level of  immigration will lead to a substantial increase in demand for
housing and household formation. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Housing Industry Association uses a rough "rule of thumb" that 3,000 to
3,500 houses must be built for every 10,000 immigrants who arrive in Australia.
There are variations by type of immigrant-- family unification immigrants are
more likely to live with a family rather than buy their own house immediately.
Business migrants, on the other hand, will likely have more resources at their
disposal and obtain housing immediately upon their arrival. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Bureau of  Immigration  and Population Research reported this year that
"by adding to excess demand for low-priced homes and cheap rental accommodation
on inner and middle suburbs, it may be argued that immigrants have inflated
rental and property values."  However, "if  immigration  stimulates economic
development, proportionally fewer people will be poor and redevelopment becomes
economically more feasible...."</tt><p>

<tt>The Zentrum f&uuml;r Sozialpolitik, Uni Bremen, Parkallee 39, D-28209
Bremen has several working papers on immigration and integration issues in
Germany.  Thomas Faist, in <u>How to Define a Foreigner?  The Symbolic Politics
of Immigration in German Partisan Discourse, 1978-1992</u> (12/93) explains how
German politicians have been able to maintain that the country was not an
immigration country even as immigrants poured in.  If Germans who were expelled
from the east are included, then 18 million "immigrants" arrived in the former
West Germany between 1945 and 1989, versus 16 million immigrants to the US
during this period.  Political parties knew that voters thought too many
immigrants were in Germany, and they advocated hard to enforce symbolic
policies to stop migration and promote returns and at the same time encourage
integration.  This turned immigration into a meta issue, in which immigrants
became the symbols of an overstretched welfare state and high
unemployment.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to Faist, the CDU-CSU began to use anti-immigrant sentiments to
gain votes in the early 1980s.  Party differences were sharpened in 1992, when
the SPD agreed with the  CDU-CSU-FDP coalition government that the Constitution
had to be amended in order to reduce the influx of asylees.  The SPD is now
pushing for dual citizenship, which the CDU-CSU-FDP government opposes.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Working paper 13/93, <u>Boundaries of National Welfare States:  Immigrants
and Social Rights</u>, includes a useful table comparing the access of various
categories of immigrants to pensions, welfare, and work-related benefits.
Germany generally provides more access to legal immigrants and refugees, but
fewer benefits to illegal aliens--in Germany, for example, illegal alien
children are not entitled to free public education as in the US and, since
children born in Germany are not automatically German citizens, they can not
lead to welfare benefits for the family, as in the US.</tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Gruter Institute for Law and Behavioral Research has announced it will
focus on three issues: human migration, security and risk, and sex and gender.
The Gruter Institute is a small California foundation whose work is motivated
by the belief that rapid advances in the biology of human behavior have
important implications for the law and the social sciences.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Evolutionary biology is the basis for the Institute's work.  Biology
distinguishes between proximate cause--such as how birds stake out territory
for mating--from ultimate cause--why they stake out territory.  The unifying
principle is natural selection--the notion that the goal of all living
organisms is to maximize their Reproductive Success (RS), and that the species
around us reflect the differential success of individuals in Reproductive
Success.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Evolutionary biologists observe the behavior of animals, insects, and
humans, and interpret what they observe under the assumption that each organism
is trying to maximize its RS.  There is thus a deal of interest in territory
and hierarchy--how each individual and group defines its home space and
maintains order.  Cooperation and competition can be observed in the individual
and group interactions observed.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some economists believe that evolutionary biology may fill an important
lacuna in economic theory--why do individuals have the tastes that they do?
Assuming that social individuals are in competition to achieve RS, but require
cooperation to survive and prosper, they note that society must develop rules
to identify and remove cheaters, especially in heterogeneous societies in which
there are continuing interactions.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Evolutionary biologists believe that their theories can explain complex
human behavior, but many of their insights about human behavior arise from
animal observation.  RS strategies can be observed in individual and group
interactions.  </tt><p>
<tt>There is always uncertainty about how another individual will react to
altruism and stinginess, and most species have evolved strategies that avoid
mutually disadvantageous behavior.  The most common interactive strategy is
tit-for-tat--favors and cooperation are rewarded by more of the same, and
deception or rejection is followed by the same response.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>An evolutionary biology approach may help to illuminate why immigration is
controversial in industrial countries.  Some evolutionary biologists consider
RS a more fundamental explanation for migration than the familiar trio of
family, safe haven, and economic opportunity.  Evolutionary biology would add
RS--some consider even more fundamental--to this trio of reasons for migration.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Evolutionary biologists note that uncertainty and insecurity among natives
can lead to anti-immigrant behavior.  This would imply that those who are
unemployed and poor would tend to oppose immigrants more than those who are
secure and affluent, and that anti-immigrant attitudes would be strongest if
the immigrants are different in appearance or behavior.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Perhaps the best summary statement of the RS approach to human behavior is
that "biology matters."  However, just as in the long-running debate over
whether fiscal or monetary policy is most effective in spurring economic
growth, so the effects of nature and nurture interact in human and social and
political life.  An understanding of the biological imperatives that undergird
human behavior should enrich our understanding of complex human behavior,
including migration. </tt><p>
