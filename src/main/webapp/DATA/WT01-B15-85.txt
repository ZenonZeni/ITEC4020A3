Looking at the chart of the TSE 100 Resources chart, the index has stayed in its trading channel, bounced off the bottom of the channel and is rapidly moving higher. The one natural resource sector that didn't show up on the relative strength rankings was the TSE Oil and Gas index. While apparently under performing for the last few weeks, the TSE Oil index has actually broken above the price ceiling at about 5300 points. This is an important move for professional investors and traders. They see such a move as an important signal that "supply" has been overcome by "demand" and indicates good odds that oil share prices are going higher. I have remained positive on natural resources for quite a while. This is a clear opportunity to add natural resource funds to your portfolio if you have not bought into this sector. 10% of portfolio is my maximum exposure for this one. Please remember, if you already own a Canadian equity fund you will already have about a 40% exposure to natural resource plays. The natural resources fund purchase augments (or overweights) you in this area.<p>Finally, recent news items report that stock promoter Robert Friedland, the star of the megabuck's sale of his Voisey's Bay nickel property to Inco, has had his US$153 million profits temporarily frozen by the US government. They claim that Friedland failed to clean up massive environmental damage in Colorado. Some observers say that a small <i>lake</i> of cyanide and other lethal chemicals exist. The mess was left by Friedland's Galactic Resources Heap Leaching operation a few years ago. Friedland is crying foul, saying that he was not properly advised of the injunction so his lawyers could defend him and that the US government had never legally proven his involvement with the damage. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse100re.gif">TSE Resource<p></a><a href="charts/goldspre.gif">Gold Spread<p></a><a href="charts/tsegoldi.gif">TSE Gold Index<p></a><a href="charts/tsemetal.gif">TSE Metals<p></a><a href="charts/tsepaper.gif">TSE Paper<p></a><a href="charts/tseoilan.gif">TSE Oil/Gas<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="canada.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="mutual.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>85</center></body></html>
