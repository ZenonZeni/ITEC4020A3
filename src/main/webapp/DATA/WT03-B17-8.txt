<font size=+3><b>Controlling Imports is Difficult</font></b>
</center>

<hr>
<i>by Joshua Levine</i><p>

<img src="../caps/icap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="I">n mid-December the Communist Party Politburo sent an urgent directive to local Communist Party units and governments which control imports and exports by issuing quotas, telling them to get serious about reforming trade, and reminding them of their gatekeeper status. The directive, issued by Vietnam's highest authority, demands that two resolutions issued earlier this year, geared to combating smuggling, tax evasion, and other offenses associated with trade, be enforced. State-owned trading companies in Vietnam were established to control the flow of goods in and out of the country. For example, luxury consumer goods are meant to represent a maximum of 20% of all imports, theoretically possible by orchestrating the import quotas held by importers. A main purpose is to control the export of foreign currency.<p>

However, the government has recognized that some unscrupulous traders, foreign as well as local, use schemes to circumvent import quotas and corresponding duties‹otherwise known as smuggling and tax evasion.<p>

One industry member, a Southeast Asian trader, points out a damaging scam that is especially popular, called under-invoicing.<p>

This enables the buyer to duck tariffs by undervaluing the cargo to the customs officer at the port, who must inspect invoices for every piece of cargo to insure duty payment. The example is shampoo imported from Thailand, a luxury consumer good subject to a 40% duty.<p>

"The invoice states a $50 value. Then the buyer pays the import company, which technically owns the merchandise at that point, the $50 as listed on the invoice. In reality, the buyer purchased the goods from the Thai manufacturer for $100, not $50, and the other $50 is on credit.

But remittance can only go out for the invoice value. So two or three times a week he can get on an airplane and legally transport up to $10,000 in cash to Thailand. Having avoided half the duties and tariffs, he can sell undersell his competitors, who then are motivated to engage in the same practice." Officials have cracked down on this sort of tax evasion in more than one high-profile instances in HCMC this year.<p>

A related phenomenon reflects the reality of trying to control the remittance of foreign exchange through the quota system.<p>

"ABC foreign trader signs a contract with the import company, which is responsible for remitting payment for the invoice amount of the shipment. Let's say ABC foreign trading company was extended credit by the overseas seller and repays in installments. The import company makes remittances by presenting the invoices to any bank along with the amount they need to transfer. Since it is based on the invoice value in most cases, this is a way that the amount of foreign exchange going out is regulated, but isn't fail-safe.<p>

If a trading company has 200 transactions per month, and needs to remit 10 payments on each per month, that's 2,000 payments the trader is doing through the bank. What happens is the trader or import company loses track of which invoices were paid, and how much, and at a busy bank this information is difficult to administer. The end result is another instance in which regulating outflow becomes a challenge."<p>

The trader says, as does the Government, that the worst corruption is pure smuggling, as legitimate traders can't compete with their duty-free prices. "Smuggling is always greatest where per capita income is lowest and duties on luxury items are the highest. They have little to lose by getting caught, and high duties cause great demand for cheaper luxury items."
In his opinion, based on trading throughout the region, only lower duties will decrease smuggling. <p>
