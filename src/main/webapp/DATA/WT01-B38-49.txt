<h2> <b>The Ohio Dry Campaign of 1918</b> </h2>

<p>The successor organization to the Ohio Anti-Saloon League, the
Ohio Council on Alcohol Problems, lent Professor John C. Burnham
a set of campaign broadsides from the Ohio prohibition referendum
campaign of 1918. Austin Kerr made Xerox copies of these
materials, and, with the help of Liyan Liu, they are now scanned
and ready for use in teaching and other multi-media applications.
So far as we know, these items were never copyrighted; in any
case, their age indicates that they are in the public domain. We
will appreciate persons using these materials to note that they
are &quot;Courtesy of The Ohio State University Department of
History.&quot; </p>

<p>Ohio was a very closely contested state in the national
campaign to eradicate the liquor traffic by declaring illegal the
businesses of manufacturing, distributing, and selling alcoholic
beverages. Ohio was the birthplace of both the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union (1874) and the Anti-Saloon League (1893). The
WCTU brought a special zeal to the prohibition effort in the
1880s, failing to achieve state-wide dry legislation but
disturbing Ohio political life nevertheless. The Anti-Saloon
League later (and with the help of the WCTU) promoted the issue
in a non-partisan manner, pressuring politicians to enact dry
legislation. The League and its allies were successful in
achieving various local option measures (laws that allowed voters
of a ward or a township to declare themselves free of the liquor
traffic) and, in 1908, in achieving a law that granted counties
the authority to outlaw the liquor traffic. </p>

<p>Although prohibition was a popular reform in the state, the
issue deeply divided Ohioans. In 1909, witnessing the success of
the League in achieving county option legislation, and fearing
that it might achieve state-wide prohibition, the brewers
organized a counter-attack. Beer had become the largest single
source of beverage alcohol in the United States during the 1880s,
and the brewing industry was the most profitable of the liquor
trades. Persons of German ancestry dominated the American brewing
industry, and they worked closely with the German-American
Alliance, an organization popular in German-American communities.
The brewers had always supplied lobbyists and campaign funds to
thwart the <tt>prohibitionists</tt>. In 1909 the Ohio brewers
decided to try to reform their industry, to reduce the number of
saloons in the state dramatically, and to have legislation
enacted that would ensure that saloon keepers were citizens of
&quot;good character.&quot; Led by Percy Andreae, the Ohio
brewers used their ample financial resources and political skills
to conduct a propaganda campaign to countervail that of the drys,
and to mobilize wets in support of measures that would weaken the
dry hold in the state's politics. </p>

<p>The result was that after 1910 the Anti-Saloon League
encountered stiff opposition in the state's legislature. The drys
could, however, try to achieve state-wide prohibition through the
referendum. The Ohio Constitution permitted citizens to petition
to have amendments placed on the ballot for decision directly by
the voters. In campaigning for state-wide prohibition through the
referendum, League leaders knew they could count on only about
400,000 voters (of a total well over 1,000,000) to support
prohibition. Nevertheless, the League leaders believed they had
little choice but to push referendum campaigns if they were going
to achieve state-wide prohibition in Ohio. Although the brewers
and their wet allies could outspend the drys, the drys hoped to
make up the deficit through the righteousness of their cause and
the resulting reform zeal. After about 1910 public opinion across
the nation seemed to be turning in favor of prohibition. The
League believed that conducting referendum campaigns in Ohio
would educate the public futher to the virtues of prohibition. </p>

<p>The League engineered referendums in 1915 and 1917, which it
lost. The League was finally victorious in 1918, narrowly winning
a state-wide victory. In 1917 and 1918, James A. White, the
Superintendent of the Ohio Anti-Saloon League, organized an
&quot;Ohio Dry Federation&quot; to mobilize all of the state's
temperance and prohibition groups, including the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union. In 1917 the Federation budgeted
$450,000 for the campaign, and in 1918, $500,000, enormous sums
for the day. The advertisements that you will see were part of
that expenditure. </p>

<p>The broadsides that we are providing were apparently intended
for publication in the state's newspapers. Many of them contain
patriotic references to the mobilization for the First World War.
Although nationally political sentiment had clearly developed in
support of a prohibition amendment to the federal constitution
before the United States declared war in 1917, the Ohio Dry
Federation propagandists were looking for every advantage to win
over a majority of the state's voters. </p>
