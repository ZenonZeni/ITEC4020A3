<A NAME="Dare"</A><H1>Daring To Know What You Want</H1>
<H3>by Lynne Whiteley Novy, MFCC</H3>

A gorgeous woman in her mid-20s leaned toward me, the look on her face an invitation to conspiracy. 
<BR>"What I want," she said, as though the words themselves were dangerous, "is to know what I want."	
<BR><BR>She proceeded to list all the things that she did not want, including living at home with her parents, her secretarial job and being 15 pounds "too chubby."	
<BR><BR>When she wound down, I threw out the obvious: "So, then, what DO you want?" Startled, as though she hadn't expected the question outright, she drew back and gripped her hands in her lap. "I don't know," she said.	I waited. After a while, she said, "Maybe this isn't such a good idea after all." Again, I waited. "It doesn't really matter," she said. More waiting. "It's not possible." Silence. "I probably can't, anyway." Still I said nothing. 	
<BR><BR>Finally, in exasperation, as though she thought me too slow-witted to comprehend anyway, she yelled: "I want to be a rock star!" "Sounds good to me," I shouted back.	
<BR><BR>How come it's so dangerous to say what we want? After all, it's a natural act. Kids do it all the time. As adults, though, I think it's risky business to tell the truth about what we want for two reasons: 1) We're afraid we can't have it. 2) We're afraid we can.	
<BR><BR>If we imagine we can't have it, we're left to deal with all the feelings of undeservability, disappointment and limitation with which we surround ourselves. If we decide we can have it, we're forced to face up to actually doing what it would take to make it happen.	
<BR><BR>What a rotten double-bind deal. So, what do we do? Well, we do the wise thing, of course. We pretend not to know. Or, even better, we decide not to want anything at all.	<BR><BR>Sounds good. In fact, some of us make a case for this as a major step toward enlightenment. Pointing to Eastern philosophies, we note that since desire is the root of all suffering, we're wise not to want. We declare desirelessness is highly desirable state. Yes, this sounds good. As with all things that sound too good to be true, however, there's an obvious catch: Pretending not to want does not desirelessness make.	
<BR><BR>To consider it another way, here's a question: Is Mother Hubbard's dog no longer hungry just because she finds the cupboard bare? Not at all. In fact, the dog with no bone will eventually begin to chew on Mother Hubbard!	
<BR><BR>Like hungry dogs, we all want. And want. And want. If we pretend we don't, we either starve or end up unhappily chewing on wrong bones. True wanting, wishing and desiring are instruments of our inner guidance system. To ignore them is to deny access to our own hearts.	
<BR><BR>"Yeah, but what's the point of admitting I want to be a rock star?" said the young woman in my office. "What are the odds of my actually making it?" "I don't know," I said. "But all bets are definitely off if you never declare yourself."	
<BR><BR>Daring to say what we want gets us unstuck and sets things in motion. It's also an act of courage because it leads us to the next layer of questions: Do we want this for its own sake? Is it our heart's true desire? Or is it a means to some other end?	
<BR><BR>Here's where things get dangerous again. Sometimes we uncover hidden motives. Things that we think we shouldn't want, maybe, or things we'd like to avoid. Does the budding rock star genuinely want to sing her heart out on a strobe-lit stage for throbbing crowds? Or is her wish an exciting and elaborate cover plot to escape a boring life that's too attached to overly protective parents? Either way, saying what she wants leads towards her heart's truth.	
<BR><BR>Unless we're willing to say what we want, we go against ourselves. We deny our heart's desire. And if we don't follow our heart's desire, I think we relinquish joy. 	
Risky business, all right.

<A NAME="Cognitive"</A><H1>Cognitive Therapy</H1>
<H3>by Carol Hasenick, MFCC</H3>

Cognitive Therapy began in the 1960s when Aron Beck tried to prove that depression was anger turned inward. A psychoanalytically trained psychiatrist, Beck listened to the free associations, dreams and conversations of depressed people.	 
<BR><BR>He was surprised to find that depressed people had many depressing or negative thoughts which objectively appeared to be false. His curiosity led him to develop ways to question these thoughts and change beliefs. People were less depressed when their thoughts were more accurate.	
<BR><BR>Research has improved on the techniques and enlarged their applicability. Today Cognitive Therapy is useful for depression anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, phobias, personality disorders and relationship difficulties. Children, teens, adults, individuals and couples can all be helped using Cognitive Therapy.	
<BR><BR>Life experiences require that we somehow make sense of them. The resulting beliefs affect our behavior and mood. A child growing up in a home where he is constantly criticized may grow up with the core belief "I'm not good enough." This core belief is the root of behaviors, thoughts and moods. This person may be unassertive, may be an under-achiever, may think he is not adequate in his career, relationships or sports, and his moods might include depression and anxiety. The same core belief could result in different behavior, thoughts and moods in another person.	
<BR><BR>Cognitive Therapy is collaborative--client and therapist bring their expertise into the therapy. Clients are taught to notice their moods, then to become aware of the thoughts that accompany them. These skills are first taught in the session. The client then practices until the skill is able to be used in even the most difficult situations. Next the client is encouraged to approach his thoughts with curiosity, rather than from belief in a thought. There is a questioning: "What evidence supports my belief?" Clients also find that they may do a behavioral experiment outside of the session to collect more information.	
<BR><BR>Sometimes the client discovers that he needs to learn more skills, such as how to be assertive, how to make small talk at a party, or how to arrange his time to be productive at school or work. Role play, reading, classes, and talks with friends may be ways of gaining skills. Together the client and therapist use their expertise and creativity to customize the correct tools for the client.	
<BR><BR>When problems have been long-standing, other methods are used to change beliefs. These include a thorough review of the client's childhood in a much different way than most other therapies employ. Other techniques are used to change the prejudicial beliefs. Courage and tenacity are required to form more accurate beliefs.	
<BR><BR>Cognitive Therapy can come to a close when the client no longer jumps to his old conclusions, but instead considers the evidence to find out what is true. He has learned tools to prevent or decrease the severity of relapse.
