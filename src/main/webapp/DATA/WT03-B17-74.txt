<P>R. Todd Smith was raised on adventure.  Living in the north woods of Minnesota as a child, he spent a great deal of time back country canoeing, camping and hunting in a land where timber wolves still howl as you drift off to sleep at night, and winter camping means braving temperatures of minus 40.
Todd learned to scuba dive in 1981 while majoring in geology and aquatic biology at the University of Minnesota, Duluth.  Since Lake Superior is full of wrecks and often covered with ice, technical diving became a natural passion.
<P>Todd's accomplishments in the field of scuba training are numerous.  He has been a PADI instructor since 1984 and a PADI course director for eight years.  In 1990 he wrote the PADI Ice Diver Instructor Specialty Course Outline, which remains the definitive instructional tool on the topic.  He is also an instructor trainer for the International Association of Nitrox and Technical Divers, and specializes in wreck, ice and deep technical and mixed gas training.
<P>Todd's diving history includes over 1,000 technical ice cave and wreck dives in such meccas as Truk Lagoon, Isle Royale in Lake Superior, Torpedo alley on the East Coast, northern Florida and of course Resolute Bay in the High Arctic.  Todd is also an accomplished mountaineer, photographer, canoeist and marksman. He and his wife Anita, also an accomplished technical diver, live in Boston.
