DEMAND FOR SKIN RESURFACING KEYS TODAY'S
SURGICAL LASER SALES

By Curt Werner
For those companies canny enough to capitalize on the trend, falling
reimbursements and the search for private pay patients have proven
to be the salvation for manufacturers in the surgical laser segment.
Baby Boomers closing in on their fifties have spawned the latest
rage--laser skin resurfacing--and turned it into a mini-bonanza for
smart, technologically adept vendors. What's more, physicians in
several specialties can perform the procedures, including
dermatologists, plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and
ophthalmologists, which broadens the universe of purchasers for the
machines and moves them from the hospital to the physician's
office.

But for vendors that have fallen behind in turning their products into
multi-use tools, the past few years have been a trying time.

Like presidential polls, the surgical laser market is subject to fast-
changing national mood swings. Just two years ago, lasers that
were used to correct severe snoring problems were the hot tickets.
But that market has faded.

The key to success in sales of today's sophisticated, expensive
lasers is finding a range of uses for them. Said one capital
equipment contracting executive for a major group purchasing
organization, "When you spend about $100,000 for a laser, you
want to make sure it doesn't end up sitting around gathering dust in
a corner somewhere."

Credit manufacturers and the medical community for finding scores
of applications for lasers. Medical miracles like excising cancerous
tissue and cells, coronary angioplasty, and a variety of laparoscopic
surgeries are part of the laser equation. But so is removing
somewhat more benign unwanted things like warts and wrinkles. In
fact, it is precisely that "aesthetics market" that drives the surgical
laser segment today.

And what powers that aesthetics market is the public itself.
Providers and surgical laser manufacturers have literally teamed up
in several cases to promote laser skin resurfacing. They have
capitalized on the yen for reversing the aging process by spreading
the word about the possibilities of surgical lasers through countless
newspaper and consumer magazine articles, network news shows
and even infomercials.

Financially speaking, probably the best part of this scenario for
physicians and vendors alike is the fact that men and women who go
to their doctors for laser skin resurfacing are that most precious of
commodities these managed care days: private pay patients. Few
insurers will pay for elective skin resurfacing procedures. "Doctors
are looking for private pay patients, and aesthetics fits right in," says
Karen Amburgey, vice president of marketing for Sharplan Lasers,
Inc., a manufacturer that is based in Allendale, N.J., listed on the
American Stock Exchange, but owned by an Israeli corporation,
Laser Industries, Ltd., Tel Aviv.

For Sharplan and its competitors, like Coherent, Inc., Palo Alto,
Calif., Heraeus Surgical, Milpitas, Calif., and the dozens of upstart
companies with revenues below the half million dollar mark, the
stakes are big and the rewards may be great. According to a June
1995 report published by Frost & Sullivan, Mountain View, Calif.,
the worldwide surgical laser market topped $203 million in 1994.
Factoring in a growth rate of 12.8% in 1995 and 14.1% to 15.4%
through 1998, the market will swell to $429 million globally by the
year 2000. The U.S. dominates in laser revenues, holding more
than 55% of the market, the report said.

Laser's "Swiss Army Knife"

Surgical solid-state lasers and surgical gas lasers will continue to
garner the largest share of the dollars by far. Some relatively new
laser technology is beginning to have an impact on the market,
particularly on the solid-state side. Leading that technology race are
holmium:yttrium aluminum garnet (or Ho:YAG) and
neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) lasers. Ruby lasers and potassium
titanyl phosphate (KTP) devices are also in the solid-state market.

The Ho:YAG laser is rising in importance in the orthopedics market.
This type, known as the "Swiss Army Knife" of lasers, has been in
use for about six years, mostly in arthroscopy and diskectomy
(though high-powered Ho:YAG devices have been on the scene for
less than three years). Reflecting the trend for multi-use
applications, Ho:YAG lasers, which cost between $40,000 and
$150,000 depending on power capabilities, are being utilized in
general surgery, urology, neurosurgery, lithotripsy, angioplasty and
dentistry. Because of their ability to be used in blood and saline
environments, Ho:YAGs are also being wheeled into the surgical
suite for gynecological procedures.

A March 1995 report from ECRI, Plymouth Meeting, Pa., the
respected technological assessment company, cautioned hospital
laser purchasers about the high price tag, but added, "The ability of
a laser to be used in several specialties may help justify its
acquisition." ECRI recommended that hospitals that plan to acquire
only one laser bring in the CO2 laser (for its precise cutting ability
and low cost) or the Ho:YAG/Nd:YAG combination laser, which
can be used for many types of procedures. Combination lasers, like
those produced by Coherent, Inc., sell for approximately $150,000.
At the same time, ECRI said that the Ho:YAG laser is "poised for
rapid and widespread use."

Here's how a few of the players in the laser market are handling the
sales, marketing and the major trends in the industry today:

Sharplan's Strength In Snoring And Aesthetics

Although the laparoscopy market has been a "mainstay market" for
Sharplan since the mid-1970s, more recently the snoring and
aesthetics markets have been the keys to its success. Through the
first nine months of 1995, the company had $36.5 million in sales,
up 26% from the same period in 1994. Sales of more than $50
million (up 36%) are expected for 1995. According to Sharplan's
Amburgey, her company splits the aesthetics market evenly with
Coherent (45% each), with the remainder going to smaller, low-end
companies.

The Silk Touch(TM) laser line is Sharplan's biggest seller. Like
other vendors' product lines, several versions are available.
Products range from a compact 40-watt model to a high-powered
100-watt device, varying in price from $70,000 to $130,000. The
Silk Touch is not intended to be limited to hospital use, and its
pricing is aimed at the broader physician's office market. In its
presentation to physicians, Sharplan touts its laser as the "Gold
Standard" for aesthetic CO2 laser surgery.

According to Amburgey, selling to the office market is relatively
simple since the number of decision-makers is limited and physician
autonomy is strong. But even office-based physicians want
flexibility. For example, an ear, nose and throat doctor in a group
practice setting may also work with physicians who perform skin
resurfacing with the same machine. But in the hospital market, she
told HIT, managed care has made providers very price sensitive.
And while Sharplan markets its product to hospitals, hospitals are
marketing the product to physicians. "Hospitals use lasers to entice
physicians to perform their procedures in the hospital rather than in
their offices in order to bring revenue into the hospital," Amburgey
said.

Sharplan uses medical journal advertising only as a supplement to
build name recognition, as it is doing in the ophthalmic market.
Instead, it places heavy emphasis on courses. This is where the
company can educate doctors about the benefits of the various
procedures, allow them to mingle with their peers, then make their
buying decisions. Most physicians come to the courses already
decided, Amburgey said. Courses sponsored by Sharplan and
others are everywhere, just as they were with the snoring
phenomenon.

Sharplan makes sure that the public is exposed to hot, new laser
procedures such as work on leg veins, hair removal and
photorefractive keratectomy (the subject of next month's Health
Industry Today Market Memo). This is where the company believes
the payoff is. To stimulate public interest, and to help its physician
customers sell their services, Sharplan provides a slick package of
marketing aids that includes videos, brochures, slides and counter
cards complete with striking "before and after" shots. Amburgey
and her staff have been successful in keeping laser skin resurfacing
in the public eye with articles placed in publications like Self
(August 1995), Allure (June 1995) and Vogue (September 1995).

The strategy seems to be working. "Skin resurfacing is peaking now
but should go on for another six to 12 months before winding
down," Amburgey said. She estimates that about 150,000 patients
have already been treated with Sharplan lasers, which are used by
about 750 physicians in the U.S.

Heraeus Surgical

LaserSonics(R) is Heraeus' laser division, and it has been in
operation for more than 20 years. Privately held Heraeus, which
was founded in 1851 and is headquartered in Germany, also has an
integrated operating room division that offers products such as
surgical lighting systems, surgical tables and video systems. An
arrangement with Minneapolis-based CVAC Corp. gives it access to
a smoke evacuation system as well, and all of the above can be sold
with LaserSonics' products. The laser lines include a series of CO2
and Nd:YAG lasers, along with accessories such as hand pieces and
micro-manipulators.

LaserSonics' CO2 lasers, introduced in late 1994, are used by
gynecologists, ENT physicians, and more recently, in dermatology
and plastic surgery away from the hospital setting. The company's
Nd:YAG lasers are used by urologists, gastroenterologists, thoracic
surgeons and ENT docs.

The Paragon(TM) CO2 laser was released in January 1995 and
launched in April 1995, and since then, sales have "exceeded
expectations," a company spokesperson said. The Paragon line is
popular for laser skin resurfacing and is used in both private practice
and hospital settings.

In January 1995, Heraeus introduced the Hercules 5100 ("the
smallest, 100 watt Nd:YAG laser ever developed" and the "first
Nd:YAG laser to combine high power in a convenient and portable
design"). The device is on a 15"x20" base that allows it to fit into
large and small surgical suites, plus it has standard power
requirements to sidestep special electrical connections. It's also "five
times faster than any other Nd:YAG laser on the market," the
company says, which allows surgeons to work faster and still
provide effective coagulation and minimal tissue trauma during
surgery.

Heraeus has a 35-member direct sales force, with some devoted to
laser sales, some to the O.R. equipment, plus a few distributors to
cover sales in outlying areas. They also have "clinical instructors"
on the payroll--nurses that handle inservice and add credibility to
laser sales. Heraeus also has a 20-member field service department
that supports both O.R. and laser sales, something of an oddity
among laser vendors.

For Heraeus, the titles of purchasing decision makers have not
changed much over the past few years. It's still a group decision due
to the high cost involved, and the group includes purchasing staff,
O.R. supervisors/managers, biomedical and administration. "The
docs still drive the decision by their product preferences," said
Doreen Smillie, marketing communications manager for Heraeus.
"We start with the physicians, and they will drive it for you, but you
need buy-in from the others."

As it does for its competitors, multi-use sells. Says Smillie, "It's
easier to get an approval when two or three departments can use one
machine. That's where our strength is, along with merging our O.R.
and laser equipment."

Increasing the number of national accounts tops the Heraeus agenda
for 1996. "As a company goal, we're trying to add more national
accounts in 1996," said Smillie. Heraeus has an agreement with St.
Louis-based AmeriNet. Craig Lingel, the recently promoted vice
president of sales, handles national accounts.

Heraeus has positioned its laser prices below market leader
Coherent. "We're $20,000 to $30,000 cheaper than Coherent,"
Smillie said. The company's 1996 prices: 50-watt $65,000; 70-watt
$73,000; 100-watt $89,000. Heraeus' 70- and 100-watt models are
used predominantly in hospitals. The 50-watt models are intended
for private practice settings.

To promote its laser products, Heraeus presents many workshops in
specialty settings such as gynecology, urology and ENT.
Workshops are presented along with CME credits in an unbiased
institution.

Heraeus also relies heavily on trade shows. Among them are the
Assn. of Operating Room Nurses, American Academy of
Dermatology, American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery,
American College of Gynecology, American Academy of
Gynecological Laparoscopy and the American Urology Assn.
Heraeus abandoned the American College of Surgeons in 1993.
"We didn't get a lot out of it," Smillie told HIT.

Heraeus doesn't place many journal ads "because decision makers
vary and it's hard to find publications that hit both of our product
lines." The only ad that did appear in 1995 was found in Surgical
Products magazine, and there are no plans for more or less than that
in 1996. Direct mail efforts are made in conjunction with trade
shows.

BAXTER'S SPIN-OFF GAMBIT: A 1993 IDEA WHOSE TIME
HAS COME

By Curt Werner
Jim Tobin and Tony White shared an enjoyable laugh a few days
after their Thanksgiving dinners when Baxter International
announced plans to spin off its hospital supply business. The two
former top-level Baxter executives, chief architects of exactly the
same spin-off plan that the company stubbornly repudiated two
years ago, left Deerfield in December 1993 in the wake of a power
struggle with chairman and CEO Vernon R. Loucks over the plan.
Now, Tobin told Health Industry Today in an exclusive interview
that he feels "vindicated" over the outcome. "I can't find anything
that is different than what we did two years ago," he said. "It was a
good plan then, and they wasted two years in not implementing it."
Tobin and White's distribution spin-off plan has been on the shelf
since November 1993.

During those two years, Baxter has floundered a bit, and its market
share in the medical-surgical distribution business has been flat, a
particularly disheartening development for Baxter shareholders,
since the company's main competitor, Owens & Minor, Inc.,
Richmond, Va., has fought off some doldrums of its own and
jumped its share to more than 21% in 1994 from about 8% in 1990.

Today, Tobin serves as president and chief operating officer of
Biogen Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech concern, while
White is an executive with Perkins-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, Conn.
And unlike his former employer, Tobin's company is doing just
fine. Biogen just received approval from an FDA advisory
committee for Avonex, a naturally occurring beta interferon drug
that is used to slow the progression of multiple sclerosis. Biogen
stock shot up about $11 in one mid-December week to about $64.
Baxter's stock price languished in the low $20 range for months,
before perking up of late to the low $40s as analysts hailed the
ultimate implementation of Tobin's bold strategy.

Many say that Baxter's gambit has returned the company to its 1985
American Hospital Supply pre-merger look. That was the year the
two big corporations merged in a $3.8 billion blockbuster deal.
Baxter had 1994 sales of approximately $9.32 billion. The spin-off
would split the company into two companies with sales of about $5
billion each.

"Milking HS Into Mediocrity"

Now that the spin-off has been set into motion and the genie is out
of the bottle, Tobin believes that the new Baxter Hospital Supply
(HS), by whatever name it chooses, must look at getting bigger.
"HS business, when the debt is split, is around book value. It
makes sense [for an investment firm] to buy it from Baxter, install
cost-oriented management, double the profits and take it public for
big bucks." He feels that investors could "use it, fix it and make it
the core of building a powerful medical supply company.

"Hospital Supply is a good, strong business even though margins
were thin two years ago and they're thin now (Editor's note:
Published estimates are that Baxter's hospital supplies and
management side has a 5% to 6% profit margin, while the Baxter
International technology side comes in at between 14% and 15%.).
But the business is worse off than it was two years ago. The board
looked at the performance over the past two years and decided to
head back to Plan A.

"The structures [of Baxter's manufacturing and distribution
divisions] are vastly different and need to be run differently. As long
as the numbers are aggregated, you'll always under-invest in one
side or another. And running a business for cash is like going out of
business slowly. They've been milking the HS business into
mediocrity."

Unlocking Baxter Distribution Books

Everyone has a theory about Baxter's big move, and the somewhat
unexpected consensus from the vendor community seems to be that
Baxter's plan is good for the industry as a whole. Tom Sherry, vice
president of sales and marketing for Owens & Minor, was
practically elated over the news. "It's great for Owens, and it's great
for distribution. Now we will have an industry comparison. We'll
be able to show the cost of a sale, and we'll be able to show that
we're the low-cost provider." Sherry predicts Baxter will intensify
its marketing efforts on behalf of its stockless/just-in-time ValueLink
Division and its Procedure Based Delivery System (advanced
custom packs).

Ted Almon, who heads another Baxter distribution competitor,
Providence, R.I.-based Claflin Co., called the new Baxter "a
souped-up American Hospital Supply" that could become a better
competitor in the distribution market. He envisions a stronger
relationship between Baxter and branded manufacturers in the wake
of the spin-off. However, Almon cautioned that not all the pieces
will necessarily fall neatly into place for the new Baxter. "If growing
pains and start-up problems and a lack of strategic direction surface,
the result could prove to be an advantage for Baxter's competition."

Stronger words came from Pete DeBusk, president of DeRoyal
Industries, Inc., Powell, Tenn., who is convinced that shareholder
pressure drove Baxter's decision. "It takes the old Baxter and its
blood substitute and greatly appreciates the value of its stock," he
told HIT. "Vernon Loucks is running the show, and he wants to
enhance the company's stock value, realign the company and make
the industry happy. He can't lose.

"It's the first wise thing he [Loucks] has done in a long while."

DeBusk believes that Baxter must "realign the distribution business
and run it mean and lean because it won't have the manufacturing
side to carry it. Distribution has to stand on its own and fight.
Baxter will take on a whole new look and realize it must look at the
margins it must have in order to make it in today's market. It's gone
from a consumer side to a supplier side economy because the
services required of customers today are expensive and distributors
are finding out they've under-priced their product tremendously."

As soon as news of Baxter's split hit the national media, the rumor
mill began to churn out a few interesting possibilities. One was that
a number of suitors were in line for Baxter's distribution arm.
Names of heavyweight drug wholesalers surfaced, such as San
Francisco-based McKesson Corp. and Orange, Calif.-based Bergen
Brunswig Corp. The Houston-based food giant, Sysco Corp., was
another name in the mill, though Baxter's reportedly long
relationship with Sysco's arch-rival, Kraft Foods, could preclude
such a transaction.

Post-spin-off rumors have also persisted that Baxter International
was in talks aimed at acquiring the National Medical Care Inc.
kidney-dialysis business operated by W.R. Grace & Co., an
acquisition that would carry a steep price tag estimated at about $4.5
billion. Three weeks after those rumors arose, however, little has
occurred, and observers have privately questioned Baxter's desire to
enter the provider field.

LEAVES FALL, FUR FLIES AT BAXTER IN NOVEMBER

As usual, it was another extremely hectic month of November at
Baxter International. The saga opens in November 1985 when
Baxter merged with American Hospital Supply. Then, the timeline
skips to November 1992, when Baxter announced plans for its ill-
fated $376 million acquisition of the medical-surgical distributor
Stuart Medical, Inc., Greensburg, Pa., a controversial deal that was
aborted just a few short months later in February 1993. Also in
November 1992, Baxter spun off its Northbrook, Ill.-based
Caremark International Inc. unit, which it purchased for $586
million in 1987.

There's more. It was November 1993 when Baxter and San Diego-
based American Healthcare Systems announced the signing of a
five-year, $4 billion corporate agreement, then the largest of its kind
in the industry. In November 1994, the industry was again
surprised when Baxter was named the fourth authorized distribution
agent of Irving, Texas-based VHA Inc.

In the most recent November, of course, Baxter said it would spin
off its hospital supply operations.

Next November? Who knows? Mail (5350 So. Roslyn, Suite 400,
Englewood, CO 80111), phone (303-290-8500) or fax (303-290-
9025) reader predictions to Health Industry Today. We'll print the
best ideas next month.

MOST VENDORS BULLISH, UNDAUNTED BY LATEST GPO
MEGA-MERGER

Medical-surgical supply vendors in general reacted positively to the
stunning news of the latest giant merger between group purchasing
organizations. In late November, Charlotte, N.C.-based SunHealth
Alliance announced plans to join with two other newly merged
buying groups--Premier Health Alliance, Westchester, Ill., and
American Healthcare Systems, San Diego--in a move that
confounded widespread rumors that had SunHealth headed toward
an alliance with Irving, Texas-based VHA Inc. At press time, the
deal was awaiting ratification by SunHealth's 152 shareholders.

The big merger creates a huge, highly compliant, far-flung health
care network that includes more than 240 owner systems that own
or operate 650 hospitals and other assorted facilities, in addition to
another 1,000 affiliate members in all 50 states representing
approximately 315,000 licensed beds. Estimates are that total annual
purchasing volume for the new network could top the $10 billion
mark. SunHealth alone chipped in about $2 billion to that total.
However, lurking in the shadows is a degree of uncertainty spurred
by rumors of member defections from the new group due to
disapproval of the merger terms or the addition of competing
hospitals to the new network.

Pete DeBusk, president of DeRoyal Industries, Inc., Powell, Tenn.,
is convinced that the formation of the super-group will help his
company. DeRoyal had contracts with SunHealth and Premier, but
not with AmHS, so the new network will increase DeBusk's
opportunities significantly. However, he is just as convinced that the
big network's buying power won't be able to reduce prices as much
as some think it can. "Prices are on the bottom," he told HIT. "We
can't operate at the margins we have now." In fact, DeBusk predicts
"tremendous" price increases for 1996. "It's bad. Rises in raw
materials prices have never been passed on, and manufacturers have
been devastated.

"The industry must sit up and take notice that there will be further
price increases, especially for distribution, and it's to our benefit to
support distributors. We shouldn't take a hostile approach to the
needs of the distribution business," he said.

Another happy customer is Jon Mills, president of Medline
Industries, Inc., Mundelein, Ill., whose company signed a two-
year, $4 million-a-year contract with SunHealth last summer. Like
DeBusk, Mills praised the new combination. He believes the move
to Premier/AmHS will give his company an opportunity to increase
its sales. Mills, also like DeBusk, feels that the new network won't
drive prices further downward. "Any GPO has great power
already," he said. "Anybody would be honored to have their
business, but most prices are as low as they can be right now."

Not everything is rosy, however. The formation of the supergroup
does leave some unanswered questions. Several observers feel that
vendors are going to have to sharpen their pencils even further than
before, and some are edgy over possible demands of the new group.
A few may even walk away from their contracts, frustrated over
sharp administrative fees, reporting requirements, contract
implementation demands and approaches to the supply contracts
themselves. Other vendors may be perplexed over their future and
wary of possible leadership clashes within the new group.

There's general agreement, however, that the rise of the new group
(by whatever name it chooses) is a daring stroke. Said Kim Bearce
of NCI, Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., "Nothing since
Columbia/HCA is as brave and as bold." Few could argue.

APPLIED VASCULAR GAINS FDA NOD FOR CORONARY
STENT TRIALS

Applied Vascular Engineering, Inc., Santa Rosa, Calif., will begin
clinical trials for its coronary stent delivery system following the
FDA's investigational device exemption (IDE) approval for its Micro
Stent(TM). The result is believed to be the first clinical trial to utilize
the Palmaz-Schatz stent from Johnson & Johnson Interventional
Systems, Warren, N.J., as the concurrent control. For now, the
J&J product is the only coronary stent approved for the reduction of
restenosis in the U.S.

Currently sold outside the U.S., the Micro Stent system is also
designed to prevent restenosis, the reclosing of arteries opened by
an angioplasty procedure.

The clinical trial is called SMART (Study of Micro Stent's Ability to
limit Restenosis Trial). SMART is believed to be the first device-
approval study to incorporate the use of ticlopidine, which is
emerging as the primary anticoagulation medication for stent
patients. The trial, which began in November, will involve up to 20
U.S. medical centers with patient enrollment expected to last
approximately six months.

BAXTER ACQUIRES PSICOR, A PERFUSIONIST PROVIDER,
FOR $80 MILLION

Just days before the announcement of its controversial split, Baxter
Healthcare Corp., McGaw Park, Ill., disclosed that it had acquired
San Diego-based Psicor, a provider of cardiovascular perfusion
services to hospitals that perform open heart surgery. The
acquisition cost Baxter approximately $80 million.

The purchase is designed to bolster Baxter's ability to offer
customers a set of products and services on a capitated basis. Psicor
is said to have about 400 hospitals as its customers and reported
1994 sales of about $82 million. The deal follows Baxter's purchase
earlier this year of Seta, Inc., another company that offers
perfusionists--clinicians who operate heart-lung bypass machines
used during open heart procedures--to hospitals on a contract basis.

PICKER, AT&T CAPITAL AGREE TO EQUIPMENT
FINANCING PACT

Picker International, Cleveland, and AT&T Capital Corp.,
Morristown, N.J., have become equal equity partners in a joint
venture that will provide customer financing to hospitals, clinics and
other users of Picker's medical imaging systems and related
equipment. The 10-year agreement is expected to result in financing
arrangements of as much as $400 million during the first five years
alone.

Picker Financial Group has amassed net leased assets of $85 million
in the three years since it was founded. That rapid growth led the
Group to seek a partner with international capabilities.

The partnership will likely result in a wider array of true-lease and
conditional-sale financial products, as well as more customer
services during the lease term. The annual worldwide leasing market
for imaging equipment has been estimated at approximately $3
billion.

COMDISCO SURVEY: IMAGING SALES SUFFER AGAIN IN
1995

With all modalities reporting increases in average age, the year 1995
marked a second straight sub-par year for diagnostic imaging
equipment sales, according to the fifth annual study of acquisition
trends by Comdisco, Inc., Rosemont, Ill. The survey polled more
than 3,600 hospitals. The bad news was worst for the magnetic
resonance imaging sector, where the average age of installed MRIs
rose to 5.5 years in 1995 from 3.1 years as recently as 1992. A full
70% of all MRIs are now more than three years old, compared with
just 35% in 1992.

The study found that the oldest and most pervasive technology in the
market remains radiography/fluoroscopy (R&F). The average age of
equipment in that sector has now hit 10.1 years, up from 7.9 years
in 1992. About two-thirds of current R&F systems are more than
seven years old, and one in five are more than 15 years old. The
systems are installed in 95% of all U.S. hospitals.

On the CT side, 75% of scanners are now more than three years old,
up from 64% in 1994. Almost one-third (31%) of hospitals
surveyed have cardiac catheterization labs installed, significantly
more than the 20% that had cath labs in 1993. Eighty-four percent of
nuclear medicine devices in surveyed hospitals are now more than
three years old.

Comdisco Medical Equipment Group president Kenneth A.
Halverson blames "market-driven reform" for the bad news. Part of
that reform is centered on integrated delivery networks, the
emergence of which has created redundancies in many modalities.
He added, however, that "the tide may be turning," since his
company, which provides equipment leasing and other services,
entered 1996 with a record backlog of orders. Comdisco had
another record year in reconditioned diagnostic imaging equipment
in 1995, with shipments totaling $28 million, up 17% from 1994,
when shipments jumped 68% from the previous year.

SMITH & NEPHEW TAKES BLUE PENCIL TO
BEWILDERING BUSINESS UNIT NAME LINEUP

As part of a broader strategy calling for names of the group's
businesses to reflect the medical disciplines they serve, a
reorganization--including a name change--has been instituted by
Memphis, Tenn.-based Smith & Nephew Richards. Under the
changes, which took effect Jan. 1, the company is now known as
Smith & Nephew Orthopaedics. The new unit will be headed by the
company's current president, Larry Papasan.

There's more. Smith & Nephew Richards' medical specialties
division based in Bartlett, Tenn., will become Smith & Nephew
ENT (ear, nose and throat). James Duncan, president of the medical
specialties division, will stay on as president of Smith & Nephew
ENT.

The orthopedic accessories and continuous passive motion
rehabilitation exercise equipment product lines, currently part of the
medical specialties division, are being reassigned to Smith &
Nephew Orthopaedics and Smith & Nephew Rehabilitation
respectively. Early in 1995, the old Smith & Nephew Dyonics
became Smith & Nephew Endoscopy while Smith & Nephew
Roylan became Smith & Nephew Rehabilitation. Smith & Nephew
Richards will remain a principal brand name for both Smith &
Nephew Orthopaedics and Smith & Nephew ENT products.

ETHICON ENDO ACQUIRES ULTRASONIC INSTRUMENT
MANUFACTURER

Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, is the only company to
offer a full line of both videoscopic (minimally invasive surgery)
and ultrasonic surgical instruments, following its acquisition of
UltraCision, Inc., Smithfield, R.I. UltraCision is a pioneer in the
area of ultrasonic technology and the developer and manufacturer of
the Harmonic Scalpel(TM), a device that uses ultrasound power to
make surgical incisions with minimal tissue damage. The
acquisition, for undisclosed terms, will boost Ethicon Endo's
product offerings in the area of videoscopic surgery.

The Harmonic Scalpel is used by surgeons in both videoscopic and
open surgical procedures including gall bladder removal,
appendectomy, repair of hiatal hernia, hysterectomy and bladder
neck suspension. The scalpel is connected to a generator that
converts electrical energy to mechanical energy, causing its blade to
vibrate at more than 55,000 hertz to cut tissue and seal blood vessels
simultaneously. Future applications for the device include cardiac
and vascular surgery, plastic and reconstructive surgery,
dermatology and arthroscopic surgery.

IMPROVED DISEASE MANAGEMENT THE GOAL OF
DORNIER/ACOUSTIC IMAGING COMBO

The combination of two manufacturers has created a new single-
source provider of dedicated ultrasound imaging and interventional
therapy delivery systems. The new company, known as Dornier
Medical Systems, Inc. (DMSI), was formed in November through a
combination of Acoustic Imaging Technologies Corp., Phoenix, and
Atlanta-based Dornier Medical Systems, Inc. Acoustic Imaging has
had an eight-year relationship with Dornier Medical.

The development is expected to permit the new company to
accelerate new product development, in particular what the company
calls "a new direction in disease management by integrating
diagnostic imaging and minimally invasive therapy."

DMSI will continue to offer Acoustic Imaging's diagnostic
ultrasound imaging systems to the specialty, general radiology,
mammography and obstetrical markets. The company has led
advances in urologic imaging and interventional therapy systems and
continues to provide lithotripters, lasers and urological tables to
those markets.

STERIS-AMSCO MERGER BRINGS TOGETHER
CENTRALIZED AND DECENTRALIZED PROCESSORS

The $660 million merger of Steris Corp., Mentor, Ohio, with
Pittsburgh-based AMSCO International will capitalize on
complementary sales, operational, manufacturing, product
development and expense control abilities to reach a shifting
customer base. Despite this, the merger surprised many, even
though AMSCO had been involved in merger discussions with an
undisclosed company only a few days prior to the Dec. 18
announcement. Steris is involved in decentralized sterile processing
and surgical support systems, while AMSCO handles centralized
sterile processing and similar support systems.

The deal will merge the North American sales and service
organizations of the two concerns to provide increased account
penetration and new product introduction capabilities. A direct sales
and service force of more than 1,000 field representatives will
emerge following completion of the merger. The new company will
use those capabilities to reach all major acute care provider markets:
hospital, ambulatory and alternate site. It will also place a renewed
emphasis on national accounts, group purchasing, governmental and
other large-volume capital equipment sales, supplies and services
contract business.

According to Steris, the move was spurred by consolidation in
ownership of hospitals and alternate site providers, which is leading
to more use of centralized purchasing.

Bill Sanford will stay on as top executive of the combined Steris
Corp. Two AMSCO executives will join an expanded Steris board
of directors.

BOEHRINGER MANNHEIM DIAGNOSTICS' FAST ASSAY
DIAGNOSES HEART ATTACKS

Sales of a new rapid bedside assay that helps physicians diagnose
heart attacks are under way, and its manufacturer, Boehringer
Mannheim Diagnostics, expects that its speed and ease of use will
translate into big sales for what it feels is a ground-breaking
product. Indianapolis-based Boehringer received 510(k) clearance
(after a six-month wait) to market the Cardiac T(TM) Rapid Assay in
late November.

The assay is based on the company's proprietary market cardiac
troponin T, which is found inside cardiac muscle and is released into
the blood only when cells are damaged.

The Cardiac T is a self-contained, disposable unit approximately
four inches long, less than an inch wide and a quarter-inch thick.
Drops of blood are placed in a well on the device and are quickly
drawn into a sandwich assay impregnated with two distinct types of
monoclonal antibodies, which link to cardiac troponin T in the
sample resulting in a visible color change. Results are obtained at the
bedside without the use of a central lab.

According to Lynda Koester, marketing manager for Boehringer
Mannheim Diagnostics, sales efforts are focusing on emergency
medicine physicians, cardiologists and laboratory personnel. The
product was rolled out to the cardiology market at the recent annual
meeting of the American Heart Assn. in Anaheim, Calif., starting
with a press conference and symposium. The company also
presented the Cardiac T in October for a pre-market look at the
American College of Emergency Physicians meeting, where better
than 700 leads were garnered from the approximately 2,300
registrants. At that meeting, Boehringer Mannheim sent dosed rapid
assays to attendees inviting them to stop by the booth. On the lab
side, Boehringer will display the new product at the American Assn.
for Clinical Chemistry, the Clinical Laboratory Management Assn.
and a number of local and regional sessions. The company utilizes a
speakers bureau for the presentations.

The company has also arranged journal placements in two major
emergency medicine journals, Annals of Emergency Medicine and
Emergency Medicine News, as well as Circulation and the Journal
of Cardiology. Later this year, ads will run in the Journal of
American Cardiology.

Probably the biggest obstacle to Cardiac T sales is overcoming
clinicians' traditional use of other markers and resistance to the new
technology in what is estimated to be an $82 million market in 1996.
To help do that, Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics concentrates on
clinician education led by an evaluation program for its customers.
More than 130 publications and peer review studies are currently
available. Training in the use of Cardiac T is handled by a
combination of videotape tutorials, sales rep time spent with
customers and a policy and procedures manual.

Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics utilizes a sales force made up of
10 specialists and over 100 sales representatives for lab sales
exclusively, in addition to approximately 250 reps on the pharmacy
side. The Cardiac T carries a list price of $30 per test, though group
purchasing organization contracts will discount that price. The
company is engaged in discussions with Oakland, Calif.-based

IMPLANTABLE PUMP MARKS STRATO/INFUSAID'S RE-
ENTRY INTO PAIN MANAGEMENT MARKET

After a five-year hiatus, Strato/Infusaid Inc., re-entered the pain
management market in the fall when the FDA cleared its Infusaid
Model 400 Single Catheter Constant Flow Implantable Pump. The
Norwood, Mass.-based subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., New York, will
go head-to-head with Medtronic, Inc., the Minneapolis-based giant
that until now has had the pain management pump market all to
itself.

Strato/Infusaid was active in the pain management market in the
1980s, before leaving that market in 1990 while awaiting
development and approval of its new device.

To overcome loyalty to the Medtronic product lines, Strato/Infusaid
is playing the cost card. The Model 400 is priced at $4,995, a figure
the company says is less expensive than current alternatives, both
initially and over time. The company says that the total cost over six
months is $18,654, which "compares favorably" with that of
implantable programmable pumps ($21,129), implanted catheters
($31,144) and externalized systems ($38,190). After four years, as
patient survival lengthens, treatment costs for the Model 400 are
$34,828, roughly two-thirds the cost of treatment with implantable
programmable pumps ($49,621), one-fifth the cost of implanted
catheter treatments ($158,572) and one-eighth the cost of treatment
with externalized systems ($273,852).

These figures have not been lost on Strato/Infusaid's target market,
which it defines as 80% anesthesiologists active in pain management
and 20% neurosurgeons. The company met with "extreme success"
last fall during a six-stop national show tour, during which the
response from physicians was positive for the less-expensive new
product, a departure from the scene only 10 years ago when cost
was virtually a non-issue. Another plus for the Model 400 is the fact
that it needs no batteries. With its "inexhaustible" power supply, the
device requires neither programming nor recharging, another
attribute of interest to end-users.

Along with the aggressive show schedule, Strato/Infusaid launched
a direct mail campaign to anesthesiologists and neurosurgeons,
including the 2,800 members of the American Pain Society. Journal
ads are running in Neurosurgery and in Anesthesia and Analgesia.

To sell the Model 400, Strato/Infusaid uses its 32-member direct
sales force plus eight nurses who perform critical inservice
functions. Surgeons, oncologists and community physicians require
training on the device, as do clinicians responsible for refilling
medication (Infumorph, a preservative-free morphine), such as
home health care nurses.

Anne Roussell, Strato/Infusaid's product manager for implantable
pumps, has two objectives for the first 12 months following release.
The first is to re-establish the company's name recognition, while
the second is to capture 20% of the market. She says that the U.S.
pump market for pain management is $30 million and growing at
about 15% a year.

I-FLOW PROMOTES SIMPLE, LOW COST BAND-IT SYRINGE
DELIVERY SYSTEM

I-Flow Corp. is hoping that cost-conscious hospitals will take to a
low-cost, low-tech syringe delivery system that makes use of a
common rubber band to help reduce customers' supply costs when
delivering I.V. medications. The small Irvine, Calif.-based
manufacturer recently received FDA marketing clearance for the
Band-It--after a two-year wait--and is currently seeking one or more
distribution partners to help sell its new product.

The Band-It Syringe Delivery System, all of which is disposable,
consists of a patented syringe driver and a flow control set. The
driver provides the energy to deliver medication from a 10cc Becton
Dickinson syringe. The set controls the flow from the syringe via
restrictor-tubing technology. Currently, two infusion times are
available: 10cc over 15 minutes and 10cc over 30 minutes.

I-Flow says the product not only cuts I.V. supply costs but also
minimizes pharmacy fill-time and storage. To prove its point, the
company has produced a specially priced evaluation package that
gives providers a chance to try the Band-It on patients. The package,
which is aimed at nurses and pharmacists, emphasizes not only
clinical advantages but provides a detailed cost analysis as well. The
cost analysis offers supply costs when using the Band-It set
between two and 12 times. For two uses, the set costs a user $2.47
per dose in supplies. But at a 12-time rate, the cost drops to 60 cents
per dose. I-Flow says that little training time is needed for clinicians.

I-Flow president and CEO Don Earhart says he is looking for
partners ranging from independent medical distributors to full-line
distributors, especially distributors that could bundle the Band-It
with other products.

Once those distributor/partners are found, journal advertising and
direct mail efforts will begin. So far, I-Flow has displayed the
product at last month's 30th annual midyear clinical meeting of the
American Society of Health-System Pharmacists in Las Vegas. The
company plans to exhibit at a number of nursing shows later this
year as well. Both hospitals and alternate care facilities are expected
to be end-users of the Band-It system.

For I-Flow, only a $10 million company, even a modicum of Band-
It sales success will have a major effect on its bottom line.
According to figures Earhart quoted from industry I.V. leaders
Baxter Healthcare Corp., McGaw Park, Ill., and Abbott
Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill., approximately 300 million
antibiotic/anti-infective doses are delivered outside the hospital each
year in the U.S. Although not every dose can fit into a 10cc syringe,
Earhart believes that between 40% and 50% can. In addition, a 20cc
version of the Band-It system is expected to be marketed later this
year.

OUTCOMES STUDIES BECOMING A "MUST" FOR
SUCCESSFUL DEVICE SALES

As demand increases for proof of not only safety and efficacy, but
the economic impact of today's medical devices and pharmaceuticals
(especially biotech drugs), manufacturers in great numbers are
turning to outcomes studies to prove their points to customers. The
cost may be high--from $100,000 into the multimillions for a
complex, peer-reviewed study complete with the accompanying
publicity effort to drive the information--but in many cases, sharp
competition among vendors and cost-conscious, managed care-
influenced providers can make a well-documented outcomes study
the difference between a sale and no sale.

R. Thomas Swem, principal, management consulting, for Boston-
based Deloitte & Touche LLP, is heavily involved in the production
of outcomes studies. He will deliver a keynote address in San Diego
during a Feb. 28-March 1 meeting titled Outcomes Studies for
Medical Devices presented by Global Business Research (1-800-
868-7188).

Swem says that the typical outcomes study on medical devices may
evaluate a new piece of equipment and its effect on a hospital's
department, the effect of a new machine replacing multiple
installations or potential FTE reductions associated with a new
equipment acquisition. Studies on disposable vs. reusable issues
and prepackaged approaches to vs. a la carte procurement are also
common.

A well-produced and promoted outcomes study "makes a coherent,
well-supported case for an outcome that may be somewhat
surprising," he said. An example of such a study was an early
evaluation of the benefits of laparoscopic vs. open surgery.
"Everyone seemed to have a sense that lap cholys were expensive,"
Swem said. "But the benefits proved they overshadow the costs."

Once an outcomes study has been completed, it must be marketed to
potential customers, chiefly physicians. On one occasion, Deloitte &
Touche mailed 300,000 copies of such a study to clinicians. A
popular approach today is to present the study on a video-quality,
PC-based format. To a modern medical device sales force armed
with automation tools, this delivery is a great help in making a case
to physicians.

Despite the best of intentions, manufacturers must overcome a
degree of skepticism in making their outcomes studies credible. This
is done by countering skepticism with hard data--and reams of it.
Swem reports that a toll-free telephone number was set up for one
study to take calls concerning the study. Another time, he invited
doubters to peruse documentation of blinded papers. A well-
prepared outcomes study generates a huge volume of painstakingly
assembled, complicated reports, often including medical records.
Such a study may involve investigative reports from 15 or 20
different institutions.

EXCITEMENT AND FLASH SEEMED MISSING FROM 1995
RSNA SHOW

Although a number of last year's works-in-progress are now
available for purchase, there was general agreement that the 1995
trade show at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in
Chicago produced few, if any, surprises. Even the "tech junkies"
who wandered the vast floor space at Chicago's McCormick Place
to get their fill of new developments reported a lack of eye-openers.
One even went so far as to call the 1995 RSNA "a boring show."
Slow sales--rather than a lack of innovation or imagination--over the
past few years have assumed a rightful role as the culprit for the
missing excitement. There were few, if any, major product
introductions in the big ticket MR and CT segments. Enhancements
substituted for introductions.

Total attendance (60,161, including 23,883 non-exhibitors) was up
6.9% over 1994, when 56,262 viewed the displays on the
373,000sf show floor. By most accounts, vendors pulled back to a
more conservative approach to their presentations, cut the number of
personnel staffing the exhibits and threw fewer and less lavish
parties. Gone too were at least some of the multi-story "cities"
masquerading as booths, which some said signals an approaching
close to the RSNA as the "Disneyland of health care shows."

More administrators than before were on hand. There was also "a
new blending of focus on the radiology department head as the chief
information officer of digital imaging," said Mary Ann Kelly,
director of radiology and facilities for Los Angeles-based Purchase
Connection. She sees a tie-in of all imaging modalities into
information systems "from the viewbox, into the system and onto
the screen."

CR Gains Exposure

As it was with the 1994 show, smaller and faster were the dominant
themes for 1995. Open-architecture, low-end MRI systems were in
abundant supply for $750,000 or less through many vendors. MRI
sales are still down, by between 25% and 40% some say. But open-
architecture could save this segment as the horsepower race draws to
an end.

There were a few hot properties, of course. Computed radiography
(CR) was such an item, with several pieces offered at a "reasonable"
price for the first time. "Until the past year or two, the cost of CR
outweighed the benefits and the capabilities of the systems weren't
fully usable," said one attendee. One CR piece stood out: the direct
radiography prototype developed by DuPont Medical Products,
Newark, Del., that displayed how X-ray transmissions could be
converted into electronic data and presented via a satellite link
between the show floor and Chicago's Loyola University, providing
instant pictures on a monitor.

The competition has begun to heat up as several other manufacturers
have joined the CR chase, most notably major players like Fuji
Medical Systems, Stamford, Conn.; GE Medical Systems,
Milwaukee; Picker International, Cleveland, and Siemens Medical
Systems, Inc., Iselin, N.J. Agfa Technical Imaging, Ridgefield
Park, N.J., and the Health Sciences Division of Eastman Kodak
Co., Rochester, N.Y., are also in the fray. At the meeting, Kodak
and Siemens announced an agreement covering sales and service of
the Kodak Digital Science(TM) CR system 400. Predictions are that
the deluge of vendors will work to drive CR prices down.

The vendors' marketing approaches to CR vary, of course.
Siemens, for example, offers CR as an overall system along with its
Picture Archiving Communication Systems (PACS), while Fuji sells
its version of a horizontal CR table as a standalone item for general
radiography.

More players are entering the dry laser camera market. Until
recently, most felt that the Medical Imaging Systems division of
Polaroid Corp., Cambridge, Mass., had the largest share of the
market to itself with its Helios line. Its new large format Helios
1417 system, which began shipments in 1995, is aimed at the high
end of the market with a list price of about $100,000. Polaroid's
smaller format Helios 810 was introduced in 1993. Now, Agfa has
a prototype on the way, and 3M, St. Paul, Minn., is offering its
version with the 3M Dry View Laser Imaging Systems. 3M, in fact,
announced that it intends to launch its imaging systems and data
storage business as part of an independent, publicly owned
company in mid-1996.

Laser Mammography Debuts

Several attendees were impressed with one of the few truly new
technologies on display: laser mammography. One startup company,
Imaging Diagnostic Systems, Sunrise, Fla., made a splash with its
CTLM (CT Laser Mammography) that utilizes light generated by a
high-speed laser to view the breast. Sales are probably a couple of
years away, however, as clinical trials have yet to begin for the new
technology.

Siemens Enters U.S. Ultrasound Market

The entry by Siemens into a relatively mature U.S. ultrasound
market at a time when most observers feel there are already too
many ultrasound vendors scrambling for market share was a
surprise. Siemens introduced the Sonoline ultrasound system family
at RSNA to go with its CT and MR systems as the company rounds
out its offerings to hospitals. Siemens will face stiff competition
from GE Medical Systems in the ultrasound market in this country.

Remanufactured Equipment Posts Gains

With cost-conscious hospitals tightening their belts even more and
integrated systems eliminating equipment redundancies, imaging
equipment remanufacturers keep picking up steam. Companies like
Comdisco, Inc., Rosemont, Ill., Refurbco, Grand Rapids, Mich.,
and Picker's PTS (Picker Technical Services) Division appear to be
finding more acceptance than ever.

Price is becoming more critical too, particularly as the responsibility
for big ticket purchasing decisions radiologists share with
administrators who are beginning to regard imaging equipment as
commodities. Hospitals are just now beginning to consider life cycle
costs over five-year periods when making purchasing decisions.

Editor's note: Special thanks to Dave Natale, director of technical
assessment for SunHealth Alliance, Charlotte, N.C.; John Sutton,
contract manager for AmeriNet, St. Louis; and Derwood Dunbar,
Jr., president and CEO of MAGNET, Harrisburg, Pa., for their

OUTCOMES ANALYSIS CAN WIN OVER TOUGH
AUDIENCES

By Michael T. Kelly
The medical device industry isn't usually thought of as a high-
fashion business. It's a long way from orthopedic implants and
intra-aortic balloons to Bill Blass and Calvin Klein. Even so, the
medical device industry has its own "fashions"--trends that gather
momentum and buzzwords that hang in the air. And the trend of the
moment is "outcomes."

There's good reason for this, of course. The rise of outcomes
analysis is the product of two interwoven revolutions under way in
the health care industry. The first is the emphasis on cost and
performance. The second comes from advances in information
technology. As we become more adept at digital manipulation, our
understanding of the health care landscape becomes sharper and
more sophisticated. And it is here that cost and performance
concerns intersect with data-gathering ability. The development of
information-based health care delivery allows opportunities to be
pinpointed with greater precision than ever before. To think in terms
of outcomes--of the cost and success rate of a complete course of
therapy rather than the price of its individual components--is a
natural extension of this point of view.

So it is that the health care vendor today finds himself or herself in a
transitional environment that requires skillful navigation. For while
there may be agreement in theory regarding the benefits of an
outcomes approach, as with so many things the actual practice lags
behind. "It's very easy for a purchasing agent to look at a 10%
discount and grasp immediately what he is getting," Joseph
Laptewicz, president and CEO of Empi, a manufacturer of
neurological and urological devices, told me recently. "Selling him
on a new therapy that represents up-front expense but a 30% to 40%
reduction in total therapeutic cost is more difficult."

That there should be resistance in the face of such a payoff is a
frustrating predicament, but not without its reasons. A large part of
the problem is rooted in the fact that it is much more difficult to sell a
new therapy than a new product. It involves not just making space
on the stockroom shelves, but changes in the treatment protocol--the
"operating manual" that lies at the heart of the customer's business.
Prescribing a pain management device means more than incurring
the $500 cost of the product--it means asking physicians to adopt a
more time-and labor-intensive approach than writing the traditional
prescription for narcotic medication. Calling for such a fundamental
shift is a tall order--and one that requires winning over people at all
levels within the network, from M.D.s and R.N.s to plan
administrators and medical directors--each of whom has a natural
loyalty to "tried and true" methods. "It's easiest not to change,"
explains Laptewicz. "And at times it seems like there are a thousand
people who can say no, and no one who can say yes."

The key to convincing such a tough audience lies in taking their
"show me" attitude and turning it to your advantage. Empi solved
that problem by developing a limited outcomes trial that providers
can conduct at one of their sites. "It's easier to convince an HMO to
try our incontinence devices at one of their locations than to change
over the entire network at once," says Laptewicz. "After the
providers see cost and performance data on a group of 30 of their
own patients over a six-month period, they are much more receptive
to our message."

Indeed, while the emphasis on outcomes may be the result of new
thinking, today's vendor will do well to be guided by the old and
reliable standard of customer needs. For if hospitals are beginning to
judge by outcomes, so too are they being judged--by payers and
patients. Customer education also plays a key role, as sophistication
on this issue will vary greatly from account to account. There is no
uniform measurement for outcomes, after all, and as the health care
industry gropes toward standards for various indications, there is an
opportunity for the device maker to contribute its expertise to the
dialogue. "An institution may want to claim that it can wean patients
off ventilators within a certain period of time. We need to give them
support to help them make that claim," says Jim Hickey, president
and CEO of Aequitron Medical, whose products include sleep apnea
equipment and infant monitors. Doing so means designing devices
that provide the raw information that makes such a statement
possible. For while there will always be debate on how to define an
outcome, you can't even begin the discussion unless you have the
data. Thus, customers are placing a greater premium on remote
monitoring and recording functions. Hickey lists two things he
wants his sales force to be able to offer: a positive outcome at a
competitive cost, and the data to support those cost and performance
claims. As medical software houses develop increasingly complex
clinical decision support systems, the value of such data will only
increase.

Ultimately, the focus on outcomes is part of a larger matrix of
factors controlling health care purchasing, including patient
compliance, cost and quality of life. But as Aequitron's Jim Hickey
points out, these are just a modified version of the factors that we
already use when buying something for ourselves. "If you are
thinking about buying a car, for example, you ask four things:
'How much will I use it? How much does it cost? How well does it
work? and How much will it improve my quality of life?' It's
becoming the same with buying a medical device."

Michael T. Kelly, a former vice president at St. Paul, Minn.-based
St. Jude Medical, is a managing director of Russell Reynolds
Associates, a global executive recruiting firm.

OWENS, HENRY SCHEIN MARKETING TANDEM CREATES
"VIRTUAL ORGANIZATION"

Owens & Minor, Inc., and physicians' office supplier Henry
Schein, Inc., Melville, N.Y., have signed a multi-year joint
marketing agreement designed to broaden the product offerings of
both companies. The "virtual organization" formed by the pact,
known as Net/GAIN(TM), will give Richmond, Va.-based Owens
access to the physicians' office market for the first time and help
Henry Schein gain entry to new business through integrated delivery
systems across the country. To compensate Owens & Minor for its
efforts in bringing in new business, Henry Schein will pay an
unspecified fee to Owens based on a percentage of sales.

The arrangement is scheduled to be launched this month. Henry
Schein executives will address the Owens & Minor sales force on
the Net/GAIN project at the end of the month at a national sales
meeting.

Owens will inject its sales and marketing expertise, in particular its
proficiency in the areas of rebates and chargebacks, into the virtual
organization. Henry Schein brings access to its more than 200,000
physician customers, many of them in the dental segment, which
will allow the Net/GAIN organization to offer a range of services to
integrated delivery systems. Through the venture, Net/GAIN will
offer a "one-stop shop" to physicians, including pharmaceuticals,
office supplies and diagnostic products. The combination will also
boost the purchasing power of both companies.

Henry Schein will handle the logistics for Net/GAIN customers--
taking orders and completing shipments--and be responsible for
direct marketing and enrollment of individual practitioners in the
program. The company has about 200 sales reps, all of whom work
over the telephone, along with 50 direct field reps, with plans to
double that to 100 over time.

The 60-year-old company, which went public in early November,
operates distribution centers in Port Washington, N.Y., Indianapolis
and Reno, Nev., plus five more overseas. The company says that
37% of its customers receive one-day shipping service, while 88%
receive their shipments in two days, all through common carriers.
Due to the small nature of the vast majority of Henry Schein
shipments to doctors (mostly under $200 each), the company has
few back orders and boasts a 99%-plus fill rate.

That remarkable fill rate is reached through use of a supply
formulary approach that has worked to reduce both the number of
vendors with which it works and the number of SKUs it offers. For
example, Owens & Minor carries approximately 320,000 SKUs
while Henry Schein lists only about 90,000.

In early December, Net/GAIN signed up its first customer. The
program will provide medical-surgical supplies, laboratory,
imaging, diagnostic, health and beauty aids and office products to
physicians affiliated with the Montgomery General Hospital System,
Olney, Md. The agreement includes service to 229-bed Montgomery
General Hospital. Other pilot Net/GAIN programs are in place as
well.

BAXTER'S NEW SUPPLY CHAIN PLAN WORRIES SOME
VENDORS

A program instituted by Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, Ill.,
designed to cut its costs and raise service levels for its hospital
customers has become a worry for a few medical-surgical supply
manufacturers. In September, Baxter's rationalized supply chain
program began to place slower moving items into the company's
new national drop-ship center in Chicago in a strategy that affects
both Baxter-made and non-Baxter-made supplies. The company
says that about 5% of its lines have been relocated to that Chicago
center.

The new stocking system is based on the number of times a line item
product is picked. Items that are picked more than 300 times a year
will remain stocked locally at one of the company's distribution
centers. Items that are picked between 80 and 300 times have been
moved to the Chicago drop-ship center. Items that are picked fewer
than 80 times will be drop-shipped from the manufacturer,
according to Baxter's plan, which is aimed at improving efficiency
and reducing dead inventory.

Despite all this, at least one vendor told Health Industry Today that
as a partner with Baxter, it feels that Baxter should maintain its local
stocking of all items. "We want our products stocked locally if
they're going to be a distributor for us," said the supplier, who
asked to remain anonymous. The vendor said he feels Baxter's new
system will serve to slow the distribution chain. On the other hand,
Baxter is convinced that its plan will improve fill rates, fill times and
predictability.

KENTUCKY DISTRIBUTORS TO MERGE

An upcoming merger of two Kentucky-based medical-surgical
supply distributors was done, at least in part, to counter the trend of
acquisitions of med-surg distributors by publicly owned national
companies. Independent suppliers Ransdell Surgical, Inc.,
Louisville, Ky., and Grogan's Healthcare Supply Inc., Lexington,
Ky., announced plans to merge last month and said that avoiding
such an acquisition and maintaining local control was a "specific
objective" of their plans. The merger is expected to be completed
sometime in mid-1996.

The companies hope that such local control will protect jobs and
keep tax revenue at the local level.

The unnamed merged company will hold a dominant position in
each of the markets it serves, with more than 15,000 customers
throughout Kentucky and southern Indiana. Ransdell focuses on the
hospital market, especially in Louisville, Lexington, western
Kentucky and southern Indiana. Grogan's concentrates on
expansion into new product areas in non-hospital segments,
particularly in central and eastern Kentucky. The new company will
carry approximately 20,000 products from more than 1,500
manufacturers. It sells, rents and services these items for hospitals,
sub-acute nursing facilities, surgery centers, clinics and other
alternate site providers.

Ransdell also has two sister companies: Choice Medical, Inc., and
Medical Business Associates, which provides technologies and
management information to providers.

SHOW BIZ . . .

One From The Heart

HIT couldn't make the recent American Heart Assn. annual meeting,
but a report from New York analysts C.J. Lawrence Inc. summed
up the proceedings. "One adjective that comes to mind to describe
the exhibit floor is . . . jammed," wrote C.J.'s Jill Topkis Weiss.
"Although a wave of consolidation has been sweeping through the
medical device industry, the number of vendors populating the
exhibit floor appears to have increased. The explanation for this
peculiarity may lie in heightened responsiveness from our nearest
and dearest friend, the FDA. We believe that the recent wealth of
new product approvals is responsible for the crop of new vendors at
this year's event." What was hot: continued focus on minimally
invasive products, potential therapies for atrial fibrillation and stent
studies galore.

Virtuality

Varian Associates has come up with a way to put all of its customers
and potential customers right down in the front row to see its latest
products. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based manufacturer set up a
"virtual" trade show "booth" that allows customers to see its
products from their desktops. The company believes that the virtual
booth, located inside of Varian Oncology Systems' Web Site (which
can be accessed at Varian's URL, http://www.varian.com.) is most
helpful for customers who cannot attend trade shows.

Role Playing

NCI will host a conference in Phoenix, Feb. 4-6, entitled
"Orchestrating New Roles: Group Strategies for the Health Care
Evolution." Senior executives from major GPOs and chains will
lead the discussions.

Call 714-589-6500.

PRODUCER PRICE INDEX INCHES 0.1% HIGHER IN
NOVEMBER; MEDICAL CARE COMMODITIES INCREASE BY
0.3%

Analysis:
The finished goods component of the Producer Price Index inched
higher by 0.1% in November, putting it at 128.6. This index, which
tracks wholesale level prices, stands at its highest point since 1982,
and is 2.0% higher than its November 1994 level.

Only two of the 16 selected categories tracked in this month's PPI
report registered price increases, led by surgical instruments,
including suture needles, prices of which rose by 0.6%. Five
categories decreased, led by catheter prices, which dropped by
2.5%. Eight categories went unchanged for the month.

November's unadjusted urban Consumer Price Index (for all
consumer items) slipped 0.1% to 153.6. Over the past 12 months,
this index is up 2.6%.

Medical Care Commodities rose 0.3% to 206.3 in November. Over
the past 12 months, this index is up 1.8%.

For most data, 100 equals the price level in 1982. For ophthalmic
goods and surgical implants, the base year is 1983. Drugs are based
in 1984. The medical X-ray index base is 1990. Figures are not
seasonally adjusted.

PURCHASING MANAGERS: MANUFACTURING SLOWS
FOR FOURTH STRAIGHT MONTH

In November, for the fourth consecutive month, economic activity
slowed in the manufacturing sector, and at a slightly faster rate of
decline than in October, according to the most recent report from the
National Assn. of Purchasing Management. While this was
happening, the overall economy continued to grow, but at a slower
rate of growth than in the previous month.

The NAPM Purchasing Managers' Index decreased a bit in
November to 46.5%, compared with 46.8% in October. The NAPM
Production Index dropped to 45.8%, the lowest reading since June
1995 (44.8%). Both New Orders and Backlog of Orders indexes
have reversed direction each month for the past five months. The
New Orders Index for November rose to 50.1%, while the Backlog
of Orders Index increased to 41.5%.

The Supplier Deliveries Index for November recorded its fourth
straight month of faster delivery times, with a reading of 45.8%, the
speediest delivery indication since April 1991 (45.0%). The
Inventories Index increased to 43.2%, possibly indicating that
inventory reduction activity may have passed its peak. Half of the
purchasers polled said their own materials and supplies levels were
about right, but 44% said the levels were too high. Of the 20
manufacturing industries tracked, just four reported November
improvement, compared with eight improving in October over
September.

Purchasing Managers' Index (over 50% indicates that manufacturing
economy is generally expanding)

November '95: 46.5%
October '95: 46.8%
November '94: 59.9%
