Mr. Carl E. Olsen <br>
Iowans For Medical Marijuana <br>
P.O. Box 4091 <br>
Des Moines, Iowa 50333 </p>

<p>Dear Carl: </p>

<p>Thank you for writing to support the Medical Marijuana
Rescheduling Bill (H.R. 2618) as well as for the information you
sent me.&nbsp; I welcome this opportunity to respond. </p>

<p>You may be interested to learn that Representative Frank of
Massachusetts introduced H.R. 2618 on November 10, 1995.&nbsp;
Marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug which
means that it has a high potential for abuse and is not permitted
for medical use.&nbsp; H.R. 2618 would reschedule marijuana as a
Schedule II drug and allow doctors to prescribe marijuana for
medical purposes such as treating glaucoma.&nbsp; The bill would
also establish the Office for the Supply of Internationally
Controlled Drugs which would regulate and supervise the
production of marijuana for medicinal purposes.&nbsp; H.R. 2618
was referred to the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health
and Environment and the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on
Crime.&nbsp; No further action has been taken on the bill at this
time. </p>

<p>I understand that marijuana does have some medical uses.&nbsp;
However, as you may know, the National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse has reported the number of adolescents aged 12-17 using
marijuana and other drugs has increased from 5.3% in 1992 to
19.9% in 1995.&nbsp; I am concerned that legalizing drugs for
medical purposes could increase the supply of marijuana available
to drug abusers and cause a further lapse in the progress that
has been made so far in fighting the war on drugs.&nbsp; </p>

<p>While we may not completely agree on this issue, please do not
hesitate to contact me in the future if you have questions or
concerns you would like to express.&nbsp; Again, thanks for
writing. </p>
