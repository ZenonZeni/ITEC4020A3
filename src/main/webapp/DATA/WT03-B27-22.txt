<h3>
<center>WELCOME FROM JONATHAN NICHOLAS<br>
PRESIDENT OF CYCLE OREGON</center>
<h4>
<p>
The man the world came to know as Chief Joseph, leader in the nineteenth century of the people called the Nez Perce by the wandering French trappers, was a remarkable individual. He led his nomadic people in a life lived in rhythmic harmony with a landscape as wild, as rugged and as breathtaking as any on our planet.
<p>
When he first came into contact with what Indians called the "endless village" of whites, Joseph urged upon his people a simple admonition: "Be brave and always tell the truth."
<p>
Truth be told, few of the first U.S. government representatives to enter the Wallowa Valley were big on either valor or veracity.
<p>
Little of the Nez Perce presence remains in this area today. But their spirit, and their legacy, haunts this spellbinding swath of canyon and rimrock, of snow and desert, of prairie and streams that sing.
<p>
I'm delighted you have decided to join us on a remarkable bicycle ride, a journey through the heart of the American West. The country you are about to encounter is vast with promise, redolent with myth and memory, teasing yet with its potential as the native home of hope. As Oregon moves beyond boom-and-bust cycles, it may yet find here in its Northeastern corner a sustainable economy, what Oregonian historian Terence O'Donnell calls "that balance so rare."
<P>
Please treat this land, and the people who carve a living from its bounty, with respect as they welcome us to the place we call wonderful, the place they call home.
<P>

<b>THE LOGISTICS</b>
<P>
OK, now that the statistics are out of the way, I can tell you a little something about the trip.  1995 was the eighth year that Cycle Oregon took place, and it was the third year that I participated in the event.  The ride is fully subscribed within a week of the applications being sent out, and each year the ride traverses a different route.  This year 
we cycled through rural northeastern Oregon.  Most of the towns that we cycled through or camped at have a population of less that 500 people.  The trip traversed through the former home terrain of Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce Indians, former gold mining areas, the Oregon emigrant trail, hay fields and hills, hills, and more hills!
<p>
An amazing thing about Cycle Oregon is how smoothly everything works.  The logistics are impressive when you consider that there are 2,200 cyclists on the road, a couple of hundred support people, and many support vehicles. 
<P>
In addition, the riders were provided with three meals a day.  For example, here is the quantity of food supplied for lunch on the 4th day of the trip: 625 lbs. of turkey, (yes, vegetarians had non-meat meals) 266 loaves of bread, 300 lbs. of cheese, 1,632 cans of soft drinks, 34 cases of Gatoraide, 2,000 lbs. of salad, 147 lbs. of bean sprouts, 44 
flats of grapes, etc., etc. 
<P>
Camp sites are provided every evening. If you have never seen 1,500 tents set up on a high school football field, believe me it is a sight to see!  Every evening portable showers are also set up and they never run out of hot water. Of course there is also a myriad of porta-potties.  
<P>
The ride also has four ambulances riding on the course, four Oregon State Motorcycle Troopers tooling along on the road plus five sag wagons. In addition, three different traveling bicycle repair shops set up free repair facilities every day, and 20-30 masseuses provided massages for a fee.  For those who were thirsty, Full Sail Brewery, out of Hood River, set up a beer garden every evening.  
<P>
The ride is great to participate in just to see how this moving wheeled community flawlessly works.
<P>
<b>THE DAILY JOURNAL</b>
<P>
DAY ONE:<br>
Well, the first day we cycled from Athena (Elevation 1,734 ), located just north of Pendleton, to Elgin (Elevation 2,692).  The ride was only about 45 miles in length; we had to climb one big hill (Peak Elevation 5,160).  Lunch was at Spout Springs Ski Area (Elevation 5,028).  Elgin is a community with the Wallowa Mountains to the east and the Blue Mountains to the west.  Elgin's site was once the location of the Central Indian Camp of the Nez Perce tribe, and a trading area since the 1880s.  Total climb: 4,150ft.
<P>
DAY TWO:<br>
On day two we entered the beautiful Wallowa Valley, and had lunch in Wallowa.  We cycled 54 miles and climbed 3,280ft.  Camp was at Joseph (Elevation 4,247), a thriving art community located on the edge of the Eagle Cap Wilderness.
<P>
DAY THREE:<br>
This was a tough day.  The distance was 78 miles, and the total climb was 5,290ft.  We had lunch overlooking Hells Canyon National Recreation Area.  Hells Canyon is the deepest river gorge in North America, and a beautiful sight to see.  After a sweet 17 mile decent into the Pine Valley, we camped at Halfway (Elevation 2,684), the home 
of Inga Thompson, former Olympic cycling medalist.
<P>
DAY FOUR:<br>
We cycled 84 miles and climbed 4,800ft.  Lunch was just outside Baker City at the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center.  This is a special place to visit.  They have wonderful life size displays of the pioneers traversing the Oregon Trail in the 1850s.  You can still see the wagon wheel ruts in the high desert.  Ah yes, the high desert.  We cycled about 50 miles of desert today.  It was hot, it was sunny and it was hard.  About 50 riders sagged into the evening camp at Sumpter (Elevation 4,463).  Sumpter, population 150, was a booming gold mining community and as recently as 1957 their gold dredge was still operating.  The dredge can still be viewed on the edge of town.
<P>
DAY FIVE:<br>
This day was only 46 miles, and the climbing was 3,280ft.  We had lunch in Unity (Elevation 5,124), where we were treated to some wonderful foot-stomping, hand-clapping, fiddling music.  We descended into Prairie City (Elevation 3,553), and saw to the west the beautiful backdrop of the Strawberry Mountains.
<P>
DAY SIX:<br>
On this day we had a 72-mile ride and climbed 3,800 ft.  During the many mining booms that hit Eastern Oregon, thousands of Chinese laborers were employed.  John Day the first community we traveled through, is the site of the Kam Wah Museum, which celebrates the herbal medicine practice of the Chinese mine workers.  Lunch was served at Fox (Elevation 4,387). After a few more hot and steep climbs, we dropped 10 fast miles into Monument (Elevation 2,013).  Monument is an agricultural town bustling with activity in September.  Hay, mint, apples and pears all come to harvest during September.
<P>
DAY SEVEN:<br>
Whew, the last day.  On one hand you¹re pleased that the ride is finishing, but there is sadness knowing that the special magical event is almost over.  We cycled 60 miles today and climbed 2,690ft.  We had 40 miles of gentle downhill, and then a 2,100ft climb in ten miles.  Then we dropped down to Fossil (Elevation 2,656), and finished the 
ride!
<P>
<b>ODDS & ENDS</b>
<P>
<li>Yes, there were a few accidents on the ride, such as dislocated  shoulders, fractured collar bones and road rash.  However, the problems were small considering the number of cyclists on the road.
<P>
<LI>A question frequently asked is ³do you feel overwhelmed by all the people on the ride.²   The answer is yes and no.  While you are cycling along you are usually never out of sight of another cyclist, however you never feel hemmed in by other riders.  The cyclists start riding at about 6 a.m. ( yes, it is still dark ), and continue getting on the road up to about 10 a.m. Thus, there is a line of cyclists stretching 40 miles down the road!
<P>
<LI>Camping is an interesting experience. The number of riders and a finite amount of camping space require the tents to be set up close to one another.  So, if by chance, you happen to set up your tent next to a person whom snores, well, I surely hope you have ear plugs!
<P>
<LI>Usually there are lines to use the showers and porta-potties.  All lines move quickly, and you can always strike up an interesting conversation with the bikies next to you.
<P>
<li>Although I don¹t have statistics, My eyes lead me to believe that the average age of the cyclists was between 40-50 years.
<P>
<LI>Most cyclists rode road bikes, but there were many mountain bikes, tandems, recumbents and folding bikes.
<P>
<li>The cyclists rode unencumbered.  The ride provided six tractor trailer trucks to cart the cyclist¹s gear from one campsite to another.
<P>
There it is, It was another great Cycle Oregon ride and maybe I¹ll see you there next year!  If you¹re interested in finding out more about Cycle Oregon, call 1 800-CYCLEOR or <a href="mailto:cycleor@mmgco.com">e-mail</a> and they will put you on the mailing list for Cycle Oregon IX.
