<P>
This work investigates new hydrogen storage options that could be 
significant 
improvements over currently available technologies.  The current focus is 
on hydrogen 
adsorption in the recently discovered family of materials known as carbon 
nanotubes.  These 
tiny tube-like configurations made of carbon have large surface areas in 
comparison to their 
volume, which allows more hydrogen to adsorb onto the structure.  They 
also pack together 
easily for more efficient hydrogen storage and transport.  In previous 
studies, the properties of carbon storage materials (e.g., surface area, 
pore size and distribution, micropore volume, heat of adsorption) were 
measured but not controlled.  A key goal of this work is to identify the 
optimal dimensions and other properties at which the carbon nanotubes 
adsorb the most 
hydrogen and then synthesize the nanotubes in large amounts at low cost.

<b><I>Recent Advances:</I></b>
<P>We performed a detailed analysis by atomic force microscopy and

transmission electron  microscopy to assess the amount of single-wall

carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in the arc-generated soots produced in

our lab.  In essence, SWNTs were found at a 0.05 wt  % level 

in arc-generated soots.  This result allowed us to determine the

amount of hydrogen stored in the 285 K temperature-programmed

desorption peak observed for SWNT materials to be ~ 10 wt % on

an SWNT weight basis.  The SWNT materials will become a viable

hydrogen storage technology only if they can be fabricated in

high yields cost effectively.  The demonstration on 50% conversion

of evaporated carbon into SWNTs at Rice University is an encouraging

sign that high-yield, cost-effective production may be possible.

 We have begun to evaluate the performance of Rice's samples in

hydrogen storage.
<P>
We performed experiments at NREL's High-Flux Solar Furnace designed

to explore the feasibility of producing SWNTs with concentrated

sunlight.  We developed two new methods for fabricating Co-doped

carbon targets for use in these experiments.  The first method

involved vapor transport of Co<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub> 

into degassed graphite powder, followed by subsequent heating to 

510&#176;C in vacuum to drive the thermal decomposition of

Co<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub>.  The second method employed

refluxing a mixture of Co<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub>, toluene, 

and graphite powder to produce Co<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub>-doped 

graphite.  The solvent was then stripped, and the 
Co<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>8</sub>

was thermally decomposed under vacuum.  Transmission

electron microscopy did not indicate the presence of cobalt 
nanoparticles

in either of the powders.  However, electron probe microanalysis

performed on pellets pressed from the powders at 12,500 psi indicated

Co contents of 0.83 and 0.39 at % with the refluxing and vapor

transport methods, respectively.  These results indicate that

cobalt that had been introduced by the doping methods was in a

highly divided form with particle sizes less 1 nm.

<P>

The targets were mounted on a graphite block and positioned in

a reactor designed for C<sub>60</sub> production.  The reaction chamber 
was

evacuated and purged several times with argon before each run.

 A 3 L/min Ar flow rate was established to keep the concentrating

optics free of carbon and avoid overheating of the reactor.  The

samples were exposed to solar fluxes of ~ 14 kSuns for 7 minutes

total.  Fibrous webbing formed inside the reactor in each of the

runs.  Transmission electron microscopy revealed the webbing consisted

of bundles of SWNTs that were 10-20 SWNTs across.  Spongy deposits

on the graphite support block were found to contain SWNTs.  Soot

deposited in the bottom of the reactor also contained SWNTs in

very low yield.  We believe the SWNT yield is limited by the lack

of a suitable annealing zone for the carbon fragments produced

by the solar beam.  Rapid quenching of the carbon vapor caused

by the required argon flow and a small hot zone preclude the formation

of equilibrium structures like SWNTs.  A next-generation reactor

will address these issues; the goal is to generate SWNTs in high

yield in a cost-effective manner.
