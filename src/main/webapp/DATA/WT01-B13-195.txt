<H3>ZURICH INSURANCE GROUP COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF KEMPER CORPORATION
</H3>

CHICAGO (January 4, 1996) - Zurich Insurance Group and Insurance
Partners today announced the completion of the acquisition of Kemper
Corporation (NYSE: KEM) of Long Grove, IL, in a merger transaction
valued at more than $2 billion. Kemper common stockholders will receive
cash consideration of $49.80 per share in the merger.
<P>

All approvals and transactions required by the merger agreement,
including the spin-off of Kemper's securities brokerage operations and
sales of a considerable part of its real estate holdings, were
completed. As of the closing, Kemper Corporation will consist of Federal
Kemper Life Assurance Company, Kemper Investors Life Insurance Company
and certain real estate subsidiaries. Subsequent to the closing, the two
life insurance companies will operate under the trade name "Zurich
Kemper Life Insurance Companies." Zurich Insurance Group will own 80
percent of Kemper Corporation and Insurance Partners will own 20
percent.
<P>

As part of the transaction, Zurich Insurance Group acquired Kemper
Financial Services, Inc. (KFS). Following the merger, KFS is to be
renamed "Zurich Kemper Investments, Inc." It is anticipated that Zurich
Kemper Investments will become the flagship operation for the Zurich's
U.S.-based investment fund and institutional asset management
activities. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company will own 3 percent of
Zurich Kemper Investments.
<P>

Rolf H&uuml;ppi, chairman and chief executive officer of The Zurich Insurance
Group said, "The completion of this transaction marks a significant step
toward implementing our financial services strategy. With the
acquisition, Zurich will be able to move closer to our goal of deriving
30 percent of our total revenues from life insurance operations and
build a solid foundation for its worldwide asset management business."
Mr. H&uuml;ppi continued, "We appreciate the efforts of the management and
staff of Kemper over the past months during this transition period."
<P>

Kemper Corporation, a financial services holding company with principal
operations in asset management and life insurance, had approximately $98
billion in life insurance premiums in force; KFS ranked as the nation's
13th largest mutual fund family with $42 billion in mutual fund assets
under management and managed $21 billion in institutional assets.
<P>

providing services in life and non-life insurance, reinsurance and asset
management. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, the Group operates

coverage in all lines of insurance. Zurich had worldwide premium
writings of approximately $19.3 billion in 1994 and over $7.3 billion in
capital and surplus at year-end 1994.
<P>
