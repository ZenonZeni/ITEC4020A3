"There are so many views of Eva Peron, I think it's impossible to make a film that will please everyone," admits Evita director Allen Parker.  "On the other hand, it's a very emotional film about a woman who came from nowhere, who clearly did a great deal of good and ended up dying very young."<P>

To say that this British filmmaker has undertaken an enormous task bringing the musical Evita to the big screen is something of an understatement. Ever since Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim
 Rice wrote the music for Evita back in the mid-'70s, turning it into one of the most popular stage musicals of all time, the bittersweet story of Eva Peron has entered into international popular culture. The music is so familiar to most people that even Madonna, whom Alan Parker chose to play the Argentinian icon, refers to Don t Cry For MeArgentina as "the song".<P>

In over 80 days of shooting from Buenos Aires to Budapest and
Shepperton Studios near London, Alan Parker has created a lavish $60-million dollar film musical which does something that has rarely been tried in a feature-length film - Evita tells most
of the story through music alone. Alan wrote the screenplay based on the1976 album Evita rather than the subsequent stage musical, and this bold experiment relies almost exclusively on the power of the songs to tell the story. And what a story it is.<P>

Maria Eva Duarte was born in 1919, the illegitimate daughter of a poor farmer from the small Argentine town of Junin. Fleeing to the bright lights of Buenos Aires as a teenager, Eva had hopes of stardom but had little going for her other than her lovely looks and a
determined spirit. In the late 1930s the ambitious blonde managed to become a minor radio and film actress and made her all-important break into Buenos Aires high society. She became the mistress of a rising young politician named Juan Peron and then became his second wife. When Juan Peron was elected President of Argentina in 1946, on a populist bandwagon, Eva became the nation's First Lady. While the President was a political icon in the eyes of organised labour and the masses, Eva became a social icon. Known as Evita to her admirers, she was akin to a Princess Diana but with
political clout. Idolised for her beauty and her displays of sympathy for the plight of ordinary Argentines, her popularity almost eclipsed her husband's. Some even suggested she should run for
vice-president. But, in 1952, at the height of her husband's power, she was stricken with cancer and died aged 33.<P>

It is the elements of triumph and despair in Evita's life story which
attracted Alan Parker (Mississippi Burning, The Commitments) to make the film version. The film had been attempted several times before (Oliver Stone was linked to the project) without getting off the ground.<P>

From the outset, Alan knew the project would require plenty of ingenuity to be successful. The musical score was recorded before shooting the film, the recording taking place in a London sound studio over four months in late 1995. Alan played around with some of the original lyrics and arrangements and a new song, You Must Love Me, was included.<P>

Normally, in screen musicals, the recording of the songs is done after shooting the film. In Evita, most of what was filmed over the 84 days of shooting on location, early in 1996, had to be lip-synched to the studio recorded score. Although Madonna already knew all about the intricacies of lip-synching, the same didn't apply to the two other principal leads, Jonathan Pryce (playing Juan Peron) and Antonio Banderas (as Che Guevara).<P>

Added to this was initial resistance to the film being shot in Argentina, from locals who still revere Peron. When the cast and crew arrived in Buenos Aires, they found graffiti painted on walls by Peronist diehards declaring, "Evita Lives! Madonna Get Out!". Even President Carlos Menem, a Peronist, initially declared himself opposed to the project as a "libellous interpretation of Evita's life". Both Alan Parker and Madonna had to work hard to swing his opinion around to their side. Eventually he let them film a scene from the balcony of the Presidential Palace where Evita used to address adoring crowds. In the film, Madonna sings the pivotal Don't Cry For Me Argentina from the balcony, an experience she says physically moved her.<P>

"In the exact place she had stood so many times before, I felt her enter my body like a heat missile. Starting at my feet, travelling up my spine and flying out of my fingertips into the air and back up to
Heaven. Afterwards, I was so happy but I felt a great sadness too because she is haunting me. She is pushing me to feel things."<P>

A major hurdle which faced the project was the sudden discovery, during filming, that Madonna was pregnant. Careful use of coats and accessories, as well as judicious camera angles, obscured the singer's rapidly growing stomach as shooting progressed. In October, Madonna gave birth to a baby girl christened Lourdes Maria. an event which temporarily eclipsed the international attention the film
had attracted.<P>

Aside from the pregnancy, having to shoot Evita to already recorded music made a difficult project even harder, admits Madonna. <P>

"When we were recording the music, we would act out the scenes repeatedly before Alan would settle on the take he liked most, the one he visualised shooting. When we couldn't decide, we would record several different versions, as if we were doing an acting take on a film," explains the star in an interview in the Sunday Telegraph.<P>

"I must say I dreaded singing Don t Cry For Me Argentina. I had to
sing it on the very first day we were in the recording studio, the first time in front of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber. I was practically in tears."<P>

The 38-year-old singer and actress has invested a good deal of her
credibility in the project, especially as far as film acting goes. In her screen roles to date, she s only had one performance that was well received - and that was largely playing up her own early vamp image in Desperately Seeking Susan.<P>

As soon as Madonna heard that Alan Parker was making Evita, she
apparently wrote a long letter to him outlining why she'd be perfect for the role. Early consideration centred on Michelle Pfeiffer playing the lead. Alan says once they got into a discussion he quickly realised
that Madonna would be right for the role and wouldn't hold back in
her performance. "She promised me from the very beginning she would give her all and she has kept her promise."<P>

There are many parallels in the lives of Madonna and Eva Peron.
Both women are a bundle of contradictions. Both rose from obscurity to enormous fame and used the power of images to transform themselves. Both learned that if they changed their presentation of
themselves, they changed people's perceptions of who they really are. And both have expressed strong feelings of being misunderstood
by many people.<P>

Madonna appreciates that Evita faced many of the same reactions
she has endured. Evita was condemned by her opponents as being
manipulative and scheming.<P>

"It's not a bad thing to want to control the things that are happening
to you," says Madonna. "Look at any great actor - when they reinvent
themselves, it's considered art. When I do it, it's looked on as evil and manipulative. A lot of people are jealous of anyone doing well. I think the real Evita was desperate and misunderstood. She was a generous person hurt by life. It sounds familiar to me.<P>

"Why am I hurt by life? I think losing my mother at a very young age was a devastating experience. I'm sure that has affected every decision I've made.  You have a hunger, a lonely feeling of emptiness. You sort of grow up thinking people are going to leave you and maybe that's why I tend to overreact to things."<P>

Alan Parker sees other similarities between his star and the woman she portrays in Evlta.<P>

"The thing about Madonna is she's so well known," he explains. "She's an icon and people have views about her, for and against. Rather similar to the way people had very different views on Eva Peron."<P>
In an interview with American magazine Vanity Fair, Madonna admits that, in the end, she couldn't answer a lot of the questions about the woman Evita but she did grow to love the character she played for five gruelling months.<P>

"Have I solved the riddle of Evita? Have I answered all the burning questions? Why was her country so passionately divided for and against her? Why did she provoke such a strong response in people, then and now? Was she good or bad? Innocent or manipulative? I'm still not sure but I know one thing. I have grown to love her."<P>

During filming, the singer and actress admits there were moments when she felt at one with the dying character she was playing.<P>

"I dreamed of Evita; I was not outside watching her, I was her. I felt her sadness and restlessness. I felt hungry and unsatisfied. She wanted her life to matter. She didn't have time for the bureaucracies of government. She needed results. <P>

"The idea of death is not so horrible if one can leave behind a legacy and Eva did not want to be remembered as a girl from the sticks or a B-actress or the wife of a president. She wanted to be remembered for her goodness. The desire of someone who has lived her life completely misunderstood." <P>

Madonna has endured so many false starts in her desire to be recognised as a good actress that much of her future before the cameras hangs on the success of Evita. That's why the singer is hopeful the musical format has put the odds in her favour.<P>

"I don't think I'm a bad actress, I just think I've been in some bad movies. It has put pressure on my performance in Evita. The good thing is it's a musical, so l hope people will be more accepting
of me in the role because so much of it is about music." <P>
