 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ABSORPTION </H2>

<P>   SUSTENASE is designed to help us digest our foods naturally and properly so we can absorb the nutrients we eat.   It helps to maintain a healthy digestive tract by reducing the amount of undigested foodstuffs remaining and to maintain healthy pHs throughout the digestive tract.    It also  supplies  a representative  amount of beneficial micro-flora also supporting bowel ecology. It has been said that "we are what we eat." That is only partially true.  We are made of what we eat, digest, absorb and assimilate into our bodies.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> DIGESTION OF FOODS</H2>
 <P>  Digestion starts in the mouth with chewing the foods we eat. In the saliva is an enzyme, Ptylin, that begins to break down starches into more simple sugars.</P>
<P>   When food is swallowed, the stomach takes over by secreting Hydrochloric Acid and the enzyme, Pepsin. Hydrochloric Acid further digests the starches and begins protein digestion.</P>
<P>   In about 30 minutes the food leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine, where it is exposed to more digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreas.   They consist of (l) Proteases to digest proteins, (2) Amylases to digest starches, and (3) Lipases to digest fats.   In addition to these, the gall bladder secretes bile for the emulsification and digestion of fats.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> INDIGESTION</H2>
 <P>   If the body is healthy and working properly, it should produce all of these enzymes in sufficient quantities to ensure proper digestion. However, many people do not produce enough of these enzymes. As a result, they often get the common symptoms of indigestion, such as gas, bloating, heartburn and constipation.  Unfortunately, thousands of people take antacids because they have seen the ads on TV that convince them they have too much stomach acid when, in most cases, the reverse is actually true.</P>
 <P>  Antacids actually slow down or even stop the digestive process and give only temporary relief. Antacids only postpone the long term problems that arise from improper digestion.  It is much more rational to supplement the body with natural enzymes to ensure that the digestive tract can digest the food properly.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TWO PHASES</H2>
<P>   SUSTENASE is a two-phase digestive supplement formulated in a unique manner so that it releases certain enzymes and buffering agents in the stomach and others in the small intestine.</P>
<P>   To provide supplemental acid in the stomach, SUSTENASE releases Betaine HCl and Glutamic Acid HCl.  In addition, SUSTENASE releases the active protein digesting enzymes Pepsin, Papayotin and Bromelain in the first phase in the stomach, where protein digestion begins.</P>
 <P>  When food leaves the acidic stomach, it enters the more alkaline intestinal environment. Each phase of the SUSTENASE tablet is buffered to conform to each environment to provide maximum activity of the enzymes in each location.  In its second phase, SUSTENASE releases Pancreatin, a concentrated mixture of enzymes that digest proteins, fats and complex carbohydrates (starches).  It also releases Pancrelipase, a highly active form of concentrated pancreas enzymes that is especially good for fat digestion plus Ox Bile concentrate for the emulsification and digestion of fats.</P>
<P>   Because indigestion is such a widespread problem, SUSTENASE is one of the most popular Life Plus products, one that should be taken by just about everyone. Without proper digestion, the food we eat is of no value to us, no matter how many nutrients are in it. Improper digestion may also cause food allergies as well as other types of allergies.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>   SUSTENASE is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
   When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE IT</H2>
<P>   Take one or more SUSTENASE tablets with each meal. It is best to take them as you begin the meal so the digestive enzymes and buffering agents can be mixed well with the food being eaten. With large meals and those high in fats and heavy proteins such as large steak dinners, etc. more tablets can be taken if desired. If you should forget and not take your SUSTENASE at the beginning of the meal, take it later in the meal or even after the meal is eaten. You will still obtain benefits from it.</P>
 
<P> 
Suggested Use:  One to two tablets at the beginning of each meal. But can be taken during or just after 
meals. Do not refrigerate. </P>
