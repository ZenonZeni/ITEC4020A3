<h2 align=center>FACT&nbsp;SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Inclusion: Obtaining A Free Appropriate Public Education
(FAPE) and Placement for Your Child</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee,
<br>in consultation with Reed Martin, Esq.
<br>November 1995</b></p>

<h4>DEAR LEARNING DISABILITIES ASSOCIATION:</h4>

<p>Last week at my child's annual Individual Education Plan (IEP) meeting
the teacher said that students in special education programs will now receive
all special education services in inclusive general education classrooms.
Last year my child received special education services for reading and
written language in a resource room and made progress in both areas, I
do want my child in the regular classroom but I know he continues to need
direct and special help in reading and written language, If he does receive
all of his special education in the general education classroom and does
not make progress what can I do? </p>

<h4>DEAR CONCERNED PARENT:</h4>

<p>The IEP meeting you attended was not legal. Before such a change in
delivery of special education services, your school must do two things.
First, a reasonable time prior to that meeting your school must have given
you in writing notice of what they would be proposing; why they would propose
it; what alternatives they considered; why those alternatives were rejected;
a description of each evaluation procedure, test, record or report they
used as a basis for their proposal; and any other relevant factors, [34CRF
300.505]. Second, your child is also protected under Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act and The Americans with Disabilities Act. The school
must have conducted a re-evaluation of your child before proposing this
change, [34CRF 104.36]. You should demand both from your school district
even though it is after the fact. </p>

<p>The purpose behind the philosophy of 'inclusion' is to make sure that
all children have the opportunity to be educated in the same environment
as their non disabled peers. For many students in special education, innovative
programs in the regular classroom are fulfilling their needs. For other
students the opposite is true. Some children with learning disabilities
and/or attention disorders learn better in a resource room. The decision
as to <b>where</b> your child receives special education must be based
on your child's individual needs, not by what program the school offers.
</p>

<p><b>According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
all special education students must be educated in The Least Restrictive
Environment (LRE), which is often mistakenly interpreted as meaning that
the student must receive special education services in the regular or general
classroom</b>. The Least Restrictive Environment is decided after the individual
needs of the student are determined and written in the Individualized Education
Plan (IEP). If, with services in the regular classroom with the use of
supplemental aids and services, your child is not meeting his/her goals
on the IEP, then educating the child in a different environment like a
resource room for some portion of the day is one factor that should be
taken into consideration. The law is very clear in stating that in determining
the LRE a full continuum of placements (regular classroom, resource room,
self contained classroom placement etc.) must be available when making
placement decision for students in special education programs. In the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) under Continuum of alternative placements
300.552(b)(2), the resource room is specifically mentioned as an environment
where special education services can be delivered. </p>

<p>The ultimate goal in IDEA is to make sure that all students in special
education programs receive a <b>Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)</b>.
Since all special education FAPE decisions are supposed to be made according
to your child's individual needs it is essential that you know and understand
your child's abilities and disabilities so that you will be able to give
well informed input as to what is appropriate or inappropriate in terms
of goals, objectives, learning styles, environment and placement. One way
of doing this is to familiarize yourself with all of the evaluation reports.
The evaluation report should include information on your child's abilities
and disabilities and how they are impacting both academic areas and the
entire school day. If you need a better understanding of the report, request
an appointment with your school psychologist, diagnostician or special
education teacher. </p>

<p>To make sure that your child is benefiting from his current individualized
education program (IEP) there are a number of things you can do: </p>

<p>1. Ask in writing for an IEP meeting. <b>According to law every IEP
must state the students 'Current Level of Performance &quot;in all areas
where your child is identified as needing special education.&quot;</b>
This statement should accurately describe the effect of the child's disability
on the child's performance in every area of education that is affected,
including (i) academic areas (reading, math, communication, etc,), and
(2) non academic areas (daily life activities, mobility, etc.)&quot; [34
CRF Sec. 300.345, Appendix e. Question 36]. Make sure that necessary academic
performance levels are addressed in a specific and meaningful way. If assessments
in those are not current, request that they be done right away so that
the IEP can properly address educational needs. Once the academic levels
are known, request that the special education teacher track the students
progress through frequent informal assessments. Have this frequent monitoring
written as part of the IEP and also designate how often the assessments
should occur. The Supreme Court has stated [Board of Education v. Rowley
(1982)] that &quot;parents are to be involved in assessing the effectiveness
of the program.&quot; So ask for things to be written into the assessment
that You can observe and report on, such as homework, behavior, etc. </p>

<p>2. Keep samples of all of your child's homework, tests, quizzes and
classwork. This will help keep you aware of progress and might come in
handy later on for use as documentation. </p>

<p>3. Find out how the special education services are being delivered to
your child in the regular classroom. </p>

<ul>
<li>How much time on a daily basis does the special education teacher spend
in the general education classroom? </li>

<li>How much time does the special education teacher spend with your child
giving direct instruction? </li>

<li>Does the teacher work one on one with your child or with small groups
of students? How many children are in the group? </li>

<li>Is the special education teacher certified in the area of learning
disabilities? </li>

<li>Is the instruction and curriculum designed with your child's educational
needs in mind? </li>

<li>Are learning strategies and organizational skills part of the daily
instruction? </li>

<li>How does this compare with the special education your child received
last year? </li>
</ul>

<p>4. If your child's academic skills do not seem to be progressing as
well this year in a general education classroom setting as they were last
year in a resource room setting, <i>ask the school system for written justification</i>
explaining on what they based their change of environmental placement decision,
Since the school system made the change in placement from a resource room
to the general education classroom based on a blanket policy of inclusion
without taking into consideration the individual needs of your child, it
is up to them to prove that this is the correct learning environment for
your child based on his individual needs. </p>

<p>5. If you continue to feel that your child needs a different special
educational setting, request in writing for your child to receive services
in a special education resource pull out program. State that you are requesting
that the school change the placement and provision of a free appropriate
education for your child and that they answer your letter within thirty
days. The school must then notify you in writing if they refuse to change
your child's placement. That notice must tell you: (1 ) What they are refusing,
(2) Why they are refusing it, (3) What alternatives they considered, (4)
Why they rejected those alternatives, (5) Every test, record, examination
or other report that forms the basis for their refusal, and (6) Any other
relevant factors. If the school district will not issue such written notice,
file a written complaint with your state education agency. </p>

<p>6. Ask in writing for an independent evaluation at public expense on
the issue whether reasonable educational outcomes can be achieved under
the current IEP and ask for the suggestions of names of independent evaluators
the school would recommend to perform the service privately. If you are
not familiar with names on the list contact your local Learning Disabilities
Association chapter for information. </p>

<p>7. Work with your local LDA chapter or other parents to make a presentation
to your school board on the lack of continuum of placements/different learning
environments and what the law mandates. </p>

<p>It is hoped that the IEP team will work with you in making sure that
your child is progressing in his educational program and that if a different
setting for his education becomes necessary that the team will make the
recommendation to change the environment where special education services
are carried out. Then steps 4, 5, 6, and 7 (as listed above) will not be
needed. It is important for everyone to remember that full inclusion is
a philosophy, not a mandate supported by law. With that thought in mind
all children in special education programs should be able to receive a
free appropriate public education (FAPE), designed to meet their individual
needs. </p>
