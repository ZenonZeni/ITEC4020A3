<p> The Central Kingdom </p>

<p> At the end of the 1800s China's four million square miles
held 450 million people, up from 200 million a century earlier.
The ruling dynasty was the Ching, established by Manchus from
Manchuria, who in 1644 had superseded the Ming. These descendants
of the Tatars appreciated Chinese civilization and adopted a
conciliatory attitude toward their subjects. They refused,
however, to allow intermarriage with the Chinese, for they
realized that only their blood difference kept them from being
assimilated and conquered. By and large, however, the Manchus
gradually became Chinese in their attitudes and habits. </p>

<p> The Manchu emperors were remarkably successful. The reign of
Chien-lung (1736-1795) was a time of great expansion. The Manchus
gained Turkestan, Burma, and Tibet. By the end of the eighteenth
century Manchu power extended even into Nepal, and the territory
under the Ching control was as extensive as under any previous
dynasty. </p>

<p> The Western Response </p>

<p> The foreigners were especially irritated by the high customs
duties the Chinese forced them to pay and by the attempts of
Chinese authorities to stop the growing import trade in opium.
The drug had long been used to stop diarrhea, but in the
seventeenth and eighteenth century people in all classes began to
use it recreationally. Most opium came from Turkey or India, and
in 1800 its import was forbidden by the imperial government.
Despite this restriction, the opium trade continued to flourish.
Privately owned vessels of many countries, including the United
States, made huge profits from the growing number of Chinese
addicts. The government in Peking noted that the foreigners
seemed intent on dragging down the Chinese through the
encouragement of opium addiction. </p>

<p> [See Opium Factory: The stacking room at an opium factory in
Patna, India. Opium smuggling upset the balance of trade and
destroyed China's economy.] </p>

<p> In the meantime, the empire faced other problems. The army
became corrupt and the tax farmers defrauded the people. The
central bureaucracy declined in efficiency, and the generally
weak emperors were unable to meet the challenges of the time. The
balance of trade turned against the Chinese in the 1830s, and the
British decided to force the issue of increased trade rights. The
point of conflict was the opium trade. By the late 1830s more
than 30,000 chests, each of which held about 150 pounds of the
extract, were being brought in annually by the various foreign
powers. Some authorities assert that the trade in opium alone
reversed China's formerly favorable balance of trade. In the
spring of 1839 Chinese authorities at Canton confiscated and
burned the opium. In response, the British occupied positions
around Canton. </p>

<p> In the war that followed, the Chinese could not match the
technological and tactical superiority of the British forces. In
1842 China agreed to the provisions of the Treaty of Nanking.
Hong Kong was ceded to Great Britain, and other ports, including
Canton, were opened to British residence and trade. It would be a
mistake to view the conflict between the two countries simply as
a matter of drug control; it was instead the acting out of deep
cultural conflicts between east and west. </p>

<p> The French and Americans approached the Chinese after the
Nanking Treaty's provisions became known, and in 1844 gained the
same trading rights as the British. The advantages granted the
three nations by the Chinese set a precedent that would dominate
China's relations with the world for the next century. The
&quot;most favored nation&quot; treatment came to be extended so
far that China's right to rule in its own territory was limited.
This began the period referred to by the Chinese as the time of
unequal treaties - a time of unprecedented degradation for China.
The humiliation the Central Kingdom suffered is still remembered
and strongly affects important aspects of its foreign policy.
Meanwhile, the opium trade continued to thrive. </p>

<p> The British and French again defeated China in a second opium
war in 1856. By the terms of the Treaty of Tientsin (1858) the
Chinese opened new ports to trading and allowed foreigners with
passports to travel in the interior. Christians gained the right
to spread their faith and hold property, thus opening up another
means of western penetration. The United States and Russia gained
the same privileges in separate treaties. </p>
