<P>
New York State Psychiatric Institute (N.Y.S.P.I.), the oldest psychiatric
research institute in the United States and one of the largest devoted to
mental health research in the world, has a three-fold mandate: <A HREF="#PI_Research">research</A>,
<A HREF="#PI_Education">education and training</A>, and <A HREF="#PI_Clinical">clinical services</A>.
<P>
Its history is one of significant accomplishments.  Among the most
illustrious are the establishment of the relationship between paresis and
the spirochete responsible for syphilis, the creation of the key
experimental animal model for the study of epilepsy, the first psychiatric
research program in genetics in the country, the introduction to the U.S.
of lithium carbonate, which has been the most successful treatment of
manic-depression, and the completion of DSM-III, the official diagnostic
manual of the American Psychiatric Association.
<P>
Renowned for its past achievements, it continues to make contributions to
the understanding of mental disorders, to the care of people with mental
disabilities, and to the prevention of mental disease.

<P>
More than three hundred biological, behavioral, and social reseach
studies are being conducted at Psychiatric Institute.
<P>
A view of the Institute at any given time will reveal laboratory
technicians in the neuroscience laboratories examining the serotonin
protein, which facilitates communication between neurons in the brain.  A
few floors below, clinical histories are being recorded in the Depression
Evaluation Service to determine whether a patient suffers from chronic
endogenous depression, atypical depression where some capacity for
pleasure remains, or from another variant of depressive disorder.
Clinical psychopharmacologists, just down the hall, discuss with cautious
optimism the efficacy of a drug which seems to curb the craving for
cigarette smoking, while their neighbors weigh the advantages of using
antidepressant medication in the treatment of bulimia.
<P>
Not far away, in the Anxiety Disorders CLinic, patients who have for
years been virtually housebound because of the fear of public places
(agoraphobia) are discovering that within a few months of combined
treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and psychotherapy they can
resume normal activities.
<P>
In the developmental psychobiology laboratories of the Lawrence C. Kolb
Research Laboratory Building, the 14 story annex of Psychiatric
Institute, scientists are observing the behavior of infant rats separated
from their mothers.  They have concluded that premature maternal
deprivation produces a collection of adverse physiological and behavioral
responses whose long-term effects may include vulnerability to disease.
<P>
In the Howard Hughes Institute in Molecular Neurobiology and Behavior,
established at P.I. because of the widely recognized scientific strengths
of its researchers in neuroscience, the simple nervous cell structure of
the marine snail, Aplysia, serves as the basis for extensive and
innovative investigations of the mechanisms of learning and memory.
<P>
Some researchers in Child Psychiatry are investigating the use of drugs in treating hyperactive children; others are trying to make sense out of the rash of teen-age suicides that have plagued many communities recently.
<P>
And, with the city as a laboratory, epidemiologists are examining data on the characteristics of the homeless population using New York City shelters; others are doing longitudinal studies of the course of mental illness in children.
<P>
Sponsored research projects at P.I. totaling over twelve million dollars annually, are administered through the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene.  Results from some of these projects will eventually produce breakthroughs as remarkable as those for which the Institute is already famous.
<HR>
<U><A NAME = "PI_Education"><A HREF = "/NYSPI/PI_EDDP.HTM"><B>EDUCATION and TRAINING</B></A></A></U>
<P>
The Institute provides psychiatric training for medical students from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, and residency training for psychiatrists, including programs at the Creedmoor and Middletown Psychiatric Centers.
<P>
A post-residency fellowship in public psychiatry trains psychiatrists who plan to pursue careers as leaders in public sector mental health.
<P>
A fellowship program in Child Psychiatry and research fellowships in specialized areas are also offered here and at other state facitlities.
<P>
Other training includes programs in psychology, social work, and nursing.
<HR>
<U><A NAME = "PI_Clinical"><A HREF = "/NYSPI/PI_RCDP.HTM"><B>CLINICAL SERVICES</B></A></A></U>
<P>
Committed to the community in which it is located, P.I.'s Washington Heights Community Service treats a total of 700 people a year at its outpatient and full-care inpatient units.  Inpatient clinical services are also available to people participating in research programs.
<P>
Special purpose outpatient clinics, combining research and treatment, serve close to 4,000 people annually from the entire metropolitan area.  These range from a depression and attempted suicide clinic for children and adolescents to a sexual agression clinic engaged in reversing the aberrant habits of sexual offenders.
<P>
The multi-disciplinary nature of Psychiatric Institute provides its scientists with the ideal environment for both independent and collaborative research and its students with ample opportunity to acquire the most sophisticated knowledge in the field.
