<h1>MARIJUANA AND THE HUMAN BODY </h1>

<p><b>The Common Sense Series</b> </p>

<p><b>a publication of the National Organization</b> <b>for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>The moderate use of marijuana is neither harmless nor
devastating to the user. Unfortunately, the politics of marijuana
has distorted research findings and made it difficult to find out
the truth about marijuana's effect on human health. NORML
believes that honest, verifiable information is the most
effective tool to prevent the abuse of marijuana. This text
examines the effects of marijuana on the human body, as described
by a comprehensive report prepared for the Federal government by
the most respected scientific body in the United States, the
National Academy of Sciences. This text first examines some of
the exaggerated claims made about marijuana and then provides the
truth about marijuana's effects on human health. </p>

<p><b>EXAGGERATED CLAIMS ABOUT MARIJUANA</b> </p>

<p>Despite evidence to the contrary, many individuals and
organizations maintain that marijuana is an extremely dangerous
drug. For example, the National Federation of Parents for Drug
Free Youth attempts to reach its societal and legislative goals
by making the following claims: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Marijuana is a harmful substance because it has 421
        chemicals. </li>
    <li>Marijuana is stronger than it was 10 years ago, and this
        new, potent marijuana presents dangers unrecognized years
        ago. </li>
    <li>Marijuana is far worse for the lungs than tobacco. </li>
    <li>Marijuana causes damage to the reproductive system. </li>
    <li>The psychoactive chemicals in marijuana are fat soluble
        and stay in the human body for a month, increasing the
        danger of exposure. </li>
    <li>Marijuana causes brain damage and a behavioral disorder
        known as amotivational syndrome. </li>
    <li>Any use of marijuana is abuse, and marijuana has no
        medical value whatsoever. </li>
</ol>

<p>The National Federation of Parents supports prohibition of
marijuana because it believes that marijuana is so dangerous that
no one can use it safely. According to the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, which supports the NFP, many parents welcomed
discovery of reports suggesting marijuana's harmfulness because
the claims reinforced their own instincts about marijuana. </p>

<p>In fact, the reports used to justify the above claims have
been found to be inconclusive by other researchers. Hence,
warnings intended to dramatize the supposed ill-effects of
marijuana are often couched with phrases like &quot;marijuana
can...&quot;. &quot;Marijuana may...&quot;, or &quot;If the
experts are right...&quot;. </p>

<p><b>THE TRUTH ABOUT MARIJUANA</b> </p>

<p>The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences
conducted a 15-month study of the health-related effects of
marijuana in 1982. They appointed a 22-member committee to
analyze existing scientific evidence bearing on the possible
hazards to the health and safety of users of marijuana. </p>

<p>The report concludes: &quot;the scientific evidence published
to date indicates that marijuana has a broad range of
psychological and biological effects, some of which, at least
under certain circumstances, are harmful to human health&quot;. </p>

<p>In a companion report providing policy recommendations to the
Academy's National Research Council, regulation of the marijuana
market is advocated as the most effective method of controlling
marijuana. The National Academy of Science's report rebuts many
of the exaggerated claims made about marijuana. </p>

<ol>
    <li>Of the 421 chemicals in marijuana, only 61 are unique to
        marijuana. The chemicals are known as cannabinoids. One
        of them, delta-9 THC, produces the psychoactive effect
        and is the focus of most research. The other 360
        chemicals in the marijuana plant are found throughout
        other natural substances. </li>
    <li>The higher potency marijuana grown in the United States
        represents about half of all the marijuana consumed here.
        Because of it's higher potency many smokers use far less
        of it than less potent marijuana. </li>
    <li>Differences in dosage and frequency of consumption render
        comparisons between marijuana and tobacco consumption
        invalid, despite similarity in the composition of their
        smoke. Marijuana smoke irritates the lungs. Heavy
        exposure of the lungs to irritation such as smoke
        increases the likelihood of lung cancer and other lung
        problems. Marijuana speeds the heartbeat and is unhealthy
        for people with high blood pressure or other
        cardiovascular ailments. </li>
    <li>Marijuana does reduce the sperm count and obstruct sperm
        mobility in males within the normal range. These
        side-effects do not seem to affect human fertility, and
        are completely reversible thirty days after cessation of
        use. Marijuana, like other drugs, crosses the placenta.
        While the effects of this are unknown and there is no
        evidence that marijuana causes chromosome damage, we
        advise women to avoid the use of marijuana, tobacco,
        alcohol, or other drugs not prescribed by their physician
        during pregnancy and nursing. </li>
    <li>The intoxicating chemical, THC, is broken down by the
        human metabolism after two or three hours in the body.
        The by-products of this chemical breakdown are referred
        to as metabolites. These metabolites are fat soluble, and
        take 21-30 days to leave the human body via the urine.
        These metabolites exert no psychoactive effect on the
        human body. </li>
    <li>After reviewing all of the evidence, the Academy
        concluded: &quot;There is not yet any conclusive evidence
        as to whether prolonged use of marijuana causes permanent
        changes in the nervous system or sustained impairment of
        brain function and behavior in human beings&quot;.
        &quot;Interpretation of the evidence linking marijuana to
        'amotivational syndrome' is difficult. Such symptoms have
        been known to occur in the absence of marijuana. Even if
        there is an association between this syndrome and the use
        of marijuana, that does not prove that marijuana causes
        the syndrome. Many troubled individuals seek an 'escape'
        into use of drugs: thus frequent use of marijuana may
        become one more in a series of conterproductive behaviors
        for these unhappy people&quot;. </li>
    <li>&quot;Cannabis and it's derivatives have shown promise in
        the treatment of a variety of disorders. The evidence is
        most impressive in glaucoma, where their mechanism of
        action appears to be different from standard drugs: in
        asthma.... and in the nausea and vomiting of cancer
        chemotherapy... Similar trials have suggested cannabis
        might also be used in seizures, spasticity, and other
        nervous system disorders&quot;. </li>
</ol>

<p><b>N O R M L ' s V I E W</b> </p>

<p>1. NORML favors discouraging marijuana abuse and is opposed to
adolescent drug use. </p>

<p>2. Exaggerated claims about health hazards lack credibility
and encourage adolescents to try marijuana and other drugs.
Government research which relies on animal studies and studies of
adolescent drug abusers presents a skewed perspective of
marijuana's effects. </p>

<p>3. The illegality of marijuana, because it equates use with
abuse, discourages frank discussion of marijuana's effects on
health within the family and with doctors and nurses. </p>

<p>4. Over 35 million adult Americans use marijuana regularly
because they find it a relatively safe way to relax. A regulated
marijuana market would better protect their health than the
unregulated black market. </p>
