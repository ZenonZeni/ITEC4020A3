<H1>WALKERS CAY</H1>
<H2>"The Best Shark Dive in the Caribbean"</H2>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Although you will not see a Great White Shark as on our expedition to South Africa, you will at Walkers Cay, experience one of the most thrilling and extraordinary shark dives in the world!  For many decades Walkers has been famous for its billfishing tournaments.  Now this 100 acre island is equally famous for the diving experiences it offers.  
<P><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="lastWS3.jpg" WIDTH="260" HEIGHT="178">There are numerous good reasons to dive the reefs of Walkers but their Shark Dive is undoubtedly the headliner.  Caribbean Reef, Bull, Nurse and Black Tip sharks are all commonplace.  Occasionally a Lemon or Hammerhead will appear in what usually numbers as 60 to 90 sharks per dive.  Gary Adkison, island Manager, para medic, dive Shop Manager, Dive Instructor, pilot and staunch shark researcher and conservationist, has with his equally talented team, devised an ingenious method to attract, observe and tag the sharks.  A barrel full of fish carcasses is frozen around an iron frame.  Once divers are in position, this shark hors-deurve is anchored to the bottom and suspended by a float about 8 feet above.  Sharks already present, having been attracted by the noise of the dive boat, tear at the chum and as this is dissipated in the water column it in turn attracts further sharks.  The result is an unbelievable experience of sharks converging from all directions.  Far from being unnerving, one is surprised and put at ease by the sharks' complete ambivalence to your presence.  As you become more brave, you are free to swim around in this aquarium of sharks.  This is a true educational experience as well as a dive of a lifetime and many people do it 3 or 4 times in a week.
<P><IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="LastWS1.jpg" WIDTH="312" HEIGHT="203">The Sharks although a major attraction are not its only asset.  Walkers Cay is just 45 minutes flight from Ft Lauderdale International Airport.  The most Northerly island of the Abaco chain just140 miles from Ft Lauderdale and 45 miles NE of Freeport.  No cars are present and the only mode of transportation is by golf cart.  Surrounded by low lying reefs, clear waters and an abundance of marine life it is the ideal location for recreational divers of all levels.  Many divers complete their open water certification here(be warned you will have to search far and wide to top this experience).  Shallow Virgin reefs provide caves, caverns and crevices.  This back drop along with visibility often exceeding 100 feet make it an underwater photographers paradise.  Schools of African Pompano, Amberjack, Spadefish, Groupers, Angel fish and French Grunts are common place.  Dive sites, on average, are a mere 15-20 minutes boat ride from the dock.  Two dives in the morning followed by one in the afternoon is the norm.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="lastWS2.jpg" WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="170"> <IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="lastWS4.jpg" WIDTH="113" HEIGHT="170">Accommodation and hospitality are relaxed but still of the highest order.  There is a choice of accomodation from single accommodation in the small hotel to a 3 bedroom 3 bath beach-side house.  The restaurant has a typical Bahamian ambiance, with seafood not surprisingly top of the menu.  There are two tennis courts, two swimming pools, a spa, table tennis table, TV room and of course the Blue Marlin bar.
