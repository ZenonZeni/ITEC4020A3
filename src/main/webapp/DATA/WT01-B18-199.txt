<H4>a. Electric Vehicles</H4>
<BR>
</B>Electric vehicles are the closest thing to a nonpolluting 
transportation medium. Their only adverse effects on the environment would 
be linked to the generation of electricity to charge their batteries and, 
possibly, to disposal of the batteries (although recycling may dispel this 
concern).<a href="#279" name="r279"> [ 279 ] </a>Although the initial price of electric cars will likely be 
higher than the price of internal combustion engine vehicles, electric 
vehicles will have lower overall life-cycle costs.<a href="#280" name="r280"> [ 280 ] </a>Inadequate 
batteries, at present, are the only significant obstacle to widespread 
use.<a href="#281" name="r281"> [ 281 ] </a><P>
<B><p>     <I>South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), 
California.</B></I> In July 1995, SCAQMD unveiled a two-year "Electric 
Vehicle Incentive" program to help bring electric vehicles to the market. 
Beginning in 1996, SCAQMD will offer a $5,000 discount for motorists 
purchasing an electric vehicle, up to a total of 1,200 vehicles. The 
vehicles will be required to meet certain minimum performance 
specifications and all federal motor vehicle safety standards. In addition 
to this program, SCAQMD will use an additional $1 million to encourage the 
development of electric vehicle corridors. Under this program, groups of 
three or more clustered cities along designated corridors can apply for 
matching funds to help develop electric vehicle infrastructure.<BR>

</B><p>     <B><I><A NAME="GeneralMotorsCorporation">General Motors Corporation<a>. </B></I>Many manufacturers 
are moving ahead with electric vehicle production. General Motors 
originally unveiled its "Impact" model in 1990.<a href="#282" name="r282"> [ 282 ] </a>The Impact, with a 
composite body and stiff aluminum frame, incorporates an advanced electric 
motor, electronic controls, regenerative braking, and aerodynamic 
streamlining. The energy cost of running an Impact is only a quarter that 
of a gasoline-powered car. The driving range, however, is limited to about 
100 miles by its 1,100 pounds of lead-acid batteries.<a href="#283" name="r283"> [ 283 ] </a>Nevertheless, 
those who have test-driven an Impact have on the whole given it rave 
reviews for its quiet ride, maneuverability, and rapid acceleration.<a href="#284" name="r284"> [ 284 ] </a>
Even counting the emissions from the power plants used to charge it, the 
Impact produces two-thirds less pollution than California will allow under 
its 1998 ultra-low emission standard,285 and 72 percent less carbon 
dioxide than is emitted by a 1994 Ford Taurus.<a href="#286" name="r286"> [ 286 ] </a>
<BR>
<p>     <B><I><A NAME="Clean,IntelligentTransportation,Inc."> Clean, Intelligent Transportation, Inc </a>. (CITI).</B></I> 
Calstart and a Norwegian consortium joined forces recently and unveiled a 
personal electric car designed for affordability, with a sticker price of 
less than $10,000. The new company, Clean, Intelligent Transportation, 
Inc., will bring the new car, the PIVCO CITI, to California, and plans to 
begin manufacturing there by late 1996 or early 1997. The car is a roomy 
two-passenger vehicle that will be marketed as a commuter car for use as a 
family's second car to be used primarily for commuting and running errands 
around town. The car will run at freeway speeds, includes air 
conditioning, and will, with its dual air-bags, meet U.S. safety 
standards. The car will have a range of 60 to 80 miles between 
charges.<a href="#287" name="r287"> [ 287 ] </a>
<p>     <BR>
<p>     <B><I><A NAME="SolectriaCorporation">Solectria Corporation<a>. </B></I>Solectria, of Wilmington, 
Massachusetts, has produced a lightweight electric sedan with the standard 
features typical of sedans on the market today. With its aerodynamic 
styling, the new <I>Sunrise</I> sedan incorporates a state-of-the-art AC 
induction drive system and a driving range of 120 miles per charge, using 
advanced lead-acid batteries. (Enhanced range is expected as superior 
battery technologies are introduced in the future. A <I>Sunrise</I> 
prototype using a nickel metal-hydride battery has logged 238 miles in 
mixed city-highway driving without stopping for a charge.) The two-door, 
four-passenger electric vehicle includes power brakes, dual air bags, 
cruise control, automatic battery thermal management for winter driving, 
efficient electric air conditioning/heating, and a sophisticated onboard 
battery charging and monitoring system. The car accelerates from zero to 
30 mph in 6 seconds, zero to 60 mph in 17 seconds, and maintains a 
cruising speed of 75 mph. The vehicle is projected to cost $20,000 at a 
mass-production level of 20,000 units, and will be available in 1998. Over 
the past 6 years, Solectria vehicles have consistently achieved top honors 
for efficiency, range and performance.<a href="#288" name="r288"> [ 288 ] </a>

Batteries can be recharged during off-peak hours when excess generating 
capacity is available. The prospect of recharging at night presents 
electric utilities with an opportunity to operate more efficiently by 
allowing them to draw power from otherwise idle capacity. Sperling, D.,

American</I>, Vol. 273, No. 3, p. 105 (New York, NY: September 1995). The 
vehicle battery market is not yet mature. The most expensive component in 
the electric driveline is the battery. Currently available lead-acid 
batteries last less than two years and 20,000 miles and do not store 
enough energy to power a full-size vehicle very far or fast. But major 
improvements are expected, especially as the California ZEV mandate 
approaches in 1998. <I>See</I> <I>Id., </I>pp. 48-49.<BR>

storage capacity of lead-acid batteries by 50 percent or more, while other 
research teams are seeking to adapt the more efficient but costlier 
nickel-cadmium and lithium batteries used in computers and other 
electronic devices. A 1994 study by the California Air Resources Board 
suggests that battery technology continues to advance rapidly, and that by 
the end of this decade new batteries may double the 60- to 100-mile range 
typical of today's electric cars. In the longer run, still lower costs and 
greater storage capacities are within reach. <I>Id.,</I> pp. 211-12.<BR>
