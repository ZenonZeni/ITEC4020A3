NewsNet gives fiber optic testing company <BR>
worldwide coverage of telecom topics</H2><BR CLEAR=ALL>


Ed Ballentine, a business researcher for Geo-Com Inc., a telecommunications engineering
company based in Fairfax, Virginia, is responsible for knowing "everything in the world" that's going on in the telecommunications industry, and for keeping Geo-Com's staff of engineers informed of pertinent news and developments.  Geo-Com specializes in fiber optic cable testing and evaluation--a rapidly growing field in today's high-tech world.<P>

NewsFlash, one of Ed's favorite NewsNet features, is very useful in doing his job.  "I like NewsNet because I can put in a search statement, get the headlines, and choose the article that I want in full text right away. On other services, you are not able to browse and choose nearly as easily." He signs on to NewsNet every day to check his NewsFlash hits and to conduct targeted searches relative to the latest advancements in telecommunications around the globe.  <P>

The convenient grouping of services covering the telecommunications industry is a principal reason Ed uses NewsNet so frequently, as well as the broad telecommunications coverage offered by NewsNet. "Special searches are much easier to conduct with NewsNet's industry grouping," stated Ed. "And we always know what's being published in the area."<P>

In addition to NewsFlash and the quick full-text retrieval methods, Ed likes NewsNet because of its extensive worldwide coverage.  "My favorite attribute would be the worldwide coverage available on NewsNet.  If  I need to know what the latest developments are in Saudi Arabia, I know that the information is going to be found in a number of newsletters and wires that are on the system. I feel confident that NewsNet covers the entire waterfront in delivering the latest breaking news in a timely fashion."<P>
