Physical Optics Coporation (POC) has developed a unique holographic Light 
Shaping Diffuser (LSD) screen technology. The Light Shaping Diffuser 
controls the light energy distribution within a desired elliptical or 
circular solid angle, providing at least one order of magnitude better 
display brightness as compared to currently used Lambertian diffusers. <P>

POC's potential diffuser applications include: (1) consumer TV projection 
screens, high contrast screens for use in LCDs, and projection screens 
for overhead and slide projectors; (ii) beam homogenizers for OEM systems 
such as spectrometers, blood analyzers, and endoscopes; and (iii) beam 
shapers for lighting products such as flashlights, automotive interior 
lighting, bar code scanners, lighted signs, 3-D displays, and cockpit 
displays. <P>

For the next five years, display devices are projected to 
experience "meteoric growth" (Electronic News, 1994). POC is confident 
that its Light Shaping Diffusers will become an integral part of these 
display devices. POC has a strong patent position in diffuser products 
and is pursuing joint ventures and licensing agreements to address those 
opportunities that are beyond the companies corporate capabilities.<P>

POC participated in the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) which helped 
POC to optimize the Light Shaping Diffuser fabrication process, develop 
the diffuser pattern replication methodology and optimize perfomance of 
the LCD. As a result, POC was able to increase its market share both in 
the U.S. and abroad. Since the completion of the ATP, we have further 
enhanced the performance, yield and manufacturing proceess to address 
specific customer requirements for LCD display, projection displays,  
directional displays, HDTV screen and cockpit displays. The technical 
advances achieved during the course of the ATP have improved diffuser 
performance in many systems, such as "remote source lighting". This has 
enabled POC to spin-off a subsidiary, "FarLight".<P>
