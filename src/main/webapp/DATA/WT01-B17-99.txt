<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> <I>What are the main health problems I might develop with my heart?</I>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> The most common causes of death and hospitalizations in the U.S. are coronary
occlusions and congestive heart failure. The latter is also called cardiomyopathy,
which means failure of the heart muscle. Coronary occlusion (blocking of the heart
arteries) is a process in which arteries that course over the surface of and
penetrate into the heart muscle become narrowed so that blood flow through them
becomes restricted. The heart muscle stops receiving adequate amounts of oxygen and
nutrients and a person develops angina, which is generally experienced as chest pain
or pressure. This means the heart muscle's pumping capacity has been exceeded.
Coronary occlusion is commonly caused by arteriosclerosis, which is a buildup of
plaque and clogging in the arteries, that can lead to heart attacks.

<P>There is also &quot;silent angina,&quot; which means a person may have shortness of breath,
numbness in the arm, dizzyness, or other vague symptoms that appear when they
overexert or become emotionally stressed. About one-half of all people with coronary
clogging develop this silent angina form of coronary occlusion. Unfortunately, often
the first time they know they have heart disease is when they have a sudden heart
attack. That's why coronary disease is such a common killer, because half the people
die before they ever reach the hospital.

<P>With congestive heart failure, the heart becomes literally congested with blood and
dangerously weakened, The most common cause of this is coronary occlusion and heart
attacks. After you &quot;kill&quot; a large section of your heart muscle by repeated heart
attacks, there is not enough heart muscle left to pump blood out of the heart. The
pressure and volume of blood inside the heart's pumping chamber build up, putting
additional pressure on arteries and veins in the lungs; fluid leaks into the lungs,
and the congestive heart failure process begins. A person knows he has this problem
when he has shortness of breath either with minimal exertion or when lying down at
night.

<FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> <I>What can alternative medicine recommend to prevent these problems or to improve my
heart condition?</I>


<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> All the causes of heart failure are reversible, to some degree, using a
multifactorial process. There are many people whose heart problems get steadily worse
until the only thing conventional medicine can offer is a heart transplant. Yet I've
had several patients in my practice who were told this and yet never had a
transplant. Instead, they used natural techniques to improve their heart muscle
function to the point at which they became active people again. Here's what you need
to do.
<A NAME="fatty"> </A>
<P>Your diet needs to move away from standard American fare toward one more plentiful in
uncooked vegetables, fruits, raw grains, seeds and nuts, but no peanuts. Reduce your
intake of dairy products, most animal meats, and refined white flour and sugar.
Increase your intake of fish oil, which is high in an omega-3 fatty acid called EPA
(eicosapentanoic acid). EPA prevents the formation of a clot-forming substance
involved in heart disease. 

<P>Completely avoid all fried foods and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils because
their trans-fatty acids increase atherosclerosis, probably even more so than butter.
Another nutrient important for reversing heart disease is magnesium, to prevent the
coronary arteries going into spasm. Magnesium deficiency is common in the U.S.
because it's lost from the kidneys whenever a person is under stress. (You don't know
any stressed people in America, do you?)
<A NAME="amino"> </A>
<P>Selenium deficiency is another common cause for atherosclerotic disease. For heart
health, you need about 200 mcg of elemental selenium a day. Other heart-healing
nutrients include vitamins E, C, beta carotene, bioflavonoids, B6 and B3,  and
sulfur-containing amino acids such as L-taurine, N-acetyl-cysteine, or glutathione. 
<A NAME="ANTIOX"> </A>
<P>Other substances helpful in reversing plaque formation in the arteries are the amino
acids L-lysine and L-proline. One of the antioxidants I used recently with excellent
success in assisting the reversal of atherosclerosis is pycnogenol from grape seeds
or maritime pine bark. Another useful nutrient is the amino acid L-carnitine that
helps to transport other amino acids and fatty acids into the cells. It's common to
find people, who have congestive heart failure, to be deficient in L-carnitine. It's
important to remember that all these nutrients work in concert with one another.

<FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> <I>What about cholesterol and heart disease?</I>


<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>
Most conventional medical doctors don't seem to understand some important points
about cholesterol. They see all cholesterol
 as bad, but this is incorrect. The only cholesterol that's &quot;bad&quot; is oxidized low
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. This is cholesterol that has
 been oxidized by oxygen or other free radical 
generators inside or outside the body. 

<P>This oxidized cholesterol is the kind that's responsible for the formation of cells
that lead to plaque formation on the artery walls. Cholesterol that your body
naturally makes does not do that. You find oxidized cholesterol in homogenized or
powdered milk, in powdered eggs, and in processed foods, for example. Oxidized
cholesterol accumulates in the white blood cells that form plaque in arteries.

<P>The other way you get high levels of oxidized cholesterol is when you're deficient in
antioxidant nutrients and under a lot of physical, emotional, or electromagnetic
stress. Then the healthy cholesterol your body makes every day is converted into
unhealthy, oxidized cholesterol.

<P>You need cholesterol because your body uses it to make bile salts which help absorb
the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), EPA, or other essential fatty substances from
your small intestine. Cholesterol is also converted into steroidal hormones, which
are critical for the health of the immune system, the mineral-regulating functions of
the kidneys, and for making male and female sex hormones.

<I>Digest,</I> No. 2, pp. 2-10.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>>
  
<P>Now, the brainwashing that conventional medicine puts out that high cholesterol is
always unhealthy is not true. I have a man in my practice who had a cholesterol count
between 300-400 for many years, but because he's taking high levels of antioxidant
nutrients and avoiding processed foods high in oxidized cholesterol, he's had no
plaque formation and has even had plaque regression.
<A NAME="Q10"> </A>
<P>Studies suggest that some of the common cholesterol-lowering drugs actually lower the
levels of the antioxidant coenzyme Q10 in the body. If these drugs produce a CoQ10
deficiency, this accelerates congestive heart failure. Studies show that most people
with congestive heart failure have a deficiency of CoQ10 in their heart muscle; the
lower the levels, the worse the congestive heart failure. 

<P>But studies also show that patients who were supposed to die 15 years ago from
congestive heart failure are still alive, primarily because of taking  coenzyme Q10
daily. This is perhaps why almost all of Japan uses coenzyme Q10 to replace cardiac
drugs.

<HR><A NAME="chela"> </A>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> Do you recommend chelation therapy as part of a heart-health maintenance program?


<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>
What I've been talking about here is a kind of oral, nonchemical chelation. There are
many studies that strongly suggest that intravenous EDTA chelation is effective. I
have seen patients that have gone through EDTA chelation who have had plaque reversal
without receiving any other treatment. Yes, chelation is a helpful and effective
therapy if you receive it from a physician certified in its use.

<BLOCKQUOTE>See <A HREF="../issue6/healer.html">"Ask the Healer,"</A> Digest, No. 6, 
pp. 27-28.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>


<P>As someone goes through EDTA chelation, it's important that they have adequate
amounts of mineral replacement in between each treatment. Another common mistake is
to get EDTA daily; this is inappropriate. At most, you should get only 3 treatments 
per week.

pp. 47-48</BLOCKQUOTE>.
<HR WIDTH=80%><A NAME="DENT"> </A>
<P>Finally, there is also a mouth factor. A large percentage 
of people who have heart disease have some type of abnormal process (such as a root
canal tooth or previous tooth extraction site) in the mouth. Most commonly this is an
infection of the jawbone, usually located at the third molar, or wisdom tooth site,
in any of the four jaw locations. 
Typically, the teeth on the left side of the mouth affect the left side of the heart;
those on the right side affect the right side of the heart. If doctors would
recognize and treat this, and work with biological dentists, many people who have
heart attacks, arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure, could see improvement in
their condition.
