 AUTO TRADE SHOW

 AUTO TRADE SHOW

1.  About the show:  The Canadian International Automotive Show
(CIAS) to be held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, April 14-16, 1996,
is expected to attract over 30,000 automotive aftermarket
professionals from all regions of Canada and the United States.
All segments of the automotive aftermarket industry will be
represented, including warehouse distributors, buying groups,
wholesalers, mass merchandisers, national accounts, sales agents,
national distributors, government buyers, fleet owners, car
dealers, owners of body/paint and specialty shops, as well as
garage/service station personnel.  The show will feature 900
booths, showcasing the products of more than 300 suppliers of
parts, equipment, accessories, products and services available
for sale to Canadian, as well as international aftermarket
retailers and automotive service companies. The Automotive
Industries Association of Canada (AIA) is the organizer of  CIAS,
a biennial show that alternates between Canada s two major
metropolises, Toronto and Montreal. CIAS  is Canada s largest
automotive aftermarket show.  The show will host a delegation of
300 foreign buyers from more than 40 countries in 1996.  In
addition to the USA Pavilion, CIAS will also present in Montreal
the  Future Store : the jobber store of the future featuring
three distinct areas: over-the-counter sales (retail),
professional sales,  and, warehousing, shipping and receiving
operations -- each highlighting the future of its area.

2.  About the market:  There are several favorable market
indicators that should convince U.S. firms to benefit from the
USA pavilion program and take part in Canada s largest automotive
aftermarket event.  Over the past four years, a fast-growing
Canadian demand for automotive aftermarket products in the
categories of glass and mirrors, light trucks and trailer parts,
instrumentation, garage equipment and supplies and aftermarket
accessories has been successfully satisfied by an increasing
number of U.S. suppliers.  U.S. exporters have nearly doubled
their Canadian business in these categories of products and
equipment. There is room for many more U.S.-made automotive
aftermarket products in Canada because a sustained,  strong
demand is anticipated over the next three years.  The vehicle-age
and vehicle-type composition of the Canadian fleet is now
transformed, thus creating a demand for an increasing variety of
technologically advanced, reliable and quality automotive
products and equipment.  Over the past five years, the Canadian
fleet of light trucks, including pick-up trucks, vans and sport
utility vehicles, jumped  from 3.9 million to 4.6 million, while
passenger cars slightly declined from 11.2 million to 11.0
million.  The Canadian automotive aftermarket largely depends on
imports which are valued at US$3.1 billion (point of entry), of
which nearly US$2.3 billion or 70 percent come from the United
States.  The USA Pavilion program is an ideal way to enter the
Canadian market, as well as an excellent way to increase your
sales to Canadian customers with whom you already do business.

3.  About the pavilion:  The USA Pavilion presented at CIAS  96
will offer a complete program for first-class access to the
Canadian automotive aftermarket.  Highly successful at CIAS 94 in
Toronto, the USA Pavilion will now move to CIAS 96 in Montreal,
again hosting U.S. firms ready to start on their way to
successfully penetrating the Canadian marketplace.  USA Pavilion
participants will benefit from: professionally designed and
fully-furnished  booth spaces located near the show entrance; a
promotional program which includes advanced industry-wide
publicity and on-site promotions; a direct mailing campaign
promoting participants  products and services -- targeted
exclusively to buyers, agents, dealers, wholesalers/distributors
and government agencies; a detailed exhibitor briefing featuring
experts on local market conditions and competitive practices;
personal on-site assistance provided by our fully bilingual CS
staff; and, a by-invitation-only cocktail reception to meet with
key Canadian Industry executives.

4.  The complete USA Pavilion Program is available to U.S. firms
on a first-come first-serve basis for a fee of US$2,595.
Participation is limited.  To receive registration forms and
complete details, call Pierre Richer, Commercial Service, U.S.
Department of Commerce,  Montreal: tel: 514-398-0673; fax: 514-
398-0711.

 PULP, PAPER INDUSTRY TRENDS

 PULP, PAPER INDUSTRY TRENDS

1.  Summary: After four straight years of losses, Eastern Canada-
based pulp and paper producers led Canada s forestry sector to a
brilliant recovery in 1995.  Primarily newsprint producers,
eastern Canadian pulp and paper producers have developed new
products to diversify their production over the past few years.
Spread in four of the five eastern provinces, the 116 mills in
operation  are generating combined profits that will exceed
US$1.5 billion in 1995, a return to profit levels only
experienced in the mid and late 80 s.   Eastern Canadian pulp and
paper producers are highly motivated to maintain their world
competitiveness through cost-efficiency and productivity, taking
into account the achievement of high levels of quality for their
products and compliance to environmental and international
standards.   U.S. firms who can help Canadian pulp and paper
producers achieve their goals will find excellent export business
opportunities in the Canadian market place. The Commercial
Service (CS) in Canada offers a direct and cost-efficient
assistance service to U.S. firms ready to explore Canada's pulp
and paper industry market.  (End summary)

 2.  Prices and exports are up in 1995 and the forest industry
will have spent, by year-end, close to US$1 billion in new
products development, environmental initiatives and  advanced
technology in Canada.  The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association
estimates that Canadian forest products companies have suffered
losses of over US$4 billion between 1991 and 1994.   Now, the
forestry industry sector is back in the leading group of Canada s
goods-producing industries with a forecast of combined profits of
U$$2.3 billion for 1995.  Much of this outstanding  recovery is
linked to the successes of eastern Canadian-based pulp and paper
products producers located in the provinces of New Brunswick,
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec.  In the first two
quarters of 1995, eastern Canadian pulp and paper producers have
reported profits nearing three quarters of a billion US dollars,
and they expect to more than double these profits to US$1.7
billion by year s end.

3.  Eastern Canada s  pulp and paper industry is favored by a
substantial forest base, deep water ports and a well-established
transportation network.  Composed of some 116 pulp and paper
mills, with more than half of those located in Quebec, eastern
Canadian mills vary quite significantly in size and increasingly
in product specialty, ranging from 100 to 1,300 tpd in capacity
and producing a variety of products from molded pulp egg trays to
lightweight coated printing papers. This mix of mill capacity and
product specialty is more noticeable in Quebec and Ontario than
in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.   However, eastern Canada is
primarily a newsprint producing region. Quebec and Ontario are,
respectively,  the first and second newsprint producing provinces
in Canada with production of 4.1 and 1.8 million tons per year.
Newfoundland s three mills are newsprint operations as well.

4.  Newsprint is not eastern Canada pulp and paper industry s
only strength.  Exports of printing and writing papers, for
example, now account for more than 14 percent of the total
industry s exports.  Over the years, an appreciable
diversification in the making of value-added products is also
worth mentioning for products like corrugating mediums, liner
board, chemic-thermomecanical pulp (CTMP) and bleached hardwood
and softwood kraft pulp, as well as lightweight coated papers.

5.  Current pulp and paper price improvements have pushed the
industry back to almost full production capacity levels. Profits
are definitely back and while the paying off of long-term debts
comes first on the agenda, pollution control and quality control
upgrades,  personnel training and machine automation and speedups
appear equally important to remain competitive and preserve the
industry s world market share.  Since the majority of eastern
Canadian mills export to the United States and other countries,
compliance with the International Standards Organization (ISO)
standards through a certification process has become necessary to
continue doing business.  These quality standards along with
environmental standards have rapidly gained  recognition within
the industry as being  instrumental to improving quality,
acquiring environmental acceptance and, as a result, maintaining
the industry s world market share.

6.  Canadian paper products have always enjoyed a reputation for
high quality which will only be maintained by producing
increasingly higher value paper grades and maintaining strict
adherence to internationally accepted standards, such as ISO
standards.  In addition, only large-scale investment in
computerized process control and other automation technologies
will help Canadian mills live up to their reputation.  Recent
Canadian statistics reveal that paper companies using at least
one type of advanced technology in their operations, such as
CAD/CAE systems, programmable controllers, manufacturing
information systems, for example, accounted for 86 percent of the
industry s shipments in 1993.  Those using at least 10
technologies already accounted for 23 percent of the shipments.
Canadian pulp and paper makers have presently achieved a
sufficient level of technological advancement to be well-
positioned in the international market place. To maintain that
advantage they are committed to constant up-grades to meet the
new challenges of the global economy.  This presents U.S.
manufacturers of goods and services for this industry with future
opportunities,  as it has with past ones in 1995.



7.  U.S. firms who can help Canadian pulp and paper makers
improve their production cost efficiency, quality and
environmental standards and their specialized employees  skills
will find excellent export business opportunities in the Canadian
market place. The Commercial Service  in Canada offers a direct
and cost-efficient assistance service to U.S. firms ready to
explore Canada's pulp and paper industry market with its  new
opportunities.  CS s Gold Key service is delivered by trade
specialists who arrange pre-screened appointments for each Gold
Key client.  This customized business service allows visiting
U.S. company representatives to develop an understanding of the
market in eastern Canada,  as well as in the rest of the country.

 CONSUMER TRENDS

 CONSUMER TRENDS

1. Summary:  A survey conducted by the Standards Council of
Canada (SCC) with more than 2000 Canadians provides, from a
unique angle, consumer profile information expressed through
consumers attitudes and expectations regarding standards
affecting the environment, health and other services, as well as
a number of consumer products.  An amazingly high 62 percent of
completed and returned survey questionnaires indicates that
Canadians express a high degree of interest for standards. The
survey concludes that Canadian consumers are most familiar with
products' safety and performance standards but lack familiarity
with standards affecting products  quality, environmental impact,
as well as with national and international standards in such
areas.  U.S. firms which market or intend to market consumer
products and services in Canada will want to learn more from this
survey by contacting SCC or any of the accredited standards
development organizations in Canada. (End summary)

2. Environment: The SCC survey indicates there is a clear and
significant priority attached to standards for drinking water
purity, waste disposal methods and air quality in buildings. In
addition to responding to the survey's environmental
standardization questions, 40 percent of respondents volunteered
comments on the subject. Many expressed concerns for insufficient
or inadequate standards in relation to forestry, outside air
quality, and motor vehicle emissions.

3. Health: The top three health-related standard priorities for
respondents were water safety and purity, food quality and
safety, particularly standards for levels of bacteria in food.
Most senior respondents gave high priority to presentation and
content of information standards concerning prescription and non-
prescription drugs. Other priorities identified in the survey's
section entitled "over 65" were standards for personal healthcare
equipment, personal monitoring or alarm systems for people living
alone, and standards regulating  print size on package labels.

4. Services: The SCC survey's under age 60 respondents showed a
strong interest in standards for education,  while day care
standards were a priority for more females than males in the
under 40 age category of respondents.  A priority regularly cited
by all age groups combined was that of the necessity of standards
for warranties and guaranties attached to products and services.

5. Products: In the SCC survey, Canadian consumers were asked to
indicate the level of importance they attach to standards for a
list of 23 products. Heat, smoke, and fire detection systems and
burglar alarms standards attracted the greatest frequency of
response. Following closely were concerns regarding proper
standards for child-resistant containers, tamper proof closures,
products for the physically handicapped, motorized vehicles and
equipment, circuit breakers and water treatment devices.

6. SCC concludes that the survey draws a portrait of a Canadian
population for which the level of knowledge about standards is
limited, even in areas of traditional consumer interest. Even if
respectively 70 and 57 percent of respondents claim  familiarity
with safety and performance standards, survey results indicate
that respondents are minimally familiar with quality,
environmental management, national, and international standards.
For example, 71 percent acknowledge their unfamiliarity with
international standards.

7. U.S. firms which intend to market their products and services
in Canada will learn more by contacting SCC or any of the
accredited standards development organizations in Canada. U.S.
firms may also decide to familiarize themselves with the Canadian
market through the help of the Commercial Service (CS) of the
U.S. Department of Commerce which operates offices across Canada.
The Gold Key Service, for example, is one of CS's many services
which offers a cost-effective and efficient way of initiating
business contacts in Canada. This customized business service
allows U.S. firms to develop an understanding of the Canadian
consumers market by having CS trade specialists in Canada arrange
pre-screened appointments and make potentially lucrative contacts
for company representatives.  The Gold key Service is offered in
Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Halifax.

 MOBILE TELECOM SERVICE EXPANDS
 FRANCE TELECOM'S MOBILE ACCOUNTS ARE IN THE RED

1.  FRANCE TELECOM'S MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES HAVE LOST
MORE THAN FF5 BILLION (USD 1 BILLION).  THIS IS PARTICULARLY
SURPRISING SINCE MOST PRIVATE MOBILE PHONE OPERATORS IN EUROPE
HAVE BEEN PROFITABLE.

2.  IN 1994, FRANCE TELECOM MOBILES RADIO TELEPHONE AND FRANCE
TELECOM MOBILES POINTEL LOST FF870 MILLION AND FF215 MILLION,
RESPECTIVELY.  THIS IS A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT COMPARED TO 1993,
WHERE FIGURES SHOWED A TOTAL LOSS OF FF1.36 BILLION.  THE RADIO
TELEPHONE UNIT COMPRISES RADIOCOM 2000 AND ITINERIS, THE
OPERATOR'S ANALOG AND DIGITAL CELLULAR NETWORKS; POINTEL'S ONLY
BUSINESS IS THE BI-BOP TELEPOINT SYSTEM.  IN 1994, THE REVENUE IN
RADIO TELEPHONE AMOUNTED TO FF3.80 BILLION, WHILE THAT OF BI-BOP
TO FF120 MILLION.


3.  FRANCE TELECOM WAS CRITICIZED FOR NOT CREATING TWO SEPARATE
SUBSIDIARIES FOR ITS MOBILE ACTIVITIES.  THE COUR DES COMPTES,
THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT BODY THAT MONITORS THE FINANCIAL
PERFORMANCE OF STATE-OWNED COMPANIES REPORTED THAT FRANCE TELECOM
HAS NOT MET THE TWO CRITERIA ESTABLISHED FOR MOBILE OPERATORS BY
FRENCH REGULATORS - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY, AND
FAIR COMPETITION BETWEEN COMPETITORS.  FURTHERMORE, THE REPORT
SHOWED THAT PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBTS ARE UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSE
THE SAME RATIOS USED FOR FIXED NETWORK CUSTOMERS ARE USED FOR
MOBILE, A SECTOR WITH LESS CUSTOMER FIDELITY.

4.  FOR THE TIME BEING, FRANCE TELECOM RADIO TELEPHONE UNIT HAS
NO ALTERNATIVE THAN TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE RADIOCOM 2000
BUSINESS UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY DECREASES BY ATTRITION AND CLOSES
DOWN.  WITH THE INCREASE IN COMPETITION AND A DESIRE TO SIGN UP
SUBSCRIBERS 'AT ALL COSTS', ADVERTISING EXPENSES (WHICH
REPRESENTED 11 PERCENT OF RADIO TELEPHONE'S REVENUE AND 150
PERCENT OF POINTEL'S IN 1993) WILL CONTINUE TO GROW.  THEREFORE,
FRANCE TELECOM'S FORECAST THAT THE MOBILE BUSINESS WILL BREAK
EVEN IN 1996 OR 1997 MAY BE UNREALISTIC.

5.  DESPITE THIS SITUATION, THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF FRANCE
TELECOM'S MOBILE OPERATIONS ASSERTS THAT THE RADIO TELEPHONE UNIT
WILL BREAK EVEN NEXT YEAR WHILE THE BI-BOP WILL NEVER BE
PROFITABLE.  HOWEVER, FRANCE TELECOM CONTINUES TO PROMOTE BI-BOP
BECAUSE IT HOPES TO MIGRATE MANY TELEPOINT USERS TO THE MORE
EXPENSIVE CELLULAR SERVICES.

6.  FORMER FRANCE TELECOM PRESIDENT, MARCEL ROULET, BLAMED
EQUIPMENT VENDORS FOR THE OPERATOR'S FAILURE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT
MEET THE DEADLINES SET FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INSTALLATION.

7.  THE PENETRATION RATE OF RADIOTELEPHONE IN EUROPE, AS OF
AUGUST 31, 1995:  FRANCE: 1,86%, BELGIUM 1,89%, SPAIN 1,81%,
PORTUGAL 2,50%, NETHERLANDS 2,87%, GERMANY 3,97%, GREECE 2,38%,
ITALY 5,60%, SWITZERLAND 5,94%, UNITED KINGDOM 8,18%, DENMARK
11,45%, FINLAND 17,66%, SWEDEN 21,44%, NORWAY 22,19% .

 CALCUTTA PORT PROFILE
IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF CALCUTTA AND HALDIA
PORTS, WEST BENGAL

1.  SUMMARY.  OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS, CARGO HANDLED
BY THE PORTS AT CALCUTTA AND HALDIA (BOTH RIVER PORTS TO
THE BAY OF BENGAL) HAS INCREASED BY ALMOST 35 PERCENT.
THE NUMBER OF CONTAINER LINES CALLING AT CALCUTTA HAS
GONE UP FROM 20 IN 1988 TO 69 AT PRESENT AND THE NUMBER
OF CONTAINERS HANDLED HAS INCREASED 120 PERCENT.  THE
COMMISSIONING OF THREE NEW CONTAINER FREIGHT STATIONS AT
CALCUTTA PORT HAS REDUCED CONGESTION AND CONTAINER
HANDLING CHARGES.  LABOR RELATIONS THAT WERE EXTREMELY
TURBULENT DURING THE 1980'S, RESULTING IN FREQUENT
STRIKES, NOW ARE COOPERATIVE.  THE AVERAGE PRE-BERTHING
DETENTION OF SHIPS AT CALCUTTA IS LESS THAN A DAY, ONE
OF THE LOWEST AMONG INDIAN PORTS.  PORT FACILITIES ARE
BEING PRIVATIZED, AND PORT AUTHORITIES ARE SEEKING
PRIVATE INVESTMENT TO AUGMENT FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.
WITH INCREASING INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY IN EASTERN INDIA,
CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS ARE LIKELY TO HANDLE 30
MILLION TONS OF CARGO BY THE YEAR 2000.  END SUMMARY

2.  BACKGROUND.  CALCUTTA, INDIA'S OLDEST MAJOR PORT
(AND ONE OF TWO RIVERINE ONES), IS CURRENTLY CELEBRATING
ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY.  OVER THE YEARS THE DRAUGHT OF
THE PORT HAS DECLINED DUE TO SILTATION OF THE HOOGLY
RIVER (A BRANCH OF THE GANGES), AND LARGE SHIPS ARE
UNABLE TO REACH CALCUTTA.  HOWEVER, THE ADVENT OF
"FEEDER" VESSELS HAS BEEN A BOON, AND BOTH CONTAINERIZED
AND OTHER CARGO HANDLED BY CALCUTTA HAS INCREASED
CONSTANTLY OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.  TO OVERCOME THE
PROBLEMS OF LOW DRAUGHT AT CALCUTTA, IN 1977 A NEW PORT
WAS COMMISSIONED AT HALDIA, 83 KM. DOWNSTREAM FROM
CALCUTTA.  THE CALCUTTA PORT TRUST (CPT), A PARASTATAL
UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, ADMINISTERS BOTH THE
CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS.

3.  CALCUTTA PORT.  CARGO HANDLED BY CALCUTTA PORT
INCREASED FROM 4.34 MILLION TONS IN IFY (APRIL 1 THRU
MARCH 31) 1988-89 TO OVER 5.17 MILLION TONS IN IFY
1993-94.  THE HANDLING OF CONTAINERIZED CARGO HAS
INCREASED EVEN MORE RAPIDLY.  AT PRESENT AN AVERAGE 70
PERCENT OF CARGO IS CONTAINERIZED, COMPARED WITH THE
ALL-INDIA AVERAGE OF 35 PERCENT.  THE NUMBER OF
CONTAINERS HANDLED BY CALCUTTA INCREASED BY OVER 120
PERCENT, FROM 50,815 TWENTY-FOOT EQUIVALENT UNITS (TEUS)
IN IFY 1988-89 TO 112,032 IN IFY 1994-95.  CONTAINER
TRAFFIC INCREASED BY ALMOST 17 PERCENT, FROM 96,007 TEUS
IN 1993-94 TO 112,032 TEUS IN IFY 1994-95.  DURING
APRIL-SEPTEMBER 1995, CALCUTTA PORT HANDLED 60,053 TEUS,
AND PORT OFFICIALS EXPECT THAT 130,000 TEUS WILL BE
HANDLED IN 1995-96.

4.  WHILE THE NUMBER OF SHIPS CALLING AT CALCUTTA
DECLINED FROM 840 IN IFY 1988-89 TO 780 IN IFY 1992-93,
THE NUMBER OF CONTAINER LINES OPERATING AT CALCUTTA HAS
INCREASED FROM ABOUT 20 IN 1988-89 TO 69 AT PRESENT.
THE AVERAGE PRE-BERTHING DETENTION OF SHIPS AT CALCUTTA
IS LESS THAN A DAY, ONE OF THE LOWEST AMONG INDIAN PORTS.

5.  IN SEPTEMBER, CALCUTTA PORT COMMISSIONED A NEW, RS.
250 MILLION, COMPUTERIZED CONTAINER FREIGHT STATION
(CFS), WHICH CAN HANDLE 75,000 TEUS ANNUALLY.  WITH
THIS, CONTAINER HANDLING FACILITIES HAVE EXPANDED BY
OVER 20 PERCENT AND CONTAINER HANDLING COSTS HAVE
DECLINED CONSIDERABLY.  OPERATION OF TWO ADDITIONAL
FREIGHT STATIONS (ONE PRIVATELY OWNED AND THE OTHER
OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA) HAS ALSO HELPED TO
REDUCE CONGESTION AT THE PORT.  AN OFFICIAL OF THE
AMERICAN PRESIDENT LINE TOLD US THAT OVER THE PAST
COUPLE OF YEARS, EFFICIENCY AT CALCUTTA PORT HAS
IMPROVED.  HE COMPLAINED, HOWEVER, ABOUT INADEQUATE AND
POORLY MAINTAINED PORT EQUIPMENT THAT OFTEN RESULTS IN
DELAYS.

6.  LABOR.  THE WORKFORCE AT CALCUTTA AND HALDIA PORTS
HAS DECLINED FROM 26,000 IN 1990 TO 21,000 AT PRESENT
(16,000 AT CALCUTTA AND 5000 AT HALDIA).  IT IS
ESTIMATED THAT THIS LABOR FORCE STILL CONTAINS SOME
11,000 UNNECESSARY WORKERS.  AS NATURAL ATTRITION
ACCOUNTS FOR THE LOSS OF 1500 WORKERS ANNUALLY, THE
SURPLUS IS COULD BE ELIMINATED BY THE YEAR 2002.
TRADITIONALLY, CALCUTTA PORT WAS BEDEVILED BY TURBULENT
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND LONG STRIKES.  FOR THE PAST
SEVERAL YEARS INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS HAVE BEEN CORDIAL AND
PRODUCTIVITY HAS IMPROVED.  HOWEVER, SPORADIC AGITATIONS
BY THE STAFFS OF CLEARING AGENTS, STEVEDORES,
TRANSPORTERS AND CONTRACTORS CONTINUE TO HAMPER PORT
OPERATIONS AT CALCUTTA.
7.  HALDIA.  HALDIA'S FORTE IS THE HANDLING OF CRUDE,
OIL AND LUBRICANTS (POL), PETROLEUM DISTILLATES, AND
BULK CARGO, INCLUDING FERTILIZERS AND COAL.  PRE-
BERTHING DETENTION AT HALDIA IS ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE
COUNTRY.  CARGO HANDLED BY HALDIA INCREASED FROM 9.88
MILLION TONS IN IFY 1988-89 TO 13.29 MILLION TONS
(INCLUDING 7.69 MILLION TONS OF CRUDE AND POL) IN IFY
1994-95.  ALTHOUGH CONTAINER HANDLING IS CHEAPER AT
HALDIA THAN CALCUTTA, THE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS HANDLED
AT THE FORMER DURING THIS PERIOD DECREASED FROM 15,901
TO 5,745.

8.  NEW FACILITIES AT HALDIA.  A NEW BULK LIQUID
TERMINAL IS PLANNED AT HALDIA TO AUGMENT FACILITIES TO
COPE WITH THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN THE TRAFFIC OF CRUDE,
POL AND NAPTHA.  (NAPTHA WILL BE THE BASIC INPUT OF A
LARGE PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX BEING PLANNED NEARBY.)  WITH
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PIPELINE LINKING THE EXISTING
REFINERIES AT HALDIA AND BARAUNI (IN THE STATE OF
BIHAR), THE CRUDE HANDLED BY HALDIA (3.28 MILLION TONS
IN IFY 1994-95) IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ALMOST ONE
HUNDRED PERCENT IN IFY 1998-99.  TWO MULTIPURPOSE BERTHS
ARE BEING DEVELOPED AND A SECOND "ARM" AT THE DOCK HAS
BEEN EXCAVATED.  ON COMPLETION OF THE NEW FACILITIES,
HALDIA'S CARGO HANDLING CAPACITY WILL INCREASE TO AN
ESTIMATED 35 MILLION TONS PER YEAR.

10.  SHIP REPAIR YARD AT HALDIA.  A STUDY BY THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK HAS RECOMMENDED THAT A SHIP REPAIR YARD
WITH FACILITIES FOR UNDERWATER HULL REPAIR BE SET UP AT
HALDIA.  (HALDIA, BEING A RIVERINE PORT, HAS THE
ADVANTAGE OF BEING RELATIVELY INSULATED FROM CYCLONES.)
FOLLOWING THIS, THE CPT COMPLETED NEGOTIATIONS FOR A
PRIVATELY-OWNED SHIP REPAIR YARD AT HALDIA.  THE YARD
WILL HAVE TWO DRY DOCKS WITH FACILITIES CAPABLE OF
SERVICING SHIPS UP TO 80,000 DWT AND A LAY-BY WET BERTH
WITH SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE.  SEMBAWANG SHIPYARD OF
SINGAPORE WILL PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.  THE
PROJECT IS AWAITING A GREEN SIGNAL FROM THE CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT.

11.  PRIVATIZATION.  IN RESPONSE TO ECONOMIC REFORM,
CALCUTTA PORT TRUST HAS BEEN PRIVATIZING AGGRESSIVELY.
AT CALCUTTA CPT HAS LEASED OUT TWO DRY DOCKS TO A
PRIVATE, BOMBAY-BASED COMPANY AND TWO BERTHS TO TWO
OTHER PRIVATE COMPANIES.  CPT HAS HANDED OVER
MAINTENANCE OF CONTAINER HANDLING EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING
TRACTOR-TRAILERS AND RUBBER-TIRE-GANTRY CRANES, TO THEIR
MANUFACTURERS.  AT HALDIA, CPT HAS LEASED OUT TWO BERTHS
AND PLANS TO LEASE OUT MORE.

12.  CPT IS KEEN TO CONTRACT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR
CONSTRUCTION OF 15 MORE BERTHS AT HALDIA ON
BUILD-OPERATE-TRANSFER TERMS.  UNFORTUNATELY, WHILE
OFFERS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED FOR THE TAKEOVER OF EXISTING
PORT FACILITIES SUCH AS BERTHS, SHEDS, WAREHOUSES AND
EQUIPMENT, THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED INTEREST IN BUILDING
NEW PORT FACILITIES.

13.  LONG TERM PLANS.  FOR THE PERIOD 1992-97, THE
CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALLOCATED RS. 1.8 BILLION
(APPROXIMATELY USD 51 MILLION) FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
CALCUTTA PORT AND RS. 1.7 BILLION (USD 49 MILLION) FOR
THE DEVELOPMENT OF HALDIA PORT.  THE FUNDS WILL BE USED
TO ACQUIRE CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT, PILOT VESSELS, TUGS
AND RIVER LAUNCHES.  IN ADDITION TO THE TWO
MULTI-PURPOSE BERTHS AT HALDIA AN ADDITIONAL ONE WILL BE
CONSTRUCTED AT CALCUTTA.  AT HALDIA MODERNIZATION OF
COAL HANDLING FACILITIES AND INSTALLATION OF MECHANICAL
LOADERS, CONVEYOR BELTS AND AN EXTENSION OF THE STORAGE
AREA ARE PLANNED.

14.  COMMENT:  IN ADDITION TO THE RS. 3 BILLION (USD 86
MILLION) HALDIA PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX, A REFINERY AND A
POWER PLANT ARE LIKELY TO BE BUILT AT HALDIA.  SEVERAL
PIG IRON AND STEEL PLANTS THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE SET UP
IN WEST BENGAL WILL REQUIRE IMPORTS OF COKING COAL AND
COKE.  THE PIG IRON AND STEEL PRODUCED BY THESE NEW
PLANTS ARE LIKELY TO BE EXPORTED TO CHINA AND SOUTHEAST
ASIA.  INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY IN EASTERN INDIA IS GAINING
MOMENTUM.  DUE TO THESE FACTORS, CALCUTTA AND HALDIA
PORTS ARE EXPECTED TO HANDLE 25 MILLION TONS OF CARGO IN
IFY 1996-97 AND 30 MILLION TONS BY THE TURN OF THE
CENTURY.

 NEW CUSTOMS LAW
 New Customs Law for Indonesia

A new customs law for Indonesia has been enacted which is
expected to take effect on April 1, 1996, after implementing
regulations are issued.

The new law provides for a self-assessment system enforced
through random inspections.  Importers and exporters will provide
the customs office with information on the type, quality,
quantity, and cutoms value of the goods being transported, and
any applicable tariffs or export taxes.  The calculations and
payment of duties will similarly be left to the companies
themselves.  Customs officials and excise officers will carry out
post-clearance audits, checking the veracity of the information
provided.

The new customs law also allows the government to impose
countervailing duties and antidumping tariffs to protect domestic
industry from unfair foreign competition.  It is not yet clear
how these elements of the new law will be applied.

The new law will replace current customs rules based on pre-
shipment rather than on-arrival inspection.

1994:
     Guard services       $460 billion
     Burglar alarms       $110 million
     Fire alarms          $125 million
     Locks                $150 million

At PROTECTION '96, the following products and services will be on
display:

     - Rescue Services
     - Environmental Protection

 RETAIL TRENDS
 Japan -- The Big Store Law leads to Structural
Change in the Retail Sector

1. In Japan, the Big Store Law (Daitenho) has changed the face of
retailing. The law has encouraged a reduction in the numbers of
high cost, privately owned, small retail stores.  In contrast,
there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of low cost,
publicly owned shopping center-type operations.  The process of
modernizing Japan's retail sector, however, is only half
finished.  Expected liberalization of the Daitenho in 1996 and
1997 will further accelerate the transition process.  End Summary

2. Statistics recently compiled by the Japan Development Bank
clearly indicate the inefficiencies of the Japanese distribution
system relative to its U.S. counterpart.

- From 1980 to 1993, the number of people engaged in wholesale
and retail trade in Japan increased only 1.43 million compared to
an increase of 5.05 million in the U.S. during the same period.

- Japan's wholesale/retail share of GDP was reduced from 14.3 to
14.1 percent compared to an increase in the U.S. from 13.5
percent to 16.6 percent, during the same period.

- Japan's wholesale/retail ratio is 2.1/1, compared to 1.1/1 in
the U.S.

- In the U.S., 60 percent of all retail stores were privately
owned in 1972.  This percentage fell to 36 percent by 1988.  In
Japan, 61 percent of total retail stores were privately owned in
1994.

3. According to 1994 MITI statistics, there are 1.59 million
retailers in Japan, of which small retailers with 1 to 4 workers
comprised 1.13 million or 71 percent of the total.  These small
stores have been disappearing at a rate of 47,000 stores per year
since a partial relaxation of the Daitenho in 1990.

4. At the same time, the number of large stores has been
increasing rapidly.  In 1989, before the implementation of the
relaxation of the Daitenho, the number of annual applications for
the establishment of large stores was 794.  In 1990, the number
of applications increased to 1,667.  In 1995, more than 1,900
applications to open large stores have thus far been submitted.

5. Since 1990, partial relaxation of the Daitenho has taken place
three times, as follows:

1990 --   Maximum length of the application processing became 18
          months.  (Implemented through an extended
          interpretation of the law.)

1992 --   Maximum length of application processing became 12
          months.  Adoption of procedural transparency
          (Implemented through partial amendment of the law.)

1994 --   Basic liberalization of stores with floor space less
          than 1,000 square meters.  Relaxation of store hours,
          number of holidays in a year, etc. (Implemented
          through an extended interpretation of the law.)

6. In the not too distant future, we expect incremental reform of
the Daitenho to continue.  Specifically, we expect that the
application process will be simplified.  Moreover, the time
required for approval will fall from the present 9 month period.
In 1997, it is likely that the government will announce further
liberalization of store operating parameters, including floor
space, business hours and number of vacation days.

7. At the same time, one should remember that there are many
forces working against the relaxation of the Big Store Law.  The
following associations have lined up in support of the present
highly restrictive legislation:
a)  Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry
b)  Federation of National Commerce and Industry
c)  Central Organization for National Small/Medium Sized Business
d)  Federation of National Shopping District Promotion
    Association, and
e)  8 other small/medium size business organizations.

Organizations that favor reform or abolition of the law are:
a)  Foreign Governments
b)  Large store corporations
c)  Japan Chain Store Association
d)  Federation of Economic Organization in Yamaguchi Prefecture.

8. Industry sources say that the restrictions of the Daitenho
have led to rapid development of a large number of suburban,
roadside stripmalls.  These stripmalls do not have any large
store tenants.  Rather, they contain a large number of small
retail outlets and therefore do not fall under the purview of the
Daitenho.  At the same time, these stripmalls do not enjoy the
same economies of scale, or low prices, as large shopping centers
with one or more large scale tenants.

9. As of now, while there are as many as 40,000 shopping centers
in the U.S., there are only 2,225 shopping centers with large
scale tenants in Japan.  An industry source estimates that the
number of Japanese shopping centers will increase by 20,000 over
the next ten years.

10. At the same time, there are 15,000 shop-lined streets in
Japan.  Almost all of the outlets along the "shopping streets"
are privately owned and managed as single store outlets.  They
are high cost operations and are the most likely to fall victim
to further liberalization of the Daitenho.  For example,
according to a recent article in "Distribution Service News," 7
of 33 three stores in Kamuma City's shop-lined street are closed.
This case is considered to be typical of many Japanese towns and
small cities.

11. The success of "Toys R Us" has is inspired similar large
scale, single category formats in other segments: electronics,
appliances, tools, men's wear and sporting goods.  The trend is
accelerating as Japanese companies anticipate further relaxation,
and ultimate abolition, of the Daitenho in the near future.

12. The structural shift in the retail industry in Japan is
taking place at a time when the "barriers to entry" for foreign
retailers are much reduced.  Land prices have dropped on the
average by 50 percent and rental is down by 40 percent.  This is
due to record levels of real estate vacancies (15 percent in
major cities).  In addition, companies that wish to build their
own properties will find that construction costs have also
declined up to 40 percent in some cases.  Most importantly, the
low value of the dollar gives companies that source abroad a
competitive advantage over Japanese competitors.  Now is a good
time for foreign retailers to re-consider entry into the Japanese
market.

 WATER QUALITY PLAN

1. SUMMARY: The results of a recent study, "Quality of Water in
Spain: Summary Report", published by the Ministry of Health and
Consumer Affairs, indicate that the quality of Spanish coastal
waters is good, whereas there are still problems with continental
waters, especially in Spain's central regions. The control
network established to measure the quality of water in Spain is
managed by Hydrographic Confederacies, which feed data to the
Ministry in Madrid through an automatic station network. This
network officially began working in March 1995 under the name
SAICA (Sistema Automatico de Informacion de Calidad de las Aguas,
Water Quality Information Automatic Network). This report
provides background information on the SAICA program and a list
of the Hydrographic Confederacies and Spanish firms that supply
equipment or services to SAICA, which is considered one of the
most sophisticated water quality information systems in the
world.

2.  The network established to control and measure the quality of
water in Spain is managed by the Hydrographic Confederacies,
which are independent governmental bodies located throughout the
country with responsibilities for monitoring and managing Spain's
water resources. These Confederacies have implemented a remote
system for measuring the quality of water (automatic stations
network) under the name SAICA (Sistema Automatico de Informacion
de Calidad de las Aguas). These stations can transmit monitored
data via satellite to the headquarters of each Hydrographic
Confederacy and to a central unit located in the Ministry of
Public Works, Transportation and Environment in Madrid. The data
transmitted through this network gives information on turbidity,
ph, carbon and metal content, oxygen content, phosphates and
ammonia. Each Confederacy has its own analytical laboratory, or
has special agreements with officially approved private
laboratories.

3. The SAICA system is considered one of the most sophisticated
systems of its kind in the world, and official Spanish sources
proudly say that it is the only system in the world established
on a country-wide basis. It covers all of the main river basins
in Spain and uses state-of-the-art technology. Total investment
in the SAICA system was Pts 10,000 million (USD 80 million) which
includes installation of 1,000 manual water quality control
stations and 200 automatic control stations. Investment was
partially funded through European Union Cohesion Funds (85% of

 INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS
 New Internet Provider in Indonesia

On November 30, 1995 a new Internet provider was launched. It is
the fifth Internet provider in Indonesia to date.
The provider is called CBNnet, established by P.T. Cyberindo
Aditama in cooperation with YPTI, Foundation of Technical
Education in Indonesia, a foundation under the Department of
Tourism, Post and Telecommunication.
Mr. Dani Sumarsono, president of P.T. Cyberindo Aditama,
informed U.S. Commercial Service Jakarta that Internet business
in Indonesia will grow steadily and competition will be based on
services, tariff rates, reliability and accessibility. Tariff
levels have been set by the government, so that each Internet
provider only has a narrow band within which to compete in price.
CBNnet has a maximum modem speed of 28.8 Kbps for individual
accounts (IP dial up) and 33.6 Kbps for corporate accounts (LAN
dial up). At this stage, its target market is the professionals
in the Jakarta area. With improving infrastructures, CBNnet is
optimist it could get at least 2,000 individual accounts in the
first year of operation. Mr. Sumarsono revealed that there has
already been a big jump in the number of Internet users in
Jakarta. In June this year, there were 8,000 users, but by
September there were 15,000 users. He expects it will take
several more years for the industry to become fully mature.
There are currently four other Internet providers : IndoInternet
(P.T. IndoInternet), Idola (P.T. Aplikanusa Lintasartha), Radnet
(P.T. Rahajasa Media Internet) and IBM Internet Connection (P.T.
Sistelindo Mitralintas).

         CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NEWS

         CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NEWS

1. Summary: Eastern Germany's large chemicals industry, which
accounted for 20 percent of total industrial output for the
nation before reunification, continues to confront the problems
of restructuring its large inefficient chemical concerns,
adapting to new markets, finding buyers, and cleaning up massive
pollution.

2. Background:  in the former GDR (Eastern Germany), 230 chemical
companies, encompassing petrochemicals, plastics, rubber, and
potash mining, were grouped into 14 huge conglomerates.  By 1994
over 200 of these companies had been privatized.  However, the
size of these privatized companies averaged under 300 employees.
The remaining chemicals firms had the overwhelming share of the
total employees in the industry.  The large companies also
suffered from antiquated equipment and continue to operate in the
midst of massive environmental damage. The most publicized
privatization case covered the three chemical production sites in
eastern Germany which Dow Chemical (Midland, Michigan) agreed to
buy in November.  This is the Buna Sow Leuna (BSL) conglomerate.

3. Interim Market Dynamics:  the output trend for inorganic and
organic chemicals clearly reflects changes in the eastern German
chemicals market.  The primary change is aimed at reducing
lignite processing and building up a petrochemicals base.  Since
the middle of 1990 over 150 antiquated production facilities in
the chemical industry have been shut down in eastern Germany.  In
Leuna, plants for ammonia, methanol high-pressure, and phenol
synthesis were shut down, and in the Buna facility, carbide-
acetylene production.  Until production of basic chemicals can be
restarted on a petrochemical basis, organic chemicals for further
processing are purchased from elsewhere.

4. Environmental Consequences: environmental cleanup is a high
priority for the Germans, accounting for one-third of total
investments in the eastern German chemicals industry.  The
Treuhand (federal privatization agency) originally provided Buna
with DM 300 million for the construction of an oxychlorinating
plant for pvc production and for an air separation plant.  For
Leuna the Treuhand provided DM 250 million for a hydrogen
production plant, a refinery water cleaning plant, a
desulphurization plant, and a tanker filling station.  For many
chemical companies, funds are being provided for disposing of
polluted waste dumps.

5. Dow Chemical: In November, 1995 the European Commission
reached a final decision to approve the privatization of the Buna
Sow Leuna (BSL) Olefin chemicals conglomerate in the eastern
German state of Saxony-Anhalt. To that end the EC Commission has
decided to allow up to 5.5 billion dollars of investment
subsidies to support the privatisation plan laid out by Dow
Chemical. Dow will own 80 percent of the BSL conglomerate with
the remaining 20 percent owned by BVS (the successor agency to
the Treuhand).  So far, ten companies have signed letters of
intent to join Dow at BSL, including the American plastics
molder, Ampacet Corp., Spanish-owned Grupo Coexpan, the Belgian
Ravago, Italy's ILPA, Manuli Group and Deribok.

6. Modernisation: Dow has plans to upgrade a number of existing
facilities.  The existing chlorine plant will be upgraded from
the current mercury-based process to a membrane process,
eliminating the use of mercury in these plants.  The ethylene
dichloride (EDC)  and vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) plant at Buna
will be upgraded along with an increase of VCM capacity to
330,000 tons per year.  The existing rubber production facilities
will be retrofitted and upgraded.  The low-density polyethylene
plants at the Leuna site will be upgraded to increase plant
safety.  And a general upgrade of the process instrumentation and
control systems is planned.  The Boehlen steam cracker which
produces the main building blocks for derivative plants at all
three sites will be upgraded and expanded to make the cracker
globally cost-competitive in technology and feedstock
flexibility.  Total capacity by the end of 1997 will be 450,000
tons per year.  The upgrade will include plant modifications such
as four new cracking furnaces, on-stream analyzers and
computerized process control.

7. New Equipment: new facilities are also planned.  A 210,000
ton-per-year plant for the production of DOWLEX(r) linear low-
density polyethylene at the Buna site will come on stream in late
1997, in coordination with the expanded production of the steam
cracker at Boehlen.  A 200,000 ton-per-year polypropylene plant
will be built at the Buna site and will come on stream during the
second quarter of 1998.  A 130,000 ton-per-year aniline plant
will come on stream in late 1998.  A 90,000 ton-per-year acrylic
acid and a 93,000 ton-per-year acrylic ester unit will be built
to obtain viable economics through scale and technology.  Several
facilities for the compounding and recycling of polymers will be
added to the Buna site.

8. Feedstock Pipeline: a new pipeline is also planned.  A 16-inch
multi-feedstock liquid pipeline from the deep-sea port of Rostock
to the Boehlen site has already been started by the Saechsische
Olefinwerke GmbH.  Planning and construction of this pipeline
will include the construction of required facilities such as
harbor facilities, terminals and pump stations.

9. Chemicals Industry Supplier Mission:  FCS Berlin is planning
for the Spring of 1996 a trade mission to eastern Germany, which
will include a stop at the Buna Sow Leuna facilities.  Those U.S.
firms that can benefit from new contacts in the chemicals
industry in eastern Germany are encouraged to participate.  The
mission will be coordinated with German authorities to insure
that the best contacts are made for the U.S. participants.  For
follow-up information and costs on the trade mission, contact:

2.  LOCAL PRODUCTION: LOCAL PRODUCTION HAS MET OVER 95%
OF THE DEMAND UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO.  THE DEMAND WAS FOR
LOW QUALITY LOW PRICED BICYCLES.  LOCAL PRODUCTION
ADAPTED ITSELF TO THIS MARKET TREND FOR A LONG TIME.  THE
TREND HAS CHANGED ONLY RECENTLY WHEN IMPORTERS CAME INTO
THE PICTURE.  IMPORTS OF DIVERSE RANGE AND QUALITY OF
BICYCLES WHICH STARTED TO DRIVE THE MARKET, PROMPTED THE
LOCAL MANUFACTURERS TO FOLLOW SUIT.  SOME OF THEM SIGNED
LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH LEADING BRANDS, WHILE OTHERS
DIRECTED THEMSELVES TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY.  IN 1995,
LOCAL PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO REACH 900,000 UNITS AND
$175 MILLION.  LOCAL BISAN TAKES 50% SHARE FROM THE
MARKET. MARKET SHARE FOR OTHER COMPETITORS ARE BELDESAN
(25%), BIANCHI(25%), AND OZBELGE(10%).  BICYCLE PRICES
VARY BETWEEN $250-400 FOR STANDARD BICYCLES, WHERE THEY
CAN BE AS HIGH AS $2,500 FOR SPECIAL ONES.

3.  IMPORTS: BICYCLE IMPORTS DECREASED TO 58,487 UNITS
($2.8 MILLION) IN 1994 FROM 1993'S FIGURE OF 100,258
($5.2 MILLION) DUE TO A MAJOR ECONOMIC CRISIS IN TURKEY.
TAIWAN AND PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC) TAKE THE
LION'S SHARE OF THE IMPORT MARKET.  BREAKDOWN OF IMPORTS
ACCORDING TO COUNTRIES IS AS FOLLOWS:

               1993                     1994
COUNTRY   QUANTITY  VALUE          QUANTITY  VALUE

TAIWAN    70,880    3,744,078      38,718    2,014,312
PRC       15,151      986,070      14,169      355,936
ITALY      1,514      141,182       4,865      353,061
U.S.          20        8,050         172       32,313
TOTAL    100,258    5,249,994      58,487    2,785,329

DESPITE THE DECREASE IN THE OVERALL BICYCLE IMPORTS IN
1994, IT IS OBSERVED THAT IMPORT FIGURES HAVE GROWN FOR
ITALY AND U.S.  ALTHOUGH RESPECTIVE QUANTITIES ARE QUITE
LOWER THAN THE FIRST TWO COUNTRIES, IMPORT VALUE PER
BICYCLE IS MUCH HIGHER.  THESE FIGURES IMPLY THAT THE
U.S. EXPORTERS SHOULD AIM FOR THE HIGH-END OF THE MARKET
DRIVEN BY HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND QUALITY.  MOUNTAIN BIKES,
FOR EXAMPLE, CONSTITUTE A GOOD MARKET FOR U.S. SUPPLIERS.

IMPORT TAX IS 3.8% FOR EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES AND 17%
FOR OTHERS.  IT WILL BE ZEROED FOR EU COUNTRIES WITH THE
CUSTOMS UNION WHICH WILL START IN 1996.  SOME DECREASE IS
EXPECTED FOR OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL.

4.  EXPORTS: BICYCLE EXPORTS FROM TURKEY OVER THE LAST
TWO YEARS WERE AS FOLLOWS:

1993: 36,497 UNITS ($2.4 MILLION)

1994: 82,628 UNITS ($4.8 MILLION)

MAJOR EXPORT MARKETS IN 1994 WERE: ITALY: 19,405,
GERMANY: 17,056, CZECH REPUBLIC: 11,990, POLAND: 7,676,
GREECE: 6,525.
