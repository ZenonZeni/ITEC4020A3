<H3>&#163;2 billion-plus trade surplus makes medicines Britain's
second-biggest export earner</CENTER></H3>

<P>
Britain's pharmaceutical industry earned well over &#163;2 billion
for the nation last year, putting it second only to the oil industry
as a net contributor to the UK economy, according to final figures
published on 2 May by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical
Industry (ABPI).
<P>
With pharmaceutical exports standing at nearly &#163;5 billion,
the positive balance of trade in medicines was &#163;2,133 million
- 25 per cent higher than the previous year, when it stood at
&#163;1,700 million. The figures push pharmaceuticals above power-generating
machinery into second place as a top earner for Britain.
<P>
The figures show that exports of pharmaceuticals in 1995 were
worth &#163;4,935 million, compared with &#163;4,004 million the
previous year, while imports stood at &#163;2,802 million (&#163;2,304
million in 1994).
<P>
The results support the recent prediction by the Secretary of
State for Health, Mr Stephen Dorrell, that pharmaceuticals will
be as important for Britain in the next century as they have been
in recent years.
<P>
&quot;These figures reflect the strength of the British-based
pharmaceutical industry,&quot; said Dr Trevor Jones, Director-General
of the ABPI. &quot;They show the enormous contribution it makes
towards the wealth - as well as the health - of the nation when
given the scope to develop the long-term strategies essential
in a research-based industry. The benefit to Britain's economy
in jobs, foreign earnings and tax revenues is also worth &#163;2
billion a year.
<P>
&quot;Nevertheless, despite the undoubted success reflected in
the balance of trade surplus, imports of medicines are growing
almost as fast as exports. While there are clearly pressures on
funding healthcare in the UK, it is vital that any Government,
of whatever persuasion, continues to provide a stable environment
which looks to the long-term future of the industry.&quot;
<P>
Two of the biggest increases in the pharmaceutical balance of
trade surplus are to European Union countries and to the USA.
Exports to the EU rose to &#163;2,592 million in 1995 - a jump
of 38 per cent on 1994 when they were &#163;1,883 million - giving
a trade surplus of &#163;553 million, up 33 per cent from &#163;418
million. There was a 57 per cent jump in the trade surplus with
the USA, with the 1994 figure of &#163;212 million increasing
to &#163;333 million in 1995. This was due to a 46 per cent rise
in exports (&#163;619 million in 1995 from &#163;426 million in
1994).
<P>
Of other countries, the most dramatic rise is in the trade surplus
with Australia, where it more than doubled from 1994's &#163;57
million to reach &#163;117 million in 1995. This was largely due
to a 68 per cent rise in exports.
