<h1 align=center>Statement by Judge James P. Gray,
<br>Orange County Superior Court </h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>To Republicans for Proposition 215:</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Thank you for your work on the important Medical Marijuana
Initiative. I regretfully must decline to take an active role in this campaign
because I do not believe that an active judge should be involved even in
quasi political matters. However, I certainly will vote for your initiative,
and recommend that others do the same. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>If it will help, you may certainly use the following quote
from me as a part of your efforts: </font></p>

<dd><font SIZE=+1>It is a crime not to allow a medical doctor to be able
to prescribe appropriate medicine to a patient who is suffering from a
disease or who is in pain. For those people who at this time do not agree
with that statement, maybe it would help for them to ask themselves the
following question: &quot;If you had a loved one who was nauseous from
dosages of chemotherapy, or who had a loss of appetite form AIDS, or who
suffered from glaucoma, would you rather that his or her medication was
prescribed by a medical doctor or by a policeman?&quot; I believe this
to be an easy question to answer. </font></dd>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Again, I wish you the best of fortune as you pursue the
passage of this initiative, and if I may be of further assistance, please
feel free to call on me. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Very truly yours, </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>James P. Gray </font></p>
