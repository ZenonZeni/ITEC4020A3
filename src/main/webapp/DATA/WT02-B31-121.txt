<STRONG>Good Property to Own</STRONG><P>




When building for your family's financial future, a permanent life insurance
policy
can
provide a solid
foundation. Living the "American Dream" has been a goal for generations. The
loving
family,
the
beautiful home ... this is the stuff dreams are made of. But protecting your
dreams
and
caring for loved
ones goes back a lot further than the "American Dream" - those intentions
are
probably as
old
as
mankind itself. Providing for your family's financial well-being means
putting
together a
comprehensive
program that will take care of today's needs, as well as plan for tomorrow.
This
customized
plan might
include a mix of bank accounts, health insurance, life insurance, annuities,
mutual
funds,
and an IRA.
When considering the need for life insurance, it's wise to take a close look
at the
advantages of
permanent life insurance. This type of policy not only offers financial
protection
to
survivors but can also
benefit a family during the insured's lifetime.
<P>
<STRONG>Why Permanent Life Insurance is Unique</STRONG><BR>
Whole life is the traditional form of permanent life insurance. It is just
that -
permanent -
you're
insured for your entire life, provided, of course, that you continue to pay
premiums. Your
coverage can
never be canceled, and the premiums are fixed - they can never be increased.
It is
also a
feature-rich,
customizable plan that can be tailored to suit you and your family's needs.
<P>
<STRONG>How Permanent Life Insurance Helps Beneficiaries</STRONG><BR>
To many, the primary reason for having life insurance is to protect their
family's
financial
future. Should
the insured die, life insurance helps pay off mortgages, fund college
educations,
take care
of final
expenses, offset the loss of the insured's income and allows a family to
continue
its
standard of living.
In most cases, insurance proceeds pass to beneficiaries free of probate
costs,
legal fees,
local
inheritance tax, and federal income tax. To the extent permitted by state
law,
insurance
benefits are
protected from claims of the insured's creditors. Benefits are generally
paid
promptly to
beneficiaries
through a convenient, interest earning, no-fee checking account. Or if you
prefer,
you can
designate a
payment method in advance, choosing from a variety of settlement options
that offer
periodic
payments
until the proceeds are paid in full. Not only does permanent life insurance
offer a
guaranteed payment
to beneficiaries at the death of the insured, but it also provides important
benefits during
your lifetime.
<P>
<STRONG>Benefits of Permanent Life Insurance During Your
Lifetime</STRONG><BR>
Unlike term life insurance, permanent life insurance is a value builder.
Both
guaranteed
values and
non-guaranteed values build up, tax deferred, over the years, and you can
put them
to work
for you in a
number of ways.
<P>
<STRONG>Accumulation of cash values</STRONG> - A permanent life insurance
policy
builds
guaranteed cash value as you
pay your premiums when due. These values are further enhanced since taxes on
the
money's
growth
are deferred. This cash value can be accessed through a valuable loan
provision.
<P>
<STRONG>Tapping into your cash values</STRONG> - You can borrow from your
policy's
accumulated
cash value by taking a
loan at competitive interest rates. You can use these funds any way you wish
- make
a down
payment
on a home, finance a new car, or even start a business (the J.C. Penney and
Disney
empires
were
started with loans from life insurance policies). The loan privilege is a
valuable
feature of
permanent life
insurance, but keep in mind that borrowing against your policy's value
reduces your
insurance
protection. In addition, any time you take money out of an insurance policy,
you
may be
subject to state
and federal taxes. It may be advisable to borrow only with the intention of
repaying your
loan in full.
Insurance companies offer several convenient repayment methods to restore
your
policy's
full
value.
<P>
<STRONG>Eligible for dividends</STRONG> - As "participating" insurance, a
permanent
policy is
eligible for dividends if and
when the company declares them. Each year, insurers determine how much
income
needs
to be
retained to build surplus. The remaining balance, if any, is returned to
policyowners in the
form of
dividends. As they are considered returned premiums, dividends are not
taxable.
You
can
use
your
dividends in a number of ways. Options include: leaving them on deposit with
the 
insurance
company
to earn interest; using them to purchase additional insurance coverage;
applying
them to
pay
all or part
of your premium; or taking them as cash. Unlike cash value, dividends are
not
guaranteed.
<P>
<STRONG>The Flexibility of Permanent Life Insurance</STRONG><BR>
As needs change, a permanent policy can be modified to reflect those
changes.
Most
insurance
companies make a wide range of optional benefits and riders available that
you may
add to
your policy
to enhance your existing coverage, extend coverage to family members, and
help
out
in
difficult times.
Additional underwriting may be required to add benefits or riders.
<P>
<STRONG>Enhancing your coverage</STRONG> - Along with the additional
coverage
available
through
dividend options, you
can increase your protection by adding a low-cost term insurance rider to
your
policy. An
accidental
death benefit provision can also be added, which doubles the insurance
proceeds if
the
insured dies
as a result of an accident. With an OPP (Option to Purchase Paid-up
additions)
rider, you
may
add,
within limits, extra money to your policy to provide additional death
benefits and
increase
cash value on
a tax-deferred basis.
<P>
<STRONG>Extending coverage to family members</STRONG> - You may add a
spouse
and children's
insurance rider to
protect those loved ones with term insurance. With a children's insurance
rider,
they will be
covered
with term insurance, and be guaranteed the right to purchase permanent life
insurance, in
specified
amounts at specified times, as they grow up.
<P>

<STRONG>Help in difficult times</STRONG> - With a waiver of premium rider,
premiums
are paid
by
the company during a
period of disability, as defined in the rider. Cash value, dividends, and
death
benefit grow
as if you were
still paying premiums. An automatic premium loan feature prevents your
policy from
lapsing
should you
miss a premium payment. If cash value is sufficient, it uses those values to
pay
the premium.
New York
Life now offers a living benefits rider, which pays a benefit should the
insured
become
terminally ill.
New York Life also pioneered the unemployment rider<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>. This provision waives one annual premium
should the policyowner become unemployed for a predetermined period of time.
<P>

<STRONG>Build Your House on a Sound Foundation</STRONG><BR>
When evaluating your family's financial needs, it's important not to
overlook life
insurance.
A permanent
life insurance policy is a unique, highly flexible financial product that
can
provide peace
of mind, as well
as help you meet important needs during your lifetime. It can be the sound
foundation upon
which you
build your financial house. In fact, it may actually help you purchase a
real
house! A life
insurance policy
can be used as collateral for a loan or mortgage. It can also help establish
a good
credit
rating. In
addition, accumulated cash values can be borrowed to make a down payment on
that
dream
home.<P>
