</H3>
What if a tiny but stubborn group of people continue to promote legalization
of now- illegal drugs? We cannot afford to permit these few misguided people,
some possibly with ulterior motives, to succeed. There is a need for factual
information to counter the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) and others who would
create a nation of zombies and destroy America. <BR>
<BR>
This nation's most precious resource is our children, the future generation.
Our legacy to them must be a society that gives them the best possible chance
to live useful, healthy lives in safe communities that are free of crime
and drugs. <BR>
<BR>
What if ... we left our children in communities with even more crime and
violence than there is now? Drug-related crime generates much of the increasing
violence in our schools and neighborhoods. <BR>
<BR>
What if ... more drugs were legalized? What kinds of communities would we
leave? <BR>
<BR>
What if ... the legalizers succeed? <BR>
<BR>
Who loses? 
<UL>
  <LI>Our children 
  <LI>Families 
  <LI>Neighborhoods 
  <LI>Communities 
  <LI>All of us!! 
</UL>
Who gains? 
<UL>
  <LI>Drug producers 
  <LI>Drug sellers 
  <LI>Criminals 
  <LI>Addicts 
  <LI>Money launderers 
</UL>
All of us need to take a stand, to do something before we lose even more
of our children to drugs and violence. <BR>
