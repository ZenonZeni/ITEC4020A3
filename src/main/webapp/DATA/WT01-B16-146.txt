SCARAs (TM-SCARA)</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Sankyo Robotics</b></font> has
unveiled an exciting extension to its SCARA product line called
the <i>TM-SCARA</i>, which stands for Track-Mounted SCARA. The
TM-SCARA is comprised of a Sankyo SR8437 or SR8438 SCARA and a
servo-controlled track, measuring from 1 meter to 10 meters in
length. The track-axis incorporates either a ball-screw or rack
&amp;&nbsp;pinion drive. Speeds of the track-axis are dependent
on the length and type of drive used, however up to 1000 mm/sec
is achievable. The effective workspace of a stationary SCARA is
dramatically increased, allowing the precise, 4-axis robot to be
applied to even more tasks to increase its utilization. The
TM-SCARAs are also available for Class 10 cleanroom environments
and prove very useful in the disk-drive industry, to move
cassettes of disks between processes, or in the medical industry,
to handle materials or samples from process to process. Some
customization is also possible to accommodate height and length
requirements. </p>

<p>The TM-SCARA is controlled by the Sankyo SC3200 controller,
which is a higher capacity version of the SC3000 controller. The
SC3200, in a slightly bigger package, has the power and
amplifiers to control from 5 to 8 axes. It also features the
exciting-to-use Touch Screen Pendant for point teaching,
application control, and for system monitoring.</p>
