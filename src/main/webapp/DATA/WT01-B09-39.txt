<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Strengthening the Economy with Clean
Technologies</FONT></h3>
<p>

The Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC)
is a non&#173;profit association of private/public companies and
agencies working together to promote the advance of alternative
fuel vehicle (AFV) technologies in the Northeast United States.
<P>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>The NAVC Mission</FONT></h3>

<P>

NAVC's mission is to:</FONT>
<P><ul>
<li> Strengthen the Northeast economy by supporting
the creation of highly skilled technology jobs in the region;
</FONT>
<P>
<li> Increase the use of clean&#173;fueled vehicle technology within
the Northeast corridor to help reduce this region's serious air
quality problems; </FONT>
<P>
<li> Expand energy fuel and transportation planning possibilities by
the use of alternative fuel vehicles.<p></ul>

In partnership with the Advanced Research Projects
Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense, NAVC has enabled
over $29 million of alternative fuel vehicle projects to begin
in the Northeast in the last two years alone. The Northeast is
a natural region for EV/hybrid development. With its traditionally
large defense&#173;oriented sector, its network of universities
and high technology firms, and its air quality problems, the Northeast
has many reasons to move forward through NAVC to develop EV/hybrid
technology projects. These ARPA programs provide economic development,
technology advances and new opportunities for the region.<BR>

<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Accomplishments</FONT></h3>
<P>
NAVC recently finalized its second major grant agreement
with the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). This program
94&#173;24, in combination with the current NAVC 93&#173;23 program,
provides a total of over <B>$29 million in advanced vehicle technology
development projects to the Northeast.</B> The current four&#173;phase
93&#173;23 program includes:
<P><ul>
<li> <b>Part 1:  Vehicle demonstrations </FONT></B>, (pickup
trucks, buses, utility vans and passenger vehicles) and infrastructure
implementation (electric recharge and a natural gas refueling
station) at a military site: Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford,
MA.</FONT>
<P>
<li> <B>Part 2: Civilian Pilot Projects</B>, testing various vehicles and performing
criteria, in each of the six New England states and New York City.</FONT>
<P>
<li> <b>Part 3: Technology development projects,</FONT></B> including lightweight
composite vehicles, development of an AC drive system and a hybrid
electric lightweight composite bus.</FONT>
<P>
<li> <b>Part 4: Educational and informational activities</FONT></B> designed to share developments with other regions, industry, and
the general public.</FONT>
<P></ul>

The 94&#173;24 technology development projects include:
<P><ul>

<li> <B>Design and testing of a lightweight composite electric vehicle
</B>for broad manufacturing capability;</FONT>
<P>
<li> Development of a low&#173;cost, effective modeling program for
design and testing of composite body components to meet<B> </B>safety
standards;</FONT>
<P>
<li> >Upgrading <B>flywheel </B>motor size<B>
</B>for bus and heavy&#173;duty vehicle applications;</FONT>
<P>
<li> Providing and testing<B> thermal management </B>for electric vehicles<B>
</B>suitable for cold (and hot) weather climates;</FONT>
<P>
<li> Development and testing<B> EV supercapacitors</B>;

<p><li> Conducting design testing on <B>hybrid variable motors</B> and
several projects involving motor controllers.</FONT>
<P></ul>
These dual&#173;use programs retain both civilian
and military applicability. Components of particular interest
to the military include:</FONT>
<P><ul>
<li> UTC's flywheel;</FONT>
<P>
<li> Kaman's hybrid motor;</FONT>
<P>
<li> Federal Fabric's supercapacitor.</FONT>
<P></ul>
NAVC also participated in the unveiling of the <B>Solectria
Sunrise </B>in December,<I> </I>a lightweight pure electric sedan
designed to meet all zero-emission vehicle and Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standards.</FONT>
<P>
Highly positive results of recent winter driving
tests in the Boston area in which <B>advanced thermal management
technologies </B>proved successful in enabling cold weather EV
operation without significant decrease in performance.<BR>

military and commercial applications.</i></b></blockquote><br clear = all><BR>

<P>


<h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Future Directions</FONT></h3>
<P>
A major market focus of NAVC will be heavy-duty vehicles.
Last December NAVC established its Northeast Clean Bus Committee.
NAVC plans to explore, with bus suppliers, transit authorities,
utilities and others, the opportunities for greater clean fuel
bus operations. This market is also of great interest to the military
because of similar powertrain requirements.</FONT>
<P>
Finally, NAVC is working to expand its links with business partners
in the region on infrastructure development and other market issues.
The ARPA technology programs are providing the foundation for
this emerging dual-use market.<p>
