<p align="center"><b>Jury Rules That Hemp Seed Demonstration Is A
Protest, Not Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>August 24, 1995, Madera, CA:</b>&nbsp; A jury
has acquitted three marijuana activists who challenged
authorities to prosecute them for publicly planting 20,000 hemp
seeds in me Sierra foothills.&nbsp; Hemp proponents Ron
Kiczenski, Doug Weissman, and Craig Steffens were all found not
guilty of felony cultivation.&nbsp; The trio, collectively known
as the Three Hawk Stand, were arrested by sheriffs deputies
following a July 4 public protest during which the defendants
planted hemp seeds in front of both media and local
authorities.&nbsp; Had they been found guilty, the three activists
each faced up to three years in jail and a $10,000 fine. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The men were found innocent in spite of the court's efforts to
disallow the defense from presenting evidence that hemp can be
utilized as an industrial crop and that the defendants' action was
done strictly as a political protest.&nbsp; Earlier in the trial,
Judge John W. DeGroot had ruled that the only relevant issue in
the trial was whether or not the trio planted an illegal
crop.&nbsp; &quot;Being a protest is not a defense to the
[cultivation] charge,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Ironically, Kiczenski believes that the Court's hardline approach
may have actually helped Three Hawk Stand's defense.&nbsp;
&quot;The prosecutor and the judge worked too hard,&quot; said
Steffens' attorney, Nancy Lord.&nbsp; &quot;The jury thought the
whole thing was rigged.&quot;&nbsp; The defendants were successful
in arguing that the seeds they had planted were legally
sterilized hemp seeds which were incapable of producing actual
marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition to reaching the three not guilty verdicts, the jury
also presented a prepared statement to the court regarding the
reasons behind and the potential impact of their decision.&nbsp;
Jury foreman Dean Mitchell read the following: &quot;Some jurors
agree with the cause in which you believe; some jurors are
totally opposed.&nbsp; Our verdict went outside of your
cause.&nbsp; The evidence left reasonable doubt in our
minds.&nbsp; Our admonishment to you three defendants is that we
are not sending you on a seed planting mission, but rather we
suggest you pursue your cause through alternative methods.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now that he's been acquitted, Kiczenski maintains that he will do
just that.&nbsp; Kiczenski plans to file a civil lawsuit
challenging the DEA's assumed control and jurisdiction over the
production of hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kiczenski has received media attention in the past by mailing
marijuana to President Bill Clinton.&nbsp; He is a former High
Times &quot;Freedom Fighter of the Month.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Cannabis Patient Continues To Be
Denied Prescription<br>
Allegations of Civil Rights Abuses Prompt NORML Lawyers To Take
Action</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 2, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; Recent
events have discouraged hopes that medical cannabis user Todd
McCormick will be legally permitted to use his prescribed
medicine -- marijuana -- while in jail.&nbsp; According to
McCormick, Judge Anthony Gretich is now requiring that an
American physician who has physically examined McCormick must
additionally submit a written statement supporting his
prescription for cannabis.&nbsp; McCormick must also secure a
local Ohio doctor to oversee the administration of his
prescription. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick already has letters from three prominent American
doctors (<b>NORML</b> Board Chairman Lester Grinspoon M.D., <b>NORML</b>
Board member John Morgan, M.D., and Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.)
supporting his prescription.&nbsp; Inexplicably however, although
McCormick received these supportive statements on August 18, he
maintains that his public defender, John Schaffer, failed to file
any motions on his client's behalf until September 1.&nbsp;
McCormick had initially believed that the Court needed written
support from only one physician. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Even more alarming were recent reports of civil and
constitutional rights violations taking place against
McCormick.&nbsp; Following McCormick's live-from-prison telephone
interview with a local Ohio radio station, Warden Jim Dennis
reportedly forbade McCormick any further press contact.&nbsp; He
was also denied access to phone calls and visitors.&nbsp; In
response to these allegations, Cleveland attorneys Gordon S.
Friedman and Terry H. Gilbert of <b>NORML</b>'s Legal Committee
faxed a letter on September 1 to Warden Dennis informing him that
they bad been requested to investigate the abuse charges.&nbsp;
As a result of their letter, the Todd McCormick Alliance reports
that the warden has renewed McCormick's phone privileges and is
once again permitting him to speak to the media.&nbsp; The warden
is also allowing McCormick to use muscle relaxers to help
alleviate the pain and limited lateral head movement he suffers
as a result of acute nerve damage in his neck. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick is presently awaiting trial on four felony drug charges
following the discovery of 31 pounds of marijuana in his vehicle
by Ohio State Highway Patrolmen.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that the
cannabis, which was clearly marked &quot;for medicinal use
only,&quot; was intended to be used to establish a Compassionate
Use Club in Rhode Island and was not meant for sale.&nbsp;
McCormick had previously founded a Compassionate Use Club in San
Diego. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A hearing to determine whether or not McCormick's $50,000 bail
should be lowered will be held on September 7, 1995. <br>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Court Of Appeals Reverses Czuprynski
Conviction</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 1, Bay City, MI:</b>&nbsp; Ed
Czuprynski, the Bay City attorney who in 1992 was sentenced to 14
months in federal prison for possessing 1.6 grams of marijuana,
has had his conviction reversed by the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals.&nbsp; Concluding that Federal Judge Robert Cleland
&quot;abused [his] discretion&quot; in his evidentiary rulings
during Czuprynski's trial, the higher court determined that the
prosecution lacked sufficient relevant evidence to show that Czuprynski
knowingly possessed marijuana.&nbsp; Czuprynski had maintained
throughout both his trial and conviction that the marijuana found
in his office had been planted and that his prosecution was political. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a written statement affirming the higher court's decision to
reverse, two of the judges admit that &quot;the [Czuprynski]
case...has occupied untold judicial resources.&quot;&nbsp; The
document also specifies that the amount of marijuana involved in
the case was &quot;minute&quot; and &quot;meager.&quot;&nbsp;
Federal sentencing guidelines for minor amounts of marijuana do
not recommend that a prison sentence should exceed more than 6
months. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski's September 1 victory is actually the second time that
his conviction has been reversed.&nbsp; Czuprynski first won a
reversal of his possession conviction in November of 1993, but the
conviction was later upheld following the government's
appeal.&nbsp; Czuprynski said that he would not be surprised if
the government chose to appeal this latest decision as well. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Ed Czuprynski @ (517)
894-1155.&nbsp; A copy of the 7 page Order by the Court of
Appeals is available upon request.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>Prisoner To Be Force-Fed Intravenously<br>
Despite Availability Of Prescription Alternative</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 7, 1995, Fort Worth, TX:</b>&nbsp;
Despite the fact that Alan McLemore has a doctor's prescription
for Marinol, jail officials continue to deny him access to the
medication because it is a schedule II narcotic.&nbsp; McLemore
maintains that he has no appetite without daily use of the drug and
has not eaten a meal in the past 34 days.&nbsp; McLemore had
previously been allowed to use Marinol while he was incarcerated
at the Jefferson County jail in Beaumont, Texas.&nbsp; He had maintained
a stable body weight of approximately 160 pounds during that
time. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, McLemore's wife, Maggie Carter-McLemore, reports
that her husband is now undergoing an isolated 72-hour
&quot;observation period.&quot;&nbsp; Following this period,
McLemore is to begin intravenous force-feeding.&nbsp; Ms.
Carter-McLemore maintains that the law permits force-feeding only
as a last resort and believes that Fort Worth Federal
Correctional Institution authorities are in violation of the law
by not granting her husband the prior option of using
Marinol.&nbsp; In a recent audio-taped phone conversation with
his wife, McLemore stated: &quot;They may kill me in here.&nbsp;
I'm worried about it.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the past, McLemore had used both marijuana and Marinol to
provide relief from chronic migraines, depression, weight loss,
and alcoholic tendencies. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on Alan McLemore, please contact Judy
McLemore @ (409) 423-2429 or contact Ralph Hodges @ Houston NORML
