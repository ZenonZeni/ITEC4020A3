Abstract: Outdoor air quality has generally improved in the UK
over the last 2 decades but during this period changing conditions
within the home have tended to reduce ventilation and increase
the opportunity for accumulation of undesirable levels of indoor
air pollutants. Information obtained from laboratory and epidemiological
studies suggests that indoor air pollutants are an important cause
of avoidable morbidity and mortality in the UK. This paper reviews
the major indoor air pollutants of concern in the UK and considers
some of the special issues relevant to indoor environment.

Abstract: Indoor air quality (IAQ) was assessed in homes in an
experimental community of single-family dwellings that had been
built with materials chosen for low pollutant emission and other
modified design features to provide enhanced residential indoor
air quality. The IAQ was measured in six of these experimental
homes and also in three conventionally built homes of similar
size and price range. The IAQ was assessed shortly after construction
before the houses were occupied and again after each of the houses
had been occupied for five months. Before occupancy, there were
higher levels of airborne particles and of some volatile organic
compounds in the conventional homes than in the experimental homes.
During occupancy, benzene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylene, and
o-xylene were all higher in the conventional homes, but dichloromethane,
Freon 11, and trichlorethylene were higher in the experimental
homes. In the conventional homes, mean levels of benzene and chloroform
increased, whereas methylchloroform and toluene levels decreased
from preoccupancy to occupancy. In the experimental homes, dichloromethane
increased, and m-and p-xylene and o-xylene decreased from preoccupancy
to occupancy. The results suggest that attached garages, geographical
siting, and occupants' activities substantially influenced the
IAQ in these homes. The enhanced indoor air quality homes tested
in this study were judged to be a least partially effective, with
the most obvious sustained IAQ benefits being related to the lack
of an attached garage.

Abstract: Ventilation design for underground car parks is studied,
first through a brief review of the ventilation requirement. Carbon
monoxide concentration is believed to be the most important chemical
species to be considered. Some results on field measurement of
underground car parks reported in the literature are reviewed.
The well-mixed model, which is a basic design model for studying
the transient variation of carbon monoxide concentration, is described.
The model is then revised to describe multiple sources of emission
for several cars staying in a carpark with their internal combustion
engines operating. Two mixing models proposed by Sandbert 1981)-Model
1, based on a displacement ventilation system and Model 3, based
on a ventilation system with a short-circuiting air flow path-are
applied to study the ventilation design in car parks. The technique
of computational fluid dynamics is used to verify those existing
models and then to compute the mixing factors concerned. Key system
performance parameters are calculated, and a set of graphs relating
those system performance parameters with the input design data
is presented. These graphs can be used for designing the required
ventilation rate for the system under different carbon monoxide
loads. Eight local car parks are surveyed to illustrate the application
of the model. Field measurement data on underground car parks,
as described above, are reviewed and applied to justify the mixing
models.

Abstract: Particle size distribution is important to characterize
airborne dust and to design particulate matter control strategies.
New data are needed on particle size distribution in swine buildings,
and the existing particle size distribution models need to be
evaluated. The log-normal, power law, and Weibull models did not
adequately describe the particle size distribution of dust samples
collected in rooms housing pigs. An alternative two-parameter
empirical model was developed that fit the data much more closely
than the other models. The parameters of the particle size distribution
function did not vary significantly among rooms housing pigs in
different stages of production, suggesting that similar dust control
strategies may be developed for a wide variety of pig housing
facilities.

Abstract: Sprinkling a small amount of mineral oil onto the floor
area in a livestock building has been demonstrated as an effective
method to reduce dust concentration. The objective of this study
was to evaluate mechanical properties of different types of oils
sprinkled at different temperatures and pressures. Six biological
oils (purified canola, crude canola, corn, sunflower, flax, and
soybean) and one mineral oil (baby oil) were evaluated at temperatures
between 10 and 40oC (50 and 104oF). Density and viscosity of the
oils were measured using a viscometer. Sprinkleability in terms
of droplet diameter and uniformity was measured under different
pressures using a computer image processing system and a microscope.
Oil mist at the animal and human breathing levels (0.1, 0.8, and
1.6 m [0.33, 2.62, and 5.25 ft] above floor) were examined during,
and 10 seconds after, oil sprinkling. Proper oil sprinkling should
be carried out at a pressure and temperature that produces oil
droplets smaller than an upper threshold diameter (UTD) to ensure
good sprinkleability, but larger than a lower threshold diameter
(LTD) to avoid producing oil mist. Optimum range of temperature
and pressure for each type of oil are recommended.

<P>
Abstract: The problems of developing countries are often very
different to those of the industrialised regions of the world.
The impact of VOC pollution in large cities in developing countries
has not been adequately considered. Many of these cities have
rapidly growing numbers of motor vehicles in climates that promote
the formation of photochemical smog. The health implications of
this, together with the cancer risks associated with several VOCs
have not yet been properly evaluated. The levels of a variety
of volatile organic compounds (VOC) were measured in several cities
in Asia;Bangkok, Manila and Beijing, and in South America, Sao
Paulo, Santiago and Caracas. Preliminary results of studies in
these countries have indicated that VOC levels are higher than
normally encountered in European counties and that indoor levels
are not significantly different to those outdoors. It is likely
that the majority of VOCs measured indoors and outdoors are attributable
to motor vehicles, although the results of samples currently being
analysed will enable a more detailed analysis to be given.

International Conference on Volatile Organic Compounds in the
Environment, held London, 7-9 November 1995, edited by J J Knight

in the indoor and outdoor air in six office buildings, along with
the measurement of other chemical, sensory and physical parameters.
The number of VOCs found in each building was higher than sixty.
The most abundant VOCs were aliphatic and aromatic compounds.
The VOCs detected in the outdoor air show a strong relation to
the traffic existing in the nearby area. Correlation of the concentrations
found in the indoor and outdoor air shows that the outdoor air
contributes significantly to the chemical pollution of the indoor
air in some of the buildings. The dominant indoor sources emitting
VOCs were permanent ones such as building materials and furniture.

Abstract: As the indoor air quality industry has grown, there
have been a number of new technologies that have burst upon the
marketplace. One of these technologies often called 'Air Quality'
or 'Volatile Organic Compound Sensors' (VOC) sensors have generated
great interest as a possible approach to control air quality in
all types of buildings. This section provides an overview of CO2
and air quality sensors and outlines the best application for
both types of technology. While both sensor technologies can be
useful in indoor air quality control they are not interchangeable.
Each has its own application.

Abstract: The objective of the study was to assess the actual
ventilation and indoor air quality in the Finnish building stock
(dwellings and day-care centers) with special reference to the
existing guideline values. Furthermore, the objective was to evaluate
the occurrence of symptoms and perceptions among occupants (adult
residents, children, workers) in relation to ventilation system,
ventilation rate and dampness. The study population in studies
I and III consisted of 242 dwellings with 473 adult residents
in the Helsinki metropolitan area. In study V, the study population
consisted of a random sample of 2,568 pre-school children living
in the city of Espoo, part of the Helsinki metropolitan area.
In studies II, IV and VI, the study population consisted of a
random sample of 30 day-care centers and their 268 female workers
in Espoo. The measurements of ventilation and indoor air quality
in the dwellings and day-care centers included ventilation rate,
CO2 concentration, and temperature and humidity. Self- and parent-administered
questionnaires were distributed to the occupants inquiring their
personal characteristics, occurrence of symptoms of interest,
perceived indoor air quality and details of their home and work
environments. The results indicate that there is much room for
improvement in the ventilation and indoor air quality of Finnish
dwellings and day-care centers. The control of ventilation, temperature
and humidity and the prevention of water damage are important
issues on which to concentrate in the future. There is need to
improve the quality in all phases of construction:design, installation,
adjustment, operation, and maintenance.

Abstract: We ventilate buildings to create comfortable and healthy
indoor conditions. For comfort ventilation, indoor spaces must
receive a sufficient quantity of outdoor air tempered to satisfy
thermal comfort needs, and a sufficient quantity of clean air
to create acceptable indoor air quality. Comfort ventilation is
assessed by measuring occupant perceptions of indoor air quality,
including their assessments of odors, thermal conditions, and
ventilation adequacy. For health ventilation, indoor spaces must
receive air that is free from hazardous chemical or microbiological
contaminants. Health ventilation is measured by comparing levels
of indoor air pollutants against threshold limit values (TLVs)
or permissible exposure levels (PELs) for those pollutants.

Abstract: The term&quot;healthy building&quot;, has been popularized
in recent years as a response to the previously popular term,
'sick building'. It is difficult to define healthy buildings or
to establish criteria for classifying buildings as healthy without
referring to the presence or absence of problems, occupant complaints,
and illnesses. In practice, we generally define 'sick buildings'
by the prevalence rates of occupant health, and comfort problems.
The complexity of modern buildings, the diversity of actors involved
and processes for making them, and the importance of building
environments for people in modern western societies present large
challenges to those who would create healthy buildings. A new
paradigm is needed to understand buildings, how they become unhealthy,
and how to keep them from becoming 'sick'. 'Building ecology'
is a conceptual framework for understanding buildings and creating
healthy ones. Practical steps are recommended to develop a more
complete theoretical framework and application principles. A few
criteria for healthy buildings can serve as examples for the development
of a more complete set.

Abstract: During the last decade, the concepts of 'sick' and 'healthy'
buildings have been introduced and debated at regional, national
and international conferences. Although these concepts have helped
the research community to focus on the integration of health and
building sciences, they have also caused controversy, especially
among those who are responsible for the financing, design, construction,
and operations of buildings and their systems. In this address,
three national or multi-national studies now being conducted in
Europe, North America, and Japan are described and compared to
previously reported studies with regard to their characterizations
of the health of the existing building stock. The concepts of
Continuous Degradation and Continuous Accountability are the described,
followed by an overview of evolving diagnostic procedures and
evaluation criteria. These trends and concepts are then considered
through lessons learned in practice, including: the validity of
Continuation Degradation; the practicality of Continuous Accountability;
the need for rational evaluation criteria; the effectiveness of
diagnostic procedures, and need to document the benefits of Healthy
Buildings.

The article deals with exposure of the population inside building

types of agents. At first it is chemical pollutants. Sulphur and
nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, ozone and radon are indoor air
pollutants studied in detail. Two components of building indoor
environment have been taken into account so far. It is thermal
comfort and indoor air quality. This seems to be insufficient
at present. Especially indoor air quality needs to be specified.

Abstract: The appropriate specific short term technical fixes
for a facility with Indoor Air Quality concerns will always be
based on HVAC system limitations, any ability to eliminate or
reduce pollutant sources, associated health risks, and the budgets
that can be identified for corrective actions. Decreasing the
likelihood of any facility to have Indoor Quality problems must
begin with sound conceptual building system designs and include
a cost effective easy to maintain HVAC system. With detailed design
and construction work we are confident that a good quality, low
maintenance, central ventilation system can be installed in most
schools within the project budget. Unit ventilators may have a
lower first cost but their life cycle costs will be far more than
central systems taking energy and maintenance into consideration
over the 30 year life span of a typical school project. Additionally,
unit ventilators will never deliver the high quality indoor environment
that is possible with a well designed and operated centralized
system be it displacement or conventional. Finally, the concepts
utilized in the design of a vertical displacement ventilation
system for high density human occupied spaces are very similar
to the concepts utilized for the design of an industrial application.
We look forward to the opportunity to move the concept to both
other climatic regions and an industrial application, ad the situation
may arise.

Abstract: There is little data available on the concentration
of volatile organic compounds is dwellings and office buildings
in the Czech Republic. There is data on formaldehyde concentrations
in buildings but it is mostly collected from buildings where people
have complained about the quality of indoor air, especially when
it is known that the building materials or furnishings may contain
formaldehyde. Since the complaints of occupants of a building
are generally non-specific, it is sometimes very difficult to
guess what is the main problem in the building. When it is suggested
that the problem could be due to something familiar and various
possibilities, for example dry air or volatile organic compounds,
are put forward these suggestions are often accepted. Probably
because they are familiar and understood by the occupants. We
have made some measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC)
in non-industrial and non-occupational environments. People were
asked about any problem they had with the environment. Most often
they replied that the problems were of annoyance or unpleasant
smells. A common complaint is dryness of mucous membranes. This
problem is not dangerous from the point of view of people's health
but does concern their quality of life. For people with chronic
respiratory disease, including allergies, such irritation of the
mucous membrane, or skin, could worsen their condition. The low
concentrations of VOC's and formaldehyde that we found indoors
in non-industrial environment are probably not dangerous, but
can reduce the quality of life for the people in the buildings.
The quality of life if said to have some connection with the immune
system. From that point of view even the low concentration of
chemical compounds indoors can affect people.

Abstract: Exposure to VOCs present in the air we breathe may have
effects on people's health and well-being. Exposure in our homes
can make a significant contribution to our total exposure to VOCs.
To investigate the factors determining the concentration of VOCs
and formaldehyde in homes, diffusive sampling techniques have
been used to monitor the indoor air in five UK homes and one outdoor
location over a three year period. The main total volatile organic
compound (TVOC) concentration recorded indoors was 200 ug m3 and
this was six times higher than the outdoor concentration. The
relative amounts of individual compounds recorded indoors and
outdoors varied depending on the relative importance of indoor
and outdoor sources for each compound. Differences in concentrations
detected between rooms in the same home indicate that an individual's
exposure to formaldehyde and VOCs will be influenced by the time
spent in different rooms of the home. There was significant variation
in the concentrations of formaldehyde and VOCs over time. For
formaldehyde seasonal effects were found to dominate, with higher
concentrations being recorded in summer than in winter, whilst
for other VOCs occupant activities were more important. For example,
higher concentrations of TVOCs and undecane were found to relate
to greater amounts of painting in the home.

Abstract: The last decade has seen the publication of an increasing
number of scientific papers in which lung tumours have been induced
in rats following chronic exposure by inhalation to a range of
insoluble, respiratory-sized particulate dusts which hitherto
have been considered to be biologically inert. Such substances
include talc, titanium dioxide, volcanic ash and carbon black.
Such particles have generally been considered 'nuisance dusts',
possibly capable of eliciting fibrogenic changes, but not cancer.
The one feature that all these studies in rats have in common
is that the experimental exposures induced 'over-loading' of the
lung as evidenced by an increase in lung weight, retention of
particles and chronic and marked inflammatory changes. All of
this was preceded by an underlying 'overloading' of the alveolar
macrophages to the point where they stopped removing particles
from the lung. This can happen in a number of experimental species,
but it is only the rat that appears to respond with lung tumours
as an additional pathological response. This points to the lung
tumours being a rat-specific response and thus not a very useful
end-point for human risk evaluation for such biologically inert
particles. In support of this view is the remarkable observation
that in the one well-studied occupational group that routinely
has 'particle overload; in the lungs, namely coal miners, there
is no evidence that they experience an excess risk of lung cancer.

Abstract: Exposure to organic dust components was studied in four
potato processing plants because preliminary results showed high
exposures accompanied by work-related health complaints. Ambient
air concentrations of inhalable dust ranged from below 0.4 up
to 44mg m-3 [geometric mean (GM) 0.64 mg m-3}. Respirable dust
concentrations were considerable lower. Personal concentrations
of inhalable dust were somewhat higher, and strongly related to
a few working tasks dealing with dried starch or protein. Ambient
air concentrations of endotoxin ranged from 0.5 to more than 60,000
endotoxin units (EU) per m3 for the inhalable size fraction (GM
+ 280 EUm-3). For the respirable size fraction, endotoxin concentrations
were lower (about the same factor as for dust). Personal endotoxin
concentrations were lower than ambient air concentrations, probably
because workers did not work the whole period of the shift near
endotoxin sources. Endotoxin exposure was evaluated as very high;23%
of the workers had a mean exposure above 1000EUm-3 (100ng m-3).
Differences between plants had a large influence on both dust
and endotoxin exposure. A fairly good correlation was found between
counts of airborne gram-negative bacteria and airborne endotoxin
of the respirable size fraction. Ambient air levels of bacteria
and endotoxin were strongly related to process water temperature,
suggesting that exposure reduction can be achieved by lowering
this temperature or by other measures that inhibit bacterial growth.
We conclude that recycling of process water probably constitutes
an exposure source of bacteria and endotoxin in many facilities.

Abstract: Dust in animal buildings should be controlled to levels
that affect health only minimally. Dust control strategies include
reducing the rate of emission (source control), effective ventilation
(ventilation control), and air cleaning (removal control). Source
control strategies include use of feed additives, cleaning dusty
surfaces and spraying water or oil over dusty surfaces. Ventilation
control includes purge ventilation and effective room air distribution.
Air cleaning strategies involve filtration, electrostatic precipitation,
or wet scrubbing. Promising techniques for livestock buildings
include the use of additives, oil or water spraying, purge ventilation
and effective room air distribution. Technical and economic constraints
have prevented these methods from being widely practiced. Effective
and economically feasible dust control methods should be developed
and systematically tested under both controlled laboratory and
field conditions. Other research and development needs include:
1) characterization of dust particles, dust sources and sinks;
and 2) development of sensors and control devices that incorporate
the dust control technology into the environmental control system.

Abstract: A registry-based case control study, involving 120 cases
(28 males, 92 females) of lung cancer deaths, was conducted in
1985 in the city of Guangzhou to investigate whether lifestyle
factors are associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer
in never-smoking individuals. The cases were matched with two
control groups which consisted of non-respiratory-disease-related
deaths or non-respiratory-related cancer deaths. Lifestyle factors
assessed in the study include: personal history of nonmalignant
respiratory diseases, practice of fresh vegetable consumption,
lifetime occupation and occupational exposure histories, exposure
to ETS, degree of indoor air pollution, general conditions of
home residence, cooking practices and environments, and family
history of cancer. Conditional logistic regression analysis demonstrated
a negative association between fresh vegetable consumption and
lung cancer risk in both sexes, suggesting that vegetables may
exert a 'protective' effect against lung cancer in humans. In
males, elevated risks were found between lung cancer and occupational
exposure. In females, indoor air pollution and kitchen environment
were associated with risk of lung cancer. No statistically significant
association was observed between lung cancer and all other factors
examined, including exposure to ETS. A second case-control, study
was performed in 1986 to investigate the possible association
between spousal smoking and lung cancer deaths. Cases consisted
of 75 never-smoking females and the two control groups consisted
of 126 cases of deaths due to tumors except lung cancer. When
cases were matched against&quot;death-unrelated-to-tumor&quot;
controls, the odds ration [OR] for ETS exposure was 1.19, as gauged
by whether or not there was ETS exposure;0.72 and 1.62, when ETS
was assessed based on exposure to less than 20 or to 20 or more
cigarettes/day. When ETS exposure was measured by 'smoking years'.

Abstract: The increased use of water-based paints (WBP) has changed
exposure conditions for Swedish house painters but few exposure
measurements have been made during the indoor application of WBP.
The main aim of this study was to identify and quantify exposure,
particularly to volatile organic compounds (VOC)during the indoor
application of water-based paint. A secondary aim was to evaluate
the efficacy of different sampling absorbents for the measurement
of the major VOCs emitted from WBP. Exposure measurements of VOCs
formaldehyde, ammonia, dust and metals were performed by personal
sampling during the indoor application of WBPs commonly used in
Sweden, VOCs were sampled on different sorbents, and were analysed
by gas chromatography with a mass selective detector. The desorbtion
efficiency of different sorbents was also determined and XAD-7
was found to be the most appropriate for glycols and glycol ethers.
Exposure to VOCs formaldehyde, ammonia and metals was low, compared
with current Swedish permissible exposure limit values (PEL) but
dust exposures were found in excess of the PEL of 10mg m-3. A
large proportion of the VOCs consisted of propyleneglycol (PG),
diglycol ethers, Texano (2,2,4-trimethyl 1,3-pentanediol monoiso-butyrate),
and iso-butanol. The introduction of water-based paints has improved
the work environment for most house painters by reducing the total
VOC exposure, but VOC exposure has now shifted towards compounds
which are more polar and which have higher boiling points.

Abstract: There is a growing concern about indoor air quality
(IAQ) in schools, We have studied relations between subjective
indoor air quality (SIAQ) and measured IAQ among school personnel
(N=97) in six mid-Swedish primary schools. Information on SIAQ
and the psychosocial work environment was measured by a self-administered
questionnaire, using analogue rating scales. Indoor exposures
were quantified by hygienic measurements. Perception of high room
temperature was related to a poor climate of cooperation, fleecy
wall materials, and the concentration of volatile organic compounds
(VOC), including xylene, limonene, and butanols. Perception of
air dryness was related to atopy, work stress, poor climate of
cooperation, high room temperature, low air humidity, and high
VOC concentration,including, limonene, and n-alkanes. Perception
of dusty air was related to work stress, the role of schoolteacher,
and exposure to 2-ethyl-1-hexanol. No relations were found between
SIAQ and CO2. building age, or respirable dust. To achieve a good
SIAQ, room temperature should be kept at a maximum of 22oC, and
exposure to VOCs and fleecy materials should be minimized. Finally,
a sound psychosocial work climate is essential for the perception
of a good physical indoor climate.

Abstract: Numerous methods attempt to measure the combined concentrations
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor air as total VOCs
(TVOC). This paper reviews TVOC methods recently presented in
the literature and at an international conference on indoor air
quality, for the purpose of identifying common practices and of
assessing the impacts that choices of sample collection media
and analytical methods and instrumentation can have on TVOC results.
The paper also presents the results of laboratory and field comparisons
of three TVOC methods. These are a flame-ionization-detector (FID)
method, a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method,
and a method employing a photoacoustic infrared (IR) gas monitor.
The laboratory experiments were conducted with eight different
mixtures of VOCs. The FID method demonstrated an average accuracy
of 93+18per cent when the measured values were calculated as concentrations
of carbon. The FID and GC/MS methods demonstrated average accuracies
of 77+37 and 75+22 percent, respectively, when the measured hydrocarbon-equivalent
values were compared to the expected mass concentrations of the
mixtures. The higher uncertainty for the FID was largely due to
the low mass response of 27 percent for chlorinated compounds.
The response of the IR gas monitor varied between 6 and 560 percent
for different classes of compounds. Air samples from ten buildings
were analyzed by both the FID and GC/MS methods. The results were
highly correlated and similar, with the GC/MS values approximately
20 percent higher on average.

Abstract: To assess the effectiveness of mitigative measures against
radon (222Rn) entry into houses, experiments were conducted in
crawl-space house where the dirt floor of the crawl space was
covered with sheets of 0.23 mm polethylene foil fixed to the walls.
The radon concentration was measured below the foil and in the
crawl space together with environmental variables such as indoor-outdoor
pressure differences. The sub-foil region was small compared with
the crawl space and in direct contact with the soil, and because
the influence of ventilation and radon emerging from building
materials was largely suppressed. The experimental data was analyzed
using various types of models including a simplistic mass-balance
model, a regression model, and a two-dimensional numerical model
based on Darcy flow of soil gas and combined diffusive and advective
transport of radon. The main outcome of the work was that :(i)
The soil-gas entry rate per Pascal depressurization was at the
order of 1 m3 h-1 corresponding to an effective soil permeability
of 5.10-10m2, (ii) the stack-related part of the depressurization
of the crawl space (approx. 0.1 PaoC-1)was controlled by the temperature
difference between the living room of the house and the outdoors
(not by the difference between the crawl space and the outdoors),
(iii) that part of the wind-related depressurization that was
measured by the pressure transducers seemed to force radon into
the crawl space in the same proportion as the stack-related part
of the depressurization, (iv) the ratio of advective and diffusive
entry was approx. 0.7, when the crawl space was depressurized
1.5 Pa,(v) the effective diffusivity of the foil was found to
be three orders of magnitude larger than that measured in the
laboratory (the enhanced diffusivity was most likely caused by
leaks in the foil and by mixing fans located in the crawl space),
and (vi) there was no measurable mitigative impact of having the
sheets of foil on the crawl-space floor even if the crawl space
was artificially pressurized or depressurized.

Research as a state of the art review of bioaerosols. The book
is offered as a synthesis of the information available at the
time of publication and is intended to provide background for
students and practitioners of air pollution research.
