			<P><B>The accompanying consolidated financial statements of TVX Gold Inc. and all the information in this annual report are the responsibility of management and have been approved by the Board of Directors.</B>

			<P>The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Canada. When alternative accounting methods exist, management has chosen those it deems most appropriate in the circumstances. Financial statements are not precise since they include certain amounts based on estimates and judgments. Management has determined such amounts on a reasonable basis in order to ensure that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects. Management has prepared the financial information presented elsewhere in the annual report and has ensured that it is consistent with that in the financial statements.

<P>TVX Gold Inc. maintains systems of internal accounting and administrative controls in order to provide, on a reasonable basis, assurance that the financial information is relevant, reliable and accurate and that the Company’s assets are appropriately accounted for and adequately safeguarded.

<P>The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibilities for financial reporting and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the financial statements. The Board carries out this responsibility principally through its Audit Committee.

<P>The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board, and all of its members are outside directors. The Committee meets at least three times a year with management, as well as the external auditors, to discuss internal controls over the financial reporting process, auditing matters and financial reporting issues, to satisfy itself that each party is properly discharging its responsibilities, and to review the annual report, the financial statements and the external auditors’ report. The Committee reports its findings to the Board for consideration when approving the financial statements for issuance to the shareholders. The Committee also considers, for review by the Board and approval by the shareholders, the engagement or reappointment of the external auditors.

<P>Financial statements have been audited by Price Waterhouse, the external auditors, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards on behalf of the shareholders. 
Price Waterhouse has full and free access to the Audit Committee.
