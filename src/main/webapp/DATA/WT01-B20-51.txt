<p align="center"><b>In Oklahoma Franz Kafka Is Doing Very Well<br>
But Jimmy Montgomery Is Still Literally Rotting In Prison</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 11,</b> Paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery is
still suffering from a fever caused by the failure to properly
treat his anti-biotic resistant infections.&nbsp; His lesions are
still oozing.&nbsp; He still is unable to shower.&nbsp; He still
has no sterile bandages.&nbsp; Vindictive prosecutors,
incompetent prison officials, insensitive bureaucrats and
indifferent politicians keep his life in danger.&nbsp; All this
for less than two ounces of pot!&nbsp; Only the calls to the
governor's office by readers of these reports can save him.&nbsp; Please
do not give up.&nbsp; Jimmy has not.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Permissible Murders Part 2: Wisconsin Police
Kill Another Marijuana Suspect<br>
15 Year Old Shot By Narc Who Had Been Drinking</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 9,</b> Janesville, WI.&nbsp; Following the
fatal shooting of a marijuana suspect in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin
last week, 15 year-old Leon Kelly was shot to death by an
undercover officer who had been drinking.&nbsp; Kelly had
marijuana in his blood, according to police reports.&nbsp;
Shooting people is not considered the best way to test for
marijuana use, but a drug-free America comes first.&nbsp; There is
still no media coverage of these deaths, although most major
American newspapers have reported on the murder of a North
African immigrant in Paris.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Permissible Murders Happen Because Of
Permissible Hate Speech</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 6, 1990,</b> <i>The Los Angeles
Times</i> reported on the testimony before a U.S. Senate subcommittee
of then Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates in which Gates said
that casual drug users &quot;ought to be taken out and
shot.&quot;&nbsp; Gates made clear that he was talking about
marijuana smokers, &quot;who blast (sic, apparently one of
Gates's favorite words) some pot on a casual basis.&quot;&nbsp; Gates
went on to say that even casual use is &quot;treason.&quot;&nbsp;
If he had advocated genocide against any group other than
marijuana users, he would have been immediately removed from
office and Los Angeles might have been spared the terrible riots
that followed the acquittal of the police accused of beating
Rodney King.&nbsp; Gates was finally fired for incompetence after
that tragedy.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>1990,</b> Appearing on the television show, <i>Larry
King Live</i>, then drug czar William Bennett said beheading drug
dealers would be &quot;morally plausible&quot;.&nbsp; (He added,
&quot;There's no moral problem there.&nbsp; I used to teach
ethics---trust me.&quot;)</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 7, 1995,</b> <i>Boston Herald</i>
conservative columnist Don Feder calls for &quot;the Dresden
option&quot; to deal with illegal drugs.&nbsp; The reference to
the fire bombing of Dresden should be frightening to the citizens
of Los Angeles.&nbsp; As mentioned above, Chief Gates brought
them their own little Dresden.&nbsp; Hatred kills not just the
hated, but the haters and their silent allies.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>1991 National Guard Association Conference</b>
-- Lt. General John B. Conaway, Chief, National Guard Bureau
says, &quot;Our mission as America's National Guard in this war
(on drugs) is clear: make America drug-free in as short a time as
possible <b><i><u>using any means necessary, no matter what the
cost.&quot;</u></i></b>&nbsp; The people who did not take Gates
seriously also have not taken Conaway seriously.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 28, 1994,</b> Thomas Constantine, the head
of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), told the <i>Washington
Times</i> that the &quot;non-violent drug offender ... is a rare
species.&quot;&nbsp; He went on to say that illicit drug users
&quot;contribute nothing but evil.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Dutch Health Minister Joins Group Objecting
To Atlanta Mayors' Prohibitionist Conference</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>Atlanta,</b> Bob Keizer, who heads the
Department of Alcohol, Drug and Tobacco Policy of the Dutch
Ministry of Health is scheduled to join a group of prominent
American anti-prohibitionists, including the former mayor of
Hartford, to object to the misrepresentation of European drug policies
at an Atlanta conference of American mayors.&nbsp; <u>There will
be a Press Conference on Monday May 15th at 12:30 PM at the Hyatt
Regency Hotel Atlanta</u>.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Mayors' conference is being sponsored by the
National Institute on Drug Abuse, and other prohibitionist
propaganda agencies, such as the Partnership for a Drug-Free
(sic) America.&nbsp; (The Partnership is headed by the former CEO
of Johnson and Johnson and takes money from the alcohol, tobacco
and pharmaceutical industries.)&nbsp; On <b>Sunday, May 14,</b>
reform activists will demonstrate against the conference from 1-4
PM.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference, billed as &quot;American Cities
Against Drugs,&quot; is being held at tax-payers' expense.&nbsp;
The conference brochure promises that attendees can &quot;Hear
from key European mayors about the devastation legalization is
bringing to their cities.&quot;&nbsp; However, <u>there are no
cities in Europe in which drugs are legal</u>, so it is difficult
to understand how this could be a source of
&quot;devastation.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Only in the Netherlands will one find marijuana
being sold with the approval of the government, although even
that is technically illegal.&nbsp; There are no serious social
problems being observed as a result of this policy, which is
supported by all of the mayors of major Dutch cities.&nbsp; Last
year the Dutch government complained about anti-Dutch propaganda
being put out by the DEA.&nbsp; NORML is proud to have brought
these lies to the attention of America's oldest ally.</p>

<p align="center"><b>International Demonstrations Supporting
Dutch Policy Scheduled For May 19</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 19th,</b> a coalition of European
anti-prohibitionists are scheduling a series of demonstrations in
major European cities in support of Dutch drug policies.&nbsp;
NORML has joined in sponsoring their efforts.&nbsp; Next week,
NORML will issue a statement of appreciation for the Dutch cannabis
policies.</p>

Mayor's Conference and the counter-balancing press conferences

<p align="center"><b>Legal Defense Fund Being Organized For
Washington State Medical Marijuana Activists</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">As reported earlier this week, medical marijuana
activists in Washington State have been charged with cultivation
of marijuana which they were supplying to seriously ill and
disabled people in their area.&nbsp; They are being defended by
NORML Legal Committee member Jeffrey Steinborn. <br>
