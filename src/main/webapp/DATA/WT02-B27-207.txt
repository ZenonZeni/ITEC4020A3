<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Religion &amp; the Right to Die</H1>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-1>The Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Scotland is non-sectarian.
Our members include Christians of many denominations, including Roman Catholics,
as well as Buddhists and members of other faiths, and humanists, agnostics
and atheists. Religious questions involving euthanasia and suicide must
be individually resolved, with or without one's spiritual adviser, and
according to one's belief.</FONT></I></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>O</FONT>pinion polls </FONT></B>consistently
show a majority of people professing all variety of faiths support a change
in the law for voluntary euthanasia. Even amongst Roman Catholics, more
people support euthanasia than oppose it (a poll in Scotland showed over
50% support, in spite of the church's opposition).</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>O</FONT>fficial church policies
</FONT></B>usually oppose euthanasia. The Roman Catholic Church is the
largest single funder opposed to euthanasia. It invests more money in its
fight against euthanasia than all the combined resources of right to die
societies around the world many times over.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004000"><FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT>actics </FONT></B>in
support of the Roman Catholic Church's position apparently include disinformation
(usually claiming no safeguards) and threats of excommunication - this
was well documented in the heated campaigns of the USA and elsewhere.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#800040"><FONT SIZE=+1>O</FONT>f the other churches</FONT></B>,
the Episcopalian (Anglican) Unitarian, Methodist, Presbyterian and Quaker
movements are amongst the most liberal, allowing at least individual decision
making in cases of active euthanasia. Hindu and Sikh Dharma may also leave
it to individual conscience.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#808080"><FONT SIZE=+1>N</FONT>owadays</FONT></B>, few
faiths prohibit passive euthanasia, or refusal of treatment decisions.
Those that do tend to oppose it include conservative Evangelicals, Islam,
and the Mormon Church.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>S</FONT>uicide </FONT></B>(self-deliverance)
is accepted by a number of faiths. There is a Jaina ethic of voluntary
death through fasting, for instance. It is often thought that the Roman
Catholic Church absolutely prohibits suicide, but Catholic theologians
have confirmed that the prohibition, whilst being the Vatican's current
position, is not an inviolable one.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040"><FONT SIZE=+1>C</FONT>hurch hierarchies </FONT></B>are
generally not amenable to reasoning and arguments, however well they are
constructed, from the laity. Cultural forces and public opinion appear
to have an effect over time.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004080"><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT>lthough accepted </FONT></B>by
the very early church, mainstream Christian beliefs concerning suicide
were well documented by Thomas Aquinas (circa 1225-1274) who condemned
suicide because:</P>

<LI>&quot;it violates one's natural desire to live&quot;</LI>

<LI>&quot;it harms other people&quot;</LI>

<LI>&quot;life is the gift of God and is thus only to be taken by God&quot;</LI>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF"><FONT SIZE=+1>M</FONT>ichel de Montaigne </FONT></B>(1533-1592)
was the first major dissenter among European writers. He wrote 5 essays
which touched on the subject of suicide, arguing that suicide should be
considered a matter of personal choice, and that it is a rational option
under some circumstances.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#400040"><FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>n the U.S.</FONT></B>,The
Unitarian-Universalist Association, a liberal group, issued a statement
in 1988 in support of euthanasia and assisted suicide choice, if there
are proper precautions in place to avoid abuse. Similar statements were
made by the United Church of Christ, and the Methodist Church on the US
West coast.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#804040"><FONT SIZE=+1>I</FONT>n Netherlands </FONT></B>1972
the Dutch Reformed Church published a paper in which euthanasia was conditionally
accepted as a humane way of dying. In the Netherlands, Catholic or Dutch
Reformed clergymen may be present at VE deaths.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#004000"><FONT SIZE=+1>M</FONT>any religious orders
</FONT></B>in the United States invite (in some cases require) their members
to consider a living will of some kind. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>M</FONT>any prominent clerics
</FONT></B>support euthanasia - the Bishop of Durham (Dr David Jenkins),
Bishop Alastair Haggart (VESS Convener), Bishop Hare Duke (VESS member),
the Reverend Andrew Hill (VESS Committee Member), Lord Soper (Methodist
Life Peer), Canon William Purcell (ex-president of VES), Canon Dick Shepherd
and Dean Ing (founding fathers of the voluntary euthanasia movement in
1935), Revd John Brooke (United Church of Christ Minister and Director
of Americans for Dying With Dignity).</P>

<P><B>&quot;A common objection</B> in religious quarters is that suffering
is part of the divine plan for the good of man's soul, and must therefore
be accepted. Does this mean that the physician's Hippocratic Oath is opposed
to Christian virtue and doctrine? If this simple and naive idea of suffering
were a valid one, then one would not be able to give our moral approval
to anaesthetics, or to provide any medical relief for human suffering.
Such has been the objection of many religionists at every stage of medical
conquest, for example the use of anaesthetics at childbirth.&quot; <I>-
the ethicist, Joseph Fletcher</I></P>

<P><B>&quot;Abortion and euthanasia </B>are thus crimes which no human
law can claim to legitimize. There is no obligation in conscience to obey
such laws; instead there is a grave and clear obligation to oppose them
by conscientious objection. ... In the case of an intrinsically unjust
law, such as a law permitting abortion or euthanasia, it is therefore never
licit to obey it, or to &quot;take part in a propaganda campaign in favour
of such a law, or vote for it&quot;. <I>- John Paul II, On the Value and
Inviolability of Human Life, Evangelium Vitae, 73.</I></P>

<P><B>&quot;...For it is a question </B>of the violation of the divine
law, an offense against the dignity of the human person, a crime against
life, and an attack on humanity.&quot; - Roman Catholic Declaration on
Euthanasia</P>
