<h4>Impaired Driving Charges </h4>

The law governing the issue of impaired driving is found within 
both the Federal Criminal Code as well as the Highway Traffic Act 
of each Province.<p>

While a charge of impaired driving is an offence under federal law, 
in most cases there are provincial consequences of this offence which 
come into effect upon conviction.<p>

For example, in Ontario, the consequence of a first conviction is a 
minimum licence suspension of one year concurrent with the three 
months driving prohibition within the federal penalties.<p>

Listed below are the references to the sections of the Federal Criminal 
Code which relate to impaired driving and related offences.  Your local 
library will likely have the most current edition of the Revised 
Statutes of Canada in the Reference Section.  You may obtain a copy
through your local bookstore, or a pocket edition of the Criminal Code 
such as the Pocket Criminal Code printed by Carswell Publishing 
(ISBN 0-459-36211-9).<p>

<h3>Documenting Information</h3>

You may generally assume that the investigating officers have 
collected all the evidence they need.  However, it is wise to 
document everything about the crash at the time it comes to your 
attention.  You think you’ll remember all the facts, but documentation 
will ensure a good recollection of all details.<p>

In some cases, you will hear that additional witnesses want to 
come forward who have not been interviewed previously by the police.  
If so, refer them to the officer or the Crown who will take their 
statement.<p>

Photographs have probably been taken at the crash scene and perhaps 
at the hospital or the coroner’s office.  It is possible, however, 
that other pictures would be useful in both the criminal and civil 
cases.  You may be able to take photos of the recovery process of 
the injured victim which investigators cannot because their time 
is limited.  If you take pictures that you think may be helpful, 
have someone witness your taking the photographs.  You and the 
witness should sign and date the photos on the back, and then take 
them to the Crown Attorney.<p>

Ask for the return of any personal effects and/or clothing which 
will not be required as evidence in the court case.<p>

Keep all bills and receipts resulting from the crash.  Begin a 
day-by-day record of all financial expenditures or losses which you 
would not have had if the crash had not happened.<p>


You should keep track of your telephone conversations with anyone 
associated with the case.  Note the date, time and the key subject 
of the conversation for future reference.<p>

<h3>The Crown Attorney</h3>

Once the policing agency has laid charges, the case is referred 
to the crown attorney’s office.  This office is usually located 
inside the courthouse where the case will be heard.  Do not hesitate 
to ask the police for the location and telephone number of the 
crown attorney’s office.<p>

Phone the crown attorney’s office and ask if a crown attorney has 
been assigned to the case.  Please remember that the case is filed 
under the name and date of birth of the accused.
If you are told that a crown has not been assigned to the case, 
ask when it is expected that a crown attorney will be assigned.<p>

If it is getting very close to a court date and you discover that
a crown attorney has not been assigned, ask to speak to the Chief 
Crown Attorney.  Inform the Chief Crown Attorney who you are 
and indicate your concern.<p>

Once a crown attorney is assigned, phone and make an appointment 
with him.  Prepare a list of questions before the meeting to ensure 
you do not forget issues which you want to discuss.  It is important 
during this meeting to make your feelings known about plea 
bargaining, and your interest in submitting a Victim Impact 
Statement to the court.<p>

A recent picture of the victim before the injury or death may be 
taken with you to the crown attorney’s office.  As much as possible, 
you will want to reinforce that this crime was committed against 
a person and that your loved one was cared about by many people.  
You can also talk about how things have changed since the crash.<p>

In an effort to be kept informed of any changes in the status of 
the case, you  should:

<ol type=a>
<li>mail a follow-up letter to the crown attorney which outlines 
generally your discussion and your wish to be informed.<p>

<li>inform the investigating officer and the court 
clerk at the courthouse.
</ol>

Many jurisdictions in the country have some type of victim/witness 
programme to which you may be referred.  The purpose of these 
government funded programmes is to prepare a victim or witness 
for the upcoming proceedings.  This may involve a tour of a 
typical courtroom and orientation to the trial process.<p>

<h3>Plea Bargaining</h3>

This term refers to negotiations which take place between the 
crown attorney and the defense lawyer.  These negotiations may 
result in a guilty plea to a lesser charge or a guilty plea in 
exchange for a reduced sentence.  These bargains seem distasteful 
to victim families who feel that to cut a deal is to diminish 
the significance of the crime.  Crown attorneys and judges are 
eager to execute plea bargains because they do not have the time 
nor resources to take every case to trial.<p>


MADD Canada does not support plea bargaining and believes that 
all cases of the accused pleading not guilty should go to trial 
unless it is obvious that there is insufficient evidence to win 
a conviction.<p>

<h3>Going to Trial</h3>

If the defendant persists in pleading not guilty, the case will 
be set for trial.  He has a right to choose whether he wants 
his case to be decided by a judge alone or by a judge and jury.  
Be prepared for more delays after a trial date has been set.<p>

If the defendant chooses a jury trial, jury selection may take some 
time.  Most injured victims and surviving families want to attend 
the trial although they know it will be an emotionally draining 
experience.<p>

You may be surprised to learn that the defense may try to prevent
you from attending the trial.  The defense lawyer’s goal is to 
minimize the victim sympathy factor during the trial.  The defense 
wants any sympathy to be focused on the defendant and not the victim.<p>

Typically, the defense lawyer will request a publication ban on 
the evidence presented in the trial and on the name of the accused.  
Recently, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that very few 
publication bans are indeed necessary in order to protect the 
rights of those involved.  This may lead to a more open court 
process in all cases.<p>

<h3>Courtroom Guidelines</h3>

Do not discuss the case in the halls or restrooms.  Your behaviour 
out of the courtroom is as important as your behaviour in it.  You 
should remind any supporters who will be attending the proceedings 
that any disruption may result in a clearing of the courtroom of 
any spectators including the victim family as well as the 
possibility of a mistrial.<p>

Never speak to the judge or a juror - even if you encounter them 
in the hall or at lunch.  They must remain bias-free as they hear 
the evidence.<p>

Be prepared for the emotional impact of hearing the defendant 
say not guilty.  Even though you know there would not be a trial 
unless he was pleading not guilty, many victims report a jarring 
emotional response when they actually hear the words.  In many 
cases, these are the first words the victim or the victim family 
has heard the defendant speak.<p>

Expect to hear upsetting testimony.  You may hear gruesome details 
for the first time.  You may see photos you have never been shown 
before.  You may also hear the defense lawyer attempt to show that 
you or your loved one were responsible for the crash.  He has an 
ethical responsibility to do all he can to represent his client’s 
legal interests.  Therefore, much of what is so important to you 
may seem like gamesmanship of players who try to outskill each 
other in courtroom drama.  It is up to the judge or jury to 
determine the truth.<p>

If you feel you may lose control of your emotions during the trial, 
leave the courtroom.  Your presence or demeanor in the courtroom 
must not be intended to influence the judge or jury.<p>

If you have questions or concerns during the trial, write them 
down and give them to the crown attorney or victim advocate.<p>

Remember throughout the trial process that the burden of proof 
in the case is the responsibility of the crown and that the 
defense need only create an element of doubt for the case to be lost.

<h3>The Verdict</h3>

Hearing the announcement of the verdict is the climax of the 
trial and usually a very emotional time for the victim and/or 
victim family.  You must be aware that a legal verdict and the 
truth are, unfortunately, not always the same thing.  While a 
defendant may not, in truth, be innocent, he may be proven not 
guilty.<p>  
Judges and juries are the best way our society knows 
to determine legal justice.  Judges and juries are also 
susceptible to human error.  All of this must be kept in 
perspective.  The standard of proof in criminal cases is beyond 
a reasonable doubt, the highest burden of proof required in any 
trial proceeding.  If any doubt based on reason exists as to any 
element of the offense as charged, the verdict of the judge and/or 
judge and jury must be not guilty. Evidence must establish the 
facts so clearly, positively, and explicitly that there can be 
no reasonable doubt that the case was proven.<p>

<h3>Young Offenders Act</h3>

Young people under the age of 18 years of age accused of offences 
contrary to any law are subject to the provision of the Young 
Offenders Act.  This law was intended to provide young people 
with an opportunity to avoid the stigma of a criminal record 
for minor transgressions which could occur due to inexperience 
or a momentary lack of judgment.<p>

This Act has become the source of controversy because of a 
tremendous increase in youth crime, recitivism and in particular, 
the increase in the frequency of violent crimes such as impaired 
driving committed by those under 18 years of age.<p>

If the accused is a young offender, you as the victim have to 
request access to any records on the specific crime for which 
he is accused.  Section 44.1 (5) states in part, "Any record 
that is kept ... may, on request, be made available for 
inspection to the victim of the offence to which the record relates."<p>

Sentencing,  relating to impaired driving cases,  has caused 
many victims to feel that the young person has not been held 
truly accountable for their behaviour especially when the young 
person has accepted an adult responsibility such as driving.<p>

In some cases, victims feel that they understand the need for 
the young offender to
have future opportunities which could be limited through 
extended incarceration, but also feel that the death or injury 
of their loved one should not be minimized.  In these 
circumstances, some victims advocate for the judge to impose 
a significant period of licence revocation in addition to a 
community service order for the young offender.

<h3>What Can You Do? </h3>

<h3>The Crash Report</h3>

The crash report, or accident report as it is sometimes called, 
is prepared by the law enforcement agency which investigated the 
crash.  It is usually the municipal police service if the crash 
occurred within the city limits.  In other areas, the 
investigation and reporting may be done by the Provincial Police 
or the R.C.M.P.<p>

In most circumstances, you may obtain a copy of the report 
through the investigating officer who is assigned to the case.  
The investigating officer will often ensure that any nominal 
fee which may usually be charged for the document preparation 
is waived.  If a fee is charged, keep the receipt in case you 
may be reimbursed at a later date.<p>

If you are having difficulty obtaining a copy of the report, 
call the appropriate agency, give the date and location of the 
crash, and ask how and when you may obtain copies of the initial 
report and any supplementary reports.<p>

Sometimes the investigating officer will give you a reference 
number of the report at the scene, at the hospital, or at the 
death notification.<p>

Make note of  the officer's name, as well as the police agency 
affiliation and telephone number.  <p>

Ask as many questions as you require in order to get the 
information that you need.  At a time such as this, there are 
no stupid questions.<p>

When you get the report, which is considered public information 
under the Freedom of Information Act, look it over closely 
for the following data:

<ul>
<li>Do you see any errors or omissions in the report?  If so, 
report them immediately to the investigating officer whose name 
appears on the report.  Even if they seem minor, they can be 
crucial to court cases.  
<li>Are there any indications on the report that the accused 
had been drinking or using other drugs?  If so, see if a Blood 
Alcohol Content (B.A.C.) level is indicated.  B.A.C. is usually 
determined by breath or blood testing shortly after the crime 
was committed.  If the tests were not performed, you should ask why they were not.
Tests should be given following crashes in which alcohol or other 
drug use is suspected.  All too often, however, testing is not done 
or procedures are not followed properly.<p>
</ul>

<h3>Victim Impact Statements</h3>

The Criminal Code of Canada (S. 735) provides that victims 
may submit a written statement to the court about the impact 
of the crime on their lives.  These statements are used in the 
sentencing phase of the proceedings.<p>

Each province provides a format to be followed for the submission 
of these statements to the court.  Ask the crown attorney, court 
clerk or the MADD Canada National Office for this information.<p>

In preparing statements, be sure your information is accurate.  
Write from the heart about your pain, but do not make bitter or 
negative remarks about the offender.  The judgment of the 
defendant belongs to the court.<p>

We have enclosed a sample of a Victim Impact Statement to help you.  
Your local Chapter of MADD Canada can assist you in preparing 
your statement and give you additional samples which have been written.<p>

<h3>Sample Victim Impact Statement</h3>

<dl>
<dd>Your Honour,<p>

It has been 18 months since Debbie was killed, but to us it seems 
like it was just yesterday.  Our lives started new and we were 
filled with pain from that day on.  For each day that we have to 
live without her we feel cheated, never being able to touch her, 
see her, hear her talk or laugh.  Debbie was the spark in our 
small family of three.  She loved life and people, had many 
interests, found excitement in almost everything she did, and 
loved to share it with us.<p>

There is so much that I would like to tell you about Debbie: how 
she loved music, loved to sing and dance, volunteered at the 
senior’s home, how she loved to watch football with her 
father, was fascinated with magic tricks and loved animals.  
She hoped to be a vet some day to care for little furry creatures.  
She always brought home a stray cat or dog and made sure that 
the owner was found.<p>

Flashbacks from the crash fill my thoughts each night.  She did 
not have a chance.  Her life contrasted her death in so many 
ways.  No one’s life should end that way.<p>

The day we buried our Deb, the sun was shining and the sky was 
clear.  The air, however, was crisp and the wind ruffled through 
the flowers laying on her casket. <p> 

We loved Debbie so much and saw she had a bright future.  She 
would have been 17 years old today.  I hope and pray that no 
other family suffers this type of loss although I know it is 
all too common.<p>

Our family wants justice and for a strong message to be sent to 
those who would even consider getting behind the wheel of their 
cars after drinking.<p>
	
Sincerely,<p>
Mark & Dianne Webster.

<h3>Questions & Answers</h3>

<b>Will I need a lawyer?</b><p>

For the criminal proceedings, the crown attorney is the lawyer 
who will prepare the case.  It is wise, however, to consult a 
lawyer regarding matters such as insurance claims, estates and 
if personal injuries were involved.  A consultation with a 
lawyer is usually free.  Call the law society in your telephone 
book for referrals to lawyers in your area.<p>


<b>Can the drinking establishment be held liable?</b><p>

The drinking establishment may he held responsible in a civil 
case for serving the driver to the point of intoxication.  Both 
financial judgments and revocation of their permit to serve 
alcoholic beverages can result from irresponsible service.<p>


<b>I understand that the maximum sentence for impaired driving 
causing death is 14 years in prison, but what can we expect to happen?</b><p>

In the early 1980’s, it was common for an impaired driver 
convicted of killing someone to receive a $50. fine and a 
3 month licence suspension.<p>

In 1995, the typical sentence for this offence may range from 
2 - 3 years.  An offender serves a fraction of this sentence 
before beginning parole.<p>

Exceptional cases have resulted in higher sentences as the 
judges become more aware of the violent nature of this crime 
and the number of repeat offenders who eventually kill.<p>


<b>Is there any cost for MADD Canada services for victims?</b><p>

All of our victim services are organized by volunteers who 
donate their time to help.  Many of these volunteers have 
lost a loved one due to impaired driving and they want to 
help others.  In addition, information and referral services 
are provided at no cost.<p>


<b>Can someone from MADD Canada come to court with me?</b><p>

In many cases a volunteer will be available to accompany you 
to court to provide support and information.<p>


<b>Do I have to be a mother to be involved?</b><p>

MADD Canada involves the combined efforts of men and women 
of all ages who want to eliminate impaired driving and to help 
victims of this violent crime. All of our victim services are 
open equally to everyone.  <p>
