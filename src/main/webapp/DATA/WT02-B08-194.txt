<H1>The Shackleton Memorial Appeal</H1>
<P>

<B>"Largely through imperfect understanding, most mid-latitude dwellers 
perceive the natural environment of 
the polar regions as either hostile or fragile.  These views have coloured attitudes to exploration and 
development, often with damaging consequences and unnecessary conflicts between administrators, 
environmentalists and indigenous inhabitants.  Lack of understanding also represents a lost opportunity in 
that polar natural systems play a key role in modulating the global environment.  An improved 
understanding is necessary if we are to make meaningful predictions of environmental change on a global 
scale."<BR>
David E. Sugden, Professor of Geography, University of Edinburgh</B><P>

<H2>Polar Research</H2><P>

The vast wildernesses of the Arctic and Antarctic account for one-fifth of the Earth's surface. There,  
information vital to understanding the Earth's systems waits to be deciphered: ozone depletion was first 
observed in the Antarctic; deep ice cores record 100,000 years of climate history; and study of the role played 
by sea ice in carbon dioxide absorption promises insights into how quickly major climatic shifts can happen. 
The Arctic is also important for its resources and as the home of many indigenous people. But so little is 
known about the polar regions that it is fruitful to provide for polar research and for the storage of polar 
information in dedicated, multidisciplinary institutes.<P>

<H2>The Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI)</H2><P>

The Institute (SPRI) was founded in 1920, in Cambridge, as a memorial to Captain Scott and his four 
companions who died returning from the South Pole in 1912. When Scott's last words, "For God's sake, look 
after our people", were made known to the British nation, the response was tremendous.  Scott himself had 
emphasised the importance of science and, from this plea, the Institute was born.<P>

The Institute is the oldest international centre for polar research embedded in a university. Its 75 years of 
scientific exploration, collection, recording and interpretation of results makes it a unique institution both 
nationally and worldwide.
Many other institutes concerned with polar issues have grown up around it: the British Antarctic Survey, 
the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, the Cambridge Arctic Shelf Project, the World Data Centre 
'C' for Glaciology, the International Glaciological Society and the International Whaling Commission.<P> 

The Institute has fostered polar research worldwide through its participation in the training of scientists, its 
own research and the development of scientific techniques such as the radio echo sounding of glaciers. 
Additionally, its library and archives hold an unequalled collection of published and unpublished polar 
material.<P>

The Institute is proud of its postgraduates who work in every field of polar research: sea ice and polar 
oceanography, glacier geophysics, zoology, history, social sciences, resource and wilderness management and 
Russian northern studies.  Many of these graduates have become internationally-acknowledged leaders in their 
fields and have gained prominent positions in their universities and institutions.
<P>
Not only does the Scott Polar Research Institute support the academic community, but its museum brings polar 
history and research to the public through its collections, lectures, events and school programmes.<P>

<H2>The Shackletons</H2><P>

"Curiosity about and care of the remote parts of the world, concern for people, leadership and judgement - 
these are priorities of our times.  In few people have these been as strong as in the Shackletons, father and son:
Sir Ernest in the Antarctic during the first 20 years of this century, Edward Lord Shackleton KG, FRS from 
the 1930s to the 1990s.<P>

Of the classic explorers, the polar hero Ernest Shackleton ranks with Nansen, Peary and Amundsen. In 
Cherry-Garrard's unforgettable words: <B>'For a joint scientific and geographical piece of organisation, give 
me Scott; for a Winter Journey, Wilson; for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen: if I am in the 
devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me Shackleton every time.'</B>  Men would follow Shackleton 
unquestioningly and he never lost one; he knew how far to go and when to go no further. He brought them 
across the Weddell Sea after the loss of his ship and, almost unbelievably, he secured the safety of all of them 
as a result of the small boat journey to South Georgia across the worst ocean in the world.<P>

His son carried on the work of exploration in Ellesmere Land and Borneo but these were a prelude to a life of 
extensive distinction in science, conservation and politics, national and international.  Eddie Shackleton's 
leadership, his ability to win the understanding and affection of those of differing political conviction, were 
outstanding, not least in a generation in which tolerance has been at a premium.  A true Shackleton whose 
contribution had been in the context of today as was his father's in that of nearly a century ago."
<B>Sir Alexander Glen</B><P>

<H2>Planning for the Future: The Shackleton Memorial Library</H2><P>

The Institute's library is recognised as the world's premier polar information centre.  As an unparalleled 
resource of outstanding national and international importance, it is consulted by governments and industry, 
scientists and scholars.  It also houses one of  the world's  largest collections of  unpublished polar manuscripts 
and literature about snow and ice.<P> 

The existing archive and library facilities are filled to capacity.  In 1960, the Ford Foundation enabled the 
Institute to meet the challenge of an explosion in polar information following World War II.  Now, once again, 
the Institute has embarked on a major expansion of the library to serve the needs of the research community 
into the future.  This planned extension will be named the Shackleton Memorial Library in honour of the 
contributions made to polar research by Sir Ernest Shackleton and his son, Lord Shackleton.<P>

The new library will accomplish more than providing space for the expanding collection.  Through the use of 
digital scanning and remote access technology, researchers, on-site or via computer links, will have access to 
the manuscripts and library collections, the databank of polar images and artefacts, English and foreign 
language polar journals, and expertise from the Institute's staff.<P>

<H2>Investing in the Future - Opportunities for Partnership</H2><P>

In order to continue to provide its unique services to research and education of the highest possible quality, the 
Scott Polar Research Institute has prepared its plans for development.  The total cost to fund the building and 
equipping of the Shackleton Memorial Library will be <B>£1 million</B>, of which the University is providing 
£350,000.  The need to continue polar research is great and depends upon the contributions of individuals, 
institutions and corporations in order to be successful.<P> 

The University is seeking involvement, assistance and financial support from both individuals and the 
corporate sector.  Past and present corporate sponsors of the Institute include BP and Arco. Partnerships are 
sought to expand the Library and to support the Institute's work. The Institute is keen to foster relationships 
with individuals, other institutions  and corporations which have an interest in the polar regions.<P>
