sua sponte, that a briefing schedule be established as follows:

          Appellant(s)/Petitioner(s) Reply Brief                  11/20/95

     This notice does not preclude the court, after examination of the
briefs, from setting this case for oral argument.  If this case is

     All parties should include the following phrase on any pleading or
