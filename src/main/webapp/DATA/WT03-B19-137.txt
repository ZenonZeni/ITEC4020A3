<H2>Purpose</H2>

Government as part of AusIndustry. 
<H2>Background</H2>
Business Victoria is the principal agency in Victoria for AusIndustry,
a nationwide single gateway service to joint State/Commonwealth
business improvement services.
<P>
AusIndustry will build on the success of the National Industry
Extension Service <a href = "http://www.vicnet.net.au/vicnet/vicgov/invest/nies1.html">(NIES)</a> by providing an integrated range of enterprise
level programs and information services through an expanded delivery
network.
<P>
The Victorian Government has played a key role as a service deliverer
in the jointly funded NIES program
and has historically maintained a strong commitment to increasing
the international competitiveness of manufacturing and service
industry enterprises. Since the establishment of the NIES
in 1986, Victoria has contributed over
$60 million which is equivalent to the total contributions of
all other States. 
<P>
Business Victoria currently delivers a comprehensive and effective
suite of over 800 enterprise improvement services per year. These
services include diagnostics, business plans, Export Market Planning,
World Competitive Manufacturing, Total Quality Management and
detailed studies of key aspects of a firm's operations.
<P>
A delivery network which combines public and private sector skills
and experience has been specifically developed. This ensures the
network is responsive to the needs of business and is also aware
of the policy and regulatory characteristics of Government.
<P>
In addition to key industry sector specialists, the network includes
strategically located metropolitan and country offices which are
able to respond  to the State's regional development priorities.
This network will continue to provide a first point of contact
with Government, both State and Commonwealth, and is a key broker
of the whole range of Government assistance programs.
<P>
Business Victoria brings important skills, experience and
commitment to AusIndustry and is a major partner in the national
AusIndustry network. The Victorian Government increased the
budget allocation for enterprise improvement to well over $5 million
in 1994-95 to support:
