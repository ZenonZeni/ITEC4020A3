<h1><font SIZE=+4>Marijuana merits medical use</font> </h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Last year Gov. Pete Wilson made a mistake when he vetoed
a bill that would have allowed doctors to prescribe marijuana for patients
suffering from cancer, AIDS, glaucoma and a few other diseases. This year
the Assembly erred in failing to pass the same measure. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Fortunately, voters will have a say on the matter because
an initiative is likely to be on the November ballot. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The initiative does not legalize marijuana. It simply
allows medical doctors to use it to relieve suffering. Increasingly, physicians
are speaking out in favor of marijuana for numerous conditions. The drug
helps AIDS patients avoid weight loss and eases vomiting and pain associated
with chemotherapy. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>The California Medical Association has expressed support
for the use of marijuana if controlled studies prove it works. However,
such studies can take place only if the law allows them. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>Opponents of medical use of marijuana say it puts out
a message that the drug is harmless. That's nonsense, not worthy of consideration
by anyone interested in helping sick people. That's like concluding morphine
is considered harmless because it is prescribed by physicians. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+1>But the arguments sounded good enough to Assemblyman Richard
Rainey, who changed his vote from yes to no on the marijuana bill. Let's
hope the voters have more sense and allow doctors to use the drug where
and when it can do some good. </font></p>
