<H2>Instructions for Authors </H2>
Authors are encouraged to submit high quality, original work that has neither
appeared in, nor is under consideration by, other journals. The mission
of the JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS: Integrating Artificial
Intelligence and Database Technologies is to present research and development
focused on the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Database Management
technologies to provide models, architectures, tools and techniques for
the next generation of systems -- Intelligent Information Systems. The journal
focuses on the creation of information systems that exhibit intelligent
behavior and embody intelligence in their reasoning and management processes.
The journals is an archival, peer-reviewed, technical journal publishing
high-quality, state-of-the- art papers (*research papers *invited papers
*workshop and conference reports *survey and tutorial articles *book reviews)

<UL>
  <LI>Enclose a separate page specifying the title and giving the preferred
address of the contact author for correspondence and return of proofs. Please
include a telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address. 
  <LI>Enclose a brief biographical sketch for each author. 
  <LI>Authors should try to keep the length of the paper (including figures)
about 30 double-spaced pages (about 15,000 words).

<NL> <LI>Typeset (10pt font), double or 1 1/2 space; use one side of sheet
only (laser printed, typewritten and good quality duplication acceptable).
<LI>Use an informative title for the paper. <LI>List all authors, in the
form first name, middle initial, last name, followed by mailing address(es)
and email address(es). <LI>Include an abstract of 100 to 250 words at the
head of the manuscript. The abstract should be a carefully worded description
of the problem addressed, the key ideas introduced, and the results. <LI>List
from three to five keywords. Some typical keyword examples are: deductive
database, machine learning, user interface, adaptive systems, distributed
systems, and Petri nets. <LI>Provide a separate double-spaced sheet listing
all numbered foot-notes in order. Acknowledgement of financial support may
be given if appropriate. <LI>References should be complete and appear in
a separate bibliography at the end of the paper. They should be listed in
alphabetical order by authors names, with the year (possibly with a/b/...)

<PP   STYLE FOR ARTICLES: Author(s) last name followed by initials, for each
    author, year (possibly with a/b/c for multiple publications in one
     year, paper title, publication name, volume,  inclusive page numbers,

  <LI>... in (Lee & Shin,1991; Witkin, 1983), it is shown ...

  <LI>Type or mark mathematical expressions exactly as they should appear
in print. In word-processor manuscripts, use appropriate typefaces. Otherwise,
journal style and the corresponding indication for equations is as follows:
variables, italic type (indicated by underline); constants, Roman font type,
matrices and vectors, boldface type (indicated by wavy underline). It will
be assumed that letters in equations are to be set in italic type unless
you mark them otherwise. All letter symbols in text discussion must be marked
if they should be italic or boldface. 
</UL>
<H3>STYLE FOR ILLUSTRATIONS</H3>
<DIR>
  <LI>Originals for illustrations should be sharp, noise-free, and of good
contrast. We regret that we cannot provide drafting or art service. 
  <LI>Line drawings should be in laser printer output or in India ink on
paped. Use 8 1/2 X 11 inch size sheets if possible, to simplify handling
of the manuscript. 
  <LI>Each figure should be mentioned in the text, and numbered consecutively
using Arabic Numerals. Specify the desired location of each figure in the
text, but place the figure itself on a separate page following the text.
  <LI>Number each table consecutively using Arabic Numerals. Please label
any material that can be typeset as a table, reserving the term &quot;figure&quot;
for material that has been drawn. Specify the desired location of each table
in the text, but place the table itself on a separate page following the
text. Type a brief title below each table. 
  <LI>Provide a separate sheet listing all figure captions, in proper style
for the typesetter, e.g., &quot;Fig. 3. Examples of the fault coverage of
random vectors in (a) combinational and (b) sequential circuits.&quot; 
  <LI>All lettering should be large enough to permit legible reduction (at
least 10pt.). 
  <LI>Photographs should be glossy prints, of good contrast and gradation,
and any reasonable size. We will publish full color photographs, but only
with the authors understanding and acceptance that they will be expected
to finance the extra cost of the color reproduction. 
  <LI>Number each original lightly, in pencil, on the back so that they
may be matched up correctly with the Table and Figure locations in the text.

NOTE: JIIS final manuscripts should be preferably prepared using LaTeX macros
and submitted electronically. LaTeX macros can be accessed as follows: <BR>

</UL>
JIIS is a small journal as compared to a two-column large journal. So you
should &quot;mget smj*&quot; 
<H3>PROOFING</H3>

to the contact author for proofing, unless otherwise informed. The proofread
