Demonstrating conclusively that business today can capture the trust and
loyalty of the environmentally concerned consumer, <I>Environmental Marketing</I>
by Walter Coddington is filled with marketing strategies that help a company
promote and profit from its environmental products, technologies and stewardship.<BR>
<BR>
Offering step-by-step guidelines on a wide range of important issues, <I>Environmental
Marketing</I> examines the role of the marketer in the corporate environmental
improvement process, recommends proven environmental marketing strategies
and reports on ways to ensure that management is behind the environmental
marketing program.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, <I>Environmental Marketing</I> tells how to forge ties with
environmental advocacy groups; gives advice on developing high profile,
low risk advertising, promotion and public relations campaigns; and discusses
ways to negotiate the maze of federal, state and local &quot;green&quot;
guidelines and regulations.<BR>
<BR>
Walter Coddington is the founder of Coddington Environmental Management
and a pioneer in the integration of environmental concerns into the decision-making
process of today's socially responsible businesses.
