Dr. Jay M. Holder shows why chiropractic, acupuncture, and amino
acids may be the groundbreaking answer to the leading cause of
death in America. His bold new multifactorial approach has a high
success rate and is cost effective. It could spell the end to
addictions-to alcohol, cocaine, heroin, nicotine, gambling, attention
deficit disorders in adults and children-in a generation.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<P>
In the first days of its second century, chiropractic may have
a bold, effective, and inexpensive solution to the alarming problem
of addictions. An estimated 20% of the U.S. population suffers
from some form of addiction and over 80% of all crime is traceable
to addictions or substance abuse. Even more shocking, evidence
supports the conclusion that addiction, which most physicians
now regard as a disease, is the leading cause of death in America,
accounting for 69% of drownings, 68% of manslaughters, 49% of
murders, 50% of all traffic fatalities, and 35% of all suicides.
Add to this, deaths from drug overdose and related substance abuse
complications, and you have a health problem of staggering proportions.
<P>
Emerging in the face of these grim statistics is the completely
surprising revelation that the solution to this proliferation
of addictions may be in our own therapeutic backyard. According
to Jay M. Holder, D.C., M.D., Ph.D., a Miami chiropractor-physician
and one of the prime movers in the 50,000 member-strong chiropractic
profession, this 100-year-old primary health care profession may
hold the answer to addictions literally in its hands. Chiropractic,
after all, means &quot;done with the hands,&quot; and if the rest
of the profession grabs hold of Dr. Holder's theories and innovations,
chiropractic may start to make a profound difference in turning
around our most serious health problem in ways that nobody ever
thought it could.
<P>
Dr. Holder is no ordinary chiropractor. In 1991, he was the first
American physician to receive the Albert Schweitzer Prize in Medicine,
the profession's most prestigious award, to the acclaim of doctors
from 70 nations. That year he also was named Chiropractor of the
Year by the Florida Chiropractic Association. Dr. Holder received
Florida's first state grant to study the use of acupuncture to
treat chemical dependency. In 1992, the State of Florida House
of Representatives awarded Dr. Holder an official commendation
for his medical excellence in addiction treatment. 
<P>
In practice for 20 years, Dr. Holder directs two chiropractic
clinics, in Miami and Miami Beach, Florida, including the 300-bed
Exodus Addiction Treatment Center. He directs the Holder Research
Institute which invents medical devices, formulas, and educational
programs; he runs the American College of Addictionology and Compulsive
Disorders which trains and board certifies professionals to work
as addictionologists; and he travels, lectures, and teaches constantly.
<P>
Not only is he phenomenally busy, but Dr. Holder is getting unheard-of
clinical results in treating addictions. In 1993, the U.S. Senate,
reviewing Dr. Holder's success rates, said: &quot;In the realm
of addictionology, these figures compare with Michael Jordan's
performance in basketball.&quot;
<P>
So if a physician with this caliber of credentials says chiropractic,
as the leading component of a 5 part addiction treatment program,
can help addictions, we're well advised to give him an ear-both
ears. Here is a typical case that shows how Holder reverses addictions.
<P>
Johnny, age 26, came to Dr. Holder depressed, very sick, displaying
psychotic behavior, and strung out on alcohol and cocaine. He'd
already seen four psychiatrists who had given him different mood-altering
drugs, but they only made him worse. He'd started two addiction
treatment programs, but finished neither. Johnny had attended
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings but quit, finding them boring. He'd
go off drugs for a few weeks, maybe several months, then relapse,
and slip back into the habit.
<P>
Johnny's future didn't look promising. His parents refused to
pay for any more treatment programs, which were running $16,000
a month. The insurance companies had written him off as hopeless,
and if Johnny had gone to see any other physician besides Dr.
Jay Holder, chances are they'd have recommended he attend more
AA meetings and wished him well. 
<P>
The trouble is, this is most often the guarantee of a dead end,
which is why an estimated 35 out of 36 addicts never make it to
treatment, fair very poorly, and often die. The 1 out of 36 is
lucky enough to enter an addiction treatment program. A chronic
addict, Johnny was down and out, and likely to stay permanently
down. Of course, that's not the way Dr. Holder saw things.
<P>
After taking his case history, Holder began examining Johnny on
the treatment table. Using a unique diagnostic and chiropractic
treatment system called Torque Release Technique which Holder
co-developed with chiropractor Marvin A. Talsky, D.C., Holder
was able to tell which vertebrae in Johnny's spinal column were
out of alignment. Chiropractors call this condition a subluxation;
here any one of your spine's 33 vertebrae is partially dislocated.
But the concept has a deeper meaning for Dr. Holder. &quot;To
us, a subluxation means a separation from wholeness that interferes
with your body's ability to function in a whole way.&quot;
<P>
Every addicted person will have a subluxated spine with at least
one or more vertebrae out of alignment, Holder says. Using a handheld
spinal adjustment instrument he invented himself, called the Integrator&#153;,
Holder makes a few adjustments (never more than 3 in one visit)
on Johnny's spine, using a minimum of force and pressure. 
<P>
In addition to correcting Johnny's subluxations, Dr. Holder will
start him on a series of 4 amino acids (precursors to or building
blocks for proteins, normally found in foods) taken daily as oral
supplements. These include L-phenylalinine (750 mg daily), D-phenylalinine
(750 mg daily), l-glutamine (300 mg), and 
<P>
L-tyrosine (900 mg daily). 
<P>
If this were anywhere else than the U.S., Dr. Holder would also
give Johnny 400 mg of the amino acid L-tryptophan. Unfortunately,
although the substance's efficacy has been proven, the FDA forbids
its use in this country. Dr. Holder will keep Johnny on this amino
acid combination for at least a year. 
<P><A NAME="BRAIN"> </A>
The idea is that the chiropractic adjustment will remove the interference
to the natural flow of brain chemicals but you still need to shore
up the body's supplies of these substances, vital for addiction
recovery, for a fair amount of time. The amino acids will help
Johnny make important changes in his behavior, which are crucial
to the success of his treatment program and will help to guarantee
that he stays off drugs for good in the future. Specifically,
the amino acids, especially phenylalinine, the &quot;addiction-treatment
king,&quot; will help &quot;restore the brain reward cascade&quot;
(see below) and its bodywide sense of well-being; it will greatly
reduce stress and lift depression as well.
<P>
In addition, Johnny is attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings
every day and receiving expert addiction counselling at least
once a week, both of which are provided in Dr. Holder's clinic.
He may also receive some acupuncture treatment on his ears. &quot;We
integrate all 5 modalities for the best results,&quot; Holder
explains, &quot;but I emphasize that of all the modalities, the
one that offers the greatest benefit for the dollar invested is
chiropractic.&quot;
<P>
The next day, Dr. Holder adjusts Johnny again, and makes sure
he takes his amino acid capsules. On the third day, Johnny comes
in with his family. They can't believe the changes in his condition
and want to know what kind of miracle Dr. Holder has performed
on their son.
<P>
&quot;He doesn't yell or mope anymore,&quot; says Johnny's mother.
&quot;He has more attention, smiles frequently, even goes to work
on time,&quot; says his father. And Johnny says: &quot;I don't
cry at night any more and I no longer dream about my drug. My
drug appetite is completely gone. I feel no nagging to go back
and take some more cocaine.&quot;
<P>
Holder isn't surprised. He's seen results like this often with
many other chronically addicted people. &quot;Under chiropractic
care, they show a remarkable difference compared to any other
addiction treatment program. They become open, relaxed, and compliant
as their anxiety and depression lift. Their heads clear, their
thinking improves, they get in touch with their feelings, and
they open up to group therapy and the treatment program with a
surprising intensity.&quot; A couple of years later Johnny pays
Dr. Holder a visit. He's still off drugs and is getting married-and
he's never relapsed. 
<P>
There is, technically, no cure for addictions because, as the
saying goes, &quot;once a pickle, never a cucumber.&quot; Addiction
treatment experts, including Dr. Holder, speak in terms of recovery
and the ability to stay off drugs more or less permanently. So
there is the possibility of successful and long-lasting intervention
and recovery and Dr. Holder has put together the 5 elements that
produce these previously unheard-of results. In case you're wondering
if this is too good to be true, Dr. Holder has the statistics
to prove chiropractic can get results like this.
<P>
The key factor in addiction studies is how long an addicted person
will stay in the treatment program which typically runs 28 days.
Experts call this the retention rate. The national retention average
is 72%, which means out of 100 people in treatment, 28 will quit.
Those who finish the program stand an 85% chance of staying drugfree
5 years later. So if you can get more people to finish the program,
you basically come as close as possible to &quot;curing&quot;
them-Dr. Holder calls it &quot;securing an on going recovery&quot;-of
their addictions.  Dr. Holder knew he could improve the odds and
he did, by a great deal. 
<P><A NAME="EAR"> </A>
First, using acupuncture to treat six specific points on the ears,
Holder got the retention rate up to 96%. But even here, Dr. Holder
made an important contribution to the field of auriculotherapy,
or treating acupuncture points on the ear. Classical Chinese medicine
describes 5 ear points which can produce beneficial results in
treating all addictions. 
<P>
Then Dr. Holder, working with new information about the energetics
of the ear, identified 3 completely new treatment points, again
for all addictions. That new information has to do with the fact
that there are 4 cranial nerves that have nerve endings throughout
the ear and these are the points treated with needles. 
<P>
Before Dr. Holder refined his understanding of the contribution
subluxation-based chiropractic could make in addiction treatment,
he had been using ear acupuncture 100% of the time; now he uses
it with about 20% of his patients, when they need an extra energy
boost to lift their depression and cut drug appetite.
<P>
 
<P>
Ear acupuncture is excellent for helping to relax the patient,
which in turn allows addicted persons to be more compliant and
open to the complete therapy program. It also enables them to
feel less apathetic and more motivated to stay off drugs; further,
it cuts down on drug craving and reduces their sense of physical
and emotional withdrawal. 
<P>
What's innovative about Holder's use of auriculotherapy is that
he no longer uses the traditional needles. Instead he uses a Stim-Flex
400, which is a small handheld probe that delivers between 2.5-160
Hz in microcurrent to specific ear points for 8-16 seconds per
point, maximum. This is in comparison to needle-delivered ear
acupuncture which can require anywhere from 45-60 minutes. The
microcurrent probe approach is thus far more efficient and specific,
and helps release the pleasure-producing brain chemicals called
endorphins much more quickly and more thoroughly than needle treatment.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>So Holder was getting highly impressive results with his new developments
in ear acupuncture, but then he found something even better: chiropractic.
In a special trial with 100 addicts, when Holder gave them 20
chiropractic adjustments over a 30 day period, he got the retention
rate up to 100% &quot;</B></BLOCKQUOTE> 

That is unheard of; it's never happened
before in addiction treatment,&quot; Holder says. Bear in mind
that at a national average of only $30 per chiropractic adjustment,
this astounding success rate cost only about $600 per addicted
person per month. Add to this $30 for a one month's supply of
amino acids and $240-$400 a month for 4 addiction counselling
sessions, and you have a total addiction treatment program cost
of about $870-$1030. Johnny's unsuccessful treatment, by comparison,
had been costing his family $16,000 per month. 
<P>
Johnny's parents saw the results but, naturally, they couldn't
understand how chiropractic could have achieved it. The answer
is almost as startling as the treatment's success.
<P>
But you first have to define a few basic terms, says Holder, such
as what is addiction? &quot;Simply put, addiction is compulsive
use in spite of negative consequences.&quot; You keep using a
substance even though you know it's bad for you. There are 5 types
of addictions, including work, food, sex, drugs-chemicals, and
gambling, and each one has many factors. &quot;But these 5 categories
are all symptoms of one disease-addiction.&quot;
<P><A NAME="FLAW"> </A>
According to research Holder has collected and thought about deeply,
there are two key factorsat play in causing addictions. First,
according to Holder's colleague, Kenneth Blum, Ph.D. of the University
of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, there is a genetic
cause. 
<P>
Dr. Blum discovered the same specific genetic flaw (called &quot;the
A1 allele of the D2 dopamine receptor&quot;) in 69% of severe
alcoholics compared to only 20% of nonalcoholic people. 
<P>
It was Dr. Blum who developed the unique amino acid treatment
plan for addictions, as the result of 30 years of painstaking
research. &quot;Because the brain reward cascade is a linear sequence
of brain chemicals, Dr. Blum determined that certain intervention
approaches could help to balance this important function and produce
beneficial restorative effects,&quot; Dr. Holder explains. The
amino acids, in other words, are necessary precursors, or building
blocks, for the brain reward cascade chemicals (called neurotransmitters)
which are chronically deficient in the addicted person.
<P>
Second, according to Holder's research, an estimated 90% of babies
born through forcep or suction-cup assisted deliveries, arrive
in this world with a subluxation. If the infant has the genetic
defect associated with addiction and gets its spine dangerously
stretched and misaligned at birth, then the chances of becoming
an addicted adult are very high, Holder claims.
<P>
What's the connection between a subluxated spine and addictions?
It has to do with a precise sequence of chemical changes in your
brain called brain reward cascade. If this cascade goes well with
no interferences, you feel good, full of well-being and pleasure;
if the sequence is interfered with, you may start looking to mood-altering
substances or activities to fill the gap. These brain chemicals
are called neurotransmitters and they must be released in the
right sequence  (like falling dominoes) for you to feel good.

<P>
The biochemical bottom line here at the end of this cascade is
called dopamine, and, for those born with the genetic defect,
their dopamine will never work right. If your brain releases it,
you feel good. The dopamine reward may be the biochemical secret
to understanding addictions. 
<P>
When your spine is out of alignment, or subluxated, says Holder,
it interrupts this important biochemical sequence in your brain.
You start experiencing disturbing emotions and crave substances
to change, relieve, or suppress your feelings. But how does a
subluxation somewhere in your back interfere with the flow of
chemicals in your brain? This is where Holder's theory gets very
interesting.Your brain is not just in your head, but in your spine
as well.
<P>
Brain scientists explain that your emotions take place in the
midbrain (also called the limbic system). Your sense of well-being,
biochemically speaking, is seated in the limbic system. The brain
reward cascade takes place here. Now, the limbic system has outposts
throughout the spinal cord in little anatomical features called
the  &quot;dorsal horn,&quot; according to ground-breaking research
by the renowned scientist Dr. Candace Pert who discovered this
in 1988. In other words, your limbic system is represented throughout
the entire spinal cord.
<P>
This means if your spine is subluxated anywhere along its length,
this condition interferes with your limbic system and the flow
of feel-good chemicals in your head. If you are a person with
the specific genetic flaw associated with addictions, you will
probably never have that same feeling of self-contentment, pleasure,
and total well-being available to the rest of the nonaddicted
population. You may take up addictive substances or activities
to compensate.
<P><A NAME="ADHD"> </A>
There is yet another intriguing link. It turns out that children
who have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Tourette's
Syndrome, also have this identical genetic defect. In other words,
Holder explains, compulsive disorders affecting children is our
nations' number one pediatric complaint. They affect 5-8% of boys
and 2-4% of girls, and are highly similar in cause to addictions.
This also means that what successfully treats adult addictions
can be highly useful with hyperactive children. Holder proved
this by reversing abnormal brain waves in ADHD patients using
his Torque Release Technique.
<P>
The good news and the beauty of the approach is that when you
remove the addict's subluxation, as Dr. Holder did with Johnny,
you allow the brain reward cascade of feel-good biochemicals to
run properly again, perhaps for the first time in the person's
life. This in turn enables you to feel good and no longer seek
outside substances to produce a sense of well-being.
<P>
There are about 50,000 chiropractors practicing in America today.
This means that any addicted person or child with hyperactivity
who goes to a chiropractor who treats subluxations can probably
expect some immediate relief from their addicted or compulsive
behavior, Holder says. You might say that chiropractic gets the
dopamine flowing again, balancing the brain reward cascade. While
a chiropractor who removes subluxations will most likely help
an addicted person to start feeling better, you get even better
results by far if your chiropractor is trained in all the protocols
of  addictionology. 
<P>
If you go to a chiropractor trained in Dr. Holder's Torque Release
Technique (TRT) or to one who has graduated from Dr. Holder's
Certified Addiction Professional (CAP) program, you're likely
to get the best  results. &quot;Because addiction is a multifactorial
disease, you need a multifactorial approach to get the best results.
We consider TRT the 'faster car' for addiction treatment,&quot;
Holder says. Through his American College of Addictionology, Dr.
Holder is training health professionals all over the U.S. in a
120-hour Certified Addiction Professional program; he's also teaching
TRT to as many chiropractors as he can manage. 
<P>
The result is that chiropractic is poised to make a dramatic leap
forward in what they can offer the public as the nation's second
largest primary health care profession. As a leading modality
in alternative medicine, Holder says, chiropractic offers the
public something that conventional medicine cannot: a drugfree
addiction treatment program. Johnny never got better with the
drugs his psychiatrists prescribed because they were mood-altering
substances; they simply reinforced his addiction, making him dependent
on yet other chemical substances to feel better. 
<P>
&quot;This is the big news. We now have a bold new approach to
treating addictions that has a very high success rate and is highly
cost-effective. It works so well because it removes the interference
(the subluxation) to the brain reward cascade and allows you to
feel good about yourself,&quot; Holder says.
<P>
Dr. Holder is getting astonishing results in places where previously
no one dared to tread. This is the area of pregnant cocaine addicts.
Normally, women in this condition find no sympathy in America's
8000 addiction treatment programs on account of the staggering
insurance liabilities. Even worse, the local governments tend
to regard them as criminal child abusers and arrest them, severing
them from their children, and thus creating families that are
even more broken and dysfunctional.
<P>
The statistics are grim, says Dr. Holder, but there are some communities
in the U.S. today where 15% of all babies born are drug babies,
born to mothers who were addicted while carrying the fetuses.
In contrast, 15 years ago, this situation was unheard of, which
means the incidence of drug babies has been growing by 1% a year.
If this continues for another two generations, we could be looking
at a situation in which there are no normal babies born at all,
Dr. Holder says. This is why his was one of ten addiction treatment
programs that made a bold proposal to the federal government a
few years ago to take a new approach.
<P>
A colleague of Dr. Holder, Matthew Gissen, executive director
of Village Treatment Center, came up with an innovative concept
in treatment program design. The solution was what Drs. Holder
and Gissen call, affectionately, the &quot;pregnant mommie house.&quot;
This is a refitted 7-story building in Miami where addicted pregnant
women come for treatment. They have their babies and continue
the treatment program for up to 2 years-without the fear of arrest,
reprisal, or punishment for so-called child abuse. The approach
worked so well, says Dr. Holder, that today there are about 50
similar programs scattered around the U.S.
<P>
One day Dr. Holder walked into the pregnant mommie house. A young
woman grabbed his arm with a happy gleam in her eye. She brought
him into her room where she proudly displayed her healthy newborn
baby, barely a week old. She asked Dr. Holder to cradle her son
and share the moment, as this was truly a special, rare moment,
in which all the work of doctor and patient came to a happy resolution.

<P>
&quot;If you could just see the look in that mother's eyes, her
pride and self-esteem that she had experienced the miracle of
recovery, that she had accomplished something truly important
for her son,&quot; says Dr. Holder. There she was, a drugfree
mother with her drugfree newborn. The drug addiction would not
be passed on to the next generation, not with this mother. &quot;She
was actually realizing in that moment that she had conquered a
life-threatening disease and would not pass it on to her child-you
couldn't leave that room with a dry eye,&quot; Dr. Holder adds.
<P>
All of this leaves chiropractic looking pretty good on its 100th
anniversary. Acupuncturists get excellent results in treating
addictions but there are only 7000 of them for a population of
256 million. Conventional doctors can't successfully treat addictions
because there is no addiction training in medical schools and
doctors prescribe mood-altering drugs that can keep the addicts
addicted to substances and at risk to relapse.
<P>
&quot;Chiropractors are thus the logical primary intervention
resource to deal with the nation's number one cause of death,&quot;
says Holder. How this daring claim plays out in the the profession's
next 100 years remains to be seen, but nobody expects recovered
addicts like Johnny to argue the point.
<P>
&quot;Our program integrates five modalities-chiropractic, amino
acids, ear acupuncture, counseling, Alcoholics Anonymous-but I
emphasize that of all these, the one that offers the greatest
benefit for the dollar invested is chiropractic.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Holder adjusts a patient with the integrator<FONT SIZE=-2>[TM]</FONT>, a device
he invented to apply &quot;torque&quot; to remove subluxations.
<P>
Holder was getting highly impressive results with his new developments
in ear acupuncture, but then he found something even better-chiropractic.
In a special trial with 100 addicts, when Holder gave them 20
chiropractic adjustments over a 30 day period, he got the retention
rate up to 100%.
