<H3><B>Thigh High</B></H3><BR>

A thigh-reducing cream, once the stuff of hype and wishful thinking, has passed an experimental test.<P>

Peter Jaret reports on the breakthrough<P>

Rarely has a single brief scientific paper, delivered at an obscure research conference, ignited such a frenzy of publicity.  But when the subject is a cream that promises to make thigh fat melt away within weeks-- and when the results say it actually <I><B>works</B></I>--it's big news. <P>

<DD>In the study, presented at the North American Association for the Study of Obesity in Milwaukee in October, endocrinologist Frank Greenway of the University of California at Los Angeles and George Bray of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University selected twelve women who considered their thighs to be undesirably pudgy and dimpled.  The women applied a cream laced with a drug called aminophyllin<A HREF="vogue.htm"></A>e to one thigh.  An identical cream, but without the active ingredient, was applied to the other thigh.  At the end of six weeks, the thighs treated with aminophylline cream were measurably thinner than those treated with the inactive cream, some by more than half an inch in girth.  "We conclude that a 2 percent aminophylline cream applied topically causes regional fat loss from the thighs of women,"  the researchers announced.<P>

<DD>As the audience of some 400 obesity and weight loss experts spilled out of the conference room, Associated Press science editor Paul Raeburn, the only journalist in attendance, full expected to hear the usual scientific skepticism--that the results are preliminary, that further research is in order.  "Instead," says Raeburn, "everyone I talked to seemed in a hurry to get their hands on samples of the cream."<P>

<DD>Raeburn hurried to his typewriter. "Researchers Describe Cream That Shrinks Thighs," headlines declared the next day.  Within hours the news was being trumpeted far and wide, from local daily newspapers to national television.  A fat-loss lotion that really works! A miracle cream that melts stubborn fat off thighs!<P>

<DD>Can it be true?  As the hype dies down, a clearer view is emerging of a potentially valuable discovery that's far from new, a little less than revolutionary, and --alas--probably not all it's cracked up to be.<P>

<DD>Scientists have long known that aminophylline--and more than a dozen other substances, including caffeine--causes fat cells to burn fat, according to David Heber, professor of medicine and chief of clinical nutrition at UCLA and an internationally recognized expert on obesity and weight loss.  "Put fat cells in a culture dish with aminophylline and you can literally watch them release their stores of fat," says Heber.<P>

<DD>Aminophylline and other promising fat-loss drugs work by interfering with the action of hormones that normally regulate storage and release of fat.  Aminophylline is believed to block the receptor for an enzyme called adenosine, which otherwise inhibits fat cells from burning up their stored energy.  With the enzyme inhibitor out of the way, fat cells can mobilize their fat stores more easily, according to George Bray, who co-authored the highly publicized study and is a professor of medicine at Louisiana State University.<P>

<DD>One potential use of such drugs is for the treatment of clinical obesity.  Scientists are currently experimenting with several promising substances that, taken orally or by injection, may help stimulate the body to burn fat more readily.<P>

<DD>But what about applying the same fat-loss substances, in a cream or a lotion, directly to certain parts of the body where unwanted fat tends to settle?  Estrogen and progesterone produced during pregnancy trigger enzymes that remove fat from the bloodstream and tuck it away in fat cells in hips and thighs, where it's on hand to supply the more than 500 extra calories a day required to produce breast milk.  Because the need to feed our offspring is so crucial, fat cells in the thighs and hips are programmed to protect fat stores, even when other cells in the body burn theirs--one reason women who put on unwanted pounds during pregnancy find them devilishly difficult to shed later.  "Theoretically, at least, a substance applied locally could make it easier for those cells to burn stores of fat in hips and thighs," says Heber.<P>

<DD>Surprisingly, Greenway and Bray first announced promising results using a topical formulation of aminophylline cream more than six years ago.  "Local fat reduction from the thigh can be safely accomplished, "their little-noticed scientific paper in <I>Clinical Therapeutics</I> announced in 1987.  No one at the time, it sees, was listening.<P>

<DD>"The basic research into how cells store and release fat goes way back to the early 1960's," says Bray.  He and his colleagues first began to experiment with topical applications in 1978.  Since then, the aminophylline-cream formulation has been refined and further tested, according to Los Angeles--based physician and medical researcher Bruce Frome, who is collaborating with Bray and Greenway to make various thigh creams commercially available.<P>

<DD>"The real trick was creating a formula that allowed aminophylline to reach fat cells," says Frome, who directs the International Pain Research Institute in Los Angeles and has patented over a dozen medical inventions.  The compound had long been widely used to treat asthma, so doctors knew the substance was safe in very low concentrations.  Frome says its effectiveness had been suggested in 20 studies conducted over the past twelve years that showed that cream containing aminophylline, applied daily, reduces thigh girth in 80 percent of women who use it.<P>

<DD>But is it really melting away fat?  Aminophylline and related substances act as diuretics when taken internally, drawing fluid out of cells.  Some researchers caution that the thigh-thinning effect may be nothing more than water loss.  Others say we simply don't know enough about how aminophylline works on the skin.  "There's still no laboratory evidence that aminophylline cream actually penetrates the outer layers of the skin to reach fat cells," Heber insists.  "Nor do we know whether it can override all the other enzyme signals that control fat storage and release.  There are still many questions to be answered."<P>

<DD>Even if aminophylline cream <I>does</I> work as claimed, it would only make it easier for the body to draw on fat stored in the thighs.  The same overall amount of fat would be burned.  Fat stored in the upper arms, for instance, might increase in direct proportion to fat burned in the thighs and hips.  "The only way to lose overall weight is to decrease the amount of calories you eat or increase the energy you expend through exercise," says Heber.  "A thigh cream is not a formula for weight loss."<P>

<DD>Frome and Bray are even more cautious about the practical uses of aminophylline cream.  "True, the latest study showed a measurable reduction in girth.  But in my opinion that inch or so simply isn't significant," Frome admits. "Even trained observers weren't able to tell the difference."  There's no reason to think continuing use of the cream over time will drop even more inches from thighs.  "In cream form, the aminophylline only reaches effective concentrations in fat cells near the surface of the skin," Bray explains.  And the effect is temporary; once the cream was discontinued, the inches crept back on.  good old dieting and exercise, as Heber points out, are far more effective and long-lasting.<P>

<DD>The real value of aminophylline cream, according to Frome, will be in smoothing away unsightly "orange peel" appearance--so-called cellulite, which some researchers believe is caused when pockets of fat cells create bulges in the connective tissue of the thighs.  In a few women, Frome claims, dimpling and lumpiness disappeared after the first application of the cream.<P>

<DD>Surprisingly, several anticellulite creams already on the market contain a chemical relative of aminophylline called theophylline--although in far smaller concentrations than the 2 percent solution used in the research study.  "There's nothing miraculous about it," says Jack Mausner, Ph.D., senior vice president of research and development for Chanel cosmetics.  "Theophylline works as a diuretic, drawing water out of the cells and temporarily improving appearance."<P>

<DD>Frome admits that some creams now on cosmetics shelves contain a substance similar to his formulation.  But he says that they contain the wrong concentrations of the drug to have much effect or substances that counteract it.<P>

<DD>Obviously many women would pay handsomely for a cream that really does away with dimpled "orange peel" thighs.  They'll even pay good money for a product that simply <I>claims</I> it does.  Putting such claims to the test, unfortunately, won't be easy.  Wary of crossing the line between a cosmetic and a drug--thereby triggering the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration--cosmetics companies are reluctant to say too much about what  their products actually do in the body.  It's safe to claim that a product improves the appearance of cellulite-laden thighs; but if manufacturers say that an active ingredient causes fat cells to burn up their stores of energy, the formulation may be required to undergo extensive and expensive FDA drug testing.  Thus many cosmetics companies purposefully keep their claims vague.<P>

<DD>The result is a growing number of so-called cosmeceuticals--cosmetics that may actually be <I>more</I> effective than manufacturers are willing to say.  Add to that the fact that many lookalike products now crowd cosmetics shelves, and it's easy to see why choosing a product that really works isn't easy.<P>

<DD>The latest flap over aminophylline cream won't make the choice any easier.  Frome and his colleagues have signed agreements with three companies to produce their new cream won't make the choice any easier.  Frome and his colleagues have signed agreements with three companies to produce their new cream, including Herbalife and the Fight Solution, and the cream should be hitting the market now.  But even Frome readily admits that at least one of the companies has made changes in the formula that may make the product less effective.<P>

<DD>The good news is that a one-month supply of aminophylline thigh cream is expected to cost only about $30.  since most women in the highly touted study saw changes in the appearance of their thighs within three weeks, that's all you'll need to spend to find out whether the new cream really works.<P>

<DD>Chances are plenty of women will give it a try.  Two days after the research results made headlines, Frome had received more than 300 faxes from people who hoped to get samples.  In the end, women evaluating the results in the privacy of their own mirrors will decide whether this latest miracle lotion is just so much hype--or really something special.<P>
