<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>SUMMER ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>April 1995</b> </p>

<p>How to keep children &quot;busy&quot; and happy during the summer is
a dilemma that has faced parents since the demise of the neighborhood sandlot
and the ole swimmin' hole. &quot;What are the children going to do this
summer&quot; is a question that parents now ask long before summer arrives.
</p>

<p>The purpose of this Fact Sheet is to help parents find a program that
is suitable for their child. Traditional and nontraditional summer programs
are listed to allow a child opportunities for exploration of interests
and maybe the development of a hobby during summer vacation. </p>

<p>Some of the programs listed require collaboration between school districts
and other government agencies such as city or county parks and recreation
departments. The collaboration may be detailed in a formal Inter-Governmental
Agreement (IGA). A school district may provide a building or multi-purpose
room for a summer program, pay the utilities and provide custodial services.
The other agency, either city or county, may provide the trained staff
and special equipment. </p>

<p>If your school district does not have a summer program, you might be
able to start one for next summer by sending a formal request or a petition
to your district school board or committee. </p>

<p><b>Extended School Year (ESY)</b> provides a continuation of special
education and/or related services beyond a regular school year if the need
is documented in a student's IEP (Individualized Educational Program).
Key factors in determining eligibility for ESY are <i>regression</i> and
<i>recoupment</i>. <i>Regression</i> is a return to a lower level of functioning
in those skills or behaviors on the student's IEP. <i>Recoupment</i> is
the amount of time a student needs to regain the knowledge lost over a
period of time. </p>

<p>Review your child's IEP for the last few years to determine if reasonable
educational progress has been made in the goals and objectives following
interruptions in service due to illness, vacations, etc. If you think your
child may be eligible for ESY, ask for a review of placement and request
ESY services. </p>

<p>Some school districts provide ESY services a few weeks following the
end of the current school year. Others provide ESY services prior to the
beginning of the next school year. </p>

<p><b>Summer school</b> remedial or enrichment classes are offered by many
school districts or community schools. Some of these classes may be appropriate
for students with learning disabilities. Tuition or registration fees are
usually charged. School-parent groups or educational enrichment foundations
frequently allocate money to assist families in paying summer school fees.
Some SEAs (State Education Agencies) require students below a certain achievement
level to attend summer school. </p>

<p><b>Private schools or learning centers</b> offering specialized instruction
to students with learning disabilities, learning differences or language
development deficits are available in many cities. These facilities charge
fees for services, sometimes on a sliding scale. </p>

<p>Check listings in the yellow pages of your phone book under headings
such as <i>Schools-Academic-Secondary and Elementary</i> or <i>Schools-Academic-Special
Education</i>. Your local or state LDA affiliate, <i>The Directory of Facilities
and Services for the Learning Disabled</i> (Academic Therapy) or <i>The
Complete Learning Disabilities Directory</i> (Grey House) may be of help
in locating a school or center. </p>

<p><b>Universities or colleges</b> sometimes have specialized summer classes
for high school students with learning disabilities. The classes usually
allow for the earning of college credits while becoming familiar with the
college environment and participating in specially structured programs.
Check with the disabled student resource center at your local college or
university. <i>Summer PreCollege Programs for Students with Learning Disabilities</i>
may be obtained from HEATH Resource Center, One Dupont Circle, Ste. 800,
Washington, D.C. 20036-1193, (202) 939-9320 or (800) 544-3284. </p>

<p>Various departments or colleges within a university system may offer
specialty camps in astronomy, chemistry, computers, math or science. </p>

<p>Many colleges and universities offer residential and day sport camps
(tennis, basketball, baseball, football and soccer) with college sport
stars in attendance. One major university is offering a month-long Sports-0-Rama
through their School of Health Related Professions, Department of Exercise
and Sport Sciences. Contact the sports information office at your local
college or university for more information on offerings in your area. </p>

<p><b>Libraries</b> have traditionally offered summer reading programs.
If your child has a reading or comprehension disability, ask if he/she
can participate in the program through taped children's books or if you
can read the books to the child. </p>

<p>The need for expanded services and community outreach has increased
the scope of programs offered at many libraries: orientation classes for
using the library; story hours for children and for families; programs
in music, art, history and travel; and specialty classes. </p>

<p>One major library system is offering a junior high/middle school survival
course for students and their parents, in separate sessions. The classes
deal with organizational skills, coping with class schedules, peer pressures
and development/maturity issues. </p>

<p><b>Recreational programs</b> offered by school districts in conjunction
with city or county parks and recreation departments are available in many
parts of the country. Games, team and individual sports, table games, arts
and crafts, dancing, environmental studies and special events make up the
usual programs. </p>

<p><b>Specialized day-camps</b> offered by therapeutic recreation units
of parks and recreation departments provide recreation programs for students
with disabilities. Day camps for children and pre-teens, teen social groups,
weekend outings, dances, special events, hiking and swimming classes are
routinely offered. </p>

<p>The day camps are sometimes co-sponsored by school districts through
an IGA. Frequently the day-camps are offered at no cost to the parents
since municipal or county tax dollars fund the programs. </p>

<p>Many day-care centers offer day-camp experiences for children up to
about age 10. Athletic and fitness clubs also offer recreation programs
for students, many times with reduced rates for multiple children in a
family. </p>

<p><b>Museums and zoos</b> may have summer programs within their specialty
areas. Some art museums offer classes in cartooning, ceramics, drawing,
painting, photography and sculpture. Some historical museums help children
develop an understanding of the history of their immediate area or state
through hands-on lessons. </p>

<p><b><i>A Directory of Summer Camps for Children with Learning Disabilities</i></b>
can be obtained from the Learning Disabilities Association of America for
$5.25. Your local or state LDA affiliate may also be able to provide information
on residential summer camps. </p>

<p>If you consider a residential camp, it's wise to include the child in
the decision. You may want to ask the camp for a local reference so that
your child can talk with another camper and you can discuss your concerns
with the parent. Factors you may want to consider are: the training of
the staff in working with children with learning disabilities, the structure
of the program, the opportunity for a child to maintain skills in reading,
the dispensing of medication, accessibility of medical treatment, how discipline
is handled and staff to camper ratio. </p>

<p><b>Cooperative &quot;intern&quot; arrangements</b> with friends or understanding
neighbors are especially good in more remote areas. Each parent agrees
to take the other's child for a particular period of time to teach a skill:
cooking, pet grooming, child-care, computers, wood working, horsemanship,
etc. A child might be able to develop several different skills during the
summer and have fun too! </p>

<p><b>Miscellaneous opportunities</b> for recreation and training are available
through organized sports programs (Little League); Boys and Girls Clubs;
Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts; Campfire; the Salvation Army; YMCAs and YWCAs;
hospital volunteer activities (Candy Stripers); computer camps; specialized
skills camps such as boating, swimming, archery, tennis, and horseback
riding; trail building and maintenance with the U.S. Forest Service; the
exploration of interests and hobbies; and, volunteer activities working
with younger children or seniors. </p>

<p>Have fun and have a great summer! </p>
