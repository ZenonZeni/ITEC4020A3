AIR FORCE RENEWS $170 MILLION CONTRACT WITH ITT

ANNAPOLIS CAPITAL (APR 1) -- IIT Research Institute, with 700, has been
awarded an Air Force contract renewal worth up to $170 million over the next
three years.
   The contract, for work done entirely in Annapolis, extends a mission
performance since 1961 by the Chicago-based company.
   IIT supplies engineering support to a defense department project at the
Severn River Naval Complex.
   Edward Jackson, IIT vice president, said the company found out at 4 pm
(2100 GMT) Friday about the sole-bid award, to be enacted in July.
Essentially, it means business as usual in Annapolis.
   The contract does not guarantee $170 million, but authorizes up to that
amount.  Jackson said about 200 projects a year must be approved
individually.

ARMED CONTRAS SLIPPING BACK INTO NICARAGUA

MANAGUA, Nicaragua (MAR 31) AP -- The Sandinista party newspaper said
Saturday that at least 1,000 armed Contra rebels have slipped back into
Nicaragua from Honduras, and it claimed they were preparing to wage
full-scale war.
   The military said nine Contras had been killed and 13 government soldiers
wounded in a series of new clashes.
   Contra representatives signed an agreement with Nicaragua's incoming
government to disband by April 20, five days before the new administration of
the United National Opposition takes over from the leftist Sandinistas.
   Despite that March 23 pact, rebel leaders have said their forces were
taking their weapons as they moved from jungle camps in neighboring Honduras
back into Nicaragua.
   Contra leaders said last week that nearly all 12,000 of the rebels in the
camps had returned home.
   Contra rebels interviewed by The Associated Press earlier in the week said
they would not turn over their arms until they are convinced the government
of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is in control of the nation's
security forces.

ATTEMPTS FAIL TO FREE US SERGEANT IN NETHERLANDS

UTRECHT, Netherlands (APR 1) AP -- Dutch prison guards foiled an attempt by
12 Americans, including several servicemen, to seize a US Air Force sergeant
imprisoned on charges of killing his wife, television reports said Sunday.
   Television reports said the incident occurred Friday after the Dutch High
Court ruled that Sergeant Charles Donald Short could not be extradited to the
United States to stand trial on the murder charges.
   The 12 US citizens, including several members of the US Air Force, were
waiting in several cars with US license plates outside a jail in the central
Dutch city of Utrecht, the television said.  Short was due to return there
from the High Court ruling in The Hague, 37 miles away, according to the
report.
   The television report quoted Short's unidentified defense attorney as
saying the Americans were trying to mount "a little Panama."  It was a
reference to the US invasion of that nation in December to topple dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Short was arrested on April 1, 1988, and accused of killing his
Turkish-born wife, cutting her body into pieces and dumping the remains in
plastic bags in Monnikendam, 56 miles from the US Air Force base at
Soesterberg.  He was serving there with the 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron.

BRIEF STALEMATE IN LEBANON ENDS WITH RENEWED FIGHTING ON MONDAY

BEIRUT, Lebanon (APR 2) AP -- Rival Christian forces clashed with artillery
and tanks in east Beirut and mountains to the northeast Monday, setting fuel
tanks ablaze in an inferno that threatened a liquor factory's alcohol stocks.
   The fighting in the city's Christian sector and fog-shrouded Kesrouan
highlands broke out around midnight, shredding a cease-fire brokered by
Vatican-backed mediators only a few hours earlier.
   One person was wounded by sniper fire in the fighting between rebel
General Michel Aoun's 19,000 troops and the Lebanese Forces militia led by
Samir Geagea, a police report said.
   At least 839 people have been killed and 2,290 wounded since Jan 30, when
Aoun attacked the militia in a bid to crush the main challenge to his
authority in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Police said both sides pounded each other's positions with 155-mm
howitzers, tanks and multi-barreled rocket launchers in the latest flare-up.

BRITAIN ANNOUNCES LIFTING OF MILITARY SECURITY ZONE

LONDON (MARCH 30) - Britain will lift on Saturday the (150 nm) military
exclusion zone it enforced around the Falkland Islands after the 1982 war
against Argentina, the foreign office announced Friday.
   The zone will cease to exist at 1600 GMT Saturday, the foreign office
said.
   A decision to lift the restriction around the islands in the south
Atlantic was taken when officials from Britain and Argentina met in Madrid
two months ago, but no date had been set.
   The security of the island group will be maintained by measures drawn up
by the two governments.

CHINESE POLICE TIGHTEN CONTROL OVER TIANANMEN SQUARE

BEIJING (APRIL 1) UPI -  Police cordoned off most of Tiananmen Square until
dusk Sunday and fire trucks with water cannons stood by as authorities braced
for signs of a revival of last year's crushed pro-democracy movement.
   "This just proves how terrified the leadership is," a Chinese official
said.
   The extraordinary security precautions came days after the government
issued a document warning Beijing citizens to avoid Tiananmen Square from
April 1 to June 4, a two-month span encompassing a series of sensitive
anniversaries marking the rise and then the bloody dismantling of last
spring's protest movement.
   The 100-acre square was the site of student-led protests by hundreds of
thousands of people.
   Government fears of renewed unrest during the first anniversary of the
protests and their bloody suppression have been heightened by recent fax
messages and letters sent to Beijing offices by overseas dissidents who fled
China after last June.
   The faxes urged Beijing residents to "take walks" through Tiananmen Square
beginning April 1 to protest the killing of hundreds, perhaps thousands, when
the army opened fire on demonstrators last June 3-4.

CUBA SENDS ADVISERS IN NICARAGUA HOME

WASHINGTON TIMES (APR 2) -- Cuban advisers are leaving Nicaragua, abruptly
ending Fidel Castro's heavy investment in the outgoing Sandinista government.
   Fifty military advisers and about 300 medical and construction personnel
remain, according to a US official who asked not to be named.
   Mr. Castro announced an end to military cooperation with Nicaragua after
the landslide defeat of his Marxist proteges by an opposition coalition led
by Violeta Chamorro.
   By the time President-elect Chamorro takes office April 25, "you're going
to see all of the military and clandestine types gone," the official said.

DISCOVERY OF SOVIET MISSILES SIDETRACKS ARMS-CONTROL EFFORTS

WASHINGTON TIMES (APR 2) -- The discovery is Eastern Europe of Soviet-made
intermediate-range missiles banned by treaty is complicating US efforts to
conclude new arms-control accords, according to Bush Administration
officials.
   The SS-23 Spider missiles in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria,
combined with a recent dispute over on-site inspection in the Soviet Union,
will make it harder to develop a verification regime for strategic and
conventional arms-control treaties, said US officials who asked not to be
named.
   The Czechoslovaks have said their 72 missiles will be dismantled by the
end of the summer, officials said.  But the Bulgarian government recently
told the United States in a diplomatic note that it will keep its 24 INF
missiles, unless the Americans would like to negotiate the dismantling of the
arms.  Bulgaria is not a party to the INF treaty.

DOCTOR HURT AS AIR NATIONAL GUARD HELICOPTER IS SHOT

ALTONA, NY (MARCH 30) UPI - Gunfire from a Mohawk Indian encampment struck a
Vermont Air National Guard helicopter on an emergency medical evacuation
mission Friday, wounding a doctor and forcing the chopper to land in a field.
   The UH-1 "Huey" helicopter from the Delta 150th Aviation Batallion was
forced down about 11:20 am and made a "controlled landing," a State Police
spokesman said.
   Five people - three military personnel, the doctor and a nurse - were
aboard the helicopter.  The helicopter was heading to Massena Memorial
Hospital to pick up a seriously ill patient, officials said.
   The wounded doctor was shot in the arm and was reported in stable
condition at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont in Burlington,
authorities said.
   Mohawks in upstate New York have been feuding with the state and federal
government since July, when State Police and the FBI raided a number of
casinos on the St. Regis Indian Reservation about 100 miles west of the
encampment.

'DON'T PULL OUT OF EUROPE' GROUP OF EXPERTS WARNS

WASHINGTON TIMES (APR 2) -- A group of prominent American defense experts and
politicians yesterday cautioned Congress against pressing for unilateral
troop cuts in Europe before the implementation of a conventional arms treaty
in 1992.
   While US armored troops could go home after the treaty is signed, the
group suggested, over the long term the United States should maintain a
military presence in Europe focused on intelligence, planning, command, and
logistics with the ability to return troops in a hurry if necessary.
   "The bottom line is that we say `Don't pull out of Europe,'" said former
Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, a co-author of the interim report on
"Changing Roles and Shifting Burdens in the Atlantic Alliance," sponsored by
the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute and the Paul H. Nitze School of
Advanced International Studies.

EAST GERMAN SOLDIERS START SEARCH FOR STALIN VICTIMS

ORANIENBURG, East Germany (MARCH 30) UPI -  East German soldiers Friday
started exhuming bodies from a mass grave thought to contain the remains  of
several hundred victims of Stalinist executions.
   The soldiers had volunteered for the grisly task at the Oranienburg site
of a former Soviet prisoner of war camp, one of several that recently have
come to public attention in East Germany.  The Soviets are thought to have
used the camps to hold any German considered a security risk.
   Bones and skeletons as well as rusty identity tags and bullet cartridges
were discovered shortly after the digging began at the site just north of
East Berlin.
   Between 1939 and 1950, 130,000 prisoners passed through security camps,
first ran by the Nazis and later taken over by the occupying Red Army, in
what is now East Germany.  An estimated 65,000 people are believed to have
been killed in the camps, many of them average citizens who were denounced by
their neighbors.
   Other mass graves believed to contain the remains of at least 2,000
victims were discovered earlier this week at a camp near the East German
town of Neubrandenburg.

FRENCH COMBAT BUILDUP IN CHAD "IMPLICIT WARNING" TO LIBYA

PARIS (MARCH 31) UPI - France is sending 15 more combat aircraft and
additional troops to eastern Chad as an "implicit warning" to Libyan leader
Colonel Moammar Gadhafi to halt attacks by his forces on Chadian President
Hissene Habre's troops, Defense Ministry sources said Saturday.
   The warplanes together with transport aircraft and support troops are
being deployed from French bases at the Chadian capital of Ndjamena and Bouar
in the Central African Republic, the sources said.
   France currently has about 1,000 troops stationed in Chad.  But only 100
of these are based in the east of the country in the city of Abeche, some 150
miles southeast of the Sudanese border.
   Fighting broke out in the area a week ago between Chadian troops and about
2,500 members of the "Islamic Legion," a Libyan-backed force consisting
partly of mercenaries and led by the rebel Chadian commander Idriss Deby from
a base in Sudan.
   Libya has denied any involvement in the fighting.  Forces loyal to Habre
carried out a series of raids into Sudanese territory against the rebels in
October and November.

NAVY HORNET CRASHES INTO MEDITERRANEAN, BUT PILOT LIVES

GAETA, Italy (APR 1) AP -- A US Navy jet crashed in the western Mediterranean
during routine operations, but the pilot was quickly rescued, a 6th Fleet
spokesman said Sunday.
   The F-18 Hornet, operating from the USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER (CVN 69), was
flying about 28 miles from the NIMITZ-class aircraft carrier when it went
down Saturday afternoon.
   An SH-3 Sea King helicopter operating in the area recovered the pilot
within 10 minutes and returned to the carrier.
   The pilot, whose name was not released, was in stable condition.  The
extent of his injuries was not immediately known.  The cause of the accident
was under investigation.

ONGOING VIOLENCE IN INDIA LEAVES ONE DEAD, 14 INJURED

SRINAGAR, INDIA (APRIL 1) UPI -  Separatist violence Sunday in the troubled
Kashmir city of Srinagar left a security force officer dead and at least 14
people injured, police and witnesses said.
   Police said one of two militants appeared from a side street in the city's
Khanauar district and threw a grenade at a Central Reserve Police Force
patrol, killing one officer instantly.
   Others in the patrol fired at the militants but missed and injured 10
bystanders, police said.
   Six bystanders in the area were arrested but police gave no reason for the
action.
   In a separate incident, witnesses said members of the reserve police
opened fire in the Nawpora area of town, injuring at least four people.
Police confirmed the report but could not say what prompted the incident.
   The unrest in Srinagar, the Jammu and Kashmir state summer capital 400
miles north of New Delhi, occurred during a six-hour relaxation in the curfew
that began at 5 am.
   The separatist campaign, aimed at forcing India to allow Kashmir to become
independent, is supported by virtually all of the area's 3 million Moslems.

POLISH DIPLOMAT AND WIFE WOUNDED BY UNKNOWN MOSLEMS IN BEIRUT

BEIRUT, Lebanon (MAR 31) AP -- Assailants Friday wounded a Polish diplomat
and his wife, and a previously unknown Moslem group Saturday claimed
responsibility and warned Poland not to help Soviet Jews travel to Israel.
   The shootings followed Poland's offer to help Soviet Jews emigrating to
Israel as a "humanitarian gesture" that it hoped Arab nations would
understand.
   Budgan Zbigniew, a Polish commercial attache, and his wife, Eva Sarkis,
were wounded by assailants firing automatic rifles as the couple was parking
a car near the Bristol Hotel in Moslem west Beirut.
   The two were rushed to the American University Hospital, where a hospital
spokesman Saturday said both were "doing fine.  They are off the critical
list."  A hospital medical bulletin said Zbigniew had a bullet wound in the
chest and his wife suffered minor wounds in the left arm.
   The Polish government condemned the attack and said the Foreign Ministry
was taking increased measures to protect diplomats and other overseas
employees.
   The claim of responsibility came in a handwritten Arabic statement from
the Revolutionary Action Organization, the Arab Resistance front--The Martyr
Suleiman al-Halabi unit, published by the Beirut leftist newspaper As-Safir.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE LEAVES ONE DEAD, 4 INJURED IN GREECE

ATHENS (APRIL 1) - Fighting between members of two rival Greek political
parties left one person dead and four wounded on the southern island of Crete
on Sunday a week before a general election, police said.
   Manolis Yakoumakis, 37, died after being shot in the head near the
island's capital Iraklion, while four other people, including a journalist,
were  hospitalized with bullet wounds.
   The dead man and three of the wounded belonged to the conservative New
Democracy party (ND).  A fourth victim was a member of former Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou's PASOK socialist party.
   The clash erupted shortly after ND chairman Constantin Mitsotakis arrived
to make a campaign speech.
   The violence began when conservative militants attacked PASOK headquarters
in Alikarnassos, a suburb of the capital, and shot a party member in the leg.

REBELS SHOOT DOWN TWO AFGHAN HELICOPTERS

ISLAMABAD (APRIL 1) - Afghan guerrillas have shot down two transport
helicopters near southern Kandahar city, killing five crew members,
resistance sources said Sunday.
   The helicopters crashed in the Daman area, 15 kilometers (9 miles) east of

Afghanistan's second largest city, after they were fired on by US-made
Stinger missiles, the pro-resistance Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) reported.
   Quoting a local rebel leader, AIP said the helicopters had been returning
to Kalat after transporting food and other consumer goods to Kandahar.
   It said rebel mujahedeen had recovered the bodies of five crew members
from the wreckage.

SOVIETS ADD TO FORCES IN LITHUANIA

WASHINGTON POST (APR 2) -- MOSCOW, APR 1 - The Kremlin reinforced its
military presence in Lithuania today, hours after President Mikhail Gorbachev
issued a tough statement calling on the rebel republic to rescind its
declaration of independence.
   Lithuanian government leaders, meanwhile, said they were ready for talks
with Moscow on any issue, including Soviet security interests in the Baltic,
but that they would not revoke their March 11 proclamation of independence.
The Lithuanian parliament is to meet Monday to discuss Gorbachev's appeal.
   The Kremlin has already dispatched a paratroop regiment to Lithuania,
together with several units of internal security troops.  Over the past week,
Soviet soldiers have been posted at the office of the chief Lithuanian
prosecutor, the main printing works and several Communist Party buildings.

SRI LANKAN LEADER RETURNS IN TRIUMPH OVER INDIA

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (APRIL 1) UPI -  One week after the last of 50,000 Indian
troops withdrew from Sri Lanka, the leader of the victorious Tamil Tiger
guerrillas said Sunday that his fighters will not lay down their arms and
will continue the struggle of the Tamil-speaking people.
   Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran returned in triumph to Nallur in
northern Jaffna peninsula two years after the skin of his pet leopard was
displayed as a war trophy by Indian troops, who drove his 4,000 guerrillas
into Sri Lanka's jungles but failed to disarm or pacify them.
   "We have fought and defeated the (world's) fourth-largest army.  We have
shown the world by defeating the Indian army. No one can crush us,"
Prabhakaran said at a news conference in the northern peninsula, now
virtually under complete control of the Tigers.  We are not against the
Indian government or the people, but we are against the atrocities carried
out by the Indian army," he said.

STALEMATE HALTS FIGHTING BETWEEN CHRISTIAN FORCES

BEIRUT, Lebanon (APRIL 1) UPI - A cease-fire agreement and a stalemate
Sunday ended two days of fierce clashes between rival Christian forces
northeast of Beirut that killed at least 50 people and wounded 110.
   Police said sporadic machine gun and mortar fire echoed across the village
of Qlaiat, where troops under General Michel Aoun and the rival militiamen of
Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces engaged in bloody battles Friday and Saturday.
   Qlaiat is a strategic village controlled by Aoun's troops in the Christian
Maronite heartland of Kesrouwane, 12 miles north of Beirut, an area that is
largely a Lebanese Forces militia stronghold.
   Police said big guns fell silent along the 4-mile front in Kesrouwane late
Saturday after a Christian mediation team managed to persuade the two rival
leaders to hold their fire.
   Military sources said Geagea had launched attacks against Aoun's positions
in Qlaiat with the aim of driving him out of Kesrouwane.  They said Geagea
wanted to distract Aoun from attacking his militia headquarters in east
Beirut.
   More than 50 people were killed and 110 were wounded in two days, raising
the casualty toll in two months to 850 dead and 2,820 wounded.
   Military sources said around 1,000 troops, backed by tanks, armored
personnel carriers and relentless shelling from 200 artillery pieces,
confronted a similar militia force with the same fire power.

SUDAN SOLDIERS KILL 112 REBELS

KHARTOUM, Sudan (MAR 31) AP -- Soldiers and their allied militiamen killed
112 rebels in fierce fighting in southern Sudan, the military command
reported.
   A statement issued late Friday also said nine soldiers and militiamen were
killed and 32 wounded in the fighting in southern Sudan's sprawling Bahr
el-Ghazal region. It did not say when the battles took place.
   In addition to the 112 rebels killed, a "large number" were wounded, the
statement said.  The military also said the rebel unit's commander was
captured.  The militiamen are part of a newly formed popular defense force
made up of civilian volunteers armed by the government to fight the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   It was impossible to verify the government statement because the south has
been closed to outsiders for years due to the rebellion.

TWO SENATORS WANT TOUGHER STANCE ON NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION

WASHINGTON (APRIL 1) UPI - Two senators said Sunday it is time to get tough
on the proliferation of nuclear weapons overseas, particularly in light of
the recent attempt to ship potential bomb triggers to Iraq.
   Senator William Cohen (R-Maine) ranking Republican on the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, said the United States should be as hard on Iraq
as it is on Libya when it comes to weapons proliferation.
   "I think we should.  I think that's precisely the case," Cohen said on
ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley" program.
   Cohen suggested using economic sanctions to block the expansion of nuclear
weapons.
   Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, echoed Cohen's opinion.
   "I think we need to get tough, not just with those Middle Eastern
countries, but with those who are supplying them. ... I think we need to  use
strong diplomatic measures with those folks who are in the business of
supplying these weapons," said Bingaman.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations disputed the senators' position.

US COAST GUARD SEIZES COCAINE BOAT FOR SPAIN

MIAMI (APRIL 1) UPI -  A US Coast Guard boarding team acting on behalf of the
Spanish government seized a Spanish fishing vessel carrying at least 185
pounds of cocaine and held the crew, the Coast Guard said Sunday.
   The seizure was made Friday in international waters about 250 miles
southeast of Puerto Rico, but was not made public until after the vessel
reached Puerto Rico Sunday.
   A Coast Guard law enforcement team aboard the USS SOUTH CAROLINA (CGN 37),
a US Navy CALIFORNIA (CGN 36)-class cruiser, spotted the crew of the Spanish
ship TERRAL throwing bundles into the ocean.
   The Navy crew and the Coast Guard team recovered the bundles and found
them to contain 185 pounds of cocaine.
   The United States notified the government of Spain, which authorized the
seizure of the ship and asked the Coast Guard to detain the crew.
   The TERRAL and its crew of 10 Spanish citizens were escorted to San Juan,
Puerto Rico Sunday by the Coast Guard Cutter CHILULA (WMEC 153).  They were
turned over to the jurisdiction of the Spanish consulate in Puerto Rico, and
were being held by US immigration authorities pending transfer to Spain for
prosecution.
   It was unclear who was to pick up the floating bundles of cocaine.

US WEIGHS CHANGES IN PLANS TO PRODUCE SHORT-RANGE NUCLEAR WEAPONS

WASHINGTON POST (APR 2) -- The Bush administration is considering changes in
its plans for production of more short-range nuclear weapons for deployment
in Western Europe in order to respond to opposition from West Germany and key
US legislators, US and diplomatic sources said yesterday.
   The officials said several alternatives to the highly controversial weapon
plan are being discussed with US allies in preparation for a meeting of
defense ministers from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
Alberta, Canada, early next month.
   The administration's aim is to win allied approval for a new approach that
would halt widespread criticism of its request for $112 million in fiscal
1991 to develop a short-range nuclear missile, plus additional funds for
nuclear-tipped battlefield artillery shells.

VMI'S NEW CHIEF DEFENDS MALE-ONLY ENROLLMENT POLICY

WASHINGTON TIMES (MAR 30) -- LEXINGTON, VA - Maj General John W. Knapp made a
camouflaged defense of Virginia Military Institute's male-only admissions
policy during his inauguration as superintendent yesterday, but called the
outcome of a sex-discrimination lawsuit unpredictable.
   General Knapp was flanked by 1,300 cadets in their gray-and-white dress
uniforms and backed by the board of visitors as he said VMI's single-sex
education designed to mold citizen-soldiers holds "a special place" in
Virginia's diverse system of higher education.
  In a separate interview, General Knapp said allowing women would ruin the
uniqueness of the VMI experience, a single-sex education where a rigorous
physical and mental indoctrination is used to reinforce male bonding.

HONDURAN MILITARY PLEDGES TO FIND ATTACKERS OF US SOLDIERS

TEGUCIGALPA (APRIL 1) REUTER - Honduran Armed Forces pledged on Sunday to
launch a manhunt for gunmen who strafed a bus full of US airmen with
machine-gun fire, leaving seven wounded, two seriously.
   A US Embassy spokesman said the US military has been receiving constant
threats against servicemen temporarily stationed in Honduras, but he denied
there had been a warning about Saturday's attack.
   At least three suspected leftist guerrillas opened fire with machine guns
as the bus was returning 28 temporary duty Air Force personnel from a
pleasure trip to the Atlantic coast beach.  The attack on the Air Force bus
occurred about 12 miles (20 km) north of Tegucigalpa.
   Two of the injured were in critical, but stable, condition on Sunday
morning after surgery in a Tegucigalpa hospital.
   US Embassy spokesman Terence Kneebone said the two would be flown back to
the United States when possible.  Another spokesman said four of the injured
had been flown to an army hospital in Panama City and one was recovering at
the Soto Kano airbase in Palmerola, some 50 miles (80 km) north of
Tegucigalpa, where most US military personnel in Honduras are based.
   The Pentagon maintains some 1,200 troops on regular duty in Honduras, but
the number is often boosted by troops on short-term civic action duties and
military exercises.

SEVEN US SOLDIERS WOUNDED IN REBEL ATTACK ON HONDURAN BUS

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (MARCH 31) UPI - Rebels of the leftist Morazanist
National Liberation Front opened fire Saturday on a bus carrying 28 US
soldiers, wounding seven, including three seriously, Radio America reported.
   The bus left the US Palmerola military base bound for Tegucigalpa, 53
miles to the south, but leftist rebels intercepted the bus about 12 miles
from the city, Radio America said.
   The rebels fired at least 10 shots into the vehicle about 1 pm (1900 GMT),
damaging the engine and wounding seven soldiers, the radio said.
   Radio America said the seven wounded soldiers, including three in serious
condition, were immediately taken to Tegucigalpa's Escuela Hospital, where
they were treated.
   The broadcast said five of the wounded were later transferred to the
Palmerola base, while two were still under observation at Escuela Hospital.
   Radio America quoted a doctor there saying the victims arrived at the
hospital at 1:30 pm and that one of them was undergoing surgery to  remove
bullets from his head and chest.

COUP ROW DELAYS PHILIPPINE BASE TALKS

WASHINGTON TIMES (APR 2) -- MANILA - Talks on the future of US military bases
in the Philippines, already twice postponed, face new delays amid claims that
an American was involved in last December's army coup attempt against
President Corazon Aquino.
   US Ambassador Nicholas Platt said the talks would not take place as
scheduled in mid-April but declined to elaborate, saying only that "we need a
little more time," Mr. Platt denied he had any connection with an American
implicated by a Philippine general in the December army revolt.

FILIPINO COMMUNIST REBEL LEADER THREATENS AMERICANS AND JAPAN

MANILA, Philippines (APRIL 1) UPI -  A communist rebel leader said Sunday
guerrillas would step up attacks on Americans and warned Japan for the first
time against its alleged involvement in Manila's counter-insurgency drive.
   "We will certainly intensify attacks against US imperialism as long as it
increases intervention and control of our country," Romulo Kintanar, chief of
the 19,000-member communist New Peoples Army, said in a statement to news
agencies.
   "Our main targets are invasion troops and all US personnel involved in
counter-insurgency," he said, adding that other American civilians would not
be targeted.
   Guerrillas have been blamed in the past two years for the deaths of eight
Americans, including three active military personnel, one retiree, two
defense employees and two civilians.
   Kintanar also said he had information that Japanese Official Development
Assistance is being used for Manila's counter-insurgency campaign and for
projects that have deprived farmers of land and polluted the environment.
   "We warn the Japanese government to stop this and urge the Japanese people
to oppose this act of their government," Kintanar said.

US BANS MOST TRAVEL BY AMERICAN AIRMEN IN PHILIPPINES

MANILA, Philippines (MARCH 30) UPI - Officials at Clark Air Base banned
Friday most travel by American airmen to the Philippine capital, where a
policeman was killed in a communist-style ambush.
   An announcement over the US military television, Far East Network, said
travel to Manila by some 9,000 airmen at the headquarters of the 13th Air
Force is prohibited except for official missions.
   The announcement said exceptions could be granted on a "case-by-case
basis" by commanders at Clark, 50 miles north of Manila.
   Clark's travel ban followed a similar directive Tuesday from the commander
of US naval forces in the Philippines at Subic Bay Naval Station "due to
increased threats to US military members."
   Some 6,000 servicemen are stationed at Subic, the sprawling repair and
logistics center for the US Seventh Fleet, 60 miles northwest of the
Philippine capital.
   Eight Americans have been killed in the country in the past two years in
slayings the government blames on communist guerrillas.
   About a dozen Philippine lawmen have been killed in the past week in
metropolitan Manila in advance of the 21st anniversary of the founding of the
communist New People's Army.
