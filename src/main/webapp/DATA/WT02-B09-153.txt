<FONT SIZE=2><b>Retrieval</b><br>
The means by which the egg collection process (retrieval) takes place is by using the transvaginal ultrasound-guided method.  The female partner is positioned on a comfortable examination bed.  A small intravenous (IV) catheter is inserted into her arm. An IV of dextrose, lactose and salt solution is then slowly infused.  A speculum is placed in the vagina and both vagina and cervix are cleansed with sterile water.  A vaginal ultrasound is performed to visualize the abdominal area.  An injection site is made through the back of the vaginal wall to the ovary with a needle.  The follicles are penetrated by the ultrasound-guided needle and suction applied to drain the follicular fluid.  This fluid is examined via microscope by the embryologist who will inform the team members of the presence of an egg.  The length of time for the procedure is influenced by the total number of follicles.  Average time for the retrieval is one hour.  
<p>
Some discomfort may be experienced during the actual egg retrieval; however, most patients sleep through the procedure.  Currently, we administer medications derived from the Morphine and Valium family of drugs by IV to achieve a "twilight sleep."  We can arrange for a nurse anesthetist to administer anesthesia during the egg retrieval.
<p>
There is an additional charge of $250.00.  A check should be made payable to Cooper Anesthesia Associates.  Payment is due the day of the retrieval.  Patients with concerns or questions about using this service should discuss them with the IVF staff.
<p>
The retrieval is considered an invasive procedure.  There is a risk of infection, internal and/or vaginal bleeding, and possible damage to internal organs.  The patient is monitored throughout the retrieval and recovery process and will be discharged after satisfactory evaluation by ultrasound examination.  The duration of the recovery period is generally one to two hours.
<p>
Prior to discharge, an antibiotic will be given as a preventative measure to decrease risk of infection.  Instructions will also be given regarding progesterone supplementation.  Intramuscular injections or oral capsules of the hormone progesterone will be started after the retrieval to aid in the implantation process.

<b>Sperm Collection and Insemination<br></B>
During the retrieval, the male partner will be notified by the embryologist to produce a fresh sperm sample by masturbation.  The specimen will be processed in our laboratory and prepared for egg insemination.  Only the identified partner’s sperm and/or the designated donor’s sperm will be used to inseminate the eggs obtained from the female partner.  If you have a frozen semen specimen, (as previously recommended), then that sample will be utilized as a back up, in case of emergency.

<b>Incubation and Fertilization of Eggs<br></b> 
The eggs and sperm will be placed together in a special culture fluid and kept in incubators in our laboratory.  This process is called insemination.  The eggs will be examined 16-20 hours after insemination for signs of fertilization. If fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs are now described as zygotes.  When they divide to at least 2 cells they are called embryos.  The laboratory environment is conducive for fertilization to occur, however, it cannot be guaranteed that fertilization will occur.  Our average fertilization is 60% per cycle.  This percentage may be higher or lower.
<p>
You will be contacted by the embryology staff the morning after the retrieval.  Information will be given regarding the status of the eggs, fertilization, and possible cryopreservation (freezing of embryos) at that time.  The male partner may need to be available not only the day of the retrieval, but also the day following.  A second sperm sample may be needed to reinseminate those eggs which have not fertilized as yet.</FONT>
