<P>
The following information is from the 18 states that report to
the U.S. Department of Transportation the blood alcohol concentrations
(BACs) of at least<b> 80 percent of all fatally injured drivers</b>,
the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration. The research was conducted in 1994.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Alcohol involvement is <b>highest in nighttime </b>single-vehicle
crashes, in which 66 percent of fatally injured passenger vehicle
drivers in 1994 had BACs of 0.10 percent or more.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
<b>Crashes involving men</b> are much more likely to be alcohol-related
than those involving women. Among fatally injured male drivers
of passenger cars, 42 percent had BACs of 0.10 percent or more
in 1994. The percentage for women was 21.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
Traffic fatalities in <b>alcohol-related crashes dropped </b>by 2
percent from 1992 to 1993 and by 26 percent from 1983 to 1993.
In 1983, alcohol-related fatalities accounted for 56 percent of
all traffic deaths.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
More than<b> 1.6 million drivers </b>were arrested in 1992 for driving
under the influence of alcohol or narcotics.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
About<b> 2 in every 5</b> Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related
traffic accident at some time in their lives.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
In 1993,<b> 24.8 percent</b> of all drivers<b> killed</b> in traffic accidents
on <b>weekdays</b> were intoxicated, compared to 44.4 percent on weekends.

<P>
<A HREF="../pages/page3d.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/red.gif"border=0></A>
From 1983 to 1993, <b>intoxication rates decreased </b>for drivers
of all age groups. The greatest decrease was for 16-to-20-year-old
drivers. An estimated total of 13,968 lives have been saved by
21-year-old minimum drinking age laws since 1975.
