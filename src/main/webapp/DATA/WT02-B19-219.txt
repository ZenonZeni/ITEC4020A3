Enriching the Tapestry is one of the most informative and important programs on diversity
in the past 20 years!  Get practical solutions to everyday problems and learn to put the best
techniques and practices to use in your school!! <p>

The Symposium, co-sponsored by CEC, DDEL, and the Louisiana State Department of
Education, Office of Special Education, brings you more than 100 sessions and seven major
strands.  All were carefully chosen to give every participant the widest range of educational
