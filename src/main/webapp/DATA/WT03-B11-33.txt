GIANTS ENGAGE IN BATTLE FOR SUPREMACY

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

The Japanese telecommunications service market is set for change as
the country's two telecommunications giants, Kokusai Denshin Denwa
(KDD) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) battle for dominance
NTT announced at the end of August it would launch an international
multimedia service ahead of domestic international carriers, and a
possible tie-up with several major international carriers.

In a counter-offensive, KDD announced a plan to circle Japan with a
new submarine cable called J-I-H in collaboration with regional
carriers such as Tokyo Telecommunication Network(TT-Net). This
would expand the number of landing points it has from seven to 20
and challenge domestic long-distance carriers like NTT. KDD
estimates a 10 per cent share of the market with investments at 100
billion yen (US$93.4 billion). The J-I-H cable will not be in place
until 1999, but KDD does have another option for entering the
market-its microwave network which is already in place.

ONSE TELECOM-NEW POWER IN KOREA

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Newly-established Onse Telecommunications Corporation, is expected
to be awarded long-distance and local service telecommunication
licences by the end of this year. This is in addition to the
international service licence it was awarded in summer.

The licenses would enable Onse to become the third major
telecommunications power in the Korean wired communications market
after Korea Telecom and Dacom . The award to a relatively unknown
entity such as Onse has raised questions about the company's
ability to compete with telecommunication giants like Korea Telecom
and Dacom.

Onse has eight major shareholders and few have any experience in
the country's telecommunications business: These include Haitai,
Halla, Lotte, Korea Electric Power (KEPCO), Asea Cement, Daeryung,
and Ko Hai.

Already, Asea and Daeryung have announced a merger which would give
them a 30 per cent voting interest, but this grouping is unlikely
to wrestle controlling power from KEPCO.

JAPAN'S PHS GEARS UP FOR DATACOMS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Japan's PHS service is gearing up for a new phase with the
introduction of new high-speed data communications products from
Kyocera and DDI Pocket.

Kyocera announced that it will launch the country's first PHS
handset with an internal modem card. Its Datacope handset will be
capable of receiving, displaying and sending e-mail at up to 2,400
bps.

In a related development, DDI Pocket will offer PHS handset
adapters this December. The adapters will allow PHS handsets (eg.
the Datacope) 14.4 Kbps data transmission capability. The company
expects at least two other makers to have similar models out by
year's end.

PHS advocates believe the system is the ideal mobile handset
service for accessing the Internet and multimedia. The system was
designed to communicate at 32,000 bps, but users can only transmit
or receive data at up to 9,600 bps at present.

PHS handsets capable of transmitting at 32,000 bps are expected to
appear next spring after interface specifications for the system
are completed and announced by the PHS Internet Access Forum before
the end of the year.

KOREA TELECOM'S NEW VISION IN TROUBLE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY MIKE GALBRAITH

BARELY three months after it unveiled its long-term vision-called
"KT Vision 2005"-Korea Telecom (KT) is having severe short-term
problems regarding the implementation of old rudimentary
privatisation plans set in motion several years ago.

The vision paints a rosy picture of the company's future as a
successful private company, and outlines three main goals-30
trillion won (US$3.84 trillion) in revenues, a global management
system and lifelong benefits for employees by the year 2005.

Despite the desperate need of the Ministry of Finance and Economy
(MOFE) to tap the privatisation of KT as a key source of funds,
even the transfer of a significant share of the company's stock
into private hands is making little progress. In the last two
years, nothing has happened.

Union Challenge

More serious, though, has been the challenge to change mounted by
the labour union which has threatened to bring the country to a
halt. The union activists fear that privatisation will mean loss of
jobs, reduced benefits and job insecurity, and have found a number
of allies among extremist religious and student groups. The climax
of their activities was in June when they seized the office of the
Minister of Information and Communications.

KT Vision 2005

As a result, Korean president Kim Young-Sam sacked the president of
KT and installed Lee Joon, a former four-star general who was in
charge of the First Army. Lee Joon is taking the credit for "KT
Vision 2005".

Experts, however, believe that, so far, privatisation, and possibly
the new vision, are intended to be mainly cosmetic gestures to
distract attention from KT's troubles.

Others doubt that the company will be able to transform itself
successfully into the envisioned dynamic competitive carrier when
it really loses its monopolies. The big squeeze is already upon KT.

Competition started in the long distance business this year and the
government is even set to licence two carriers to enter the key
local call business by the end of this year.

It is believed that the strongly entrenched vested interests of
monopolies will not relinquish their benefits without a fight, and
Korean monopolies are showing themselves to be of an usually
resilient breed that are very hard to break up.

Therefore, the government is going to have great difficulty in
meeting its obligation to move KT into the private sector by 1998,
which it is committed to do under World Trade Organisation (WTO)
provisions.

OECD Membership

Failure to do so would also jeopardise Korea's claim to membership
of the OECD. With such powerful opposing forces in conflicting
motion, the near and medium-term weather in and around KT looks
distinctly cloudy.

BRIDGING YOUR BUSINESS WITH THE TELEPHONE SYSTEM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

A large transportation company provides improved customer service
utilising a simple screen pop based upon the calling line
identification (CLID) feature of ISDN.

As a customer calls in to request a pickup of a parcel, the account
representative automatically sees the customer's profile before the
call is answered.

This type of service can significantly reduce the call duration of
a standard parcel pickup request and removes the majority of the
repetitive components of the customer service representative's
daily routine.

Furthermore, this CTI customer has enhanced the database
application that the customer service representative uses so that
the database application automatically prompts the customer service
representative to discuss issues that the caller has inquired about
previously as well as additional information such as service
enhancements and parcel tracking.

Possible enhancements to this customer's configuration would be to
screen the incoming calls and review the customer numbers.

Premium customers (the 80/20 rule where 80 per cent of your
revenues are generated from 20 per cent of your customers) could be
queued with higher priority into the call center.

As well, an automated voice response system could be used to screen
callers looking for tracking information and parcel confirmation.

A credit card service bureau with local call centers in Japan, San
Francisco, New York, and Paris implemented a networked CTI solution
which provided a complete pay back in less than four months on long
distance toll charges alone.

This customer provides services for Japanese credit card holders.
As is typical in a service bureau, the agents are required to
provide a different level of service for different callers
depending on the services that the originating company contracted
with the service bureau.

In this particular case, the average call duration was eight
minutes as agents scrambled to determine the appropriate level of
service based on the callers profile.

The service bureau implemented a complete CTI solution in which a
SQL database was integrated with an voice response system and a
complete integrated network of call centers.

When an incoming call terminates on an agent, the SQL database will
be automatically triggered to enable the appropriate services for
the caller based upon the DNIS number and the callers
identification.

Depending on the callers' request, the caller inquiry could be
serviced locally or transferred (with the account data attached) to
a remote call center.

This configuration reduced the average call duration from eight
minutes down to three minutes per call and significantly enhanced
the professionalism of the call center.

Another CTI customer is a service center for a large multinational
semiconductor firm.

They have centrally located their Asian call centre and configured
a series of 1-800 telephone numbers from all Asia-Pacific countries
to centrally terminate upon the call center. The call center is
configured in teams which provide an account-focused service
center.

Each team handles calls from a particular country and/or account.
The customer uses a CTI technology to provide priority queuing for
the premiums customers, as well as basic ACD overflow capabilities
where, if all the team members are engaged, the calls will overflow
to another team/cell.

This CTI solution has provided a means for this customer to provide
a centralised call center which centralises the unique skills
required to support their customer, as well as enhancing the
services for previous customers.

Next Issue

Next month, we will take a look at the latest API-Javatel. This API
may turn out to be the best way  to ensure long term viability in
your CTI solution because Java will be supported on multiple
platforms. The Javatel API will support  multimedia transmission
over both the Internet and regular phone lines.

NORTEL CONTRACT

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Mandarin Communications, one of Hong Kong's six PCS licencees, has
awarded Nortel a contract worth HK$426 million (US$54.9 million)
for a DCS 1800 network. The DMS Supernode MSC network is expected
to be in place by mid 1997, when the operator is to roll out
services.

Concern

However, it is still unclear whether the Hong Kong market is
overcrowded; a concern to which Richard Siemens, Mandarin's deputy
chairman and managing director addressed: "A consolidation may be
noticeable in the near future with the weaker ones being swallowed
by the stronger PCS operators."

NOKIA TO SUPPLY TO HK PCS OPERATORS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Nokia is to supply the new digital cellular network equipment for P
Plus Communications, one of Hong Kong's new personal communications
services (PCS) license operators.

The initial value of Nokia's contract for phase one and two will
exceed US$30 million. Hong Kong's telecommunications regulator,
OFTA, officially handed over the PCS license to P Plus on Sep 30.

Nokia will supply P Plus with a complete personal Communication
Network (PCN) system which will be based on DCS 1800 technology.

The contract includes the switching platform, base station and
controllers, and the network management system. Nokia has already
started installing and testing the equipment.

hk to play vital role in china's telecommunication growth

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

HongKong Telecom's (HKT) biggest intangible asset is its
relationship with China, states a recent equity research report
published by an investment bank.

Salomon Brothers, recommending a 'buy' for the operator's shares to
stock players, predicts that HKT will play a major role in China's
cellular growth within the next 6-12 months, boosting its stocks,
which recently plummeted to an all-time low of HK$15 (US$1.9).

In the past, HKT has actively transferred equipment to the
mainland's various ministries of posts and telecommunications and
has also been instrumental in training the PTTs' engineering and
management staff.

The competitive pressure is rising in China, observes the report,
initiating potential new business ventures that will be thrown in
the direction of the Hong Kong operator.

At home, HKT's opportunities lie in its future businesses such as
interactive video-on-demand, home shopping and banking services, to
be introduced in mid-1997. These will raise network layout costs
tremendously, though it is believed that expected increase in
network traffic within Hong Kong will compensate for that cost. The
research also notes that the company is addressing issues such as
cost control to position itself strategically in the global telecom
market. According to Dan Sherman, regional telecommunications
analyst at Salomon Brothers, "HKT is lowering its cost structure
which alone should enable the company to exceed current
expectations. Growth earnings will be seen in the range of 13 to 15
per cent over the next three years".

Slashes in expenditure are coming through staff reduction by
retrenching 700 to 1100 heads per year until 1998; an upper target
of 13,500 job cuts is expected to be reached by end of 1998.

Other major cost cuts are being implemented by outsourcing its data
and technical services to IBM, allowing an estimated savings of
HK$50 million (US$6.45 million) per year, says the report.

ATM CHARGE BY GDC

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

US-based ATM switch specialist, General DataComm (GDC), is bringing
Apex-Strobos, its latest 25 Gbps ATM edge switch to the region. It
is currently vying for segments in vast ATM projects undertaken by
service providers like Hongkong Telecom.

In a recent agreement with Datacraft Asia, a regional systems
integrator, GDC will channelise its WAN and remote access products
into 10 countries within Asia Pacific.

In September this year, the two jointly lodged five separate
tenders for several major ATM backbone projects in a move to secure
major share in the rapidly deregulating Asian market.

GDC's chief operating officer, Ross Belson, intends to double his
company's 10 per cent revenue number from Asia Pacific within the
next year.

He said, "Our aim is to identify opportunities in huge potential
markets such as China, and at the same time provide constant
education to our customers who need to know about the constant
developments in areas such as telemedicine, remote site
videoconferencing and so on. We have bid for projects such as the
one with the ministry of health in China".

Experience

Belson believes Datacraft's experience and knowledge, especially in
the Chinese market will allow it to grab the market share it is
aiming for, even though the distributer has other ATM partners such
as Cisco, which recently acquired Stratacom, an ATM technology
specialist.

BIG ISLAND OFFER FREE YO-YO UPGRADE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Following HongKong Telecommunication's recent preview of its new
Caller ID for the territory, Big Island Communications has
announced a free text-to-speed upgrade to Yo Yo, the company's
Caller ID product.

With the upgrade, the product can use Caller ID, not only to put
the name of the caller on the screen, but hear the name spoken, all
before answering the phone.

Yo Yo includes a hardware attachment and software that allows a
user to screen calls, block calls, announce the caller, page the
caller information, and integrate those calls with several of the
leading contact management software programs.

Yo Yo, which was first released in June, and the new version Yo Yo
1.2.1, adds new features such as improved numeric paging, text-to-
speech caller announcement, and expanded call logging.

The new version's Yo Yo Logbook can now print, sort, and save the
duration, date and time for manually dialled calls.

For added ease of use, the Yo YoLand Yo Yo Phonebook now supports
printing and sorting. Yo Yo's Apple event support has been expanded

CORPORATE CHANGES FOR CHINA UNICOM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

China Unicom, the second mobile operator in China is undergoing
some major restructuring in its higher offices. The vice minister
of the Ministry of electronics industry (MEI), Liu Jianfeng, is
expected to take over as chairman replacing Yang Changji.

According to an Unicom spokesperson, the MEI is bound to have a
direct and more strong influence on the operator's activities in
future as opposed to the State Economic and Trade Commission, from
where the former chairman arrived.

One theory put forth by the spokesperson about the move was an
apparent reorganisation of MEI into a commercial corporation, which
is a fallout of the State's intended plans to turn the Ministry of
Electrical Power, Ministry of Metallurgical industry, and the MEI
into commercial entities. However, no confirmed steps have been
taken yet in this direction. The other theory put forth is
centralising Unicom's power in the regional branches.

The earlier interference of shareholders and state governments in
the regional operations will be ended by the headquarters taking
over control of these offices, especially in areas such as finance
and appointments of chiefs.

Currently, Unicom's shareholders comprise government and semi-
government bodies such as the MEI, the Ministry of Electric Power,
the Ministry of Railways, China International Trust and Investment
Corporation with various other companies and city governments. It
also receive international funding from foreign telecom groups.

STRANGE SHIFTS IN HK TELECOM MARKET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY MAHLON CAMPBELL

A recap on growth of wireless telecommunications in the last five
years in Hong Kong has shown many peculiar changes in the market.

Both the cellular and trunk radio market has seen increases of over
300 per cent, the pager market only increased by 1 per cent and CT2
came and went like the wind.

According to Smartone Mobile Communications there has been
extremely strong growth in cellular and this is expected to
continue for the next five years. Pager growth saturated and
declined, while trunk radio continues to be a "niche" and private
network application. And CT2 has been replaced by cellular
upgrades.

Most telecom analysts tend to agree with Smartone's view point of
the wireless telco market, but tread carefully when commenting
about the future. They say the wait-and-see approach has to be
taken.

Analysts say, "with the new PCS license been awarded, it is
interesting to see whether the six service providers can come out
with products and services on time as promised."

"Right now in Hong Kong the cellular penetration is 16 per cent out
of a population of 6 million," said Christopher Lau, controller
services of Smartone. He added this is one of the biggest
penetrations rates in the region.

According to Lau, Smartone forecasts the total mobile subscriber
rate to be 2.5 million by the year 2000.

"We see that 45  per cent of the working population will have a
mobile/wireless communication device," said Lau.

Smartone feels that Hong Kong people view wireless communication as
a important part of their daily life. And the market changes are
driven by competition, technology, regulations, the countries
economy and peoples life style.

Lau said, "to date Smartone has 100,000 subscribers under its belt,
but this figure will grow further as the market changes."

But Smartone's predictions for the next 18 months are optimistic.
They claim that there will be an emphasis on non-voice services and
providers will explore new market segments due to saturation of
usage, competition and user behaviour change.

There will be messaging service developments with extensive use of
IVR/voice messaging together with voice recognition enhancement.

RAD'S KVF.3 TO ENHANCE QUALITY OF KILOMUX 2000

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

RAD introduces a new low bit rate voice module for its Kilomux-2000
called the KVF.3, which claims to maximise bandwidth utilisation
while ensuring quality voice reproduction.

With the KVF.3, the Kilomux-2000 is able to deliver user benefits
like lower per port costs and better performance which is enhanced
by the use of the Multipulse Maximum Likelihood Quantisation
(MPMLQ) voice compression technology.The MPMLQ is claimed to
minimise distortion levels through two compression/decompression
cycles.

The KVF.3 converts the fax analogue signal of incoming fax
transmissions to a digital one. It also supports voice compression
rates of 4.8, 6.4, 7.2 or 9.6 Kbps and several voice/fax calls can
be carried simultaneously over a single 64 Kbps link.

Offering a choice of 2-wire or 4-wire E&M, 2-wire FXO or 2-wire FXS
analogue interfaces, KVF.3 supports connections to PABX trunk and
extension lines, or telephone sets.

GSM MOU PREDICTS HIGH GROWTH FOR ASIAN CELLULAR MARKETS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY JOYITA HALDAR

In its four years of existence, the GSM standard has experienced a
commendable growth with networks operating on the system in 86
countries across the globe.

Furthermore, a 50 per cent penetration is predicted by the year
2000, pointed Gretel Hoffman, chairperson of the GSM MoU
association at its 35th, and the region's first GSM MoU plenary
session, recently held in Hong Kong.

Supporting such indications, industry consultants observe that the
standard will be established in 100 countries by the end of the
decade with over 230 operators installing GSM networks.

Soaring Demand

The session revealed that an estimated four million subscribers
come from Asia, and the cellular market in the region is nowhere
near saturation point as demand for such services across Asia is
soaring, and so is investment in those systems.

Pyramid Research, for instance, estimates that regional spending on
mobile communications networks will almost triple by 2000 to US$10
billion from today's levels.

In many areas across the region, cellular networks are going up
faster than ordinary networks based on land lines, since cellular
networks are much easier to install.

One such example is China, where different cellular technologies
have been and are being trialled, including GSM and CDMA.

Even though capacity is higher than the number of people connected
to any mobile services within the country, John Gilbertson,
Ercisson's managing director for Asia Pacific, is of the opinion
that demand will overtake capacity, and a close to four million
subscribers will be connected by the end of next year.

Such optimism in the mainland's cellular marketplace is reflected
in activities such as the recent buy-out by the German operator,
Deutsche Telekom, taking a 25 per cent stake in a cellular phone
venture, with local partner China International Trust and
Investment Corp. (CITIC), Siemens, and American International
Group, Inc.

The partners are expecting around 600,000 subscribers to connect to
its network by the year 2010. Running on GSM, the network will
cover the cities of Tianjin, Wuhan and QingDao. China Unicom, the
only cellular competitor to the MPT, will operate the GSM networks
which is expected to boost the European technology further in the
country. Currently, China is also trialling the DCS 1800 systems,
as a compliment to its 900 MHz spectrum.

Biggest Market

Kurt Hellstrom, president of Ericsson Radio Systems and a
participant at the session, noted that Asia's growing demand for
cellular services is lucrative enough to make it the swedish
telecom giant's biggest market, quoting that Hong Kong and China
were already its second biggest trading place. Referring to Hong
Kong's new PCS licences, he pointed that networks for such services
would also be GSM-based, only operating at a higher frequency band
than current systems.

These new mobile services roll-out and associated value added
services will only increase penetration level of mobile
communications in the territory from 18 to 40 per cent by the next
millennium, and the role of equipment suppliers will be to keep the
prices low to stimulate demand in mass markets such as Hong Kong.
Five of Hong Kong's six PCS licencees have already opted for the
GSM standard.

However, some major concerns of operators still need attention-one
being billing and collection where their major concern is offering
services to anyone that comes into their markets and recovering the
revenues; the other major point of focus is the assurance of
roaming facilities to as many countries as possible to the
subscribers.

MKTL'S PAGER LICENCE IN JEOPARDY OVER DE-ACTIVATION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Ministry of Communications is planning to initiate actions
against Modi Korea Telecommunications Ltd (MKTL) for its failure to
maintain a database for its pagers, a pre-requisite for the
industry.

It may even withdraw MKTL's licence.

Family problems have led to dissent at the top level within the
Calcutta-based MKTL's holding company, Rossell Industries, whose
sales turnover has dropped steeply in 1995-96 to one-tenth its
level two years earlier [Rs56.7 million (US$1.64 million), against
Rs516.8 million (US$14.99 million) in 1993-94].

On Sep 10, 1996, the Alipore Court had issued an order of
injunction, restraining MKTL from de-activating the services of
nearly 1,000 subscribers.

In utter disregard of the Court's instructions, MKTL disconnected
the services of the subscribers on the night of Sep 11.

The court issued another order on Sep 17, directing the company to
restore all connections.

This has not yet been done. MKTL has admitted that it is not
maintaining a database of pager users, and that it "needed the
pagers physically to ascertain the codification".

However, Appocon Consultants, in a letter to the Ministry of
Communications, has strongly urged the cancellation of MKTL's
licence "in the larger interests of the general public, as they are
not competent enough to provide such services".

INDIAN MINISTER IN CORRUPTION CHARGE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Pandit Sukh Ram, minister for Communications in the ousted Congress
(I) cabinet of former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, is in the thick
of a massive corruption scandal that is threatening to turn the
entire telecoms world in India upside-down.

Sleuths of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raided his
houses in New Delhi and Mandi (Himachal Pradesh), and found Rs 36
million (over US$ 1 million) in loose cash and jewellery, lying
about the houses in suitcases and attache-cases.

While all this was happening, Sukh Ram himself happened to be
abroad, having ostensibly gone there for medical treatment.

The minister has since been trying every trick in the book to evade
the sleuths, and avoid coming back to India. The latest was that he
had produced medical certificates to show that, as a heart patient,
he had been advised by his doctors not to travel to India during
September.

Sukh Ram has been unable to account for the money found in his
houses, but Congress is worried that he may  pass them off as funds
collected for the party.

There were several telecom firms that were his favourites, notably
Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd. (HFCL) and Advanced Radio
Masts, whom he favoured with orders after overruling the
recommendations of the Telecom Commission.

Fiat Issued

The new Communications minister, Beni Prasad Verma, has since
issued a fiat to the Department of Telecommunications (DOT),
separating the process of placing purchase orders from the
decision-making on telecom equipment.

He has said that all future orders will be placed by the
appropriate DoT authorities, and not by the minister.

ISDN SERVICES TO COMMENCE SOON IN INDIA

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in India  has upgraded
its existing Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) to commercially
introduce Inte-grated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services.

Prospective users were provided with ISDN connectivity by end-
October 1996.

Worldwide, ISDN has emerged as a powerful tool for integrating
voice, data and image signals.

It may even be used for provisioning voice, data and image services
through an existing telephone network.

"The PSTN has been suitably upgraded through the installation of
ISDN switches to handle computer data transfers at 64 Kbps.

Digital Transmission

"Previously, this was impossible. In addition, the PSTN facilitates
digital fax and image transmission," said MP Modi, chairman,
Telecom Commission.

"The speed of data currently transmitted through the PSTN is
significantly restricted by the design of codes supplied by various
switching system manufacturers," he added.

To date, the PSTN has been solely optimised for human voice
transmission at much lower speeds-ideally at 4,800 bauds per second
(bps), going up to a maximum of 9,600 bps.

As a result, to transmit computer data at high speeds-for example,
at 64,000 bps (that is, at 64 kbps)-a user was compelled to obtain
a leased line from the DoT at a phenomenal cost. Thus, the
installation of a 64 Kbps line for a customer located 5 km away
entailed a minimum initial investment of Rs26,500 (US$750), coupled
with a bi-monthly charge of Rs5,000 (US$141).

Worse, leased lines are prone to frequent failure.

Further, since the line is exclusive, the user seldom has the
option to switch over to a new line.

Officials at the DoT believe that ISDN subscribers will not face
such problems, and that data transmission at 64 Kbps will be
possible at substantially reduced prices.

A prospective ISDN subscriber will only need to procure a special
ISDN handset for Rs300 (US$8.70), an ISDN PC card to obtain 64 Kbps
access, pay the DoT registration fee of Rs3,000 (US$87), and a
Rs1,000 (US$29) monthly rental as basic access rate (BAR).

Simulataneous Calls

Importantly, ISDN subscribers will be able to simultaneously handle
two independent calls on an existing telephone line.

The transmission mode could be speech, data, image or video. The
call set-up time between two ISDN subscribers is also very short,
compared to PSTN.

OPERATORS BANKING ON PHS AS ALTERNATIVE IN THAILAND

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SUTHISAK KRAISRI

THAILAND will finally became the second country in the world to use
the Personal Handyphone System (PHS), a cordless technology created
by Japan.

Two operators are expected to introduce the system, United
Communication Industry (Ucom) and the Shinawatra Group are making
the first move to compete with fixed-line operators who have been
stepping into their mobile market.

According to the Telephone Organisation of Thailand, there is still
room for at least two more private mobile phone operators to invest
in the handyphone service as well.

Shinawatra has been faced with fierce competition, especially from
the in-flux of Internet-related businesses. To stay ahead, the
decision was made to embrace the handy-phone business.

"As Shinawatra Datacom has expertise in networking, it has
capabilities in providing handyphone services as well," said a
Shinawatra executive.

The Ucom Group shares the same idea. But its proposal may be closer
to reality.

Ucom has been shouldering huge losses caused by the freezing of the
CT2 business since three years ago. The company wants to convert
the one-way communication service-called Fonepoint in Thailand-into
a two-way service.

Ucom plans to use Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunication
(DECT) technology to make the conversion.

Potential Doubt

Telecom analysts are doubtful of the potential of the PHS, and feel
that Thailand may not take to the technology as the Japanese have
done. Japan expects its number of registers to increase to three
million by year end. A TA senior executive said PHS would become
another choice for those who could not afford mobile phones.

The service is expected to gain wider acceptance in crowded
Bangkok-which offers a big market-but probably not in the
provincial regions.

Though the market potential is questionable, the Thai operators
have no qualms about the technology.

They believe that the investment in PHS is long-term and are hoping
that it will eventually develop into the same level as mobile
phones.

TA has promised to launch its personal handyphone by April next
year while TT&T also plans to introduce its products at about the
same time. The difference is that TT&T has already scaled down its
investment from investing in 20 provinces to around 8 provinces.

FOXCOM'S FIBREOPTIC TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

System 7000 is a low cost L-band (950 MHz-1750 MHz) distribution
system for satellite antenna remoting.

The system is suitable for situations where the highest possible
performance is not required and link distances do not exceed 10 km.
The system is designed to take its RF input from an LNB or
downconverter and directly convert this to 1310 nm light by means
of a Fabrey Perot laser. Transmission is via a 0.4 dB/km loss
single mode optical fibre.

System 7200 is the highend version and is intended for applications
such as Intelsat earth station antenna remoting, INMARSAT
transmit/receive, telecommunication interfacility links, and CATV
downlinks, where higher dynamic range is required.

The 7200 produces a better quality and higher power signal than the
7000 version by means of a DFB laser with low noise figure.
Effective transmission range is over 20 km.

The company's IF fibre optic transmission products include the 70
MHz or 140 MHz System 7070 (for links up to 5 km) and the higher
specification 7070D for links exceeding 20 km. The 7070D version
can operate in a multi-channel environment The 7070 series is
designed for broadcast up- and downlinks, teleports, and
interfacility communications for government and the military.

All of Foxcom's transmission products include an integrated
features set. Their plug-and-play capabilities incorporate
automatic gain control (AGC) that maintains optimum operation over
a wide range of signal levels and channel lineups and that enables
the end-user to set up the equipment easily.

All products also include (as an option) the 7050 bi-direction data
modem unit which provides an RS232 over single mode fibre link
between stations. The purpose of the 7050 is to monitor microcell
or antenna status and therefore can serve as part of a fibre break
diagnostic system.

OPERATORS RAISE FURORE OVER DOT'S DECISION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SHIRISH NADKARNI

INDIA's Department of Telecommunications (DoT) is facing tough
times.

This was made clear in mid-September when the DoT placed orders
with Hindustan Cables Ltd. (HCL) and Optel-two companies it had
earlier accused of being involved in a cartel.

In accusing the two companies, communications minister, Beni Prasad
Verma, had said: "We will take a serious  view of any cartelisation
that takes place. We will write strongly to the directors of these
companies against their involvement in the formation of cartels,
and ensure that we don't deal with these companies in future.

"In case companies get into a cartel again, we may be forced to
float a global tender."

But in mid-September, the DoT went ahead and placed orders with the
same companies-a proceeding that has caused waves of confusion to
wash through the industry.

"Since these two companies have been given the orders, it only
follows that they have gained from the cartelisation," said a
disgruntled competitor who had also hoped to get the order.

The tender had been floated on Mar 22 for the procurement of 21,000
km of fibre optic cable.

This included 9,000 km of six-fibre optical fibre cable, 10,500 km
of 12-fibre cable and 1,500 km of 24-fibre cable.

Sixteen bidders had taken part in the tender. They included
Sterlite Industries, Vikas Hybrid, Gujarat Optical, Birla Ericsson,
Aksh India, Optel, HCL, Plasmac and Bhilai Wires, Surana Telecom,
Sudarshan Telecom, Himachal Futuristic Communications Limited
(HFCL), Uniflex Cables, RPG Telecom and Plasman Telecom.

Cartel

When the bids were opened on May 21, it was found that all bidders,
barring Sudarshan Telecom, had engaged in the cartel.

They had quoted a price which was 16 per cent higher than the price
at which they had supplied orders the last time round.

All the prices were in a narrow range, which indicated that the
telecom companies had probably met and decided upon the quotations
they would make.

Sudarshan's quotations were substantially lower than that of the
other 15 bidders .

It had quoted Rs717.2 million for the supply of 9,000 km of the
six-fibre cable, while the other bidders' quotes ranged from
Rs961.9 million to Rs970.9 million.

Scandal

This is not the only scandal to rock India's telecommunications
industry.

In 1995, the former communications minister, Pandit Sukh Ram , had
scrapped the tender and placed orders with companies he favoured.

Sukh Ram is currently in Tihar Jail for having assets
disproportionate to his known sources of income.

Meanwhile, the DoT has been finding it difficult to get the holders
of the Letters of Intent (LoIs) issued by it for six basic telecom
circles, to sign the licence and interconnect agreements.

RPG Telecom, Tata Telecom, Hughes Ispat, Usha India, Essar Telecom
and Reliance-Nynex have all raised issues such as port charges,
billing disputes and arbitration, in separate letters to the DoT.

No Re-negotiation

"We are not re-negotiating the tender," explained a spokesperson of
Essar Telecom. "We want the scrapping of the clauses that were
added later to the tender, and which would make the projects
financially unviable.

"The inclusion of port charges, for example, is downright
unreasonable."

The LoI holders have also demanded that the roles of the DoT, the
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and the licensor be
clearly defined.

Said the Essar official: "All regulatory matters, such as the
review of the licensee's technology, quality of service standards,
and termination, revocation or suspension of licence, should be the
sole responsibility of the TRAI.

Arbitration

"Arbitration should be undertaken by an independent panel chosen by
an agreement between parties or undertaken by the TRAI when it is
established."

One of the major problems that the DoT is facing is that it is
sorely under-staffed.

Many managerial positions are vacant and there have been no
government sanctions to recruit new people.

The DoT is also plagued by the fact that all the telecom players
insist on having their say whenever any modification is made to any
agreement.

They are adamant that modifications should not be at the sole
discretion of the telecom authority, but by mutual agreement.

Clearly, considering the DoT's constant changes of stance in the
past, the operators are being extra cautious.

TWO-WAY PAGING SOLUTION FROM NEXUS FOR ASIA-PACIFIC

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY LAWRENCE NORMIE

Nexus Telecommunications Systems was founded in 1991 to develop and
manufacture portable wireless communication and location products
for two-way paging, automatic vehicle identification, and
industrial monitoring telemetry.

Nexus has developed a  wide area communication and location network
technology that combines the cost-efficiency of one-way paging
technology with the huge market potential of portable two-way
communication and location systems.

System Overlay

The Nexus approach is particularly attractive because its product
overlays existing paging system infrastructures, consequently
implementation and operation costs are significantly reduced.

The Nexus two-way communications and location system exploits a
one-way paging infrastructure for the out-bound communications link
(from the network to the subscriber devices) and proprietary
digital  spread spectrum technology for the in-bound communications
link (from the subscriber to the network).

The frequency hopping spread spectrum technique is effective in
combating interference due to spectral congestion, multipath
propagation and jamming as well as providing communications
security. The network complies with US FCC standard Part 15 and
operates in the band between 800 MHz and 1 GHz.

The network uses interferometric techniques to determine the
location of a unit in the field.

Transmissions from the unit are received by at least two base
stations, each equipped with an array antenna to determine the
direction of arrival from the point of transmission.

The arrival angle is calculated at each base station and the result
transmitted to the command and control center, where the location
of the transmission is calculated and displayed on an electronic
map together with identification information.

Nexus has been active in the Asia-Pacific market for two years. The
Nexus "NexNet" two-way paging  and location network became
operational in Sydney, Australia this September, following the Nov
1995 signing of an agreement with INC Communication, an Australian
company engaged in data communications, manufacturing, and
services.

Wide Growth

"The roll-out of the Nexus system and technology is the direct
result of the wide growth of the paging market in Asia Pacific and
the popular demand for value-added services" said marketing manager
Adi Pundak-Mintz.

Shlomi Tenenberg (VP Sales) said that the company's 1997 objectives
include expansion into paging markets other than Australia.

The company also is seeking additional partners for deploying its
systems in local markets in Asia-Pacific.

Nexus technology already is being used under license in India and
two-way paging and end-units are manufactured for Nexus by Samsung
Electronics Corporation  (Korea) under a nonexclusive licensing
agreement.

According to Pundak-Mintz, specific product definition and
marketing  issues that relate specifically to Asia-Pacific include
high volume usage, the requirement for special character sets in
end-devices, and the high sophistication of technologically-
adaptive customers.

ISRAEL-THE LAND OF HIGH TECH OPPORTUNITIES

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY PETER TSUKAHIRA

High-tech business culture is being transformed as the rate of
worldwide technological change steadily increases.

This is evident in fields none other than high-speed, local area
and wide area telecommunications.

The personal computer revolution has placed even greater computing
power on the desktop in offices and homes around the world.

With the explosive growth of electronic mail services and the
Internet's World Wide Web, more and more people are using their
personal computers as networking end-stations than ever before.
This surge of technological change, coupled with greater freedom of
access to networked information, is forcing the creation of new
types of corporate structures.

Older, hierarchical corporate structures with fixed chain-of-
command reporting and clearly defined functional "borders" are
unable to respond quickly enough to exploit developing market
opportunities.

Today's high-tech markets consist of multi-national, multi-cultural
organisations where even small and medium-sized manufacturers are
players in the global environment.

De-centralised corporate structures, based on personal
relationships and shared goals rather than rigid organisational
lines, are required to survive and thrive in this internationally
competitive environment.

Cultural Mosaic

Israel's society is young in the sense that the modern nation is
not yet even 50 years old. Israel is a cultural mosaic of
immigrants from literally every corner of the globe. Everyone, it
seems, has a different cultural background and this has resulted in
a society where boundaries tend to be relatively undefined and
where extreme informality is considered normal.

Israel is a small and militarily vulnerable country. Israeli army
officers are taught to view advance planning as necessary, but only
as a basis for making required changes. That is to say, they are
taught to quickly adapt to changing conditions, to improvise and to
have a positive attitude towards taking calculated risks.

Despite having invented one of the world's first minicomputers in
the early 1970's, the Israeli computer industry has not been a
force to be reckoned with until quite recently.

Israel's high-tech industry has grown rapidly and in the present
era of networked computing, this small nation fields a number of
high-tech developers and network device manufacturers
disproportionate to its size.

Representatives from key industry publications confide that Israel
has joined the greater Boston area and Silicon Valley as a major
geographical source of advertising dollars.

The reasons for Israel's new-found prominence in this field is
multifarious. It has to do with the youth and vitality of modern
Israel, a highly educated workforce and the motivation of the
talent available.

The Israeli high-tech industry excels at producing practical,
robust and relatively simple solutions for complex problems.
Perhaps this is the result of the kind of military training that
every young man experiences as part of his upbringing.

Quality performance in small groups and quick decision-making by
junior officers are Israeli traits developed in the army. These
abilities will serve Israel well in the fiercely competitive
international high-tech marketplace.

The computer networking world is still relatively new and growing
rapidly. Small groups of highly motivated engineers working in non-
structured environments can still create the next industry's "hot
box" or best seller product. Because time-to-market is crucial to
the success of a new product, quick decision making and on-the-fly
implementation are highly valued.

These Israeli capabilities have not gone unnoticed in the global
search for high-technology talent. Huge multi-national companies
have begun acquiring  smaller Israeli high-tech communications
companies.

In recent years, NiceCom, a Tel Aviv-based ATM developer was
acquired by 3Com; Scorpio Communications by US Robotics;
intelligent hub maker, LanNet was acquired by Madge of the UK and
LAN switch start-up, Ornet was bought by Siemens.

I believe the Asia Pacific societies place a high value on virtues
like patience, self-discipline and social cohesion. This is
reflected in the attitudes and behaviour of the workforce and Asian
"corporate culture."

These strengths lend themselves to precision manufacturing and high
quality, low cost mass production. It seems that as soon as a given
technology stabilises, companies in Asia Pacific add refinements
and then seize market leadership.

This is apparent in the worldwide market for computer memory chips.
This technology was pioneered in the US and Europe but now is
dominated almost entirely by Asian companies.

In spite of Asia Pacific dominance in a wide range of industries
from musical instruments and automobiles to optics and electronic
equipment of all kinds, one vital technology has proven most
difficult to master. This is the area of microprocessor design.
While Asia is the champion of computer memories, the US has
maintained a commanding lead in microprocessors.

The major US chip manufacturers (Intel, Motorola, National
Semiconductor) each have large facilities in Israel where
microprocessors and other devices like digital signal processors
are designed and built.

The Intel Corporation recently completed planning for the next
generation Pentium processor, the first to be developed entirely in
Israel. Intel also announced plans for an additional US$1.6 billion
dollar facility in Israel for flash memory fabrication.

An interesting but little known fact is that Silicon Valley in
California, a place where new technologies abound, is home to many
expatriate Israelis. When some high-tech companies in Israel
recruit, they will often place ads in local San Jose newspapers
hoping to catch experienced returnees.

As more Asian companies enter the global high-tech marketplace,
contact with Israeli technology developers will grow.

Partnerships

Collaboration between Israeli and Asian communications companies
have the potential to be extremely innovative and fruitful.

There are already some notable partnerships existing today
producing very positive results. Asian companies doing business
with Israel stand to gain not only technology but ideas. Israel's
close geographic and cultural proximity to Europe means access to
European market channels for Asian-Israeli business tie-ups.

Israeli high-tech products are to be found in operation on
customers' premises throughout Asia-Pacific. Direct investment in
Israel by South-east Asian multi-national companies is growing.
Increasingly, in today's global marketplace, the Far East will be
meeting the Middle East in high technology.

ADVANCING THE STATE OF THE SUBSCRIBER LOOP

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

FOR many new telephone users in fast-growth telecom regions such as
China, Korea and India, their initial experiences have been with
traditional phone services over ordinary twisted-pair copper
wiring.

However, major telecom providers in China and other countries are
now installing sophisticated high-speed, high-bandwidth, all-
digital backbone infrastructures.

But for most users, primary telephone services will, for now, be
based on this traditional, POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service)
model.

In POTS, the speaker's voice is carried over analogue circuits
which originate at the telephone's microphone. The signal is
delivered to a subscriber-loop switch. There, the voice waves are
converted into digital information then sent via high-speed lines
to the subscriber-loop switch of the receiving party.

But even within POTS, significant advancements are underway,
particularly in the key analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
conversion components, ie. the codecs.

For instance, thanks to semiconductor integration, codecs and their
related filtering functions-which used to require multiple chips-
were combined into single, integrated chips in the early 1980s.

The resulting devices contributed substantially to the worldwide
proliferation of digital telephone switches.

Now and in the future, newer DSP (digital signal processing)
technologies and smaller semiconductor process technologies are
enabling designers to build codecs with multi-channel
architectures.

Today, each telephone number requires a unique codec in the
subscriber loop switch. Multi-channel codecs will be able to handle
several independent subscriber telephone conversations
simultaneously.

Eventually, as many as 32 channels may be integrated in a single
piece of silicon.

The savings in space and cost will be significant.

And those savings will help further boost residential and business
telephone installations in countries such as China, where
expectations currently run as high as 20 million new line
installations per year.

Fibre to the Curb

Another advance involves the continual distribution of telecom
functions-and of "fat-pipe" digital bandwidth-closer to homes.

To do that, telecom providers are now able to place a multiplexer,
called a digital loop carrier (DLC-also known as a remote access
unit), between the subscriber-loop switch and the home.

The DLC helps to extend the geographical area served, and it
extends high-speed digital bandwidth for video and similar
applications closer to the user.

This type of distribution permits bringing "fibre to the curb," or
at least to the DLC.

Although copper twisted pair and coaxial cable are digital-capable,
fibre is preferred both for reasons of economy and because it
permits greatly extended service provisioning.

Another critical subscriber loop function is the subscriber line
card, or SLIC.

The SLIC co-exists with the codec at the subscriber loop switch or
the DLC. Its role is to perform certain supervisory functions, and
to balance the subscriber loop in order to produce an optimal
signal.

Subscriber loops vary in length and signal characteristics from
country to country and even among local services.

In response, the newest trend in SLIC technology involves software-
programmable balance features.

These permit providers to make on-site adjustments to meet various
specifications without requiring circuitry modifications. The
result: remotely-controlled automation, and more easily distributed
functionality.

Digital to the Door

In addition to "fibre to the curb", ISDN (Integrated Services
Digital Network) is fast gaining notoriety as a major performance
enhancer for Internet communications.

At up to 160 Kbps bandwidth, it can make Internet graphics seem to
jump onto the screen-a vivid contrast to the less nimble
performance of today's typical 14.4 and 28.8 Kbps modems.

Beyond its Internet performance, the advent of residential ISDN
represents a milestone in the evolution of the subscriber loop.

By simply adding ISDN transceivers at each end of the subscriber
loop, operators can make use of the same copper twisted pair wiring
now employed for low-speed analog services to deliver high-speed,
all-digital information right to the user's own computer.

All that is needed today, for people in many parts of the world, is
an ISDN adapter card or external modem, and an added service from
the telecom provider.

And for users in countries with newly-developing telecom
infrastructures, ISDN may be closer than it seems.

Today, the services may be analog POTS, but the backbone and
subscriber loop switches in developing countries such as China,
Korea, India, and Taiwan are ISDN-capable-good news for future ISDN
users in those regions.

Also good news is the fact that, as with other technologies, future
generations of ISDN transceivers are destined to become
increasingly smaller and more economical.

As with the codec, newer ISDN implementations will make use of
multichannel architectures. As many as eight individual
transceivers may be integrated into a single silicon chip at the
telecom provider's subscriber loop switch, and this will help to
drive down costs, and drive up availability.

Semiconductor integration will benefit users in other ways.

Future ISDN internal adapter cards (or external modems) will
feature increasing levels of integration.

Today, those units contain numerous discrete support devices-for
translating data formats between the internal PC bus and the ISDN
transceiver, for instance, or for the codec functions still
necessary to support a second, standard telephone or fax service as
a peripheral to the PC.

In the future, they will be integrated with the microcontrollers,
memory and other components that populate adapter cards into a
true, single-chip adapter card system.

Video in the Loop

What's next? Full motion video, for one thing, over standard
twisted-pair copper wiring, thanks to the "XDSL" (or X Digital
Subscriber Line) technologies: Asymmetric (ADSL), Hybrid (HDSL),
and Very-high-speed (VDSL).

In reality, a second pair of copper wires will have to be added to
the subscriber loop in order to do the job. But the result will be
well    worth the small additional infrastructure expense.

For instance, ADSL has been tested at a download rate of more than
6 Mbps, and an upload rate of 640 Kbps-faster than ISDN, and far
beyond today's common modem speeds.

Moreover, ADSL is closer than many realise, as well.

Numerous lower-speed ADSL products are already on the market.

With ADSL-and with the advances in compression made possible by
sophisticated DSP semiconductor technologies-telecom providers will
finally be able to offer high-quality movie transmissions to
residential users.

Subsequently, the subscriber loop will be enhanced again by the
addition of HDSL as a user choice.

HDSL may not offer as high a download bandwidth as ADSL, which
continues to improve as development progresses, but it will bring
symmetrical capabilities to twisted pair transmissions. This will
open the door to the possibilities of interactive movies and games,
potentially a vast market.

Along with ADSL and HDSL, will come VDSL. It may require adding a
second twisted pair to the telephone line.

Most homes already have "twisted quad" or better wiring in place,
even though they do not use it.

In new installations, savvy telecom providers are likely to use
multiple pairs in order to be prepared for the future. VDSL will
reward its implementers with a download bandwidth that could reach
52 Mbps, and upload bandwidth as high as 6 Mbps.

Bandwidth Knocking

Importantly, these and other advances in subscriber-loop
capabilities will make possible exponential increases in home-
delivered bandwidth-all over traditional twisted-pair copper
wiring.

By putting in place the infrastructure basics today-the high-speed
wide-area digital backbones, and the digital-ready subscriber-loop
switches-the world's telecom providers are preparing the way for
relatively easy upgrades to higher-bandwidth technologies, and to
added user services.

At the same time, these advances will not necessarily limit users
to a single, copper-wire transmission medium. Various cable-
oriented providers are pushing hard to gain a share of the high-
bandwidth residential/small office market via fibre-optic or hybrid
fibre/coaxial technologies.

Advances in twisted-pair technologies will prove beneficial to the
traditional telecom providers, as will their experience with
communications interactivity.

As for the cable companies, they already have the high bandwidth;
what they need is an interactive, economical "subscriber-loop"
infrastructure-just like the telecom providers.

In all probability, the users will benefit from having choices in
both technologies.

Today's analogue POTS user can migrate forward as twisted pair
bandwidth grows, and can elect to grow with POTS-or move to cable-
at points along the way that are convenient for the user, and not
dictated by industry vendors.

TELECOMMUNICATION SWITCH MANUFACTURERS STILL RULES

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

While the computer manufacturers are gaining ground in
telecommunications networks under IN's advances, there should be no
mistake: the telecommunications switch manufacturer is still king.
This is because the manufacturers can use IN functions as a lever
in the sale of central office switches, and offer an entire package
that is guaranteed to work flawlessly.

Perwira Ericsson's AXE switches, currently delivered to Telekom
Malaysia, include IN functions, as did Lucent's  shipments of 5ESS
switches to Philippines' Globe Telecom. Ericsson will add AXE
switches/SDH transmission equipment to those shipped to the
Guangdong PTA by Lucent.

Telecom equipment manufacturers also win IN contracts outside of
direct switch sales. Ericsson has implemented a universal personal
telecommunications platform in Australia; and Guangdong-Nortel will
supply the Beijing Telecommunications Administration (BTA) with IN
features that build on the CCS7 network supplied previously to the
BTA.

Switch manufacturers are collaborating with computing manufacturers
too. Parts of Hewlett-Packard's (HP) OpenCall platform were used in
Nortel's ServiceBuilder architecture, and Lucent is working with HP
to jointly develop IN functions.

Switch manufacturers are also continuing to develop IN on their
own. This year, Lucent showed Advantage, an IN platform for
creation, customisation, and delivery environment of IN services
such as voice/fax mailboxes, voice activated dialling and one
number services for mixed media. Advantage serves as both SCP and
IP (see main story on page 10 for definitins) for wire line and
wireless networks; its capabilities extend from the PSTN to data
and multimedia networks.

Intelligent Gain

Siemens introduced the concept of using intelligent agents with IN
through its global advanced intelligent network (GAIN) platform.
The idea was demonstrated with a calendar manager application that
automatically arranged appointments in an electronic diary. Those
messages could also be read over the telephone.

Tandem Computers' NonStop operating kernel, and Himalaya and
Integrity IN middleware are joined by the S4000 Unix standard
servers. The company's platforms have been installed for call
processing, operations support systems and decision support.

Vying to increase its role in telecommunications, HP's  strategy
plans to serve as the hardware, operating platform and applications
middleware.

HP's OpenCall platform, released in September last year, is a bid
to do much of the same for IN. In addition to its relationships
with Nortel and Lucent, Fujitsu, Ericsson, and Nokia are some
companies offering OpenCall support.

IBM's Multiple Services Platform/6000 (MSP/6000) for business and
residential IN applications, uses the company's RISC System /6000
operating under AIX. MSP/6000 can operate as both SCP and/or IP in
the network, and is bundled with software handling voice, fax, and
data IN. MSP/6000 uses CallPath DirectTalk/6000 as a voice
peripheral for voice messages, interactive voice response, and
audiotex. Data processing adds functions such as messaging and
gateways for e-mail, and access to on-line services.

Call management provides the SSP function and manages user and
service access to the MSP/6000 node. Messaging support adds line-
based paging notification and applications interfaces to other
messaging systems.

System Integrators

Bellcore, formerly the communications research facility of the US
telcos, is one of the world's most influential AIN consulting and
engineering service companies. While Bellcore will work within the
operator's requirements, it also has its own IN/AIN service control
point system (ISCP) software. ISCP consists of SPACE (service
creation and positioning software), DRS (data and reports system,
for custom data collection and reporting), and a data distributor.

For the IP component, Bellcore has its intelligent services
peripheral, which allows voice or keyboard directions to access
complex IN functions.

The Sema Group is a major systems integrator with a global reach as
well. A large part of the company's focus is in wireless systems,
though its value added services manager (VAS Manager) provides an
IN core around which wireless and wire line services can be built.
The VAS Manager uses interactive voice response, and integrates
voice and text messaging, as well as supports wire line call
routing and wireless roaming.

The integrator has worked together with Alcatel to supply wireless
components to Indonesia's Satelindo as well.

Unisys, a hardware supplier and systems integrator, offers its A-
Series OpenFrame computers with its Network Applications Platform
(NAP) software.

For IN, NAP's VoiceSource application provides interactive voice
response. VoiceSource has been used for automated attendant,
automatic collect calling, enhanced emergency services and audio
calling directories. It has also been used for networking (such as
X.400), fax response, paging, and voice messaging services.

TINA-THE NEXT MILLENNIUM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Telecommunications Information Networking Architecture (TINA)
standard proposes two actions: to merge AIN (Advance Intelligent
Networks) and telecommunications network management with the
computer industry's object-oriented software and client-server
distributed computing concepts; while removing these functions from
their link to the underlying transport network.

The management aspect of TINA is handled according to the
Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) specifications.

TINA is based on an "open" computing architecture, incorporating
the Object Management Group's (OMG) common object request broker
architecture (CORBA).

CORBA is used to allow software "objects" and applications to work
together, independent of the underlying hardware and programming
language used. TINA's object definition language, for example, is a
superset of OMG's CORBA interface design language, using additional
concepts for grouping, stream interfaces and service attributes to
support real-time traffic in large networks.

Part of TINA's charter is to fill the role as the service and
management platform for ATM and multimedia broadband services. This
means managing and providing Internet services and telecom
infrastructure. TINA is meant to integrate completely into existing
wire line and wireless IN infrastructures, and is being designed to
co-exist and cooperate with all existing IN services.

Service creation in TINA will be a matter of picking and choosing
from a software object library of re-useable service components, to
which new components can be defined and added continuously.

TINA Consortium

The TINA Consortium (TINA-C) was founded in 1993 and consists of
engineers from 40 telecoms and IT companies around the world (see
Table 1). With its HQ at Bellcore's facilities in the US, TINA-C
has a five-year charter to define and validate a software
architecture that will allow communications services to be
introduced efficiently where computing, entertainment and
telecommunication industries are merging.

This year, TINA-C will evaluate, validate, and refine
specifications whose completed architecture is expected to be
presented by the end of 1997.

The TINA concept consists of several architectures; distributed
computing, service, network and management.

The computing architecture describes how software objects should be
'plugged' into the distributed processing environment. The service
architecture defines how services are provisioned, accessed, and
used. The network defines how the network resources are ordered and
used to establish end to end connections. The management
architecture gives specifications for configuring, accounting,
performance, and security.

Unlike IN, which is applied separately to each call, TINA defines
sessions which can be any number of activities to achieve a
purpose. There are several types of sessions under the service
architecture, eg. an Access Session defines the entrance into TINA
services, allowing the user to access, make requests, and retrieve
information.

Where UPT (universal personal telecommunication) exists today as a
basic form of mobility, TINA defines three different types of
mobility for future universal mobile telecommunications systems
(UMTS): Personal mobility allows a subscriber to use services
independent of their network point of attachment and specific
equipment. This feature is offered by some PABXs, which allow an
employee to sit down at any handset, punch an identifying code, and
have access to all their personal, customised features.

Terminal mobility makes use of terminals independent of the point
of attachment to the network, and exists today in the form of UPT.

Session mobility, which allows service sessions to 'follow' the
participant. This means that a subscriber could suspend a session
and resume it from a different terminal at a later time. This
allows the subscriber to request information and have it ready the
next time the service is accessed.

Figure 2 gives an example of TINA-C operating for service delivery
to users through a telecoms network. The user domain represents the
user and their terminal equipment The content domain represents
those that produce or licence content for wholesale use, such as
the film industry or multimedia information providers.

The network domain is the network operator, eg. PTT, which provides
the underlying connections to deliver the content. The retailer
domain is the brokers of information services who present and
'sell' the available information services to the consumer.

SWITCHING AWAY TO CLIENT-SERVER NETWORKS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BRIAN WASHBURN

THE Intelligent Network (IN), first thought up in the 1960s, has
gradually migrated from the telecommunications equipment
manufacturers field into the realm of computing.

In the early years, the intelligence resided in the switch. Each
switch needed a "service logic", instructing it how to process and
direct calls. This meant that with any new service introduced, the
software in each switch had to be upgraded.

As switch software became more complex, new IN features also became
riskier. In telecommunications where there was little room for
software bugs, IN services developed by telecoms switch
manufacturers often were not compatible.

A simple solution was to take the service logic away from the
switch, and place it in a central computer, which would serve the
network. The switches would thus only hold the interfaces that send
and receive information with this central computer. This developed
into the modern concept of IN.

Today, the IN market is inhabited by a mix of computing, software
and telcos. Together with telecommunications network management, it
appears that the computer manufacturers are gradually making in-
roads on a hardware basis and looking towards inheriting the rest
of the field as well.

Freephone (toll free) and premium rate services were some of the
first IN features developed using off-switch computing.

More advanced IN features  today include universal personal
telecommunications (UPT), or one number services, and virtual
private networks (VPNs). UPT introduces the concept of the mobile
terminal, routing calls by various schemes to the subscribers,
regardless of whether they are at home, at work, or travelling with
a mobile handset.

VPNs allow Centrex services to be available over the wide area
instead of on a switch by switch basis, allowing four digit
internal dialling and other features such as call hold, call
forward, and three way conferencing through the public network.

To denote the difference between the simpler IN services
(freephone) and those advanced services, the term Advanced
Intelligent Network (AIN) came into use.

AIN describes IN that gives greater control to the computer, and is
less reliant on the central office switches.

In March 1992, the ITU defined Intelligent Network Capability Set 1
(IN CS-1), which set a global standard frame work for constructing
advanced IN services and interfaces. Last year, the ITU-T completed
enhancements to CS-1. Defining additional IN capability sets (CS-2,
CS-3) under Study Group 11/Working Party 4 of the ITU-T is
progressing well, and the work is published under the Q.12XX series
of recommendations.

Components in today's IN architecture are: the service switching
point (SSP), service control point (SCP), service creation
environment (SCE), service data point (SDP), service management
system (SMS), and intelligent peripheral (IP) (see Figure 1).

The SSP is an element installed at the local exchange. When a call
requests an IN service, eg. by dialling a calling code that
accesses a freephone service, the SSP sends the request over the
signalling network to the service control point, which uses the
common channel signalling system 7 (CCS7) or other signalling
protocol. It then awaits instructions on how to handle the call.

The SCP is the "intelligence" behind the IN. It receives requests
sent by the SSPs, processes and sends a reply such as call routing
instructions back to the SSP. It does not matter how many SCPs are
in the network, or where each is located, as long as each switch
has an SCP it can access.

The SDP is another name for a database which connects and supplies
the SCP with data. Some IN services need to store a great deal of
data, eg. UPT system contains several cross-referenced phone
numbers for hundreds of thousands of customers.

The IP provides custom resources for interaction between a user and
the IN. Presently, this is voice processing coupled with services
such as speech and number recognition for wire line or wireless
networks.

The SCE and SMS are not part of the actual active services under
the IN make-up. Rather, the SCE is a design and modelling
environment to develop and test new services before loading them
onto the SCPs. The SMS handles central network management for the
SCPs, and is used to introduce and distribute new software
throughout the network.

IN, however, is not only a matter of adding intelligence to the
public network, its challenges reach far beyond the IN components
themselves.

Billing is one issue that needs to be resolved. Fortunately, IN
billing is somewhat similar to toll-operator billing. In networks
where operator assistance, call collect, and third party billing
are incorporated into the billing infrastructure and eventually
find their way onto the subscriber's invoice, adding IN support is
another step in the same direction.

IN requires capturing information and adding the charges to
subscriber invoices. Many current billing systems are inflexible
and must be modified to accommodate the more complex IN, especially
when services like usage-based IN service metering are introduced.
Additionally, the IN equipment needs some sort of accountability to
generate reports.

Things become even more complex when multiple network services are
involved. UPT that incorporates cellular, wire line, paging, and
other types of terminal devices operated by different PTT branches
or operators can create a billing nightmare.

The technical counterpart to the headache is in tying existing
voice and fax messaging, interactive voice response, and other
network elements into the IN.

But perhaps the most difficult issue is that IN obstacles do not
end on technical matters: Which branch is responsible for the IN
functions and the customer? How does the PTT determine the revenue
split from services that span across another operating unit's
resources, and across different networks? These concerns are joined
by regulatory issues-where a PTT's operations may not be authorised
to operate "bundled" wire line, cellular, and paging services.

Another area of potential trouble, but one of great potential
benefit as well, is in testing how new IN features may interact
with existing IN.

For example, combining UPT with VPN service to allow business
professionals to dial in to a home office from anywhere may be a
very valuable feature for some businesses. This sort of service
would allow an employee to call the company's freephone number,
give a security identification, enter their present telephone
number and forward all business calls to their location.

NEW GIGASWITCH/IP: SIMPLE, COST EFFECTIVE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY GRAEME K. LE ROUX

EARLIER this year we looked at the state of play with ATM.

We suggested that, while the ATM standards set was coming along
nicely, deploying a real ATM network was still fraught with more
than a few problems.

While much work has been done since then, ATM is still something
the average network manager is best advised to treat as a spectator
sport if at all possible; but the game is getting more interesting.

Practical Advance

Perhaps the most practical advance in ATM has been recently
introduced by US-based Ipsilon in partnership with Digital in the
form of ATM-based IP Switching technology.

This is probably the first generally useful application of ATM.

It is, perhaps, more than a little ironic that IP Switching as
exhibited by the Digital GigaSwitch/IP is in effect, a method of
turning an ATM network into a single logical IP router.

Remember the hype about ATM marking the beginning of the end of the
router?

Ipsilon's technology differs significantly from other ATM-based
routing solutions which have been less than impressive.

The ATM-based router "solutions" which have been released by
several vendors, have simply been various methods of connecting one
or more "fat pipes" to a traditional router.

Ordinary IP traffic is broken into cells, transmitted with varying
degrees of reliability across an ATM network, and  reassembled into
the original IP packets.

This should not be confused with the process of de-fragmentation
which IP routers do not perform.

The reassembled cells are then routed in the traditional manner
using information propagated with ordinary routing protocols such
as RIP or OSPF.

Build a network of, say, five routers using this type of technology
and all you are doing is substituting ATM interfaces-one per
router-and an ATM switch for ordinary high speed serial interfaces-
four per router.

Such a network behaves in exactly the same way whether you use
serial interfaces or ATM, provided you do not flood the ATM switch
in which case cells are dropped.

There is no solid data on what happens if you do flood the ATM
switch in a situation like this because nobody has tried it yet in
the real world.

It is possible that your expensive ATM switch might turn into a
random fault generator and the five routers (or the end stations
connected to them), would then spend a lot of time reconfiguring
themselves around the "faulty" links through the ATM network and
trying to retransmit data.

On the other hand, the routers might throttle back transmitting
stations via normal IP mechanisms.

This would leave the ATM switch with the inter-router traffic
generated by the routing protocol in use-that is a much smaller
load.

In this case, it would recover, enabling it to provide reliable
links once more and, in turn, permitting the routing algorithms to
converge.

Which of these scenarios actually occurs would depend upon the
equipment in use, the nature of the IP traffic between the routers,
the performance of the IP's flow control mechanisms, the
intelligence of the router's ATM interfaces, and so forth.

Would the network recover or not?

Flip a coin or better yet buy the network described above, try it
and send us an e-mail; we'd love to know.

Avoids Problems

Ipsilon and Digital's approach avoids the potential problems in the
scenario described above in two ways.

First, Digital's Gigaswitches are designed such that no possible
combination of ports can exceed the back plane bandwidth of the
switch which, when combined with their non-blocking ATM flow
control algorithms, all but eliminates dropped cells.

Second, Ipsilon treats the whole ATM network as a single router
which extends, in the example outlined above, to five separate
locations and not a network of discrete routers.

As a result there are no convergence issues-OSPF, RIP, and so forth
are intended to work between routers, not within them.

If you were to interconnect five GigaSwitch/IP-based networks
(let's say, five large university campuses) via 10 links (standard
DDN links, for example), you would have precisely the same
convergence issues which you have right now -ATM would not come
into it.

Target Market

The GigaSwitch/IP is aimed at Internet Service Providers or large
campus sites.

It is significantly cheaper than any comparable solution based on
standard routers.

All this is made possible by the remarkably simple-at least in
concept-idea of looking at the nature of an incoming IP packet.

If an incoming IP packet is something short,  let's say a DNS look
up, then a routing decision is made and an SVC is set up within the
ATM network by the Ipsilon software.

The packet is broken up into ATM cells, transmitted via the SVC,
the SVC is torn down, the packet reassembled and transmitted out of
the destination port of the "router". This is a slow process. The
SVC set up and tear down is, however, not significant and neither
is the process of packet disassembly and re-assembly.

It is the routing decision which takes the time-this is what
prohibits the average "ATM-capable" router from working much faster
than the same device connected to a serial interface.

The interesting part is that only about 10 per cent of IP packets
fit this category of a "short" transmission.

Ninety per cent of IP traffic is a stream of several packets such
as a file transfer, Web page hit, and so forth. For this sort of
traffic, there is no point in setting up and then tearing down
SVCs.

This means that after the first packet is processed, you have a
virtual point-to-point link within the ATM network which is, in
this case, the router.

If you have a point-to-point link between the source and
destination ports in your router, you do not need to make a routing
decision on the rest of the packets in the stream. This means that
you can bypass the router's decision making engine.

The result is an improvement in throughput of several hundred
percent at little, if any, extra cost.

A six-slot GigaSwitch/IP costs less than US$60,000 and has a
maximum throughput of 5.3 million packets per second. This makes it
better than five times that of an average high-end router, which is
likely to cost almost double the price.

Another practical application for ATM which has developed nicely
over the last year or so is the use of ATM as a backbone within a
campus environment.

Using ATM as a campus backbone boils down to using it to
interconnect hubs within discrete areas, usually of departmental
size (say 250 plus users), of a campus. In this mode, ATM can
integrate data, voice and video services, but only for very large
sites due to the cost of the necessary high-end equipment.

Such equipment is still only available from vendors like Nortel-
although some traditional IT vendors such as IBM, which with the
high end of their Nways product line, are making inroads into this
market. As a data only solution based on PVCs, campus ATM backbones
are now relatively cost effective- even where the "campus" is a
large building.

This is particularly so when one looks at the cost of managed
ports, the ATM application used by most sites.

In addition, the advantages of ATM, such as extending VLANs beyond
a single hub, are other cost-effective factors that work in ATM's
favour.

VLANs in and of themselves are not generally of major interest to
the average network manager.

Capabilities of VLANs

However, the sort of capabilities they provide such as load
balancing across collision domains, isolating various types of
traffic or categories of users, logically distributing server-based
applications while physically centralising equipment, are
persuasive arguments for deploying systems with a VLAN capability.

For example, a university might wish to isolate student, research
staff and administrative traffic.

A VLAN built on an ATM backbone would permit each group to be
assigned a logically separate, campus-wide, network.

An interconnection between these networks could be made, for
example at some convenient central point via any appropriate
combination of routers and firewalls.

Such a network would need only a single media link, such as
ordinary multi-mode fibre, between each building in the campus,
perhaps similar links within larger buildings, and a series of VLAN
capable, hubs-DECHub 900s, 3Com sONCore or Bay 5000 are some
possibilities.

These could be connected either directly or via some form of third
party concentrator to the ATM backbone.

In the case of hubs, like the DECHub, which have tight integration
between their back plane VLAN capability and that of their options,
this requires the simple inclusion of an ATM switch option in the
hub.

VLANs created within the hub's backplane or option modules can be
extended across the ATM network with no more effort than
configuring the original VLAN.

In the case of hubs which do not have such tight integration, the
VLAN is created within the hub and a router option added.

This router is then connected to the ATM network in such a way that
the ATM network appears as several discrete logical ports.

This leads to the potential for the situation described in the
example above in reference to the potential for convergence
problems with routing algorithms.

Maximum Bandwidth

However, since the maximum bandwidth between the routers and the
maximum throughput of the routers is known (as we have maximum
performance figures for the routers and we would be working in a
campus environment where device latencies are either known or can
be easily measured) we could build such a network with sufficient
excess capacity to make the probability of flooding any one ATM
switch very low- not eliminate it, just make it very low.

Alternatively we could deploy a campus backbone in the form of a
device using Ipsilon's IP switching technology or something
similar, when such competitive products become available.

Digital may be the first to market this sort of technology but it
is unlikely that they will be the last.

In most other areas there has been little practical change in the
state of play with ATM.

LAN emulation continues to underwhelm anyone who looks at it too
closely, wide area ATM services are still mainly experimental and
of debatable cost efficiency to either the carriers or their
customers, and carrier level backbone ATM is still looking like a
world of static PVCs.

There is also the question of deployment time frames versus
standards developments.

In the wide area, carriers plan in terms of five, 10 or 15 years
for major changes to their networks and recovering the cost of such
changes.

In a campus environment, a carrier's customers typically require a
minimum of two to three years to recover the cost of new equipment.

Changing Standards

Standards change significantly within 12 months and such changes
require expensive upgrades or straight replacement of equipment.

ATM will not find the sort of general acceptance that technologies
such as ISDN, FDDI, or 100Base-T have.

On the other hand if, or when, the benefits of VLANs based on ATM,
Ipsilon/Digital's implementation of IP switching, or some other
generally useful application of ATM technology, find favour with
and are deployed by, a significant section of the market, the
process of standards development will slow to a more economically
expectable pace.

Stay tuned. The ATM World Series is far from over.

FORUM ON VOICE IN ATM

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

ATM for carriers: Is it real? According to Norman Gale, Nortel's
director of Magellan marketing, Asia-Pacific, the ATM forum's
discussions on ATM Adaption Layer (AAL) should be of interest to
telcos.

Said Gale, "To enable voice over ATM more efficeintly, the new AAL
6 is being proposed to code voice channels."

AAL 6 examines the streaming of multiple channels into ATM cells
and according to Gale, it is addressing two issues: Packing cell
density and minimising delay (echo cancellation).

"This will solve the issue of narrowband-to-broadband
internetworking," adds Gale.

Overall, the ATM wave in the Asia-Pacific is still in the testing
stages and according to Gale, it is in the backbone services that
ATM should figure prominently at the initial stages.

In the Enterprise market, Nortel is working on its ATM technologies
with Fore Systems.

Gale sees at the moment, 34 Mbps ATM may be next step for the WAN
market, which is increasingly being driven by newer technologies
like Frame Relay.

BAY TARGETS ACCESS EDGE MARKET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SIMON CHEW

BAY Networks is banking on the recent growth in the Internet and
Intranet markets to capitalise on an emerging need in the
telecommunications market.

At the recent Partnersphere Executive Conference held in Bali,
Bruce Sachs, executive vice president and general manager of Bay's
Internet/Telecom Access business unit, revealed that Bay is
targeting the access edge of service providers.

Said Sachs, "With our Baystream product, we can do both Routing and
Frame Relay (FR) switching on the same hardware, so that it is
possible to build one large network that provides both FR access
and leased-line routing or dial-up connections to the Internet."

Sachs added that this was useful due to the competitive nature of
service provision where the price of connectivity is becoming more
and more of a commodity. A network that offers both services will
then lower the cost of ownership for the provider.

With the recent acquisitions of Lancity, a cable TV modem vendor
and Penril's DSP modem business, Bay is now offering a software-
driven access architecture that is scalable and lower priced to
boot. Sachs sees personal video-conferencing as an application that
is beginning to take off here.

Said Sachs, "We again, have the ability to provide multiple
services from one hardware platform with software upgrade, thus
lowering costs and ownership."

Bay also sees an opportunity in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), in
the telecommunications sphere.

Based on their experience US-based Concentric Networks, (which has
VPNs in Europe and are looking for links in the Asia-Pacific), Bay
is confident that on-line services like interactive games and
banking will make an impact in the region.

Addressing the need of product differentiation by ISPs, Sachs
explained that Bay could offer ISPs a VPN solution that makes it
possible to attain a guaranteed QoS to their customers.

PHILIPS THROWS DOWN GAUNLET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

You get a new phone if yours does not work. This is the claim from
Philips three months after it introduced its first GSM phone
(Fizz). Philips has launched a line-up of new products as part of
its new aggressive marketing to capture market share.

In line with its aim to reach a 20 per cent penetration in the
Asia-Pacific markets, Philips has unveiled the First Choice
Programme, an extensive customer service support that guarantees,
in the event that your cellular phone fails to function, it will be
replaced within 24 hours, anywhere in the world.

Said Simon Roper, GM of Philips Consumer Communications (PCC) in
Asia-Pacific, "This is good for customers as they can use another
phone right away and distributor need not bother with an angry
customer. It will also be beneficial for operators as it minimises
their network losses."

Added Roper, "Our objective is to become one of the top three
manufacturers in consumer telephony by the year 2000."

The new products include the Spark GSM phone, boasting the longest
talk and standby time and offers a duo sim concept.

Said Roper, "The duo sim concept allows either a full sized SIM
card or a plug-in card to address the concerns of celluar users
today." Chalk one up for Philip's strategy to lure customers from
its competitors?

Other members of the product line include the Fizz Etac phone, two
new pagers, and a new DECT cordless phone, the Xalio.

For mobile data communications, there are now two new cards
available, the Mobile Data Card and the Twin Data Card.

Unique in the Twin Data Card is the option to switch between
cellular network and the PSTN via an adapter that allows normal
phone jack connection.

The new lineup will be manufactured in Singapore.

ORBCOMM SERVICES FOR ASIA REGION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

Subscribers in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei can use Orbcomm's
global 2-way messaging from 1998 onwards once Malaysia-based TRI
completes its US$8 million gateway late next year.

With twenty-six satellites  scheduled for launch next year, Orbcomm
users can send and receive real-time messages anywhere in the world
with US$1000 hand-held units equipped with GPS, LCD screen and
keypad.

The cost of this service, said Alan Parker, president of Orbcomm
must be close to the paging level for Orbcomm to succeed.

However, the larger market, said Parker, would  come from
industrial users, transportation and the search and rescue
services. For Malaysia, TRI believes that the main business would
come from tracking and data messaging services.

Added Parker, "The total market is divided into two basic user
types: machine-to-machine applications fro tracking and monitoring
where a sensor initiates the communication, and personal
communications services where an individual initiates the
communication."

Parker estimated the total market to be worth about 168 million
subscriber units with a third of the demand coming from Asia.

NEW ISSUES FOR NEW NETWORKS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BEN CHONG

The installation of full service networks (FSN) has thrown up
several new issues in test and measurements for service operators.

FSNs are networks set up to carry digital voice, video and data
traffic as well as establish a foundation for the future
interactive multimedia services much bandied about now. However,
according to Tektronix, cable TV operators learning to offer voice
services and traditional telcos who are going big with VOD are
encountering new issues when installing their core and access
networks.

Said Linc Reed-Nickerson, product marketing manager, Transmission
Test, Tektronix: "New services create new problems. Cable operators
and telcos understand their traditional services well, but they now
must learn how to optimise for new services."

FSNs are mostly based on the broadband Synchronous Digital
Hierarchy (SDH) technology, including new installations in China,
with architectures based mostly on a hybrid fibre/coax physical
media.

Tektronix says that the digital signal now contains a complex mix
of voice, video and data traffic which causes problems in the
transmission, if the test and measurement equipment used during
installation and regular maintenence of the network are not
sophisticated enough to capture and analyse the signals.

Compounding the difficulties is the fact that ATM and MPEG-2 are
the technologies providing video transport on SDH networks. MPEG-2
drop-outs are especially noticeable.

Said Reed-Nickerson, "In the analogue world, you could judge
picture quality from the video picture. In the digital world,
degradation sets in immediately, not gradually. The picture just
goes away suddenly."

A whole new barrage of tests are now essential, said Reed-
Nickerson. Timing and synchronisation tests are vital because of
the hybrid SDH/PDH networks and the fact that video and ATM-based
voice require high quality timing.

Jitter and wander test functions are now also essential to maintain
service quality measurements.Tektronix says that low frequency
jitter causes video subcarrier phase shift which causes colour loss
in the video.

In addition, hybrid analogue-digital systems produce distortions
associated with purely analogue systems. Some of these distortions
include composite triple beat, composite second order, cross
modulation and ingress. Newly introduced measurement devices, such
as Tektronix' Tek 2715 allow the pin-pointing of all such
distortions.

Operators also need to know that better indicators of signal
quality have to be used. For example, using raw Bit Error Rate is a
better indicator of system performance problems than using the
corrected BER.

Understanding the FSN is increasing at a steady pace in Asia. Said
Reed-Nickerson, "Last year operators asked about access network
testing only. Now questions about core network installation have
surfaced. It is an indication of the new digital services being
deployed such as ISDN and compressed voice."

LOW-DENSITY MARKET A FERTILE GROUND?

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SIMON CHEW

Wireless is undoubtedly the "in" technology of this decade. The
many cellular networks are testimony to the effective
infrastructure that it provides. However, the low-density market is
undermining its cost efficiency.

According to Steve Chen, vice-president, marketing of Celcore,
operators are able to achieve revenue targets from urban networks
due to the optimisation from the large number of subscribers. In
the rural market, operators have been reluctant to offer
sophisticated services.

Said Chen, "The low-density market may not be profitable as the
system may not be optimised."

In fact, most operators offset the costs by charging their urban
subscribers a higher price.

Celcore has identified the potential of the low-density market and
offers a solution for operators.

Taking a cue from the client-server (network centric) model in the
computing industry, Celcore offers a distributed network approach
to deliver wireless services without backhauling other networks.

The Globalhub from Celcore is an intelligent network platform that
functions as the Authorisation and Call Routing Equipment (ACRE) in
a cellular system (through IS-41) to offer advanced personal
mobility services and one-number access.

In addition, Celcore's Globalsystem product family supports
protocols like AMPS, ETACS, GSM and PCS and enables carriers to
tailor their networks according to the number of subscribers.

Said Chen, "We are evolving digital interfaces to support CDMA and
TDMA as well."

Leverage

With a regional office already in India, Celcore's latest venture
was a partnership with Thailand's UCOM, which, according to Chen,
will leverage on the latter's experience in system implementation
in the region.

The agreement calls for Celcore to offer turnkey solutions to
wireless operators as well as introducing UCOM as a potential
operating partner. In addition, Celcore has entered the Indonesian
market with a contract to expand Komselindo's AMPS network.

AT&T COMMITTED TO INDIA'S TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRY

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SHIRISH NADKARNI

IN the wake of the corruption controversy embracing former
telecommunications minister Pandit Sukh Ram, there are serious
doubts  whether the telecom tenders approved by the former minister
will be allowed to go through. But John Legere, president of Asia-
Pacific for the American telecom giant AT&T, has no doubt that the
projects which have already been taken up will be undisturbed.

#APT: Why hasn't AT&T done much in the long-distance telephony
segment  in India?

Legere: You may know that AT&T is a founder-member of the World
Partners Association (WPA), which is an alliance of carriers. Most
Asian PTTs are members of this alliance; and we are trying to
convince Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), the country's
overseas telecommunications arm, to become a part of it. VSNL is an
entity most suitable to serve our multi- national customers in
India, so we are looking at a partnership with it.

Once it is part of the WPA, we can work together towards seamlessly
serving the global needs of Indian customers, and also serving our
multinational customers in India. We will offer private line Frame
Relay and PTN services.

APT: But aren't there other similar alliances like, for example,
Global One?#

Legere: There is Global One, there is Concert. The model they offer
is more of an invest-when-you-can, ally-when-you-have-to type.
WPA's success has been substantial in Asia, where carriers have
felt threatened by other alliances, and have wanted to bind
together. We feel we have a formula that is best for VSNL and
India.

APT: Why has AT&T  missed the bus, as far as basic services are
concerned?

Legere: We had studied the Indian market for a full 18 months
before we bid for basic services in the telecom circles which
offered, from our  point of view, the most potential.

We contacted more than 10,000 customers, and did a massive amount
of technological research on Indian requirements. Even our bids in
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Karnataka were pretty aggressive-
perhaps more aggressive than any other multinational player.

But we didn't get the circles we wanted, and those were the only
ones we were prepared to bid for. Now that they are gone, we will
concentrate on wireless services in the two states we have and
establish our brand and service in India.

APT: Have you faced any major obstacles in the cellular arena?#

Legere: Well, we are definitely concerned about the allocation of
frequencies, and we have made these concerns known to the
authorities. They are urgent, day-to-day problems, but they have
not slowed us down. We are still on schedule to start our services
by Christmas. Meanwhile, we are optimistic that, if the government
has said it will address the problems we are facing, it will stick
to its word.

APT: Why has AT&T chosen to concentrate outside the US?

Legere: Look at it from the opposite side. Five years ago, India
did not even figure among the top 50 countries in the world, in
terms of usage of telecom services. Now the traffic out of this
country is expanding by leaps and bounds, and it is already in the
top 20.

We have estimated that, by  2005, India will be one of the three
biggest traffic streams to the US. Once the tele-density in India
and China grows, the traffic streams will be unparalleled and we
want to be part of the action.

APT: For the future, which other countries are you looking at,
especially in Asia?#

Legere: We have a thoughtful, focussed and aggressive globalisation
strategy; and have targeted countries we wish to go into. Apart
from India, we are building infrastructure in Canada and the UK.

So far as Asia is concerned, our largest investments are in India,
where we have made a commitment of US$1.5 billion. Our other major
investment in cellular services is in Hong Kong, where we have a
venture called Smartone.

We are also significantly expanding our on-line services in Asia.
We have advanced services delivered through the Internet in Hong
Kong, Japan and Australia. India is potentially a huge market for
Internet services, and if those licences are given out, we will
definitely be interested.

We are looking to bid in several other Asian countries, like
Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia, all of which
provide major opportunities. However, you must appreciate that we
have to pick and choose the places where we want to have major
investments; and, in Asia, we have consciously chosen India.

PLDT JOINS THE PHILIPPINE INTERNET BANDWAGON

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

THE Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) has taken
control of the Philippines' leading Internet Service Provider
(ISP)-an event greeted with dismay by ISPs and subscribers wary of
PLDT's embrace.

Infocom Technologies,  which claims 60 per cent of the Philippines'
infant Internet market, elected a PLDT man, Renato Gendrano,
president and CEO in September. Gendrano said the new owners wanted
to "accelerate the growth of Infocom's Internet business". Their
vision was to build a second Internet Backbone and to make the Net
more accessible.

Gendrano announced that Infocom intends to install 200 new digital
lines to give dial-up users faster access to the Net. He also said
Infocom would launch new products such as Philippine-wide roaming
access through a 1-800 number; e-mail to paging capability and pre-
paid Internet cards for international access. Funding will be
generated by the capital markets, loans and direct capital infusion
from PLDT.

Infocom subscribers access the Net via an E1 gateway with a speed
of 2.048 Mbps , the fastest and largest among all ISPs. Infocom
claims 3,000 direct subscribers. Add to this the subscribers
brought in by its 16 resellers and Infocom's total subscriber base
amounts to around 20,000.

Infocom expects this base to increase 15 per cent by end-1996.
Gendrano said Infocom is targeting an astounding 400 per cent
growth in 1997.

Small Slice of Pie

Whatever the real number of subscribers, the size of the
Philippines' Internet subscriber pie is far too small for the
booming number of ISPs. Industry estimates place the total number
of ISPs at an astonishing 79. In contrast, there were some 22 ISPs
last March and only 6 in August 1995.

About four-fifths of these ISPs are resellers who sell access to
the Net but who do not necessarily have all the hardware and
services of a major ISP. Both resellers and major ISPs are fighting
for a market estimated from 40,000 to about 100,000 subscribers.

Industry sources estimated the number of Net users at only 15,000
last March and expected this to double at year-end.

Internet access rates in the Philippines are cheap and the intense
competition is expected to drive prices down even further.

Executive Power Centre rocked the industry early this year by
offering access at only P90 (US$3) per hour and the same rate for
every succeeding hour. Infocom charges individual subscribers a low
P800 (US$30) per month and corporate subscribers P50,000 (US$1,900)
per month for leased connections. ISPs charge a one-time connection
fee that ranges from P90 to P50,000.

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM MUSCLES INTO PHILIPPINES TELECOM PIE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY PETER GALACE

DEUTSCHE Telekom has become a key player in the intensely
competitive Philippine telecoms industry with its equity
acquisition in Isla Telecommunications (Islacom).

Islacom is a CMTS and IGF operator lagging in its commitment to
install 700,000 telephone landlines by 1998.

DT becomes Islacom's second strategic partner after Thailand's
Shinawatra International.

Islacom Stake

Sources in Philippine telecoms speculate that DT will acquire a 20
per cent stake in Islacom at the expense of Shinawatra, which now
controls 30 per cent.

The remaining 70 per cent is held by Asia Communications Holdings
(Asiacom), a Filipino company controlled by the Delgado family.

Islacom has so far refused to confirm the extent of DT's equity
stake.

Islacom only acknowledges that it had entered into a "technical
partnership" with DT.

Simeon Kintanar, commissioner of the National Telecommunications
Commission (NTC) said DT is infusing both equity and technology
into Islacom.

Kintanar attended the signing of the joint venture agreement
between DT and Islacom in early September.

At press time, the signing ceremony was to have taken place in
Manila.

Islacom was identified by the NTC, the government agency that
regulates Philippine telecoms, as one of six companies lagging in
its LEC commitments as of the first half of the year.

Islacom has an obligation to install 130,000 landlines in 1996 and
443,000 landlines in 1997.

The company estimates that it will need P25 billion (US$1 billion)
for its LEC project in the next five years.

Following the signing of the joint venture agreement, DT advanced
US$40 million for Islacom's LEC roll-out programme and cellular
operations.

Industry observers say Islacom sought a second strategic partner
because Shinawatra is unable to extend the capital requirements
needed by Islacom projects in the next 10 years.

Islacom also has a licence for paging operations, but is not
actively engaged in this service.

Sources say DT may have cast its lot with Islacom because the
latter's LEC service area is one of the most lucrative in the
Philippines.

Cebu City is acknowledged as the Manila of the south and is
experiencing an economic boom.

Islacom's LEC service area in southern Philippines includes Cebu,
Mandaue, Negros Oriental, Negros Occidental, Siquijor, Samar,
Leyte, Iloilo, Bacolod, Bohol, Aklan, Antique, Capiz and Guimaras.

Lucent Agreement

The company recently signed a US$43 million agreement with Lucent
Technologies Philippines (an AT&T subsidiary) for its LEC project
and the improvement of its international gateway switch.

Islacom is one of five Philippine CMTS (cellular mobile telephone
service) providers.

It is ranked either fourth or fifth in the number of subscribers
and it has 40,000 subscribers to date.

BINARIANG AIMS FOR FULL SPECTRUM OF SATELLITE SERVICES IN ASIA-PACIFIC

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BEE-KAY SEN

MALAYSIA will launch its second satellite Measat-2 into orbit on
Nov 13.

It will be placed into the 148 degrees east orbital slot while
Measat-1 is currently positioned at 91.5 degrees   east.

"By putting Measat-2 at 148 degrees east, the footprints of the
satellites will be extended up to east Australia and Hawaii,"
Binariang's senior manager Abdul Halim Abdul Hamid said in Kuala
Lumpur recently.

Besides Malaysia, the footprints of both satellites will cover
Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. Binariang
is the owner and operator of the two satellites and has three
orbital slots.

Arianespace has been chosen to launch the satellite from the
European space port in Kourou, French Guiana. Both satellites are
manufactured by Hughes.

The second satellite has been flown to Kourou, where it will be
tested before being encapsulated into the Arianespace launch
vehicle, Ariane 44L, for launching. The launch vehicle will have a
co-passenger, Arabsat.

Additional Equipment

Additional equipment and a ground antenna is being installed at the
Langkawi control centre to accommodate Measat-2 as it will be in a
different orbital slot.

Binariang has invested RM600 million (US$235.8 million) for the
manufacturing and launching of the two satellites as well as ground
facilities.

Achieving breakeven for both satellites is expected to be in less
than five years.

Halim said besides leasing transponders, Binariang was aiming to
provide a full spectrum of satellite services with both the
satellites in orbit.

Binariang is considering providing Vsat (very small aperature
terminal) services by next year. It recently teamed-up with Hughes
to provide the terminals.

This is in line with providing rural telephony which can be linked
to the PSTN, via the satellite. Halim said this mode is more cost
effective as operational costs are lower.

Binariang is also forging alliances and partnerships with
international satellite and broadcasting players in the region to
lease satellite transponders.

Binariang is also considering launching Measat-3 by 1998, which
will be a much bigger satellite than Measat-1 and 2. Details are
being worked out but Binariang is aiming to provide global coverage
and a lot more capacity.

All the 15-Ku band transponders have been leased to its affiliate
company Measat Broadcast Network.

The affiliate recently launched the country's first 23-channel
satellite television and radio network known as Astro (All Asian
Television and Radio Company). Measat Broadcast Network hopes to
target 1 million subscribers (20 per cent market share) by year
2000.

It is anticipated that there will be five million homes with
television sets in the country by then.

More than 80 per cent of Measat Broadcast Network's revenue will
come from subscription fees with the remaining 15 per cent through
the sale of air time.

Measat Broadcast Network will levy an RM80 (US$31.44) monthly
charge for the 23 digital satellite TV and eight radio channels.
This is in addition to the one-off installation and equipment
charge of RM1,680 (US$660.24), which includes the satellite dish,
digital satellite receiver (DSR), remote control and smart card to
be purchased by subscribers directly from Philips, which has
exclusive rights.

Measat Broadcast Network needs an average of 700,000 subscribers to
breakeven.

"We can reach that figure in two and a half to three years' time,"
Measat Broadcast Network's chief operating officer, Paul Edwards
said, after the launch of Astro in Kuala Lumpur on Sep 25.

Measat Broadcast Network has so far invested RM500 million
(US$196.5 million) and intends to invest an additional RM500
million to expand Astro's broadcasting and production complex, the
All Asian Broadcasting Centre (ABC) and programming as well. Astro
will offer its services to neighbouring countries by early 1997,
Edwards added.

DTU Service

The direct-to-user (DTU) service can be made available to 30
million subscribers in India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia,
Taiwan and east Australia. However, Singapore is  not too keen on
the DTV service being aired within as it already has its own cable
TV network.

The Astro service is also an interactive multimedia platform
capable of delivering services such as home banking and shopping,
stock exchange information and Internet access as well. These
services will be introduced next year.

DSC DIPS IN THE FACE OF ORDER SLOWDOWN

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BENNY TAN

The stock of DSC Communications, a designer, developer,
manufacturer and marketer of digital switching, transmission,
access and private network system products, took a big plunge after
the company said its latest quarter results will not meet analysts'
estimates because of order slowdown and an inventory writeoff.

DSC's shareprice is currently at about US$17: Down more than 70 per
cent after a high of US$60 last year. Revenues are expected to be
at about US$330 million, with earnings at about breakeven. Wall
Street analysts are expecting US$0.24 a share. A year ago, earnings
were US$49.4 million or US$0.42 a share on sales of US$370 million.

Disappointing product sales included the Litespan-120, an
international loop access product and iMTN, a next-generation
digital cross connect. DSC is also taking an after-tax charge of
US$60 million to write off wireless products that cannot be used
because of interference with military equipment, as well as payment
for restructuring.

Last month, Alcatel won a contract with Motorola, beating out DSC.

Earnings are expected to be lower due to:

Lower revenues from Litespan sales driven by a drop in linecard
sales even though infrastructure sales increased.

Lower revenues from transport products, specifically for
traditional cross-connects due to purchase delays by customers.

Lower gross margins due to lower volume and a shift in product mix
in the Litespan area, from high margin linecards to lower margin
infrastructure.

Lower than expected initial demand for new products including
Airspan and iMTN.

Intelligent Service

DSC recently clinched a multi-million dollar contract to supply IXC
Communications, a suite of intelligent network equipment, including
its intelligent service peripheral (ISP), which combines features
of both service control points and intelligent peripherals.

The systems will allow IXC to offer 800/888 services, call routing
and customised account codes to subscribers.

New Advanced Solutions

DSC's new products which were demonstrated at the NCF InfoVision
'96 tradeshow included switched digital video (SDV), an application
enabling carriers to offer a variety of new interactive digital
video applications, including movies-on-demand, home shopping and
distance learning services.

Other new products in the access area are the Litespan 2000, 2012
and the Litecraft. Switching products include the iMPAX 5420 and
iMPAX 5001.

DSC also  demonstrated a portfolio of narrowband, wideband and
broadband transmission products including digital cross-connects
and transcoders.

MUTIARA'S PROGRESS

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

MUTIARA Telecommunications is coming along strongly with its plans
to be a more aggressive player.

This follows its partnership with Swiss Telecom.

Mutiara sprung a surprise announcement recently when it revealed
its plan to tie up with 60 property developers to offer domestic
and international services.

The tie up is expected to take place over the next two years.

These services will be provided to new development sites in the
country.

Mutiara marked its entry by recently signing up with the first
developer, Bukit Tinggit Resort.

Earlier, Mutiara had announced that its priority was to set up its
international gateway first.

It is believed that this gateway will be operational soon.

After it sets up its international gateway, Mutiara intends to
offer a fixed network service.

To date, Binariang is in the lead with 111 contracts. Other players
include Telekom Malaysia with 69 contracts and Celcom with less
than 60.

CELCOM IN SABAH

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

CELCOM has been awarded two contracts valued at RM74 million (US$29
million) for the implementation of a 2,000 km fibre-optic network
in Sabah.

The fibre-optic cable will be installed within the transmission
grid of the Sabah Electricity Board.

The two companies which will lay the cables and provide equipment
are Uniphone and Teknolite. Uniphone is a fibre-optic cable
supplier.

Celcom has formed a joint venture company- Celcom Timur (Sabah)-
with the Sabah state government via Warisan Harta. Work on the
project will commence soon and is scheduled to be completed in a
year's time.

The project will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will
cover 696 km including a 19 km long submarine network, while the
second phase will cover the remaining 794 km.

Celcom is the first company to set up a comprehensive fibre-optic
network spanning the state. It has a similar arrangement with
Sarawak Electricity Corp (SESCO) in the state of Sarawak.

TRI ANNOUNCES MEASURES TO STOP RAMPANT SHARE SPECULATION

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY BEE-KAY SEN

IN September, wild speculation surrounding Technology Resources
Industries (TRI) led to its share price taking a severe beating.
The counter registered the year's low of RM6.05 (US$2.38) on Sep
24-a 30 per cent fall in its share price.

Two days later, a foreign newspaper reported that TRI's deal with
Deutsche Telekom (DT) could hit a snag, further dampening the weak
sentiment. This coincided with speculation that DT had doubts over
TRI's prospects in an already overcrowded, highly competitive
sector. TRI refuted within the same day saying it would formalise
its deal with DT in October, thereby quieting rumours of its
troubled DT deal. TRI disclosed that it had signed the Management
Agreement, and Technical Assistance and Training Agreement with DT,
signifying DT's ready participation in TRI.

TRI executives are denying the allegation, but those close to the
deal revealed that DT had requested for a re-negotiation. DT has,
however, kept silent over the matter. A research analyst said DT
did not want to be left out of the booming Asian telecommunications
business and was keen to establish a foothold in Asia via TRI.

"It would not jeopardise its plans here just because TRI's share
price plunged. However if DT had requested for re-negotiations, it
was part of the provisions in the preliminary agreement between TRI
and DT in May  should TRI's share price come down", said the
analyst.

TRI announced on Sep 26 that it had revised the sale price per
share to be paid by DT from RM9.50 (US$3.73) to RM9.25 (US$3.64).
TRI said it will issue 68.07 million new shares which represents 10
per cent of TRI's existing paid up capital.

ING Barings analyst Soon Teck Onn commented that the price
difference was negligible and reflected DT's keenness in acquiring
a stake in TRI. DT had agreed in May to buy a 21 per cent stake in
TRI in two installments. The first installment will involve 68.07
million new TRI shares, while the second installment of the
remaining 11 per cent, will come from the existing shareholders.

Under the preliminary agreement, the price of RM9.50 (US$3.73)
could be re-negotiated if the TRI stock price slipped below RM7.46
(US$2.93) before the alliance agreement was sealed. DT will now pay
TRI RM629.64 million (US$247.45 million) for the 10 per cent stake
(or the first installment), instead of the RM646.66 million
(US$254.14 million). The entire 21 per cent transaction is tagged
at RM1.39 billion (US$546.27 million).

The remaining 11 per cent stake may be acquired by DT from TRI's
chief Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli.

VSNL ANNOUNCES US$1.27 BILLION TELECOM PLAN

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

by SHIRISH NADKARNI

BK Syngal, chairman of Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (VSNL), has
announced a Rs45 billion (US$1.27 billion) programme for telecoms
during the ninth Five-Year Plan (1997-2002).

The plans include projects for gateway switches, earth stations,
optical fibre cable systems, information superhighway nodes, DTH
systems and network management facilities.

There are also plans for a regional submarine fibre optic cable,
OASIS, to develop India as a regional hub for telecom traffic, and
to install state-of-the-art high capacity switches at metro
centres.

VSNL has already made commitments to expand its international high
speed connectivity through SEA-ME-WE-3 and flag optical fibre
systems.

Said Syngal, "At present, there is
a shortfall of about Rs25 billion (US$704 million) in financing the
expansion plans.

"Thus, we have proposed a re-launch of our Euro-issue of global
depository receipts. The proposal has been submitted to the DoT
after approval by the VSNL board."

The organisation registered a gross income of Rs44.73 billion
(US$1.26 billion) during the financial year 1995-96, and a post-tax
profit of Rs4.09 billion (US$115 million).

Syngal called for an attitudinal change and a more focused approach
on the part of its two key state-owned partners-the DoT and the
Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL)-in providing good service.

Maintenance Problems

"Although VSNL has been designated a single-window clearance agency
for leased line services, the maintenance of these lines has become
a problem because of co-ordination problems and a lack of co-
operation from the DoT and the MTNL," Syngal said.

BT LEADS ASIA-PACIFIC WITH FRAME RELAY CHARGE

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SIMON CHEW

British Telecom (BT), believes that Frame Relay services (FRS) are
growing due to the need for faster data transfers and an increase
in demand for LAN interconnections at lower costs.

Last month, BT launched its FRS in Malaysia with Telekom Malaysia
(TM) selling and managing the Concert portfolio of global data
services. So far, 30 FRS customers has signed up.

According to Dr. Mohd Khir Harun, senior vice-president, major
business and government of TM, "Through this strategic alliance, we
hope to offer global communications solutions, enabling companies
in Malaysia to compete globally."

BT has FRS in 11 countries and has 600 ports installed in the
region.

Ann-Marie Leyendecker, business line manager of BT's Asia-Pacific
data network business, said that new services like LAN-dial and
ISDN access will be offered soon.

"For ISDN backup, we are rolling the infrastructure to support this
right now, so by the end of the year, we will have 2 Mbps in the
core countries and by the end of April next year, it will be
available in all the countries in Asia-Pacific."

The next generation of dial-up services, due out next year,
according to Leyendecker, wil provide direct dial-up access into
FR.

JAPAN: DEREGULATES LEASED LINES

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY MIKE GALBRAITH

NTT has received authorisation from the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) to lift the final restriction on
connecting leased circuits to public telephone lines.

NTT has since offered a new service for companies to connect their
leased lines to its public lines from Oct 30.

This will have a major impact on the telecom service market in
Japan, leading to increased competition and lower prices especially
in the long-distance market.

Expectations

Many large corporations can be expected to set up in-house
telephone networks and to try to sell extra capacity to outsiders:
Matsushita announced the setting up of such a network early this
year. Fujitsu and NEC are expected to make similar announcements
soon.

The ban on leasing circuits to public circuits has long been one of
the main pillars of NTT's monopoly.

Under pressure to deregulate, the MPT permitted the linking of one
end of leased circuits to the public network from April 1995 and
NTT has been charging 9,900 (US$93) a month per circuit connection.

NTT's latest initiative can be seen as a move threatening its major
rivals among the new operators-the long distance carriers DDI,
Japan Telecom and Teleway Japan.

Indeed, NTT recently also announced that it would cut the circuit
connection charges to just 1,000 (US$9.40) a month.

The long awaited 100 (US$.94) per three minute long-distance call
could quickly become a reality. NTT's price, which used to be in
the 300 (US$2.80) range, is currently 160 (US$1.50) before taking
into account discounts.

THAILAND DEFERS SIX MILLION TARGET

from ASIA-PACIFIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS, Nov. 1, 1996, Vol. 9, Issue 11

BY SUTHISAK KRAISRI

Thailand's six-million fixed-line installation programme is being
pushed back for at least two years, following the reversal of
factors brought about by the current political turnabouts.

Both TelecomAsia (TA) and Thai Telephone & Telecommunication (TT&T)
had admitted out that the project, worth over US$4 billion would
not take place until after 1998. Both organisations made the
statement stating that there are currently ample telephone lines.

"TA, (having 2.6 million lines), will not sell out all of its
telephone lines until 1998," said Supachai Chearavanont, TA's
executive director.

Adisai Bodharamik, CEO of TT&T, (whose 1.5 million lines would be
fully registered by the end of next year), said, "Once you add the
Telephone Organisation of Thailand's (TOT) yet to be installed
800,000 lines, the market will be oversupplied in the next two
years."

At the end of September, the two private fixed-line operators
delivered their combined 4.1 million lines to the TOT, as committed
in their contracts, meeting the country's target of a 10 to 100
teledensity.

In addition, Adisai believed that "repeat orders" with TT&T and TA
would be likely when the demand rises. This means that any new
players would have little chance to enter the market.

Another factor which was said to have delayed the installation
programme was line registration. Registrations fell below target
partly due to the economic slowdown during the past year. The
result was that both operators could only sell less than half of
their ready lines by the second quarter of this year.

Due to the general election this month following the House
dissolution in late September, major projects have been put on
hold. Thus, TA and TT&T are enjoying a duopoly, at least until the
turn of the century.

However, there was a price to pay: The tight Sep 30 delivery
deadline forced the two telcos to spend heavily on telephone lines
construction. As sales were below expectations, their second
quarter performance disappointed investors.

"Their sales of telephone lines was slow, even in the fisrt
quarter. This means slower gains compared to growing operating
costs," said an analyst.

Mobile Market

Meanwhile, equipment makers have been monitoring market movements.
Suppliers like Lucent are concentrating on the mobile phone market
as the pending six-million line programme "will not happen soon,"
said a Lucent senior executive.
