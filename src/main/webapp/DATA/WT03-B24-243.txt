Scratch below the surface of the cultural gulf between Japanese pharmaceutical companies and biotech companies in the West, and there are two practical problems lurking: biotech companies can't wait as long as it takes for Japanese companies to do a deal, and the Japanese companies are uncomfortable with early stage technology.<p>
Rather than continue to try to fit a square peg into a round hole, Shinichi Tamura of Sosei Co. Ltd. (Tokyo) has set about to recarve the terrain. Sosei, together with an undisclosed Japanese pharmaceutical company, Rothschild's Biotechnology Investments Ltd., Schroder Pacific Technology Partners and Oxford BioScience Partners, set up a $5 million feasibility fund last summer to play the role of both investor, risk-taker and matchmaker.<p>
According to Rothschild's Jeremy Curnock Cook, the original concept of Sosei was to apply in Japan, where science and technology in academic institutions languishes for lack of commercial support. The plan, he said, was to buy rights from these institutions and then sell it to pharmaceutical companies. <p>
<b><center>Going outside</b></center><p>
Sosei raised the first fund ($5 million) in 1993 from BIL, S.R. One, Schroder and Oxford.<p>
The initial plan exposed the Americans and Europeans to what was going on in Japanese academia, and to see how ideas being developed there matched up with the investors' portfolio companies. "It was a way to pull out Japanese technology," Curnock Cook said. "It was all on a very unstructured basis -- a cross-fertilization."<p>
The program was designed as an experiment, Curnock Cook said, "and it has worked because Japanese universities don't have the same industrial interfaces that universities elsewhere have. <p>
"But it also let us say to Shinichi, 'While you're talking to Mr. Sumitomo, here are some other ideas from U.S. and European companies from our portfolios that might be interesting to Japanese companies, especially ones that weren't front-line pharmaceutical companies."<p>
He added: "You wouldn't go to Chugai and say they didn't have a sensible intelligence network. But you can go to a smaller company and have a conversation about that."<p>
From there, Tamura began to think about how to make a profit from the transactions and raised the second fund last year. The only way to build buiseness on in-licensing of technology from biotech companies to Japanese pharma companies was to become a principal rather than just an agent, Curnock Cook said.<p>
<b><center>Untapped market</b></center><p>
"He feels, and we agree, that there's an untapped market of Japanese companies who don't communicate well with the outside world, and therefore need an interface with someone like Shinichi," said Curnock Cook. "It's also important to make sure the Japanese client isn't disappointed, as happened in early deals when Japanese companies took over-promotion at face value."<p>
Even beyond problems of hype, overly polished presentations can be viewed with suspicion in Japan. "Business schools in the U.S. teach presentation skills," Tamura said. "In Japan and Europe, presentations are often still clumsy. In Japan, if we see a skillful presentation by a scientist at a business meeting, we tend to believe it's wrong. We still believe he has to be clumsy to be real."<p>
Building on this insight, Tamura came up with the idea of putting together a licensing fund that would commit itself to buying the rights to technologies, which it then would resell in Japan. <p>
His goal is to solve the very different problems of the two sides.<p>
Time is one of the critical issues for the biotech side. When biotech companies had larger and longer commitments of venture capital funding, they could tolerate the year to year-and-a-half of negotiations with Japanese companies that was typically required to put a deal together, said Tamura. But with a less certain funding environment, and the decision by many venture capitalists to limit their investments in individual companies, the wait has become more difficult.<p>
On the Japanese side, mid-tier companies have become increasingly fearful, Tamura said. They know they need new technology to develop globally acceptable drugs, and they know they need to capture some of it from overseas. The question is how to gain access to it, and then how to evaluate it. <p>
<b><center>Changing the model</b></center><p>
"By the time they decide to buy the technology, it's already been acquired by somebody else," he said. "So I said, 'Let's change the roles.' We'll make the decision. Sosei will acquire the technology first on behalf of potential Japanese clients. We'll function as if we were a general partner, and the clients could invest as limited partners."<p>
The fund has been structured so that Sosei typically can pay $500,000 for a six-month option, or tie its payments to milestones. "Then we work hard to close a deal with Japanese companies, or else we lose money," Tamura said. <p>
 "We know the needs in Japan, and we ask the U.S. and European companies what they want from a deal. Sometimes we pre-negotiate a deal -- for example the biotech company may want $10 million. Sometimes we just set a split -- for example, they get 80 percent and we get 20 percent."<p>
Sosei has reviewed more than 100 technologies thus far. Many of the initial proposals came from companies in the portfolios of Rothschild, Oxford and Schroder. In addition, Tamura asked the funds to show him some of the deals they had passed on.<p>
About 65 of the initial proposals came from U.S. companies, but it's been easier to work on deals for the European companies, Tamura said. <p>
"The pricing is higher in the U.S. because they are more sophisticated," he said. "The Europeans can take a $500,000 deal to start with, partly because the technology is earlier and partly because they have less infrastructure to pay for. We're telling some start up people in the U.S. to stay virtual for as long as possible. We can incubate the technology in Japan and leave the U.S. and European rights intact."<p>
Once Sosei has optioned a technology, it will spend three or four months introducing it to the limited partners -- the Japanese companies connected to Sosei. If they don't show interest, Sosei then is free to negotiate with any Japanese company. Even if the technology is licensed outside of the inner circle, the limited partners still will receive some distribution of the proceeds.<p>
Although the role of an Asian principal can help remove the hesitation of Japanese companies to investing in early-stage biotechs, the model also increases the comfort level of European investors who don't want to duplicate the U.S. model of venture investing. "Some European companies and European venture capitalists don't think the U.S. model is the best, but they don't know what else to do," Tamura said. <p>
"In the U.S., it's easier to raise a small amount of money to polish up technology, make it more sophisticated, then raise more money," he said. "In Europe, the technology and the presentation is often not as polished, but the underlying science is good. Europe lacks money and infrastructure, and a lot of scientists still think quick money isn't something they should pursue. Our model is one possibility for Europe."<p>
<b><center>Excess capacity</b></center><p>
The model also takes advantage of the excess development capacity in Japan, Tamura said, combining it with novel technology from the West. "In Japan, facilities are abundant and people are capable of steady development. In the bubble economy companies set up lots of capacity, and because of the culture, they can't lay off people. At the same time, they need innovative ideas to serve as a platform for new business. So the idea is to bring in new technology for development in Japan."<p>
"Shinichi sees this as a $500,000-a-pop exercise," said Curnock Cook. "It gives the biotech company a way to say it's been paid for the technology, and it gives him something to trade with. In our view, there is a demand for an entity that can interface in this way between Japanese companies that recognize they're being left behind and don't know what to do about it, and biotech companies that until recently were concerned about funding and didn't know how to get beyond Tokyo airport."<p>
Sosei has closed its first deal, between The Generics Group (Cambridge, U.K.) and an undisclosed Japanese company. Sosei bought an Asian option to Generics' discovery that it can use electric fields to denature DNA, and found the Japanese partner.<p>
The technology has potential applications in any area where it's necessary to denature nucleic acids, such as DNA diagnostics, according to Denise Pollard-Knight, divisional director of life sciences at Generics. The technology is rapid, and it simplifies the automation of different types of processes, she said. <p>
Generics is looking at other ways to apply electric fields to sample preparation in areas such as diagnostics, sequencing, probes and amplification systems.<p>
The company tends to look for partners at a very early stage of development, so it needs to find companies with the imagination to see the potential in its discoveries, Pollard-Knight said. "Several years ago we looked at working with Japanese companies, but it's very difficult with early-stage technology. It's not that we don't have Japanese partners -- we do have another Japanese contract, but in that case the technology is more developed."<p>
Company Chairman Gordon Edge said Sosei acts as an intermediary at a key stage in the development process. <p>
"Japanese corporations like to look at tangible pieces of technology, not concepts, whereas in the U.S. and Europe companies start projects at the 'exploring the concept' stage," he said. "That's very difficult to do in Japan. But demanding tangible technology can mean that by the time they're interested, you've adopted a manufacturing process that's not relevant to the ultimate partner."<p>
Sosei has identified the need to manage this intermediate stage, said Edge, "where you upgrade the technology to the visibly tangible stage, but it's not yet complete."<p>
In this case, Sosei continues to fund some of the development work for the Generics project, as well as acting as an intermediary between the two parties to the deal. <p>
Sosei Senior Director Ei Yamada is still heavily involved, said Pollard-Knight. "Sometimes he will act as a translator for 'coded' messages from the Japanese partner, helping us interpret what they really want. <p>
"He also helps to discuss the direction of the program and explain any changes. The Japanese are very good at later stage development and as a result mostly think about the details, which doesn't always get the improvements that we need."<p>
Sosei is about to close a second deal for Generics, and a third deal for a German company. In addition, it is in the process of purchasing three other options, two from European companies and one from a U.S. company.<p>
