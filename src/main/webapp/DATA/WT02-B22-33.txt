<H2 align=CENTER>What are your thoughts on drugs/drug usage?</H2>

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_DRUGS -->
<LI>I personally have tried very few drugs, but have seen their effects on friends and family. Some people become dependent on some drugs more easily than others do. I *do not* like most of the effects of most of the 'street' drugs on my friends. Incarceratin
<LI>I think drugs should stay illegal, I also think the authorities should have more stringent laws against the more dangerous drugs.
<LI>ALCOHOL KILLS SO FUCKING MANY PEOPLE. JUST SMOKE WEED!
<LI>I am proactive in AA. BUT, with early preteen education, 90% of the population could benefit from educated use and the GOV. would go away
<LI>take care
<LI>I use it every day and hate not being in control, to say this is to much.
<LI>Sober up BEFORE you drive or go to work; otherwise it's nobody's business but your own.
<LI>There is too much drug usage.
<LI>I see prohibition as creating the very problems it is supposed to solve. By creating a scarcity market and driving prices up, it creates a huge financial base for organised crime. Further, there is no possibility of quality control - death due to adulterated drugs becomes commonplace. Finally, it really is a metter of individual liberty.
<LI>Legalize Marijuana.  Alcohol is no less dangerous than pot--I drive better high than drunk, for example.  Other drugs, though,  we need to try something else--the War On Drugs has been a failure but not because the war itself is unwillable--we just have incompetent fools running the ship.
<LI>I wouldn't take that shit, but hey if there is no harm done, what is the problem.
<LI>It is nobody's business other than our own to decide what we will and will not put into our bodies. As long as someone is not harming anyone else in an immediate sense, it is their own business.
<LI>Kill ALL drug dealers!!
<LI>Prohibition fails to meet the needs of drug abuse in our society and should end.  Whether regulation, legalization, decriminalization, or whatever, replaces it, that's still to be decided.  But we have to stop putting people in jail for drug use.
<LI>They can lead to worse things.
<LI>Education starting around second or third grade, along with tough penalties and catching troublemakers before they become violent and into drug dealing and other major felanies is the only way to effectively lower drug use to where it was in the eighties.
<LI>It is certainly a problem in this country and seems to be more prevalent in the lower social-economic areas of this country. 
<LI>Drugs and alcohol are the root of all evil and stronger penalties should be used to deal with people who deal or do drugs.  Alcohol is too easily accessible also, that should be regulated more.
<LI>There is a difference between use and abuse.  It should be an individual choice whether or not to use drugs, and penalties should be assessed only in situations where abuse occurs.
<LI>Legalize but tax quite hard and campaign against use
<LI>Drugs that cause social degradation by causing individual degradation should be controlled while drugs such as ecstasy which motivate people and make people feel better about themselves should be more readily available.
<LI>Bin there, done that.  I don't recomend it.
<LI>I don't know about A majority of the drugs mentioned here but I don't see any harm in legalization of the ones that don't affect people besides the user.  People dont choose not to do drugs because they're illegal anyway. They don't do it because they don't want to. It shouldn't be up to anyone else what you do to yourself.
<LI>Drugs and drug usage can be very harmful when in excess and when involving the more mind altering types.  Whatever the drug, our main problem is dealing with addictions that are so strong that simply making a law  or enforcing existing laws is not going to help people get off drugs.s
<LI>Drugs are a choice a user makes. He or she is not harming anyone else.
<LI>To each his own
<LI>I do not support the use of drugs but I do support its legalization. No government has the right to make personal decisions for a person and it is clear that  widespread regulation of drugs has promoted its existance in society, if anything.
<LI>I think that many of the natural drugs such as tobacco, alcohol, caffine, marijuana, and hemp should either be legalized or remain legal.  The effects of marijuana so closely resemble the effects of alcohol that I personally do not see why one one is legal and the other not.  Too me the intoxicating effects of both these drugs can produce both positive and negative consequences when used.  I personally have turned to marijuana over alcohol because of the lack of physical addiction to marijuana.  I also
refuse to use marijuana to relax me or ease stress, as this is the easiest way to become mentally addicted.  I have yet to understand why in our society people feel that it is better to become physically addicted to nicotine and alcohol, with the blessing of the government, then allow the use of marijuana which is less expensive.  The hipocracy of many of the lawmakers and close mindedness of many citizens amazes me!!!  How can they pronouce marijuana as wrong and a 'gateway drug' without ever experiencing
it themselves.
<LI>Allow "classical" drugs like alcohol and tobacco. Ban the rest
<LI>It's a stupid idea to do drugs and for them to be allowed, well, as long as it's not  medicine you need that's not abused.
<LI>I think that drugs are cool.   All drugs should be mandatory for use by everyone.  Especially Rock cocaine.
<LI>I have never tried any drugs (except caffeine, which is not that bad) and I think that we should abolish these mind-altering substances.
<LI>I am 14, love chemicals. People should be able to do what they want without the government stopping them. I love marijuana and alcholhol and lsd. Less government spending to outlaw drugs. MAKE IT LEGAL! please. I beg of the government. 
<LI>Decriminialize marijuana and tax it as a way of reducing debt. However, politeness guidelines would have to be set up so that you don't have rude assholes smoking it everywhere.
<LI>As the parent of a teenager, I find myself much more wary of the things I consume (alcohol) because I do not want him to think that it's OK for him or his friends.  I have never consumed much alcohol as an adult and haven't tried pot or cigarettes in many
<LI>Whatever someone wants to do is okay until it affects others.  If you can use drugs in the privacy of your own home and it doesn't affect the safety of another person..more power to you.
<LI>I think that drugs should be legalized becauseit would cut down the crime rate, could provide the governments with badly needed tax money, and the drugs would not be as likely to contain things such as strycnine or other lethal chemicals found in street drugs.
<LI>marijuana should be legal and taxed like alcohol,age set at 21 and dui penalty for dumb drivers.
<LI>Used in moderation i think its ok.  Too many abuse drugs and alcohol and that leads to violence very often domestic. It can destroy lives.
<LI>It is an indicator of the state of society, street drugs are no accident, an effort to drug society is occurring
<LI>I think that drugs are stupid, and there needs to be stricter penilties to drug related crimes.
<LI>Substant abuse has this country in Chains of self abuse, self hatred and a loss of respect for ourself and it'S HAS DESTROYED COUNTLESS LIVES!
<LI>I think that we need to solve the cigertte problem first.  This is a legal substance, that is highly addictive and will kill you.
<LI>drugs and usage should be monopolized by the government, with strict regulation at low cost. This will remove the criminal incentive for stealing etc...
<LI>marijuana isn't as bad as the other stronger drugs. it isn't hurting anyone. i think marijuana should be legalized
<LI>Drug usage is a natural phenominon found, to some degree, in nearly every species.  To seak an altered state of mind and spirit is the basis of many religions and philosophies.  To wage a drug war on one's own people is a crime against the very freedoms our country is founded to uphold.  The prosicution of one man for getting high, by another man who goes home to his alcohol and/or pills is hipocritical and unjust.  This country needs to stop protecting it's citizens from themselves and allow us the fr
edom guarenteed by our constitution.
<LI>I do not care much for drinking anymore. I will have a few beers monthly but do not feel the need or urge to drink to get drunk anymore. I am strictly anti-pot now & strongly believe marijuana is addictive in the long run & should never be legalized. Kids already can get ahold of it somehow, it doesn't need to be made any easier for them.
<LI>They should legalize some drugs.  And they should lower the age limit for alcohol.
<LI>I use to be a heavy user of drugs and alcohol, until I got saved ,(born again) in July 1985 at the age of 24. I believe that is the only answer to the problem in America!
<LI>as above
<LI>They are all dumb and have adverse affects. It is best to say away from them.
<LI>I enjoy recreational drug use and still lead a productive life. Counselling should be made readily available for everyone who can't cope with problems in their life, be it drugs, alcohol, or whatever may be causing them grief.
<LI>The Government should be tougher on repeat drug offenders
<LI>Any addictive drug (with the exception of alcohol which I do not believe to be addictive if used in moderation) should be illegal, including tobacco.  
<LI>The drugs business today is the same as alcohol during prohibition. It is a sleazy and dangeruous underworld. Drugs have been found to fuel crime among users, such as theft, prostitution and assult. It also fuels more serious crime among dealsers and distributors. Clearly, legalizing certain drugs will go a long way to control their use as proven in trials with heroin in places such as Geneva and Amsterdam. 
<LI>hey, if you like it.......
<LI>Drugs should be legalized and regulated in order to eliminate the crime associated with drug smuggling, and dealing.
<LI>Drugs cause most of society's problems today
<LI>I am very against drug usuage.  It is harmful to society in a lot of ways.
<LI>Drugs overall are harmful, but the law enforcement where I live is more harmful!!!Especially siince they indulge too.
<LI>Depends on the person.If you can handle it do if you cant stay away.
<LI>Legalize all psychedelics, at least. I wish marijuana t and It's so stupid that marijuana is not yet legalized for all! I can no longer afford it but I miss it and still like it! It is especially great for listening to music! Ecstasy is kind of a ripoff -
<LI>There is no simple solution, but all solutions should be attempted, and if they have validity, adopted, even if the value is limited.
<LI>crime is up because of the legalities-legalize them!
<LI>Ques.#3 doesn't allow for those of us who may have beer OR wine with a meal depending on the meal
<LI>permisive cultures don't seem to have less problems then nanny cultures
<LI>Anything in excess is bad for you, Regaurdless the substance.  Use moderation and you will go far.
<LI>Life is fun enough without altering your conciousness - deal with it!
<LI>Use of intoxicants are the result of a deeper social problem rooted in a desire to escape the reality of suffering forced upon many by a growing gap between rich and poor, the devastation of the environment from our backyards to the rain forests, an economic system that rewards greed and punishes humility, and our own internal struggle between our natural desire to find happiness and the unhealthy ways in which western industrial societies often teach us how to "succeed".
<LI>Everything depends on the person who chooses to indulge.  What I mean is this.  You take someone who is very mentally unhealthy, put them into ANY situation where the results are not in black and white, thenyou have a problem.  Its like the old saying, gu
<LI>any illigal drugs should stay illigal. alcohol is good if you don't abuse it.
<LI>I think that the mexican border should be more watched for drug dealers and drug dealers get the death penelty
<LI>STUPID!
<LI>The drug war is a war on people. It is dealt with stupidly by authorities. If the government doesn't want drugs in the country, they should stop producing them, selling them to our people, taking them back, and selling them again.
<LI>We should concetrate on users not dealers (no demand no offer)
<LI>Education is neede to deglamorize the drug world.  Some illegal drugs do have positive uses and these should be examined.
<LI>Tobacco should be slowly ilegalised
<LI>Drug are good for you so use them daily.      Just kidding.
<LI>Drugs and other such elements are fine if used in a correct fashion.
<LI>I was raised by a domineering religious fanatic so I like to 
<LI>Drug usage should be regulated by society, not government.
<LI>Misuse of drugs and alcohol cause crime and heartbreak.
<LI>People will always abuse we are excessive by nature we only learn to moderate.Like the commercial says when we are born all we know is stop and go-full throtle.Addicts will infect and they will die.Alcholics will infect and die.Both leave behind a bitter,broken legacy of pain,torment,confusion,self doubt and intolerably low self image.There is no way out but to want to get out.To the end the educated and literate,the strong of heart,mind,body and soul will prevail.The weak will rot,infect and infest be
ore their own eyes.The strong control their own destiny, the weak follow the destiny others cast upon them.
<LI>As the former spouse and former girlfriend of men who have abused both alcohol and drugs, I have seen, firsthand, the adverse affects it has on family and friends.  Somehow I seem to attract people who use, even though I no longer use myself.
<LI>Hard drugs should be forever outlawe.
<LI>I don't like to use it any,ore
<LI>I personally feel that our society would be better if drugs were legalized in the US
<LI>The effects of drugs are powerful and highly personal, varying greatly with the individual and the situation.  I would like to see marijuana legalized for individual growing and gifting, but I would hate to see it legalized for commercial distribution or taxed.  Education is essential to encourage people to use drugs responsibly.
<LI>Drugs are a serious problem in society.  People need to realize that it is due to the break-up of the core of family values.
<LI>Re-instate Prohibition!!!!
<LI>A problem because people are spit on whether it should be treated with seriousness or not.  Those who do crap are agiainst reglations, those who stay away aer in favor of regulations.
<LI>they are things that really screw up your life
<LI>I experimented with drugs a great deal in my youth. I am now a responsible adult and a valuable asset to my community. As a youth I greatly resented my goverment for making me a criminal with there drug laws. Now that I have children I worry more over the possiblity my children could be involved with the law then I do over the possibility they might smoke some pot. A goverment that makes criminals of such a high presentage of it's youth is not a ligitiment goverment in my eyes.
<LI>harder drugs are mentally and physically harmful, however, "soft" drugs like marijuana have not been proven to be harmful.  Legalizing it would be fine by me.  Drugs are a social and psycho problem.
<LI>Most illegal drugs should be legalized and taxed.  Reduce crime and increase tax revenue!
<LI>There are benifits to the drug problem in America because there is a lot less competition in schools and the workplace due to the loss of so many brain cells
<LI>I live in a small area, so we don't have too many problems here.
<LI>Intoxicants have always been with us. If all current drugs, including alcohol and caffeine were criminalized, humans would find some new way of getting high - snorting dandelions perhaps. 
<LI>drugs are what you make of them as long as you are in controll have fun and experiment
<LI>I used them a lot for a few years, and speaking from MUCH experience, I think, in general, they are evil
<LI>Marijuana is great because you can't overdose on it.  Drugs such as cocaine and PCP are very dangerous and should be sold only in very small amounts for special occasions.  Tobacco and Alcohol are okay, but stronger penalties should be placed on drunk drivers.  
<LI>Very few people are able to handle drug usage responsibily, including those in the medical field
<LI>individual & responsible choice
<LI>I believe choices for drug/alcohol use should be left to the individual UNLESS or UNTIL their behavior infringes on the rights of others.
<LI>The drug problem does exist, but has been blown so out of proportion by government, church, parents--society in general.
<LI>We waste far too much time and money prosecuting drug offenders while violent criminals go free. America, wake up.  If an adult wants to take drugs and they're not hurting anyone else it is their decision.  Let's concentrate our efforts on real criminals!
<LI>Well, if it's done with in reason it's fine with me. But if it's taken out of porportion it could be hazardous to your sel and others.
<LI>moderation education tolerance
<LI>The movies they showed us warning us about drugs made me want to try them.  Especially when I found out that smoking pot did NOT make you hallucinate and run in front of cars, I figured everything else must be lies as well.  There should be more truth.  Drugs never hurt my life, and although I don't do them now (too hard to find, really, I should go back to high school!! ;-)
<LI>DRUGS SHOULD HAVE A HARDER PENITY
<LI>People should be responsible for their actions when abusing drugs or alcohol.  We as a society want the benefits of freedom but not the responsibility that comes with freedom.
<LI>I think a little bit of marijuana can't hurt someone. You have to know your limit though.
<LI>marijauna should be legal, all powder drugs remain illegal
<LI>I'm High
<LI>Drugs are evil and need to be destroyed!
<LI>Certain drugs, marijuana in particular, should be legalized. This country spends far too much on "The Drug War."
<LI>Personally I think that drugs that have no adverse affects on the body and aren't addictave should be freely available.
<LI>Marijuana is less harmful in my eyes compared to alcohol, and therefore, should be legalized!
<LI>Without suppliers there will not be users.
<LI>No one has the right to tell me what I ingest into my body. That is my choice. Therefore all substances should be legal and the damm government should get of our backs.
<LI>I love drugs mann.!!! THEy mak me feeel bettter..,.
<LI>The only way to fully regulate and control the quality and distribution of hard drugs is to make them legal and therefore regulated by government standards of safety.  This would also force the issue into the light and make education a necessity.  This is
<LI>mary jay should be decriminalized
<LI>IF A DRUG OR DRINK CAN HELP A PERSON RELAX OR DEAL WITH A SITUATION, WITHOUT HARMING OTHERS, THEN LET IT BE.  THERE SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM WITH RESPONSEABLE DRUG USE.
<LI>If you're stupid enough to regularly abuse illicit drugs then you deserve what happens to you.
<LI>The use and distribution of drugs in lower class areas is quite different than that of poorer areas. Through increased income of the poor, the use of drugs would be more for entertainment than escape.
<LI>I do not personally use drugs, but I don't see why others shouldn't be able to.
<LI>I think drugs should be legal and have laws that prevent a horrible backlash of problems due to legalization - I think legalization would cut down crime enormously and it would get a lot of addicts help because they no longer feel that they have to hide their habit - if it was legal after while people will look at addicts as people who have no self control because then there would be no shame in using just abusing!!
<LI>It's a personal decision and free exchanges of information should be easier ... too many people know too little about drugs.
<LI>i think that marijuana should be legalized. I don't feel this way because i'm an addict either.  I also feel that the answer to the drug issu eis more education, such as showing bad results besides ending up in jail.
<LI>i think that drugs should stay illegal and educating our children is the best way to ensure that they don't try drugs.
<LI>it's gotten more attenyion in the ;ast ten years, but requires more funding to stop it's abuse, especially among younger people.
<LI>Drugs should not be legalized.  
<LI>our culture is very consumed with the use of drugs and alchol. They are not fun, glamerous, or cute. Some people can drink on a social level and for them it's fine, for others it's not fine. And drugs ruin lives.
<LI>It really is up to the end user.  We can't always blame society for an individuals habits, though we should try and assist them.
<LI>NOT MUCH
<LI>usecaution
<LI>peoples in general should not be so paranoid about druguse!!!!
<LI>Drugs need to be limited to those prescribed by a physician, not including any minor drugs like aspirin or cough suppressants.  We need more stringint enforcing of present drug laws.
<LI>no comment
<LI>Drug use is a personal choice, that I feel the government has no place in, other than controlling availability to minors.
<LI>Adults should be able to decide if they want to use drugs or not. Alcohol, a legal drug causes more hurt than any other.
<LI>People should be made aware at a young age the effects of drugs on their physical & mental health. There would be no dealers if there weren't any users. Education & peer pressure are the keys.
<LI>Most drugs are OK in moderation. Any drug, any thing in fact can become addictive if you make a habit of it, and an addiction of any kind is a bad thing.
<LI>Can't take away the only fun people have.
<LI>They should not legalize.  It is destroying the moral fabric of our country.
<LI>i feel certain drugs should be legalized for medical treatment purposes only. other drugs that are being abused should be tightly regulated. those caught abusing those drugs should be punished and counciled so it would be very unlikely for the abuse to happen again. 
<LI>the war on drugs is a useless and frivoulous one, the world has always had a facination with drugs and it could never be suppressed , I think that lenient approaches such as those of the Netherlands are the only plans with any chance of success. I laudit their policies and suggest that the U.S. follow in their footsteps!!
<LI>Take drugs till it kills you than take drugs until it kills you again. Drugs should  be free , so the world can live in peace and anarchy . If more people would use drugs than we could give them a better chance of killing themselves than people could get high on life . its all the same so take drugs and take them again the world needs more people like that so something can be done . hahaha!!
<LI>In Britain the rules concerning drugs are too strict
<LI>Drug use is a matter of personal responsibility.  Most substances should be available to the public, but individuals should be held accountable for the choices that they make.  This is an issue of self-control more than legal control.  Unfortunately, some
<LI>Drugs can be a good thing as long as they ae not abused.
<LI>I'd like to see more severe punishment for drug dealers.  We need to stop illegal drugs coming into this country.
<LI>Drugs are a stupid of a persons life!
<LI>Tobacco is more harmful than pot, it should be decriminalized
<LI>Certain drigs should be legalised to reduce crime by pushers etc. Special treatment centres should be set up to freely administer certain drugs to victims to get them off, without resorting to crime.
<LI>used in moderation, soft drugs and alcohol help people relax 
<LI>i think that marijuana should be legalized, but only available to 18+. my expirience with marijuana has always been positive. i, nor any of my friends, have ever committed a crime while under the influence of marijuana.
<LI>Moderation is the key.
<LI>People should have a more rational approach to the drug "problem"; focus on the serious issues rather than worrying about "drugs" such as cannabis that does much less harm than alcohol.
<LI>All drugs should be legal, regulated and taxed. All efforts to control abuse should be educational. Cars kill/injure far more people, but where's the furor over vehicles?
<LI>It's difficult to freely explain my views, I'm under-age(17) in a society that doesn't openly except the freedom of choosing your own route to enjoy life..yes, I'm high--Get over it,I have--To each his own  MANY HAPPY DAZE TO COME FOR MEEEE!
<LI>Anything which becomes legal will be used to excess and we will have even more fatalities.
<LI>Alcohol should be leagalized for all people.  There should be stricter laws dealing with the indirect effects of alcohol such as drunk driving and addiction.  
<LI>Alcohol as well as tobacco laws need to be stricter. Underage minors have way too much access to these. Stricter regulatory laws and misuse penalties are needed.
<LI>Press and Govt. overreact against drug use/misuse as an easy excuse for crime, poverty, unemploynment and to stimatise whatever section of society they find convenient.
<LI>Theyre not for everyone, some will abuse and ruin it for everybody else
<LI>I think that the Western world's attitudes to drugs actually makes it more attractive to a lot of people. Legalisation of even the "hard" drugs may not actually increase the number of users and then the situation could be far more easily contraolled.
<LI>I think there is a downside  to any drug consumed,I think the laws are too strict to the people caught, and people need to be more educated on all of it. 
<LI>I'm curious as to why marijuana and alcohol each had listed as a choice "It makes me uncomfortable and/or paranoid" and cocaine did not. Cocaine _only_ makes me uncomfortable and paranoid.  My personal drug and alcohol use has been from social to escapist. I have quit most everything I used to do except alcohol and though I
<LI>Forbidding anything increases its use, and such laws cause people to lose respect for all laws.
<LI>DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA; TRY TO FOLLOW EXAMPLES OF EUORPEAN COUNTRIES (NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL ) TO TRY TO BREAK THE TREMENDOUS ILLEGAL PROFITS MADE BY ORGANIZED DRUG CARTELS.
<LI>I don't use illigal drugs, but I know how difficult it was to stop smoking if you seriously want to discontinue using drugs  you can, after all it's your body that you are destroying and it's your friends that you are loosing.
<LI>I think many people use drugs as teenagers for the sole reason that it is illegal. Legalizing drugs may increase use at first but, then it would decline. HOwever, the people that are already addicts would have no chance at recovering.
<LI>I think people should learn to live more naturally.  Sure, I drink coffee, and drink a couple times a year, but could definately do without.  I don't know why people have to take themselves to another mental state to be happy.....I don't understand it, an
<LI>It is a shame that people are ranting and raving about drugs.  Everyone has an opinion, almost none are educated opinions.  How many people out there know how opium came to the "New World"?  How many people out there know why they were criminalized - (one
<LI>The current laws are insane, and costing too much money for enforcement and incarceration.
<LI>They are poor substitutes for learning to accept and deal with ourselves and our problems.  Drinking doesn't wash away problems instead it irigates and makes them grow.
<LI>If you want to, go ahead, just don't get caught
<LI>I think there should be mandatory detox treatment for people arressted for serious, harmful drug use. Let's crowd the prisons with the dealers instead of the users.
<LI>Pragmatism and medical informaton as the basis of any and all decisions on drug policy. 
<LI>it's a shame that people have to resort to drugs
<LI>most of our problems would be eased if the majority of illegal drugs were legalized.
<LI>I would MUCH rather have my child use marijuana rather than alcohol. There are things that are much worse for us, that are legal!
<LI>I am a firm believer in INTERNAL FREEDOM.  The problem with the U.S. is tha we are so interested in what everyone else is doing to their own bodies.  Face it some humans will never help themselves...I think it's time to legalize all and live for ourselves .  Let the junkie die.  Experiment, but keep a strong mind and no one gets hurt...
<LI>drugs are bad for me but pot seems to  take the place of my doc. and his downers
<LI>Chances are extremely great that they will cause you to be non-functional in other areas of your life.  There will be no balance.
<LI>drug use is not a crime problem; it is a public health problem.
<LI>If people are actually smart they will eventually quit, however everyone needs to experiment a little .. If they get themselves addicted or to hardcore drugs, it is their own damn fault and they should just be ignored from society entirely.
<LI>I think it is wrong for me to use drugs, since their are illegal.
<LI>both can become a hardship to one that indulges in it, but we must remember there are hardships in most vices and most people seem not to realize that.
<LI>stupid people do drugs
<LI>I intend to never again use illegal drugs, alcohol or nicotine.  Prescription drugs, used as prescribed, and caffiene are okay.  14 years of my life were wasted in the drug/alcohol scene while I was trying unsuccessfully to numb an emptiness and pain that only the Lord could (and HAS) healed.
<LI>My religion teaches against the use of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.  I, of course, make my own decisions, but this guidance has kept me out of a lot of trouble.  I don't know if just education is the answer.  There will always be adicted people and people wanting to make money that will be selling and doing drugs.  I wish there were an easy answer.
<LI>The problem with drugs is not the drug itself, but that the drug is illegal.  When there is a demand, for anything, someone will supply it.  Make it legal and you eliminate the criminal element.
<LI>Many people I know smoke mArAjuAnA.. they think everyone should smoke it
<LI>I use alcohol and tobacco.  I do not use drugs, but feel if people want to ruin thier lives with drugs--let them have them and stop making drugs a criminal activity.  Perhaps this will stop the increases in dealers
<LI>Marijuana is O.K.  Cocaine and other drugs blow your life all to hell.  Peer pressure got me to use drugs.  But I decided my grades and real friends are more important.
<LI>I think we need to teach our youth that there is nothing good about taking alcohol or drugs in any amount.
<LI>There are times when durgs need to be used.   Learning what drugs you can use and when to use them is hard.  Most poeple do not understand how chemicals react in people and what makes the same drug react diffrently in diffrent poeple.
<LI>The drug war is a failure, and it is misdirected
<LI>People should have a right to fry their brains, but not to drive with fried brains.
<LI>I feel very little pity for people with illegal drug habits, they are illegal to begin with so they shouldn't have started.  Alcohol is OK in moderation like most things.
<LI>Uhh... since my use is extremely limited, I gues sI don't have an opinion... I hate to be around people who are ona substance when I am not though... makes them seem so stupid!
<LI>I feel that it is the choice of the individual. Personally I feel that it is a bad choice.
<LI>They're a shame and a reality.  We must continue to educate about the horrible effects of usage and address how to help families who seem to be predisposed to have problems.  Great if we could kill the addictive gene in people.
<LI>Extremely complex issues.  
<LI>It's safe to say that all drugs are harmful to your health. In my oppinion, people should have access to nicotine, alchohol, marijuana but should always be controlled.
<LI>My thoughts are that if you want to do it on your own time, go ahead, but not when it will impact on your job, and if I catch you selling to my kids, put your head between your legs and kiss your ass good-bye.
<LI>any drugs for terminal patients to relieve pain
<LI>There should be better laws for drug use.
<LI>I have only one friend:  my marijuana.  Without it's ability to relieve my stress, I would be nothing but a pile of bones in a wooden box 6 ft. under.
<LI>i think it depends on the person taking the drug and how well they can handle it.  some people are just not able to handle them, therefore creating problems, such as addiction.  i do not, however, think it should be so easily accessible, especially to the
<LI>THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENCE OR THE PROBLEM WILL CONTINUE TO ESCALATE.
<LI>I think that the personal cultivation and use of Marijuana should be de-criminalized nation-wide for adults. Exchange of small amount between adults should be legal as well.  I agree with laws that restrict the operation of motorized vehicles under the influence and use/sale by minors.  I think this is a good first step short of whole-scale legalization.
<LI>As a casual/sometimes MJ user, I see a lot of people around me who can't handle it. This is why it ought to stay illegal.
<LI>I believe everyone encounters drugs and alcohol in their lives, and I find nothing wrong with occasional use.  I believe that drug and alcohol experimentation is almost a necessity in order to mature.  It is when that use becomes abuse that drugs become a problem, and people need to know where to go to get help.  Then it becomes a psychological problem rather than a sociological one.
<LI>Drugs should be legal, but business should be allowed to hire/fire persons based on usage.
<LI>I think consistency is the key. MArihuana is singled out, while alcohol and tobacco, because of teh BIG MONEY backing them is completely legal. When is the last time someone smoked MArijuana and then killed someone? Who has ever died from Marijuana usage. There is a double standard that should not stand.
<LI>I enjoy them on a daily basis.  I enjoy the 'high' from them also.  I've noticed that a lot more people are doing it.
<LI>It is a bad habit and there should be harder penalties for illegal users and dealers.
<LI>I think people are using and abusing to much, try to find a way to get thru life a little bit easier. 
<LI>I think that drug usage in moderation can be quite harmless.  I also think it is absurd that alcohol is legal and marijuana is not.  Who was the genius that came up with this scheme?  Probably someone with a drinking problem!  Marijuana seems so much less harmful than alcohol and other drugs.  I've never met a violent or beligerant stoner!
<LI>they are fun if used in moderation
<LI>know what you are getting into
<LI>I do not consider wine or beer a drug and I resent it being included with crack and LSD
<LI>Drug testing is bad because you should have a right to do whatever you want on you're time off.  Drug use depends on the person because we all react in many different ways than the guy next to us to many different drugs.
<LI>drugs are dangerous, not healthy, and people who are adicted to drugs are never in there right state of mind and need to seek help and relize how great lfe can be without drugs.
<LI>Drugs arent worth the time and the losses. 
<LI>The war on drugs is the source of many problems in our country, and if it was stopped, there wouldn't be the problems we have with crime and gangs.
<LI>Control of drugs is more effective and allows socity to supply help when needed. While the converse forces the problem user to hide and not seek help.
<LI>WHen used responsibly, drugs and alcohol are not a problem.  Unfortunately, there are VERY FEW people who know how to handle them responsibly.
<LI>Drugs are a form of escapism.  People that use them don't have anything better to do with their time.  Nevertheless, it's a personal choice, and if somebody wants to get messed up, it's their perogative.  If they want to smoke crack, let them die.  It's their fault.
<LI> I think that the key to life in general is, All good things in all good time.  All things in moderation.  If you get to caught up in using any drug, or eating too much food you are liable to get yourself into trouble
<LI>I'm not interested in drugs, but I don't recognize govt authority to regulate
<LI>Education on drugs is skewed.  I agree that things like crack are dangerous, should be illegal, and that people should be warned about the dangers of using them.  However, pot, lsd, etc., in my experience, are not particularly dangerous, nor are they immoral or a threat to society.  Government education programs which put across the idea that all drugs are equally dangerous do not make any sense, and I think that people tend to disregard warnings about the more serious drugs (ie. crack, heroin) because
they realize that the warnings about drugs like pot are completely over the top.  
<LI>I  feel the drug use is a result of poor self esteem as a result of the decay of the family and its values.
<LI>I drank alcohol and used marijuana in my youth and early adulthood.  I think it's ridiculous that marijuana is illegal.  Alcohol is much worse. 
<LI>hard drugs such as herion and smack shouldn't be so readily available; pot makes you high (sure it is also addictive) but not one person has died directly as a result of smoking it. I don't care whether they legalise it or not...it people want to smoke it...THEY WILL! :-)
<LI>About 4/6 of the people I know at school actively do drugs and about half of that come to class under the influence.
<LI>Having used many drugs in the past I feel some should be legal
<LI>I don't believe drugs should be legalized because they are very addicting.  Alcohol is not addicting unless you have a disease.  I do believe that we should be informed on the effects of alcohol, to keep it illegal to drink and drive, but alcohol as a whole should be legal.  It is as safe as an over the counter drug.
<LI>some should be legalised for people with stress problem.
<LI>MATURITY SHOULD DERTEMINE THE USE OF ANYTHING
<LI>moderation!
<LI>Drugs should lie completely under the control of the taker. It is not the place of government or the medics to prohibit people from taking things which they enjoy. The only cases I can see in which limits should be placed on the taking of drugs would be for passenger-jet pilots or other professionals responsible for the safety of others. I am very stoned at the moment and I do not feel that it has been detrimental to my mind or body in any way, except that I can't get enough grass and I have to smoke a
hash-tobacco mixture. 
<LI>The weak of mind can not cope, thus it probably should remain as it is. 
<LI>The "war on drugs" has been a counterproductive, hypocritical exercise in futility.
<LI>Society is sick if drugs use is required for survival.
<LI>Should all be inforced as illegal!
<LI>Drugs have adverse physical and emotional effects, and should be avoided entirely.
<LI>Drugs ARE dangerous to both mental and physical health. I dont think that legalizing or permitting drug usage is the way it should be controlled. Im not even sure, that it can be controllable. Legalizing those so called 'soft drugs' (hash, marijuana, etc.) is definiately dangerous. As the surveys show: todays 'hard drug' users all started with soft stuff, and then they went further and further. Nobody starts with sticking pins to their arms, but most of the previous marijuana users  are becoming seriou
 drug(and i mean the hard stuff) addicts later. i think its because people learn that they can control their mood with various substances(starts with alcohol, probably?), and as time passes, using drugs becomes more and more common and natural to the person. Second: i dont think, that drug users should be punished for what they do - people drink, people take sedatives, others smoke - and these are socialy accepted. The ones this questionaire is about are not, but some of them do not really differ from thes
 ones. Besides people are seeking and taking psychoactive substances from teh very-very beginning. Even animals do. So once again - im not sure if it is a controllable situation. What could have been done: general mental health propaganda and education (and i mean not just about drugs! dealing with stress, relationships, etc. could be much more usefull. There are reasons why people reach for drugs - beside the pleasure. What else... Oh yes. Prozac is a legal drug, as far as i know. I think it has to stay t
at way - it is an effective medicine, not a happy pill.
<LI>Drugs (including alcohol) have become waaaaay to commonplace in our society.
<LI>making drugs freely available will decrease their "glamour" as people sometimes do them just to break the law
<LI>drugs are good
<LI>We should stop this war on smoking and worry about real problems with drugs that are killing this country!!
<LI>the war on drugs is a waste of time, money, and civil rights; this survey has serious problems
<LI>Making them legal will end gang violence.  Everyone is responsible for themselves.
<LI>WRONG
<LI>Education on the the effects on the body should be made available to the individual.\
<LI>Pot should be legal.  Nicotine Illegal.
<LI>I think drugs are o.k if they are not abused. It is alright to use them if they do not become your whole life, and if you don,t "need" them to get by.
<LI>The major problem we are encountering now is not drug abuse bu the drug war itself. People, innocent of drug related crimes or not, are harmed every year by over zealous drug enforcement agents. Drugs are not a victimless crime; they hurt the individual and they hurt society when a frequent user turns to crime to obtain his fix. Te answer to these problems however is not 'three strikes, you're out' policies, but rather the availability of all drugs to their abusers and treatment freely available for th
se same users. Education, which involves the treating of drug abusers as sick people, not criminals, is what is needed.
<LI>I beleive it all boils down to how a person was raised and self esteem issues. If parents would do a better job rasing kids today, then future generations might not see as big of problem with drugs.
<LI>Marijuana is probably the only drug that should be legalized.  I have never seen or heard of anyone who was stoned kill somebody  because of the drug.
<LI>I HATE heroin.  It killed Jonathan Melvoin and destroyed to many peoples lives!  I am young enough to not have tried anything and now I never will.  Remember July 12, 1996 forever...
<LI>As political power shifts generationally, the scapegoating will decrease
<LI>Marijuana should be legalized for medicinal uses only.
<LI>devastating
<LI>a little bit of anything isnt going to cause a problem but a lot af any drug is.
<LI>some drugs in moderation can actually be better for you mentaly and physically than none at all
<LI>Do what you want to do in your own home or where it is legal to partake.
<LI>some drugs should be legalized. moderation is the key. legal drugs should have appropriate dosages on labels. people should attempt to use only recreationally.
<LI>Its more along the lines of personal choice.  Adults seem to know what up, with proper education.
<LI>Drugs have been around for a long time.  It should be up to the individual to decide.
<LI>Lighter drugs (alcohol, marjuana) should be legalized for adults with sanctions only administered *IF* social or civil order is disturbed by its use.
