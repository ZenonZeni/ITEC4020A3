Meetings with scientists<BR>

</B><BR>

A series of meetings was held during the week to discuss joint scientific

programs based on the analysis and applications of ATSR data. More details

on these meetings are available on request. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Albin Zavody</I></B> - Discussed the new SST and cloud-clearing algorithms

for the re-analysis of ATSR data. A paper was under preparation detailing

the new cloud-clearing scheme. Differences between ATSR and ATSR-2 data

products were discussed and methods for investigating these differences

evolved. New data files were obtained to extend the RAL atmospheric transmission

model to wider spectral bands in the near and thermal infrared. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Chris Mutlow</I></B> - Discussed future validation plans including

the possible use of Australian waters for international campaigns. The collaboration

with Iwate University at Mutsu Bay in North Japan had suffered from persistent

cloud cover and some logistic problems. Chris was also taking over from

I Barton as the Chairman of the CEOS IVOS sub-group (see below) and details

of the hand-over were arranged. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Phil Watts</I></B> - Phil is planning to spend some time at DAR in

the near future and possible research programs were investigated. These

must fit in with his responsibilities and research activities at RAL as

well as with the programs at DAR. Fred Prata is the point of contact at

DAR. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Myles Allen </I></B>- Discussions on the applications of altimeter

data in oceanography including techniques for combining ATSR and ALT data.

We also talked about future techniques for the best analysis of ATSR data.

It was agreed that the best techniques were probably those detailed in my

recent paper just submitted to JGR. Copies of this paper were left at RAL.

<BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Ryuzo Yokoyama</I></B> - While I was at RAL Professor Yokoyama was

also visiting so we talked about the Mutsu Bay campaigns as well as the

possibility of Yokoyama attending the series of meetings being set up for

Townsville in April 1997. If he attended these meeting he would try and

bring a high resolution infrared camera to obtain some coincident measurements

with the AIMS radiometer installed on the wave-piercing ferry. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Tim Nightingale</I></B> - Tim has built a new infrared radiometer

for SST validation and had used it at Mutsu Bay. The new radiometer was

inspected and provided some possible modifications to the CSIRO models.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Data requests<BR>

</B><BR>

ATSR-2 data were requested for Fred Prata to cover two volcanic eruptions

as well as the data for the DC-8 campaign over the Hay and Amburla test

sites. <BR>

<BR>

A request was lodged for full mission Australian continental coverage for

ATSR-1 data. This request would be forwarded to NERC and we are waiting

for a response. It is likely that this request will be filled when ESA and

RAL start their full ATSR reprocessing program. <BR>

<BR>

RAL also agreed to forward some ABT files as soon as they were available.

These files are required to enable continuation of the ATSR water vapour

derivation studies. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Other contacts<BR>

<BR>

<I>David Llewellyn-Jones (Leicester Uni)</I></B> - Phone discussions regarding

plans for AATSR meetings in Townsville during April 1997. A draft notice

was formulated and has been circulated to likely attendees. The notice is

included as Attachment 1. <BR>

<BR>

<B><I>Cathy Johnson (UK DoE)</I></B> - Cathy is replacing Peter Mallaburn

as the DoE person in charge of the AATSR program. A courtesy phone call

was made to introduce myself and to discuss the status of the AATSR Science

Agreement between CSIRO and DoE. Changes are required to the document since

the demise of the ASO and these would be finalised at the Townsville meeting

in April. <BR>

<B>CEOS WGCV IVOS meeting<BR>

</B><BR>

The two day meeting was chaired by Ian Barton. The minutes of this meeting

are included as attachment 2. Twelfth CEOS WGCV meeting <BR>

<BR>

This meeting was attended as the Australian representative on this Working

Group. The minutes of this meeting will be available in due course. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Significant Items<BR>

</B><BR>

Two significant actions were discussed at the CEOS meetings involving the

intercomparison of data from different satellite instruments using a particular

ground test site. These activities could extend to other test sites in the

future. <BR>

<BR>

The Libyan Desert was selected as the land-based test site and Chris Mutlow

at RAL was to coordinate the collection of data over this site for a selected

time period. The results of this activity would be discussed at the next

IVOS meeting. <BR>

<BR>

Ian Barton suggested the Townsville wave-piercing ferry transect as an ocean

based test site. This has now (Jan. 1997) been agreed with William Skirving

at AIMS and Chris Mutlow at RAL. A fixed time period would be selected to

collect data over this site - probably in mid-1997 to provide cloud-free

conditions and time to ensure that the collection of good ground-truth data

was possible. <BR>

DRAFT PLAN FOR TOWNSVILLE MEETINGS - APRIL 1997 <BR>

</B><BR>

Dear All<BR>

<BR>

Herewith is a draft plan for meetings in Townsville next April. Can you

please let me know if you can make these meetings and whether there are

others who should be invited (David, Should you pass this on to all the

AATSR SAG, - especially the ESA members?). William Skirving has agreed to

look after some of the local arrangements and we will advise of hotels and

meeting places when we have an idea of the number of participants. <BR>

<BR>

I hope you can all make it! Regards, Ian. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Draft Plan for AATSR-Related Meetings in Townsville - April 1997 <BR>

</B><BR>

Below is a list of possible attendees at a series of meetings to be held

in Townsville during the week of 7 - 11 April 1997. Any comments on the

proposed meetings, the list of attendees and the times allowed will be most

welcome. <BR>

<BR>

The meeting schedule will allow for travel to Townsville on Monday afternoon

to give a full day for meetings on the first 2 days. The best ATSR-2 pass

is on Thursday 10 April (Sunday 13 is better - but too late) so we will

all participate in a validation exercise on that day. Please let me know

if you will be able to bring a radiometer on the Field Excursion to the

Barrier Reef. <BR>

<BR>

Please let me know if you are likely to attend these meetings and whether

there are others in your institute that may attend. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Welcome<BR>

</B><BR>

On behalf of DLR and DARA Wolfgang Noack welcomed the participants in the

IVOS meeting and explained the logistics of the meeting and associated activities.

<BR>

<BR>

Introductions went round the room and the Chairman passed on regrets and

apologies from Karl Staenz, Allan Hollinger, Wayne Boncyk (who was represented

by Dennis Helder), Masanobu Shimada and Zhimin Zhang. <BR>

<BR>

The Chairman noted that it was unfortunate that no one from NASA was attending

as the dossier is a key component in IVOS plans and activities. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Objectives/Agenda<BR>

</B><BR>

The Chairman outlined the agenda items and suggested that an important component

of the day's activities was to ensure that the Dossier compilation and maintenance

was progressing well. The second day's sessions would include presentations

from the National Physics Lab. in the UK and a special session on the validation

of future satellite instruments. <BR>

<BR>

The agenda was accepted without modification. <BR>

<BR>

The Chairman informed the meeting that he was standing down as Chair and

that Chris Mutlow had accepted the offer to become the new Chair. The Chairman

thanked all the IVOS participants for their contributions over the past

five years and seven meetings and wished Chris all the best in his new role.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Review of Minutes from Previous Meeting <BR>

</B><BR>

The Chairman reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. He noted that

the two recommendations presented to the plenary were accepted with modification

and some discussion. The recommendation that ``satellite operators provide

reliable on-board calibration'' was discussed and Plenary asked for the

recommendation to be more specific with a definition of on-board calibration.

For test sites the action is on WGCV members to go back to their agencies

and propose international test sites and to foster the use of the proposed

test sites. <BR>

<BR>

Much discussion about this topic centred on the fact that CEOS doesn't provide

any funds for activities and thus, what kind of recommendations WGCV can

make? Alan Belward noted that if IVOS developed recommendations with greater

specificity then the plenary and sponsoring agencies may be more likely

to accept and support the recommendations. Kumar asked what the criteria

for a CEOS-endorsed test site is? Garth Morgan suggested that the sites

listed in the dossier should be considered CEOS- endorsed, although funding

to maintain the sites (e.g. collection and archiving of ground data, etc)

will have to come from each agency. Mike Rast suggested that the dossier

is compiled for information purposes and that some effort needs to go into

selecting test sites and developing cross-calibration plans, etc.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Review of Action Items<BR>

<BR>

</B><U>IVOS-3-1</U>. Still open - but will be replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-1

with a reminder that all IVOS members should notify the WGCV Secretariat

with information on new campaigns and instruments. Alan Belward says that

when the information is available it should be emailed and hosted on or

linked to the CEOS-WGCV web page. <BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-4-6</U>. Outstanding. Will be replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-6. <BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-1.</U> Closed. The Chairman commented that he welcomed the attendance

of Guiseppe Zibordi and other Ocean Colour folks as this will help with

the co-ordination of their activities. He also suggested that it was unrealistic

for agencies to send more than one or two representatives to IVOS meetings

and it was thus the responsibility of those attending to represent their

agencies interests in a wider range of cal/val activities than their own

special areas of interest.<BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-2</U>. Outstanding. Will be replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-2. At present

there is a limited number of test sites on the Dossier and a special effort

would be made to ensure that this component of the Dossier was expanded.

<BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-3.</U> Outstanding. Replaced by ACTION IVOS-7-2. <BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-4.</U> Closed. <BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-5.</U> Closed. <BR>

<BR>

<U>IVOS-6-6.</U> Closed. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Report from Plenary<BR>

</B><BR>

The new Chairman of WGCV (Alan Belward) briefly reviewed the results of

the plenary meeting. A key item is that the affiliates now have a mandate

for greater participation in CEOS working groups. The plenary wants to know

what the consequences of the recommendations will be on the working groups.

WGCV is encouraged to address cal/val recommendations emanating from the

Sept 96 In-situ Observations for Global Observing Systems, Geneva. These

recommendations were directed towards the end user and geophysical (derived)

data sets, and contained fundamental cal/val issues. Rao stated that we

should stay away from algorithm specifications and focus more on basic sensor

calibration and radiance. Phil Teillet however noted that the funding reality

is that the focus needs to be on end-user product validation. Rao argued

that only operational algorithms should be considered for validation - experimental

algorithms being too unbounded.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Agency/Country Reports<BR>

</B><BR>

Chris Mutlow - RAL, UK. ATSR-2 has been resurrected and has been operational

for some time. ATSR-2 calibration has been confirmed and validated using

several methods including: <BR>

<BR>

on-board calibration <BR>

<BR>

vicarious calibration - desert sites <BR>

<BR>

vicarious calibration - deep convective clouds <BR>

<BR>

GOME comparisons <BR>

<BR>

sunglint <BR>

<BR>

All methods confirmed ATSR-2 pre-flight calibration except 1.6 micron channel

which was off by a factor of 1.4 An error was discovered in the pre-flight

calibration calculations and the following correction results were very

good. Chris discussed the ATSR-2 instrument characterisation. They use an

on-board visible calibration which views the sun each orbit for calibration.

Using both White Sands and the Libyan desert sites has resulted in consistent

results and they have also done some cross-calibration with AVHRR measurements

over the Libyan desert sites with good results. In addition, comparisons

with aircraft underflights have been very good in the IR and good in the

vis/near IR.<BR>

<BR>

<U>Rao - NOAA, USA</U>. The new AVHRR/3 instrument will have a new channel

3a (1.58-1.64 micron) for aerosol products. This will change the basic data

formats which will impact operational processing and calibration. AVHRR/3

will also have a sun shield to limit stray light contamination. Rao reviewed

the AVHRR Libyan desert calibration noting that the values are tied to U2

aircraft underflights which minimise atmospheric contamination. All of this

information is available and kept current on the NOAA web site. Rao is also

looking at test sites in Nevada USA and the Gobi desert. Ross Mitchell from

CSIRO will be looking at desert sites in Australia. <BR>

<BR>

In ensuing discussion it was noted that spatial homogeneity, temporal and

seasonal consistency, consistent elevation, access to the site for ground-based

collaborative measurements and no BRDF contamination are important for any

vicarious calibration test site. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Phil Teillet - CCRS and IGBP</U>. The Canadian report had been submitted

in hardcopy. Phil did discuss one urgent topical issue. He noted that some

BOREAS sites may be maintained for 3 years and will be available to cal/val

activities, however others are being closed. A final decision will be made

in December and IVOS members should immediately notify Phil of any interest

in these sites. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Guiseppe Zibordi - EU</U>. Guiseppe discussed the CoASTS project - Coastal

Atmosphere and Sea Time Series project. This involved the collection of

measurements over the north Adriatic Sea to support SeaWiFS and OCTS. This

has also involved evaluating bio-fouling of underwater radiometers as well

as intercomparison of atmospheric and marine radiometers. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Oaku - NASDA, Japan</U>. ADEOS cal/val briefing. Much work is being done

on detector normalisation and characterisation. For OCTS, the on-board calibration

is being used for trend analysis only at this time; users will need to use

pre-launch information until vicarious and buoy data are available. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Mike Rast - ESA</U>. ERS; GOME cal/val is nominally complete though more

work is being done now that algorithms are changing. ENVISAT; MERIS calibration

work ongoing; they have had two additional diffuser plates developed and

will be shipped to GSFC for comparison. MERIS is also looking into options

for vicarious calibration test sites. Mike noted that a recent issue of

Remote Sensing of the Environment includes a paper of desert test sites

for optical satellites and Mike circulated a good reference book (by Kramer).

Ian noted that these should be added to the proposed CEOS WGCV bibliography.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Action:</B> Mike to circulate the study on cal/val strategies to the

IVOS group pending review of the study. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Lasse Pettersson - Norway</U>. Lasse described ALOMAR; a lidar facility

at 69N which collects year round ground-based atmospheric parameters to

study the arctic atmosphere including thermal and chemical parameters for

trend measurements. ALOMAR is collecting a long-term baseline data set as

well as campaign-specific measurements. An ALOMAR and GOME calibration exercise

is underway. They would like to use OCTS data in this work since SEAWIFS

will not be available for some time. <BR>

<BR>

<U>Dennis Helder - SDSU / EROS Data Center</U>. EROS are characterising

TM through the internal calibrator. They are looking within an orbit, in

a 30 day outgassing cycle, and through the instrument life. They have also

looked at several night scenes to identify and correct the ``memory effect''

of the calibration pulse (memory effect being up to 2 DN). EROS is also

looking at pulse decay effects. Lifetime degradation of the calibration

lamps is being investigated. Landsat 5 has lost forward scan calibration

pulses. LSAT 7 is similar to LSAT 4-5 and is scheduled for May 98 launch.

The Enhanced (?) Thematic Mapper (ETM) has a 5 % absolute radiometric accuracy

which should be double earlier TM sensors. ETM will collect sun view data

once per day and will have a full solar calibration once a month. LSAT7

processing will correct for affects identified in the earlier satellites.

A Landsat TM Radiometry page has been prototyped at <BR>

http://iplab2out.sdstate.edu/tmcal <BR>

<BR>

<U>Stephen Tjemkes - Eumetsat</U> Operational calibration of Meteosat: Currently

here is no onboard calibration performed for Meteosat. Since the blackbody

cannot be used. In future (Meteosat 7) the onboard blackbody calibration

can be utilised, however it is inserted into the optical path with a mirror

such that not the whole optical path can be calibrated. For the calibration

of the VIS channel aircraft observations and model calculations are used.

Since the spectral response function of the VIS channel is rather wide,

the calibration is scene dependent. Therefore, clouds, sea, vegetation and

desert (Tunisia) targets are used for the vicarious calibration. The estimated

error in the aircraft observations are 5 %. The independent calculations

by the Matrix Operator Method also shows 5 % uncertainty. <BR>

<BR>

Analysis of the calibration coefficient of the two infrared channels depicts

minor problems with the current adopted cloud detection method. The calibration

of the IR window channel relates digital counts over clear ocean areas to

radiances calculated using a radiative transfer model with SST analysis,

and ECMWF forecast data. The uncertainty in the calibration coefficient

is estimated to be 1% with a possible 1K bias in the radiance. The WV channel

calibration relates the clear sky area digital counts to radiances calculated

using a radiative transfer model adopting collocated radiosondes. Therefore

in addition to the problems with the cloud detection method, the vicarious

calibration of this channel is also dependent on the quality of the radiosonde

observations. The precision of the current calibration coefficient is about

3% with a possible 5% bias. <BR>

<BR>

Eumetsat is planning satellite intercalibration for all three channels.

For the VIS channel this involves the Meteosat 5, Meteosat 6 and where possible

the AVHRR. For the two infrared channels this involves the HIRS instrument

and AVHRR. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Calibration Test Sites and Dossier Status</B> <BR>

<BR>

Several members noted that information that had been supplied for inclusion

on the WWW was not there. Alan Belward thus suggested that we make a specific

recommendation that specific information which we have submitted be made

available on the web. Ian suggested that 10 or so sites could be identified

for immediate inclusion on the web. These should be vicarious calibration

sites. Validation sites such as Hapex, Sahel and Boreas will be addressed

later. Phil Slater suggested that vicarious calibration sites such as these

be considered level 1 sites, and product validation sites be considered

level 2. <BR>

<BR>

The following sites were identified along with those persons to be responsible

for supplying the test site information to the NASA representative who maintains

the WWW site.<BR>

<B>Action: </B>For these sites, the identified folks will get a copy of

the form off the web, send to J Butler, with a copy to Alan Belward and

the WGCV Secretariat by 1 March. These will be updated on CEOS web site

(by 1 July) and the progress of the dossier site will be monitored. Phil

Slater noted that it's important to advertise campaigns to better utilise

resources. There was some discussion about the applicability of some of

the ocean sites. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Discussion on Future Special Sessions and Activities<BR>

<BR>

An IVOS Data Set<BR>

</B><BR>

The Chairman proposed that IVOS could select 2 sites and a time period and

collect all the data available from all sensors. <BR>

<BR>

Kumar noted that if CEOS takes it up, all data should be provided free.

<BR>

<BR>

The Chairman suggested that we could start collecting data now and India

investigate the possibility of doing the work as part of taking the secretariat

in a year's time. There was then some discussion about data availability.

Alan suggests that we should identify the level of effort it would take

for compiling and analysing the data. All agreed that this should be undertaken.

<BR>

<BR>

<B>Specialist Sessions<BR>

</B><BR>

Rao suggested a special session on on-board calibration systems for the

next meeting. The Airborne RS conference in Copenhagen in July 97 has a

special session/short course on imaging spectrometer calibration and correction.

Phil&nbsp;Teillet suggested that hyperspectral calibration in general should

be considered for a future session. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Phil Teillet's New Paradigm in Cal/Val</B> <BR>

<BR>

Phil started his presentation by stating that users will only use data products

if the calibration was transparent to their application. He then discussed

the spectral and spatial resolution of various instruments. For instrument

calibration there are only a few operational cases. Generally atmospheric

correction is non-operational, but requires well calibrated data and timely,

ready access to atmospheric parameters. In the past little attention has

been paid to spectral characterisation but this is required to generate

geophysical parameters from different instruments. Phil also discussed geometric

effects, viewing directions, topography, scan angle, resampling, etc. These

all have a big effect on information content. <BR>

<BR>

Users: Special users do their own preprocessing and require high accuracy.

Operational users need good cal/val for further work, but don't want to

know abut cal/val. The majority of users need stability and quality but

don't really know about cal/val. Existing algorithms do not meet the needs

of operational users. To get to the majority of users it is necessary to

be clear about what is being offered. For Remote Sensing, one needs reliability

of supply, plug and play, and data quality (consistency, quantitative and

comparable). <BR>

<BR>

A future strategy should take account of research, reference sites, demonstration,

QA focus, standardisation, accreditation and communication. Phil also suggested

that we think laterally; e.g., recommend that all future instruments include

specific common channels. Ground truth areas of 10KM x 10KM area are needed

to compensate for current problems in calibration. Data should be hyperspectral,

measured from a low altitude aircraft. Phil also introduced the Quantitative

Stability Reference (QUASAR) Concept in which hyperspectral data ($10-$15K

per flight) are collected. This would be followed by radiometric, spectral

and geometric processing of the data. Phil hopes to begin some flights in

97 and expand his activities in 98. He would then generate products (surface

reflectance and at-sensor radiance, and NDVI and biophysical) and distribute

site statistics on a CCRS web site one week post-flight. The results would

also be available as wall-to-wall data sets on CD-ROM one month post-flight.

<BR>

<BR>

For this activity the site considerations are; uniformity, flatness, and

size (10x10km). Primary sites would be in prairie grasslands in Canada and

Nevada. <BR>

<BR>

With this New Paradigm the immediate action should be on the communication

aspects. In particular web sites and the dossier should be improved and

kept current.<BR>

<BR>

Important questions to be considered are: error budget, site selection,

spatial resolution, imaging calibration, etc. Infrastructure questions are:

availability of instrument, turn-around time, who participates. Phil then

showed several images to illustrate potential sites and highlighted subtle

differences in and among sites. <BR>

<BR>

Discussion: Phil Slater endorsed this new idea as he believes the funding

for on-board calibration will soon be drying up. <BR>

<BR>

Chris Mutlow noted that many instrument characteristics will not be identifiable

without on-board calibration. Specifically, build up of condensation during

outgassing cycles can't be observed by campaigns.<BR>

<BR>

Phil Slater then asked about a joint field campaign in Nevada and several

expressed interest in participating including UK/RAL, CCRS, NASDA, and possibly

NOAA. A meeting to discuss this would be held in February next. <BR>

<BR>

<B>3rd December 1996<BR>

<BR>

Country/Agency Reports (contd<BR>

<BR>

</B><U>China</U>. The Chairman read the highlights of the China country

report which was submitted by Zhimin Zhang who was unable to attend due

to problems with getting a Visa. The full report would be placed on the

WGCV site on the WWW. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Presentations by NPL, UK<BR>

<BR>

<I>David Robinson and Nigel Fox - UK National Standards Laboratory. <BR>

</I></B><BR>

David Robinson gave an introduction to NPL - it is the UK's NMI (National

Measurement Institute - any country's official measurements institute).

NPL has about 600 scientists, more than 95 years in operation and maintains

all 7 SI units (Kg Mt Sec K Amp Candela Mole). NMIs establish international

equivalence of standards as well as R &amp;D contracting and technology

transfer. <BR>

<BR>

Scope of NPL's space measurement activities: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Optical thermal instruments, <BR>

<BR>

RF/microwave/millimetre wave, <BR>

<BR>

time and frequency, <BR>

<BR>

problem solving and other measurement services. <BR>

<BR>

Importance of space standards; continuity, traceability, and terrestrial

equivalence. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

Nigel Fox started his presentation by discussing Accuracy vs Precision;

accuracy is how well a measurement is known compared to an internationally

agreed standard or scale while precision is how well a measurement can be

repeated. Accuracy is less than precision but accuracy enables different

instrument measurements to be compared, allows long term validity of data

sets, and enables compatibility with other terrestrial data (e.g. ground-

based radiometers equivalent to space-based, and finally reduces room for

argument. E.g. fibre optic power showing that calibration efforts have resulted

in much higher accuracy. Nigel explained the standards verification and

traceability process and how the measurements are filtered out to the user

community. <BR>

<BR>

Limitations to accuracy are that the NSL does not understand user-specific

requirements,, and space scientist don't understand options available from

NSL and of course time and budgets are always limited. The various assumptions

made in the interpretation of optical measurements from space using pre-flight

and in-flight calibration (TIR black body, VIS/NIR Lamp &amp; Diffuser)

were listed. Solar calibration and vicarious methods were then discussed.

Steps to obtaining a calibration baseline from a National Standards Lab

and the sources of error in this calibration information from irradiance

scales, BRDF, etc were then described. NPL have developed a new technique

to reduce errors and improve dissemination of calibration to the community.

This involved reducing uncertainty using a new radiance standard (using

a new cryogenic radiometer) and reducing the length of the calibration chain.

Nigel provided details on current calibration methods in use. <BR>

<BR>

Direct radiance measurements using filter radiometers for both VIS/NIR and

TIR have been shown to reduce measurement errors. These transfer radiometers

are portable, robust, vacuum compatible, quick and cheap, and highly accurate.

One drawback is that the number of channels available can be limited. This

was followed by a discussion of accuracy of field calibration and options

for field calibration. <BR>

<BR>

Discussion: Availability; the portable calibration standard for visible

is available now, depending on the specific channels requested. NRL can

also calibrate participant's own radiometers as needed. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Action: </B>Nigel and David to forward a list of relevant references

and the Chairman encouraged them to publish details of their new technique

in a scientific journal. <BR>

<BR>

Phil Slater(EOS Calibration Scientist) is also planning to form an EOS Calibration

Panel sub-group to co-ordinate and oversee all EOS-related vicarious calibration

activities. <BR>

<BR>

The Chairman thanked both David and Nigel for their presentations and was

sure that the new technique would soon be adopted by those using transfer

standards to assess the performance of space instruments. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Special Session on Future Validation Plans<BR>

<BR>

Phil Slater - MODIS calibration <BR>

</B><BR>

Phil gave details of the plans in place for EOS instrument cal/val. In particular

he discussed the calibration of the short-wave channels of the MODIS instrument.

Two techniques will be used - reflectance-based calibration and radiance-based

calibration. He described the errors involved in the calibration procedures

and detailed the traceability of the measurements using transfer standards.

A list of proposed intensive field campaigns was given along with plans

for pre-launch cal/val activities using ground-based test sites in the western

US. Hard copies of the presentation &quot;Validation of MODIS-derived top-of-atmosphere

spectral radiances by means of vicarious calibration&quot; were made available

at the meeting.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Mike Rast - MERIS Cal/Val Activities <BR>

</B><BR>

Mike reviewed the 15-band MERIS instrument characteristics, the System Performance

Parameters, and the operational characteristics. The MERIS Cal/Val Requirements

Report and plan is now complete. This includes calibration requirements,

validation of atmospheric correction requirements and the validation of

water constituents algorithms. Mike reviewed the following MERIS plans prior

to launch. <BR>

<BR>

1997 Identify and select vicarious calibration test sites, detailed plan

for VC, prepare airborne campaign, prepare data sets from MOS/OCTS/ in-situ,

and simulation studies for Case 1 and 2 waters. <BR>

<BR>

1998 analysis of variability of optical properties and aircraft campaign

for case 2 waters, cloud, vegetation, and VC sites.<BR>

<BR>

1999 evaluate campaign results and fine-tune calibration algorithms. <BR>

<BR>

Major questions for the IVOS groups to consider: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Where do we stand with respect to the design/definition of

a coordinated cal/val strategy for large scale optical sensors? <BR>

<BR>

2. What is the most commonly atmospheric transfer procedure used and what

could be the means of translating different correction procedures (between

different sensor data sets and consequently make products from different

sensors compatible? <BR>

<BR>

3. What Solar Irradiance profile shall we use? There are currently different

values being used in the community. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

Chris asked if the atmospheric correction issue can't be addressed by the

International Radiation Commission? Rao says not, due in part to the proliferation

of available RT programs. The key seems to be that investigators should

clearly document what RT code was used and, and importantly, what input

parameters (spectra etc) are used. <BR>

<BR>

Mike also presented information from the Atmospheric Chemistry Validation

Team (ACTV) (E. Attema). They have been working with GOME, MIPAS, GOMOS

and Sciamachy. They currently have actions to compile an inventory of validation

methods, select a data centre and informatics infrastructure, and to identify

likely participants. Plans include: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Feb 97 identification of ACTV members <BR>

<BR>

Summer 97 plenary ACTV meeting <BR>

<BR>

Summer 98 rehearsal campaign <BR>

<BR>

Autumn 99 Envisat commissioning</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

Chris Mutlow noted that MERIS/ATSR-2 and AATSR should be included as significant

parts of the cal/val plans.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Giancarlo Maracci - Vegetation Programme<BR>

</B><BR>

Giancarlo presented an overview of the VEGETATION instrument characteristics

including a brief description of the on-board calibration for the vegetation

monitor. Additional general information is available at http://www-vegetation.cst.cnes.fr:8050/.

A launch is scheduled for the second half of 1998. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Chris Mutlow - AATSR validation <BR>

</B><BR>

AATSR will be tied to the same calibration sources as the earlier instruments

(ATSR and ATSR-2). The AATSR would be going into the Thermal-Vacuum test

chamber soon. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Strategy for Cal/Val of Large Scale Optical Sensors</B> <BR>

<BR>

The chairman suggested that one option to follow would be the method of

IOCCG as the inclusion of this activity in IVOS may be too big a task to

handle efficiently. Alan Belward stated that this should stay in IVOS because

the people who are key to this coordination should be involved in IVOS.

Chris Mutlow indicated that the list of attendees may be slightly different,

but the work could take place in conjunction with IVOS. Several people agreed

that a good first step would be to work on an intercomparison and a coordinated

calibration effort over a selected site and the Egyptian (Libyan) desert

appeared to be a good candidate. Participants would be asked to bring data

samples and actually work through the intercomparison during the next IVOS

meeting; this may preempt work on an IVOS data set. <BR>

<BR>

It was also noted that two geostationary satellites cover the Libyan Desert

Test Site. Chris will identify people who need to be contacted in order

to select a time period, and set up the task. The assumption is that the

site will be the Libyan Desert (21-23N and 28-29E) and TOA radiances will

be investigated. Guiseppe Zibordi offered to gather a coincident MOS, OCTS,

and in-situ data for a coordinated validation effort. Mike Rast noted that

this exercise (pilot project) should be viewed as a first step in developing

a coordinated cal/val strategy. In addition, the information about RT procedures

should be spelled out clearly and used in the intercalibration exercise

in order to better identify the specific information which should be requested

in the future. Klaus-Dieter Rockwitz noted that an atmospheric instrument

group (in ESA) could be asked to develop a strategic plan for calibration

and validation and report provide this as input to IVOS.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Strategic Plan<BR>

</B><BR>

IVOS plans: these should be updated before the next meeting. Alan noted

that some other mechanism may be used for the ``living document'' which

describes the WGCV activities. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Recommendations to WGCV<BR>

</B><BR>

Recommendations will be held over until the next subgroup meeting as this

will take place before the next plenary. <BR>

<B>Next Meeting<BR>

</B><BR>

The Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics has offered to host the next

WGCV meeting in China. IVOS members unanimously expressed the wish to hold

the next IVOS meeting during the two days preceding this meeting. There

were two time constraints that should be considered in setting these dates.

<BLOCKQUOTE>1. The IGARSS meeting - Aug 4-8 in Singapore.<BR>

<BR>

2. NOAA-K will be launched in mid-August which may impact the NASA and NOAA

folks' ability to participate. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>

The new IVOS Chair would circulate the dates and details of the next meeting

as soon as they were available. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Close<BR>

</B><BR>

The chairman thanked DLR and DARA for co-hosting the meeting and thought

that it had been a good meeting. He was hopeful that by the next meeting

there would be a substantial increase in the information on test sites that

was available on the WWW and that the Libyan Desert exercise would be a

start in developing closer collaboration between space agencies in cal/val

activities. The meeting closed at 5 pm. <BR>
