Formulation of
Flexible Firestops

A flexible, fire retardant material intended for use as firestops
in deterring the spread of fire, smoke and fumes during fires in
buildings has been formulated by researchers at 3M (St. Paul, MN
55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110).  Walton W. Welna reports that the
product includes an intumescent material, a stabilizing agent and
an elastomeric organic binder throughout which the intumescent
material and stabilizing agent are dispersed.

Fire, smoke and fumes in confined spaces, such as multifloor
buildings, can be life threatening.  Frequently fire originating in
the space between a floor and ceiling of such a structure will
spread, along with the resultant smoke and fumes, to other open
spaces in the building, especially to open spaces above the point
of origin of the fire.  The spaces between conduits and piping and
the floors and ceilings through which they pass, or through
penetrations, must be protected by fire resistant materials.  A
through penetration offers an area of low resistance to fire, smoke
and fumes and may serve as a chimney for heat, flame and fumes.
Through penetrations may be filled with commercially available fire
retardant and intumescent putties, caulks, wraps, sheets or mats,
or firestops.

Many commercially available firestop products can reduce or
eliminate the chimney effect for through penetrations and pass the
rigorous ASTM E-814 fire endurance test.  After intumescing and
charring, the material is not easily blown out of penetrations when
subjected to water hose pressure typical of fire fighting
conditions.  Essential characteristics of a firestop material
include the ability to expand and to char, and the charred material
must have enough strength to withstand the test conditions.
Although adequate firestops exist, the goal of 3M researchers was
to formulate a product which retains its expansion, low compression
set, and flexibility after long-term exposure to oxidative
environments.

3M says that the new firestops are an improvement over existing
products because they have superior aging properties, i.e., they
are more resistant to degradation due to ozone and/or oxygen.  They
also have low compression set in the unexpanded state, and superior
char strength in the expanded state.  Finally, the firestops use
ingredients which are believed to be less toxic than those in
conventional compositions.

The intumescent material in the 3M product is a granular hydrated
alkali metal silicate with an average particle size of 0.2-2.0
millimeters (mm).  About 95% by weight of the particles are greater
than 0.2 mm in size.  The alkali metal silicates which work best
are granulated sodium silicates with a moisture content of 5-30% by
weight and a silicon dioxide (SiO2) to sodium oxide (Na2O) ratio in
the 2.0:1.0 to about 3.75:1.0 range.  The elastomeric binder is at
least partially crosslinked, and the stabilizing agent has a
melting point of 105-125(C.  Enough of the stabilizing agent must
be used to keep the composite expansion and compression set
properties stable, even after prolonged exposure to oxidative
conditions.  The 3M product is described in U.S. Patent 5,476,891.

Additives Can Further
Improve Properties

It may be possible to find effective intumescent flame retardant
additives to further reduce the ignitability, heat release rate and
smoke generation of even the best flame retardant plastics,
composites, adhesives, and fabrics, says a scientist at Polytechnic
University (Six Metrotech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201; Tel: 718/260-
3715).  Edward D. Weil reports that in some cases there are
empirical guidelines, and in other cases theory points our
promising directions.

Shifting the degradation pathway away from volatile fuel release to
crosslinking and/or the generation of vapors with low fuel values
may represent the likely basis for the highly effective phosphorus-
based flame retardant systems in cellulose.  The degradation is
shifted from volatile levoglucosan to the formation of crosslinked
char.  Enhanced water release is undoubtedly another important
factor.  A quantitative study of the thermal effects of flame
retarding cellulose by alkali showed that the reduction of the fuel
content of the volatiles counteracted the enhanced rate of
degradation and enhanced volatile generation.

Crosslinking, char enhancement and water release are probably the
main modes of action of phosphorus flame retardants in certain
other systems, i.e., in rigid urethane systems, reports Weil.
Phosphorus flame retardants have several other distinct modes of
action, including endothermic, radical scavenging and coating
effects.

Work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
has provided quantum chemical support for the concept that
crosslinking should help flame retardancy.  The initial formation
of thermally stable crosslinks begins the process of char formation
and retards the formation of volatile fuels.  For instance, the
dechloranes, together with certain metal oxides, are high
temperature vulcanizing agents for polyolefin elastomers.  When
they are used as flame retardants, the result is greatly increased
char yield.

This concept also works with a fairly wide range of thermoplastics
where there is a functional group that can be exploited for
purposes of crosslinking.  Acid catalysts flame retard polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA), apparently by causing anhydride links to form.
In some cases, they cause crosslinks to form.

Various other polymer-specific catalytic systems have been found.
One is the action of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) as a catalyst for the
trimerization of the nitrile group in styrene-acrylonitrile
copolymers, with resultant char enhancement.  Sulfonate salt flame
retardants, which work at very low levels in polycarbonates, are
catalysts for the formation of an intumescent char, although
increased carbon dioxide (CO2) evolution may also have an effect.

Another polymer-specific additive that is almost surely catalytic
is platinum used at low levels in peroxide-cured silica-filled
silicone rubbers.  The details of the catalytic effect of platinum
are not clear, although it may somehow inhibit depolymerizaton of
the siloxane structure.  This is one of the most effective flame
retardants known, and it has a detectable effect at parts per
million (ppm) levels.  It provides reason to hope that other such
highly efficient catalyst systems may be found.

Dow Corning's New
Resin Modifiers

A new family of resin modifiers in solid silicone powder form is
being marketed by Dow Corning Corp. (Midland, MI 48686).  Marketed
under the somewhat confusing name "Si Powder Resin Modifiers," the
product is a free flowing, 100% active silicone powder intended to
enhance the physical properties of highly filled flame retardant
thermoplastics, modify thermoplastic burning characteristics, and
improve processing efficiency.

Dow Corning developed the additives to meet the needs of
compounders and injection molders, who want the benefits of a
silicone additive.  The second goal was to improve some of the fire
performance characteristics of plastics without negatively
affecting processing and molding properties.  The Dow Corning
contact is Thomas Vassallo (Tel: 517/496-6289), Additives Industry
Manager.

Si Powder additives are believed to be compatible with halogenated,
halogen-free and phosphorus-based flame retardant additives in a
wide variety of thermoplastic powders.  They are easy to compound
and can be premixed with thermoplastic pellets or powders.  The
additives significantly reduce the rate of heat release and the
evolution of smoke and carbon monoxide of burning plastics such as
polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene and polycarbonate.

Loading levels of 0.1-1.0% permit the resin modifiers to reduce
extruder torque and power consumption and improve the surface gloss
of the final product, but loadings of 1.0-8.0% are required to
modify the burning characteristics of thermoplastics.

Loadings of 3.0-5.0% can restore the impact resistance that flame
retardant additives tend to produce, and levels in the 15% range
may actually improve impact strength.  Such loadings can also
reduce the required loadings of the primary flame retardant
additives.  The new modifiers are available in several grades with
different organic reactivity.

The type of organic reactivity determines compatibility and
performance in particular applications.  The powders are available
in 5-pound samples, 100-pound fiber packs or in bulk.  Dow Corning
is testing Si Powder additives for use in polyolefins, styrenics,
vinyl resins, engineering thermoplastics, and thermoplastic
elastomers.

Phosphorus-Based
Masterbatches Debut

Albright & Wilson Americas (Box 26229, Richmond, VA 23260) has
introduced its trademarked Amgard CPC 400 Series of red phosphorus-
based flame retardant masterbatches.  Mark Huggard says that the
Amgard CPC 400 products include 50% red phosphorus in various
carriers.  The nonhalogenated products do not require synergists to
achieve maximum flame retardant performance.  All of the new
products are solid pellets and are intended for use in nylon 6,
nylon 6,6, polyamide and glass-filled polyamide resins.  End use
applications include wire and cable jacketing, extruded products,
and injection molding resins.

Advantages of the Amgard CPC 400 products include minimum loss of
physical properties in compounded products, excellent thermal
stability and chemical inertness.  They facilitate nonblooming in
final products and have minimal impact on the electrical properties
of base polymers.

Composite Walls
Keep Prisons Secure

A composite security wall system with high impact performance and
compliant with certain fire codes has been built by engineers at GE
Plastics (One Plastics Ave., Pittsfield, MA 01201; 800/845-0600 or
413/448-7110).  Bruce M. Torrey reports that the security wall can
be employed in wall systems in institutions such as minimum
security prisons, detention areas, hospitals, asylums and
psychiatric facilities.

The GE composite, more fully described in U.S. Patent 5,477,652,
includes a thermoplastic polycarbonate sheet and a gypsum board dry
wall product laminated together with an adhesive.  The easy to
install composite is then fastened to wall studs with the
thermoplastic sheet on the inside, i.e., in contact with the wall
studs.

Providing the building and construction industry with an easy to
install, high impact and penetration resistant security wall system
has proven difficult.  Current designs call for the installation of
metal mesh with gypsum board or concrete or masonry wall products,
which are heavy and costly to install.  Other gypsum type products
that are double walled would add considerably to overall
construction costs.  Since such security wall products require
double installation or expensive masonry or concrete products, a
single composite security wall system would significantly reduce
overall costs by being easy to install.

One product on the market today that has been successfully used in
security wall systems is a material with a gypsum core and
densified gypsum outer layers.  While this product provides higher
impact than standard gypsum, it must be double walled to provide
enough security for institutional use.  Its impact resistance, 100
foot pounds (ft. lbs.) or less, is not sufficient to meet the
requirements of many applications.

Other systems that have been used to provide impact performance and
to meet building code requirements for fire resistance consist of
masonry products or several (more than two) layers of gypsum board.
Still other approaches call for the use of metal mesh welded to
metal studs with gypsum board fastened over the metal mesh.  The
gypsum board in this system would actually be fastened to the metal
wall studs.

The polycarbonate sheet used in the GE system is normally about
0.080 inch thick and does not exceed 0.125 inch.  Such a system can
withstand an impact of well in excess of 650 ft. lbs. on the dry
wall side.  In fact, the impact could not actually be measured,
since the metal studs collapsed without the composite cracking or
breaking.  Other materials tested for impact failed at 100-200 ft.
lbs. of impact.

In addition to impact resistance, the composite also meets the
requirement of the National Fire Protection Assn. (NFPA) Life
Safety Code 101 as "Limited Combustible" under NFPA Standard 295.
This standard also requires the product to meet strict flame spread
(ASTM E84) and BTU per lb. limits not exceeding 3500 BTU per lb. of
sample, as outlined in NFPA Standard 259.  A test sample of the new
composite that included a 0.81 inch thick polycarbonate sheet,
contact adhesive and gypsum wallboard 0.75 inch thick, when
subjected to the NFPA 259 and NFPA 101 Limited Combustibles tests,
had a total BTU content of 1746 BTU's per lb. of content.

Foam Fills Holes in
Structural Components

Engineers at BASF Corp. (3000 Continental Dr., Mt. Olive, NJ 07828-
1234; Tel: 201/426-2600) have formulated flame retardant rigid
polyurethane/polyisocyanurate foams containing paraffinic based
oils intended for use in filling water-containing cavities in
structural components.  Agus Sampara reports that BASF formulated
a rigid polyurethane foam to which a base stock lubricating oil
made of at least 55% by weight of paraffinic carbons and less than
10% by weight aromatic carbons was added.

The hydrophobic agent protects the polyurethane foam from reacting
with environmental moisture.  The foam is intended for deposit in
railroad spike holes or any structural member with a cavity in
which moisture would otherwise react with the isocyanate to produce
an uncontrollable foaming mass.

Considerable attention is being directed toward repairing rather
than replacing structural components, such as railroad ties, as a
more efficient and cost effective means for extending the use of
the whole structure.  When a section of rail must be replaced, or
during routine railroad maintenance, the rail is detached from the
ties by removing the spikes and tie plates, leaving behind railroad
ties having spike holes.  Before these railroad ties can be reused,
the spike holes must be plugged to provide the tie with structural
integrity and prevent water from accumulating within the hole and
rotting the wood.

Various methods to plug spike holes have been proposed, including
driving wooden dowels or metal inserts through the hole.  These
methods  are labor intensive and often leave gaps between the
insert and tie through. The gaps can be a place for water to
accumulate.

An alternative approach is to plug the spike holes with a high
density rigid polyurethane foam.  The problem is that environmental
water or moisture in the holes causes the injected polyurethane
composition to foam uncontrollably, resulting in an undesirable low
density foamed mass with low strength.  A proposed solution is a
hydrophobic urethane employing a coal tar or a coal tar pitch
additive.

The coal tar repels environmental water present and prevents water
from reacting with the foam ingredients.  Unfortunately, coal tar
pitch is predominately composed of polynuclear aromatic compounds
including volatile components carcinogenic to humans such as
anthracene, phenanthrene, and acridine.  Coal tar is also a known
carcinogen and contains numerous aromatic volatiles toxic by
inhalation.

Consequently, the BASF engineers set out to find an alternative to
coal tar based rigid polyurethane foam products which would prevent
the urethane composition from reacting with environmental water or
moisture, while reducing the carcinogenic health risks associated
with the aromatic compounds in coal tar.

The BASF rigid polyurethane/polyisocyanurate is produced by
reacting an organic polyisocyanate with a polyol compound having at
least two isocyanate reaction hydrogens, a lubricating oil with a
base stock having at least 55% by weight carbon atoms in paraffinic
form and no more than 10% by weight carbon atoms in aromatic form,
a foaming agent and a urethane promoting catalyst.  Crosslinkers,
surfactants, emulsifiers and/or a trimerization catalyst to promote
the formation of the isocyanurate structure may also be used.  The
paraffinic based oil is a mixture of paraffinic and naphthenic
hydrocarbons and contains only trace amounts of aromatic
hydrocarbons.

Among the flame retardants which may be used are pentabromodiphenyl
oxide, dibromopropanol, tris(b-chloropropyl)phosphate, 2,2-bis(-
bromoethyl) 1,3-propanediol, tetrakis(2-chloroethyl) ethyl
diphosphate, bis-(2-chloroethyl) 2-chloroethylphosphonate,
molybdenum trioxide, ammonium molybdate, ammonium phosphate,
pentabromodiphenyl oxide, tricresylphosphate,
hexabromocyclododecane and dibromoethyl dibromocyclohexane.  These
flame retardant additives are used in concentrations of 1-25 parts
per 100 parts of polyol mixture.  U.S. Patent 5,476,681 protects
the BASF product.

New Product for
Cable Insulation

A nonhalogenated flame retardant insulation with high oxygen index
has been prepared by researchers at Champlain Cable Corp. (Hercules
Dr., Colchester, VT 05446; Tel: 802/655-2121, Fax: 802/655-2025).
Howard F. McRae reports that the new product features a synergistic
combination of chemistry and irradiation for fabricating wire and
cable insulation and heat shrinkable tubing.  Other advantages are
believed to include improved tensile strength and elongation.

Superior insulating construction materials such as tiles and wall
boards can be produced by a polycondensation process in which
carboxyl groups of an olefinic base are linked with the silanol
groups of a silicone material.  The silanol groups are linked with
hydroxyl groups contained in a hydrated fire retardant filler to
provide an insulation that tolerates high loadings of the flame
retardant.  Although crosslinking in these formulations allow the
inclusion of large amounts of fire retardant filler materials in
the insulation, they cannot be processed into wire insulation of
commercial quality.

One of the drawbacks is that they cannot be easily extruded.
Another difficulty is their characteristically substandard tensile
strength, elongation and flexibility.  The increased crosslinking
of these formulations, while improving the fire retardancy through
higher flame retardant loadings, binds the polymer chains to the
extent that flexibility and elongation are impaired.  Such
overbinding, while useful in tiles and wall construction materials
which are not commercially affected by the reduced flexibility and
elongation, hinders performance in wire and cable insulation.

The Champlain Cable product reflects the discovery that commercial
grade insulation for wire and cable, particularly plenum wire and
cable and heat shrinkable tubing, can be fabricated by reducing the
crosslinking of the components of the polycondensation process.
Conventional insulation chemistry utilizes olefinic base materials
containing 6% carboxyl groups by weight, too high a percentage for
fabricating commercial grades of wire insulation.  Champlain
reduced the range of carboxyl groups to about 1% by weight of the
base material.

Champlain subjected the new formulations to electron beam
irradiation to improve the tensile strength, and to allow generally
higher loadings of the flame retardant additive.  Normally, when
greater amounts of filler materials are employed, the tensile
strength and elongation decrease.  Irradiation often improves
tensile strength, but had never been found to increase the
elongation.

It was shown that without the silanol groupings, the resultant
formulation does not demonstrate an increase in elongation after
irradiation. On the other hand, there is a synergy between the
chemistry of the Champlain product and the irradiation, in which
the combination of the two processes provides an increase in both
tensile strength, to 1,000-2,000 psi, and elongation, to 370-450%.

The hydroxyl-containing fire retardant filler used in the
insulation is normally magnesium hydroxide, but alumina trihydrate
may also be employed.  The formulation, which permits flame
retardant additive loadings three times as high as those in
conventional insulation, has greatly improved flame retardancy.
Oxygen indices of 42-72 have been achieved.  U.S. Patent RE35127,
a reissue of U.S. Patent 5,063,266, details the new Champlain Cable
work.

Ceramic Composite
Shaped for Furnaces

A new shaped ceramic composite material produced at 3M (St. Paul,
MN 55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110) is intended for use in
applications requiring good heat resistance and mechanical
properties, such as gas fired radiant burner tubes, gas burner
nozzle liners, heat exchangers, thermowells, core busters or flame
dispersers and other gas fired furnace components.  Robert G. Smith
reports that the composite includes ceramic oxide fibers, a coating
of a carbonaceous matrix which includes boron nitride particles,
and a silicon carbide coating.

Radiant burner tubes are used in high temperature, corrosive
environments such as are found in industrial heat treating furnaces
and aluminum melting furnaces.  The three most common types of
commercially available radiant burner tubes are metal alloy, e.g.,
nickel-based superalloy, tubes; ceramic, e.g., silicon carbide,
monolith tubes; and ceramic composite, e.g., ceramic fibers and
ceramic cloth in a ceramic matrix, tubes.  The upper use
temperature of such tubes is typically 900-1260(C.

Although monolithic silicon carbide radiant burner tubes with an
upper use a temperature limit of about 1260(C are available, they
are generally brittle and prone to fail.  This is a common problem
of conventional shaped ceramic monoliths.  While it is possible to
select a conventional ceramic composite from which to prepare a
radiant burner tube which meets most of the requirements for use in
high temperature, chemically corrosive environments, it is only
possible by taking great care in the selection of materials and by
making some compromises in properties.

The carbon matrix or coating uses amorphous carbon and has a
thickness of up to one micrometer on an individual fiber.  The 3M
product includes 20-50% by weight ceramic oxide fibers, 0.2-20.0%
by weight carbonaceous matrix, 0.2-15.0% by weight boron nitride,
and 50-75% by weight silicon carbide.  U.S. Patent 5,476,684 was
assigned for this invention.

Zirconium Lowers
Smoke Generation

Flame retarded wool fibers with a zirconium-based finish are the
choice of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group (Pacific Highway S.,
Seattle, WA 98188; Tel: 206/394-3111) for use in decorative
applications in commercial aircraft, says the company's Sally A.
Hasselbrack.  Although the company is continuing to perfect these
materials, the zirconium materials have shown an outstanding
acceptance of dyestuffs, inherent resistance to burning, ease of
flame retardance, and great capacity to tolerate the wear and tear
of service in aircraft.

Hasselbrack credits the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
Regulation (FAR) 25, Appendix F, Part II with facilitating the new
flammability testing that will save many lives in post-crash fires.
The regulation uses a more realistic ignition source to initiate
combustion during simulations of post-crash fires.  It also
mandates retroactive coverage for the entire U.S. commercial air
fleet.  The Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft were the first to include
design guidelines stipulating the incorporation of materials with
limited smoke and toxic gas emission whenever possible.

Early technology for decorative fibers in aircraft interiors
incorporated the use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) fibers in the warp
and a phosphorus-based flame retardant finish on the wool filling
yarns.  Research performed at the Ilkley, West Yorkshire, U.K.-
based International Wool Secretariat (IWC) then led to a zirconium
and titanium compound-based Zirpro flame retarding finish for wool
fibers.

Requirements for textile products applied to vertical surfaces,
e.g., wall tapestries, are covered by FAR 25 amendments.  To meet
these requirements, tetrabromophthalic acid (TBPA) is used in
combination with the Zirpro treatment.  The success of this system
is due to the synergism between the zirconium finish, which works
in the solid phase, and the organobromine acid, which works in the
vapor phase.  The IWC, newly renamed Wools of New Zealand (WNZ),
recommends two forms of the TBPA compound: an emulsified paste with
a 40% bromine content, and a liquid form of disodium salt of
tetrabromophthalic anhydride with a 15% bromine content.

The utilization of TBPA is an essential part of Boeing's washable
wool program, the company's latest area of interest for flame
retarded wool.  When flame retardant washable wool first became
available, about 10 years ago, shrinkage after the first laundering
was 5-7%.  Shrinkage with subsequent launderings was minimal.
Since a strong correlation exists between dimensional stability and
abrasion, or wear resistance, Boeing did not initially use the
product.  As more Boeing 737s were sold to developing nations, the
company received an increasing number of requests for a washable
flame retardant product that would meet the shrinkage and
appearance requirements of the airline industry.  A new effort was
initiated to reduce shrinkage to 2% over 15 launderings.

The WNZ says that any type of shrink resistant process must be
compatible with the Zirpro process, because the Zirpro process is
the only existing flame retardant process for wool durable to
washing.  The organization's suggested techniques for the shrink
treatment of wool include a chlorine-based treatment applied to the
fiber in its worsted tops form, and to the woven, dyed fabric by a
padding process.  WNZ recommends that the weight of the fabric
should not fall below 11 ounces per square yard (oz/yd2) and that
only 100% wool fabrics should be used.  Both shrinkage and
appearance retention are improved by using a tightly woven fabric.
At 14 oz/yd2 the materials can withstand 19-20 launderings.

Lowering the Rate
of Heat Release

Helping furniture manufacturers produce upholstered furniture with
low rates of heat release is the intent of researchers at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg,
MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab (BFRL).  Thomas
Ohlemiller (Tel: 301/975-6481) of BFRL's Fire Science Div. finds
that the flammability of upholstered furniture continues to be a
substantial problem in both residential and public occupancies.

Both smoldering and flaming ignition problems exist.  The
smoldering problem, existing primarily in residences, is being
addressed through a voluntary industry program and by the
consideration of regulations covering cigarette ignition
propensity.  The flaming ignition problem and its consequences in
terms of heat release are being addressed in differing manners,
depending on the type of occupancy in the building in which the
furniture is used.  California Technical Bulletin 133 requires that
public occupancy furniture respond to an arson-like 18 kilowatt
(kW) igniter with a peak heat release rate of 80 kW.

This severe test has encouraged the development of barrier
technology, which involves a protective fabric layer in upholstery
between the foam and the outer layer of fabric.  Such technology is
believed to be cost effective since it is not meeting strong
industry resistance.  On the other hand, there are so many
variables in furniture design that only very large companies are
able to perform the large number of empirical tests needed to
ensure compliance across their product line.  This, coupled with
the technical attractiveness of barriers for controlling heat
release in any upholstered furniture, has prompted BFRL's ongoing
efforts to develop a quantitative understanding of the various
factors that control the heat release curve using mockups
containing various barrier fabrics.

In the study, BFRL will characterize the relationships between
small scale test data and full scale mockup behavior.  The focus is
on mockups containing a barrier fabric.  The results of related
work by the Association for Contract Textiles and the European
Community will also be considered.  After completing the barrier
effects of several fabrics in  a fixed mockup geometry, BFRL will
systematically vary the geometry.  This calls for a series of
mockups involving a very limited material selection, but wide
variations in seat, seatback and arm cushion dimensions.

Curable Printed
Circuit Boards

Curable flame retardant resins intended for use as the basic
material in printed circuit boards has been prepared by Gurit-Essex
(Papiermuhlestrasse 155, CH 3063 Ittigen-Bern, Switzerland; Tel: 31
580388) scientists.  Herbert Schriber, Gunter Burkart, and Bruno
Knaus report that the new formulation includes a thermally curable
1-oxa-3-aza tetraline group-containing compound, a curable epoxy
compound, and a flame retardant.  The flame retardant additive may
be aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, elemental red
phosphorus, oxygen acids of phosphorus, inorganic salts of oxygen
acids of phosphorus, polyphosphates, boric acid, or salts of boric
acid.

Although bromine-based flame retardant additives impart the
required flame retardance to resins used in the manufacture of
printed circuit boards, they can generate poisonous and/or
corrosive gases when exposed to fire.  As a result the Gurit-Essex
researchers sought a nonhalogenated alternative to flame retard the
resins.  U.S. Patent 5,443,911 explains the Gurit-Essex work in
detail.

Formulation Doesn't
Corrode Machinery

A new transparent, flame retardant, aromatic, polycarbonate resin
formulated by scientists at Teijin, Ltd. (1-11 Minamihonmachi,
Higashi-Ku, Osaka 541, Japan; Tel: 6/268 2132, Fax: 6/266 1481)
does not corrode the molding machinery used to process the resin
into plastic components.  Masahiro Miyouga and Shinichi Souda
report that the new resin is highly transparent and includes 100
parts by weight of an aromatic polycarbonate resin, 0.01-1.00 part
by weight of a perfluoroalkane-sulfonic acid alkali salt and 0.02-
2.00 parts by weight of a halogenated triaryl phosphate flame
retardant in which at least one halogen atom is substituted on the
ring-forming carbon of each aromatic hydrocarbon group.

Aromatic polycarbonate resins have many excellent properties which
facilitate their widespread use, but they are also quite
combustible and require high loadings of flame retardant additives
when used in applications where flame retardancy is required.
Several conventional methods for imparting this flame retardancy
are used.

One is the incorporation of an organic halogen compound.  For
example, a polycarbonate oligomer obtained from tetrabromobisphenol
A as a dihydroxy component is often used in amounts that make the
bromine concentration in the final resin 5-15% by weight.  In
another instance, a carbonate copolymer obtained from
tetrabromobisphenol A and bisphenol A as dihydroxy components is
used in amounts to make the bromine concentration 5-9% by weight.
The problem is that when an aromatic polycarbonate resin containing
such a bromine-based flame retardant is molded or processed, the
machinery will most likely corrode.

Increasing the bromine concentration increases the corrosion.  The
goal of the Teijin researchers was to develop an aromatic
polycarbonate resin that would reduce corrosive tendencies, while
maintaining excellent flame retardancy.

One approach is the use of formulations that include 100 parts by
weight of a halogen-free conventional polycarbonate resin with a
molecular weight of 10,000-30,000, 5-60 parts by weight of a
halogen-free ultrahigh molecular-weight polycarbonate resin with a
molecular weight of 100,000-250,000 and 5-20% by weight of a flame
retardant.  The use of ultrahigh molecular weight resins is
expensive, though, and handling such materials is difficult.  In
addition, the resulting compositions have low transparency, and
their molding and processing characteristics are only mediocre.

Bromine-free flame retardants may also be used in conventional
molecular weight aromatic polycarbonate resins.  For example,
potassium perfluoroalkanesulfonate decreases the production of
corrosive gas, but, when used in high enough loadings to impart
sufficient flame retardancy, it decreases the heat stability of the
resin.

The Teijin breakthrough was the discovery that when potassium
perfluoroalkanesulfonate is combined with a small amount of
halogenated triaryl phosphate and incorporated into an aromatic
polycarbonate resin, the resin maintains its flame retardancy and
transparency can be retained, but corrosive tendencies are
decreased.  The perfluoroalkane-sulfonic acid alkali salt contains
an alkyl group with 1-8 carbon atoms, and the hydrogen atoms of the
alkyl group are replaced by fluorine atoms.  The alkali metal in
the salt is potassium or sodium.

Other examples of usable salts include potassium
perfluorobutanesulfonate and sodium perfluorooctanesulfonate. The
halogenated triaryl phosphate flame retardant must be free of
impurities such as salts and phosphate ester halides.  These
impurities cause turbidity and decreased transparency in the final
resin.  The Teijin work is more fully described in U.S. Patent
5,478,874.

New Encapsulant for
Semiconductor Devices

A new flame retardant epoxy molding compound, formulated by
researchers at Dexter Corp. (Franklin St., Olean, NY 14760; Tel:
716/372-6300, Fax: 716/372-6864), is intended for use in the
encapsulation of semiconductor devices.  Anthony A. Gallo reports
that epoxy resin compounds have often been used for encapsulation
of semiconductor devices such as integrated circuits (IC), large
scale integrated circuits (LSI), transistors, and diodes and other
electronic components.  Such encapsulants generally comprise an
epoxy, a hardener, a catalyst, a mold release agent, a filler, a
colorant, a coupling agent and a flame retardant system.

Conventional flame retardant epoxy molding compounds use systems
that can include halogenated compounds, transition metal oxides and
hydrated alumina.  The problem is that at high temperatures, these
flame retardant additives detract from the compatibility of the
encapsulant with semiconductor devices.  Other applicable flame
retardant systems include an organic phosphine compound and
antimony oxide; and antimony trioxide or antimony tetraoxide and
halogenated compounds.

Although these conventional flame retardant combinations provide
reasonable flame retardance and satisfactory compatibility on
electronic devices, the Dexter researchers believed that there was
a need for products with improved high temperature compatibility
and performance, and lower cost and toxicity.

The new Dexter formulation, detailed in U.S. Patent 5,476,716,
includes an epoxy, a novolac or anhydride type hardener, a
catalyst, a mold release agent, a filler, a colorant and a coupling
agent.  The flame retardant system includes a halogen-containing
organic compound, and either antimony pentoxide or magnesium oxide.
The halogen-containing organic compound may include either chlorine
or bromine.  Examples include polyglycidyl ether of
bromophenolformaldehyde novolac, halogenated bisphenol A and its
derivatives such as tetrabromobisphenol A, and glycidyl ethers of
halogenated resins such as the diglycidyl ether of
tetrabromobisphenol A.

3M Continues Quest
of Halon Alternatives

Omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ether compounds can be used as chemical fire
extinguishing agents in streaming applications, total flooding and
explosion suppression and inertion, report scientists at 3M (St.
Paul, MN 55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110).  These chemicals are under
consideration as replacements in fire extinguishing applications
wherein applications where chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) or halons have been used.

Because of a steady flow of bad news about the damaged
stratospheric ozone layer, the deadlines for the end to
industrialized countries' production of CFCs and other ozone
depleting chemicals were accelerated by countries who are parties
to the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone
Layer.  Research has been initiated to replace all CFCs and halons,
such as CCl2F2, CCl3F, CF3Br and CCl2FCClF2, with substitute or
alternative compounds and technologies.

A number of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), e.g., CH2FCF3, or HFC-134a,
are being used or have been proposed as CFC substitutes.  HFC-134a
is more ozone friendly.  HCFCs, such as CH3CCl2F, or HCFC-141b, are
CFC substitutes, but although they are not nearly as damaging,
these substitutes do carry ozone depleting chlorine into the
stratosphere.  Another proposed substitute is the simple omega-
hydrodifluoromethyl perfluoromethyl ether (CF3OCF2H).

Omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ethers formulated by 3M are hydrophobic and
less oleophobic than the perfluoroalkyl ether analogs, chemically
inert, thermally stable, water insoluble and normally liquid at
20(C.  They can be produced in high yield and high purity and with
a wide range of molecular weights.  The covalent bond between the
omega-hydrogen and terminal carbon, i.e., the carbon-hydrogen bond,
is generally degradable by atmospheric photooxidation, making the
omega-hydrofluoroalkyl ethers environmentally acceptable.

3M's George G.I. Moore discloses that these normally liquid, omega-
hydrofluoroalkyl ether compounds (and some their mixtures) have a
saturated perfluoroaliphatic chain of carbon atoms interrupted by
one or more ether oxygen atoms.  The compounds can be prepared by
the decarboxylation of the corresponding fluoroalkyl ether
carboxylic acids.  U.S. Patent 5,476,974 details the 3M omega-
hydrofluoroalkyl ethers.

Testing the Limits
of Replacements

The lean flammability limit of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacement
refrigerants will be ascertained by a team of researchers at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg,
MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab (BFRL).  Carole
Womeldorf (Tel: 301/975-4415) of BFRL's Fire Science Div. reports
that hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)-32 and a mixture of HFC-32 and HFC-125
are the refrigerants under study.  These materials are being
considered as replacements for ozone depleting CFCs.

A critical element in the risk analysis of alternative refrigerants
is the lean flammability limit.  Variations in the flammability
limit can occur, depending on the initial conditions chosen for
conducting the test.  There is a need to eliminate these variations
and to establish invariant, fundamental lean flammability limits
which can be attributed to refrigerant mixtures in a manner similar
to fundamental thermodynamic properties like enthalpy of formation
and adiabatic flame temperature.

BFRL will modify an existing burner facility to operate in a
symmetrical, adiabatic mode with independent control of the gaseous
refrigerant and air flows.  The burner will be calibrated using
methane to ensure that the facility is capable of reproducing the
published values of the lean flammability limit.  Stoichiometric
flames of HFC-32 and air will be examined.  The flow velocity will
be varied to establish the extinction strain rate and to identify
the dynamic range of the burner using a less flammable fuel.  The
fuel/air equivalence ratio will be varied about the stoichiometric
point, and the strain rate will be adjusted to identify the most
robust mixture (normally slightly rich for hydrocarbon flames).

The lean flammability limit of HFC-32 can be found using the zero
strain rate extrapolation method.  The critical flammability ratio
can be found by slowly increasing the fraction of HFC-125 in the
HFC/air mixture while maintaining the overall equivalence ratio and
strain rate, or by fixing the concentrations of all constituents
and slowly increasing the strain rate by reducing the spacing
between the upper and lower burners.

M.A. Hanna to
Acquire CIMCO

M.A. Hanna Co. (200 Public Square, Cleveland, OH 44114; Tel:
216/589-4000) has a preliminary agreement to acquire all of the
outstanding capital stock of CIMCO, Inc. (Briggs Ave., Costa Mesa,
CA 92626; Tel: 714/546-4460), a producer of thermoplastic compounds
and plastic components.  M.A. Hanna manufactures flame retardant
plastics, rubber and color and additive concentrates and
distributes plastic resins and engineered components.

The company, in a move that it says is "consistent with its
strategy of being an intermediary between the polymer producer and
end product manufacturer," intends to sell CIMCO's plastic
components business and retain the plastics compounding operations.
T. Russell Gilbert, president and CEO of CIMCO and CIMCO's largest
shareholder, says M.A. Hanna, will buy the molded components
business as a going concern shortly after completing the
acquisition of CIMCO is completed.  Gilbert owns 615,984 shares, or
21%, of the CIMCO shares outstanding.

CIMCO's plastics compounding businesses, which operate as
Compounding Technology, Inc. (CTI), are located in Singapore;
Corona, CA; and Charlotte, NC.  "The acquisition of CTI helps us on
three fronts to have a more balanced market profile," says Martin
D. Walker, M.A. Hanna chairman and CEO.  "First we will grow our
international business."  CTI provides M.A. Hanna with an excellent
basis for growth in Asia.

In fact, the operation in Singapore is CTI's largest.  CTI is also
in the process of expanding its production capabilities into
Europe.  Second, CTI's strong engineering plastics business will
add breadth to our specialty compounding portfolio throughout the
world.  Finally, we are able to build a stronger position in the
electrical, electronics and business machines markets."

States Adopt NFPA
Life Safety Code

Continuing their ongoing commitment to keeping citizens safer from
fire, officials in Alabama, Delaware, Maine, Maryland and Tennessee
have adopted the 1994 edition of the National Fire Protection Assn.
(NFPA, One Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269-9101) trademarked
Life Safety Code.  The Life Safety code, which provides basic
requirements for safety in buildings during emergencies, includes
provisions for building design, construction, operation and
maintenance to protect occupants from fire, smoke and toxic gases.

The latest edition of the code ensures that public safety
requirements are current and continue to be met.  NFPA works with
local authorities to help them implement code requirements and
encourages officials to adopt updated versions of its codes and
standards.

In the U.S., all health care facilities that receive Medicare or
Medicaid funding must comply with the Life Safety Code, according
to federal requirements.  To date, 33 states have adopted and
enforce the code, which requires that new and existing buildings
allow for "prompt escape" or that a means to provide people with a
reasonable degree of safety is considered.  Key provisions include
requirements that locks and hardware on doors must be installed to
permit free escape, exits must be marked by readily visible signs,
any door in a means of egress must be capable of swinging to the
open position to allow for the full use of the opening, and
evacuation signals must be audible and visible.

"Adoption and enforcement of state-of-the-art codes and standards
is a proven method for reducing fire loss," says NFPA president
George D. Miller.  "In some way virtually every building, process,
service, design and installation is affected by the codes and
standards developed through NFPA's open consensus codes- and
standards-making system."

Fire and Nonfire
Signals Differ

A better way to differentiate the patterns of fire and nonfire
signals using multiple sensors is the subject of a project at the
University of Maryland (College Park, MD 20742; Tel: 301/405-1000).
Thomas J. McAvoy reports that incorporating intelligence into a
fire detector so that it can recognize signature patterns is
intended to permit prompt fire detection, while allowing the
detector to discriminate between signatures from fire and nonfire
sources.  The primary purpose of this initial University of
Maryland work was to investigate the patterns of signatures
associated fire and environmental sources using small scale
experiments.

The scientists generated products from a wide range of conditions,
from flaming or pyrolyzing samples to heated samples and those
obtained with an atomizer.  They also measured gas concentrations,
light obscuration and temperature to characterize the products.  In
analyzing the data, they were able to identify trends from which an
elementary expert system can be built to identify the source of
airborne products.

McAvoy, writing in Fire and Technology, 31(2), reports that several
patterns were evident.  The maximum carbon dioxide (CO2)
concentrations achieved during experiments with flaming fires are
significantly greater than the maximum CO2 concentrations achieved
during experiments with nonflaming fires (pyrolyzing fires, heated
liquids and environmental odors).  The nonflaming sources can be
identified based on the carbon monoxide (CO) and metal oxide sensor
peak measurements.  Except for three experiments using pyrolyzing
solids, the peak CO concentration is greater--though the detector
response is less--for nonflaming fires than for environmental
sources.

The researchers built and tested an elementary neural network which
properly classified all fires except for one pyrolyzing event.
Based on this preliminary work, commercial fire detection systems
based on the analysis of airborne products appears feasible.
Additional research is needed to identify the optimum types and
number of sensors that should be coupled to provide prompt
detection between various sources.

Smoke and Dust
Particles Sensed

A smoke detector capable of sensing both smoke and fine particles
such as dust has been constructed by engineers at Hochiki Corp. (2-
10-43 Kamiosaki, Shinagawa-Ku, Tokyo, Japan; Tel: 3/444 4111, Fax:
3/447 1388).  Conventional  photoelectric analog smoke sensors
include a light emitting chamber and a light receiving chamber.
The light receiving chamber is placed in a position where it does
not directly receive light from the light emitting chamber.

Diffused light caused by smoke is detected in the light receiving
chamber, and a signal corresponding to the smoke density is
obtained.  A drive circuit for light emitting elements such as
light emitting diodes (LEDs) is located in the light emitting
chamber, and a light receiving signal amplifying circuit with an
element, such as a photodiode, is located in the light receiving
chamber.  When diffused light caused by smoke is detected by the
light receiving element, a signal at a level corresponding to the
smoke density is photoelectrically converted by the photodiode and
then amplified.  In this way, a conventional smoke detector obtains
the analog signal having output characteristics required by an
automatic fire notification system.

The problem is that in such an analog sensor, the integrated amount
of diffused light is detected.  As a result, only a small amount of
light is present in the area where the volume of fine particles
caused by a fire is small.  It is, therefore, not possible to
detect a very small amount of smoke generated in the initial period
of a fire.  Since fine particles such as dust cannot be detected by
the these sensors, it is not possible to distinguish dust and water
vapor from smoke, nor to distinguish environmental abnormalities
such as the contamination of the inside of the chamber at the same
time smoke is detected.

Atsushi Manmoto and Yukio Yamauchi report that the Hochiki detector
makes use of a light emitting device that projects a light beam
onto a monitor area.  A light receiving device is arranged so that
instead of receiving the light beam directly, it receives diffused
light caused by fine particles, i.e., dust or smoke, entering the
monitor area.  The output from the light receiving device is
amplified and counted and its average value per unit of time is
computed.  The result is that the signals caused by environmental
dust and smoke from fires can be differentiated, leading to a more
reliable instrument.  U.S. Patent 5,477,218 fully describes the
Hochiki work.

Checking Accuracy
of Fire Models

Researchers at Clemson University (Dept. of Mathematical Sciences,
Clemson, SC 29634-1907; Tel: 803/656-2616) have completed a
prototype sensitivity analysis capability for a fire model computer
program.  Their intent, reports Michael M. Kostreva, professor of
Mathematical Sciences, was to analyze the approach of the existing
HAZARD I fire model and to evaluate and demonstrate newly obtained
results on the mathematical foundations of fire models.

While HAZARD I is an established computer tool for modeling fires
in residential buildings, it lacks sensitivity analysis
capabilities.  Such a feature would allow users to better
understand the influence of certain input data on the computational
results.  This understanding could be translated into better use of
resources for gathering data and generally enhanced credibility of
the modeling results.  HAZARD I has successfully incorporated a
succession of increasingly complex fire models, including FAST,
CFAST and CONRAD 2.  A corresponding set of models equipped with
sensitivity analysis capabilities are needed.

Earlier approaches to fire model sensitivity analysis made use of
the simple ASET model.  The Clemson approach involved the ASET,
FAST, CFAST and CONRAD 2 models.  These include local methods of
finite difference type, along with the direct methods which use
some additional differential equations.  Global methods, which
involve averaging over a collection of preselected scenarios, were
not considered.

The results, relevant sets of input parameters and model outputs,
were accumulated in tabular form.  Examples of presently available
zone fire models have been assembled, along with the relevant
parameters for fires involving up to four rooms.  Kostreva found
that a limited sensitivity analysis, considering a carefully
selected subset of input parameters, is feasible, even for the more
complex models.  The graphical presentation of the results
facilitate a good quantitative understanding of the underlying
relationships.

MIT Simulates
Fire Plumes

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, Dept. of Mechanical
Engineering, Cambridge, MA 02139) scientists are building a
computationally-based large fire plume model in which buoyant fluid
mechanics, combustion, radiative transport and their mutual
interactions are all fundamentally represented using physically
sound approximations.  Ahmed F. Ghoniem (Tel: 617/253-2295) reports
that the approximations will be well resolved, both spatially and
temporally.  The model's computational efficiency, achieved by
simulating each of the processes, will allow the performance of
practical simulations on an advanced engineering workstation.

The simulation of fire plumes yielding burning rates, pollutant
formation rates and the radiation field is necessary as a tool for
the assessment of the environmental impact of large fires.
Computational modeling of these fires is complicated by the
presence of several complex physical processes, including
turbulence, transport and chemistry.  The wide range of physical
scales in these processes complicates their numerical modeling even
further.  The overall dynamics of the process is essentially
unsteady, and conventional numerical approaches could be very
expensive, since the domains of these fires are often extremely
large.

To overcome these difficulties, the MIT investigators are preparing
a computational model of fire plumes based on a simulation of all
of the significant physical processes involved.  They are employing
the vortex method to obtain solutions of some of the equations
involved, including the buoyancy and baroclinic terms, using
computational elements distributed along the layer separating the
plume (fuel and products) and the surrounding air and products in
the turbulent regime.

Mixing and combustion processes are simulated using the transport
element method in which only species concentration and temperature
gradients are computed, and only where vortex elements exist.  Fast
chemistry assumption is used in the computation of the burning
rate, temperature and major species distribution.  The
concentration of the computational elements within the narrow zone
of plume boundaries provides this approach with the necessary
efficiency.

An extensive validation study of both the isothermal plume and the
reacting plume models has been performed.  For the isothermal
plume, the relationship between the puffing frequency and the pool
diameter has been established and the results compared with
experimental data.  For the reacting case, they repeated the same
study and obtained good agreement with experimental data.

In both cases, they concluded that puffing is a buoyancy
instability formed at the base of the plume near the pool due to
the tendency of the rising plume to accelerate upward, thereby
reducing the plume diameter below that of the pool.  The conical
interface is subject to gravitational instability which leads to
the roll-up of the material interface and the concomitant puffing.
This puffing is responsible for the strong entrainment field into
the fire plume and the high upward penetration of the flames.

Ghoniem's team will next incorporate a soot formation model and a
liquid-gas interface boundary condition at the pool surface.  The
soot formation model is necessary for the computation of the
radiative transport fluxes, which contribute significantly to the
fuel evaporation and pyrolysis.  The liquid-gas interface condition
is intended to establish a physical basis for determining the
vaporization rate of the fuel.  A radiative-based transport
algorithm will also be constructed and incorporated.

Occupant and Fuel
Load Determined

A project at the University of Maryland (College Park, MD 20742;
Tel: 301/405-1000) is intended to provide a method for determining
the occupant load in a wide variety of both open plan and
compartmented office buildings for use in fire safety planning.
James A. Milke reports that the work will also determine how to
collect fuel load data for office spaces.  The problem is that
questions have been raised concerning the accuracy of currently
accepted occupant and fuel loads.  The subject arose after
preliminary studies were conducted in open plan and compartmented
office buildings.

The researchers first reviewed current occupant load survey
procedures and data collection forms.  In an occupant load
analysis, two parameters are needed: the number of building
occupants at any given time and the area of floor space.  The
approach is to count building occupants present during a survey
along with unoccupied workstations which appear to be occupied
under normal conditions.  Counting individuals not actually at
their workstations is an obvious source of inaccuracy.  In
addition, an improved methodology would account for guests or
visitors in a given building, along with people involved with
maintenance and custodial work and building contractors.  Most of
these individuals may be readily identified due to their different
working attire.

A preliminary version of a revised data collection form and
procedure was then prepared which reduces the obvious inaccuracies
in the conventional approach.  The new approach was then
successfully used to conduct occupant load surveys in public and
private sector office spaces in the metropolitan Washington, DC,
area.  The research team is now preparing their approach for
evaluating the fuel load evaluation which involves surveying office
spaces prepared for moving.  It is said to significantly simplify
the current procedure which includes weighing or estimating the
weight of the materials in office spaces.

Characterizing Polymer
Flammability at NIST

Characterizing polymer flammability is the objective of a new
project at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001) Building and Fire Research Lab
(BFRL).  Jeffrey Gilman (Tel: 301/975-6573) and Takashi Kashiwagi
(Tel: 301/975-6699), both of BFRL's Fire Science Div., will
determine the chemical structure of polymer residues generated
under well defined fire conditions for the purpose of determining
the links between original polymer structure, nonhalogenated
additives, char characteristics and flammability properties of
polymeric materials.

Two trends starting to significantly affect the U.S. plastics
industry are polymer recycling and a demand for nonhalogenated
flame retardant treatments.  The degradation products of polymers
flame retarded with halogenated additives are corrosive, and some
may be toxic.  One alternative approach to flame retarding polymers
is to form a char during burning.  This approach is ideal in that
carbon atoms retained in the condensed phase, as char, lessen the
available fuel for flaming combustion even as they help to insulate
the polymer from the heat of the flame.  Presently, though, there
is very little quantitative information about the relationship
between polymer structure, char properties, the effect of
nonhalogenated additives and realistic flammability properties.

BFRL will evaluate polymer/additive systems using its cone
calorimeter to find those with improved flammability behavior.
Preceramic polymer/organic polymer blends will be prepared and
evaluated.  The solid state decomposition chemistry of the
promising candidates will then be characterized, and samples at
intermediate stages of composition will be generated from the
preceramic/organic polymer blends in an inert flow pyrolysis
apparatus at many different temperatures.  Char yield,
aromatic/aliphatic ratio and crosslink density will be measured.

For higher heating rate conditions, the samples will be evaluated
under fire-like, nonoxidizing conditions in a gasification
apparatus which exposes large compression molded 100 gram disk
samples to a radiant heat source of 25-40 kilowatts per square
meter in a gaseous nitrogen atmosphere.  Gaseous degradation
products for the selected polymer samples.

BOOKS

International
Perspective

Fire Standards in the International Marketplace, published by the
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), offers a new
view of fire standards from an international perspective.  Leading
researchers in the field from France, England, and the U.S. have
presented material in three areas of concern.

First, the Test Method Development section covers the cone
calorimeter, including its development, standardization, and
future; three smoke test method evaluations; and a review and
comparison of ASTM and international fire standards.  The second
part of the book, International Aspects of Fire Standards, deals
with worldwide developments in fire safety engineering and
Eurocodes for structural fire designs.  Fire Performance in the
Real World, the volume's third section, covers fire resistance
testing controversies and the history, development, and future of
fire resistive joints.

The book, reports ASTM, is aimed at individuals and companies
concerned with the sale and flammability of products in the
international marketplace, researchers and testing personnel in the
fire standards professions, and fire regulatory officials.  Fire
Standards in the International Marketplace is available from the
ASTM (100 Barr Harbor Dr., W. Conshohocken, PA 19428-2959; Tel:
