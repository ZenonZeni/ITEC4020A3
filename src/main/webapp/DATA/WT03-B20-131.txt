<B>FOREWORD</B>
<P>
Several years after the Three Mile Island accident, in the United
States, the Chernobyl accident completely changed the public's
perception of nuclear risk. While the first accident provided
the impetus to develop new research programmes on nuclear safety,
the second, with its human death toll and the dispersion of a
large part of the reactor core into the environment, raised a
large number of problems of &quot;management&quot; not only for
the treatment of severely exposed persons, but also for the decisions
that had to be taken affecting the population. Clearly, the national
authorities were not ready to manage an accident whose consequences
were not confined to their territory.
<P>
The way the accident was managed and the lack of information provoked
a feeling of distrust in the minds of the public that was reinforced
by the fact that radiation cannot be perceived by humans and also
that it is easily detected even at a very low level. The prospect
of contaminated food, aggravated by ambiguous, even contradictory
recommendations by national authorities, gave rise to a variety
of reactions, and sometimes overreactions, in the management of
the accident consequences in several European countries.
<P>
In the country of the accident itself, where political, social
and economic conditions were worsening, the association of the
Soviet regime with nuclear activities contributed to raise feelings
of mistrust towards the public authorities. 
<P>
Ten years later, many improvements in radiation protection and
emergency preparedness have been made possible by the Chernobyl
experience and we are also able to arrive at a more accurate assessment
of the impact of this accident. The fact remains that the future
consequences in terms of health effects remain imprecise for simple
technical reasons, and, because of this, lend themselves to a
competition between those who want to minimise the consequences
of the accident and those who wish to promote a catastrophic assessment.
<P>
In these circumstances, having discussed in 1994 the question
of the future of radiation protection with the dawning of the
next millenium <I>(NE94)</I>, the NEA Committee on Radiation Protection
and Public Health (CRPPH) wished to make an honest assessment,
ten years on of the accident, on the state of the contaminated
territories and the state of health of the populations and, on
this basis, to attempt an appreciation of the risks to be expected
not only for man but also for his environment.
<P>
This review does not end there. The CRPPH also details the lessons
that have been learned by Member countries and the international
organisations such as the ICRP, the IAEA, the EC, the WHO, etc.
It has also organised international emergency exercises, the INEX
Programme. Information between States and the public has been
considerably expanded.
<P>
The accident was followed by numerous assistance and research
programmes supported by international organisations and bilateral
agreements. All these organisations are or will be publishing
their results. This report differs from those in that it is a
synthetic consensus view aimed at those persons who wish to know
the salient points without having to go into the technical details
which one can find elsewhere.
<P>
We thank all those organisations (UNSCEAR, FAO, WHO, EC) which
have put information at our disposal so that this report could
be as up to date as possible. However, those Agencies are still
generating a large amount of information to be submitted to the
forthcoming international Conference &quot;One Decade After Chernobyl&quot;
to be held in April 1996, some of which could not be made available
in time for incorporation into this report.
<P>
The report was drafted by Dr. Peter Waight (Canada) under the
direction of an editing committee chaired by Dr. Henri M&eacute;tivier
(France). The members of the Editing Committee were:
