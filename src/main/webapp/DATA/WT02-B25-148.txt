<p align=left><font color="#000000">The following is an excerpt from an article in the Aug. 22, 1993 edition of the Hartford 
Courant, by Pamela S. Wagner, a freelance writer. She has been suffering from 
schizophrenia for many years.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><em>&quot;... If a person is in an accident because of drunken driving, no one refuses to 
set his or her broken bones or charges enormous copayments. And yet this is 
precisely the case with mental illness, which is no more the patient's fault 
than arthritis or diabetes or heart disease and may be just as chronically 
disabling. </em></font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><em>&quot;We need to stop blaming the mentally ill, stop assuming that mental illness is 
different from other forms of illness, a moral failing, a matter of good and evil 
instead of a disease like any other. We need to fund more research and 
provide accessible intervention and treatment so that lives are not wasted, so 
that the mentally ill have a chance to live reasonably happy and productive 
lives ...&quot;</em></font></p>

<h3 align=left><font color="#000000">Event Instructions</font></h3>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">BEFORE THE EVENT: PLANNING</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Recruit volunteers from your affiliate as early as possible. Decide if you 
want to work with other AMI affiliates in your area. Invite local 
representatives from national mental health/illness organizations to 
participate in the planning: Depressive and Manic Depressive Association, 
the Psychiatric Society, Community Mental Health Center, Mental Health 
Association. Your AMI group is the catalyst for bringing these groups 
together locally.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Meet with participating AMI members and representatives from other 
organizations to plan the event. Describe the theme for the vigil, paint a 
mental picture of the event, outline basic tasks and responsibilities. Give 
people time to brainstorm and incorporate their ideas into the plans. Decide 
which organizations will be cosponsors of the event. What contribution 
will each organization make: volunteers labor, funds, speakers, publicity, 
copying, etc.? What other community organizations might you want to 
include?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Appoint a chairperson, someone who is enthusiastic about the event, has the 
time, talent and energy to rally the troops and supervise organization of the 
event. This person will be responsible for establishing a budget and 
soliciting donations from the community for supplies, props, etc.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Assign members and volunteers to committees with specific tasks:</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Program, Entertainment &amp; Refreshments, Publicity, Decorations &amp; Signs </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Develop an overall event checklist which incorporates checklists and 
deadlines for all committees.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Send invitations to appropriate members of the community: Patients from 
local hospitals/CMHCs, members of area psychosocial rehabilitation 
clubhouses, area doctors and mental health professionals, city council 
members, state legislators, local police department, jail officials, religious 
groups, etc. Follow up these invitations with phone calls.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Decide what symbols you want to incoporate in the vigil to illustrate 
people living with a mental illness. Possibly a display of art by individuals 
with brain disorders, a photo display of faces of an illness/illnesses, or a 
visual of how many lives are touched by an illness.</font></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p align=left><font color="#000000">COMMITTEES: TASKS AND NOTES</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><em>Program Committee</em></font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Pick a good location ASAP. Select a space of appropriate size for the 
candlelight vigil. A group of 10 will look lost in a space set up for 75. A 
central and attractive location, familiar to the media makes a site desirable. 
Most cities have one or two sites that are especially popular, a town 
square, steps of a government building, at a CMHC or state hospital. In 
some cases, it makes good sense to hold the candlelight vigil at an unusual 
site. But, avoid sites that are too far away from downtown. TV assignment 
editors are unlikely to send a crew on a 2-hour journey for a 45-second 
story. If you need advice about desirable locations, ask the local media or 
call a local PR consultant.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Prepare the space. Check for all physical arrangements you may need, such 
as accessibility, PA system, electrical and telephone outlets, restrooms, etc.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Get permits ASAP. Check all local ordinances and get everything in 
writing. Do you need security? Do you need to appoint volunteer 
marshalls?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Find speakers/leaders. Find a multi-cultural mix of speakers, including 
consumers, siblings, young families, interfaith clergy, etc.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Print programs if desired.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Create a checklist of items needed for the day of the vigil, including a mike 
or bullhorn, phone numbers of key volunteers, permits, printed programs, 
etc. </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Distribute flyers to encourage people to bring family photos with them to 
the vigil. Do this far enough in advance so that people have enough time to 
get photos ready, but close enough to the actual day that they won't forget! 
Suggested date for distribution: September 1.</font></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><em>Entertainment &amp; Refreshments Committee</em></font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Coordinate music for the pre-program and the finale with the program 
committee. How much time is allotted? Are there consumers who are 
willing to perform?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Check noise ordinances. Do you need electrical outlets for equipment?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Be sure that there is (at least) water available for vigil participants. Can 
you solicit a donation from a local vendor for refreshments? </font></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><em>Publicity Committee</em></font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Create a checklist of tasks. Develop realistic deadlines and stick to them! 
The candlelight vigil is an easy event to plan and publicize if you give 
yourselves enough time. </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Make a complete list of prospective media attending such as print media 
reporters and editors, including photo assignment editors, TV and radio 
assignment editors. Photo editors are important since the vigil is such a 
beautiful visual event. They may assign a photographer to cover it instead 
of a reporter. We've seen dozens of fantastic pictures of last year's vigils 
from around the country.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Give proper advance notification. To distinguish your candlelight vigil 
announcement from a news release, label it &quot;media advisory.&quot; A 
fill-in-the-blanks news release and a sample media advisory are included 
in this section. Mail the release a month in advance and advisories at least 
six working days prior to the event. Call all key outlets the day before the 
event. Remember reporters are people with hearts but are often on 
deadline. Be direct and friendly but also aware that may be juggling several 
priorities and may not be able to cover the event. </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Don't forget the &quot;daybooks.&quot; In many cities, local bureaus of the Associated 
Press (AP) and/or United Press International (UPI) wire services produce 
daily calendars called daybooks, which are read closely by local 
assignment editors and reporters. Even if they haven't responded to earlier 
notices of the vigil, editors may decide to send a reporter or photographer 
after seeing it run in the daybook. Call your local AP or UPI bureau office 
to learn how to file a notice: How far in advance do you need to send the 
media advisory?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Brief your spokespersons. Reporters will want to interview consumers and 
family members for their personal perspectives. Make sure that everyone 
participating knows the key messages that they are to convey when talking 
to the media: Mental illnesses are brain disorders. They are treatable. Your 
local affiliate of NAMI, and other cosponsoring organizations, can help. 
Make sure to get either the NAMI Helpline phone number (800) 950-NAMI 
or the number of your local affiliate out there; this is a prime opportunity to 
attract new members. Also, determine who should be available to assist the 
spokesperson in responding to detailed questions. </font></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><em>Decorations &amp; Signs Committee</em></font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Prepare candles with holders to catch melting wax and shield flame from 
wind. If you buy candles from a religious supply store, you may find that 
they carry these holders, too.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Prepare large boards for photo album, artwork, and/or visuals. Special 
instructions attached.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">If you don't already have one, create banner or sign with name of your 
affiliate and/or co-sponsoring groups and organizations. Decide on the best 
way to display it.</font></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">AFTER THE EVENT: WRAP-UP</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Thank participants after the vigil, including members, cosponsors, 
speakers, entertainment, media.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Evaluate the event. Consider ways the process could be improved in the 
future.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Congratulate yourself and your hard-working committee members for a job 
well done!</font></p>
