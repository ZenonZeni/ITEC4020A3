(1) JOIN SENATOR BURNS ON HOTWIRED TONIGHT (5/13) AT 9:00 ET ON TO DISCUSS
    PRIVACY AND SECURITY ON THE NET

Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) will hold a second online 'town meeting' tonight
to discuss recently introduced encryption legislation.  The Promotion of 
Commerce Online in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996 (S.1726), sponsored
by Sen. Burns, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and others, seeks to relax outdated 
and restrictive export controls on encryption.  

This online chat is the second chance in as many weeks for Netizens to 
participate in a discussion regarding this important legislation.  We hope 
many concerned Internet users will take advantage of this rare opportunity 
to interact with a U.S. Senator who is leading the fight on an issue of great 
importance to the Net.community.

DETAILS ON TONIGHT'S EVENT:

* Monday May 13, at 9:00 pm ET (6:00 pm Pacific) on HotWired's "Wireside
  Chat".  

  URL: http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/

  To participate, you must be a registered HotWired member (there 
  is no charge for registration).  You must also have RealAudio(tm) and a
  telnet application properly configured to work with your browser.

Tonight's town meeting is the second in a series of planned events, and is
part of a broader project coordinated by CDT and the Voters
Telecommunications Watch (VTW) designed to bring the Internet Community
into the debate and encourage members of Congress to work with the
Net.community on vital Internet policy issues.

Events with other members of Congress working on Internet Policy Issues are
currently being planned. Stay tuned for future announcements.
