<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting &amp; Egg Donation offers an organized,
comprehensive program, which includes advertising, administration as well
as coordination of psychological, legal and medical services. Our surrogates
are specifically solicited, psychologically and medically screened, provided
with legal counsel and matched with the intended parents. We are proud to
offer an "open" program where the surrogate chooses her couple, then they
will meet one another prior to determining if this is the couple she would
like to work with. The Surrogate has the opportunity of finding out in person
about the couple's history, their likes and dislikes, their personality,
etc. The counselor is present at the meeting to assist with overcoming any
initial uneasiness in meeting someone for the first time and more importantly
can direct the conversation as well as encourage the discussion of important
issues.
<P>The Surrogacy process provides fertile women with the opportunity to help
childless couples create their families. They can share the joy of parenthood,
experience pregnancy again, and feel fulfilled knowing that they made someone's
dream come true.
<P>There are two surrogate programs, and deciding which is right for you
is an individual decision.
<P>
<UL><LI>Artificial Insemination Program - the Surrogate mother's egg is used
and she is artificially inseminated at an infertility clinic with a very
simple medical procedure.<BR>
<LI>In-Vitro Fertilization Program - This program is more complex. The couple
will create embryos using their own eggs and semen, then transfer the embryos
to the Surrogate Mother. Typically, the Couple and Surrogate's cycles are
synchronized to facilitate the transfer of fresh embryos and thus optimize
the chance of a conception. When there are more embryos than necessary for
a single cycle, remaining embryos can be frozen for use in a later cycle,
thus making the procedure more cost effective.
</UL><P>In both programs, an Infertility Specialist will oversee the case
until 6-8 weeks after confirmation, then release the Surrogate Mother to
the care of her own OB/GYN and local hospital.
