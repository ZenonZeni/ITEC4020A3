<h3>
Eddies are swirls of water currents spun off from a main current or that are forced by wind.  Ocean eddies last from weeks to months, have diameters of ten to hundreds of kilometers and extend deep into the ocean.  They transport an enormous amount of heat, salt and nutrients in the ocean.

<p>
Above, TOPEX/Poseidon data show where eddies occur and their sea-surface height changes.   The most rapidly swirling eddies can cause great changes in sea height -- over 25 centimeters (10 inches).  They are found with strong ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream off the east coast of the U.S.

Gulf of Mexico Eddies & Their Tie to Whale Sightings
</h2>

<p>
In late summer 1993, sperm whale sightings were correlated with eddies in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  The whale pods were found near areas of low sea surface height associated with counterclockwise circulation and the upwelling of nutrient-rich, deep waters.  In the future, TOPEX/Poseidon data will be used to monitor eddy circulation in conjunction with detailed whale studies in the Gulf of Mexico.
