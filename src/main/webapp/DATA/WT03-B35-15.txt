A PUBLIC MEETING ON GAS VALUATION ISSUES IS SET FOR JAN. 22 in Houston. The

A PUBLIC MEETING ON GAS VALUATION ISSUES IS SET FOR JAN. 22 in Houston. The
Minerals Management Service said the session is meant to gather public
comment on a proposed rulemaking, published in the Nov. 6 Federal Register,
which would implement the recommendations of the Federal Gas Valuation
Negotiated Rulemaking Committee. The panel's recommendations would amend
the rules governing the value of gas produced from federal leases.
   MMS also extended the comment period on the proposed rule until Feb. 5.
   For more information on the meeting, contact MMS' David Guzy at (303)

WESTERN STATES PLAN TO MEET OVER POSSIBLE ADOPTION OF BLM ROLES

By:
Sheryl Morris

Representatives of several Western oil and gas producing states will meet
later this month near Denver to discuss a proposal by the Clinton
administration to relinquish some of the Bureau of Land Management's
inspection and enforcement functions to the states.
Although larger producing states like New Mexico and Wyoming still have
some unanswered questions over the proposal, they believe the plan has some
merit.
   The meeting will be the first for the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact
Commission's BLM Oil and Gas Inspection and Enforcement Transfer Committee
since an organizational session at the IOGCC annual meeting in Houston last
month. Ten states have representatives on the special panel.
   Committee member, William LeMay, described the upcoming Denver session
as a ``strategy meeting'' to formulate an IOGCC consensus for presentation
to the administration. LeMay is the director of the New Mexico Oil
Conservation Division and the New Mexico governor's designated
representative to IOGCC.
   ``We think a lot of those [I&E] functions could be performed more
economically and efficiently at the state level,'' LeMay said. The key
elements, he added, are adequate funding and site-specific regulations.
   ``The same thing that's required on federal lands on the California
coastline wouldn't apply to some of the deserts in New Mexico,'' LeMay
pointed out in urging tailored regulations. ``We don't want to just be an
enforcement arm of federal rules and regulations,'' he added.
   Wyoming may be interested in the transfer if the move saves money and
both the federal government and the state benefit, said another committee
member, Donald Basko, supervisor of the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation
Commission.
   ``But if we have to follow in their footsteps'' as the land manager and
no savings result, ``then there may be no interest in taking it over,''
Basko said. ``We can maybe accomplish the same thing with fewer people and
less money, but that remains to be seen.''
   As part of Vice President Gore's campaign to re-invent government, the
Interior Dept. last year proposed the transfer of some BLM I&E functions,
as well as the abolishment of the Minerals Management Service. The latter
would have included distribution of MMS royalty functions to states and
transfer of the MMS offshore program to another agency.
   When the so-called MMS ``devolution'' was hastily retracted in the face
of intense criticism, states were caught somewhat flatfooted (IE/FL, 7 Aug,
14).
   LeMay acknowledged some fear now that Interior may repeat the MMS
scenario; what he called a ``whoops, we're sorry'' withdrawal of the
proposal involving the BLM activities.
   ``We put a lot of effort'' into studying the MMS abolishment and how New
Mexico might assume the royalty function on federal lands within its
borders, said LeMay, who noted that state officials felt Interior did not
act in ``a lot of good faith'' in offering and then retracting the MMS
plan. Because MMS is the royalty center for Interior and the BLM I&E issue
is tied to costs and revenues, there may be ``some resurrection of those
arguments'' about MMS and state assumption of royalty duties, LeMay said.
   Wyoming ranks first in revenue on mineral royalties from federal lands,
and New Mexico has the largest number of wells on federal tracts, LeMay
said in explaining the particular interest of the two states in maximizing
efficiency in governing those properties.
   While the administration has suggested the I&E transfer, LeMay said,
``we kind of need to tighten it up'' in terms of how the move would be
accomplished. States want answers regarding potential savings, funding
options and personnel needs, he said. ``Each state may have a little
different viewpoint,'' LeMay noted, but the object is consensus ``so we do
not have five or six of the largest states each proposing something
different.''
   Nevada's representative on the committee said ``conceptually it makes a
lot of sense for states to play a greater role in I&E on public lands
because, for the most part, many of us are either doing it concurrently or
doing that work in some sort of cooperative memorandum of understanding
with BLM right now.''
   Russell Fields, administrator of the Nevada Division of Minerals,
pointed out that his state and BLM have an MOU to reduce duplication and
effort. Were the state to take a larger role, it would have to be
``adequately compensated for work done on federal lands,'' he said.
   Beyond I&E, states may be ``interested in what other oil and gas
functions they rightfully should take on,'' Fields said, such as authority
to issue and maintain leases and collect royalties.
   Nevada would not be interested ``in just becoming the cops for the
feds,'' Fields said. States may be more interested if the government wants
something more than just I&E transfer, Fields said, such as an integrated
program with the goal of more efficient use of resources.
   The I&E Committee session is slated for Jan. 26 in Aurora, Colo. Other
states represented on the panel include Utah, Louisiana, California, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Nebraska.

WILDERNESS SOCIETY FINDS NEW CONGRESS `WORST EVER' ON ENVIRONMENT

Support for bills to open the Arctic National Wildlife coastal plain to oil
and gas development and reform the Endangered Species Act are just two
elements of a grievous environmental record that makes the 104th Congress
the ``worst Congress ever,'' The Wilderness Society has charged in a new
report.
   ``The hard-liners in this Congress make James Watt look timid,''
Wilderness Society President Jon Roush said in releasing the study Dec. 27.
``They have a playbook written by the mining, logging, and ranching
industries, and they're hacking away at everything except the subsidies
enjoyed by those industries.''
   In the report, the Society termed the new Congress ``a worse
environmental accident than the Exxon Valdez,'' and said the ``election of
many zealots whose allegiance is to the extractive industries'' threatens
many of the nation's natural resource treasures.
   The study singled out for criticism the record of some newly powerful
lawmakers, including Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House
Resources Committee, Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, chairman of the House
Resources subcommittee on national parks, forests and lands, Rep. John
Doolittle, R-Calif., chairman of the House Resources subcommittee on water
and power resources, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate
Energy Committee, and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., chairman of the Senate
Appropriations interior subcommittee.
   The leadership changes have placed in power members who have tried for
years to rewrite environmental protection laws, the society warned.
   ``The most threatening aspect of this realignment is that the
development-at-all-costs Alaskan delegation heads both resources
committees,'' the report said. In addition, should Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, replace retiring Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., as chair of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, the Wilderness Society warned that
``[s]enators casting swing votes will be under enormous pressure to go
along with the Alaskan delegation's agenda.''
   Environmental groups have strenuously opposed any oil development in the
1.5-million-acre ANWR coast plain, but the Alaska delegation managed to
include language authorizing ANWR leasing in the budget reconciliation
package that President Clinton vetoed last month. The future of the
provision remained uncertain last week as Congress and the president
continued discussions on the budget and partial government shutdown.
   The GOP-led Congress appears intent on gutting the nation's endangered
species statute, the report added, with major ESA reform bills introduced
by Sens. Gorton (S. 768) and Dirk Kempthorne, R-Idaho, (S. 1364), and Reps.
Young and Richard Pombo, R-Calif., (H.R. 2275).
   While the three bills differ, the report charged they all would allow
some species to go extinct, curtail ESA's protections of species' habitat
on private land, limit protection for subspecies, and require taxpayers to
pay developers not to destroy habitat if protections would diminish the
property value.
   The report also attacked the language in two FY-96 Interior
appropriations bills, both vetoed by the president, that would place a
temporary moratorium on listing of new endangered species and designation
of critical habitat.
   Republican lawmakers' intent to dismantle the National Biological
Service also drew criticism, as The Wilderness Society noted the opposition
of extractive industries and real estate interests to NBS. The service was
created by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt in 1993 to consolidate the
biological science expertise within the department.
   NBS would be eliminated and its functions transferred to the U.S.
Geological Survey under the Interior appropriations measures vetoed by
Clinton.
   In other complaints, the report objected to what it termed ``give-away''
legislation, supported by some GOP lawmakers, that would allow states to
take over Bureau of Land Management lands within their borders. It also
attacked ``takings'' measures passed in the House and by the Senate
Judiciary Committee that would compensate landowners when environmental
protection actions by the government degrades their property values.
   Lifting of the Alaskan oil export ban was folly, the report added. While
Stevens argued for repeal of the ban, saying it forced shipment of Alaskan
crude to West Coast markets where it created a glut and depressed prices,
the report noted the senator, in contrast, ``insists that there is an oil
shortage'' when he advocates drilling of ANWR.
   The Society group noted, overall, ``The most important question as 1995
turns to 1996 is probably how vigilant and outspoken Americans will be'' on
environmental issues. It said polls indicate the ``public is firmly
committed to environmental protection and wants to see more progress rather
than an unraveling of current law.''
   The report, ``The Worst Congress Ever: A Review of the Environmental
Record of the 104th Congress at Mid-point and the Outlook for 1996,'' is
available from The Wilderness Society at (202) 833-2300.

OSM PLANS TO CONDUCT EMERGENCY INSPECTIONS IF FURLOUGH CONTINUES

A limited number of federal inspectors will visit surface mines on federal
and Indian lands on an emergency basis this week if the partial government
shutdown continues, Office of Surface Mining Deputy Director Ed Kay said
Thursday.
   Fewer than 10 OSM inspectors will likely be involved in the effort after
they have been designated essential personnel by agency officials.
   The reason for the special designations is that ``nothing is being
done'' to oversee lands where OSM has the primary inspection function
because of the government closure, Kay said. Partial visits are needed ``to
make sure everything is okay,'' the deputy director added, noting that the
Interior Dept. solicitor has approved such inspections on a limited basis.
   Although primacy states conduct the necessary inspections within their
borders, OSM is responsible for assuring health and safety on lands in
Washington and Tennessee, where it is the primary enforcer, as well as on
Indian lands in New Mexico and Arizona and federal lands in Kentucky.
   At OSM's Western Region Coordinating Center in Denver, processing of 100
Indian and 50 federal permits has stopped, its director, Richard Seibel,
said.
   The federal shutdown may also hamper issuance of permits by states,
which have been unable to use OSM's Applicant Violator System since the
agency closed, Seibel said. States check companies through AVS for
outstanding permit violations before issuing new permits, he noted. Losing
access to AVS may delay the states' issuance of new permits.
   OSM is dealing with emergency situations with a skeleton staff, Kay
said. The fact that most surface-mining crises occur during other parts of
the year, when there is typically more rain, makes coping with the current
situation somewhat easier for the agency, he added.

CONSERVANCY FINDS ONE-THIRD OF NATION'S PLANTS, ANIMALS THREATENED

The Nature Conservancy issued a 1996 species report card last week in which
it warned that the survival of one-third of the nation's plants and animals
is threatened, particularly those species dependent on rivers, lakes and
streams. More than 500 scientists examined more than 20,000 U.S. species.
   The troubles of freshwater aquatic species were attributed to poor water
quality and long-term effects of dams and other water diversions. ``These
figures clearly show that efforts to protect the nation's water quality
will not only benefit people, but also these species,'' said John Sawhill,
president and chief executive of the Nature Conservancy.
   The data compiled in the annual report is used by federal and state
resource managers to decide on land use, and by private businesses and
individuals to design projects that do not harm sensitive species and
habitat, the Conservancy said.
   The Conservancy described the report, ``Priorities for Conservation:
1996 Annual Report Card for U.S. Plant and Animal Species,'' as the ``most
comprehensive assessment to date on the conservation status of U.S.
species.''
   The group found that one species, the Merriam's Bearpaw Poppy, a desert
wildflower, is doing better than thought. The wildflower is more abundant
on a Nevada military base than previously known, it said.
   ``Based on this find by Conservancy botanists, the plant probably will
not need to be listed under the federal Endangered Species Act,'' the group
said.
   The animal groups listed as most at risk were: freshwater mussels,
crayfish, freshwater fish, and amphibians.
   The report was a NatureServe publication, sponsored by Canon U.S.A. Inc.
as part of its Clean Earth Campaign. Information on the report is available
from the Conservancy's Larry Carpman at (703) 841-8740.

THE DEADLINE IS MARCH 7 TO FILE COMMENTS ON SURETY RULES under revision by

THE DEADLINE IS MARCH 7 TO FILE COMMENTS ON SURETY RULES under revision by
the Minerals Management Service. The agency said it is considering creation
of a deadline of two years for all Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas
lessees to bring their bond coverage into compliance with new levels of
coverage established in 1993.
   The proposed regulations would clarify MMS' position that ``assignees,
assignors, and co-lessees are jointly and severally liable for compliance''
with OCS lease requirements. The rules also would establish a framework for
lease-specific abandonment accounts and acceptance of a third-party
guarantee, and would update the bond coverage required for right-of-way
holders and geological and geophysical exploration permittees.
   MMS said the changes were needed in order to ``reduce the risk of
default by an underfunded company operating a lease or holding a
right-of-way.''
   For more information, contact Gerald Rhodes of the MMS engineering and
technology division at (703) 787-1609.

DOE ISSUES FINAL RFP FOR HANFORD WORK

By:
Mary Powers, Birmingham, Ala.

DOE Thursday released a final request for proposals for a five-year
management and integration contract at its Hanford Site that for the first
time includes specific performance objectives and measures.
   The RFP is the latest large site management contract issued under the
agency's two-year-old contract reform initiative and is the first to
include performance objectives specified by DOE. Until now, DOE has relied
on bidders to propose such benchmarks.
   DOE said it will attach incentives to a number of the performance
measures to reward contractors for making progress toward cleanup. The
complete fee structure is open for negotiation, however, and will be
proposed by each bidder. Proposals could include a base fee or could be
100% incentive fee. ``We don't want to discourage any innovative thinking
by bidders,'' said a DOE spokesman. The contract has an estimated value of
$4.6 billion over its five-year duration.
   The language in the final RFP was strengthened from that contained in a
draft RFP released last year to emphasize cost-effective innovative
approaches and to include cost reductions in specific areas, such as
overhead and indirect costs, the agency said. Bidders' past performance as
well as their proposed approach to cost reduction will be weighed during
selection. The RFP specifically outlines an aggressive ``make-or-pay''
program that requires work to be contracted out or privatized if it is more
efficient to do so.
   The contract covers all work at Hanford that is not included in the
environmental restoration management contract now held by Bechtel Hanford
Corp. It includes the cleanup of the waste tanks and spent fuel, as well as
infrastructure management, base operations, construction and construction
management. The statement of work included in the final RFP is organized
around what DOE calls ``Project Hanford,'' an effort to duplicate the best
administrative and management controls found in the private sector.
   Proposals are due March 15. DOE says it will make a final selection in
June, with the winner to take over operations Oct. 1. Three, and possibly
four, companies have lined up teams to bid on the Hanford management and
integration contract.
   California-based Fluor Daniel Inc.. is leading a team that includes
Lockheed-Martin; Rust Federal Services; Babcock and Wilcox; Duke Energy and
Services, Numatec and International Technology Corp. Bechtel Corp., which
has the environmental restoration contract at Hanford now, is leading a
team that includes Westinghouse; BNFL Inc.; Computer Sciences Corp., and
Johnson Controls. A third team led by Boston-based Raytheon Corp. includes
CH2M Hill; ICF Kaiser; Tenneco Boeing Information Services Corp., and
Siemens Power Corp.
   Sources last week said a fourth team may be organizing under TRW Inc.'s
and Parsons Corp.'s lead. None of the three teams are final yet, and the
sources said other companies will be added as the final RFP is examined. A
Bechtel spokesman said its team will include several more pre-selected
subcontractors, but that most of the subcontracted work will be
competitively bid after the contract is awarded.
   The contract out for bid is now held by Westinghouse and ICF Kaiser. At
least one industry source gives Bechtel the best odds at winning. ``It has
the strongest team because it includes two large contract holders there
now,'' the source said. Others, however, argue the opposite, saying that
Bechtel can't win because Westinghouse is on its team. ``That company is
the kiss of death out there,'' he said.
   Meanwhile contractors are waiting for the RFP that will replace EG&G at
DOE's Mound site. DOE has promised a draft will be issued between Jan. 15
and Feb. 8. Sources said a number of teams want to bid on the much smaller
$500 million contract.
   ``We're lucky that these two are coming out close together. The big
players are looking at Hanford, leaving the smaller companies to pursue
Mound,'' one source said. The job will include cleaning up the site and
returning the assets to the City of Miamisburg, Ohio, and is expected to be
valued at $80 to $100 million a year for five years.
   International Technology Corp. is planning to lead a team, while sources
say Fluor Daniel's management team at DOE's nearby Fernald Environmental
Management Project will also bid the job. Other players looking to lead or
join teams include ICF Kaiser, Babcock & Wilcox, Parsons, Morrison Knudsen,
Weston, SAIC, Foster Wheeler, and TRW.
    ``There's lots of mating dances going on here,'' said an industry
source, who along with other company officials are in Ohio planning their
strategy.

BOB ALCOCK HAS BEEN NAMED ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY for congressional,

BOB ALCOCK HAS BEEN NAMED ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY for congressional,
intergovernmental and public affairs at DOE. Alcock, who most recently
worked as deputy assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs,
replaced Carolyn Herr Watts, who left the agency for the private sector
last month.
   The White House has nominated and the Senate Energy Committee has
confirmed Derrick Forrister. a former special assistant to Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary, for the assistant secretary job, but the nomination has been
blocked in the Senate since last summer.
   Alcock worked as former Texas Democratic Rep. Barbara Jordan's
legislative assistant from l1973 to 1979 and, after two years in the
private sector, returned to Congress as chief of staff to California
Democratic Rep. Esteban Torres.
   He was named deputy assistant secretary in February 1994. In that
position, he was responsible for providing liaison between DOE and various
state and local government officials including governors, mayors, state
legislators, county supervisors and tribal leaders.

GAO SAYS SPENDING GAPS TYPICAL FOR DOE

DOE's inability to document $255,000 in expenses it incurred on two trade
missions to India and South Africa are part of a ``systemic''
record-keeping problem at the department that may date back to the
Manhattan Project, an official with the General Accounting Office said
Thursday.
   At a hearing before the House Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations, Victor Rezendes, GAO's director of energy, resources and
science issues, said his office found DOE was unable to provide records for
$80,000 in expenses it claimed for an October 1994 trade mission to India
and $175,000 in charges made during a similar trip to South Africa in
August.
   In both instances, GAO said, the money was paid by U.S. embassies in the
countries for goods and services purchased on behalf of the DOE
delegations.
   Rezendes, whose office looked into the cost of the two trips at the
request of Ohio Republican Rep. Martin Hoke, a critic of Energy Secretary
Hazel O'Leary's overseas travel, told the subcommittee that DOE did not
have written procedures in place during either of the trips specifying what
types of records were to be kept or the process to follow when obtaining
travel support from the State Dept.
   For both trips, Rezendes said, embassies reported charges to DOE that
listed the amounts paid to vendors. ``The lists sometimes, but not always,
provided a brief description of the nature of the charges,'' he said.
   ``DOE's accounting office recorded the charges in DOE's accounts, but
relied on the responsible program office to approve the charges. However,
the program officials did not maintain supporting documents of the expenses
incurred,'' he said. Further, Rezendes said that in some cases, the program
officials ``could not provide an explanation for the embassies' charges.''
   DOE, Rezendes added, could not provide GAO auditors with supporting
documents to ``give assurances of what the money was spent for. This is not
a new problem at DOE and without the documentation, we don't know, nor does
DOE know, what the money was spent on.''
   ``We want to ensure that double billing did not occur, and maybe there
charges are perfectly okay, but the point is we don't know,'' he said.
   Rezendes said the problem of shoddy bookkeeping at DOE precedes O'Leary
and may, in fact, have its origins in the Manhattan Project. ``This goes
back a long time and probably predates DOE, the [Atomic Energy Commission]
and goes back to the Manhattan Project. The United States government, in
its effort to build the atomic bomb, agreed to total cost reimbursement.
Everything was allowable and after the war the same total cost
reimbursement system was retained,'' he said.
   ``Anytime we have looked at DOE with a microscope we have found a lack
of documentation and an understanding of what it is paying for,'' Rezendes
added.
   Questioned by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., Rezendes said his
investigation failed to turn up any evidence of improper or illegal use of
federal funds, but he added that the problem is there is insufficient
documentation available yet to make a conclusive determination.
   Rezendes credited O'Leary for making ``the most aggressive changes'' of
any of her predecessors in the agency's contracting process and said DOE,
working with GAO, is working to develop written procedures that would
require DOE officials traveling abroad to follow specific steps, such as
completing certain documents and vouchers and submitting all required
receipts in support of travel expenses to the agency's accounting office.
``If properly implemented, these procedures should prevent similar problems
from occurring in the future,'' he added.
   The GAO report was critical of DOE's decision to change the source of
funding for security staff accompanying O'Leary on overseas trips from the
agency's administration account to its Defense Programs account. DOE
transferred $400,000 from the DP account to pay for the security costs in
FY-95.
   The decision, Rezendes said, ``is inconsistent with a long-standing
principle of appropriations accounting.'' DOE acted improperly, GAO said,
by using the Defense Programs money to cover the security costs without
first informing Congress.
   Congress has already acted to address the problem, Rezendes said. In the
FY-96 energy and water development appropriations act, Congress directed
that all costs to support the travel of any security detail accompanying
O'Leary are to be paid out of the departmental administration account.
   House Republicans used last week's hearing to reissue a demand that
O'Leary resign.
   Hoke, in an opening statement, said DOE, under O'Leary's leadership,
``has unfortunately become a glaring symbol of government waste.''
   ``Up until now, most of the media focus has been on Secretary O'Leary's
lavish excessive travel -- 100 trips -- which in itself is a serious
problem.
   However, that is just the tip of a mismanagement iceberg that masks the
much larger problem of profound agency chaos, with tens of millions of
dollars in lost computers and other property, hundreds of thousands of
dollars unaccounted for, special perks for special friends, a useless and
stupid waste of $43,000 to rate the friendliness of reporters, editorial
boards, and members of Congress, illegal lobbying, hundreds of full-time
employees devoted to public relations and the secretary's personal
image-building, and countless other examples of waste, fraud and abuse,''
he said.
   House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley, R-Va., joined his
colleagues in condemning O'Leary's travel. ``It is becoming more and more
clear to me that under the current leadership, [DOE] has little respect for
the American taxpayer. The secretary and her entourage of hundreds travel
in luxury at taxpayer's expense throughout the world.
   ``Yet, according to the findings in the GAO report, they don't even care
enough to keep a single, solitary receipt for more than a quarter-million
dollars expended on just these two trips alone. And when they run short of
travel funds, they violate nearly a century's worth of budget principles to
drain other funds to pick up the tab,'' he said.
   Subcommittee Democrats voiced support, arguing that no evidence had been
provided that showed money had been misused and that the problem may be
nothing more than an accounting glitch.
   Dingell, in his opening statement, questioned why the panel had not
asked DOE or State Dept. officials to testify about the trips. ``I hope it
doesn't show that we are more interested in a political hatchet job than we
are in finding the truth,'' he said. State Dept. employees have been
furloughed by the government shutdown.
   DOE said Wednesday that it had received ``summary statements that show
that each expenditure incurred was certified by a State Department
official.'' While DOE said it had not received every voucher to determine
whether it should have paid all of the certified expenses, it expects to
receive those documents when the federal shutdown ends.
   DOE also said it disagreed with GAO's criticism of its decision to pay
for security on foreign trips with $400,000 from Defense Program accounts,
which officials noted have been used for some time for security on domestic
travel. ``We stand by our decision to use the same appropriation account
for security for both foreign and domestic travel,'' DOE said.

O'LEARY ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR AIR OVER IMPACT OF OVERSEAS EXCURSIONS

Exactly how much new business has been gained by U.S. companies by virtue
of DOE's four overseas trade missions was still an open question last
week.
   In a Dec. 28 letter to Congress, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said
company executives who accompanied her on the trips have told the agency
they have completed, or are close to finalizing, $4.3 billion in deals that
could be tied to the missions.
   O'Leary's letter came in response to a Dec. 20 request from the chairmen
of seven House Committees and subcommittees asking the secretary to explain
what they described as apparent multibillion-dollar discrepancies in the
economic benefits she said companies have gained from her overseas travel
(IE/FL, 25 Dec, 1).
   At various times, O'Leary has claimed the trips have resulted in as much
as $27.7 billion and as little as $2.4 billion in new business for U.S.
companies.
   At a hearing last week before the House Commerce subcommittee on
oversight and investigations, however, Ohio Republican Rep. Martin Hoke
said his own survey of company officials put the value of the trips at
about $1.4 billion. Hoke suggested, moreover, that even that figure may be
generous.
   Hoke, who has been a harsh critic of O'Leary's travel, said the
secretary's trade missions are the product of an agency undergoing a
``bureaucratic midlife crisis, desperately pretending to be something it is
not in an attempt to find a new purpose to justify its continued
existence.''
   O'Leary, he continued, ``often acts more like the head of a state
chamber of commerce trade delegation ... than a member of the president's
Cabinet charged with the profoundly important, if somewhat dull,
responsibility of safeguarding the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile.''
   Just how much new business the trade missions have returned to U.S.
companies is important to determining how effective the trips have been,
Hoke said.
   The congressman said O'Leary originally claimed that the trade missions
to India, Pakistan, China and South Africa resulted in $19.7 billion worth
of contracts for U.S. companies. Recently, however, in response to a
newspaper inquiry, DOE said $2.4 billion in deals had been signed. On Dec.
19, the agency revised the figure to $4.3 billion.
   Hoke said he believes the actual number is probably closer to $1.4
billion. Even that number is ``guesswork,'' Hoke said, adding that most of
the contracts were won by large U.S. companies with strong international
representation. They were capable, he said, of securing the contracts
without DOE's help.
   In her letter to Congress, O'Leary attempted to clear the air. In
testimony she delivered to the Senate in March, O'Leary estimated that
energy-related business agreements advanced during DOE and Commerce
Dept.-sponsored trade missions had a combined potential and realized value
of $27.7 billion.
   A later estimate of $19.7 billion represents realized and potential
agreements of energy-related deals that have come out of DOE trade
missions. They include, she said, ``memoranda of intent or understanding
 ... , power purchase agreements, fuel supply agreements and other steps
necessary to advance business deals. The $19.7 billion estimate represents
the total potential value of the deals advanced by the trade missions that
I headed and is an important guidepost for tracking the long-term success
of the missions.''
   As for the $4.3 billion figure, O'Leary said that represents the number
of deals that have been completed. The $2.4 billion estimate DOE gave
earlier this year in response to an inquiry from the Los Angeles Times did
not include several deals companies later reported as completed.
   In her letter, O'Leary told members that while the trade missions have
provided U.S. companies with new contracts and have created American jobs,
business deals are not the only benefits that have accrued.
   DOE trade missions ``help shape policies that support the success of
U.S. competitiveness, democratization and market economies,'' she said.
   ``Our missions have encouraged countries to create the necessary legal,
financial, and regulatory policies that are the cornerstone of market
economies, while also enabling projects with U.S. energy companies to reach
closure. ... Every nation in which we have conducted trade missions has
further endorsed market reforms in the energy sector, and I believe our
work has greatly contributed to that progress.''
   The trips have also helped create a ``level playing field'' for U.S.
business, O'Leary said. U.S. businesses have asked for DOE's help and
Congress has given DOE the authority to provide assistance, ``because these
markets are important to their future and because foreign competitors enjoy
strong support from their governments.''
   O'Leary said DOE will continue to track the progress of the dollar-value
of the trade missions, but warned that because the emerging markets
involved in the trade missions have little experience in competitive
markets, the final dollar figure for successful projects advanced during
the trips may not be known for five to 10 years.

E. SHIRLEY THOMAS, DOE OMBUDSMAN AND FRIEND OF SECRETARY HAZEL O'LEARY, has
been notified she will have to repay between $20,000 and $25,000 she has
received as a living allowance for nearly two years, but for which she was
ineligible.
   A department spokeswoman said Thomas was informed by the agency's Office
of General Counsel that she will have to pay back a $35 per day allowance
she had received as an allowance for maintaining her principal residence in
Newark, where she was employed as a social worker before being tapped by
O'Leary for the $93,000-a-year DOE post. In fact, Thomas moved to the
Washington area in December 1993.
   DOE spokeswoman Barbara Semedo said Thomas was said to be ``eager'' to
repay the funds. Thomas could not be reached for comment.
   O'Leary in November defended Thomas against charges from House
Republicans that her job is unnecessary and that she was appointed to the
post chiefly because of their longtime friendship.

BUDGET CUT FORCES LAYOFF OF PART-TIME AND STUDENT WORKERS AT DOE

Although a DOE plan to meet congressional cuts in the agency's
administration budget spared full-time employees from layoffs, 32 part-time
workers and student interns were not as lucky.
   DOE last week said it will lay off nine part-time workers, eight of whom
were employed in the agency's mailroom, and 23 college and high school
students, to help it comply with a congressional directive that it cut
administrative staff by 15% this year.
   In its FY-96 energy and water development appropriations bill, Congress
reduced funding for DOE's administration $41 million below what the
department had sought. In report language accompanying the bill, the
lawmakers said the funding level assumed a 15% cut in DOE's workforce.
   The administration budget pays the salaries and other operating expenses
for about 2,900 employees in non-program offices, including human
resources, the office of congressional and public affairs, policy field
management and the Idaho, Oak Ridge and Chicago field offices.
   DOE managers and union representatives signed off on a plan shortly
before Christmas that would comply with the congressional requirement yet
spare forced layoffs through such actions as increasing the number of
workers opting for early retirement, eliminating overtime spending and
performance bonuses, continuing a hiring freeze and furloughing each
employee for at least 48 hours spread out over the current fiscal year
(IE/FL, 25 Dec, 12).
   The plan, however, does call for some forced reductions. A DOE official
last week said 32 workers will be laid off. Under the plan, the nine
temporary employees will be dismissed from the agency on or before Jan.
26.
   Twenty-three student employees -- including college students working in
the department's cooperative education program and high school students
employed under the agency's ``Stay in School'' program -- will get their
walking papers.
   Under the cooperative education program, DOE gives college students the
opportunity to gain professional experience while they work toward their
degrees. Upon graduation, the students have the opportunity to move into
full-time permanent positions at the agency.
   The Stay in School program involves clerical work largely for high
school students, whose financial situation may otherwise force them to drop
out before matriculating.
   Eligibility for both programs is based on financial need. Students in
both programs will be asked to leave their jobs by April 19, the official
said.
   Department-wide, DOE will retain 40 college students in the cooperative
education program and six under the Stay in School program, the official
said. In addition, officials are hoping that some of the 23 students will
be picked up by DOE program offices that are not facing the same salary
restrictions as is the department administration account.

ERVIN SAYS DIVISION WILL CUT STAFF BY ONE-THIRD OVER NEXT FIVE YEARS

By:
Lira Behrens

As part of its effort to comply with DOE's Strategic Alignment Initiative,
DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy division is aiming to cut
staff by a third and reduce administrative costs by 50% over the next five
years.
   EERE Assistant Secretary Christine Ervin told reporters in a briefing
Thursday that it was unclear where the cuts would be made, but two-thirds
of them would likely be made in the first two years. Many of the cuts also
will come from closing four of the 10 EERE Regional Support Offices that
was announced in August.
   The administrative improvements will come from a new computerized
personnel center the division hopes to unveil in February, as well as a
partnership with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which Ervin said
has ``its own aggressive program to reduce administrative costs.'' A team
of EERE employees has already identified 67 processes where ``there might
be major savings,'' she said.
   Ervin described the restructuring of the division as ``not a dramatic
reorganization, but a natural evolution.''
  One major effect of the change, Ervin said, would be to decrease the
ratio of managers to staff within the division from 1:5 to 1:15. Doing so,
she said, would ``push decisionmaking down in the organization, giving more
authority to the staff.''
   The other major change effected by the reorganization is what she termed
``graduation day'' for the division's Office of Technical and Financial
Assistance. The office, which deals primarily with state and local
assistance programs, has previously been in a ``separate box,'' which she
said had been an obstacle to deployment of EERE's r&d programs.
   Under the new organization, OTFA's Weatherization Assistance Program and
State Energy Conservation Program grants would be housed with the
division's building energy programs under a new Office of Building Systems
and State and Community Programs. Mary Fowler, who had been OTFA's acting
deputy assistant secretary, is now the associate deputy assistant secretary
for the new office.
   Ervin said the lack of an Interior appropriations bill (which funds the
division's efficiency programs) has not required employee furloughs or
cutbacks in grants because the department has money left over from FY-95
and so-called ``no-year money.'' According to Ervin's Chief of Staff Brian
Castelli, the programs could operate ``a few more months'' on the outyear
funding.
   One program Ervin said has been delayed by the government shutdown is
the implementation of an agreement reached in early December with the
Environmental Protection Agency to consolidate the two agencies' appliance
efficiency labeling programs. EPA, whose funding bill has not been
approved, has an ``energy star'' program that labels computers and other
appliances as energy efficient, while DOE is responsible for setting energy
efficiency standards for appliances.
   According to Ervin, DOE and EPA have worked with retailers such as
Circuit City, Sears and Home Depot on what the new labels should look like.
The department had hoped to complete the label consolidation by the end of
the year, but has been unable to meet with EPA because the agency's
employees are furloughed.
   In other programs, Ervin said the department plans to issue final
guidelines for Home Energy Rating Systems by January 31. The department has
asked the Home Energy Ratings Systems Council and several state-run HERS
programs known as the Residential Energy Services Network, to resolve their
differences on technical issues related to the guidelines before then.
   Members of the HERS Council, which submitted recommended guidelines to
DOE in October 1994, late last year expressed concern that the disagreement
threatened the program (IE/FL, 30 Oct, 7). The groups have now apparently
narrowed the list of issues over which they disagree and have tentatively
scheduled a series of meetings for mid-January.

HOUSE BID TO OVERRIDE CLINTON VETO OF INTERIOR SPENDING BILL FAILS

House Republicans failed to override President Clinton's veto of the
Interior appropriations bill Thursday, garnering only 239 of the 278 votes
needed to pass the bill over Clinton's objections.
   Among the reasons the president said he vetoed the bill (H.R. 1977) was
that it did not contain enough funding for DOE's energy efficiency programs
(IE/FL, 25 Dec, 4). According to administration sources, the bill's future
will likely hinge on the White House's negotiations with Congress on the
overall budget agreement.
   Sources familiar with the negotiations last week said advocates of the
efficiency programs in the White House were asking for $75 million in
additional FY-96 funding to be split between three efficiency programs: the
Weatherization Assistance Program, the Partnership for a new Generation of
Vehicles program, and the programs aimed at implementing the
administration's Climate Change Action Plan.
   A congressional aide, however, denied that the overall budget
negotiations would affect the FY-96 Interior appropriations bill. The aide
said it was unclear what appropriators would do with the interior bill. The
two options, she said, were to either move another stand-alone bill, or
roll funding for the programs into a long-term continuing resolution.
   The FY-97 budget request process is apparently on hold until the FY-96
budget levels are settled. DOE has submitted a budget request to the Office
of Management and Budget of $915 million for EERE, but it was unclear at
press time how that may have been changed during the ``passback'' process.
   Of the outlook for FY-97 funding for her programs, DOE Assistant
Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Christine Ervin told
reporters last week that ``a lot of it is hinging on the negotiations for
FY-96.''
   While she would not divulge details of the FY-97 request until it has
been submitted to Congress by the president, Ervin said the ``historic
percentage increases [in efficiency and renewable energy programs] in past
years are not likely to continue. We do know that energy efficiency and
renewable energy remain a high priority for the secretary and the
administration.'' And she added there will be ``some decent continuations
for programs.''

DOE WILL PROVIDE $100,000 TO JAMES E. RUSSELL PETROLEUM INC., to improve a

DOE WILL PROVIDE $100,000 TO JAMES E. RUSSELL PETROLEUM INC., to improve a
new process to clean water used in oil field operations.
   The ``air flotation process'' emerged from an earlier DOE co-sponsored
project with Russell Petroleum and the University of Kansas. Russell
Petroleum, Abilene, Texas, will contribute $102,000 of its own to continue
research on the project. DOE's award will be made through the National
Institute for Petroleum Energy Research in Bartlesville, Okla.
   According to DOE, water produced with oil is often reinjected into the
reservoir to increase the efficiency of the oil recovery operation. But
impurities in the water can plug the tiny pores in the reservoir rock,
often blocking the water from reaching the target zones.
   In the air flotation process, air is bubbled through a flotation column.
Waste impurities cling to the air bubbles and are removed from the water.
The technique, a modification of a process originally developed to clean
coal and other minerals, has been used in some offshore oil operations. It
was unclear, however, whether the process would be cost-effective for
onshore oil fields, particularly those operated by smaller, independent
producers.
   According to the department, the original Russell Petroleum project
showed that the air flotation device may make economic sense for many
independent producers. The company credits the technology with contributing
to the recovery of some 300,000 barrels of oil that otherwise would have
been left in the ground.
   Under the second phase of the project, which will last 18 months,
Russell Petroleum will develop screening criteria to help other producers
determine where and when the process can be applied; develop optimum design
and operating guidelines for the technology; determine the cost of
implementing critical design improvements; and communicate the correct
method of applying the technology and its benefits to other operators.
   The original project was funded under DOE's Reservoir Class Field
Demonstration Program, which is aimed at demonstrating ways that oil
producers can avoid prematurely abandoning their wells. The Russell
Petroleum follow-on project is the result of a solicitation DOE issued to
the 33 participants in the ``near-term'' category of the program. The
department has recently requested proposals for follow-on projects from
participants in ``mid-term'' and other categories of the program.

THE NUCLEAR ENERGY INSTITUTE MISTAKENLY LISTED A CONSUMER GROUP among

THE NUCLEAR ENERGY INSTITUTE MISTAKENLY LISTED A CONSUMER GROUP among
supporters of a bill aimed at fixing DOE's high-level nuclear waste
program.
   In an ad NEI placed in the Dec. 12, 13 and 14 Washington editionS of the
Los Angeles Times, the industry group included the Consumer Federation of
America in a list of organizations it said support the bill (H.R. 1020). In
a letter to the paper's editor, CFA Executive Director Stephen Brobeck said
the group did not approve the use of its name in the ad and that it has no
position on the bill.
   Brobeck, who asked the paper to print a correction, said NEI ``has
admitted their error and apologized to us.''
   The ad was brought to the attention of CFA by several state Public
Interest Research Groups, who are members of the federation, and who oppose
the bill.
   U.S. PIRG said the incident ``is just one more example of the brazen
excess the nuclear industry uses to ram a destructive bill through
Congress.''
   An NEI spokeswoman Friday acknowledged the group made a mistake in
including CFA among those groups endorsing the bill. She, however, said CFA
was included because the group had passed a resolution urging Congress to
ensure that money paid by consumers into the nuclear waste fund was used
for the program. That provision, she added, is a key part of the
legislation.
   The spokeswoman criticized PIRG, saying the group was allowing its
``anti-nuclear views to get in the way of protecting consumers.''

EEI PRESIDENT THOMAS KUHN WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF CONGRESS waits until

EEI PRESIDENT THOMAS KUHN WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF CONGRESS waits until
the end of the session to decide on nuclear waste legislation. That's when
the first two laws addressing the topic passed in 1982 and 1987, Kuhn said
during a briefing last week for the Washington International Energy Group,
and he suggested that history may repeat itself this year.
   Nevertheless, the Edison Electric Institute chief said a bill reported
overwhelmingly by the House Commerce Committee in August could be the start
of a new law this year. He said he thought the measure (H.R. 1020), which
would require DOE to open an interim site for nuclear waste in Nevada by
1998, may pass the House handily if it gets to the floor. That, he added,
would ``motivate'' the Senate to respond similarly.
   ``Hopefully, the issue is important enough that it will percolate up and
be finished this year,'' Kuhn said of a nuclear waste bill. ``There is a
critical need for it.''
   Kuhn was less sanguine that Congress will reconsider proposals to sell
DOE's power marketing administrations, which EEI supported in 1995, but
which failed because of opposition in the regions where the PMAs operate.
He credited the public power and rural cooperative portions of the electric
utility sector for their successful fight against the proposals.
   ``I don't really believe there will be a very active discussion of the
issue this year, but I do believe it will be back in the next Congress,''
Kuhn said of the PMAs. The fact that the PMAs operate with a federal
``subsidy'' will draw more scrutiny as the notion of competition in the
overall utility sector gains support nationally, he added.
   While EEI wants lawmakers' help on nuclear waste and the PMAs, the group
would prefer that they abstain from addressing retail wheeling or
competition in the utility industry, he said. Kuhn acknowledged that
proposals by House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley Jr., R-Va.,
and other lawmakers that address those issues likely will be discussed
further this year, but he said he hoped nothing would come of them.
   ``We very strongly feel we don't need federally mandated wheeling,'' he
said. ``We don't need a federal solution regarding competition.'' According
to Kuhn, utilities in conjunction with state regulators and other interests
are likely to find solutions to problems related to competition that will
be better than any prescriptions from Washington.

A PANEL CHAIRED BY DOE AND EPA HAVE SELECTED EIGHT PROJECTS involving four

A PANEL CHAIRED BY DOE AND EPA HAVE SELECTED EIGHT PROJECTS involving four
countries and 13 U.S. companies under the second round of the U.S.
Initiative on Joint Implementation.
   The pilot program encourages partnerships between U.S. companies and
developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to DOE,
the program ``spurs technology cooperation by increasing the access of
developing countries to energy-efficiency and renewable energy
technologies. Industrialized countries benefit through the expansion of
export markets.''
   Should a greenhouse gas control program be implemented in the future,
U.S. companies hope they would be able to get credit for reducing emissions
overseas, where such reduction measures are cheaper to implement.
   The projects announced last week, which are financed by the private
sector, will employ geothermal, biomass, hydroelectric and wind energy
technologies, as well as forest management practices in Costa Rica,
Honduras, Nicaragua and Russia.
   Five of the eight projects -- selected from 21 proposals submitted --
are located in Costa Rica. At a ceremony announcing the selected projects
last month, DOE Deputy Energy Secretary Charles Curtis attributed the
number of projects in Costa Rica to its president, Jose Maria Figueres, who
has created a special office of joint implementation and has vowed to
``make Costa Rica a showplace'' for such projects.
   Curtis said Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has ``worked hard to gain
greater acceptance'' of joint implementation projects. The first round of
seven projects were selected in February 1995.
   The projects announced last week are: a forestry project in Costa Rica
involving U.S. partner Newton Treviso Corp.; a geothermal project in
Nicaragua, with Trans-Pacific Geothermal Corp.; a biomass generation
project in Honduras with U.S. participants Nations Energy, a subsidiary of
Tucson Electric, the Edison Electric Institute and Add on Energy 1; a
hydroelectric project in Costa Rica with New World Power Corp.; a windfarm
in Costa Rica with New World Power Corp.; a wind facility in Costa Rica
with Power Systems Inc. and EnergyWorks; a forest restoration project in
Costa Rica with the Nature Conservancy; and a fugitive gas capture project
in Russia with Oregon State University, Sustainable Development Technology
Corp., Sealweld Corp., and EPA.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS CLAIM DOE IS `BACKSLIDING' ON REPROCESSING POLICY

By:
David Kramer

Environmental groups charged last week that DOE is ``backsliding'' on a
20-year-old U.S. commitment to end reprocessing activities by pursuing a
plan to use chemical separations ``canyons'' to treat spent fuel and other
nuclear materials at the Savannah River Site.
   Led by the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, which
released a report on the issue Thursday, the groups claimed that by
generating additional waste, reprocessing will cause more environmental
problems than it solves and will undermine the credibility of U.S. efforts
to convince other nations such as North Korea, India and Russia to end
their reprocessing activities.
   ``How is the United States going to convince these countries and others
to halt reprocessing if we're plunging into it ourselves?'' asked IEER
researcher Noah Sachs, author of the report: ``Risky Relapse into
Reprocessing.'' Though DOE has pledged not to use the plutonium or highly
enriched uranium separated through reprocessing for weapons, other
countries will not be able to verify this, he noted.
   ``It creates a kind of reprocessing double standard,'' Sachs said,
adding that other nations will be unable to verify DOE's pledge not to use
the fissile materials that are separated through reprocessing for nuclear
weapons.
   After exhaustive environmental analyses, DOE has elected to reprocess
much of the spent fuel and solutions containing fissile materials at SRS to
stabilize the material for long-term storage. Moreover, a number of
influential Republican lawmakers, notably Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee, have consistently advocated
reprocessing as a solution to spent fuel management problems at SRS and
other DOE sites.
   But the environmental groups, which also included the Energy Research
Foundation, an SRS watchdog organization, and Snake River Alliance, a
grass-roots group located near the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,
argued that DOE should instead place the spent fuel into dry storage until
technical solutions to problems facing long-term disposition have been
resolved.
   Beatrice Brailsford, executive director of SRA, also criticized DOE's
continuing support at INEL of experimental technology known as
electrometallurgical processing, calling it a ``back door flirtation with
reprocessing.'' The technology ``poses a peril to nonproliferation goals,''
she said, and also fails to respond to any clear need.
   ``DOE's bad interim storage policy is being driven by a bad long-term
storage policy,'' said Arjun Makhijani, IEER president. DOE should start
from scratch in its efforts to find a high-level waste repository, he said,
and abandon its trouble-plagued effort to characterize the Yucca Mountain,
Nev., site. In so doing, the agency ought to resurrect its deep seabed
disposal research program, which was terminated when Congress ordered the
agency to focus all its efforts on the Nevada site.
   DOE need not rush into a repository, Makhijani maintained, since interim
dry storage for a period of up to 100 years would permit the decay of most
of the highly radioactive and heat-generating fission products such as
strontium and cesium. That in turn would eliminate many of the technical
design concerns that face the Yucca Mountain project.
   IEER also rejected reprocessing advocates' contention that DOE spent
fuel, which unlike commercial fuel is in metal form, must be stabilized
prior to its permanent storage. Alternatives to reprocessing could be
developed over the next few decades, or special containers might be
designed specifically for the DOE material, they said.
   ``There is no spent fuel management option that is without risks,''
Sachs said, ``but DOE's own data show that the storage option poses far
fewer risks than reprocessing.''
   According to Sachs, DOE data show that the radiation dose to the
population surrounding SRS during reprocessing activities would be four to
five million times higher than from continued storage of the material
there. DOE estimates in the report indicate an exposure level of 15
person-rem per year via air pathways, and a further 2.2 person-rem per year
via water pathways to the population within 50 miles of SRS.
   DOE's current reprocessing plans will add three million gallons of
high-level liquid radioactive wastes to the tanks at SRS, increasing the
total volume of those wastes by around 10%, according to the report.

REPORT BY SRS CONTRACTOR APPEARS TO ADVOCATE REPROCESSING AT SITE

By:
David Kramer

The operator of DOE's Savannah River Site prepared a report for a local
congressman that suggests reprocessing of spent commercial nuclear fuel at
the facility to prepare the material for permanent disposal.
   An internal report by Westinghouse Savannah River Co., the management
and operating contractor, said reprocessing the nation's commercial spent
fuel for disposal in a permanent repository could be accomplished at SRS
for as much as ``several billion dollars'' less than it will cost to
dispose of it directly in a repository, as the current plan calls for.
Moreover, Westinghouse said, reprocessing would ``increase the technical
assuredness of the spent fuel management program, and potentially could
yield recyclable uranium feedstock.''
   The report, which was prepared in August, was made public by the Energy
Research Foundation, an SRS watchdog environmental group, last week. A DOE
spokesman at Savannah River said the report was requested by Rep. Charles
Norwood, R-Ga., and took about a week to complete. He added that DOE had
not sought the study.
   ERF Director Brian Costner expressed outrage at the report, calling its
cost estimates ``absolutely absurd.'' They do not include any expenses to
upgrade the two 40-year-old reprocessing ``canyons,'' he said. Further, he
added, they fail to account for additional wastes that would be generated
by reprocessing and do not consider ongoing problems with SRS' Defense
Waste Processing Facility, which would be used to vitrify the high-level
wastes that are separated from the spent fuel.
   According to the report, DOE could dispose of the current inventory of
commercial spent nuclear fuel for about $8 billion, including the estimated
repository fees for the canisters that contain the vitrified waste. While a
final repository would still be required, the cost and technical
uncertainty would be cut significantly by the 20-fold volume reduction that
would be achieved through reprocessing, as well as the conversion of the
waste to a single form containing only short-lived non-fissile fission
products, the paper said.
   Reprocessing opponents point out that the procedure would result in a
huge volume of low-level waste that Westinghouse proposes to form into a
concrete-like ``saltstone'' for storage. The report argues that the
saltstone is ``a non-hazardous, non-regulated waste form which has no
environmental impact,'' a characterization disputed by Costner.
   Costner also charged that SRS was ``toying with U.S. nonproliferation
policy,'' and ``trying to redefine reprocessing without a clear open
debate.''
   The Clinton administration generally opposes reprocessing on the grounds
that it encourages proliferation of nuclear weapons-usable materials. DOE,
however, plans to resume reprocessing activities at SRS in order to
stabilize some of its spent fuel and other nuclear materials left over from
weapons production (related story above).
   The administration has been especially adamant in opposing the
reprocessing of commercial spent fuel, however, and has never considered it
as an alternative for civilian spent fuel disposal.
   However, a number of Republican congressmen and senators, particularly
those in the region surrounding SRS, have advocated reprocessing. Norwood
and Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
are two such proponents.
   The report said SRS has documented that the canyons can operate until
2015 ``with normal capital upgrades.'' SRS, said the report, ``has the
immediate capability to assist the DOE and the nuclear power industry in
addressing the nation's spent fuel crisis by beginning the immediate
receipt of commercial spent fuels.''
   The DOE spokesman said Norwood's request came after Senate Energy
Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, proposed using SRS and DOE's
Hanford Site in Washington as interim storage facilities for commercial
spent fuel. ``We get a lot of requests from our congressional delegation
and we respond to them,'' he said.
   The Westinghouse report, however, was well-detailed and appeared to be
written with a pro-reprocessing slant. For example, it indicates that the
direct disposal route for spent fuel is fraught with technical
uncertainties, commenting, ``this uncertainty has not provided the public
with any confidence that the DOE can successfully manage spent fuels.'' By
contrast, the reprocessing route ``offers a technologically proven,
cost-effective solution to the spent fuel disposal problem,'' it said.
   The report also examined the feasibility of reprocessing spent fuel from
other DOE facilities -- the Hanford Site and the Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory. It concluded that the cost of disposing of DOE's Naval Reactor
spent fuels could be cut by nearly two-thirds, to $5 billion, compared to
$14 billion for direct disposal. The cost of disposing of DOE's stainless
steel and zirconium-clad spent fuels could be cut to around $700 million,
from $1.2 billion, it said.

SAIC EXECUTIVE ALM NOMINATED AS DOE'S ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP CHIEF

In an action widely expected for months, the White House Dec. 27 nominated
Science Applications International Corp.'s Alvin Alm to take over DOE's
environmental cleanup program. Alm, a director and senior vice president
for SAIC's Environmental Business Area, will replace Thomas Grumbly as
assistant secretary for environmental management at DOE if he is confirmed
by the Senate.
   President Clinton Dec. 20 nominated Grumbly as DOE under secretary, the
third most senior position at the agency (IE/FL, 25 Dec, 10).
   Prior to joining SAIC in 1989, Alm was the chief executive of Alliance
Technologies Corp. and served as the board chairman and chief executive of
Thermal Analytical Corp. From 1983 to 1985 he was the deputy administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   In 1970, ALM served as the first staff director of the newly created
White House Council on Environmental Quality and in 1973 became EPA's
assistant administrator for planning and management, a position with
responsibilities for strategic planning, budgeting, policy and internal
management.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Alm's new position would mark his second
stint at DOE. In 1977, he joined the agency as assistant secretary for
policy and evaluation. Alm now serves as co-chairman of DOE's Environmental
Management Advisory Board and is on the board of the Energy and
Environmental Policy Institute and the Environmental Export Council.
   Alm will inherit from Grumbly a roughly $6-billion-a-year program that
has come under increasing pressure in Congress and the administration to
reduce its costs. Although it largely escaped deep spending cuts proposed
by the House last year, the program is certain to come under still more
scrutiny from congressional budget cutters this year. In addition, Energy
Secretary Hazel O'Leary is moving ahead with a promise she made early last
year to reduce the program's costs by more than $4 billion over the next
five years.
   Just how quickly the Senate will act on the two nominations is an open
question. An aide to the Senate Energy Committee last week said Grumbly has
a good reputation among committee members and should have little difficulty
winning confirmation. Less is known about Alm, he said, but there is little
reason to believe he will prove controversial.
   Although Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, prefers to move
quickly on nominations, the aide said it could be several months before the
committee and Senate take action, largely because the Senate has been
operating for several weeks without a full contingent and may do so for
sometime longer.

EM DIVISION TELLS CONGRESS OF ITS PLAN FOR COPING WITH BUDGET CUTS

DOE's Environmental Management division last week told lawmakers how it
plans to allocate the $476 million in cuts Congress made to its FY-96
budget.
   In letters sent to about 100 senators and representatives, Thomas
Grumbly, the assistant secretary for environmental management, said EM has
slashed its headquarters costs by 37%, to $222 million, in response to
directives contained in the conference report accompanying the FY-96 Energy
and Water Development Appropriations Act. It also used prior-year balances
as much as possible, also as directed by the appropriators, and accelerated
cleanup activities to reduce long-term costs both at the Fernald
Environmental Management Project and the Rocky Flats Environmental
Technology Site, he added.
   Congress appropriated 7.3% less than DOE's amended budget request for EM
this year -- providing just over $6 billion. But lawmakers earmarked $135
million in EM expenditures, further reducing the amount available to
allocate among the DOE cleanup sites.
   ``The bottom line for most sites is that in virtually all cases the
field office budget reductions were less than 10 percent,'' Grumbly wrote
in the Jan. 2 letters. Reductions at each site were made after consulting
with and reaching agreement among all the field managers, he said.
   Grumbly said the actual percentage cuts among all the sites varied for
three reasons. First, the level of prior-year balances varied among the
sites, and reducing these was one of the goals set by Congress. Second, DOE
sought to maximize the level of compliance at the sites with regulatory and
other requirements, which also vary. And finally, the congressional
earmarks required the department to add funding to certain sites for
specific projects.
   A direct comparison between FY-95 and FY-96 funding levels for each site
as a percentage of the EM budget is not possible due to the increase in
responsibilities of the EM progam in FY-96, he said. These new duties
include site management at the Savannah River Site, Mound Plant and
Pinellas Plant, as well as additional nuclear materials management
activities across the complex.
   Among DOE's largest cleanup operations, funding for the Hanford Site is
being cut 6.3%, to $1.3 billion, while the Savannah River Site's budget
will decline 8.6%, to $1.2 billion. Funding for the Oak Ridge Reservation
will fall by 9.2%, to $782 million, while that for Rocky Flats will decline
by 8.7%, to $573 million. The Ohio Field Office, which funds cleanup both
at Fernald and Mound, will decline by 3.5%, to $509 million, and Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory's budget will fall by 7.2%, to $471
million.
   Funding for Albuquerque Operations, which funds cleanup projects at two
DOE weapons labs as well as operation of the Waste Isolation Pilot Project,
will decline 4.5%, to $608 million, according to the letter.
   In a letter to Washington Republican Sen. Slade Gorton, Grumbly warned
that additional job reductions beyond the 4,800 that have already been
announced by DOE for the Hanford Site are likely. He added that a precise
tally of cuts was not possible at this time.
   Congressional earmarks included a $50 million increase to the budget
request for EM's technology development program to provide funds to be
managed by DOE's Office of Energy Research to develop a research program
that uses the national laboratories and universities; a $25 supplement to
the technology development account for electrometallurgical r&d; $59
million for the maintenance of funding levels at the Morgantown Energy
Technology Center to fund contracts associated with private sector
involvement in developing improved technologies that address needs of the
technology development ``focus areas'' and crosscutting programs; and $1
million in additional funds to the Western Environment Technology Office in
Butte, Mont., to meet EM's commitment to maintain funding level required to
accomplish previously initiated activities.

A SWAP OF WASTE OIL FROM TVA TO DOE SAVED TAXPAYERS $100,000, according to

A SWAP OF WASTE OIL FROM TVA TO DOE SAVED TAXPAYERS $100,000, according to
DOE. While trying to dispose of 75,000 gallons of mineral oil that was
slightly contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, officials at the
Tennessee Valley Authority found that DOE could use the material at its Oak
Ridge K-25 Site.
   The oil is now being used as a first step in cleaning out three large
storage tanks that previously held liquids containing much higher levels of
PCBs. Flushing the 22,500-gallon tanks with oil is a standard initial step
in removing PCBs from the tank walls.
   According to Vince Adams, the DOE manager of the site's Toxic Substance
Control Act Incinerator, where the storage tanks are located, the
department would have purchased commercial fuel oil, at a cost of about
$80,000, to do the job, if not for TVA's offer. TVA estimates it saved
$20,000 in disposal costs by finding a user for it.
   The oil eventually will be burned in the incinerator, which was built in
part to destroy PCB-contaminated liquid wastes.
