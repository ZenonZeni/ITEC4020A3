BMDO director's update BMDO focused on the road to the 
future  

     Editor's Note: On the occasion of BMD Monitor's 10th 
anniversary, the editor asked BMDO director, Lt. Gen. 
Malcolm O'Neill to write a guest column. He graciously 
agreed.
     Looking back a decade ago in the Strategic Defense 
Initiative Organization, O'Neill was deputy for Programs 
and Systems under the first SDIO Director, Lt. Gen. James 
Abrahamson. 
     Before his appointment as BMDO director in May 1993, 
O'Neill also served as SDIO, deputy director, and BMDO 
acting director.
     On behalf of the men and women of the Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization (BMDO) I would like to offer 
congratulations to the BMD Monitor on the occasion of its 
10th anniversary. Since its inception, BMD Monitor has 
provided its readers -- including myself -- with a host of 
useful information regarding BMD programs and policies. I 
wish you continued success.
     Ballistic missile defense programs have evolved and 
changed quite a bit since the first edition of BMD Monitor 
hit the street 10 years ago, [SDI Monitor, March 1986 -Ed.]  
but the basic philosophy has never strayed off course -- the 
development and deployment of systems necessary to 
protect against ballistic missile attack. 
     Ten years ago, we faced the threat posed by the very large 
strategic missile force deployed by the Soviet Union. Now, 
the Soviet Union no longer exists. Unfortunately, this threat 
was rapidly replaced by the continued proliferation of tactical 
ballistic missiles to other countries, some of whom are 
potentially hostile to the United States. These short range 
missiles -- as we saw during the Gulf War -- have become a 
very dangerous threat to our forces deployed abroad, and 
also to our friends and allies.
     The recently completed BMD Program Review, 
conducted by Paul Kaminski, the undersecretary of Defense 
for Acquisition and Technology, established specific 
guidance for the BMD program over the next several years 
and reaffirmed the Defense Department's fundamental 
priorities for missile defense. The first priority remains 
defense against theater ballistic missiles, a threat which is 
here and now. The next priority is to develop the capability 
that can be rapidly deployed to defend against missiles with 
the range to threaten the U.S. homeland. Finally, we will 
continue to develop a technology base to support both 
Theater Missile Defense (TMD) and National Missile 
Defense (NMD) as well as other advanced capabilities to 
round out the BMD Program.
     We are putting "rubber on the ramp" today, and will 
continue to do so in the future. With the continued fielding 
of the PATRIOT Advanced Capability (PAC) Guidance 
Enhanced Missile (GEM) system and an upgraded HAWK 
system to operational units this fiscal year, we will see a real 
improvement in our capability -- at a modest investment -- 
to defend against the short range ballistic missile threat 
exhibited by the SCUD and similar missiles.
     Just as importantly, we have deployed significant 
improvements to our ability to provide early warning 
information to U.S. forces overseas in the event of hostile 
missile launches directed against them. Last year, the Air 
Force activated the Attack and Launch Early Reporting to 
Theater (ALERT) squadron using the BMDO-developed 
TALON SHIELD system at Falcon AFB, Colorado. The 
Joint Tactical Ground System (JTAGS), also developed by 
BMDO is a complementary tactical mobile Defense Support 
Program (DSP) ground station for theater-wide use. Two 
prototypical units have been deployed by the Army in 
Germany and South Korea to support the warfighter, and 
five more units will be deployed in fiscal years 1996 and 
1997.
     With these near-term improvements in the field, we will 
continue our efforts to develop and deploy lower-tier 
systems for TMD, the PAC-3 and Navy Area Defense 
Systems. These systems will be highly effective against the 
threat posed by short-to-medium range ballistic missiles of 
the type under development by North Korea and other 
countries. 
     We intend to provide this defensive capability as quickly 
as possible, building on existing infrastructure and prior 
investments in ongoing programs. This includes expanding 
the capabilities of the PATRIOT and AEGIS/Standard 
Missile systems and adding funds to deal with cost increases 
and development delays. 
     We are also working closely with our allies to develop a 
concept for a cooperative effort for a Medium Extended Air 
Defense System (MEADS) to protect large, mobile military 
units in forward locations. A Memorandum of 
Understanding will be signed this month by the U.S., 
France, Germany and Italy to jointly execute a program 
definition and validation phase for MEADS. 
     A TMD priority is also the improvement of our Battle 
Management, Command, Control and Communications 
(BMC3) capability.
     In order to ensure funds were available in the near-term 
to support rapid production and delivery of PAC-3 and 
Navy Area Defense, as well as to find approximately $2 
billion for DoD recapitalization initiatives, the Theater High 
Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system was reduced in 
scope, while maintaining focus on ensuring the User 
Operational Evaluation System (UOES) program was kept 
on track. 
     This will provide a system based on the THAAD UOES 
prototype, in lieu of the previously planned full-capability 
objective system. This will be more than UOES, a UOES-
plus system, with the upgrading of certain components, such 
as the infrared seeker, radar and BMC3. THAAD will 
achieve an initial UOES capability in fiscal year 1998, 
making the system available to an operational commander in 
a contingency.
     The Navy Theater-Wide system will receive an additional 
$600 million over the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), 
resulting in a more aggressive development effort and 
providing the necessary funds for definition of an optimal 
interceptor concept and a system technology demonstration.
     With regard to the future threat posed by ballistic missiles 
with the capability to reach the U.S. homeland, our goal is to 
position the U.S. to effectively respond to the threat as it 
emerges. The Program Review redirected our National 
Missile Defense (NMD) efforts from a technology readiness 
program to a deployment readiness program. 
     We are now focusing our efforts on a program referred 
to as "3+3," meaning a three year development and planning 
phase that, if necessary, could be followed by a three year 
system acquisition and deployment phase. During the three 
year development phase, BMDO and the Services will begin 
development and testing elements of an initial NMD system. 
Based on upon the ballistic missile threat, a decision will be 
made at the end of the three-year development and testing 
phase to determine if an NMD system is warranted. If so, an 
initial defensive capability could be deployed. 
     Based on this program, initial capability could be 
achieved in approximately six years, by the year 2003.
     Our technology development will also continue in order 
to meet critical requirements essential to maintaining our 
technological edge. Since nowhere else in the Department of 
Defense are these technology programs funded, the strategic 
investment of these programs in the BMD budget is critical 
to continued success and viability of the BMD program.
     Along with all the men and women of BMDO, the 
supporting Services and our contractors, I am dedicated to 
ensuring that we field improved missile defense systems as 
soon as possible to provide real protection for our forward 
deployed forces, friends and allies. We have made very 
strong progress in developing and acquiring improved 
systems, putting "rubber on the ramp," due to a very strong 
and enduring Executive-Legislative consensus on TMD.
     As many of BMD Monitor's readers may know, I intend 
to retire from the U.S. Army this year. It has been an honor 
and a privilege to serve as the leader of this vital DOD 
program. I'm sure the next Director of BMDO will read 
with great interest -- as I've always done -- the BMD 
Monitor during the future evolution of this vital national 
defense program.

Skipper wired backwards

     The final Bow Shock experiment failed because scientists 
wired a battery charger backwards.
     The joint U.S.-Russian Skipper Flight Experiment was 
launched Dec. 27, but the craft went dark after only a day 
(BMDM, 1/12).
     BMDO's Innovative Science and Technology Directorate 
funded the mission: about $7 million for the satellite and 
another $1 million for operations.
     Utah State University scientists had worked with Russian 
scientists to build the satellite, which was the last of three 
experiments to investigate the hock flow field in front of the 
satellite and collect information on ultraviolet emissions in 
orbit and high-velocity reentry in a 30 day mission.
     USU's main engineer for the mission, James Cantrell 
told the Utah Herald Journal the solar panels designed to 
recharge the satellite's battery had been connected backward. 
"They were hooked up in reverse polarity and had the effect 
of discharging the battery instead of charging it." 
     "It's always the simple stuff that kills you," he said. "It 
should have been caught in the design stage but wasn't."
     The United National Security Council demands Iraq 
allow "immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access" for 
U.N. inspectors, investigating suspected weapons sites. 
There has been five disputes in 10 days.
     "In all of these cases access was subsequently granted 
only after unacceptable delays," the council said. In a 
statement read at a formal meeting and approved by all 15 
members, the council said the delays "constitute clear 
violations by Iraq" of several post-Gulf War Security 
Council resolutions.
     Under Gulf War Security Council resolutions, Iraq is 
obligated to disclose and destroy all stocks and facilities 
relating to ballistic missile, nuclear, chemical, biological 
programs.
     Rolf Ekeus said the inspectors were searching for 
ballistic missile components and documents during the five 
inspections. Analysis continues, but Ekeus reported no 
dramatic discoveries.
     Weapons inspectors must certify Iraq has rid itself of all 
forbidden weapons.
       The first missile tests and show of force off Taiwan 
were a success, China's state news agency Xinhua said this 
week.
     A second series of exercises, that were to run through the 
presidential elections on Taiwan this weekend, are on hold 
due to bad weather.
     China is applying psychological pressure to halt any 
independence moves by Taiwan, which Beijing considers a 
renegade province. Taiwan denies it is seeking 
independence.
     Hong Kong's Beijing-financed Wen Wei Po quoted 
Chinese military experts as saying it would take just five or 
six hours for PLA troops to cross the 130-mile strait.
     U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry and other U.S. 
experts have said China does not have the capability to 
invade Taiwan.
     Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said tension 
with India is a threat to regional peace, citing India's planned 
development of medium- and long-range missiles.
     "Recently, the Indians test experimented a short-range 
missile and they are planning to develop medium- and long-
range missiles. If this happens, Pakistan
would be forced into positions that it does not wish to take," 
she said in an interview with Reuters Television in Jakarta 
during a three-day visit.
     The PM called on the international community to focus 
on the subcontinent and help the two countries sort out their 
disputes just as it had helped in the Middle East peace 
process, confronted South African apartheid and tried to ease
tension in Northern Ireland.
     She said India and Pakistan have large arsenals, but 
added that Pakistan was trying to prevent a major arms race 
in South Asia.
     Marking the 50th anniversary of Winston Churchill's 
"iron curtain" speech at Westminster College, Mo., former 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported ballistic 
missile defenses.
     Thatcher said the world faces more complex dangers than 
it did a decade ago even though the Cold War is over.
     In her March 10 speech, titled "New Threats for Old," 
Thatcher said "because the risk of total nuclear annihilation 
has been removed, we in the West have lapsed into an 
alarming complacency about the risks that remain."
     Thatcher called for NATO cooperation against the nuclear 
threat posed by "rogue" states.
     "If America and its allies cannot deal with the problem 
directly by pre-emptive means, they must at least diminish 
the incentive for the Saddams, the Gadhafis and others to 
acquire new weapons in the first place," she said.
     "That means the West must install effective ballistic 
missile defense, which would protect us and our armed 
forces, reduce or even nullify the rogue state's arsenal and 
enable us to retaliate."
     Thatcher said NATO should implement the missile 
defense system, and should offer full membership to 
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
     "NATO provides the best available mechanism for 
coordinating the contribution of America's allies to global 
system of ballistic missile defense -- that is, one providing 
protection against missile attack from whatever source it 
comes," she said.
         When the "Iron Lady" was England's prime minister 
she was a strong supporter of former President Ronald 
Reagan's SDI program.
     U.N. and African officials said a treaty declaring Africa a 
nuclear weapons-free zone should prompt the Middle East 
to do the same.
     Signing of the African treaty is expected to begin April 
11. It had been negotiated between 1991 and 1995, and 28 
states must sign before it enters into force.
     Egypt's ambassador to the U.N., while in Geneva, said 
Israel must first sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
     Under the Treaty of Pelindaba, named after a nuclear site 
in South Africa, some 53 African states will pledge not to 
develop, stock or test any nuclear explosive device, dump 
imported radioactive waste or attack nuclear installations. 
     Foreign ministers from the five declared nuclear weapon 
states have been invited to the ceremony. They will be asked 
to sign a treaty protocol, pledging not to use or threaten to 
use a nuclear explosive device against any treaty party, or 
conduct underground test explosions in any territory situated 
within the African nuclear weapon-free zone.
     The African treaty follows similar nuclear-free pacts in 
Latin America (1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco) and the South 
Pacific (1986 Treaty of Rarotonga).
          Preparations have begun for International Atomic 
Energy Agency experts to conduct 18 months of 
investigations at the former French South Pacific nuclear test 
site of Mururoa on the impact of the tests on the 
environment.
     IAEA experts from 10 countries are due to begin the 
work in a few months.
     in the last 30 years there have been 141 explosions at the 
atoll, the final six concluded in January to an international 
outcry.
     Future tests will be done by computer simulation, and the 
test site will be dismantled.
     Environmental groups are concerned the tests may have 
contaminated the atolls and surrounding waters, cracking the 
atolls' basalt foundation to allow radioactivity to leak out.
     French authorities deny the tests caused any damage.

BMDO works the international BMD circuit

     The DoD's international Ballistic Missile Defense effort 
aims at increasing the effectiveness and compatibility of 
BMD programs and cutting their costs.
     BMDO is the lead agency and contributes funds to the 
international project, which includes U.S. allies and friends. 
     The international programs were discussed before 
Congress this month by BMDO director Lt. Gen. Malcolm 
O'Neill, during a separate briefing by a senior BMDO 
official and as contained in BMDO's 1995 Report to 
Congress.
     Some of the details are published below.
Israel pursues BMD program 
     Israel has been working with the United States on a 
BMD program centered around the Arrow missile.
     The Arrow/ACES program continues, while the Arrow 
Deployability Program (ADP), which would integrate the 
missile, launcher, radar and battle management into an 
Arrow Weapon System has been negotiated and is ready to 
be signed (BMDM, 3/8). 
     A user operational evaluation system-like Arrow system 
is projected for fielding in fiscal year 1998.
     The ADP involves $500 million over five years: $300 
million from Israel, $200 million from the United States.
     An Israeli Test Bed is also operational.
     Since 1994, BMDO and Israel have been working on 
Boost Phase Intercept (BPI). In fiscal year 1995, BMDO 
was looking at the Israel concept developed in FY 1994, 
using simulations and analysis to determine whether 
coalition force and Israeli concepts had anything in common. 
     A senior BMDO official said, at a recent briefing for 
defense reporters, that the BPI project is a $15 million to $20 
million program over about three years.
U.K. to complete BMD requirements this summer
     An 18-month "Pre-Feasibility Study," to define BMD 
requirements, is expected to be completed this year, 
probably in June, the BMDO official said. The study will be 
followed by a policy paper on missile defense.
     The United Kingdom has been working on cooperative 
R&D experiments and joint trials with BMDO.
     Also involved are exchanges of scientists and 
information.
     MEADS MOU expected this month
     The cooperative agreement among the United States, 
France, Germany and Italy on the Medium Air Defense 
System is expected this month, according to O'Neill's 
testimony before the House National Security Committee 
March 7.
     The Memorandum of Agreement will detail how the four 
nations will conduct MEADS' definition/validation phase of 
the program. 
     The Statement of Intent was signed in February 1995 for 
a medium-to-low-altitude point and limited area defense for 
the protection of maneuver forces against the threat of 
tactical ballistic missiles and air breathing targets, including 
cruise missiles (BMDM, 2/24/95).
Germany to buy Patriot upgrades
     Germany is also involved in the acquisition of Patriot 
Upgrades.
     An Extended Air Defense command and control 
compatibility agreement has been implemented, and an 
agreement on the Extended Air Defense Test Bed has been 
approved. 
     Germany will buy the equipment and software, all off-
the-shelf, and Army Space and Strategic Defense Command 
will install the test bed software. The test bed can be used as 
a common simulation tool in the Medium Air Defense 
System program. 
NATO looks at TMD
     NATO is looking at a number of TMD related issues. 
They include proliferation, active missile defense 
configurations and costs and battle management, command, 
control and communications requirements.
     A NATO working group, of eight nations, has been set 
up under the Conference of National Armaments Directors 
to uncover other TMD cooperative opportunities.
     The Netherlands is particularly interested in TMD, and is 
reviewing requirements to determine how Patriot, Standard 
Missile-2 Block IVA and Cooperative Engagement 
Capability might fit the country's needs.
Russia works on cooperative programs
     Russia is working on joint experiments with the United 
States, including the recent Skipper Bow Shock 
experimental satellite launched from Russia in December.
     A nonproliferation study, which explores areas of future 
cooperation, is expected to be conducted.  
     Another cooperative program is the joint Active 
Geophysical Rocket Experiment. It will investigate the 
effects of an explosive plasma jet on the ionosphere and 
evaluate vehicle environmental interactions.
     An experimental satellite program, the Russian-American 
Observation Stereo Satellites, has been in the works for 
some time (BMDM, 9/23/94). 
     French requirements include BMD
     Emerging requirements for France include BMD. 
     France is working with the United States on EAD 
Simulations and plume phenomenology. Its officials are 
considering agreements on reentry signature 
phenomenology and lethality.
     Army Space and Strategic Defense Command has 
presented the EAD Simulation to France, so its scientists 
can compare it with their own system. It could be used for 
simulated MEADS exercises and training.
     Japan studies BMD
     The United States and Japan are cooperating on a bilateral 
study of BMD, which examines options for defending Japan 
against regional missile threats.
     The Japanese-led study is expected to be completed this 
year. 
     Japan is upgrading systems to build a TMD capability. In 
1994 it started licensed production of PATRIOT PAC-2, 
received AEGIS destroyers.
     Japan also plans to buy four Airborne Warning and 
Control aircraft.

TMD Budget: getting programs operational 

     The BMDO fiscal year 1997 budget request reflects the 
recent restructuring from the BMD program review, 
emphasizing fielding near-term and core TMD programs.
     The program review reaffirmed TMD as the top priority: 
to defend against the existing short-to-medium range mis-
siles, followed by adding wide area defenses against the 
longer range missiles as the threat develops (BMDM, 2/23).
     The restructuring will make changes in the previous 
theater schedule. 
     In FY 1997, BMDO funding is split 74%, $2.063 billion 
for theater missile defense, 18%, $508 million for national 
missile defense, and 8%, $226 million for support 
technology.
     The Army will again consume 60% of the proposed FY 
1997 budget. The Navy gets 16%, the Air Force 5%, and 
other agencies 2%. BMDO's share is 17%.
     Responding to congressional questioning about his 
proposed budget March 7, BMDO boss Lt. Gen. Malcolm 
O'Neill said moving more money into the program would 
allow him to conduct more testing, He noted, however, 
additional money won't speed up all programs.
     The Patriot PAC-3 program, for instance, has "fact of 
life" problems, such as engineering, that money alone can't 
fix.
     O'Neill is also looking for ways that don't necessarily 
involve money to move the first unit equipped with the 
THAAD missile system back from the restructuring 
program date of 2006. 
     The date moved from 2002 to 2006 after the program 
review when nearly $2 billion was cut from the program. 
Putting money back in the program would allow a robust 
program shakedown sooner.
     At a background briefing for defense reporters March 11, 
a senior BMDO official said the Army is seeking ways to 
speed up the program, though there are no specifics as yet.
     The official said fielding the THAAD system will give 
the military the first capability to match the threat.

BMDO five-year plan shows restructuring 

     BMDO resources for the Future Years Defense 
Program, fiscal years 1997-2001, expects $10 billion for 
TMD, $2 billion for NMD and $1 billion for Support 
Technology.
     The change in resource allocation, as envisioned last year 
for FYs 1995-2001 and this year's plans for FYs 1997-
2001, is clear.

Washington Insider O'Neill: theater systems can't take 
NMD's role

     In his last appearance before the Senate Appropriations 
Defense subcommittee March 20, BMDO Director Lt. Gen. 
Malcolm O'Neill said theater systems such as THAAD and 
Aegis can't fulfill the national missile defense role, now.
     Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii) asked O'Neill what could 
be done to protect Hawaii from the missile threat. 
     O'Neill said the Navy Aegis system cannot defend 
Alaska or Hawaii against missile attack. The incoming 
warhead would be travelling too fast. 
     He said the Aegis radar does not see far enough out, and 
a THAAD missile can not fly soon enough or high enough 
to intercept that kind of warhead.
     "We do not have enough warning assets to guard against 
rogue nation threats," O'Neill said, "If you wish to field 
strategic defense, from a maritime system, you will need to 
field new spaceborne sensors or airborne radar."
     On another subject, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said he 
planned to demand "a complete accounting, line-by-line, or 
all the funds you expend." Shelby said he had heard reports 
that BMDO appeared to be growing its own infrastructure at 
the expense of the services.
     This week high winds at altitude scrubbed a planned 
THAAD intercept test flight at White Sands Missile Range, 
N.M.
     A mid-February attempt was also scrubbed. 
     It is not the winds at ground level, but higher altitude 
winds up to 70,000 feet.
     If there are high winds at altitude, debris will stray from 
the range, causing safety problems.
     One of the problems encountered is that a shot can't be 
re-scheduled quickly since White Sands has a lot of on-
going activities. 
     The mobile tactical Defense Support Program ground 
station Joint Tactical Ground System (JTAGS) office signed 
the paperwork March 12 with Aerojet to exercise the 
production option.
     The Milestone III meeting was held Feb. 26 and the 
Program Executive Officer, Missile Defense, gave approval 
to proceed (BMDM, 1/26).
     The Army plans to buy three new JTAGS units and 
refurbish the two engineering and manufacturing 
development units. The first new unit will be delivered in 
October.
     The system is slated for fielding in fiscal year 1997.
     Two prototype units have been deployed by the Army; 
one in Germany and one in South Korea.  
     The U.S. military is on the verge of forming a "system of 
systems," able to see all relevant enemy assets on the 
battlefield, communicating this information almost instantly 
to combat units, and striking at these targets with 
unprecedented lethality. 
     That is one of the trends identified in "Strategic 
Assessment 1996: The Instruments of U.S. Power," the 
annual assessment done by the Institute of National Strategic 
Studies of the National Defense University.
     The assessment also said increased reliance on military 
and civilian information systems will require measures to 
protect these systems from attack.
     Another trend noted in the report is that cutting edge 
research is being done more by the private sector and less by 
the DoD. There will be an increasing need to adapt 
commercial developments to military systems.
     The assessment was prepared by a 20-member team of 
civilian and military fellows. It is described by DoD as an 
independent analysis.
     Among its main conclusions the report said DoD has a 
wider variety of tasks in the post-Cold War period, and is 
developing a broader range of instruments to manage them.
     Another conclusion was public pressure to balance the 
federal budget could push defense and national security 
spending below the levels projected by either the 
administration or Congress. Such a situation might limit the
United States' ability to continue to exert its influence and 
protect its interests around the world.

     "The Pentagon has taken a major step in reining in the 
run-away ballistic missile defense program that needlessly 
threatened future progress in strategic arms control," 
Spurgeon Keeny said.
     Keeny, president and executive director, The Arms 
Control Assn., said in an editorial advisory this week the 
BMD restructuring improves the chances that Russia will 
ratify START II and further reduce strategic nuclear 
arsenals.
     Keeny said the new TMD program is less threatening to 
Russia, and should help the United States get Russian 
agreement on a clarification of acceptable TMD parameters 
under the ABM Treaty.  
     Keeny said President Clinton must support the secretary 
of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff on the restructured 
program. 
     While Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., emphasizes experience 
and responsibility, Keeny said Dole "should not attack a step 
toward sanity in the ballistic misisle defense program in an 
effort to create a non-existent ballistic missile defense gap as 
a campaign issue."
     The House Appropriations Committee has added two 
seats, one Republican and one Democrat. That makes the 
partisan ratio 33-25.
     The addition of a New York Democrat, Jose Serrano, 
comes because Rep. Mike Parker, Miss., bolted to the 
Republican side last November.
     Serrano will be back in the seat he lost after Republican 
leaders reduced the Democratic seats to make the committee 
ratio reflect overall partisan House ratios.
     The House has adopted the State Dept. Authorization bill 
conference report, but the bill faces an uncertain future.
     The White House has said the president would veto the 
bill, out of strong disagreement over a provision to eliminate 
one of three independent foreign affairs agencies:  the Arms 
Control and Disarmament Agency, the Agency for 
International Development and the U.S. Information 
Agency.      The eliminated agency would be folded into the 
State Dept. But Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
Chairman Jesse Helms,' R-N.C., has proposal dumping all 
three agencies.
     Senate Democrats have said they might filibuster when 
the bill comes to the floor.     
     Ceremonies in Huntsville, Ala., last week marked the 
changeover from Brig. Gen. Richard Black to Col. (P) Dan 
Montgomery as Program Executive Office, Missile 
Defense.          
     Flags, bands and some 600 people attended, including 
BMDO Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill and Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, 
boss, Army Space and Strategic Defense Command.
          The 1996 BMDO program briefing to industry and 
government has been moved to April 9-10 at the State Dept. 
(BMDM, 3/8).
     Only those with a current Secret clearance may attend. 
According to the American Defense Preparedness Assn., 
which supports the briefing, the classification is "to allow 
briefer to share more details and sensitive aspects of the 
threat, program and future action visions."
     BMDO will provide a program review with presentations 
and discussions on timely, relevant activities affecting 
BMDO, the latest TMD initiatives, the current status of the 
NMD program and ABM treaty impacts/updates.
     Speakers include Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, 
Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology 
Paul Kaminski, and Air Force Gen. Joe Ralston, Vice 
Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
     There will also be a forecast of expected contract 
opportunities for the current and upcoming fiscal years.
     The conference is aimed at U.S. industry and government 
missile defense decision makers, scientists, and program 
planners in R&D, contracting, and marketing. 
     Small and disadvantaged businesses are also encouraged
to attend.

     Senate Republicans are raising the stakes on missile 
defense this election year.
     Majority leader and presidential candidate Bob Dole, R-
Kan., and 26 of his colleagues wrote President Clinton that 
"we will not hesitate to alter the budget request" to bring it in 
line with the Fiscal Year 1996 Defense authorization act 
provisions.
     The Senators cited their strong support of BMD and 
commitment to future funding of the Space and Missile 
Tracking System, THAAD and Navy Upper Tier.
     Their displeasure with the president's budget request 
comes in funding levels for THAAD and Navy Upper Tier, 
which they write are "insufficient."
     The March 7 letter was also signed by Strom Thurmond, 
S.C., chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee; Jesse 
Helms, N.C., chairman, Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee; John Warner, Va.; Richard Shelby, Ala.; Ted 
Stevens, Alaska; Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas; Spencer 
Abraham, Mich.; Conrad Burns, Mont.; Rick Santorum, 
Penn.; Bob Smith, N.H.; Mike DeWine, Ohio; Paul 
Coverdell, Ga.; Connie Mack, Fla.; Don Nickles, and James 
Inhofe, Okla.; John McCain and Jon Kyl, Ariz.; Thad 
Cochran, Miss.; Larry Craig, Idaho; Charles Grassley, Iowa; 
Rod Grams, Minn.; John Ashcroft, Mo.; Mitch McConnell, 
Ky.; Orrin Hatch, Utah; Al Simpson, Wyo.; Trent Lott, 
Miss. 
     The Union of Concerned Scientists continues to push the 
other side of the NMD issue.
     UCS said calls for the United States to get out of the 
ABM Treaty would shake U.S.-Russian relations, and 
impede arms control efforts such as strategic arms 
reduction.
     The UCS also said Republicans such as Rep. Curt 
Weldon, Pa., and Sen. Strom Thurmond, S.C., are trying to 
make missile defenses an election year issue.
     Last year UCS wrote to Congress that the push for a 
national missile defense is based on ideology not sound 
science or policy, and that efforts to resurrect NMD are 
"misguided and irresponsible."
          Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Norman Wood has been 
appointed president and CEO, Armed Forces 
Communications and Electronics Assn. effective April 1.
     Wood succeeds retired Adm. James Busey IV, who is 
retiring after more than three years as AFCEA president and 
CEO.
     Wood joins AFCEA from BDM Federal Inc., where he 
was senior vice president and general manager, responsible 
for management of national security and technology 
applications programs, resources and marketing, focusing 
on the intelligence community.
     A minimum sentence of 10 months in prison was 
imposed on two peace-activists for vandalizing Trident 
missile shells at a Lockheed Martin factory last August 
(BMDM, 8/11/95). 
     Federal district judge James Ware imposed sentence on 
Susan Crane and Steven Kelly, saying they had acted out of 
sincere beliefs, "but nevertheless, you violated the law."
     He urged them to "work with the law or try to change it."
     Crane and Kelly were convicted of conspiracy and 
vandalism after jumping a fence at Lockheed Missiles and 
Space in Sunnyvale, hammering two missile shells and 
splattering them with their own blood.
   Because they have spent seven months in custody after 
refusing bail, they will serve only three months in prison, 
then two years on probation.
   The Assistant U.S. Attorney said the sentence was lenient 
for the nearly $400,000 damage done to the missile shells.      
About 100 supporters packed the courtroom, singing "We 
Shall Overcome" before the hearing and giving the 
defendants a standing ovation afterward.
     The former KGB general who targeted U.S. rocket fuel 
formulas and his Cold War antagonist have gone 
Hollywood.
     Oleg Kalugin and former CIA director William Colby 
play themselves in a new interactive CD-ROM game, 
"Spycraft: The Great Game."
     In the game, a politician, vaguely resembling nationalist 
presidential candidate Vladimir Zhirinovsky, is shot in Red 
Square. Players have to figure out who did it
with help from Colby and Kalugin, who join forces to save 
civilization from the Russian mafia.
     To solve the case, players are shown a dazzling array of 
gizmos, including satellite imagery, sound detection devices 
and weaponry that would make James Bond's armorer 
envious.
     "We have many kinds of games used in the government 
for training and to stretch the minds a bit," said Colby. 
"Those games are normally strategic. This one is at the case 
officer level."
     Something new is that the Spycraft player can go on the 
Internet and access the graphic Web pages for the real CIA, 
FBI and other federal agencies, using Intelink, a fictional 
intelligence communications network that really goes online.
   Through the online feature, the game blends real world 
news reports with fictional scenarios in playing time that can 
last up to 40 hours. The game is out this month.
     The McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper-Experimental 
Advanced (DC-XA) rolled out of the Huntington Beach, 
Calif., site March 15.
     The next stop for the single-stage-to-orbit vehicle is 
White Sands Missile Range, N.M., where it will be prepped 
for flight tests that are to start in May.
     The prototype DC-X was developed under BMDO 
direction, and is now being developed under a cooperative 
agreement between NASA and McDonnell Douglas to 
demonstrate new technologies needed for a reliable, 
affordable reusable launch vehicle that could be operated 
commercially by American industry with NASA as one  of 
its customers. 
     DC-XA project manager Dan Dumbacher, NASA 
Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala., said "this is a 
radically different vehicle from the DC-X that flew last year... ." 
     The DC-XA will be the first rocket ever to fly with a  
composite hydrogen tank. The tank, built by McDonnell  
Douglas, is made of graphite-epoxy and is 1,200 pounds
lighter than the aluminum tank used in the DC-X. 
     The flight tests will demonstrate the hydrogen tank's 
performance as well as other new advanced technology 
components, including a Russian-built aluminum-lithium 
alloy liquid oxygen tank; a composite intertank to connect 
the hydrogen and oxygen tanks; and an auxiliary propulsion 
system consisting of a composite liquid hydrogen feedline, a 
composite liquid hydrogen valve and a liquid-to-gas 
conversion system in the flight reaction control system.
     Air Force Phillips Lab will manage flight test operations. 
     NASA's investment in the DC-XA program is $20 
million for hardware and $30 million for integration.  
     NASA's Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va., and 
Dryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, Calif., also 
support DC-XA.

Ten years ago ... the more things change ...

     Saturday, March 23 is the 13th anniversary of President 
Ronald Reagan's "star wars" speech, which was the impetus 
for the Strategic Defense Initiative.
     Since then, SDIO was refocused from a strategic, space 
oriented organization to the BMDO, with its focus on theater 
missile defense. BMDO just finished refocusing the 
program.
     Some things never change -- the tug of war over the 
budget.
     In March 1986, SDIO was adjusting its fiscal year 1986 
budget to close the gap between the Reagan administration's 
$3.7 billion request and the final congressional appropriation 
of $2.75 billion. 
     Half the billion in cuts came from sensor experiments, 
delaying or cancelling a boost surveillance and tracking 
system demonstration as well as a comprehensive flight 
experiment for the space surveillance and tracking system.
     The FY 1987 budget request was $4.8 billion.
     The SDIO FYs 1986-1987 program emphasized the 
ground-based laser;  continued Kinetic Energy Weapons 
such as ERIS, HEDI; sensor technology and database 
collection experiments (not prototypes); architectural 
definitions of systems; battle management, command, 
control and communications, its impact on architectures and 
the national test bed; survivability and lethality experiments 
and interactive discrimination.
     SDIO's Innovative Science and Technology FY 1986 
funding was $98.6 million. For 1987, SDIO wanted to 
request about $140 million, a 42% increase.
     The hot topics in 1986 were advanced high-speed 
computing, sensing, discrimination and data processing, 
space science and experimentation, advanced space power 
experimentation, directed and kinetic energy concepts and 
materials structures and propellants.
     Deputy IS&T Director Dwight Dustin (now Assistant 
Deputy for Technology) said SDIO was interested in laser 
satellite networking and micro-refrigeration techniques for 
IR sensors, and might look at starting work on a boost phase 
discrimination technique, spotting hard bodies rather than 
plumes.
     Theater ballistic missile defense was one of the 
configurations being examined by SDIO's systems 
architecture study.
     SDIO officials said that while tactical missiles allow less 
warning time than ICBMs, their slower speeds would ease 
some of the requirements for intercept.
     Boost phase and midcourse ATBMD intercepts could be 
done by space-based components of an SDI-constellation.
     The American Defense Preparedness Assn. and SDIO 
presented the Homing Overlay Experiment with the 1986 
"strategic defense technical achievement."
     The award came at a black-tie commemoration of the 
third anniversary of President Reagan's March 23, 1983, 
speech that called for research on ballistic missile defense.
     Paul Nitze, special advisor to Reagan, cited the technical 
achievements of SDI as an opportunity to establish "a more 
stable form of deterrence for American and global security 
concerns."
     While the SDI was an open program, in January 1986 
things started to get tight - all SDIO visitors had to check in 
at a visitor control center to get badges if they wanted to visit 
SDIO officials at the downtown Washington offices.

Missile defense gets its own 'Skunk' worker

     Two-time Grammy winner Jeff "Skunk" Baxter has been 
tapped to lead a new Citizens Advisory Panel on Missile 
Defense.
     At a press conference held hot on the heels of budget 
testimony by BMDO director Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill 
March 7, Curt Weldon, R-Pa., Research and Development 
subcommittee chairman, announced Baxter will help 
organize the panel.
     Baxter, the former Doobie Brothers guitarist and founder 
of Steely Dan is a long-time friend and advisor to Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher, R-Calif.
     Weldon, flanked by (as was said, "there's Pink Floyd and 
the real") Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman, House 
National Security Committee, and missile defense supporter 
Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., said the panel will help educate 
people about America's vulnerabilities from missile attack 
and need for national missile defense. 
     The panel also will encourage members of Congress to 
hop on the missile bandwagon.
     "We need all the help we can get," Spence added.
     Baxter said his job is to bring together everyone who has 
anything to say about missile defense. Including those who 
tinker with technology in their workshops -- no just the big 
defense contractors.   
     Baxter said missile defense technology is available, and a 
national missile defense is affordable. The country can't 
afford to be without the protection, he added. 
     A deployed system also broadens the options for political 
leaders, he said.
     Baxter, who has 16 gold records and eight platinum, lives 
in Beverly Hills, and wrote the original main theme of 
"Beverly Hills, 90210," said his role as entertainer is double-
edged, and it attracts attention.
     "First of all, you're here," he told the room full of 
reporters, Capitol Hill staffers and others. He also noted that 
the music industry is very high-tech, involving computers, 
data storage and digital communications -- much of which 
evolved from the defense industry.
     He first became involved in missile defense because of 
his work on guitar design, through an SDIO project at 
Lawrence Livermore National Lab on microwave radar, now 
applied in guitar amplifiers. From his self-generated interest 
in missile defense issues, Baxter has written Op-Ed pieces 
and position papers on the ABM Treaty and NATO and 
lectured on "The Future of Ballistic Missile Defense.
     The missile panel is yet to become a formal entity. But 
Baxter said he envisions a "website" or clearing house for 
missile defense information available to members of 
congress and the public.

Woolsey, Perle, Krepon: don't scrap ABM Treaty yet 

     Testifying before the House National Security Committee 
March 14 several experts gave their views on missile 
defense and ABM Treaty pitfalls. But none called for the 
immediate dumping of the treaty by the United States.
      There were former CIA director R. James Woolsey, 
former assistant secretary of Defense for International 
Security Policy Richard Perle, and the president of the Henry 
L. Stimson Center Michael Krepon. All said the ABM 
Treaty could be revisited. 
     The hearing was part of the committee's effort to consider 
treaty issues as it weighs the president's fiscal year 1997 
budget request for ballistic missile defense.

Woolsey has reservations about ABM Treaty

     Woolsey said he would "defer" for now whether the 
United States should consider withdrawing from the treaty. 
     Woolsey said with a firm negotiating approach to the 
Russians and enough funding for BMD programs, "we 
should be able to accommodate our needs within the treaty 
for some time if it is appropriately interpreted and, possibly, 
modified."
     A cooperative approach of treaty modification and 
cooperative programs could be one way to go, he added.
     As part of this cooperative effort "we might be willing to 
supply the Russians, as well as other nations, with data from 
our space-enhanced sensors such as Brilliant Eyes," 
Woolsey added.

Perle: ABM question is one of policy, not law

     Richard Perle told the committee instead of negotiating 
limits on theater missile performance, the United States 
should simply state theater defenses are not covered under 
the ABM Treaty.
     Perle said if the Russians said the theater defense 
program violates the treaty they can file a complaint with the 
Standing Consultative Commission, while the United States 
continues developing TMD.
     It is a policy matter, not a legal issue, Perle said. The 
threat of a Soviet missile attack on the United States that the 
treaty is concerned with is now irrelevant, he added. Now 
the danger is in a theater missile acquisition or attack on 
deployed troops and allies.
     Perle urged congress to insist on revising the ABM 
Treaty under its own provisions, and "under no 
circumstances" limit the effective deployment of theater 
systems.

No compelling reason to dump the treaty

     Krepon said "the ballistic missile threat provides no 
compelling reason to trash President Nixon's handiwork.
     Krepon said the treaty should not be considered set in 
stone, but as a living document that can be amended.
     The treaty is a safety net for U.S.- Russian relations, 
Krepon said, for without it, tensions would continue, 
cooperation would be difficult, and START II Treaty arms 
reductions would become difficult.
     National Missile Defense, Krepon said, is the last line of 
defense. The front lines include global efforts such as 
counterproliferation, diplomacy and transparency, backed by 
conventional forces. The last line of defense is intercepting 
missiles and warheads in flight.
     Krepon urged congress to increase spending in other 
missile defense areas, noting "we are spending extremely 
large sums for the last fifteen minutes of the problem, while 
short-changing the front lines of defense against weapons of 
mass destruction."

Heritage Foundation team updates missile defense report

     Led by former SDIO Director Henry Cooper, the 
Heritage Foundation's Team B missile defense study squad 
has updated its 1995 report on the missile defense of the 
United States and its troops.
     The update of "Defending America: A Near- and Long-
Term Plan to Deploy Missile Defenses" (BMDM, 6/16/95) 
again calls for the United States to consider withdrawing 
from the ABM Treaty and adopting a two-tier, Theater 
Missile Defense (TMD)/National Missile Defense (NMD) 
plan by building sea- and space-based missile protections.
     As BMD Monitor went to press, legislation was expected 
to be filed on National Missile Defense and the ABM 
Treaty, March 21. 
     The top priority should be expanding Navy Upper Tier 
for deployment, beginning in 2000 as the earliest, for 
defense of the continental United States and deployed troops, 
the new report said.
     The differences between Team B's and the Clinton 
administration's views continue to be well defined. The 
update and the 1995 report concluded "the threat is clear, 
present and growing; and that it demands an urgent 
response."      The administration, however, does not believe 
the threat is imminent. Unclassified reports on the latest 
National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) suggest the threat is 
years away and there is sufficient time to build defenses 
before the threat materializes.
     The difference has caused Republicans to call the NIE 
"politicized."

Funding plan offered for FYs 1996-2001

     Team B offered their own funding recommendations for 
missile defense systems from fiscal Years 1996 through 
2001 (see chart above).
     Additional funds this year could be found by shifting 
NMD funds from ground-based to sea- and space-based 
programs. 

Update offers recommendations

     The update offers recommendations for Congress to 
consider as the fiscal year 1997 budget evolves on Capitol 
Hill:
     -- Review the administration's ballistic missile threat 
assessment and direct a more prudent approach to accelerate 
the development of appropriate responses.
     -- Review the ABM Treaty limits, and insist the most 
effective, affordable near-term defenses be developed 
without treaty constraints at an accelerated pace.
     -- Move the United States to withdraw from the ABM 
Treaty after six months notice.
     -- Redirect last year's consensus objective of deploying 
ground-based defenses for the United States by 2003 and 
focus on deploying of sea-based, wide-area defenses by 
2000 without ABM Treaty constraints.
     -- Direct the Air Force to accelerate Brilliant Eyes 
deployment, starting as early as 1999, develop follow-on 
space-based defenses for deployment early in the next 
decade, including kinetic energy interceptors and space-
based lasers.
     -- Direct the Army to focus on developing and deploying 
ground-based TMD to support U.S. troops and allies 
overseas, restore the $2 billion removed from THAAD, and 
make 2000 as the initial deployment date.
     -- Ensure BMDO develops an open, integrated 
architecture for battle management, command, control and 
communication.

Panel: appoint an intelligence systems architect at DoD

     A central office for providing national and tactical 
intelligence information to field commanders and solving 
associated problems should be established by the Pentagon.           
This recommendation is from The Commission on the 
Roles and Capabilities of the United States Intelligence 
Community.      
     The commission released its report March 1 in 
Washington, and briefed the president and other 
administration officials last week after a year-long effort to 
define intelligence area reforms and reorganization. 
     Commission staff member Douglas Horner discussed 
the report in a March 12 briefing sponsored by Open Source 
Solutions, Rosslyn, Va.
     The commission recommended DoD set an authority 
under DoD's assistant secretary of Defense, Command, 
Control Communications and Intelligence. The authority 
would cut across intelligence, surveillance and command, 
control and communications functions.
     The panel noted intelligence is useless if it doesn't get to 
military commanders in a form useful form for targeting 
and delivering precision weapons, for example.
     "It is imperative, therefore, that intelligence support to 
military operations be synchronized with global command, 
control and communications systems," the report said. 
     In its review, the commission found many areas of DoD 
are working the problems, but there is no central authority.
The authority would coordinate with groups to provide the 
recommendations and unified effort needed for combat.

DoD should snip overlaps

     The commission also recommended DoD examine the 
intelligence analytical and production organizations within 
the services and the Unified Commands to eliminate 
overlap.
     The commission expressed concern about the size of the 
organizations and "with what appears to be the tendency to 
exceed their core missions."
     The commission cited other issues associated with 
military intel budget decisions, compatibility, dissemination, 
and the growing pressures on tactical and national 
processing resources. 
     Satellite collection systems and precision weapon 
systems still need to be integrated, the report said, noting 
simulations to assess the performance and cost-effectiveness 
of intelligence capabilities are limited.
     A controversial recommendation puts DoD clandestine 
recruitment of human intelligence sources under the CIA.
Congress works on draft legislation     
     Senate Intelligence Oversight Committee Chairman 
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Vice Chairman Bob Kerrey, D-
Neb., are working the report's major recommendations into 
draft legislation (SI 593) to be marked up next month. 
     House Intel Chairman Larry Combest, R-Texas, is 
drafting related legislation (IC 21).      
     Overall the made three points: First, there is a need to 
integrate intelligence with the policy community. Second, 
intelligence agencies need to operate as a community. Third, 
intel agencies must be more efficient.

New aerostat CMD office takes off

     Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and 
Technology Paul Kaminski is slated April 4 to hear the plans 
for the new joint Aerostat Program Office for Cruise Missile 
Defense. 
     Meanwhile, the skeleton staff is working in assigned 
office space at the Army Space and Strategic Defense 
Command headquarters, Huntsville, Ala., which has 
operational control of the office.
     The staff is examining the lessons-learned and after 
action report on the performance of an aerostat that passed 
fire control info to a Marine Corps Hawk battalion in the 
recent Mountain Top experiment in Hawaii.
     While people tend to focus on the lighter-than-air tethered 
aerostat, the advanced sensors, which the aerostat will carry 
aloft, are the focus and more challenging part of project. The 
challenge includes detecting, tracking and relying accurate 
fire control info on land-attack cruise missiles. 
     The aerostat office may participate in Roving Sands '96, 
the annual joint air defense exercise held at Fort Bliss, Texas.

BMDO involved in CMD

     For more than a year, DoD has been discussing land-
attack cruise missile defense. However, BMDO has no 
formal tasking orders, a senior BMDO official told reporters 
March 11.
     Testifying before Congress March 7, BMDO director Lt. 
Gen. Malcolm O'Neill said many TMD sensors, battle 
management and weapons systems have an effective 
capability to counter the emerging land-attack cruise missile 
threat.
     The big picture, the system of systems command and 
control architecture, is being designed to be flexible so to 
accommodate cruise missile defense. 
     In particular, O'Neill said, Patriot PAC-3, Navy Area 
Defense and the Medium Extended Area Defense System 
operate in the same battlespace and will have "significant 
capability" against the threat.
     The National Missile Defense battle management, 
command, control and communication architecture will also 
be designed to promote compatibility and evolve into a 
common system for ballistic and cruise missile defense.
     O'Neill, before the House National Security Committee, 
and Kaminski, before the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, described other initiatives, including advanced 
technology sensors, upgrades to airborne platforms and the 
Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration of the 
aerostat sensor platform and interceptor upgrades, being 
worked outside of BMD. 

Inexpensive ways to solve the problem

     For defenders cruise missiles can cause more than 
headaches. The missiles fly below the coverage of surface-
based systems.
     But an Army official told BMD Monitor the new trick 
for combating cruise missiles involves elevating sensors, 
implementing the concept of Air-Directed Surface-to-Air 
Missiles. This means that an airborne sensor, hooked to an 
aerostat, provides sufficient fire control and update info to 
engage targets before ground-based systems detect them.
     Elevated sensors regain the battlespace lost by below 
surface system coverage due to the curvature of the Earth 
and terrain masking.
     The elevated sensors are expected to detect land-attack 
cruise missiles further out -- looking down over the terrain, 
picking up targets and relaying the information to surface-
based shooters.
     Sensor-carrying aerostats have advantages over Airborne 
Warning And Control (AWACS) and Joint Surveillance 
Target Attack Radar System aircraft (JSTARS) because the 
aircraft are performing other missions.
     JSTARS and AWACS add assets to missions, the Army 
official said, but are not as cost-effective as aerostats with 
sensors. Other solutions are not considered affordable at this 
time.
     In a Desert Shield environment, for instance, the official 
said, where there is limited activity for six months or more, 
an aerostat platform reduces the need for costly  fixed-wing 
aircraft. 
     Since the Army is concerned with a high operational 
tempo and maneuver issues, the elevated sensors can fill 
specific niches. Also such systems could be integrated with 
fixed-wing aircraft such as AWACS or JSTARS.
     The mix would come about as technology matures, the 
official said, and the architecture becomes integrated 
(BMDM, 2/9).

Technical sensor questions studied

     The technical work of the aerostatoffice centers on 
sensors, the official said. There is already a lot of 
information available on aerostats.
     The program office will determine payloads, flight 
requirements of up to 20,000 feet, range and visibility -- in 
determining the correct size of the aerostat.
     The office is considering mobility of the platform. The 
design of mooring systems is in its infancy, the official said, 
adding in the past there has been no requirement to develop 
mobile mooring systems.
     Analysis will examine the most cost-effective system.       
The details on how the sensor information will be integrated 
must be worked out, but the Army official said it is clear the 
platform must support joint forces.
     Other issues being examined include how the platform 
will fit into theater battle management, and what links will 
pass the information.
     Also under review is whether the information can be 
passed from the sensor directly to the shooter. 
     Other mission areas that the aerostat platform could 
address are being examined, but the primary focus is on 
detecting land-attack cruise missiles. 
Forget 'pop' goes the aerostat
     An aerostat is not as vulnerable as uspected, the official 
said. "While any system has vulnerabilities, people tend to 
believe that if they put a bullet in an aerostat it flies around 
like a birthday balloon and pops. But that's not so."
     It is extremely difficult to bring one down with bullets, he 
added. 
     And emissions from the sensors are no more vulnerable 
than those of other sensors, he added.
     The weather should not be a major concern since the 
aerostat is planned to fly at 15,000-20,000 feet altitude.

Dwindling BMDO technology program creates concern 

     BMDO's technology program is the seed for upgrades, 
sprouting new systems, but the agency is having a hard time 
nurturing the technology garden.
     During congressional testimony before congress this 
month, Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill, BMDO's director, said 
demands on BMD resources and the number of 
congressional earmarks have risen. "I am concerned that 
because of this we have been forced to reduce our 
technology program."
     The Advanced Technology program is the third priority 
for BMDO behind Theater Missile Defense and National 
Missile Defense. The proposed fiscal year 1997 funding 
allocation is $184 million, or 6% of the BMDO budget. The 
missile defense program review allocates $1.2 billion from 
FY 1997-2001.
     O'Neill said past technology developments have made 
today's acquisition programs possible, citing the "hit-to-kill" 
technology used by the Patriot PAC-3 missile. It evolved 
from the SDIO Flexible Lightweight Agile Guidance 
Experiment of the mid-1980s.
     BMD program restructuring has squeezed the technology 
program. Under SDIO, nearly 90% of the program was 
geared to technology research. The push to acquisition and 
deployment pushed the research part of the budget below the 
15%-20% levels the services traditionally allocate to science 
and technology (BMDM, 3/10/95). 
     Of concern to BMDO managers is the ability to respond 
with new technology to fix system problems or for 
countermeasures.
     One committee member noted that last year the 
technology budget was considered "bare bones." This year 
O'Neill said Congress should think of the Advanced 
Technology program as a "strategic investment," which he 
considers critical to the continued success of the BMD 
program.
     O'Neill will provide a written response to the "how much 
do you need" questions from committee members.
Evolving threat guides the program
     He told the committee the pace and direction of the 
advanced technology program is directed at the threat. 
BMDO has identified the most critical technology 
requirements.
     More needs to be done, and could be done with added 
funding, O'Neill said. 
     He ran down a short-list of work that could be 
accomplished with additional money -- doing more on the 
space based-laser program, upgrading power radar 
transmit/receive modules, communicating with interceptors 
in flight over the horizon and advancing interceptor and 
propulsion technology.
     BMDO could also work with Australia on netting long- 
range sensors, a program that now lacks funds. 
     Unique requirements for component support to programs 
such as Patriot, Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, 
AEGIS, ground-based interceptor, ground-based radar and 
the Space and Missile Tracking System. They include:
     ** Sensor and seeker programs to improve range and 
resolution in the areas of: dim objects; low-noise, low-
vibration, 10-year life radiation tolerant; improved
tracking accuracy; countermeasures resistant; and solid-state 
radar modules.
     ** Interceptor components to develop light, fast, smart, 
highly capable long-range missiles that can find small, cold 
targets.
     ** Battle Management, Command, Control and 
Communication high-data and low-error component 
technologies for automated decision aids, data fusion, 
adaptive defense operations and secure communications.
     ** Phenomenology to determine how the threat, 
environment and defensive systems will behave and interact 
during engagement, involving such things as discrimination.
New options for the future
     The advanced concepts work in the technology program 
looks to the future TMD and NMD, creating new options 
such as:
     ** Directed-Energy Boost Phase Intercept -- high payoff 
leap-ahead technology vs. the evolved threat.
     ** Airborne Kinetic Energy Boost Phase Interceptor -- to 
defend against countermeasures and avoid collateral damage.
     ** Innovative Science & Technology and Small Business 
Innovative Research, to accelerate the application of 
breakthrough science.
     Developing technologies to meet these critical 
requirements is essential to maintain the program's 
technology edge, O'Neill said. DoD is not funding basic or 
component BMD technology anywhere else, he added.

Laboratory Notes Starfire Optical Range uses Comet as a 
target

     Air Force Phillips Lab Starfire Optical Range (SOR) will 
use its 3.5 meter telescope, the largest in the DoD, and Laser 
Guide Star technology to get images of Comet Hyakutake as 
it passes the Earth March 25.
     This is not just an astronomy exercise. SOR will use the 
comet as a moving target to further test the Laser Guide Star 
adaptive optics technology.
     The Lab plans to capture computerized photos of the
comet and put them on the Internet for astronomers and the 
general public. Almost immediately after being taken, 
photos will be available through the Internet at   
http://wwwsor.plk.af.mil\.
     Lab officials note weather conditions might prevent them 
from getting images. Phillips' lasers, computers and adaptive 
optics were linked to a 1.5-meter telescope and used to 
eliminate the distorting effects of the atmosphere.
     The Hyakutake Comet approaches Earth at about 36 
miles per second, nearly 130,000 miles per hour, passing us 
within 9.3 million miles.
     The Naval Research Lab's Naval Center for Space 
Technology has developed a mission planning and analysis 
tool for Earth-Orbiting Satellites.
     NRL engineers Jay Middour and Alan Hope and      
AlliedSignal engineer Steven McLaughlin turned the Orbit 
Analysis Tools Software (OATS) into a single integrated 
program that runs on a Mac.
     OATS version 4.0 uses numerical and graphical 
techniques to analyze and display Earth coverage data and 
has the ability to generate satellite ephemerides, using one of 
four orbit propagators.
     A copy of the user's manual for OATS and the OATS 
version 4.0 executable program and related files are available 
on internet via Internet at 
<<http://netmon.nrl.navy.mil/www/oats/oats_welcome.html
>>.
     Los Alamos National Lab offers direct access to near 
real-time data from its Array of Low Energy X-Ray 
Imaging Telescopes (ALEXIS) satellite through a new site 
on the World Wide Web.
     The Web site, <http://nis-www.lanl.gov/nis-
projects/alexis/> allows astronomers to check satellite data 
against observations from the ground.
     ALEXIS was launched nearly three years ago to survey 
the sky for bursts of extreme ultraviolet photons, called 
EUV transients. Scientists want to identify the sources of 
these bursts and learn more about them (SDI Monitor, 
5/7/93).
     The craft scans half the sky with its three paired sets of 
EUV telescopes, but it cannot locate any events with high- 
resolution. 
     Ground-based astronomers, including amateurs and 
students - can take part by looking for visual counterparts to 
the EUV transients seen by ALEXIS by comparing 
observations made at two different times.  
     Large telescopes, with their small fields of view, cannot 
scan a large enough piece of the sky fast enough to 
effectively observe transients seen by ALEXIS, but amateur 
equipment is well suited to the task.
     ALEXIS orbits about 500 miles above Earth, passing 
over Los Alamos four times a day, delivering its collected 
data to a computer at its ground station. The entire system is 
managed by about 10 people.
    The 240-pound, $20 million satellite includes six coffee-
can-sized EUV telescopes with curved multilayer coated 
mirrors that reflect and focus low-energy X-rays the way 
optical telescopes focus visible light (BMDM, 1/28/94).

Industry Review Raytheon to sell Xyplex subsidiary for 
$117.5M

     Raytheon has agreed to sell its Xyplex subsidiary for 
$117.5 million to Whittaker Corp., Simi Valley, Calif.
     When the deal is done Raytheon expects to have an 
ownership position in Whittaker just shy of 20%.
     Xyplex designs, makes, markets and supports solutions 
for distributed client/server Local Area Networks.
     Last year Xyplex's generated about $100 million in 
revenues.
     Raytheon doesn't expect the sale to have any impact on its 
1996 performance. 
     Lockheed Martin Chairman Dan Tellep was named 
California Manufacturer of the Year at a dinner sponsored 
by the California Manufacturers Association Monday night 
in Sacramento this week.
     Governor Pete Wilson presented Tellep with the award 
before  most of the state's top officials and some 100 
legislators.
      Wilson called Tellep "a leader of the state's business 
community and a vital contributor to the regional economy."
     "Under Dan's guidance, Lockheed Martin has 
repositioned itself  from  the Cold War to a leadership role in 
today's emerging new information markets," he said.
      Accepting the award, Tellep said that he was proud and  
appreciative in both a personal sense, having lived in
California for 45 years, and because Lockheed Martin 
continues to maintain a solid presence in the state.
     He noted that since the Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger 
and  the company's pending acquisition of parts of the Loral 
Corporation, Lockheed Martin will continue to be one of 
California's largest private employers.
     "It will probably surprise you to know that today just half  
of business is with the U.S. Department of Defense. We're 
doing more in a broad variety of high technology areas such 
as  information systems in a business that has played such a 
powerful role in California's economic growth.
     Tellep began his career in 1955 as a principal scientist for 
the X-17 missile reentry flight experiments at Lockheed 
Missiles & Space Company.
     At the end of last year, Tellep retired as an active 
employee of Lockheed Martin, but will remain chairman of 
the board through 1996.
      When Tellep retired as CEO, the company announced a 
$1 million endowment for the Daniel M. Tellep  
Distinguished Professorship in the College of Engineering at 
his alma mater, the University of California at Berkeley.
     The House Small Business Committee has discussed the 
future of the Small Business Innovation Research Program 
(SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer 
(STTR) Pilot Program.
     The STTR program will end September 30, unless 
Congress reauthorizes it. 
     During a March 6 hearing, committee members 
questioned the need for STTR, since it is similar to the SBIR 
program. Witnesses urged continuation of both programs, 
which they said were different but complimentary.
     Digital Systems Resources' president Richard Carroll 
said the programs have become "our best and most effective 
alternative in the era of a shrinking U.S. defense budget, 
which has had enormous negative impacts on high-tech 
small businesses."
     In fiscal year 1996, $980 million will be awarded to 
small businesses: $930 million via SBIR, $50 million under 
STTR.
     Thomas G. McInerney, a former Loral vice president and 
retired Air Force general, has been elected president and 
CEO of Business Executives for National Security.
     BENS is a national, nonpartisan organization of business 
and professional leaders. The organization works to engage 
the business community in defense security issues.
     McInerney plans to focus on innovative business 
solutions to improve defense security. 
     "We have too much `tail' and not enough `teeth,'" he said, 
adding "BENS is ideally qualified to help our military fix 
that."
     John Capellupo, president, McDonnell Douglas 
Aerospace, has been named this year's winner of the Navy 
League's Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz Award.
     Capellupo will receive the award at the Navy League's 
Sea-Air-Space Exposition April 3 in Washington.
     He is cited for outstanding contributions to the U.S. 
maritime force.
     Honeywell has signed a letter of intent to acquire Smiths 
Industries' fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) technology and 
products business.
     The acquisition will strengthen Honeywell's FOG 
technology and position it to extend its product offerings.
     Honeywell is a leading developer and maker of optical 
gyro-based products for military and aerospace applications, 
and is developing advanced FOG technology and products 
for new applications.
     Raytheon is negotiating with Army Missile Command 
for Patriot remote launch communications enhancement 
upgrades and long-lead parts and materials.
     The work will support a limited procurement authority 
for the incorporation of improved technology into the Patriot 
Air Defense System.
     Army Space and Strategic Defense Command spent $1.2 
billion on procurement in fiscal year 1995.
      Small disadvantaged business procurement awards 
accounted for $82 million, or 6.7% of the tab.

     Rep. Sonny Montgomery, R-Miss., congratulated 

     Rep. Sonny Montgomery, R-Miss., congratulated 
Lockheed-Martin board chairman Daniel Tellep, who was 
honored last week with the 1996 James Forrestal Memorial 
Award.
     Montgomery inserted Tellep's speech in the March 14 
Congressional Record. 
     Tellep noted his frustrations about defense, but said there 
was room for optimism: "Optimism that we may be on the 
threshold of arresting, if not reversing the protracted decline 
in defense budgets -- and the downsizing and force 
reductions."
     Tellep said now, with the fiscal year 1997 budget, is the 
time to stop the decline in defense; reverse the trend.
     To make it happen, Tellep said there are some immediate 
steps:
     ** Make a better case to the American people on the 
global nature of threats, emphasizing no defense exists 
against ballistic missile attack.
     ** Make defense an issue in the fiscal year 1997 budget 
cycle and the 1996 federal elections.
     ** Reestablish firewalls around the defense budget so it 
isn't a checkbook for the rest of the federal budget.
     ** Spend defense dollars more efficiently, continuing 
acquisition reform, improving the tooth-to-tail ratio and 
shedding excess depot capacity.
     The awards dinner was hosted by the National Security 
Industrial Assn. and the American Defense Preparedness 
Assn.
      A Rutgers University study says Los Angeles can cut 
defense industry losses by reorienting aerospace-related 
manufacturing and emphasizing employee retraining.
     University economists said the LA economy is still 
vulnerable, but ready to move on new initiatives and 
partnerships among private firms, public authorities and 
community and labor groups.
     The defense industry has been shrinking due to 
government cuts, leading to site shutdowns and moves.
     "Los Angeles is an ideal laboratory for experimenting 
with many of these technologies, and the delegation should 
push for links between new programs and conversion 
adjustment efforts," the study notes.
     The study says many defense companies have been able 
to move into other areas, taking their talent and technology 
with them. 
     The study also recommends Los Angeles expand long-
term retraining opportunities for laid-off workers, pooling 
resources, to keep engineering and skilled workers.
     The study notes nearly a third of those who have left 
aerospace since 1989 stopped looking for jobs, left the state 
or are unemployed.
