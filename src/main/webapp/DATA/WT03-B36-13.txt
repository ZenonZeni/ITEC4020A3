CHRISTOPHER CREEK, SONOMA COUNTY--LARRY WALKER LIKES THEIR TWO REDS;
CO-OWNER SUSAN MITCHELL SUGGESTS FOOD PAIRINGS;  THEIR CHARDONNAY,
WHICH WALKER ALSO LIKES, IS AVAILABLE ONLY AT WINERY: 707/433-2001

  If Rhone-style wines go out of favor in the USA, most producers of
syrah, mourvedre, carignane and the like can go back to blending those
rich wines into their other reds.

  But tiny Christopher Creek Winery, just south of Healdsburg, has bet
the farm they bought almost ten years ago on petite sirah and the true
Rhone, syrah, both of which win them numerous medals and much praise.
Except for an acre or so of chardonnay, which is distributed mostly from
the winery, their land is devoted to the two reds.

  Larry Walker recently tasted the wines and recorded co-owner Susan
Mitchell's food suggestions, in the California Visitors Review, a great
weekly magazine, $40 per year from PO Box 92, El Verano, CA 95433, tel.
707/938-3494, fax 938-3674 (they don't have e-mail yet, I guess).

    -- The 1991 syrah, $14, brought forth from Walker's quill "lush;
rich;  dark velvety fruit;  full;  layered."  Susan Mitchell, mother of
the teen-age Christopher for whom the winery is named, says hearty
cassoulet is a great match.

    -- The 1992 syrah, also $14, is big and powerful, Walker says-- but
because of tasty fruit, there's a certain graceful quality about it as
well.  So Ms. Mitchell suggests "a chicken and turkey meatloaf with
garlic mashed potatoes and a green salad."

    -- The 1992 petite sirah runs true to its varietal character --
deeply intense, lots of flavor including a full-flavored finish, and
what Walker calls "meaty tannins" which must mean you can pair it with
some hard-knuckled, hot-tempered foods:  sure enough, here's Ms.
Mitchell suggesting pepperoni pizza!  Maybe next year it'll be perfect
with the grilled steak, prime rib or roast pork loin she also mentioned.

    -- There's a 1994 chardonnay whose oak makes its statement from
"behind" a citrus character.  The wine is "elegant, stylish, poised and
balanced," says Walker, mentioning a winery price of $16.  Food?
Grilled chicken or light pasta dishes.

  If you contact Christopher Creek, ask for their recipes matched to
their wines.  Here's one.

SUSAN'S WINTER POTATO SOUP

      1/4 cup olive oil
        1 medium yellow onion, chopped
        4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
    2-1/2 lbs Yukon gold or red potatoes
        3 cups chicken stock
    Also, freshly-ground pepper and salt to taste
      and sun-dried tomatoes, finely chopped, or fresh Italian parsley,
            finely chopped.

  Saute onions and garlic one to two minutes in heated oil.  Use a
large, heavy pan.  Don't peel potatoes, but wash and cube them and add
them, with the chicken stock, to the pan;  add water as necessary to
cover the potatoes.  Simmer over heat until potatoes are tender, about
20 minutes.  You can serve from the pot, or puree after allowing the
soup to cool a bit.  Use the tomatoes or parsley as garnish atop each
bowl, and accompany it with warm crusty bread and syrah.

'SONOMA ODYSSEY' JUNE 1, 1996--WORTH A VISIT

  Perfectly in tune with the high quality of Sonoma County food and
wine, the gorgeous, even breathtaking scenery, and laid-back exurban
lifestyle of Sonoma County is its off-the-beaten-track (but not far)
Sonoma Odyssey, June 1, 1996.

  From 1 to 5 PM, at Richard's Grove--Saralee's Vineyard, you can meet
food and wine authors, taste premium wines from 30 producers, sample
Mediterranean style foods (Sonoma County is a dead ringer for Tuscany
and a number of other "mid-earth" ambiances), buy new, used and rare
books, and participate in an auction the nature of which-- who knows?

  To get there you go north from Santa Rosa to the River Road exit of US
Highway 101 (the Luther Burbank Center for the Performing Arts dominates
the view here;  you can't miss it) and go west on River Road to Slusser
Road and turn north to number 3375.

  Tickets are $20.  Information from co-sponsor the Sonoma County Wine
Library, PO Box 43, Healdsburg, CA 95448, tel. 707/433-2485.  The other
sponsors are National Public Radio state KRCB-FM and PBS KRCB-TV,
Rohnert Park.

MURPHY-GOODE 1993 SONOMA COUNTY FUME BLANC-- DON'T RUSH OUT TO GET IT
BECAUSE IT'S SOLD OUT, BUT THEIR 1995, $10.50 IS WIDELY AVAILABLE

  The Airport Club, the health facility where our family spends time and
money (too bad the effects don't show on me), has been serving a 1993
Murphy-Goode fume (sauvignon) blanc that's so good I've wanted to write
about it.  I thought I'd wait for their 1995 to show up on the market,
and taste them side by side.  Not really possible.  But a certain house
style will connect the two, I think, and so I'll tell you the 1995 is
available, list price $10.50, and give you the winery phone number, and
let you know what I think you might want to prepare to go with it.

  The '93 probably has just a hint of residual sugar;  I can just about
detect it and my "threshold" is 0.03 percent.  Alcohol is 13 percent and
in a white wine that level in a crisp wine can make it "hot" but I felt
no such effect.

  Delightful lemon and grapefruit with a background hint of tropical
fruit (typical for the Alexander Valley) come through in a wine that's
crisp from start to lemon-zesty finish.  It's so clean it would be
perfect with any dish with a rich white sauce -- perhaps fettucine so
sauced, with seared and braised tuna slices or chunks?  To prepare that
fresh tuna steak, I'd sear it on a bed of course-ground black pepper,
remove it from the hot iron pan, reduce the heat to medium high and
braise it over lemon slices with enough of the fume blanc to come half-
way up the height of the tuna flake;  remove from the pan when it seems
the tuna will just barely begin to flake, and slice or cube it.

  Alternatively you could make a lemon-garlic creamy white sauce (I use
Knudsen non-dairy sour creme for that).
