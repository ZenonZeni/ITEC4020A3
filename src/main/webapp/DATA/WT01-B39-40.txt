<h1>Advice To Little Girls </h1>

<p><b>By Mark Twain, 1865</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>Good little girls ought not to make mouths at their teachers
for every trifling offense. This retaliation should only be
resorted to under peculiarly aggravated circumstances. </p>

<p>If you have nothing but a rag-doll stuffed with sawdust, while
one of your more fortunate little playmates has a costly China
one, you should treat her with a show of kindness nevertheless.
And you ought not to attempt to make a forcible swap with her
unless your conscience would justify you in it, and you know you
are able to do it. </p>

<p>You ought never to take your little brother's
&quot;chewing-gum&quot; away from him by main force; it is better
to rope him in with the promise of the first two dollars and a
half you find floating down the river on a grindstone. In the
artless simplicity natural to his time of life, he will regard it
as a perfectly fair transaction. In all ages of the world this
eminently plausible fiction has lured the obtuse infant to
financial ruin and disaster. </p>

<p>If at any time you find it necessary to correct your brother,
do not correct him with mud - never, on any account, throw mud at
him, because it will spoil his clothes. It is better to scald him
a little, for then you obtain desirable results. You secure his
immediate attention to the lessons you are inculcating, and at
the same time your hot water will have a tendency to move
impurities from his person, and possibly the skin, in spots. </p>

<p>If your mother tells you to do a thing, it is wrong to reply
that you won't. It is better and more becoming to intimate that
you will do as she bids you, and then afterward act quietly in
the manner according to the dictates of your best judgment. </p>

<p>You should ever bear in mind that it is to your kind parents
that you are indebted for your food, and your nice bed, and for
your beautiful clothes, and for the privilege of staying home
from school when you let on that you are sick. Therefore you
ought to respect their little prejudices, and humor their little
whims, and put up with their little foibles until they get to
crowding you too much. </p>

<p>Good little girls always show marked deference for the aged.
You ought never to &quot;sass&quot; old people unless they
&quot;sass&quot; you first.</p>
