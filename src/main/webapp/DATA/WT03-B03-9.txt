WINDS OF EDUCATION: English requires 'professionals'

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By MINORU WADA
Special to Asahi Evening News

Are Japanese teachers seen as professionals? This question has
been vexing me since the Central Council for Education, an
advisory panel to the education minister, submitted the summary
of its discussions on education reforms of the 21st century in
Japan.

Profession is defined in my dictionary as "any type of work
which needs a special training or a particular skill, often one
which is respected because it involves a high level of
education."

Many dictionaries offer "teaching" as a typical example of a
profession. However, I wonder if this definition is taken
seriously by those who advocate the introduction of English at
the elementary school level in Japan.

With respect to the reforms in English education in Japan, the
council has proposed that English should be taught at elementary
schools throughout the country. Naturally, this proposal should
be accompanied by concrete administrative measures to implement
it. The quality of teachers who teach English to elementary
school children is the key to the success of the new proposal.

When you read the education reform summary carefully to know
what the council thinks about this important issue, you will find
a passage which goes like this: "For the purpose of providing
primary school children with the activities that will allow them
get used to English and the life and culture in foreign
countries, it is hoped that the potential of native speakers of
English and that of Japanese people who have had wide experience
living in foreign countries are utilized."

I think this is a great idea. However, it is surprising that
you can find no mention of the roles of Japanese elementary
school teachers who are "professionals" in elementary school
education. I wonder if the council does not expect Japanese
teachers to play an important role in the teaching of English in
elementary school.

A debate arose as to "professionalism" versus "amateurism"
when the Japan Exchange and Teaching Program (JET) was
established about 10 years ago.

In the debate, opponents of JET claimed that only
professionals were qualified to instruct Japanese students, but
those people involved in the debate--from Japanese educators to
assistant English teachers (AET) themselves--agreed that team
teaching of Japanese teachers of English and AETs would be the
best way to make the most of Japanese teachers of English.

What interested me much in the debate was the point that no
amount of theory or experience in an AET's native country was
necessarily effective in a Japanese setting because of the
sometimes conflicting teaching styles between Japanese teachers
and AETs, but what interested me even more was the fact that no
serious discussions were made about "professionalism" of the
Japanese teachers.

When it comes to the teaching at the elementary education
level, you need to pay much more attention to the psychology of
your students, and the psychology is often ingrained in Japanese
culture. I believe that Japanese teachers' role is essential to
the teaching of English in elementary school because they know
their children's behavior, values and so on much better than
people from foreign countries and people who have lived in
foreign countries for a long time.

But the problem with Japanese teachers in elementary school is
that they are not necessarily speakers of English, and because of
that they often have difficulties in communicating with native
speakers of English to whom they should explain the psychology of
Japanese school children.

I strongly believe that those people who advocate the teaching
of English at the elementary level should propose the ways to
solve this problem.

In team-taught English lessons in junior high schools it is
possible for Japanese teachers to give input about their students
to AETs because they are specialized English teachers and can
communicate in English. In team teaching, Japanese teachers can
use their knowledge and ability as "professional" teachers of
English.

Of course, I know quite well that there are communication
problems between Japanese teachers of English and AETs. But
theoretically, Japanese teachers can have the role of designing
and managing their classes by using their professionalism.

Bullying and violent behavior are now raging in schools in
Japan, and it is essential that teachers of any subject as well
as teachers of English learn more about their students' minds.
They should know more about how their students think, feel and
behave in their school life. They need to have more training as
"professionals" who can read the psychology of their children
more than any other people.

I wonder why advocates of the introduction of the teaching of
English do not say anything about this important aspect of
education. Their endeavors to improve English education in Japan
is epoch making. But that makes me wonder all the more why they
want to count so much on native speakers of English and Japanese
who have had the chance to live abroad. I want to know how they
think about Japanese teachers' professional expertise.

University.

EDUCATION: Sankhon grateful for strict upbringing

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Ousmane Sankhon, the public-relations manager of the
Japan-Guinea Association, has become a popular figure on TV talk
shows. A former official with the foreign ministry of Guinea,
Sankhon, 47, worked at the Guinean Embassy in Japan for eight
years beginning in 1972 before becoming a celebrity.

Sankhon said his father, who ran a farm while serving as a
local official, kept strict discipline in his very large family,
discipline he is grateful for.

I was born to a very large family. Altogether it had about 45
members--my father, three mothers, 22 brothers and sisters, and
relatives. In Guinea, such an extended family is not uncommon.

Dad worked on the farm while doing a stint as a local public
servant. He knew everything about his family. He knew how many
chickens we had, when the children got new shoes, how many dishes
there were in the kitchen, and so on.

He was tough with his children, so I feared him very much.
When he was angry he would thrust out his right forefinger. I was
very scared.

I got punished many times because I used to pick fights with
some of my brothers. I was also whipped on the leg or the hips.
It hurt me awfully. Dad had 22 belt whips on the rack at the
front door--one for each of his children

But he was also kind to us. How sweet he looked when he
smiled. Every time I got a good grade report I showed it to him.
"Good boy," he said, and he always bought me a shirt and a pair
of shoes. Dad and I went shopping together, walking hand in hand.
I was very happy.

My father taught me the importance of responsibility. Once,
when I was taking care of the sheep, one of them went astray. I
couldn't have my supper until I found the animal and brought it
home. It was already dark, but I looked for it with the help of
my brothers. I was desperate.

I also worked on the farm. Dad told me to plow a plot of land,
but he left me to do it my way. Sometimes I worked until 8 at
night. I remember the happy moments when I walked home, carrying
a hoe on my shoulder

In Guinea, adults severely scold children for making mischief
even if they are neighbors' children. When a kid has done
something wrong, you take him to his parents, and they always
thank you.

People in Guinea respect families that strictly discipline
their children. Parents with a spoiled child often take him to
such a family so he can live there for a while and change his bad
habits.

My father died when I was in the third grade of middle school.
I like the saying that goes something like this, "Parental advice
and cold sake have a slow effect." I am grateful that Dad was
tough with me. I respected him. I still do.

During a Japanese TV talk show I was on, the MC asked a senior
high school girl what she disliked most about her father. "He
stinks," she said. I was surprised.

I like Japan very much, so let me offer a bit of advice. The
most important thing for children is their families. Working
fathers should go home early. And they should be in good shape
when they get home.

Imagine a father who gets home late every night, drunk and his
tie loose. I wonder what his children would think of him.

EDUCATION: In language-school battle for students, a gentler success

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By KAZUNAGA FUKUSHIMA
Asahi Evening News

As large language schools successfully win more students
through expensive advertising and by opening accessible branches
in expensive locations, more smaller schools are feeling the
squeeze. Some are even being pushed out of business.

But one small English language school is finding a way to
survive in this highly competitive environment by offering
something many of the larger, profit-oriented schools
don't--quality of education.

Quest 21, which provides language courses designed to suit
individual needs, was opened near JR Kichijoji Station in April
by some former teachers of Sony Language Laboratory (SLL) after
that school became one of the casualties of the fierce battle for
students.

SLL, which was a pioneer among language schools in this
country after it was started in 1962 by Sony Corp.'s subsidiary
Sony Enterprise, was sold to other schools in March. A Sony
Enterprise spokesman said SLL faced ballooning deficits in recent
years as more students were wooed by new schools with big
advertising campaigns.

Teachers became concerned that the takeover of SLL by other
schools, which was announced in February, would mean a departure
from the school's original teaching methods and materials.

After unsuccessfully petitioning Sony Enterprise to continue
running SLL, a group of the teachers decided to open Quest 21 to
maintain an education policy of placing priority on individual
needs.

Quest 21 produces courses of study for individual students who
have specific purposes in mind when they want to learn English,
said Duane Sturm, a former SLL teacher and now president of Quest
21.

For example, when a housewife said she wanted to master
English in a short period of time in accordance with her specific
needs and ability, the school prepared lessons to meet her
schedule.

In another case, responding to a request by a mother who has a
disabled son and who wants to attend international conferences
for the disabled, the school held a lecture on words and
expressions that are often encountered in such occasions.

Unlike most language schools, Quest 21 hasn't adopted a
flex-time system, in which schools sell students a large number
of lessons in a package deal. As such deals usually require
advanced payment, schools can secure longer-term financial
stability. However, the advance payment system is often cause for
conflicts when students want to quit the school and demand
refund.

Quest 21 collects tuition fees based only on three-month
semester. Kunitsugu Noritake, a former SLL student and one of the
founders of Quest 21, said financial stability is attainable even
without advance payments.

"If the human relationship between students and teachers is
solid, students won't quit the school," he said.

He said the school expects students who appreciate the school
to bring in other students. Some come to take advantage of the
excellent teachers.

For example, one student returned to the school because of the
enthusiasm of her teacher, Patricia Sturm, wife of Duane and
another founding member of Quest 21.

"The reason why I come to Quest 21 is to want to be taught by
Mrs. Patricia," she said. "She has a technique which induces the
attendants to spontaneously speak their opinion in English."

The student said she likes the teacher's interest in using
newspapers and magazines as teaching material.

The students at Quest 21 have an opportunity to freely
exchange opinions with teachers during discussion class, for
which students get to choose the theme.

Then the teachers at Quest 21 clip the articles relating to
the themes from magazines and newspapers to encourage attendants
to aggressively discuss issues.

For instance, in a recent class, eight housewives who are
students selected euthanasia as the topic for discussion.

Quest 21 is also well-known because its teaching method works
well for students who have returned from abroad. Returning
students tend to lose their positive attitude toward speaking and
discussing in English because of cultural conflicts, said

Patricia Sturm.

She encourages returnees to maintain and improve their
positive attitude through discussion with other students who have
the same experience of having lived overseas.

But questions about whether such a cost-inefficient school can
sustain itself remain.

Noritake says Quest 21 needs 60 more students than the 90 it
currently has for a stable operation.

"But," he said, "we don't insist on profits. Rather, we expect
Quest 21 to be recognized as a non-profit educational foundation
in the future."

Duane Sturm agrees.

"Although it isn't easy to keep running Quest 21, we want to
keep providing student-oriented education," he said.

Fake budget report wastes \13 million

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

A statistics office in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries submitted a false explanation in seeking a 13
million yen budget allocation for a new machine, well-placed
sources said.

A funding request based on the false explanation has already
been incorporated into the ministry's fiscal 1997 budget request.

The office in the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau's
Statistics and Information Department wants the new device to
replace one it now uses to enhance work efficiency in its
troublesome task of calculating the rice harvest index.

But the 13 million yen request was made in the name of other
products, since the device sought by the statistics office has
not yet been developed and thus the funding item was not likely
to pass muster. The office was planning to ask a manufacturer to
develop a pilot model after obtaining the 13 million yen.

Officials in the office now admit that the request is a
violation of procurement rules, and said that they will use the
funds in the budget request to purchase the products specified.

But those products are, in fact, not needed, representing a
waste of public money. "We wanted to promote a plan as fast as
possible," said an official.

in the office. "Because it came to light, we decided to buy
the products that we requested, although taxpayers' money will be
wasted."

BUSINESS: INTERVIEW: TAIKI SAITO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, YAMAICHI: RESEARCH
INSTITUTE

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Domestic economic ripples from the U.S. election

By AMY SHIRATORI
Asahi Evening News

Q: Do you think U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposed
economic policies would be effective?

A: If the Republicans retain control of Congress, Clinton's
efforts would be blocked, and no policy change would come about.

The budget deficit would inch down, but not disappear in 2002
as Clinton says. The financial markets have already taken this
scenario into account.

Q: How effective do you think Republican candidate Bob Dole's
economic policies would be?

A: Dole's proposed policies would work only if the Republicans
have full control of Congress. If the Democrats control Congress,
Dole might compromise with them in a detrimental way, agreeing to
accept spending to protect low-income people because his proposed
tax cuts would benefit the middle to upper class.

I don't think Dole will get elected for proposing an income
tax cut.

Ordinary citizens did not look favorably on the debate to
balance the budget earlier this year, because they knew that
Republican-proposed tax cuts benefit the rich mostly.

Republicans and the supply-side economists always exaggerate
the scope of economic growth resulting from a tax cut, and the
cut would not bring about a balanced budget by 2002.

The capital gains tax cut proposed by both Clinton and Dole is
not looked on favorably either because people realize it needs to
be balanced by cuts in medical welfare.

Q: Which candidate's becoming president will benefit Japan?

A: It would be best if the status quo is maintained. It is
uncertain what a Republican president would do. Republicans are
proponents of free trade, but past Republican presidents have
taken a tough trade stance.

Democrats espouse protectionist policies and press Japan to
open up its market, but Japan's trade balance is dropping, and it
can hardly be said anymore that the U.S. trade deficit is caused
solely by Japan.

I think the trade surplus will continue to drop although the
rate of decline will slow down. The yen will average 105 yen to
113 yen in six months.

Q: Would the adoption of Clinton's proposals lead to slow U.S.
growth?

A: I estimate the economic growth between July and September
to be between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. But I project economic
growth between October and December will dip below 2 percent, and
that for the first half of next year it will be under 1 percent.

The U.S. economy shows both strength and underlying weakness.
The strength is that corporations have completed their inventory
adjustments, so they can easily increase production.

But consumption, particularly for durable goods and housing,
will not increase further. This is because the long-term interest
rate increased 1 percent from the beginning of the year, and
expansion has already lasted for 5! years.

Another point is that past consumption was made by borrowing
money, and households need to adjust their balance sheets.

Finally, the layoff of people hired in conjunction with the
Atlanta Olympics and the end of Olympic-related construction will
squeeze down on private demand. But I don't think the United
States will enter a recession.

The Fed can easily loosen its monetary policy because unlike
in the past recovery phase, prices have not been rising.
Expansion will pick up again in the latter half of next year.

Q: Is it unlikely that the Fed will raise interest rates?

A: That's not clear, because mixed indicators showing both a
strong and weak economy will be reported. I think there is a 70
percent chance that the Fed will not raise the federal funds rate
this year.

But the Fed might raise the rate as a preventive measure
against inflation at the next Federal Open Market Committee
meeting Sept. 24 if a strong index is reported. Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan is a Republican, so he does not have to feel reluctant
to raise rates before the election.

But Greenspan will not raise the federal fund rate in October
or November because that would be seen as a political move.

Q: What will be the effect on the economy if the Democrats
take charge of Congress?

A: The Democrats are now becoming favorites to win in the
House.

The current economic growth has been brought about because of
corporate restructuring. Corporations have been reinvigorated,
but private individuals have not, and their dissatisfaction has
worked to the advantage of the Democratic Party, which has
patronized the middle and lower class.

Democrats controlling Congress would tend to increase welfare
spending for these people, and blunt efforts to reduce the budget
deficit. The market has a deep distrust of a Democratic Congress.
There will be a triple downward spiral of falling stocks, bonds
and the dollar.

Q: Should Japan raise interest rates or compile a
supplementary budget for more fiscal stimulus?

A: Japan will not raise interest rates in September or October
even if the U.S. Fed raises the rate, because of the weak Tankan
report on business confidence in an economic recovery last week.

Japan should do no more than to increase the call rate late in
the year, if necessary, and provide another 2 trillion yen
construction spending boost in a supplementary budget, which I
think the government will do.

This is necessary to offset a 5 trillion yen tax increase from
the consumption tax hike next April.

National Briefs

Music star falsely declared taxes

Tetsuya Komuro, a musical impresario living in Tokyo's Minato
Ward, filed a modified income tax return after the Tokyo Regional
Taxation Bureau found he had failed to correctly report income of
about 110 million yen earned in fiscal 1994, tax officials said.

The 37-year-old producer and composer had reported the 110
million yen income, including royalties on compact discs he had
produced, as business income of his company, Tetsuya Komuro
State, instead of personal income.

The tax officials ruled the amount as Komuro's taxable
personal income because he had not transferred the copyrights of
the CDs to the company.

Komuro composed and produced some popular songs, for singer
Ryoko Shinohara and other musicians, which became million sellers
in 1994. He declared the royalties on the songs as his company's
income.

Girl dies while crossing tracks

A 12-year-old girl who went out Sunday night to find her
missing cat was killed when she entered a level crossing and was
hit by a train, police said.

Ayako Kume, a student at Higashi Elementary school in
Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture, had left home saying, "I'll look
for my cat," according to her father Seiichi, 47.

The area is serviced by the JR Minobu Line.

Climbers tumble to their deaths

A rock climber died after falling Sunday from the
Ichinokura-sawa cliff face on Tanigawa-dake mountain in Minakami,
Gunma Prefecture, police said.

The dead climber was identified by police as Kozo Murotani,
43, a designer living in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo. Murotani was
climbing the cliff with a friend Sunday morning when he
apparently slipped and fell about 100 meters, police said.

Ichinokura-sawa is one of the most popular rock-climbing
cliffs in the nation and was crowded throughout the weekend,
police said.

In a separate accident, another cliff scaler died Saturday
evening on Machihodo-sawa of Koidemata-yama, a mountain in the
Tanigawa Range, in Niiharu, Gunma Prefecture, police said.

The dead man was identified by police Masanori Ito, 36, a
Kawasaki city official living in Aoba Ward, Yokohama.

Company officials found dead

The president and the director of an Osaka-based company were
found dead in the company's reception room Sunday evening, police
said.

Yasuo Hiyane, 60, president of Oyasu-Yosetsu Kogyo-sho, a
welding shop of Toyonaka City, Osaka, killed himself by taking
poison after bludgeoning to death Hideharu Matsumoto, 52, the
firm's director, police said. Their bodies were found by the
president's wife.

According to police, Matsumoto was found lying face down. He
apparently had been hit by a blunt weapon that left a bruise on
his head, police said. Hiyane's body was leaning on a chair with
a bottle of medicine beside him. Hiyane's body showed no sign of
being hit, police said.

Hashimoto hesitant on ekection date

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Sunday that he will
decide in the middle of this month the dates for convening an
extraordinary Diet session and for dissolving the Lower House for
an election.

The main issue before the extraordinary Diet session will be a
supplementary budget.

Hashimoto said he will decide the political schedules after
learning the results of Okinawa Prefecture's Sunday referendum on
a reduction of U.S. military bases and for a report on the
April-June gross domestic product (GDP) to be released in
mid-September.

Hashimoto revealed his plans during separate talks with Koichi
Kato, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
and Finance Minister Wataru Kubo.

Kato told Hashimoto that the LDP is divided over whether there
should be an early dissolution of the Lower House.

Hashimoto and Kubo agreed to cautiously consider the need for
a supplementary budget after they learn the result of the GDP
report.

Hashimoto had said earlier that he would call an extraordinary
Diet session in October to discuss a supplementary budget and
other issues. But he seems to have changed his mind for fear that
an extra session would lead to an immediate dissolution of the
Lower House.

If the extraordinary session is called, the ruling coalition
will face fierce attacks from opposition parties on next April's
hike in the consumption tax from 3 percent to 5 percent, and
allegations that Kato recieved a questionable donation from
now-defunct steel maker Kyowa Co.

The main opposition party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) says
it will submit a bill in the extraordinary session to keep the
consumption tax rate at its current 3 percent.

Shinshinto members also say that unless Kato resigns his post
as LDP secretary-general they will boycott all deliberations in
the extraordinary Diet session.

Sasebo dockyard row flares again

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

A six-month-old agreement that ended a heated dockyard dispute
between a Japanese shipbuilder and the U.S. Navy at the port of
Sasebo in Nagasaki Prefecture is threatening to unravel because
of ship repair regulations.

SSK (Sasebo Heavy Industries Co.) agreed in February to end
its opposition to the U.S. Navy's plan to use free-of-charge the
company's No. 3 drydock to repair a warship after the navy hired
the company to do the work.

But negotiations over the terms of the contract for the work
on Bellow Wood, an amphibious assault ship, broke down when the
navy insisted that the company follow American
regulations--including those governing working conditions--when
doing the repairs.

"The U.S. forces have the mentality of the post-war Occupation
Forces," said SKK President Ryutaro Hasegawa. "No. 3 Dock will be
taken away (from our control) little by little."

On Thursday, hundreds of company union members held a rally at
the dockyard, surrounding the 900-meter circumference No. 3 dock
in a human chain to protest the planned repair work on the Bellow
Wood at the dock.

A 1968 agreement between SSK, the Japanese government and the
United States gives U.S. forces priority in using the drydock at
no charge, on just seven days' notice. SKK assumed control of the
dock from the Japanese government in the same year.

Tension erupted between the company and the U.S. forces in
mid-January when the navy requested the use of the drydock to do
seven months' of repair work on the Bellow Wood.

The company argued that it would lose about 36 billion yen of
its income if the dock was occupied for such a long period.

"I have always been pro-American. In emergencies, we will help
U.S. forces. But in normal times, we don't welcome something that
will send the company into bankruptcy," said Hasegawa.

The issue was considered settled when the U.S. Navy agreed to
contract the repair work on Bellow Wood to SSK, with the terms of
the work to be decided by the company, Hasegawa said.

Bacteria facilities barely coping

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

The nation's two storage facilities for bacilli samples are so
ancient and understaffed that future epidemics of bacterial
infection will be hard to contain, bacteriologists say.

Bacteria samples are necessary for determining the cause of
infection and studying methods of treatment, as well as for
understanding their genetic composition.

But they are stored at only two places in Japan--Tokyo
University and Osaka University.

Directors of these facilities complain that little has been
done over the years to improve these storage areas.

"There's been no progress so far," said professor Takeshi
Honda, the director of the Osaka University facility. "If the
present situation is allowed to continue, I must say that the
next time there is an outbreak, researchers may not be able to
come up with timely solutions to contain it."

The two facilities are run on an Education Ministry budget
that can hardly be called generous--a very lean 1.2 million yen a
year for Tokyo and slightly over 800,000 yen for Osaka, the
bacteriologists say.

And the ministry recognizes only one full-time researcher
each.

The Tokyo University storage facility occupies a corner of a
research wing dating back to the late 1920s. The tiny,
16.5-square-meter space holds refrigerators and freezers that are
crammed with test tubes containing 500 kinds of germs, including
O-157, salmonella, cholera, tuberculosis and dysentery bacteria.

Following the massive O-157 food poisoning epidemic, the
facility provided about 10 research institutes of food makers in
the Kanto area with samples of this E. coli bacillus.

But with its meager operating budget, inadequate equipment and
the barest skeleton staff, the outfit is a far cry from its much
more developed British, German and American counterparts, the
bacteriologists say.

For this reason, many Japanese researchers send for samples
from overseas institutes.

"Unlike the American facility at Maryland, which publishes a
catalogue of several thousand strains of bacteria and supplies
samples to researchers around the world, we are unable to even
meet all domestic requests for samples," lamented professor Shiro
Kanegasaki, director of the Tokyo University facility.

"And our freezers are ancient, `vintage' affairs," he said.
"We have to haul in tons of dry ice whenever there is a power
outage."

The situation is no better at the Osaka University facility
which mainly stores E. coli bacilli.

"We've had to discard some samples for lack of storage space,"
Honda said.

Some researchers have appealed to the Health and Welfare
Ministry to create bacteria sample storage facilities and
pertinent information services of the European and American
caliber, but the ministry has "no immediate plans for action," a
ministry official said.

In addition, Honda of Osaka University has been trying to
persuade the Education Ministry to upgrade the existing
facilities.

In recent years, bacteriology has been steadily overtaken by
virology, according to Kanegasaki. In 1977, 56 of 80 medical
schools around the nation taught bacteriology. Today, the course
is offered at less than half of those schools.

"The declining status of bacteriology as a branch of medical
science has definitely to do with the present plight of our
facility and Osaka University's," Kanegasaki said.

COMMENTARY: Politics lost for weords

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By YOICHI FUNABASHI
Asahi Shimbun

CHICAGO--After covering the Republican National Convention in
San Diego and the Democratic National Convention here, I am sick
and tired of speeches. I feel as though I made the trips to cover
speech contests.

The conventions were held to nominate the presidential
candidates of the two parties but a succession of speakers
preceded the nominees, Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton, to
the rostrum. Most of their speeches were partisan, just battering
the opposition. Could they really be called speeches?

The speakers' words were packaged with audio-visual effects.
During a speech on crime, a rape victim stepped onto the podium
and talked about the horrors she had experienced, interrupting
the speech like a television commercial.

Other speakers waded into the audience like talk-show hosts.
Giant screens made hilarious exchanges between speaker and
audience possible.

At a time when music and videos are packaged to sell products
and people, it may not be strange that speeches are "packaged"
like music videos. Does this mean that the karaoke machine is now
an essential part of giving a speech?

These gimmicks, I suspect, are causing a qualitative
deterioration in speeches, weakening the power of words.

In the interest of playing up the appearance of party unity,
both parties scheduled speeches that deviated from the "scripted"
party line only at times when the major national networks would
not air them.

While shortened speeches were a welcome phenomenon, there was
a quid pro quo: a preponderance of slogans like bumper stickers.
And there were too many tear-jerking stories.

Yet some speeches were moving. Colin Powell, former chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urged Republicans to be magnanimous
to those with whom they disagree. Based on his own experience,
Senator John McCain portrayed Dole as a "quiet hero" who went
about his work silently. Despite his disagreement with Clinton on
welfare, the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave a sermon on why he should be
supported in his reelection bid.

My overall impression is still that too many words were used
at the conventions. But I attribute the torrential verbiage to
the conviction that "politics are a matter of persuasion," and
persuasion primarily depends on words.

Exactly the opposite is true of Japanese politics. But this is
neither laudable nor tasteful. The Japanese machismo along the
lines of the well-known TV commercial catchphrase--"A man
silently drinks such-and-such beer"--is nothing but an expression
of distrust in words and reason.

During the Morihiro Hosokawa administration, Teiichi Tanigaki,
a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, attacked the prime
minister for his flip-flops over his proposal to replace the
consumption tax with a national welfare tax.

Speaking in a Lower House plenary session, Tanigaki said,
"When politicians are lost for words, power of speech, they have
no choice but to rely on muscles and money. Don't you think a
fascistic `muscle power' mode of politics is holding sway?"

The accusation was to the point. But the same thing can be
said of the present coalition government of Liberal Democrats,
Social Democrats, and Sakigake.

Remarks made by government and coalition officials over the
planned 2-percent increase in the consumption tax to 5 percent
next April are so divergent that they make one wonder which of
them is true. What strikes me is that the government and the
coalition are lost for words.

It seems that in Japan, words lack even the frail lifespan of
ice cream.

The approach of the next Lower House election under the
single-seat constituency system makes the political aphasia--the
loss of ability to use or understand words-- all the more
worrying for party politics in Japan.

The single-seat system has been adopted on the premise that it
will force voters to choose between parties, which will have to
spell out their differences in policies and in the leadership
capacity of their presidents. It is a system that works only when
parties vie with words.

Japanese politicians should give more speeches. I do not care
whether they act like talk-show hosts or employ a karaoke
machine.

In fact, under the present circumstances, I cannot afford to
care for the quality of speeches. I call for--no, I plead for--a
speech contest among the parties in Japan.

Matsumoto told to pay \790 million for gassing

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

The Tokyo District Court this morning ordered Aum Shinrikyo
founder Chizuo Matsumoto and other two cult leaders to pay 790
million yen in damage compensation to victims of the cult's Tokyo
subway sarin attack last year and to their families.

Presiding judge Hisashi Yamazaki said the three should be
regarded as having tacitly admitted to their involvement in the
gassing, because they failed to challenge the plaintiffs' claim
that they ordered and conducted the attack.

Although Matsumoto, 41, known as Shoko Asahara, had refused to
answer whether he admitted the same allegation in a criminal
trial, the civil court today said that he was the mastermind of
the subway attack.

The sarin nerve gas attack on March 20, 1995, killed 12 and
sickened 5,500.

Those ordered to pay compensation along with Matsumoto were
Ikuo Hayashi, 49, the former head of the sect's self-designed
"Treatment Ministry," and Masami Tsuchiya, 31, the former head of
the "Chemical Division."

Hayashi has admitted his involvement in the gassing, while
Tsuchiya opted to remain silent when accused.

Twenty-two people who were sickened in the gassing and 16
bereaved family members of seven who died filed the suit to seek
790 million yen in damages from the three and 12 others.

Matsumoto, Hayashi and Tsuchiya and 12 other Aum members.

Three of the other 12 named in the suit are still fugitives.

The civil suit will be considered settled when any of the 15
accused pay the money.

Matsumoto had already been ordered to pay over 360 million yen
in compensation in other damage suits related to crimes allegedly
caused by the sect, and in refund of donations the sect had
accepted from followers.

Matsumoto is believed to have little private assets, and has
so far paid only 650,000 yen out of 10 million yen demanded by
one group of plaintiffs in refund of their donations to Aum.

Hurt Akebono at a crossroads

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By JOHN De BELLIS
Asahi Evening News

If you consider Akebono's 12-3 record at the Nagoya tournament
in July after six months of crippling injuries, you begin to
understand that this is a man who is capable of beating the odds.

The 27-year-old Hawaiian-born yokozuna defied probability by
blazing through the ranks of Japan's most traditional sport. But
becoming the first non-Japanese to reach the sport's pinnacle was
arduous, and now he suffers the pain to substantiate it.

Injuries have put his longevity in doubt. His knees, on which
he had surgery in 1993, are the main problem. Too often, they
have given way beneath his 204-centimeter, 224-kilogram frame.

"When I was on the rise, I thought I was invincible," Akebono
said, flashing a smile that seemed to fade with the realization
that his career could be cut short. "I am also at the point that
if I get over this wall, it will decide my future, how long I do
sumo," he said quietly. "I want to be yokozuna for 10 years."

But as Akebono--formerly Chad Rowan and now a naturalized
Japanese citizen--prepares for the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament,
which begins next Sunday, there are doubts as to whether his body
can continue to endure the punishment it has absorbed during his
eight years in sumo.

His Hawaiian-born stable master, Azumazeki--formerly Jesse
Kuhaulua--has some concerns about his protege's training methods.

"He struggles because he doesn't work on his shiko (sumo-style
leg stomps for developing the lower body) more," Azumazeki said.
"If he does that, I think he can stay on top another four or five
years.

"You need shiko to succeed. It gives you balance and helps you
dig. Look at Konishiki. His size is tremendous (274 kilograms),
but he still does his shiko practice. That's why he's lasted so
long."

When Akebono pulled out of the January tournament on the
fourth day, he began to realize his mortality. The explosiveness
was gone from his tachiai (charge), so he was unable to attain
proper balance.

"When you get hurt in one place, you tend to favor that spot,
and then other things begin to be affected," Akebono said.

In March, he decided to skip the spring tournament because of
lingering pain in his knees and ankles. And it was painful--both
figuratively and literally--for him to watch his career slowing
to a halt.

"Many athletes who are at the top of their sport go through
trials," Akebono said, admitting that he has entertained
self-doubts and considered a world in which he could not wake up
each day and know he was the best. "I was doing so well after I
became yokozuna; I thought that nothing could stop me."

But that perception was shattered. Now, questions swirl around
his mind. Is retirement near? "Sometimes I think about it, but
not every day," he said. "I'd get stressed out."

If it weren't for the bad knees, it could be like it was
before--massive arms pumping and thrusting, opponents landing in
the third row.

"It frustrates me," Akebono said. "You think about things that
you would never consider if you weren't hurt."

But he said he believes he will overcome the injuries. And
even get better. "When I was hurt, I studied my sumo on video. I
still watch videos. I watch them to improve my techniques."

An avid Internet surfer, Akebono occasionally comes across
sumo interviews and analyses, or reads them in newspapers. Some
of them question his future.

"I don't really pay attention to that," Akebono said. "What
people see, and the person doing it, are two different things. I
haven't been shining like before, but I think, deep down inside,
that if I keep pushing, it will come back."

By the time Akebono entered the dohyo for the Tokyo summer
tournament in May, he was learning how to wrestle with pain. He
racked up a respectable 10-5 record and began to feel that
returning to top form was truly possible.

By Nagoya, Akebono was again dominating opponents. He went
12-3. "I thought I was going to take the whole thing," he said.
"But on the 14th day I hurt my shoulder."

He regards that injury as nothing more than a bump on the road
to recovery. "Right now my timing is off and I still feel pain in
my shoulder," Akebono said, "but if I keep practicing hard, I
should be ready."

MY FAVORITE HOME PAGE: Motor Link Page

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

"Just like many other freelance writers, I use this home page
when I need to check some detailed facts about automobiles when I
face a deadline," said magazine columnist Kazuhisa Kimura.

The Motor Link Page is divided into sections representing 18
major car makers from all over the world--five Japanese and 13
foreign.

If you click, for example, on the Nissan section, you can see
not only the home page of the firm but also the home pages of its
overseas subsidiaries.

In the site for Mercedes Benz, visitors can see
personally-produced pages on the manufacturer's vehicles as well
as its official Web site.

Kimura, a great lover of cars, accesses the Motor Link Page
quite often to update his knowledge about Italian, German and
other countries' cars. He came across the home page, while
surfing on the Internet.

"The home page is useful to get new information about foreign
cars, as well as their specifications--especially when I don't
have much time to check my facts before deadline," the writer
said, adding that the site is also fun visually.

However, Kimura said the quality and quantity of information
provided by the home page needs some improvement in some fields
in order to become on a par with popular Western auto magazines.

It's been about a year since he started to use the Internet
for professional and hobby-related purposes. His first encounter
with the Internet came at an Internet cafe, he said.

BOOKS: A marriage of religions

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By AKIO OGAWA
Asahi Evening News

While many Japanese still bow and pray in front of their
shrines and temples, many take the origins of these rituals for
granted--as if the mystery of religion is timeless.

Before Buddhism arrived in 538 A.D. via China and Korea, Japan
was a land of kami (a variety of indigenous, almost-animistic
Shinto deities), and school textbooks tell us what happened since
then--coexistence of Shintoism and Buddhism.

But these same texts largely fail to explain how and why this
remarkable merger took place in the first place.

Akio Yoshie, a history professor at the University of Tokyo,
tries to fill in the void using language understandable to laymen
in his latest book, "Shinbutsu Shugo (Merger of Shintoism and
Buddhism, Iwanami Shoten, 650 yen).

The history starts with what is called the Yamato Court,
Japan's first central authority, which consolidated its rule in
the mid-seventh century, and, in the early eighth century, its
rulers had two of Japan's first historical books compiled. The
books depicted the ruling family as the descendants of
mythological Shinto kami from heaven.

In those days, the court's rulers doubled as the highest
Shinto priests. As such, they ruled over various clan leaders,
village chieftains and grassroots villagers who believed in the
variety of kami. Clan leaders and village chieftains also had
similar double roles in their communities.

In other words, the original Shinto was the backbone of the
Yamato Court's rule.

But Yoshie points out in his book that a strange thing
happened from the eighth to ninth century--the mushrooming of
jingu-ji, or Buddhist temples in and around Shinto shrine
precincts.

Why, according to Yoshie, has to do with the production of
rice.

During the Nara era (710-794), the rice production increased
by leaps and bounds, thanks to fast expanding irrigation networks
and newly reclaimed paddy fields.

The change produced a wide economic gap between the local
government officials and country rulers and the villagers and
farm hands. The wealthy feared reprisals from the poor, and at
the same time they felt a strong sense of guilt.

Against this backdrop, Yoshie says, the uneasy rich sought
comfort and salvation from Buddhism, a religion of tolerance, by
building the jingu-ji.

The central rulers, who were also the highest kami priests,
had no choice but to leave Buddhism and the jingu-ji since their
own local heads were among the newly converted.

According to Yoshie, this was the first stage in the curious
mixing of Shintoism and Buddhism.

The second stage began with tales of ghosts and disasters that
struck the imperial palace, killing noblemen and terrifying
emperors to death. These events during the early part of the
Heian era (794-1195) were recorded in various documents in the
ninth and early 10th centuries.

The most famous ghost was that of Sugawara-no-Michizane
(845-903), a top nobleman-politician who lost in a power struggle
and died in exile in Kyushu.

Social unrest characterized this period as Emperor Uda
(867-931) and Emperor Daigo (885-930) in particular tried to
consolidate the imperial dynasty again by reasserting imperial
ownership of the nation's land that had been mainly privatized a
century earlier.

Bloody power struggles

This and other maneuvers by the emperors triggered power
struggles, sometimes bloody ones, in Kyoto. The social unrest
coincided with the burgeoning of the samurai who opposed to the
imperial rule.

That was where the Buddhist monks--especially, the esoteric
ones who were steadily building up their influence--hopped in.

They presided over one prayer session after another in many
parts of the country on the pretext of ridding the nation of the
ghosts and evils they blamed for the disasters. In reality,
however, they were fanning the social unrest.

At the peak of the disorder, Yoshie argues, Taira-no-Masakado
(?-940), a samurai leader, seized power in the Kanto region and
proclaimed himself an emperor in 939.

The emperors reacted by trying to soothe and overcome the
ghost of Sugawara-no-Michizana, which they saw as the symbol and
cause of the social unrest.

They hosted their own prayer sessions. For almost 30 years,
they also paid repeated tributes and contributions to the
Anraku-ji Temple that took care of the exiled nobleman's tomb in
Kyushu and to Kyoto's Kitano Shrine which was dedicated to his
soul.

During that time, samurai and Buddhist monks gradually changed
their strategy, realizing that it was easier to expand their
influence by joining hands with the imperial palace rather than
rebelling against it. This concluded the second stage.

In the third stage in the development of the religious
coexistence, the imperial rulers and noblemen along with their
courtiers and ladies-in-waiting began to practice their own
religion more vigorously, "sharpening their sense of purity"
which is the overriding concern in Shinto.

Ironically, however, the sharpened sense of purity paved the
way for the ruling class to ardently subscribe to the Buddhist
belief in Jodo, or the utopian "Pure Land beyond the Western
Ocean," by the end of the 10th century.

The development, writes Yoshie, was a new stage of coexistence
or rather integration between Shintoism and Buddhism.

In the further evolution of the integration or the fourth
stage, Buddhist theologians tried to absorb Shintoism beginning
in the late Heian era (the late 12th century) with a new theory.
Under this theory, all Shinto deities were interpreted as
incarnations of a variety of Buddhist deities, including Bosatsu
(bodhisattva).

Yoshie points out that the new theory turned out to be a great
success. Most shrines throughout the country had accepted it by
the middle of the Kamakura era (1185-1333). Even the deities at
the Ise Shrine at the top of the imperial Shinto hierarchy
followed suit.

Why the success? Yoshie explains that the emerging samurai
class (the Kamakura government was the first samurai regime)
sought Buddhist theories that pardoned killing--the job of the
samurai--over the Shinto's emphasis on purity. The newly emerging
merchant class also preferred Buddhist theories that preached
equality for all since the controlling samurai class at the time
began establishing a strictly hierarchical society.

The book ends with what Yoshie calls the fourth stage of the
integration during which Buddhism gained the upper hand.

But from where Yoshie's book leaves off, the relationship
continued to go through further twists, some violent.

Nationalistic Shinto theories developed during the Edo era and
ultimately culminated during the Meiji Restoration in the
establishment of the State Shinto where the religion again
centered around the imperial family.

Consequently, the Japanese today bow in front of many shrines
dedicated to original kami and not incarnations of the Buddhist
deities.

Many questions remain about what happened to the complicated
marriage of Shinto and Buddhism after Yoshie's so-called fourth
stage.

The author would do well to provide some answers with a sequel
to this well-researched and informative book.

FEATURE: Lack of water-safety education taking its toll

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By LILY MATSUBARA
Asahi Evening News

Every year, July first marks the beginning of the National
Police Agency's (NPA) annual ritual of tallying up the casualties
of summer leisure.

And every year, the Japanese newspapers' faithful devotion to
a three-inch column on the death toll hardly raises an eyebrow.
They pass for mere statistics. Nothing more, nothing less. And
tragically, nothing learned.

Most of these leisure-activity accidents occur at sea, about
twice as many as in the mountains. An average of 2,000 cases of
water-related accidents are annually filed with the NPA (compared
to 1600 mountaineering accidents). Of these, 1300 result in
deaths. And approximately 200 children die each summer.

But despite these grim statistics, the Ministry of Education's
guidelines on physical education classes do not include practical
lessons in water safety.

While children are all taught to swim freestyle and
breaststroke for at least 25 meters by the time they reach junior
high school, they are not instructed on the fundamental
principles of water safety or told of the many dangers of
swimming in the sea.

"In elementary school, teachers brought us outside to the
(public) roads to teach us about road safety," said Masahiko
Kobayashi, Secretary-General of the Japan Life-Saving
Association. "There are no similar practical lessons in water
safety when it comes to swimming lessons in schools."

According to the NPA, 45 percent of water related accidents
occur in the sea while only 2.3 percent occur in swimming pools.
Another 31 percent of the accidents occur in rivers.

"Those involved in accidents at sea are either swept away by
the tide and undercurrents or get caught in the wave and drown,"
said Kobayashi. "There are even cases of people being swept away
by their floaters because of high winds."

The NPA says most, if not all, accidents are avoidable.

"Even when bad weather causes an accident at sea, it is still
an avoidable problem," said a spokesman for the NPA. "There are
always announcements on weather conditions, and it is up to you
to heed them or not."

Carelessness

Both Kobayashi and the NPA point out that ultimately, personal
indiscretion is the cause of death. The rules are simple --if you
drink or feel unwell, don't swim; look out for coming waves; be
aware of tides and undercurrents; don't use floaters at sea in
high winds.

But, as simple as they seem, the rules still need to be
taught.

"Schools in close vicinity to the sea might have practical
lessons in water safety. But for now, we do not have plans to
include compulsory personal survival skills in our curricula
guideline," said Nobuyuki Ikeda at the Education Ministry's
Physical Education Department.

According to Kobayashi, this problem is compounded by the fact
that there are only 2,500 accredited lifeguards--officially
certified by the Japan Life-Saving Association--spread over just
50 of Japan's 1,400 beaches. The rest of the lifeguards are made
up of uncertified high school students and local residents
working at summer jobs.

In Australia, where life-saving is well established, the ratio
of lifeguards to the population is about 1:170; in Japan, the
ratio is 1:48,000.

"There are insufficient life-saving clubs in Japan," Kobayashi
said. "Only 40 clubs are registered with our association. And
although life-saving clubs at the local level and in universities
have been increasing in the last five years, it is a sad fact
that we have very few officially qualified life-savers in
beaches."

Simply learning how to swim is not enough. Children must learn
that swimming in pools is drastically different from swimming in
the sea.

Life-saving skills

Although 18 years is the minimum age required to learn actual
life-saving skills in Japan, Kobayashi attests that anybody of
any age can be taught how to read tides, currents and wave
movements--vital knowledge necessary for protection from the
seemingly unpredictable sea.

"In Australia, children as young as 6 years old have the
opportunity to learn about practical water safety," said
Kobayashi. "Under the guidance of life-savers, children are
actually made to feel the pull of tides and undercurrents. And
they are taught ways to brace against them."

But as yet, no system for ensuring water safety skills and
knowledge exist in Japan, he said, blaming the dearth of
certified life-saving trainers .

Private swimming lessons available to the public normally do
not offer such courses unless they belong to one of the 40
registered life-saving clubs. And despite the Education
Ministry's keenness to have children learn how to swim, teaching
techniques on personal survival are absent from school curriculum
guidelines.

The NPA makes a yearly effort to give school children lectures
on water safety and it increases its patrol around accident prone
areas. But, even so, since the beginning of July, 382 deaths have
already occurred (some 21 others are still unaccounted for).
Sixty of the victims were children.

"I personally wish that schools would someday include personal
survival skills as part of their swimming lessons," said
Kobayashi.

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Swimming is no
exception.

LIFE: How stressed are you?

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By TOSHIO JO
Asahi Evening News

Which would be more devastating, your wife's death or your
company's bankruptcy?

A ridiculous question? Not for Japanese men in their 40s and
50s, who are committing suicide in increasing numbers because of
rising work-related stress, experts say.

Middle-aged men actually suffer the same amount of stress when
faced with their company's failure as they do when a spouse dies,
according to a survey by a group of Osaka-based psychotherapists.

The survey recorded the results of a stress test designed and
conducted by Makoto Natsume, director at the Mental Health
Promotion Division at the Osaka Prefectural Mental Health Center,
and his colleagues.

The 1988 test asked some 480 men between the ages of 40 and 59
to rate the intensity of shock they would feel in the above
scenarios on a scale of zero to 100. Men in their 50s gave both
crises the same average score 78. Men in their 40s scored their
wives' deaths at 80 and failure by their companies at 78.

The survey's startling revelation of an all-consuming
corporate culture was clear when it was conducted during the peak
of the economic boom in 1988.

It has become tragically clearer in the last eight years.

Restructuring blues

As Japanese companies reel from the effects the deep economic
recession that began in 1991, middle-aged employees are facing
stress from overwork, bullying and the once-unthinkable
possibility of losing their jobs.

The result: More of them are killing themselves.

According to the National Police Agency, 3,626 men in their
50s committed suicide last year, up from 3,080 before the
recession in 1991. Among these, 898 killed themselves because of
"economic and livelihood related problems," leading all of the
age groups in the number of suicides committed for similar
reasons.

While many say the economy is on the rebound--many pointing to
rising corporate earnings--companies are continuing unprecedented
restructuring programs that are putting many long-time employees
out of work and generating more stress for those who watch their
job security erode around them.

In May, the nation's unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, its
highest since 1953 when the government first began providing
jobless data.

"The number of patients being treated for stress-related
problems here at the Osaka center has increased over the past few
years," said Natsume, a work stress specialist. "The number of
female patients has increased, too, as a logical consequence of
the increase in working women.

Suicidal tendencies

"I estimate that about 60 percent of these patients have
expressed a desire to die, and about 30 percent actually try to
commit suicide."

In terms of personality, people who are diligent at work and
feel strong work responsibility are most prone to work-related
depression, Natsume and other mental experts say.

Toru Sekiya, head of the Sekiya Neuro-Psychiatric Clinic in
Tokyo's Shibuya Ward, agrees.

"I cannot help predicting that the number of suicides by
people in these age groups (40 to 60) will further increase,"
said Sekiya.

In addition to the threat of job losses, corporate
restructuring has several other stressful effects, Sekiya said.
One is that as companies reduce their employees, the remaining
workers have to work hard to take up the slack.

Another effect is bullying.

"In some cases, computer workers or clerical workers are
reassigned to become salesmen, which is a typical case of
bullying," Sekiya said.

Sekiya described one patient who came to his clinic because of
the stress he felt after an unfair transfer.

"He could not kill himself. He could not go to work. And he
could not tell his wife about what happened, feeling that she
could never understand his situation. In the end, he had nowhere
else to go but the clinic," he said.

Natsume of the Osaka center shared a similar story about a
48-year-old man who tried to commit suicide after a successful
26-year career with a general trading house.

Natsume said the man, who had a wife and son, was transferred
to Europe to be vice president in charge of the company's
branches in there. He was forced to live alone. As sales faltered
and the company headquarters pressured him to improve them, the
man became stressed.

He started to have trouble sleeping at night and began feeling
lonely without having anyone to talk to. Six months after he was
transferred to Europe, he tried to commit suicide by taking
sleeping pills.

Natsume said the man was found by a neighbor in a coma, but
his life was saved.

The man and his wife turned to Natsume for professional help.
After six months of resting and counseling, he got over his
depression, and returned to work.

"He was lucky because his wife was very understanding and
never said anything negative even though he had to take months
off work," Natsume said, adding that good family relations and
hobbies for relaxation purposes are two key elements in leading a
healthy life and helping deeply stressed people who have become
depressed.

Work-related suicides or karoshi (death caused by overwork)
has drawn the attention of lawyers.

In March, a landmark ruling was handed down when the Tokyo
District Court ordered Dentsu Inc. to pay about 120 million yen
in damages to the parents of an employee who killed himself in
August 1991. The court attributed the suicide to depression
caused by overwork and lack of sleep.

Since the start of 1996, a Karoshi Hot Line Service, a legal
advice and counseling service provided by a nationwide group of
lawyers, has received many calls from the relatives of men who
have killed themselves because of work-related depression.

Feeling responsibility

One of them was a 40-something middle manager for a
manufacturing company. He committed suicide because of depression
brought on by his sense of heavy responsibility at work, his
relatives said. Before he died, he would come home around 11 p.m.
and leave home 4:30 a.m.

Another man in his 40s threw himself into the path of an
oncoming train. He had to work long hours on weekdays and work
even on weekends. Before he took his own life, he often
complained to his family members that he could not sleep at
night.

"Japanese salaried men in their 40s and 50s should learn more
from younger people, who do not see work as being everything in
life," said the Osaka center's Natsume.

"I believe that one of the darkest sides to the ongoing
restructuring within the Japanese business community is the fact
that many of the people who have been let go contributed to
better workplace human relations. Their departure has made the
Japanese workplace atmosphere and environment cold and less human
at the expense of productivity."

Sex shop slaying investigated

Tokyo police began questioning four employees of a chain of
sex-related businesses, arrested on suspicion of fraud, violation
of the Stimulants Control Law and the Swords and Firearms Law,
over the disappearance late last year of the owner of the
business and a manager, police said Friday.

Police said they suspected the owner and the manager, both 33,
were murdered for money and their bodies were dumped somewhere.
Last Thursday, investigators raided four clubs belonging to the
sex chain, police said.

The four were arrested in separate cases.

In January, the owner's father reported to police that his son
had been missing from his condominium in Shibuya Ward since
December last year, police said. Police say gangsters, as well,
may have had a role in the disappearance.

Foreign residents left out of disaster drills

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By MASAYOSHI SUGA and TARO KARASAKI
Asahi Evening News

While acknowledging that many foreign residents were left out
in the cold in the Jan. 17, 1995, Great Hanshin Earthquake, many
local governments say they have not included programs to help
non-Japanese residents during the annual disaster prevention
drills that will be held this week throughout the country.

Tokyo, home to more than 260,000 registered foreigners from
160 countries, and the location of hundreds of embassies and
consulates, conducts a disaster prevention drill today.

The drill by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government will be carried
out on the assumption that an earthquake of the same magnitude as
the Hanshin quake had hit Adachi Ward. One of the key
responsibilities of the metropolitan government during such a
crisis would be to communicate with foreign victims and relevant
organizations, such as foreign embassies and consulates.

However, while a disaster headquarters will be operated by
senior officials to rehearse command and communications
procedures, no member of the metropolitan government's
International Affairs Division will be included in the
headquarters team.

This is despite the fact that the office's main task in the
event of an earthquake would be to coordinate programs to help
foreigners and communicate with organizations, embassies and
consulates.

"No specific programs involving foreigners have been included
in this year's drill," said Tetsuo Imasu, head of the division.
"But we hope we will be able to incorporate some measures next
year."

The division last week announced a program to hire 200
language volunteers, both Japanese and non-Japanese, who can help
in the event of disasters. Their jobs will cover a wide range of
activities, including providing information for foreigners and
printing foreign-language materials, helping foreigners at
shelters and assisting foreign rescue teams.

The division plans to train the volunteers and hopefully
include them in next year's drill.

The Kobe Municipal Government says that it has not included
any special programs involving foreigners in its disaster
prevention drills scheduled for Tuesday.

"We are still trying to put together a manual for foreign
residents on what to do in a disaster. Any plan to hold a special
drill for foreign residents will have to come after that," said
Takashi Yokotani of the Kobe Citizen's Service Bureau.

Yokotani said the manual should be completed by the end of
this fiscal year and the bureau would possibly study plans on how
to incorporate foreigners in drills in fiscal 1997.

"We have invited representatives of various community groups
(to the drill), and if they have any contact with foreign
residents, I would assume that they would convey whatever knowhow
is needed," said Yokotani.

However, the head of a volunteer group in the Kansai region
questions whether the city-run disaster drills are the best way
to help foreigners prepare for disasters.

"I don't think that it is such a good idea to have the
government set up everything," said Taro Tamura, head of the
Center for Multicultural Information and Assistance.

"What local governments should do is to nurture and answer the
needs of non-profit groups that are close to the foreign
residents. In the end, that should help foreign residents in a
disaster situation," said Tamura.

Tamura's group will today provide advice on how to prepare for
disasters in a special radio program to be aired on the
Kobe-based FM station Cocolo.

The program will provide advice on where foreigners can go to
get relief supplies and how to apply for gift money.

The Kanagawa Prefectural Government also said it does not plan
any special programs for foreigners in its drill today, but will
hold a joint communication exercise with the U.S. military forces
in the prefecture.

The city government of Nagoya does not have any plans to
include foreign residents in its drill, but the city office for
international exchange will hold a lecture on Sept. 9 on how to
prepare for an earthquake.

"We are aware that it is important to involve foreign
residents. But as many foreign residents are located in scattered
communities, it is difficult to get them all together," said
Fumitaka Kito of the Nagoya International Center.

Conventions show chameleon side of U.S. politics

from ASAHI SHIMBUN/ASAHI EVENING NEWS, September 02, 1996

By YOICHI FUNABASHI
Asahi Shimbun

CHICAGO--Both Republicans and Democrats blurred their
traditional party lines at presidential conventions last month to
woo crucial floating voters for their candidates, Bob Dole and
Bill Clinton.

In past presidential elections, Republicans made it a rule to
underscore patriotism, while Democrats used to give top priority
to standard of living.

In an attempt to disguise their hawkish and dovish feathers,
however, Republicans and Democrats presented strikingly similar
stances in San Diego and Chicago on key policy issues such as the
role of government, family ties and crime.

It seems that Republicans and Democrats had better trade their
mascots, the elephant and the donkey, for the chameleon.

Republicans and Democrats have also shed their traditional
images as the stern father and the affectionate mother.

Republicans selected Susan Molinari, a representative from New
York, as the convention's keynote speaker to project a soft image
to win support from women--the lack of which is viewed as Dole's
Achilles' heel.

The party election machine tactically focused TV cameras on
her five-month-old daughter, held in the arms of Molinari's
father.

The Clinton administration, meanwhile, has taken a harder line
since Democrats suffered a devastating defeat in elections two
years ago largely because male white voters expressed discontent
with the party's generous welfare spending, lax crime control,
and liberal affirmative action programs.

Democrats have recently attacked big government, even scaling
down welfare programs which had long been the core of their
platform.

In point of fact, huge fiscal deficits afford little policy
leeway to either Republicans or Democrats other than to propose
small government.

While the two parties try to transform their images,
traditionalists are shaking both camps.

Jesse Jackson galvanized his Democrat audience by criticizing
"fundamentalist" Republican elements seeking to minimize welfare
support, restrict foreign imports, oust immigrants, and oppose
abortion.

But the Democratic Party, too, has been a patchwork of many
interest groups. The disappearance of the old threat from the
former Soviet bloc has made this more evident, as it cast loose
divergent voices within both party folds.

As rhetorical strategy, Republicans and Democrats have
similarly labeled themselves as progressives, shunning such
Right-Left stereotypes as conservatives and liberals.

Clinton is particularly adept at this, and he is often derided
as a "Republican Lite," like the beer, or in this sense a
pseudo-Republican.

That is why Molinari pleased Republican audiences when she
made fun of the president's opportunism. She said her speech
--like Clinton's campaign promises--will not last long and will
sound just like a Republican's.

At the same time, her words revealed the frustrations within
the Grand Old Party, whose traditional policy strengths have been
successfully mimicked by the Democratic Party.

In his showdown with the

73-year-old Dole, Clinton, 50, portrays himself as the man who
represents the interests of 77 million U.S. baby boomers.

In his nomination acceptance speech, Dole said he wants to
serve as a bridge to regain the U.S. values in the good old days
--the values he himself represents.

The patriotism voiced by someone like Dole, whose right hand
is handicapped from World War II injuries, exerts tremendous
pressure on Democrats, particularly on Clinton, who has been
accused of shirking military service during the Vietnam War.

To fight back, Democrats mobilized young children--among them
Clinton's daughter Chelsea--at the convention, to symbolize their
contrary argument that the next president must serve as a bridge
to the future, not to the past.

When he celebrated the 50th anniversary of his birthday
shortly before the convention, Clinton said yesterdays will
outnumber tomorrows from now on.

His reference to yesterdays seems to suggest the huge
political clout that the U.S. baby boomer generations have
acquired to protect their interests.

Clinton intentionally did not invite Jimmy Carter to the
convention. Carter ignominiously lost reelection in 1980, and
Clinton did not want his own nomination tarnished by association
with the former Democratic president. The snub may also reflect
Clinton's own ego, his belief that he belongs to a generation
completely different to Carter's.

At the conventions, Dole and Clinton were evenly matched.

If outward show is all that matters in politics, the
Republican Party might have taken a slight lead.

In their speeches, Dole dwelt on his past and Clinton listed
policy challenges. Dole may have better impressed voters with
sincerity, whereas Clinton may have displayed greater political
dexterity.

But the booming economy and comfortable leads in opinion polls
are firmly supporting the Democrat incumbent. Clinton is content
to draw on his track record in office, and evades direct
engagement with Dole that might narrow the gap and lend more
credibility to the challenger.

It is often a mistake, however, to judge the entire trend of
U.S. politics from the speakers and delegates at presidential
conventions.

The consciousness of floating, middle-of-the-road voters
--once described as the country's silent majority--is quite
different from those people who have recently occupied the TV
screens.
