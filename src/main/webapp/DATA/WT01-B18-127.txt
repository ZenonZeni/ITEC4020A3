<H4>The Energy Foundation will support regional transportation reform through analysis, policy research, regulatory work, and advocacy. The foundation will explore policy options that promote alternatives to increased single-occupancy vehicle use and to new highway construction. The foundation will also support analysis and advocacy to promote increased vehicle fuel efficiency.</H4>

Transportation accounts for a third of all energy use in the United States and is responsible for nearly 30 percent of total U.S. carbon emissions. Cars and trucks alone consume 63 percent of all petroleum in the country. To make matters worse, the number of vehicle miles traveled in the U.S. is climbing at twice the rate of population growth.
<P>
Yet the transportation sector has tremendous potential for efficiency gains. The average fuel efficiency of new cars sold in the U.S. doubled between 1973 and 1987, largely due to federal standards. New automobile models have been developed that are more than three times as fuel-efficient as today's average. Advanced vehicle propulsion technologies are progressing, spurred especially by innovative policy in California. 
<P>
New transportation planning approaches also show promise. Public transit, improved bicycle facilities, high-occupancy vehicle lanes, pedestrian-oriented design, and an expanding array of transportation-control measures provide mobility while reducing environmental damage. 
<P>
The 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) gives states unprecedented flexibility in how they allocate more than $150 billion in federal transportation dollars. Coupled with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which require state transportation plans to show compliance with federal air quality standards, ISTEA now allows metropolitan regions to harness substantial funding for alternatives to new highway construction.
