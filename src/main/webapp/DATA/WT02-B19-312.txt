<BR>
As negotiations continue between the White House and Congress on the seven year balance budget plan contained in the reconciliation bill and on the six remaining appropriations bills, it is important that we keep up our communication with Members and the Administration on the need for education funding.  There is increasing pressure on Congress and the Administration to reach a budget deal by Christmas.  This means that this week is crucial for advocates of education funding to be heard. It is particularly important that Senator Dole (R-KS), Senator Domenici (R-NM), Representative Kasich (R-OH) and Representative Gingrich (R-GA) are contacted.            <B><U><BR>
</B></U>Before you leave for Christmas vacation, call your Representative or Senator at (202) 225-3121.  You can reach the White House by calling (202) 456-1111.  Tell them:<P>
*     I oppose Congress's proposed cuts in education programs.  Education funding is important!  The IDEA and Javits gifted program support services needed for the education of exceptional children.<BR>
<BR>
*     In my school district, children with disabilities (or gifts) have been helped through (your own success story about a child with exceptionalities). <BR>
<BR>
*     Please tell the Congressional leadership you want investment in education, not cuts in education funding.<B><U><BR>

<CENTER></U>LEGISLATIVE UPDATE<U><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
          </U>                   December 21, 1995<U><P>
FY 1996 Appropriations (the saga continues....)<P>
</B></U>As of December 18, the budget impasse between the President and Congress continues.  The second continuing resolution that funded the government through December 15 has ended and Federal departments that do not have an signed appropriation bill for FY 1996 are closed.  The closed departments include the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.  Thus, FY 1996 appropriation levels for IDEA programs and the Javits gifted program have not yet been designated.  <P>
The philosophical differences between President Clinton and the Congress, particularly the House  Republicans, continue to block progress on the reconciliation bill and the remaining appropriation legislation.  The six appropriation bills that have not been enacted contain controversial measures that have blocked their passage.  The Congressional leadership has so far refused to grant another continuing resolution to extend appropriations for programs not yet funded, without a Presidential agreement on their plan to balance the Federal budget in seven years, contained in the reconciliation bill.  With the reconciliation bill calling for drastic cuts over seven years in Medicare ($270 billion), Medicaid ($163 billion) and discretionary programs such as education ($440 billion), the President has refused to agree to the bill and the proposed cuts (please see following piece on the reconciliation bill for more information).  Clinton has responded with his own proposal for reaching a balanced budget in seven years that would cut Medicare by $124 billion, Medicaid by $54 billion and discretionary spending by $250 billion.  So far, no agreement between the two sides has been reached and thus, we are in the middle of another shutdown of those Federal agencies and programs that do not have an appropriation bill enacted. <B><U><P>
</B></U>As the attached alert indicates, this week is a crucial week for the education community.  The President and Congress are negotiating what will be the final outcome for the reconciliation package and the remaining appropriations bills.  Our education funding for FY 1996 and in future years could be decided this week as pressure mounts to have a budget agreement by Christmas.  Please stay in contact with your Congressional members on the importance of education funding.<B><U><BR>

Reauthorization of IDEA<P>
</B></U>On November 20th, the Senate released its draft bill that would reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  The draft includes several changes to IDEA.  Following is an overview of some of those changes, as well as CEC's responses to the proposals.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><B><U>KEY FEATURES OF SENATE DRAFT</B></U><BR>

<B><U>CEC's RESPONSE</B></U><BR>

</CENTER><B>Definitions<BR>
</B><BR>
The Senate draft does not add new disability categories to the 13 categories already listed under IDEA.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports the Senate's decision, but urges the Subcommittee to adopt the Administration's proposal to change the term "serious emotional disturbance" to "emotional disturbance."<P>
CEC recommends the Senate allow states the option of using the term "developmental delay" for ages 3 through 8, to allow children with disabilities to be served in the primary grades without the need for the designation of a diagnostic category.  Currently, children ages 3 to 5 may be served under this term.<BR>

<B>Grants to States</B><P>
The draft proposes to: simplify eligibility requirements; increase local flexibility in the use of funds and program innovation; continue the current funding formula based on the number of students receiving special education services; and maintains the 40% average per-pupil expenditure authorization level.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports retaining the current formula for state grants.  A formula change could cause large shifts in the amount of funds states receive to assist in providing services to children with disabilities.  Also, a formula change may penalize states that have worked diligently to identify and serve all students with disabilities.<P>
CEC also supports retaining language specifying the federal commitment to children with disabilities.  Even though the federal government has never met its commitment to provide states 40% of the average per pupil expenditure for every child with a disability, it is extremely important to work towards this goal.<BR>

<B>Incidental Benefit</B><P>
The draft allows local funds to be provided to a child with a disability in a regular class, even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from those services.  The draft also allows incidental benefit to children covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.<BR>

<P>
CEC strongly supports this language, as these common sense provisions will go a long way in allowing teachers and related services personnel to provide services to IDEA eligible children without regard to the incidental benefit to other children.<BR>







<B>Re-Evaluation</B><P>
The draft stipulates that re-evaluations occur every three years OR at key transition junctures in the educational process, such as the transition from elementary school to middle or junior high school.<BR>

<P>
CEC strongly supports this stipulation, and believes that it, coupled with provisions related to situations in which additional data is not needed, will promote more useful and appropriate evaluations.<BR>

<B>Notification of School of Intention to File a Complaint</B><P>
The draft requires parents to notify the school of their intention to file a complaint at least 10 days prior to the date of filing if parents have new information or if the local education agency is unaware of the nature of the complaint.<BR>

<P>
<BR>
CEC believes this provision will assist schools and parents to work together to solve problems before the need for litigation.<BR>

<B>Mediation</B><P>
The draft requires state education agencies to provide mediation as an option to parents.<BR>

<P>
While CEC affirms the need for parents to have the support they need for mediation and a role in structuring the mediation, we are concerned that the process does not result in an adversarial situation as sometimes results in the current due process procedures.<BR>

<B>Preschool Program</B><P>
The draft retains the current formula for this program.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports the retention of the formula.  We are concerned that the coordination language does not have the 1 percent cap that is included for state-level coordination activities under the larger Part B program, and urge the Subcommittee to institute a similar cap.<BR>

<B>Support Programs</B><P>
The draft's Part D, Research and Personnel Preparation, provides a program section and budget authorization for research and innovation activities under the areas of: New Knowledge Production; Integration of Research and Practice; and Improving the Use of Professional Knowledge.  The draft also provides a program section and budget authorization for personnel preparation activities under the areas of: High Incidence Disabilities; Leadership Preparation; Low Incidence Disabilities; and Projects of National Significance.<P>
The support programs would continue to be administered at the federal level.<P>
The draft directs that the Secretary <U>may</U> direct funds into critical areas.<BR>

<P>
CEC acknowledges that the Senate provides a sound basic framework for the vital support of IDEA programs.  While the number of appropriation line-items would be reduced, proven components of the existing support programs would be retained with the overall proposed funding level constant in relation to the currently level of fiscal support.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
CEC has long proposed this continuation. <P>
<BR>
This approach should be changed to <U>shall</U>.  CEC understands that instances occur where <U>may</U> is the appropriate approach, but we must guard against giving near total flexibility to the department respecting annual allocations.  Many of the functions <BR>


covered through the support authorities are critical services, and the disruption caused by on-again, off-again funding would be significant.<BR>

<B>Indexing of the Support Programs</B><P>
The draft establishes precedents that affirm the principle of indexing support activities within both Part B and Part H.  Specifically, portions of the Part B draft with respect to studies and evaluations and portions of the Part H draft with respect to the FICC include indexed functions.<BR>

<P>
CEC believes all of the IDEA support programs should be indexed within Parts B and H of the Act. While a controversial proposal, we have witnessed this year how severely these programs can be threatened in actual appropriations, precipitating a forceful national reaffirmation of the vital importance of these support programs.<BR>

<B>Early Intervention</B><P>
The draft includes an amendment on the uses of funds, which states that "...in any State that does not provide services for at-risk infants and toddlers...to strengthen the statewide system by initiating, expanding, or improving collaborative efforts related to at-risk infants and toddlers..."<BR>

<P>
CEC questions the need for such an amendment.  It is our understanding that the use of Part H funds for child identification, evaluation, and referral is already an allowable use of funds and that, in fact, many States so use their funds for this purpose.  The proposed language may actually limit the intended uses of funds, since it refers only to States not serving at-risk children.  A number of States serving at-risk children have narrowly defined the eligible population.  The proposed language might be interpreted as prohibiting them from using funds to evaluate and refer other at-risk children.  If confusion exists, it should be clarified in report language.  <BR>

<B>Policy/Regulations</B><P>
The draft prohibits the Secretary of Education from establishing a new rule without following the public comment and review requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act.  The draft also requires the Secretary to publish in the <I>Federal Register</I> a list of correspondence from the Department of Education and include a description of the interpretation of the Department.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports both of these proposals.<BR>

<B>Personnel Standards</B><P>
The draft retains the current statute respecting personnel standards.<BR>

<P>
CEC urges the inclusion of three important modifications with respect to the "highest requirement" provisions: the statute must specifically assign responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards to the state education agency.  Further, we believe that the foundational role of the professions in setting standards is vital and would use the term "professional standards" throughout this section.  Finally, we recommend inclusion of the following language in the statute:  "Establishment and Use of Levels of Personnel Within Disciplines.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, nothing prohibits the establishment and use by the <BR>


State education agency of different levels of personnel, including paraprofessionals, within specific occupations or disciplines if the State also specifies appropriate roles and responsibilities, training, and direct and indirect supervision for each level."<BR>

<B>CSPD</B><P>
The draft retains the requirement that each state maintain a comprehensive system of personnel development. <BR>

<P>
CEC remains concerned that any personnel development plan be developed and promoted through a process that promotes linkages in each State among all involved State agencies, institutions, and organizations that are concerned with a continuing supply of qualified personnel to serve children with disabilities.  <BR>

The draft also includes the concept of in-state partnerships as a major feature of the new proposed Part C.<BR>

CEC favors the inclusion of this feature, and look forward to discussing how that concept may be specifically applied to the CSPD and will continue to encourage a Professional Development Coordinating council (PDCC) charged with the specific task of developing and implementing the in-state CSPD.<BR>


<BR>
In its draft, the Senate also addressed the issues surrounding disciplining students with disabilities.  The draft addresses not only children who bring a dangerous weapon to school, it also comments on students who use, possess or distribute drugs; or engages in a behavior that may cause serious injury.  The draft also takes a step further and addresses students who engage in serious disruptive behavior. <P>
Both the House and the Senate are expected to introduce bills early next year.  The Senate is predicting floor action by the end of March.  House staff is still planning to link the IDEA reauthorization with the unpopular Education Reform Consolidation Grant in the introduced legislation.  For  further understanding of the differences between the Administration's bill, the House and Senate draft bills, and CEC's positions, please see the updated comparison of major provisions (<B>Attachment 1</B>).  Also see <B>Attachment 2</B>, for a summary of Parts C, D, and E of the Senate's draft.<BR>

<B><U>Reconciliation Bill</B></U><P>
On December 6, President Clinton vetoed the Republican's reconciliation bill that would balance the Federal budget by the year 2002.  The package included proposed cuts in several programs including: Medicare, Medicaid, the SSI program and other social welfare programs.  The final legislation included the following proposed changes:<P>
<B>Medicaid.</B>  Many in Washington think that the disagreements between the President and the Congressional majority on Medicaid may be the most difficult points for negotiation.  Currently, there are 3 proposals.  The Republican-backed proposal (passed by the Senate/House Conference Committee) eliminates entitlements and would allow states to determine who is eligible for services and what services to offer. (Wording that suggests that entitlements would continue for children 12 and under, pregnant women, and the disabled is so weak that many consider it irrelevant.)   Federal funds would be distributed to states in the form of block grants.  This plan would save $163 billion over 7 years.  A proposal by moderate Democrats (so-called "Blue Dogs") would retain entitlements (would not utilize block grants) and would save about $65 billion over 7 years.  Neither the Republican plan nor the "Blue Dog" plan include Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment Services (EPSDT) that are widely used to reimburse costs for school and community health services for children.  The President's proposal retains entitlements (no block grants), includes EPSDT, and would save $54 billion over 7 years.  For a side-by-side comparison of the Administration's plan and the Senate/House conference plan (Republican plan), see the attached paper prepared by the National Academy on Aging (<B>Attachment 3</B>).  Also attached is a chart showing estimated state-by-state Medicaid cuts under the Republican plan (<B>Attachment 4</B>).  It must be realized that <B>all</B> of these plans will mean significant cuts.   <BR>
<BR>
<B>SSI</B>.  The legislation would have changed the eligibility requirements for low-income children with disabilities to receive services under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. In order for a child to be considered disabled under the bill, the child must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations, and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than a year.  The bill would eliminate the use of the individualized functional assessment (IFA) in determining eligibility.  The legislation would also eliminate references to maladaptive behavior among medical criteria for evaluation of eligibility.  <BR>
Once a child meets the definition of disability, there is other criteria to meet before drawing benefits.  For a child under age 6, the child must have a medical impairment that severely limits the ability to function in a manner appropriate to his age and who, without special personal assistance, would require specialized care outside the home.   For a child who is aged 6 and above, the child must require personal care assistance with at least two activities of daily living, continual 24-hour supervision or monitoring to avoid causing injury or harm to self or others, or the administration of medical treatment.  If the child did not receive such assistance the child would require full-time or part-time specialized care outside the home.  Children who meet this criteria will receive 100 percent of the benefit amount.  Children who do not meet this criteria will receive 75 percent of the benefit.<BR>
<BR>
The reconciliation bill would also require the Government Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct a study on the extra expenses incurred by families with a child receiving SSI benefits.  <BR>
<BR>
     <B>Child Nutrition Programs. </B> The legislation would cut proposed funding for child<BR>
     nutrition programs by $6 billion over 7 years. <P>
Additional changes in child nutrition programs are contained in the Welfare Reform bill that Congress has passed but not yet sent to the President for his signature.  Senator Lugar (R-IN) has refused to sign the conference report because of his opposition to the changes called for in the child nutrition programs.  The propose changes would allow 22 States in FY 1996 and in succeeding years, all States, to have the option of receiving funds to carry out programs offering school breakfasts and lunches for all school children under a block grant.  Under the block grant, States will be allowed to provide their own minimum nutritional requirements for meals and  set their own income eligibility limitations but must provide access to free meals to students from families that are below 130 percent of the poverty level.<BR>
<BR>
Because President Clinton vetoed this legislation and Congress has not attempted to override the veto, these proposed cuts will not take place unless they are included in new legislation that gains Presidential approval.  It is important, however, to understand the proposed changes as Congress attempts to work out a compromise with the Administration.<BR>

<B><U>Report on Education Spending</B></U><BR>
   <BR>
The Economic Policy Institute has recently released a report titled <I>Where's the Money Gone? Changes in the Level and Composition of Education Spending.</I>  The report seeks to refute the assertion that per pupil expenditure for elementary and secondary education spending has doubled in the last quarter century and that there has been no noticeable improvement in student performance.  The document reports the findings of researchers who examined nine "typical" school districts.<P>
The study makes the case that the increases in education spending are not for  regular education expenditures and that other costs such as serving special populations are receiving most of the increases in spending.  The findings of the study show that for the assessed school districts, that the share of expenditures going to regular education decreased from 80 percent to 59 percent between 1967 and 1991.  In the same period, expenditures for special education increased from 4 percent to 17 percent.  Of new funding for education spent in 1991, the report states 26 percent went to regular education and 38 percent went to special education.  Finally, per pupil expenditures for regular education grew an average of 1 percent a year during this quarter century for a total of only 28 percent.    <P>
The study acknowledges that severely disabled students would not have been in schools at all in 1967 and would have been cared for at home or in other institutions.  The study further points out that advances in medical science have allowed children who would have died before reaching school age, to survive and attend school. The release of the report is sure to resonate in the education community.   CEC strongly believes that funding currently spent to provide children with disabilities a free, appropriate public education, results in more independent, taxpaying citizens that will substantially contribute to the welfare of society.  While the report does not suggest a realignment of funding priorities, CEC is concerned that some will see an either/or proposition between regular education and special education.  We reject that proposition; funding should be available to improve the education of all children.  CEC will continue to work to make education funding a national priority.                                                                                              <P>
<BR>

<CENTER><B>FEDERAL UPDATE<U><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
How Federal Agencies Operate Under Continuing Resolutions</B></U><P>
Last week (December 11-15), the President requested that Congress pass another continuing resolution (CR) that would keep the government open until January 23rd.  By then, the President hoped that he and Congress would have passed all the parts of the 1996 budget.  As of December 18, no CR has been passed, so all federal agencies and departments without passed budgets are again closed except for essential employees.  These agencies and departments include Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State and Veterans affairs, Environmental Protection, and NASA.  One of the possibilities that has been discussed if no agreement is reached is for Congress and the President to pass a long-term continuing resolution until the end of 1996, allowing the voters to settle the difference in November (by voting for the party whose budget priorities they support).  Because of this possibility and the multiple continuing resolutions already utilized this fall, you may want to know more about this process.  Below is an in-depth look at how one department (education) handles paying its bills under a CR. <P>
While agencies work under a CR, they only have access to funds allocated for that period.  In the meantime, their expenses continue and bills must be paid.  Bills come in from utilities and merchants; from staff salaries; and from grants, contracts, and research funded through the agencies and departments.  Do all the bills get paid?  If not, how are priorities set?<P>
According to a U.S. Department of Education employee with expertise in these matters, payments are rarely stopped, but at times money can be delayed or temporarily reduced on a case-by-case basis.  Following are some of the steps and decisions as they are made in the Department of Education:<P>
&iuml;     Each Department receives an allocation of a certain amount of funds under a CR.  If a  CR encompasses 9% of the fiscal year, each department under the CR is allocated 9% of the funds that were authorized for the year. (The actual dollar amounts may be below authorized levels if the CR specifies the allocation of only a proportion of authorized funds.)<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     As bills are received, the Department pays as many as it can afford with the money that has been allocated under the CR.  Complete and timely payments are made as long as the total bills submitted for payment are no more than the amount allocated under the CR (9% of fiscal year budget in this case).   <BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Department employees look ahead to see if any major expenditures fall into the CR period that would result in more funds being billed than are available under the CR.  If this is the case, some payments may be delayed or payments may not be made in full until further funds are allocated.  (We have been assured that most of the time under CRs all bills are paid in full and on time.)  <BR>
 <BR>
&iuml;     In order to cut expenses at the Department to ensure that all expenses can be paid, sometimes the funding for new projects or initiatives is delayed so that continuing work can be completed.<BR>

<B><U>Federal Support for Education</B></U><P>
According to the U.S. Department of Education, President Clinton based his 7-year budget on maintaining funding for education.  He calls all Department of Education expenditures in his bill investments in America's future.  In spite of pressure from the majority party in Congress and from other federal departments and agencies whose budgets are also in doubt, President Clinton has stood firmly behind maintenance of funding for the major education programs.  Sources say that the President insists on funding all education programs at the levels he specified in his original budget.  Major ED programs are outlined below:<BR>

Attached are Department of Education fact sheets comparing federal support for education in each state under the President's proposal and under the House proposal (see <B>Attachment 5</B>). The Senate's proposal is about $3.5 billion dollars lower than the President's budget and $1.5 billion higher than the House's proposal. <BR>

<B><U>OSEP Extends Deadline for Research Grant Applications</B></U><P>
The deadline for the Field-Initiated Research Projects Competition has been extended from November 17, 1995 to March 29, 1996. The reason for this change is to allow competitors to consider any changes in funding or priorities that might be made by Congress.  There are currently proposals in Congress to severely diminish funding for these projects or eliminate them entirely.<P>

</CENTER><BR>
<B><U>Higher Rates of Inclusion for Students with Disabilities in NAEP</B></U><P>
The U.S. Department of Education has been working for some time with the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) to increase the number of students with disabilities included in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). This will address a long-standing problem of limited data for assessing the scholastic achievement and progress of children with disabilities. Currently, only 40% of children with disabilities are included in the NAEP.  Officials expect that proportion to increase to at least 70% in the next year.   The goal of the Department is to assess at least 98% of children with disabilities using the NAEP.     <BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Gun-Free Schools Act Update</B></U><P>
According to the U.S. Department of Education, in the year since the Gun-Free Schools Act was passed into law, 47 states and the District of Columbia have passed their own laws or enacted policies of zero tolerance for guns.  These policies and laws mandate expulsion of at least one year for students who bring guns to school.  CEC supports efforts to make schools safe for children and staff.   <P>
CEC has been active in discussions involving discipline, but does NOT support expulsion as a general practice.  Years ago, people felt that many students with disabilities were not educable, had no place in schools, and had no right to an education.  We feel that expulsion for at least a year is tantamount to giving up on students by denying them an education.  CEC does not support mandatory expulsion for ANY children, regardless of whether or not they have disabilities.   <P>
At November's National Association of State Directors of Special Education (NASDSE) Conference, Thomas Hehir, Director of the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), voiced similar concerns.  He has been credited with saying, "We don't support excluding kids from education."  <P>
<B><U>Does your school meet ADA standards?</B></U><P>
The U.S. Department of Education has published a guide that schools can use to determine their compliance with ADA.   It is entitled <I>Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act: A self- evaluation guide for public elementary and secondary schools.</I> Each school district can receive one free copy.  Additional copies are $21.00.  It can be ordered by calling the U.S. Government Printing Office at (202) 512-1800.<P>

<B><U>Results of Pilot PASS Test</B></U><P>
The Performance Assessment for Self-Sufficiency (PASS) system was developed to provide a way to collect, synthesize, and report service needs of students after they have exited the educational system.  Results of a field test on the PASS system, conducted in 1991-1992, are reported in OSEP's <I>17th Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of IDEA</I>.  Based upon data collected from 10 states, it was found that 80% of the students with disabilities in this sample required case management services.  Of the 16 services studied, this was the most common need.  The field test also concluded that only 3% of students with disabilities did not need primary additional services.  This raises two important questions:<P>
&iuml;     Are federal, state, and local governments prepared and equipped to provide these services?<BR>
&iuml;     Can schools be said to be providing FAPE if 97% of these students have primary needs that must be addressed in order for them to function?   <BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Department Issues Its Semiannual Regulatory Agenda</B> </U><P>
Twice a year, the U.S. Department of Education publishes its regulatory agenda.  The items included in the agenda are either (a) in the proposed rulemaking stage, (b) in the final rule stage, or (c) recently completed actions. The agenda gives us an overview of the Department's current activities.  Following is a sample of regulations currently in the rulemaking process that, once implemented, will effect certain professionals and parents of children with exceptionalities.  If you would like further information about any of these, please contact Jay McIntire at (703) 264-9418.  We'll make sure you are kept up to date on any issue of specific concern to you. <P>

<B><U>World AIDS Day, 1995</B></U><P>
President Clinton has proclaimed November 30 as World AIDS Day.  In a statement, the President noted that more than 500,000 Americans have been struck by AIDS and that more than 300,000 of these have since died.  It is estimated that each year, 10,000 to 12,000 teenagers contract HIV.  The President pointed out that more than 90% of all children with AIDS receive assistance from Medicaid and called for continued funding of the Medicaid program.  The President mentioned recent encouraging research progress and reaffirmed his commitments to battling AIDS and to offering compassion to adults and children afflicted with HIV or AIDS.<P>

<B><U>NCTM Comments</B></U><P>
Although many groups have completed curriculum standards, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' (NCTM) standards seem to be the most widely used and to have had the greatest effect on curriculum in schools.  NCTM's three volumes include <I>Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics</I>, <I>Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics</I>, and <I>Assessment Standards for School Mathematics</I>.  NCTM wants to hear your opinion on the standards and how they work (or don't work) in your schools and with your students.  They are seeking responses to three questions.  <P>
     <B>1</B>.   Do you think the Standards documents would benefit from specific clarifications,<BR>
     expansions or additions, or deletions?  (Please elaborate and be as specific as<BR>
     possible.)<P>
     <B>2</B>.   What strategies do you suggest for bringing about these changes in the Standards?      <BR>
        <B>3</B>.   What steps should NCTM take to make the ideas in the Standards more widely       used and implemented?<P>
NCTM seeks replies by January 15, 1996.  Send your comments to<I> Futures, NCTM, 1906 Association Drive, Reston, VA 22091-1593</I>.  (E-mail responses to <I>future@nctm.org</I>)  If you send comments to our friends in math education, please also send a copy to CEC's Department of Public Policy.  We want to know how NCTM's standards are working for exceptional children.  <P>
<B><U>Preventing Disabling Conditions: The Center for Disease Control & Prevention Perspective</B></U><P>
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention [of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)] has published the proceedings of its 1994 national conference on preventing disabling conditions.  The conference, which was held in September in Washington D.C., focused on the role of the private sector.  <I>Healthy People 2000</I> is HHS's plan for improving public health by the turn of the century.  This plan was started in 1987 by the U.S. Public Health Service and is made up of 300 specific objectives.  Nine of these are directly related to improving health status, reducing risk, or improving service delivery for children and youth with disabilities.  They are:<P>
&iuml;     increase the proportion of people with disabilities who engage in regular leisure time physical activity <BR>
&iuml;     decrease the proportion of people with disabilities who are overweight<BR>
&iuml;     increase the proportion of people with major depressive disorders who obtain treatment<BR>
&iuml;     provide access to quality preschool programs for all disadvantaged children & children with disabilities<BR>
&iuml;     reduce the incidence of secondary disabilities associated with head & spinal cord injuries<BR>
&iuml;     reduce trauma deaths and long-term disability (expand EMS systems and improve trauma systems)<BR>
&iuml;     increase the proportion of newborns screened for genetic disorders and the proportion receiving treatment for such disorders<BR>
&iuml;     increase to all states a service system for children with, or at risk of, chronic and disabling conditions<BR>
&iuml;     increase the proportion of people with disabilities who receive recommended clinical prevention services (screening, immunizations,...) <BR>
<BR>
The progress toward meeting these goals is widely varied, but the National Center for Health Statistics reports that 6% of the 300 objectives have been achieved.  It is likely that changes in Federal priorities will increase the variability across states.  Fortunately, 38 states and D.C. have published their own year 2000 objectives.  You may want to check and see if your state has established its goals.  If it has, find out to what extent the objectives consider the needs of children with disabilities and whether or not the state's efforts are succeeding.  If you find that the state is not meeting its health goals for these children, it may give you more leverage if the states take greater control over public health care via block grants.  If your state does not have any goals, it's time to start writing some.   (The information reported here is adapted from a chapter in CDC's proceedings based on a presentation by Drs. McGinnis & Rothstein of DHHS.) <P>
<B><U>Javits Grants for FY96</B></U><P>
As you may remember, funds for the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students' Education Program were cut by 48% in last summer's rescissions.  As a result of this setback, hard decisions had to be made by the U.S. Department of Education with respect to funding of projects.  The Department decided to continue funding the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented.  Its organization has changed somewhat, but further work will come out under most of the same names and institutions that have produced the fine work of the last five years.  In terms of demonstration grants, top priority went to providing continuation monies for grants already underway.  (CEC's Javits grant will be completed early in 1996.)  <P>
After planning for these expenditures, there was only enough money remaining to fund one new project from the 1995 competition. Congratulations go to The College of William and Mary.  Their project, to be led by Dr. Joyce VanTassel-Baska, was judged to be the best of the crop.  In her new grant, Dr. VanTassel-Baska and her team will continue to develop curriculum.  This time, their focus will be on problem-based, multidisciplinary curricula. <P>
The good news for the field of gifted education is that, as of December 14, the President's 7-Year Balanced Budget plan includes $9,521,000 for Javits in 1996.  His plan calls for increases every year through 2002 based upon inflation.  <P>
<B><U>IDEA-Part B and Preschool grants for FY97</B></U><P>
Due to likely changes in IDEA during reauthorization, the Department of Education has decided to change the procedure for FY97 grants for certain states.  States with plans from FY94-96 will be given the option to continue operating under those plans for 1997, rather than submit new plans.  All states will need to submit the regular<I> ED Form 80-0013</I> and complete an <I>Annual Data Report</I>.  For states with fully approved Part B plans, public participation requirements for any significant changes must be met and then <B>only</B> the changes need to be submitted to the Department for approval by March 1, 1996.  States with conditional approval need to provide information demonstrating that conditions warrent full approval before the FY97 extension option can be applied. This information must be submited by May 1, 1996. For more information, see September 6th's <I>Federal Register</I> or contact Ruth Ryder at OSEP at (202) 205-9018.<BR>

<CENTER><B>MISCELLANEOUS CAN INFORMATION      </B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B>CAN Workshop, Summer of 1996</B> -- Well, the dates have been chosen for our next summer CAN Workshop!!!  Mark your calendars now for July 14-16, 1996; the summer Workshop will be held at the ANA Westin Hotel, 2401 M Street, NW, in Washington, D.C. (it's near Georgetown!).  We're looking forward to a very busy year in D.C.!!!<P>
<B>CAN Has Proven It Does Make a Difference!!!</B> -- If you will all think back to the beginning of this year, we informed you of the need to educate the many new members of Congress who were not familiar with the variety of issues surrounding the education of students with exceptionalities.  Among the many pieces of information DPP created in order to assist you in your endeavors, we updated our annual "Budget Book." The book, which provides information on each of the programs under IDEA, was updated to include personal success stories of students who have greatly benefited because of IDEA.  We asked you to meet with your congressmen to not only give them a copy of the book, but let them know of any state-specific information you wanted to impart.  <P>
You may ask yourselves if your visits and CEC information did any good.  Well, stop asking yourselves!!!  There have been several special education "successes" that affirm the difference that you all have made. Following are just a few:<P>
&iuml;     Unfunded Mandate Legislation -- Part of the Contract with America, the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act, dealt with unfunded mandates.  Although there was an exception in the Act for any legislation that protected against discrimination, CEC was concerned that organizations such as the Heritage Foundation might succeed in getting IDEA included as an unfunded mandate.  Ultimately, the Heritage Foundation scaled back its criticisms of IDEA, and the final law excluded such legislation as IDEA and the ADA from its coverage.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution -- Another piece of the Contract with America would have amended the U.S. Constitution to require the Federal government to balance the budget by 2002.  While CEC supports the objective of a balanced budget amendment, we believe that we cannot afford to cut or eliminate programs that will significantly better the future of our children. The Amendment was defeated, thanks to the multitude of calls received from the field.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     FY 1995 Rescissions Bill -- The rescission package that was passed by both the House and Senate this past year would have cut $874.5 million from education programs for FY 1995 (the House had originally proposed cutting $1.7 billion!).  With the help of input from the field about these harmful cuts, President Clinton vetoed the bill. Another rescission package was ultimately passed, but cuts to education programs were considerably smaller than originally proposed.<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Child Nutrition Block Grants -- The Congress proposed to consolidate federal food and nutrition programs into block grants during the past year.  Because of input from the education field about the effect block grants could have on the number of low-income children who would qualify for school breakfast and lunch under the revised programs, Congress may drop this proposal altogether!<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     Proposals to eliminate or consolidate the U.S. Department of Education -- There have been several congressional proposals introduced that would either consolidate the Education Department with another cabinet-level department, or eliminate it altogether.  Because of the efforts from the education grassroots community, many congressmen still believe in the importance of a national presence in education.  <BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     The IDEA has generally had bipartisan support in both houses.  Indeed, despite our concerns, there is proof that many congressmen (freshmen and veterans alike) support federal education programs -- including the IDEA.  Nothing spells this out better than an article in "Exceptional Parent" written by Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-CA) -- a third-term Congressman, and thus a relatively new member of the House!  In the article, entitled <I>"Special Ed Deserves Special Emphasis</I>," the Chair of the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families notes that "IDEA helps fulfill our nation's moral commitment to educating America's children with disabilities.  Education transforms individuals who were once thought to be helpless, into productive, working, taxpaying citizens."  Cunningham adds that while the cost of educating these students is considerable, "this expenditure makes excellent fiscal sense.  Our investment of time and resources into education for thse students spare the financial cost of lifetime institutionalization, which might cost from $15,000 to 80,000 a year for each child.  It also preserves the important contributions people with disabilities make to society."  We couldn't have said it better ourselves!!<BR>
<BR>
&iuml;     FY 1996 Appropriations -- As you know, the House passed an appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, HHS, and Education that would cut $162 million from special purposes programs funded under IDEA, eliminating funding for 7 of the 14 support programs.  The House also appropriated only $3 million for the Javits gifted and talented program for FY 1996.  Thanks to all of your calls and letters to your Senators, the Senate appropriated $153 million more for special education than under the House bill.  Also, although the Senate bill would still cut special education $7.4 million from the FY 1995 funding level, no support programs were eliminated!!<BR>
<BR>
So, as you can see from the above examples, your phone calls, letters, and personal visits to your congressperson really do have a positive impact on legislation that effects students with exceptionalities.  Keep up your support...we still have a long way to go until IDEA is reauthorized and the funding process for our programs is completed.  But know that you are a very valuable part of this process, and we in DPP appreciate your efforts!!!
