Children<br> and Adolescents with Affective 
Illness</h2>


<p>
<h3>Individual, family, and environmental counseling</h3>
<blockquote>
Remove inappropriate stressors: Use bypass strategies; demands and tasks 
in keeping with the young  person's facilities. 
<p>Informative: Emphasis on genetics, biology, and maturation with 
potential cycles. 
<p>Educative: Emphasis on what is known and not known; avoid 
rationalization and misinformation. 
<p>Supportive: Be a positive advocate. 
<p>Reassuring: A treatable and self-limiting condition with anticipation 
of long periods of well states. 
<p>Assist with order and planning: Toward school, work, play, and pursuit 
of assets and talents. 
<p>Assist with decision making "Continue usual pursuits"; "Do not drop 
out." Cognitive coaching on a  "mini" daily basis: "Learn to think 
positive _ act positive."  "Come to know that actions should dictate  
feelings," "Intelligence should overrule emotions." 
</blockquote>
<p>
<h3>Psychopharmacologic treatment</h3>
<blockquote>
Tricyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, 
nortriptyline, protriptyline, doxepin, clomipramine 
<p>Newer antidepressants: trazodone, maprotiline, fluoxetine, 
sertraline, paroxetine. 
<p>Thioridazine (and rarely haloperidol - other major tranquilizers are 
not presently being used). 
<p>Carbamazepine.
<p>Lithium.
