HONGKONG DIARY: At this delicate point in Hong Kong's history, there are
strongarguments for favouring an experienced and well-respected legal
figure: A Suitable Candidate 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.64

WE welcome the entry of Simon Li Fook-sean as a candidate for Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Indeed,
we would suggest that, of the candidates who have presented
themselves, he appears to have the best combination of the
qualities that will be required for this onerous and responsible
position.

Perhaps we should first define those qualities. The CE should -
obviously - be a person of probity and acumen who has distinguished
himself in the eyes of his profession and has a respected standing
in the community.

The successful candidate must also go into this election well aware
that the position aspired to is no sinecure. It will be a taxing,
arduous job, made more difficult by the fact that there will be no
clear precedents to guide him, and any number of carping critics
willing to damn his actions and question his motives.

No doubt, even as we write, the knives are being sharpened by
various factions. The CE's every move will be closely monitored by
the media - both local reporters and the thousands who are expected
to swarm in for next year's ceremony - by the people of Hong Kong,
and by all those on the mainland who have the territory's interests
at heart.

We would also suggest that the person filling the CE position
should be someone of maturity, experienced in the ways of the
world, impervious to flattery and who has attained some distance
from the transitory tug of ego.

While virtually every successful person in Hong Kong has business
interests, the successful candidate should be someone who is
clearly not active in the business community, or likely to return
to an active role at some later date.

Trust: It goes without saying that the first CE of the SAR must be
acceptable to and trusted by Beijing. China reposes great faith in
the people of Hong Kong - after all, the SAR will have a far
greater degree of autonomy than any other territory in China. We
believe that the Beijing leadership will abide by its pledge that
Hong Kong people will rule Hong Kong.

But Hong Kong has been harmed by the tenure of its last colonial
governor. It is now obvious that Chris Patten was sent here by
Britain to perform a PR job for international consumption, whilst
knowing all the while that none of his political manouevrings stood
the slightest chance of ever being allowed to carry through beyond
the transition.

Nonetheless, Patten's machinations have left Beijing deeply
suspicious as to what seeds may have been sown by the outgoing
British administration in Hong Kong's politically green soil. The
CE will have to be someone capable of sniffing out any unexploded
bombs left behind by the outgoing colonial power.

But the first CE must also be someone who enjoys the wholehearted
trust of the people of Hong Kong. He should be someone who was born
here and whose roots are firmly embedded in the territory. To be
the first CE of the SAR will be a lonely job. It is not a job for
the weak, nor one for someone who would seek to appease Hong Kong's
new sovereign.

Conciliation is generally much to be preferred to confrontation at
such a sensitive time and it is in everyone's interest that we
abandon the short-sighted discord that has been an unfortunate
feature of so much of the transition.

But the CE must also be prepared to stand up and be counted upon by
the people of Hong Kong to defend the valid interests of the SAR
within China. He must be someone who is well-versed in the Basic
Law and is adequately prepared to maintain the rule of law that
underpins the territory's prosperity.

Simon Li has enjoyed a respected career in the legal profession,
ending up with his appointment as Vice-President of the Court of
Appeals in 1984 before his retirement in 1987. He maintains a
directorship of the Bank of East Asia, in which his family has
interests. However, while some of his activities post-retirement
have focused on community involvements such as the Society for
Homes for the Handicapped, educational matters and his honorary
stewardship of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, much of his energy
has been devoted to working for a successful transition.

Beginning in 1985 with his appointment to the Basic Law Drafting
Committee, and more recently with his heavy involvement with the
Preparatory Committee, of which he is a Deputy-Director, Li has
developed an intimate knowledge of the details of transition.

He evidently enjoys the respect of and a personal relationship with
senior leaders. But he brings to his candidacy something arguably
more important: a detailed understanding of Hong Kong's legal
system and the Basic Law, and an irreproachable reputation as a
judge.

On a personal note, within his own family he has a lawyer son in
London and another son who is an international news editor with the
Los Angeles Time. His daughter, as head of the Bar Association, is
both respected and a well-known critic of some of Beijing's
actions. Nobody could accuse Simon Li of being out of touch with
sceptics both within and outside Hong Kong.

All those who have put themselves forward for scrutiny in this
unprecedented process deserve our respect. There are those who
argue that, as a financial centre, a businessmen should be the
first CE. We would argue that at this delicate point in Hong Kong's
history, there are strong arguments for favouring an experienced
and well-respected legal figure.

COMMENTARY: SPECULATOR'S DIARY: An Ode to the Market 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By PUNDIT, P.61

ARE you a bull or are you a bear?/ Bet against Hong Kong only if
you dare./ 1997 is the year when greed does battle over fear./ The
voice of the bear growls but a thought: /Sell this market, it's far
too overbought!/ 1997 marks Hong Kong's demise./ Under China's
rule, should this come as a surprise?/ The voice of the bull
replies in disdain:/ "Listen investor, there is much more to
gain."/ 1997 is the Gala Ball's start - Hong Kong's celebration -
you must buy to take part!/ So, are you a bull or are you a bear?/
1997 - We are almost there.

Bethany Chan, Worldsec International

UNANIMITY of opinion is the biggest single danger for investors.
Let enough people say there are too few hotel rooms in Bali, or
that there is a glut of oil in the world, and you can be sure that
glum Indonesian hoteliers will soon be slashing room rates, and
airline profits will nose-dive on the soaring cost of aviation
fuel.

The commodity everybody tips to be in short supply is shares in
Hong Kong companies. Pundit's friend Fergy the fund manager says:
"We are all throwing money at the place. Interest rates are stable,
profits will soon jump, politics look great, the dollar is fine. If
Wall Street goes up that is good, if it goes down, that is also
good - more US money will come here. If you absolutely put my feet
to the fire, I might risk a few bob in Malaysia, otherwise this is
the spot. Can't think why I didn't buy when it was cheap."

For every buyer there is a seller. Carlton Poon and his research
team at Worldsec International have just carried out a reality
check on the Hong Kong bourse as the Hang Seng Index hovers around
12,500. They summarize the sell case thus:

 By historic standards the market is not cheap selling at around 14
times earnings.

The p/e discount relative to other regional markets has narrowed,
and the risk-reward balance has become unfavourable in view of the
uncertainties that prevail.

 Valuations here are stretched and profits growth will not be fast
enough to underwrite current prices. Earnings quality could well
deteriorate and earnings per share are vulnerable to equity-fund
raising.

 Wild cards that could trigger a catastrophic fall in the market
include speculation against the Hong Kong dollar, China's reactions
to any demonstrations against the government in Hong Kong,
corruption and breakdown of the legal system, large-scale illegal
immigration from China,

 Loss of competitiveness, due to most expensive property prices in
the world. Labour costs high and skilled workers in short supply.
Ports losing business to China and elsewhere and territory's
position as a financial centre under threat from Singapore and
eventually Taipei and Shanghai.

Worldsec ticks off the buy case:

 The market is cheap because the political discount imposed by
Margaret Thatcher's 1983 visit to Beijing will narrow or disappear.
That paves the way for an upwards re-rating of the market closer to
the valuation of other Asian markets;

 Hong Kong economic growth is expected to accelerate in 1997 aided
by a recovery in spending. The momentum will be maintained an
upturn in the China economy;

 Potential reward outweighs the risks of investing in the PRC. Hong
Kong was midwife to the emergence of China in the world economy and
will play an important and profitable future role in nurturing
growth;

 Structural change in the territory from manufacturing base to
service centre is a major plus.

Worldsec has been consistently positive on Hong Kong equities. In
July 1995 it was the first broker to forecast 20,000 for the Hang
Seng Index. The house remains bullish, particularly on the
political re-rating argument. It has fed the bull and bear factors
into a model which produces a Hang Seng Index down to 9,054 at the
end of 1997 on a worst-case scenario and throws up a best-case
target of 16,847 over the same time frame.

We are taking a modest punt in the shares of Asia Securities. The
company was at one time under the stewardship of Australian tycoon
Bill Wyllie and the Lau Brothers. It is now China controlled and
has a major stake in a number of Beijing real-estate projects. One
of these is very close to the Imperial Palace and is planned as the
heart of the Beijing financial district. The project is 60 per cent
owned by Asia Securities and 40 per cent by Beijing Huayan which is
in turn controlled by upcoming IPO China Resources Beijing Land. We
have bought 50,000 Asia Securities at $2.275. To raise a little
cash, out go half the long-term holding in Fountain Set, where the
performance has been boring.

ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Tourism Receipts Rising 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

HONG KONG'S earnings from tourism jumped 17.6 per cent in the first
six months of this year to $40.9 billion on a 15.8 per cent
increase in visitors to the territory over the same period last
year. The Hong Tourist Association is forecasting a record $85
billion in earnings from tourism for 1996 as a whole.

Among the 6.44 million visitors in the first six months, north
Asians were the biggest spender, splashing out $9.3 billion, up
37.6 per cent year-on-year, followed by mainlanders, who spent $7.9
billion, up 20.8 per cent.

ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Hold Your Horsepower 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

WAIT. It may not be over. Scarcely had shareholders in Cepa
finished counting their winnings from the $18.50 a share takeover
bid from Atlanta-based Southern Power, than another possible
counter-bidder emerged.

Typically, the news broke in the press first. Confirmation came
yesterday from Hopewell chief Gordon Wu who said the company had
received "an approach from one third party for the possible
acquisition of a controlling interest in Cepa." His statement
added: "The board would like to emphasize that no offer or formal
proposal has been received from an independent third party."
Investors were advised to tread with caution.

The news sparked heavy trading in Cepa on the stock market where
8.3 million shares changed hands at prices up to $18.10. The price
slipped back to be 10 cents up by the close, at $17.95, with
traders disinclined to believe a takeover battle will break out
over Cepa.

The current discount to the bid price represents the time it would
take to get the takeover cash, together with the slim chance that
stockholders will vote to reject the offer. A spokesman for
Southern in Hong Kong said the company had no comment to make other
than to say it was hopeful that its agreement to acquire control of

ANY OTHER BUSINESS: Fun of the Fair 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

CHINA's export boom has forced the organizers of the Guangzhou fair
to move the event to a bigger location. Trade officials say this
week's autumn session of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair could
have attracted some 200,000 exhibitors, but had room for only 6,000
booths.

The new arena will be triple the size of the existing venue with at
least 500,000 square metres of floor space, vice-minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation Shi Guangsheng told the
China Daily.

ANY OTHER BUSINESS: ADB Approved 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

ASIAN Development Bank is set to become the first foreign bank to
buy into one of China's state-controlled commercial banks by taking
a three to five per cent stake in Everbright Bank of China. The
deal has already been approved by the People's Bank of China.

Chinese regulations permit foreign investors to buy up to 10 per
cent of a Chinese financial institution and sources say ADB has
been encouraged by the central bank to buy into Everbright. Founded
in 1992, Everbright is a subsidiary of state conglomerate China
Everbright Group and had net assets worth 1.68 billion yuan as of
the end of last year. ADB's investment is part of a share
restructuring plan Everbright is conducting to increase its assets
to about 4 billion yuan. The Chinese bank has also said that it
plans to list at some point in the future and increase its branch
network on the mainland from seven to 15-17 outlets within a few
years.

Manila-based ADB, which provides loans for emerging Asian
economies, is a member of a bank consortium that holds a 25 per
cent stake in Xiamen International Bank, a joint venture. It is
also buying into three small Indian banks. Neither ADB nor
Everbright officials would disclose the size of its latest
investment.

P.60

RICHARD Li's Singapore-listed Pacific Century Regional Developments
is taking an 85 per cent interest in a 400 acre township
development project in Huangjinwei Farm near Guangzhou.

The farm is currently owned by Hua Ken Industry and Commerce Co, a
state-owned enterprise of the municipal government and the Chinese
joint-venture partner. The farm will become a large residential
community over three years with construction beginning at the end
of this year.

Phase one of the project has an estimated cost of 400 million yuan.
The project is expected to develop 2 million sq ft of low cost
housing on 21 acres of land, 13 kilometres north of Guangzhou.

A Pacific spokesman says the group's other China project, a
building related to the mass transit project in Beijing is still on
hold because the site has not been delivered. Pacific Century is
engaged in an office-commercial-residential development in Bombay
and the construction and operation of a power plant in Gaoyao,
Guangdong province.

COMMENTARY: AROUND THE SQUARE: No Ifs or Butts 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By MALCOLM SURRY, P.59

COUNSEL for industrialist Leung Wah-chai, who was found guilty of
insider trading this week, asked the Insider Dealing Tribunal to go
easy on his client because he was "an honorary citizen in China."
Leung and his sister-in-law Butt Chin-han were found to have used a
network of offshore companies to unload more than 12 million shares
in audio-cassette maker Yanion International Holdings in May 1993 -
directly in front of news of a profits crash.

Lawyer Terry Poon asked the tribunal not to impose a ban of more
than six months on Leung being a company director because it was
vital that he be at the helm of Yanion through the 1997 handover.
He said Leung ran 78 enterprises employing 3,000 people in the PRC.

During the hearing Leung - whose assets have been put in excess of
$180 million- blamed bad legal advice he had received about share
trading regulations. He noted that he was educated to primary six
in China and had only one-year English schooling in Hong Kong.

This is not the first time Leung seems to have received bad advice.
Leung and Madam Butt were discovered to have carried out improper
dealings in Yanion through an offshore vehicle back at the time of
the public listing in 1991. SFC investigators found that a shell
company in the British Virgin Islands had been used to funnel $108
million for initial subscription and $31.5 million for share
trading to support the price in the first few days after the
flotation. This activity helped conceal the fact that less than the
statutory 25 per cent of Yanion's capital was in the hands of
genuine minority shareholders.

Yanion was one of half a dozen companies named in the scandal
involving the Standard Chartered Asia investment bank. It was found
that the then stockbroking arm of Standard Chartered had advanced
substantial sums of money to major shareholders and their nominees
in companies going public. The facilities were used to artificially
inflate the oversubscription level and to manipulate the market in
the shares when they commenced trading.

Leung and his sister-in-law, along with another director Leung Tai-
shing, were publicly censured by the stock exchange in December
1994 for the 1991 dealings. It would appear that Leung has been
skating on thin ice for some time.

There are those who would put a political spin on the mitigation
argument put forward in the Yanion case. I do not see it that way.
Certainly his counsel gilded the lily by suggesting his client was
"revered" in China. But he was entitled to raise Leung's position
in the business community and the fact that he is apparently a
substantial employer. Since the majority of Hong Kong companies
have investments in the PRC, and cross-border commercial
transactions have become the norm, insider dealing cases are as
likely to have a China connection than not. Politics are
irrelevant.

In fact a case has just started in which it is alleged that
Taiwanese businessman Hwang Chou-shiuan bought shares in the
Parkview property group in Hong Kong in the hope of making a profit
from his knowledge that China International United Petroleum and
Chemical Co was buying a big chunk of the company.

The tribunal will hand down its penalty decision in the Yanion
matter next week. Leung faces having to cough up some $4.35 million
- three times the amount of the loss he was judged to have avoided
by dumping shares. Imposition of the maximum five-year embargo from
being a company director would put him in the same category as
maestro fraudster George Tan. That might be a bit over the top.

I have no idea how prevalent insider dealing is on China's domestic
stock markets. What I do know is that Beijing securities regulators
take a very dim view of the practice. When they eventually codify
national laws for malpractice, the penalties are likely to be
severe. Hong Kong share manipulators might well have cause to
congratulate themselves that their transgressions are dealt with on
this side of the border.

WE HAVE not heard much lately about the mooted second board for
small companies in Hong Kong. The perhaps more innovative Kuala
Lumpur exchange hung out its shingle for speculative companies,
capitalized as small as US$2 million, nearly three years ago. The
KLSE second board index has doubled to 620 this year and tripled
since 1994.

Jardine Fleming tut-tuts over this in its latest unit trust
newsletter and describes the speculative little market as a "death
trap." That is perhaps going a bit far. The relatively meaningless
price/earnings ratio stands at 420, and recent Bank Negra action to
raise deposit levels for margin trading will no doubt hose things
down.

Jardine Fleming says "highly unprofitable" small Malaysian
companies have raised $1 billion on the "rumour-led" market this
year. No doubt many of these companies will disappear up the
Swanee, and the management of some may be probity-challenged.

At least the little bourse provides a venture capital avenue
somewhat lacking in Hong Kong. The banks here would require your
first-born child as collateral before lending money to back a smart
idea. The stock exchange requires a three-year profit track record
from IPOs, and it only seems to grant a waiver to China
infrastructure companies. Knocking on the door of the Nasdaq market
in the US is not yet a proven route to riches for Hong Kong
players.

That leaves the extended Chinese family as the source for raising
capital for a new business - if Uncle Chan-wah is tapped out this
year, tough luck.

Not withstanding all this, I find it hard to support the notion of
a nursery for corporate toddlers in the territory. Having seen what
the manipulators can do with the first board, the blood runs cold
imagining what they might do with a second.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: CATERING: Harry Ramsden's May Bring Batter to
Beijing: Move into China mooted for chippie group 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From PETER MOSLEY in London, P.57-58

ENCOURAGED by the success of its Hong Kong restaurant, Harry
Ramsden's, the up-market fish-and-chips group, is planning to
expand into China next year.

Executive Chairman John Barnes says he is looking to open two or
three outlets there within two years and is considering Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou.

"Next year seems a marvellous time to expand out of Hong Kong into
China," he says.

Window has also learned that Harry Ramsden's has put in a bid for a
restaurant site at Chep Lap Kok airport, which it will operate as a
joint venture. This would be its second Hong Kong restaurant,
building on the success of the first one in Queen's Road East,
which is one of the most profitable in the group.

Its partner would probably be Compass Group, with which it already
operates a Harry Ramsden's at Heathrow airport, London.

Details of the proposed move into China are still being worked out,
says a spokesman for the group. They form part of an outside
feasibility study now nearing completion for a broad expansion at
home and abroad, heady stuff for a group that has grown from a dour
back street in a Yorkshire town to see its shares riding high on
the London Stock Exchange.

For Barnes, it just goes to show that what used to be thought of as
a very British acquired taste can tickle palates around the world.
He is sure that fish-and-chips will soon be as international as
hamburgers, pizza or sweet-and-sour pork.

Barnes is untroubled by any fears that Chinese officialdom might
view the advance of a British fish-and-chips chain as gastronomic
neo-colonialism, and put up obstacles.

"The Chinese love Western brand names," he says.

Besides that, Chinese diners rather like a touch of opulence - and
Harry Ramsden's, its trademark chandeliers, white tablecloths and
waiters belying the traditionally working-class fare of fish-and-
chips, is certainly posh, if not opulent.

"The restaurant in Hong Kong has been a huge success and it is
logical that we should capitalize on that," says Barnes.

At first, most of the customers in Hong Kong were expatriates.
These days, though, Chinese customers outnumber them three-to-one,
even though the menu holds only one rice dish.

New dish: Although fish-and chips is generally ranked with roast
beef and Yorkshire pudding as a classic British national dish the
combination is, in fact, relatively new.

Fried fish appears to have made its public debut as a convenience
food back in the London of the 1830s, at about the same time Queen
Victoria ascended the throne and the British Empire was stretching
its muscles around the world.

But according to Frying Tonight, a history of fish and chips, whose
unlikely author was the late BBC Religious Affairs correspondent
Gerald Priestland, chips did not appear until 50 years later when
Britain started importing deep-fryers from France.

For long years after that, until 1940, the throat-catching odour
from corner fish-and-chip shops, or "chippies" - also known in the
North of England as "chip oils" - caused their operation to be
officially designated "an offensive trade," along with blood-
boilers and gut-scrapers, respectively selling black sausage and
tripe-and-onions.

The pungent pong arose from undeodorized fats and cooking oils
bubbling away at often dangerously high temperatures (fish is best
deep-fried in beef dripping at about 200 C; the dripping catches
fire at 225 C.)

To stop the fish becoming fat-soaked it is first dipped in batter,
which also enhances the flavour and texture. Some fish-and-chip
shops claim to use special secret-ingredient batters like Colonel
Sanders' Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe.

Others, like Harry Ramsden's, put it all down to the freshness of
the fish and the quality of the potatoes.

British officialdom's disdain for fish-and-chips was abandoned at
the start of World War II when it was realized that here was a
wholesome, high-energy and relatively cheap dish, using local
resources and very suitable for consumption by a workforce whose
general health was vital to the success of the war effort.

Popular: The munching masses, anyway, had always ignored such
questions of image and continued to queue nightly to buy fish-and-
chips, smothered in salt and vinegar to kill the grease and wrapped
unhygienically in smudgy old newspaper.

This wrapping practice is a thing of the past since Britain entered
the squeaky-clean European Union. The bureaucrats in Brussels threw
up their hands (or maybe just threw up) at the idea of anyone
eating cod coated in printer's ink.

These days, many fish-and-chips shops in Britain are run by ethnic
minorities, including Chinese. The product is as popular as ever
despite its high calorie-count and the challenges of hamburgers,
fried chicken, Indian and Chinese foods, and pizza outlets which
have gobbled up large chunks of the mass market.

Few of today's "chippies" fry in the traditional beef dripping -
vegetable oil is cheaper and easier to manage, even though it lacks
the flavour.

But Harry Ramsden's has stuck with beef dripping. With fears of BSE
("mad cow disease") crossing from the bovine to the human
population, however, it has started importing dripping from Ireland
and Holland.

Harry Ramden's first restaurant opened in a back street of
Guiseley, near Leeds in Yorkshire, in 1929 and down the years
became a Mecca for lovers of succulent, fresh fish-and-chips.

On Saturday nights after the pubs closed Harry Ramsden would still
be frying well past midnight.

Today Harry's son, also Harry, aged 72, is a only a shareholder but
acts as a "travelling ambassador" for the group, which has 15
restaurants in major British cities. The notable and frustrating
exception is London; each time they find the right site in the
capital, someone else comes along and grabs it first.

Hong Kong is not the only overseas outlet. There are Harry Ramden's
in Tenerife, Dublin and Melbourne, too, all places that can boast a
British community or heritage.

Barnes thinks he might open 25 new restaurants in Britain by 2001,
possibly as franchises but with the group holding at least a 50 per
cent stake.

He is also contemplating sites in the Middle East, including
Jeddah, and would like to move into South Africa and New Zealand.

It was the brave flotation on the London Stock Exchange in 1989
that provided the funding and impetus for Harry Ramden's expansion.
It also won huge publicity for the group - which still had only one
shop at the time but was thinking big.

Since then, turnover and profits have risen on average by 20 per
cent a year.

This week shares in Harry Ramsden, launched at 100 pence (HK$12.34)
seven years ago, were trading at 375p after a high of 438p earlier
in the year. Market capitalization has risen from 4 million at
launch to more than 40 million.

Much of the success is down to (Michael) John Barnes, a man in
total contrast to the firm's late founder. At 47, and with a smile
as broad and gleaming as Labour leader Tony Blair's, he is the very
model of a modern chief executive.

When he took over Harry Ramsden's in 1988 via a new start-up
company, Barnes already had experience as a brand manager with
Procter and Gamble and had also worked for International Playtex
and PepsiCo and as managing director of the British end of Kentucky
Fried Chicken.

He has now led the company through seven years of consistent
earnings and earnings-per-share growth under the banner "The
World's Most Famous Fish and Chips." All has not been entirely
rosy, however.

Demand for fish-and-chips tends to be seasonal and was hit by the
hot summer in the UK last year, while margins in associated joint-
venture companies were trimmed by sharp increases in potato prices.

But the group has ventured out into instant fish-and-chip products
sold in supermarkets, and a joint venture to create a chain of
fish-and-chip takeaways under the Henry Higgins brand.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: REGION: Exports Stifled by World-Wide Malaise:
US slowdown affects Asian foreign trade 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By SUSAN FENTON, P.54-55

JAPANESE Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's re-election triumph on
Sunday may provide a much-needed boost for neighbouring Asian
exporters.

While the Liberal Democratic Party's tenuous majority initially
prompted a slide in the Japanese yen, some analysts see greater
political stability paving the way for sustainable economic
recovery in Japan that will boost demand for Asian goods and
strengthen the Japanese currency.

The yen has fallen 30 per cent in real terms against the US dollar
in the 12 months to June, making cheaper Japanese goods more
competitive vis-a-vis other Asian exports and exacerbating a slump
in the region's export performance since the start of the year.

"The year-over-year impact of depreciation has already started to
moderate and should reverse with yen strengthening expected in
1997," says Richard Ligon, an economist at UBS Securities. A
possible spending spree by Japanese consumers ahead of a planned
increase in sales tax from three per cent to five per cent in April
could also boost business for regional exporters.

The need: They certainly need it. After a boom year in 1995 that
saw nominal export growth exceed 20 per cent in most East and
Southeast Asian countries the same countries face single-digit
growth this year. South Korea, for example, will have to adjust
from 30 per cent export growth last year to 7.5 per cent this year,
to US$134.5 billion, recovering slightly to nine per cent in 1997,
predicts brokerage ING Barings.

"East Asia's surprisingly rapid deceleration of non-oil export
growth in recent months has exposed the region's continued
vulnerability to global supply/demand imbalances," says Ligon. He
doesn't foresee a real improvement until next year - helped by
accelerated growth in Europe - and then only a moderate one. "A
better picture will emerge in the second quarter of next year," he
says. "There will be a recovery, yes, but not a boom like the
levels seen in 1995."

Hindering a significant improvement in the short term is a
continued downturn in the electronics sector and recent data from
the US pointing to slower-than-expected growth in the US economy.

"The US remains the critical factor for a regional upturn in export
growth," says Barings in a report. Recent data is in line with
analysts estimates that US economic growth slowed to around two per
cent in the third quarter, down from 4.7 per cent in the second
quarter.

Barings, however, points out that there are already signs that
inventory stockpiles in the US, which have curbed import demand,
are now being depleted and renewed orders for manufacturing goods
will prompt a pick-up in imports in the final quarter of this year.
"The notable exception remains the electronics sector, which is
still undergoing consolidation and is not expected to see a marked
recovery until at least the first half of 1997," says the
brokerage.

While this is bad news for the region as a whole, Singapore, which
depends on electronics for 51 per cent of its non-oil exports, and
South Korea, where the sector accounts for 35 per cent of exports,
stand to suffer most. "Singapore and Korea have been hard hit by
the downturn in the electronics cycle and that will continue for a
few quarters," says George Leung, economic adviser at HSBC Markets.

Singapore's non-oil exports slid an unexpectedly high 6.2 per cent
year-on-year in nominal terms in September to S$7.31 billion,
following a 6.3 per cent drop in August.

Korea, which is also hardest hit by a weak yen, saw its exports
fall 8.1 per cent year-on-year in September, to US$10.1 billion.
HSBC Markets, however, says that new measures introduced by the
Finance Ministry to help cut manufacturing production costs,
including slashing domestic steel prices and reducing prices of
government land for factories, should in the longer term help make
exports more competitive.

The impact of the downturn in the electronics sector, largely the
result of excess inventory build-up in the US, is now being felt by
Malaysia as easing demand spreads beyond D-RAM prices to
peripherals and related industries.

The electronic components industry, much of it shifted from higher
cost Singapore, generates 27 per cent of Malaysia's non-oil exports
and has helped it consistently achieve export growth of between 17
and 26 per cent over the past three years. The slowdown this year,
will result in a meagre 9.1 per cent increase in Malaysian exports,
to $80.8 billion, and 10.5 per cent next year.

Good for some: In contrast, the outlook for the Philippines is
promising. Analysts generally agree that it is set to produce the
strongest export performance in Southeast Asia this year, on 15.8
per cent growth to $20.1 billion according to Barings, and in 1997,
on 16 per cent growth. "As the Philippines produces very low-tech
products such as consumer electronics like television sets and
radios, it suffers little impact from a downturn in the cycle,"
says Leung. Growth rates are still well down from last year's peak
of 29 per cent, though, partly because of year-on-year declines in
sales of traditional exports like textiles, coconut oil and
footwear.

The only other country in the region expected to post double-digit
export growth this year is Indonesia, with Barings forecasting an
11.4 per cent increase in exports to $50.6 billion.

Indonesia is something of the odd-one-out among East and Southeast
Asian nations, as the only one not to enjoy an export boom last
year nor suffer a slump this year - mainly because its exports are
raw materials, making it less exposed to the global business cycle.
"In that sense, Indonesia's backwardness has been a help," says
Dominique Maire of UBS Securities in Singapore.

If that is the case, does it follow that as Asian nations are
moving into increasingly sophisticated areas of manufacturing,
export growth of 25-30 per cent a year is a thing of the past?

Not necessarily, says Ligon. "The era of export-led growth in East
Asia is not over, but it is changing," he says.

Increasing competition from lower-cost countries means erstwhile
sources of cheap labour like Thailand and Indonesia are having to
shift to producing higher value-added goods in the way that Hong
Kong and Singapore did before them. But that is not automatically
depressing their export performance. Indonesia, which has started
to reduce its dependence on textiles and plywood by producing raw
material-based but value-added products, is enjoying a mini boom,
doubling sales of paper products this year and increasing exports
of industrial chemicals by more than 50 per cent and glass and
ceramics by more than 20 per cent. The Malaysian Government is
promoting investment in the more cyclical hi-tech sector.

Thailand, however, has yet to make the switch. "The most worrying
country is Thailand," says Maire. "It has had the worst export
slump and requires investment in higher-value added products
because it is losing its lower cost competitiveness." HSBC Markets
adds that it also needs to invest in human resources, including
comprehensive training programmes, to boost export competitiveness.
"The government has also pledged that it will focus on enhancing
Thailand's export competitiveness by cutting tariffs for imports
and on raw materials for export-oriented products," says HSBC.

"It will, however, take a long time before these measures come into
effect." Barings sees

Thai export growth plunging to a meagre 5.2 per cent this year, to
$58.4 billion, from 23.6 per cent last year.

"Until evidence of an export turnaround is apparent, Thailand will
remain the lacklustre story of Asean," says Barings. Asean
comprises Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.

Like its neighbours, however, Thailand still stands to benefit from
rapidly expanding demand for exports from within Asia itself. "The
manufacturing boom owes much to Japanese investment, which has
facilitated the growth of intra-regional trade," says Ligon.

He notes that intra-Asean trade, for example, accounted for about a
fifth of Southeast Asian exports over the past three years, but
contributed more than a quarter of total growth.

Last year's export peak and this year's slump were both cyclical,
triggered by weak global demand, says Ligon. "Strong foreign direct
investment flows supporting manufacturing growth have not subsided,
and export growth is now coming chiefly from within the Asian
region," he says.

"These factors will provide a substantial cushion to Asian
exporters as they contend with rising costs and new competition."

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: TAXATION: Tax Reforms Take Toll On PRC
Companies: Revenue men get more efficient 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By TIM WILSON, P.53

THEY were down but never out, and now they are clawing their way
back. China's central tax returns have been rising consistently
since the tax system underwent a major revamp in 1994. No more the
wilting remittances that shrank the tax revenue from 35 per cent of
GDP in 1979 to 15 per cent in 1993. Last week the central
government released the figures for the industrial and commercial
receipts for the first nine months of this year. They are up again
- by 20 per cent. And this comes at a time when the economy is
supposed to have slowed down.

According to the figures, 249.8 billion yuan went into central
government coffers for the period from January to September - a
year-on-year rise of 19.6 per cent. And local governments raised
203.1 billion, 22.9 per cent more than this time last year.
Although the Chinese economy has grown at a rate only slightly
below this, the increase, say analysts, is largely attributable to
the reforms of two years ago - and it is a measure of their
success. "Since 1994, the policy framework has been set," says Qu
Hong Bing of UBS Securities, "but in terms of implementation, it's
a gradual process." The effects of this mean different things to
different people.

Networking: The process has involved the setting up of a national
tax collection network. Prior to the reform, provinces submitted
tax, which they collected, on a contractual basis. Since then, the
various taxes, and the responsibility for collecting them, have
been divided up between local and national collection agencies. To
achieve this, local bureaus were effectively split in half to
accommodate the new national ones. It is a change which presented
many logistical difficulties, not least of which was the job of
recruiting and training a large intake of staff. This took time, as
has the task of delineating more clearly the roles of the national
and local bureaus.

But the reforms are taking hold. Add to this the fact that the
government has been taking serious steps to chase up tax evaders
and to put an end to the contractual arrangements that have tended
to operate between individual companies and local tax bureaus, and
you have a situation where the fiscal net is noticeably tightening.

The central government will be gratified to have rationalized the
tax system, and to have ensured itself a more reliable source of
income with which to make a dent in the budget deficit, which came
in at 66 billion yuan last year. There is still the nagging problem
of intergovernmental transfers, however, which means that the
centre is obliged to give up the bulk of its receipts to subsidize
poorer provinces. But overall the indicators are favourable.

Nonetheless, if central and local governments are increasing their
revenue, it does mean that somebody else is paying the price.
Although China's tax regime has been and remains low in
international terms, companies in the country have been finding
themselves saddled with new and larger bills. Firms are getting
away with less, and this has had its own effects.

For local companies, says Chen Xingdong of Crosby Securities, it
was a contributing factor in this year's poor interim results.
"These were awful," he says, "and it is true to say that the tax
increase has been greater than economic growth. And you can add to
this that VAT is a turnover tax, not a profit tax. They pay VAT as
long as they make the product. These enterprises that are unable to
sell, still have to pay the tax." VAT was one of the cornerstones
of the reform. Nevertheless, penalizing overproducers is not
necessarily a bad thing.

Foreign woes: Foreign-invested enterprises are also getting caught
in the net. Many of them, says Tsang Shu-ki of Hong Kong's Baptist
University, were in the habit of bargaining for a lump sum tax
submission on a contractual basis. "They are under pressure to
eliminate that practice, and I know that some FIEs are complaining.
I hear that in the Pearl River Delta life is much more difficult."

And in general terms, the FIEs will be contributing an increasing
proportion to government coffers, not only because the collection
process is being revamped. The drop in the rate of VAT refund for
exporters - it stood at 17 per cent in the middle of last year and
now stands at nine - would not feature on these tax returns
announced by the government, for the simple reason that it
qualifies as an expenditure. Nor, as yet, will the ending of duty-
free machinery imports, which does not really take effect until the
grace period ends in December of this year. But both of these will
have significant consequences both for government revenue and
company burdens.

A recent report by the Economist Intelligence Unit argued that
these new measures were also playing a big role in keeping property
prices down. The higher costs of doing business lower net operating
incomes and hence market values. And this phenomenon is worsened by
the government's success at controlling inflation, to the point
where the cost of credit in the country has actually entered
positive territory.

So you have the ironic situation where improving macroeconomic and
budgetary controls - both positive signs - are actually depressing
the property market and stopping investors in their tracks. The
government urgently needs to increase revenue, but companies in
China could do without the uncertainty this brings.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: PROFILE: Strategic Advances in Financial
Marketing: Richard Tsang outlines new firm's role 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By CATHY HOLCOMBE, P.52

CREATIVE and outgoing, fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin and English,
PR operative Richard Tsang represents the ideal local manager for
international firms.

In an age when such firms are increasingly dependent on the
cultural and language skills of native executives, he also
represents their worst fears. For like many local directors who
learned the ropes in industries dominated by multinationals, he
broke away to found his own firm.

After building up Edelman Public Relations financial relations
team, Tsang left 15 months ago to form Strategic Financial
Relations Ltd, taking two senior account executives with him.

Strategic is one of four companies in a group representing a new,
homegrown force in political and media relations: the three others
are run respectively by politico C.K. Lo; radio personality Andy
Ho; and former Burson-Marsteller director Sam Lam, who merged with
Wendy Hughes to form a China relations counselling group.

Tsang took several senior account managers with him when he left
Edelman, but he did not storm off with a load of clients in tow.
"We only had three or four clients when we started," he says.

Following: Some of his clients have since trailed him, while others
turned to his custom-tailored services to handle new listings.
Besides special projects work, these days Strategic has 17 retainer
clients, mostly small and medium-sized companies that count on
Tsang's team to do everything from clipping newspaper articles to
writing annual reports, to arranging road shows or media tours.

The most important role Tsang plays is in making sure his clients
have investor followings.

If you're not a blue chip, it can be hard to get attention in Hong
Kong's family of nearly 500 listed companies. All his clients,
whether they've seen their share price fall or rise in the last
year, have healthy followings by local brokerage houses. Two of
them, leather trader Dah Hwa Holdings and plastics maker Ngai Hing
Hong, enjoyed share price growth of more than 500 per cent last
year.

"We don't tell people how to invest. We help people meet," the
energetic Tsang explains from his sunny office in Admiralty Centre.
"For low-profile, smaller companies, they may not know how to find
the fund managers and  analysts."

He points to the example of tissue paper maker Dransfield. Analysts
had a hard time getting too excited about the company that makes
tissue on behalf of Tempo, those packets snatched up for just over
$2 at any newsstand or kiosk.

But the company had plans to create its own brand. Tsang put
executives in touch with analysts who decided such a move was worth
funding and a Nasdaq placement was made, raising money as well as
exciting movement in the company's shares.

"You've got to feed [analysts] as much information as possible,"
explains Tsang. "And get them out for visits whenever possible."

Lively and loquacious, there are few subjects Tsang will not hold
court on. He is bashful in one area, however. Asked his age, Tsang
pauses before revealing the figure with a shy laugh: he is 30 years
old, a fact generally greeted with gasps of surprise.

"People guess I'm something like 38," Tsang says. "I remember all
those nights I never left the office until midnight. I say even if
[chronologically] I'm 30, I'm equal to a 38-year-old in work
years."

Tsang is the epitome of a generation which came of age at a time
when the price tag for the skills of locals began to match and then
overtake demand for expatriate talent.

He moved quickly up the career ladder at Burson-Marsteller, his
second place of employment after earning a communications degree
from the Chinese University, and later held a lead position at
Edelman.

A little serendipity also didn't hurt his advancement. When Tsang
was first transferred to Burson-Marsteller's financial relations
team in 1990, the ho-hum department had few business-specialist
media or even brokerages to whom it could disseminate company
profiles. But within three years IPO fever had gripped the local
bourse, brokerages were flooding the territory and local papers
were spawning expanded financial sections.

Today he has a data base of between 2,000 and 3,000 brokers,
bankers and media contacts. Most of his senior account executives
come not from a PR background, but from brokerages and banks.

Tsang waves away suggestions that breakaways by crucial local
executives are international firms' worst nightmares these days.

"It's not like the whole company left with me," he says. He simply
found his own little niche.

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: INVESTMENT: China Tops Survey of Best Emerging
Markets: Asia heads money-spinning opportunities 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From CHRIS JASPER in London, P.50-51

A MAJOR new survey into investment opportunities in emerging
markets world-wide has rated China as the most attractive of
developing economies, with others Asian countries judged to be
among the best of the rest.

The report suggests that more than three-quarters of companies with
international operations are now investing in emerging markets as
they compete to make the most of liberal trade policies adopted
following the demise of state-controlled economies.

But though it evaluates where the greatest rewards are to be had,
the study from Control Risks Group, an international political and
business risk consultancy, also highlights the problems and
concerns facing investors.

Based on 100 telephone interviews with managers specifically
responsible for their company's overseas operations, the survey
covers 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and eastern
Europe.

Leading: Asia dominates the report's top 10, with China heading the
league on a score of 7.2 out of 10 - the rating being an expression
of both the opportunities on offer and the pros and cons of the
operating environment.

Not that investment in China is a bed of roses, says the report,
suggesting that worries over the eventual succession to Deng
Xiaoping prompt concern about the time frame within which the
mainland will justify expectations.

The study also details worries about the Chinese legal system,
corruption, intellectual copyright, counterfeiting, theft, break-
ins and whether rural areas will fulfill their potential.

Yet despite the hitches, China has one unbeatable advantage: sheer
market size. With 1.2 billion inhabitants, it emerges as way ahead
of the pack in offering the most exciting opportunities for
business expansion.

"China's scale alone justifies the number-one spot," says Boris
Starling of CRG's business development department. "And were it not
for reasonably high risks, it could have scored a perfect 10."

Rating some distance behind China are three more Asian countries.
Malaysia ranks second in the survey because of confidence in its
"stable and focused political institutions" - although growth has
slowed and the economy remains  relatively small.

Third is Indonesia, with investors wowed by an impressive growth
record. CRG experts, however, express "concerns over the next
political succession" in a country where "politics and business
have been traditionally intertwined."

Next comes India, scoring points for its huge market potential and
ongoing transition to an open economy. Only continuing worries over
bureaucracy and infrastructure and the fact that it starts from a
lower base prevent India from ranking higher.

Thailand ranks sixth, "current political wobbles" not having dimmed
confidence, according to the report, although concern over wage
rates, skills and infrastructure could see some investors shift to
Vietnam.

Punctuating Asia's dominance of the top 10 are Brazil in fifth,
strong on communications, energy, infrastructure and the extractive
sector, and eastern Europe's two brightest prospects - the Czech
Republic (joint sixth and well on course for convergence with the
EU) and Poland, placed eighth despite the rise of neo-communism.

South Africa, where economic success has outlived initial euphoria
over Nelson Mandela's coming to power, stands alone in ninth, with
Argentina, Chile and the Gulf States all tied in 10th.

The most notable absentee from the upper reaches of the list is
Russia, rating only 20th, partly because of problems with organized
crime, inadequate legislation and political instability, but mainly
because of an overall failure to "turn potential into concrete
commitments."

However, Boris Yeltsin's re-election convinced 62 per cent of
respondents that opportunities would increase over the next five
years, although India rates top in this respect with fully 81 per
cent expecting an improvement.

Other Asian countries were among those which, like Russia, rated
not so highly, but were expected to offer more in the future -
predictions not always endorsed by CRG.

The authorities in Vietnam will currently allow investment only on
their terms, and the situation is likely to prevail, yet 67 per
cent of those polled thought prospects would improve, especially in
infrastructure and energy.

Burma, according to 11 per cent of respondents, will also show
improvements, but CRG warns against over-optimism. It suggests that
"blindness to the political consequences" of operating there could
leave companies open to "consumer boycotts and even lawsuits."

For Cambodia, 39 per cent of investors predicted better prospects
in five years' time, prompting CRG to caution that "there is little
evidence to suggest" it "will emerge as a productive business
environment."

Asian economics apart, respondents rated the Baltic states (53 per
cent) and some parts of the former Yugoslavia (38 per cent) as the
poor performers most likely to show improved opportunities.

The CRG's ratings and predictions are based on a survey carried out
on its behalf by the Industrial Research Bureau in June. The IRB
chose, at random, 100 of the 500 biggest companies with a presence
in Britain and operating internationally.

Sectors covered included aerospace, brewing, chemicals,
commodities, communications, construction, electricity,
engineering, food manufacturing, health, hotels, insurance, media,
metals, mines, paper, tobacco, transport and water.

Managers completed questionnaires asking them to rate the emerging
markets in which they operated in terms of opportunities and
prospects, fears and concerns, trade barriers, local partners and
other factors.

CRG collated the results, analyzed and evaluated them. The
resultant report, it says, is relevant to any business - Western or
otherwise - which has dealings in emerging markets.

Says Starling: "Our conclusions are based on the experiences of
British companies, but the rules apply across the board. I expect
the findings will be studied especially hard by people in east
Asia, who are always very careful."

The country rankings apart, the report's real value is likely to be
in pointing out the problems faced by those investing in developing
economics - and in evaluating whether common fears are real or
misplaced.

CRG head of research David Battman cites the main challenges to
such companies as "adjusting to often ambiguous business and
political environments, and combating problems of corruption and
organized criminal activity."

According to the survey, the greatest concerns of respondents are
political stability and the security situation. But CRG claims that
the security threat is often overestimated and "can be managed,"
whereas the degree of political instability is "crucial."

Environmental and democracy issues are regarded as much lower
concerns, but this, says CRG, underestimates their importance, as
they can lead to global repercussions such as boycotts and
insurance withdrawals.

The report also reveals that two-thirds of investors favour a local
partnership, but that at least 37 per cent experience some kind of
serious problem with their newly established joint venture.

In Guangdong, for example, it claims that foreign executives "are
far more concerned by possible 'official' abduction on behalf of a
powerful local partner than by the greatly exaggerated threat of
kidnap by common criminals."

However, CRG asserts that though businesses are right to worry
about fraudulent activity and criminal connections when selecting
partners, they should pay more attention to their political
connections.

This was highlighted recently in Russia, it says, when a number of
companies found that their local associates went Awol as they
jockeyed for patronage prior to June's presidential elections.

On top: Control Risks is, though, keen to stress that it regards
few problems as insurmountable.

"Some surveys just look at potential," says Starling. "That means
that people get paranoid when problems emerge. But we try to
evaluate both risk and opportunity - and we are able to help when
things go wrong."

CRG's 3,500 clients in more than 130 countries can draw on any of
its four main divisions: political and security risk analysis,
which compiled the report; confidential investigation, handling
problems including fraud; security consultancy, which provides
advice and, if necessary, men on the ground; and crisis response,
which helps firms cope with emergencies such as kidnap and
extortion.

The latter role betrays CRG's origins: its original incarnation was
as an adjunct to the corporate kidnap and ransom insurance policy
at Lloyd's of London. From that four-man operation it has expanded
to 160 staff in 11 offices world-wide.

The ending of the Cold War and collapse of old power blocs has
hastened CRG's rise, with companies presented with new
opportunities and new dangers - although Starling argues that the
problems of dealing with developing nations have been exaggerated.

"People seem to think that things are more dangerous than they used
to be," he says. "But that's not necessarily the case. Very often
you're talking about dangers in countries where a few years ago
opportunities did not exist al all."

Control Risk is, for example, aiding several businesses in Algeria,
which some consider perilous, while only Bosnia and Afghanistan
have ever been declared unsafe, and then solely in times of war.

"North Korea is perhaps the last closed state in terms of
politics," adds Starling. "And people are even trying to go there."

Ironically, while CRG finds that investors often magnify problems
encountered on the ground, it concludes that they are often
alarmingly blind to bigger threats.

"The world is wide open at the moment," says Starling. "But there
is nothing to say that it won't close up somewhat again in the
future. We're already seeing the return of communist regimes in
some areas, but businessmen seem to think that the clock can never
turn back."

He adds: "Neither will companies from developed countries have it
all their own way for long. There are going to be big firms from,
for example, Russia, China and Brazil coming along, and they won't
be subject to the same constraints as today's investors."

BUSINESS & FINANCE SECTION: TECHNOLOGY: Taking the Hi-tech Road: Government
centre nurtures real-time IT research 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By BRIAN TRUSCOTT, P.48-49

FINATECH Ltd - a self-described financial engineering and risk
management company pushing the envelope on real-time information
technology - could be considered one of Hong Kong's showcase
efforts to create what many believe is a much-needed but under-
developed, hi-tech sector.

The consensus is that Hong Kong has succeeded in making the decade-
long transition from a manufacturing base to a service-oriented
centre; services now comprise 83 per cent of gross domestic
product, while manufacturing has shrunk to 9.3 per cent this year
from 20 per cent of GDP just five years ago.

A key player in this transition has been the financial sector,
although people employed in wholesale/import and export still
dominate the sector; finance and insurance make up only  about 19
per cent of Hong Kong's total services industry.

Nevertheless, if a company such as FinaTech can be given the
fiscal, managerial and networking wherewithal, then perhaps Hong
Kong can be successful in launching some semblance of a sector
dependent on hi-tech R&D.

Second centre: The 235,000 sq ft Hong Kong Industrial Technology
Centre, which the government built in 1994 in Kowloon Tong for $250
million, is the forerunner of what is to be a second technology
centre. Price tag: about $500 million for a 350,000 sq ft centre to
be operating by 1999. Chief Executive Officer Dr James Liu says
these centres will probably show how a government can "simply
create an industry."

Liu says 45 companies will have set up shop by next year, and that
the addition of a new centre means more than 100 tech-based
companies will be operating under the umbrella of the HKITC by the
end of the decade.

FinaTech is currently just one of 20 fledgling companies so far in-
house. Company founder Eric Wong hopes his firm can benefit from a
local derivatives market that could and should flourish in coming
years - given the territory's tax structure, ease of trading, it
being a strong financial community already delving into the
fledgling exotics market and, as always, its proximity to China.

And this minnow - which originally started operations in Wong's
flat - has succeeded in attracting some significant partners,
specifically Reuters. The news giant recently gave FinaTech third-
party development rights, after initially being interested in the
company's 1993 prototype, Risk Rider, a program designed to keep
track of Hang Seng Index Options.

"FinaTech is the only financial engineering firm in Hong Kong that
has joined the Reuters Application Development Programme," says
Wong. The company is now in negotiations to perhaps include the
company's increasing number of financial software applications for
risk management in conjunction with Reuters' products - a move that
would save it expensive marketing and training costs.

The initial marriage between FinaTech and the HKITC started in May
1995, a few years after Wong and partner Arthur Man started looking
for potential business niches in the territory's growth in
financial instruments - options, warrants and various other
derivatives and exotics.

He says Hong Kong's derivatives market - in a holding pattern since
the mid-1980s - has only recently started to take off, gaining
momentum since 1992 when volume and liquidity started to fuel
growth. Business looks brighter now that brokerages have benefited
from a fat year in dealing with the booming market.

Wong has surrounded himself with a number of consultants well
versed in finance, marketing, mathematics and software expertise;
unlike other traders he has worked with in the past as a trader at
Citibank, Wardley James Capel and Credit Lyonnais, his sideline
interests in software applications and writing have led him into
the field he describes as financial engineering.

Wong's oft-published commentaries in such publications as Asia Risk
and the Hong Kong Economic Times as well as his seminars and
teaching have forged contacts and business for FinaTech. His
activities have also helped fund an enterprise that has surpassed
the $5 million mark in start-up funds.

By placing himself at the heart of Hong Kong's expanding
derivatives market, he has also been instrumental in bridging the
gap between the West's sometimes opaque options market for Chinese
brokers, again by giving seminars, lectures and writing books
(Options: a Primer with Professor Raymond Chiang in 1993, for
example).

"There has been trouble in the past in finding Cantonese [and
Mandarin] speakers on the subject; I have invented many of the
financial terms in Chinese," he says, adding that language skills
have helped set up initial ties with the Shenzhen and Shanghai
markets - another fount of business opportunities in the future, he
hopes.

While a handful of those also in residence at HKITC are financial
information-based ventures, the others comprise a variety of hi-
tech enterprises. Liu expects a number of them to flourish once
their initial three-year "incubation" period is completed - after
which time, they have to leave and "enter the real world."

The director describes those 1,100 days as a sort of "MBA on the
job," as the centre ensures that the company - apart from
developing the core business - learns an array of managerial,
marketing and networking skills.

There is also seed money involved, to the tune of $1 or $2 million
initially being doled out from HKITC's $50 million annual budget.
Companies which continue to expand are earmarked for additional
capital and, finally, a concerted move to attract local or
international venture capital if a company and its business ideas
continue to attract interest.

Besides FinaTech, Liu points at other HKITC occupants for bigger
things to come - SuperLogic Communications, for example.

The company is developing FaxMail, multi-networking systems and
Internet applications. Company representatives say that computer
fax means "directly sending and receiving a facsimile through the
computer." But in a local area network, one PC must be dedicated as
the fax server and a fax card must be installed.

"The key feature is the fax LAN software which controls the
hardware," says a company spokesman. Hence, its FaxMail component
is merging fax technology with LAN technology, highly useful where
there is heavy fax traffic.

The hope is that such companies will do what traditional
manufacturing-based middlemen did for Hong Kong years ago: attract
business and technological exchange from foreign multinationals as
well as China-based companies.

Nevertheless, Liu believes Hong Kong's hi-tech development will be
unique, unlike a Taiwan, Singapore or South Korea. Research and
development, he says, fuels any hi-tech venture. Liu says Hong Kong
will be used as a managerial storefront operation: financial
strategists and policy makers located here, with most of the
labour, both R&D and production, eventually being carried out in
China, or more specifically, the Pearl River Delta.

The reason is simple. China is starting to churn out well-trained
engineers in increasing numbers; a company can hire five or six
PRC-based engineers for the price of one Hong Kong engineer. Given
that China is just 40 minutes away, Liu believes Hong Kong's
comparative advantage will ensure that the hi-tech sector continues
to grow; China's elephantine presence beside mouse-like Hong Kong
also makes a consistently compelling argument.

It's interesting to note how Wong and Liu come to the same
conclusion about why Hong Kong has only recently seen the
development of a credible hi-tech industry.

Liu says that while entrepreneurs have the drive and a fundamental
grounding in various hi-tech disciplines, the underlying focus or
initiatives did not truly exist in Hong Kong until this decade,
when the government started making fiscal overtures for the
creation of a hi-tech sector.

Liu says the networking potential, seed money and simple policy
direction instilled by the government acts as a catalyst for
businessmen wanting to enter Hong Kong's hi-tech sector.

Formula: Wong says it has taken a number of synergies, such as
software knowledge and stockbroking expertise, to create useful
real-time risk management products for market players. That
combined with what the HKITC provides - everything from cheap rent,
cost-free air conditioning, free access to seminar rooms to
international trade junkets such as the one last month to Seattle,
where the itinerary included visits to Boeing and Microsoft -
suggests a winning formula.

Liu also suggests that Hong Kong entrepreneurs remain focused on
southern China, Hong Kong's true hinterland. Currently, Hong Kong
manufacturers employ fewer than 400,000 people in the territory,
but more than 3 million in China. That disparity should continue to
grow simply because Guangdong province - as well as the potential
business from two new railroads between Hong Kong and Beijing - is
a gold mine waiting to be exploited, he says.

"And why be greedy? There's enough in the Pearl Delta for
everyone," he says, conceding that for the moment, growth in the
province looks flat. "Guangdong is like Hong Kong 10 or 15 years
ago; you have to transform yourself and you need time for that."

AROUND TOWN: Ascending the Peak on: Double 9, circa 1930 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

THE "Double Ninth" was originally the Day for Climbing the Hills,
the festival when all good Chinese believed they must visit high
places. Today, the pragmatic Cantonese combine it with the Ch'ung
Yeung - the Autumn Festival, when ancestral graves are visited,
swept clean, and offerings placed on the graves (similar to the
Ch'ing Ming Festival in the spring). In North China, the two
festivals are observed separately.

The origin of the "Climbing the Hills" festival is obscure, but is
reputed to have originated during the Han Dynasty (220 BC-224 AD),
when a virtuous scholar was advised to ascend the mountain with his
family in order to escape an impending disaster.

Visiting and attending to the graves of the departed ones is an
extension of the all-important tenet of ancestral worship, serving
also as welcome family reunions.

The photograph shows a long procession of people ascending the
Peak, on Hong Kong Island. The small building, in the centre of the
photograph, is the gatehouse of the Governor's Peak residence -the
Mountain Lodge. The gatehouse is still standing, but the Mountain
Lodge was demolished after World War II, and a public pavilion
built on its site.

Several sedan chairs can be seen in the centre, waiting for
customers, and a few can be seen ascending with the crowd. Under a
temporary cover, refreshments are being sold to the thirsty
climbers.

AROUND TOWN: CHESS 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By CHEUK BO-YAN

China did well again at the Chess Olympics (this year in Yerevan,
Armenia) although the 13th place with 32.5 points (of 114 teams) in
the men section may not satisfy everyone back home. A few poor
results in the last few rounds was almost negated by an emphatic 3-
1 win over Belarus (with Boris Gelfand) in the last round. Still,
on rating China was only placed 30 at the start of this spectacular
biennial event. The other strongest Australasian nations finished
as follows: 19th Uzbekistan (32 points), 26th Philippines, 27th
Vietnam and 28th Australia (all 31 points), 30th Kazakhstan and
39th Turkmenistan (both 30.5), while Indonesia came 44th on 29.5
points. The small number of points difference indicates the
unreasonableness of the Swiss system being used, and at the same
time the importance of scoring well in rounds 12, 13 and 14; this
is often more of a lottery than a real draw. One of the PRC men
team's finer wins occurred in round 3 against Hungary with 3-1.
They then briefly occupied first spot ahead of Cuba, and even
consolidated this next round by beating Castro's team by 2.5-1.5;
the eventual winners Russia overtook them then by a hard-fought
2.5-1.5 result in round 5. Here the two games that showed that
China are on the right track. Hungary were rated third and gold-
medal winners in 1978. Peng Xiaomin on board 3 contained Zoltan
Almasi, while Zhang Zhong on board 4 also drew with up-and-coming
17 year old GM Peter Leko (see also next week). On board 1, GM Ye
Jiangchuan is still very much improving, probably because he
currently plays from Amsterdam as his base. Here he outlasted Judit
Polgar rated 10th in the world, and the strongest female player
ever. Of course he has met her many times before. White - Polgar

prospects in the endgame. Even more impressive was the win by Wang

AROUND TOWN: BRIDGE 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By PHILLIP ALDER, P.46

Last September, as we left a restaurant, my wife spotted the club
four on the floor by the door. (She's poetic, my wife.) When we got
home I looked in Right Through the Pack by Robert Darvas and Norman
de Villiers Hart. The deal related by the club four features
Sherlock Holmes. And, as the detective nearly said, "Come, reader,
come! The game is afoot."

West leads the spade four: five, seven, king. Declarer plays a low
diamond to dummy's jack. After winning with the queen, East
switches to the heart king. Declarer wins with the ace, cashes the
ace-king of diamonds and exits with the club four. West wins with
the ace, but South has the rest of the tricks - and 11 in all -
with the spade ace, the queen-jack of hearts and his four diamonds.
What is the contract?

Don't be misled by my auction, which reaches the right final
contract, not the one in the book.

The first deduction you should make is that diamonds are trumps.
Otherwise, after West won trick six, declarer couldn't claim four
more diamond tricks as he has no side-suit hand entry remaining.

So, is the contract five diamonds? No, because then South couldn't
afford the safety-play in diamonds, which guarantees only one trump
loser against a 4-0 split. For all he knows, West has the heart
king, and he will lose three tricks even if diamonds are 2-2 or 3-1
with a singleton queen. Could it be three diamonds? No, because
then South doesn't need the safety-play. Therefore, the contract
must be four diamonds. For the rest of the tale, buy the book.

Rossini

Peches de Vieillesse

Frederic Chiu

Harmonia Mundi France 907102

With his superlative technical facility, Chinese-American Pianist
Frederic Chiu could be a piano virtuoso of the old school. But
Rossini's Sins of Old Age and Liszt's arrangement of the overture
to William Tell are perhaps too similar in content and style to
reveal the man behind the notes.

It's not easy to convey the irony and humour of Rossini's little
indulgences for keyboard, written 30 years after he had finished
writing operas.

The composer evidently intended the 150 or so little pieces to be
frivolities, but Chiu's general demeanour tends towards the
pedantic and he adopts a kind of mock morose approach for the start
of each piece, which effectively torpedoes the music from the
outset. All seven pieces sound too similar.

Liszt's William Tell piano arrangement also misses, another
indication Chiu lacks the range to convey the symphonic original.

REVIEWS & PREVIEWS: FILM: Costner Proves A Winner on Links: Tin Cup 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

Director Ron Shelton

Starring Kevin Costner, Rene Russo, Don Johnson, Cheech Marin.

It would. seem that if you want to make a movie about sport in
Hollywood these days, you have to call Ron Shelton - who went
against cinema tradition and managed to make a film about baseball
that wasn't a flop (Bull Durham).

He also put together the charming basketball comedy White Men Can't
Jump, and the much misunderstood tale of the embittered major
league baseball legend Cobb.

In Tin Cup Shelton turns his attention to that most sedentary of
sports, golf.

Golf, by it's very nature, is not given to frenetic moments. It is
a ponderous and deliberate game, a game for those who like to
consider all the ramifications before making a decision, a game for
those who enjoy a wander near woods and lakes while the sun slowly
goes down.

And it is exactly this leisurely, relaxed atmosphere that Tin Cup
manages to capture while at the same time providing the beleaguered
Kevin Costner with the kind of role he was born to play. Costner
has too soft a face to pull off post apocalyptic warriors
(Waterworld) or mucho macho mediaeval outlaws (Robin Hood Prince of
Thieves).

In such overblown epics as these his lost-little-boy persona
becomes swamped and we lose sight of just how charismatic, in a
"gorgeous boy next door" kind of way Costner is.

Costner also excels in a role with humour. As he had begun to view
himself as a "serious" film-maker since his success with Dances
With Wolves, he has recently nixed humorous scripts. One supposes
that the trauma of Waterworld saw him just desperate to take on
more light-hearted projects.

And light-hearted (delightfully so) Tin Cup most certainly is.
Costner plays Roy McAvoy, a naturally gifted player who just
couldn't take himself seriously enough to make it as a pro. He can
drive like Daly, and putt like Faldo. If he could only do it on a
more regular basis, he would be up there with the best. But to be a
top golfer requires an enormous amount of dedication and
concentration, and Roy just doesn't possess those qualities.

Like a wayward Steve Ballasteros, Roy also has a penchant for the
spectacular, going for a birdie where he should take a par,
refusing to play a percentage game, even though a percentage game
might bring him success and riches.

Glory shots and entertainmen - that, for Roy, is what the sport is
about.

But now his tournament days are behind him, and Roy has settled
down into a life of middle-aged indolence. He owns a run-down
driving range in Nowhereseville Texas, where he gives the odd
lesson in between drinking beers with his mates.

It looks like Roy will make his way to the grave in such fashion,
until he is shaken out of his complacency by Dr Molly Griswold and
David Simms (Rene Russo and Don Johnson).

The former tickles his fancy, the latter, an old golfing chum who
is now a slick pro, hurts his pride by asking him to caddie in a
major competition.

Sure enough, Roy rises to both challenges, but, thank goodness,
does so in unpredictable fashion. He refuses to be tamed, either by
Molly, who would have him "extend his follow-through" a little
(what's the point of making a sport's movie if you can't use the
sport's terms for a little double entendre?) - or by David, who
smugly insists that the only way to win is to take the percentage
shot. Instead, Roy goes all out to win, both his lady and the golf
game of his life, on his own terms.

The movie delights in watching Roy take on the challenge of
seducing '90s woman and psychologist Molly in an old-fashioned way,
and in its climactic scenes, manages to instil more excitement and
tension in a fictional golf match than I have ever seen in a real
one. By the time its climax comes around, the movie becomes a real
nail- biter.

Director Shelton hasn't had a big hit in a while now, but with this
movie, and with Costner at his very best, he looks set to win
worldwide. What is more, by making his heroines intelligent and
full of character he is set to explode the myth that only bimbos
follow sport.

Dr Molly in this movie is as quick-witted and pithy as Susan
Sarandon was in Bull Durham.

It is Molly who provides Roy with the key to success thanks to her
superior understanding of his character. No cheerleader this lady.

All in all, a smart, exciting, character-driven comedy that should
keep everyone, golf fan or not, thoroughly entertained. Even if you
hate the game, you should try to take this charmer in.

REVIEWS & PREVIEWS: FILM/Martin Snape: DeNiro Is Up and Down in Thriller:
The Fan 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.44-45

Director: Tony Scoff

Starring: Robert De Niro, Wesley Snipes, Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn,
John Leguizamo, Andrew J. Ferchland.

Robert De NirO is doing an awful lot of work lately, some of it
good (Casino) some of it mediocre (Heat). In The Fan his
performance vacillates between the two.

Nobody does a "psycho" quite as well as De Niro. Has anyone
bettered his portrayal of a troubled Vietnam vet in Taxi Driver?

Has anyone personified violence better than he did in Scorses's
update of Cape Fear?

Here he plays Gil Renard, Mr Middle America, with a screw loose.
Gil has the worn outlook of a man who has too often confronted
failure. His hair looks like it has been styled using a knife and
fork, his clothes and brow are rumpled, his sales patter matey and
outdated.

During the film, De Niro sells: a lot of knives. He is an expert on
them. Big ones, small ones, hunting ones, combat ones, all of them
lovingly cared for and sexily captured on celluloid, thanks to
director Tony Scott's trademark glamorous style,

It's all very phallic, and once you've seen the camera linger on
Gil's highly polished wares, you know it's only a question of time
before he unsheathes one and gets stuck into cutting up a victim or
two.

And it's not long before you realize that target number one will
ultimately be Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes) a swaggering,
loudmouthed baseball player, the latest addition to Gil's favourite
team the San Francisco Giants.

Bobby is everything Gil always wanted to be. He is talented,
effortlessly successful, a perfectionist who can attain perfection.
Gil sees himself as a bit of a perfectionist too, the only problem
being that he isn't really very good at anything, not even at
flogging knives.

He can't meet the sales figures laid down by his unforgiving boss,
he has a failed marriage and an ex-wife who despises him (nicely
played by Patti D'Arbanville-Quinn), a son (Andrew J Ferchland) he
can't relate to and as a result, an awful lot of pent-up anger.

A degree of this he dissipates at ballgames, as during a father/son
outing to a ballgame where his anger continually bubbles to the
surface as he lectures his unfortunate child on the game.

De Niro's performance is perturbing, amusing and at times touching.
To see a man who is so far removed from what he wants to be is
poignant, and this is the key to the film's success. To an extent
we can understand the frustrations that leads him to be obsessed
with the arrogant millionaire baseball player, the man who
personifies everything Gil feels he ought to be.

But as Gil's actions become increasingly violent, he becomes less
sympathetic and the film begins to resemble just another
psychothriller. This, combined with Tony Scott's overly slick
images sees the film descend into areas that are the familiar and
glossy realm of Hollywood. Ironically, the more The Fan turns into
a thriller, the less it thrills and as De Niro's character becomes
more psychotic he becomes correspondingly less complex and
therefore less interesting.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: THE WRITING SCENE: A Shopkeeper's Diary: A
writer's debut on an outlying island 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By JANE RAM

When outlying island dwellers say where they live, most city
dwellers react in a predictable way. The typical first question is,
"How do you do your shopping? Do you have a supermarket?"

"We don't have a supermarket, but we do have Green Cottage!" Lamma
Islanders reply.

Within less than two years, the little shop on Yung Shue Wan's Main
Street has become an institution. Rustic wooden seats or the nearby
sea wall have made it a meeting place as well as the source of
everything from aroma therapy oils and wholemeal bread to steaming
espressos or glasses of fresh orange juice.

These days Green Cottage has diversified further, selling Birds in
the Sky, to give a direct translation of the title of  the $48 book
written by Queenie So Lai-chun.

Professional translator, former city dweller, dedicated greenie,
tireless farmer and full-time observer of human nature, So is the
owner and manager of Green Cottage. "I always wanted to write
something about Lamma," she says. "This funny community is unique
in Hong Kong."

Changed topic: She originally wanted to write about being a farmer
but once she became involved in selling green products, she found
herself spending so much time in the shop that it seemed only
natural to write about life on Main Street. The result is a
collection of short stories, which provide glimpses of Lamma life,
and the major concerns of the island's inhabitants.

Some of the stories are based on readily identifiable, real life
Yung Shue Wan characters - the Pizza Lady among them. Others have
been distilled through So's imagination and emerged in new forms.
Directly, or indirectly, everything in the book relates to Lamma,
she says, although less than a third is actually about keeping a
shop. Most stories touch on environmental issues. "I hope the book
will encourage people to value Lamma and keep it beautiful."

Three power station chimneys dominate Yung Shue Wan's scenery, but
instead of complaining, the long-suffering residents are inclined
to joke about them. So collected some of the comments - life's
exclamation marks, according to the philosopher; Salem cigarettes,
according to the chain smoker; blunt pencils according to the
professor; fingers with black nail polish, according to the
secretary; and so on.

Different viewpoints can transform the subject matter. So tells the
story of two Lamma residents, each with a big tree in his garden,
one to be doted over, the other to be torn down. Arguments between
their respective overseers ensue - to be put into So's record.

And then there was the 40-year-old who was proud to announce her
pregnancy - and her 50-year-old husband who arrived later to
complain his pension would be chewed up bringing up the baby.

So says hers is the first book in Chinese about Lamma, and it's
almost certainly the first book of any sort about Hong Kong's third
largest island. "Most people seem amazed at the idea that anyone on
Lamma can even read, let alone write," says So.

Birds in the Sky is boldly labelled "Islands Series No 1" and more
books are already in hand, including one being written by So's
partner, David Sheel, based on the diary of one of his forebears
who worked on the southern coast of China a century ago. So plans
more volumes of stories, although she says her next book will
probably be about the turtle who recently laid her eggs on a remote
Lamma beach: before anyone could really appreciate what a special
event this was, the eggs were dug up and eaten.

Main Street has certainly been an education, So says. "On the farm,
everybody I dealt with was so nice, it was like being cut off from
the real world, like being in an ivory tower. The problem was that
the ivory tower was getting smaller and smaller!

"The reality of Main Street was quite a shock. Suddenly I had to
deal with the real world of drunks and suppliers. After six months
I realized that it was impossible to carry the farming mentality
into the street. I learned to be more business oriented, more
practical and less idealistic to be able to survive. I'm not a shop
keeper by nature and I paid a heavy price for that lesson. I work
very hard, but I'm not very good at it. I've been writing all my
life and I continue to collect ideas and stories. I plan to do more
writing in the future: all I need is the time."

For the moment at least So does not plan an English version of her
book. "There are too many Cantonese puns for a successful
translation."

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: TRAVEL: Garlic Spells Trouble: There's no
substitute for metal at silver fest 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By PHILIP REEVE, P.42-43

A solitary drum began to beat. The simple rhythm, booming over and
over, soon became hypnotic. And then the air was filled with the
ethereal sound of hundreds of tiny bells jingling. One by one, out
of the surrounding houses, young Miao women appeared - dressed to
the nines in silver: magnificent headdresses, necklaces and thick
neck chains, bracelets, earrings, and tunics fringed with bells.
They surrounded the older woman, tirelessly drumming out the beat,
and began to dance in a slow, shuffling circle around the drum.

This was one of the highlights of the annual Sisters' Meal festival
of the Miao people, held amidst the camel-hump hills and folded
terraces of Guizhou's Shidong district. An extravagant courtship
ritual, it allowed the eligible young women to show off their
beauty to the men and at the same time their families' wealth -
invested in the fabulous silver costumes they wore. Families begin
collecting silver jewellery and headdresses for their daughters as
soon as they are born. Over 60 types of intricate silverwork can
make up a full costume including tiaras, coronets, combs and
phoenix crowns.

Wearing the heavy costumes for hours is gruelling for a young woman
but the more silver she can wear, the greater the prestige for her
family. Many silver costumes weigh as much as 15 kilograms.

All the men formed an admiring audience around the dancers,
preparing to make advances, proposals, and, for some, the
beginnings of courtship. The women prepare multi-coloured "sisters'
rice" for the young suitors, with symbols hidden inside to signal
their true feelings. A pair of red chopsticks means she has
accepted a hand in marriage; a garlic or red chilli, that the man
should look elsewhere; pine needles, that the man present silks and
colourful threads for further consideration.

The Miao people are surely one of China's most colorful ethnic
minorities, certainly the most festive. The "Black Miao" alone
celebrate 448 different festivals during the year. The hundreds of
different types of Miao in southwest China have been placed in five
broadly-defined categories - Black, Blue, Red, White and Flowery
Miao - though these convenient classifications do little justice to
the enormous diversity that exists in their customs, festivals and
dress (over a hundred prominent types). They are spread over an
area roughly the size of Germany and France, inhabiting seven
different provinces, though half of the Miao population of seven
million are concentrated in Guizhou.

Nobody knows their exact origins and this has led to a good deal of
conjecture. Some Chinese scholars have pointed to Tibet, Mongolia
and even Lapland as the Miao's original homeland. It seems more
likely that they inhabited the valleys of the Huang He (Yellow
River) around 4,500 years ago; scholars have even suggested they
were the first farmers in the Yellow River valley, terracing the
land to grow rice. The waves of invading Mongols from the north led
to a gradual migration southwards and it is estimated that they
began settling in Guizhou from at least the Qin and Han periods
(221 BC - AD 220).

During the Song (960 - 1279) and Ming (1368 - 1644) Dynasties, the
Miao were pushed further south into even more remote and rugged
areas by the advancing Han Chinese troops and settlers, eventually
reaching Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand - where they still live
today, known internationally as the Hmong. Allies of the Americans
in the Vietnam War, many of the Hmong were permitted to settle in
the US. Recently, Japanese scholars have been studying Miao customs
and language in detail as it has been suggested that the two
cultures may have common roots. The Miao of southeast Guizhou have
a much more imaginative explanation of their origins; the first
Miao man, according to legend, hatched from the eggs of a butterfly
(married to a bubble!); a water buffalo, a dragon, an elephant, a
snake, a tiger, a thunder god, and more abstract phenomena such as
calamities and ghosts, also figure in their richly storied
beginnings.

Exactly when the Miao started producing silver jewellery and
costumes is also not known but it is thought to have been during
the Ming period. Never having mined silver themselves, the Miao
purchased it from traders usually in the form of silver coins which
they then melted down.

At the time of the Cultural Revolution in the '60s, the Miao feared
their wealth would be confiscated by the Red Guards and so many
families buried their heirlooms in the hills. Luckily, that proved
only an interlude.

The central government, not unsympathetic to local traditions,
established annual silver quotas for the Miao way back in 1949.
Today, the "silver" tends to be a silver-plated base metal or one
of various silver alloys.

It is in the southeast of Guizhou, in districts like Shidong, that
the silverwork is the most outstanding and intricate. Many
villages, such as Tang Long near Shidong, have a number of skilled
silversmiths fashioning up to a hundred different types of silver
jewellery and adornments for their womenfolk. The Miao women, with
equal workmanship, produce exquisitely-embroidered textiles, often
full of colourful mythological figures and scenes.

In recent years Guizhou has opened up as an exciting destination
for the more adventurous tourist, and the Miao with their
extravagant silver costumes and lively festivals almost every day
of the year, are the province's prime attraction.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: A Prophet's Rise & Fall: New papers tell more of
China's Christ figure: God's Chinese Son: The Heavenly Kingdom of Hong
Xiuquan 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By Jonathan Spence

New York: HarperCollins

Extraordinary dangers may flow from a book as volatile as the
Bible, writes Jonathan Spence by way of an introduction to one of
the most amazing periods of Chinese history, the Taiping
Revolution. The prolific Yale history professor argues in his
latest book that more than anything else, it was one man's
interpretation of Christian scripture than turned China upside down
from 1851-64, bringing the Ching Empire to its knees. Spence echoes
many other sources when he writes that in the process, at least 20
million people were killed in battle or starved to death.

The author says he would never have contemplated adding to the
ample literature on the period were it not for the fact that about
10 years ago, new texts were discovered in the British Museum.
These volumes record purported visions of God and Jesus relayed to
Hong Xiuquan and some of his fellow believers. They also offer a
detailed description of life and events in China in the mid-18th
century.

Spence gained access to the books and went to Beijing to consult
with the man who had uncovered them, Wang Qingcheng. He decided
there was room for a book focused on Hong himself and the mechanics
of his enormous sway over thousands of followers.

Hong's introduction to Christianity came by a circuitous route.
Western missionaries were active in China in the 1830s,
distributing Bibles and related tracts. One Chinese convert, Liang
Fa, translated parts of the Bible and liked to give them away
outside the hall in Guangzhou where Confucian examinations were
held. Hong, at the time a schoolteacher from a small Hakka village,
happened to pick up one such handout on his way home after an
unsuccessful attempt to pass the exams in 1836.

Heady stuff: These random translations - particularly of Old
Testament prophets, the teachings of Jesus and the book of
Revelations - ultimately had a profound effect on Hong, who was
already sympathetic to the harsh lot of peasants like his father.
Following another failed attempt at the examinations, he grew ill
and fell into a delirious state on the 50km walk home. He later
described this experience as a journey to heaven where he was
reunited with his relatives, learned that he was the younger
brother of Jesus, underwent a heavenly baptism and was instructed
to banish evil from the earth.

By the time Hong failed the exams for the third time in 1843,
China's defeat in the Opium War had thoroughly discredited the
Manchu rulers and Confucius, too, in the minds of many.

Hong began his movement (called Tai Ping, or great peace) to drive
the forces of evil from the land and establish a New Jerusalem. A
handful of followers grew to thousands, despite incredible
hardships and setbacks and draconian codes of conduct, and the
Taiping took control of Nanjing as the seat of their Heavenly
Kingdom.

Spence takes pains to show that Western religious influence was
only part of the story. He asserts that "millenarian" thinking was
a phenomenon that evolved independently in different parts of the
world, including China. For example, until about 1500 BC, Egyptian,
Mesopotamian and Indo-Iranian cultures saw death as a final
darkness. Then through Zoroaster (Zarathustra) belief grew that
another worldly existence could come about following an apocalyptic
triumph of good over evil. This was the root of biblical
apocalypse.

In China, Spence points to accepted certainties first established
in the fifth century BC Lao Zi - paradox, balance and the absence
of dogmatism - later undergoing a similar erosion. Between the
third and sixth centuries AD, he writes, new Taoist and Chinese
Buddhist ideas combined to create an apocalyptic vision where a
celestial saviour and his chosen ones on earth would survive a
period of terrible destruction to form an ideal, peaceful society.

Even trying to narrow his focus to the inner workings of one man,
Spence must deal with a large cast of characters and many
complexities. He succeeds in bringing his material to life,
particularly through an inventive use of the present tense that
gives his narrative a journalistic feel.

Whether Hong emerges any more fathomable is open to debate.
Certainly the Western missionaries who met or corresponded with him
remained largely mystified by him, unable to reconcile his very
literal religious interpretations and uncompromising mission with
their own. Hong did not take kindly to their criticism.

But Spence does succeed in adding dimension to this historical
figure. Elsewhere, generally, he is portrayed simply as a Chinese
hero. Here, his fleshed-out story has the elements of tragedy; a
great man of noble purpose brought down by a fatal flaw. For Hong,
singleminded belief in his own infallibility bred dissension in the
ranks. That was his undoing.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: BOOKS: A Change of Season: Painful journey to
enlightenment: Bound Feet & Western Dress 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.40-41

By Pang-mei Natasha Chang

New York: Doubleday

I flipped through Bound Feet & Western Dress and put it down,
dismissing it as yet another yarn from some festering banana,
whingeing about being neither American nor Chinese. I remembered
enduring The Joy Luck Club, only to see a succession of characters
climb further down their navels, and concluded this cross-cultural
confessional stuff was spinning right out of control.

There was another problem with Bound Feet. It mixed the story of
one generation with the story of another, something a friend did
not very successfully accomplish in retracing the travels of his
great grandfather tramping through 19th century Europe. On the
surface, it was a simple "then and now" exercise, but it became a
game of matching wits, with my friend in charge of allocating
space. The device pitted one-off but sometimes eloquent
observations of a dead diarist against the musings, snoozings more
like, of a young writer who recast every phrase till it was too
clever by half.

As it happened, I inadvertently picked up Bound Feet thinking it
was something else, and headed for San Francisco airport. By the
time we touched down at Pearson in Toronto, I had finished the book
enthralled.

Rare for a debuting author, Natasha Chang neatly avoids both
problems, reining in her own story to the barest, thought-provoking
essentials, and using these to bridge different chapters of her
great aunt Chang Yu-i's fascinating life. Yu-i was the daughter of
a prominent Shanghainese doctor, a prolific dad who produced eight
children, including one son who would become president of the Bank
of China.

She was also, more to the point, the wife of one of modern China's
most celebrated poets, Hsu Chih-mo, who comes off as a creep in
this tragic story. But Yu-i herself was clearly a figure of
history, too, having been the first in her family to escape the
hideous practice of foot binding, after a few agonizing days' trial
- and being the first in China to be divorced. Unfortunately, that
precedent-setting split didn't seem to free her emotionally to get
on with other relationships. And unravelling the psychological
knots tying her up reveals the various cultural and social
conundrums that make Yu-i's such an interesting story.

Enlightened as her father was for the times, Yu-i was not given the
educational opportunities lavished on her brothers, and basically
tracked for an arranged marriage.

She didn't see her husband-to-be till the big day, and didn't think
she was winning much of a prize when she did finally lay eyes on
him. Hsu, going through the motions of honouring his parents'
wishes but really hungering for a modern, educated woman, dismissed
Yu-i as a bumpkin from day one.

If that wasn't a clue of more unpleasantness to come, we soon learn
that he rarely talked to her and stayed abroad as much as possible
before finally abandoning her. This he did a few years later, like
the guy who went off to buy a quart of milk never to return, after
she joined him to resume their partnership in England.

Son number one: Even the birth of a son, Hsu Chi-cai, and a second
- the tra-gic Peter, who was born in Germany and died at three -
failed to warm him to her. Indeed, he suggested she abort her
second pregnancy. But he seemed to dote over Chi-cai when he was in
China, which was rare. Chi-cai, in fact, spent his earliest years
with his paternal grandparents, as the story flips between China
and Europe, with tangents following Yu-i's brother to America.

After England, Yu-i went to France to live with her student brother
for a time before moving to Germany where, having nailed down the
essentials of German, she found work in a Berlin kindergarten. This
period in some ways seems both the happiest and saddest part of her
life. Berlin was where son Peter was born, forming the centrepiece
of her live-in friendship with Dora Berger. But that happy
interlude disintegrated with Peter's death, Dora never to be seen
again.

In Germany, Yu-i acceded to divorcing Hsu, desperate to marry his
latest flame and literary soulmate. She returned to China but
divorce didn't free her from familial bonds with the in-laws, just
as Hsu's desertion failed to spur her to act on mating signals she
got from a Chinese she met in Germany.

In the end, we have a woman caught between social and political sea
changes, prepared to explore the new, but not deeply enough to
leave the old, which includes a form of reconciliation with Hsu,
not long before he dies in a plane crash.

Hoping ties with her by-now Bank of China GM brother would pay big
dividents, the directors of the Shanghai Women's Savings Bank
appointed her a vice president. She proved astute in business, but
with civil war heating up, she moved to Hong Kong in 1949 and later
remarried. But with the death of her second husband in 1974, she
decided on New York, where she was to live out her days with her
son always close at hand.

There were probably many women like Yu-i trying to cross that gulf
separating imperial and republican China. The hope is they did
better than achieve what seems the worst of both worlds.

We are lucky for Natasha Chang writing Yu-i's story down, a process
that involved years of interviews and intricate interpretation and
editing.

A victim of racial taunts growing up in America, Chang found
herself on her own journey of self discovery.

But unlike most second-liners warming up rock fans for the main
act, Chang's story is compelling, too, laying out her own
conundrums. One suspects that at least some of them were confronted
and overcome in the process of working on Bound Feet.

ARTS & LIFESTYLE SECTION: ANTIQUES: First, Remove the Butter: Tibetan
furniture starts making its way to Hong Kong 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By HILARY BINKS, P.38-39

It was a painstaking process, gently removing the thick layer of
grime built up over centuries of exposure to the smoke and grease
of yak butter lamps in a Tibetan monastery. But gradually the
beautiful colours and gold leaf of the painted chest beneath were
revealed. Miraculously, the decoration was largely intact.

"A layer of butter covers almost everything in Tibet," says Shaun
Kelly of Zee Stone Gallery, "and in this case it protects the
valuable painting. The very dry climate in Tibet also means that
furniture can be preserved for centuries without looking old. As
long as you clean the pieces carefully and patiently, so as not to
remove the gold, you can restore them to their original state."

Traditional Tibetan furniture is the least researched field of
Tibetan art. While art forms related to Buddhism, such as statues
and thangkas, Buddhist scroll paintings, have been popular for some
time, until recently few furniture pieces have been available
outside Tibet. Over the last four years, however, a handful of
dealers in the US have pioneered the import of Tibetan furniture,
and now at least three Hong Kong galleries - C.P. Ching, Plum
Blossoms and Zee Stone - offer good selections.

Late market bloomer: Neglect of this branch of Tibetan art was not
surprising when one considers the practical difficulties and
expense involved in getting pieces to Hong Kong. It is one thing to
import thangkas, which can be easily rolled up and carried by hand,
quite another to arrange safe shipment of furniture from the high
Tibetan plateau first to Katmandu in Nepal, and from there to Hong
Kong.

"It certainly demands an act of faith to get the pieces out," says
Stephen McGuinness of Plum Blossoms, who has just held his first
exhibition of Tibetan furniture at his galleries in Hong Kong and
Singapore. "But my interest is both personal - my wife is Tibetan -
and professional. I have a deep interest in Buddhist art and I
think people will appreciate the incredible Tibetan craftsmanship."
Both Plum Blossoms and Zee Stone are also making the most of their
newly expanded gallery space to show the furniture to best
advantage.

The three main types of Tibetan furniture are chests, cabinets and
tables. Because of their largely nomadic existence, most ordinary
Tibetans had little, if any, furniture. There were no chairs in
Tibet, as the people preferred to sit on a rug on the ground or on
a low platform. But small tables, some of them portable, were used
to serve food and drink, especially butter tea, and the household
shrine would have a stand or altar table on which offerings could
be placed. Chests were used to store precious things and wealthier
households might possess larger cabinets.

Monasteries, centres of Tibet's wealth and economic power, no doubt
needed more furniture in which to store the vast quantities of
precious silks, thangkas and Buddhist scriptures they accumulated
through trade and donations. Some cabinets housed images of
deities. A smaller type of cabinet, the torgam, was made to hold
torma, sacrificial sculptures made from butter and flour.  Pegam
cabinets, unique to Tibet, had scalloped panels on three sides to
support heavy wood-covered Tibetan texts. But by no means all
furniture was made for monasteries, says Kelly. "I have seen chests
stacked up in private houses, and everyone needed small tea tables.
Apart from cabinets with a Tantric or obviously religious theme, I
don't think there is very much distinction between domestic and
monastic use."

In contrast to Chinese furniture, where the main focus was on the
quality of beautiful hardwoods such as huang hua-li , in Tibetan
furniture the wood was of little consequence. On one of the highest
plateaux in the world, mostly above 4,500 metres, the only timber
available were softwoods such as pine and cedar. Joinery techniques
were basic but still clever locking systems and hinges, always with
an emphasis on practicality and efficiency. Fittings were of brass
or iron.

The really important thing about the furniture was its painted
decoration. Sometimes the wood was covered with a soft cotton
material to prevent cracking before sizing, water-based mineral
colours and gold paint were applied. Many pieces also had gesso (a
white ground, like plaster) applied to give a raised delineation or
texture. Finally, pieces were coated with a shellac-type of
varnish.

Annie Marcz-Ching, of C.P. Ching, recalls the first time she saw
Tibetan furniture in Katmandu: "I was excited by the vividness of
the painting. When I buy, my first criterion is that a piece must
have life. That is, it has to be a painting, rather than just
painted.  When the painting is good, it feels completely different
from when somebody has just decorated the piece with another motif.
I was also fascinated by the different influences I could
distinguish. I could immediately see Chinese characteristics,
sometimes Indian ones also, and even Islamic elements in the
beautiful floral patterns - and yet the furniture is unmistakably
Tibetan. That is the charm of it."

Clues to dating: While no definitive guidelines have yet been
established for dating pieces, foreign influences can provide
valuable clues. From the 15th century, Chinese influence became
paramount in Tibet and many of the designs used on furniture,
including floral and dragon motifs, can be compared to those seen
on Chinese textiles and porcelain.

On this basis, Kelly believes that many Tibetan chests date from
the 17th century or even earlier, pre-dating more elaborate
cabinets which were more numerous during the heyday of the
monasteries in the 18th century.

But many features are uniquely Tibetan. Marcz-Ching points to the
painted flower cabinets, which she says are in particular demand at
the moment. "You can really see the character of the Tibetan people
here, very warm and cheerful. They love to use bright colours -
red, green, gold and blue. I think it has to do with the mountain
climate - when they see the flowers in spring they are very happy
and this is communicated in their art."

Chests used to store precious goods often bore auspicious
decoration associated with wealth, such as dragons bearing a tray
of jewels. Typically the central cartouche was encircled by a
geometric design with corner scrollwork. The sides of chests were
frequently painted with a tiger pelt design, believed by Tibetans
to possess protective powers. Buddhist emblems, such as the lotus,
the vase, and the endless knot, were also popular.

Tibetan Buddhism, incorporating the Mahayana or "Greater Vehicle"
school, Tantric practices from India, and elements of the
indigenous animist "Bon" religion, also had its own darker imagery.
"In this case," says Marcz-Ching, "what is wonderful is not what
meets the eye, but the symbolism.

"For the moment, people are only just becoming familiar with
Tibetan furniture, but in the long term, when they understand it
more, I think Tantric Buddhist pieces will represent part of a more
serious collection."

COVER STORY: A SEA OF TROUBLES 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.32-37

The territory's First International Symposium on Marine
Conservation gets under way in Hong Kong this weekend. Speakers
will address such concerns as destructive fishing practices,
pollution, increasing threats to biodiversity and low levels of
enforcement of current legislation to protect the oceans. Window,
which has regularly covered these issues since it was founded four
years ago, is a co-sponsor of the symposium. Neil Colclough reports
that the organizer - the Hong Kong Marine Conservation Society -
hopes to make people more aware of their stake in the marine
environment and the role they can play in protecting it.

UNSEEN and unsuspected by many Hong Kong people, there are deserts
scattered around the territory - beneath the sea. Years of
overfishing, including dynamite fishing, as well as pollution,
dredging and a general lack of environmental management have left
areas of the seabed a virtual wasteland.

"Divers in Hong Kong know there are hardly any fish to be seen," is
the grim picture painted by one local diver. This is particularly
chilling when the southern China region, including Hong Kong, is at
the edge of the world centre of marine biodiversity - the Indo-West
Pacific. Conservationists fear this diversity faces collapse unless
urgent action is taken. Species such as sea turtles, lobster,
several species of grouper and sea cucumber are already as good as
extinct around Hong Kong.

Trawlers working in pairs can regularly be seen ploughing the same
area within hours of one another, in some cases depleting fish
stocks below a recoverable level. Perhaps even more destructive is
dynamite fishing. Divers from conservation groups describe areas
such as those around Rocky Harbour, where the coral lies in heaps
of rubble, with only crusty species of algae surviving. Dredging
and dumping have turned other areas into swirling mud pits.

Until recently, there were few laws protecting Hong Kong's marine
life. Even though the government has now legislated fines for
dumping, critics point out that it is hardly enforced, with little
policing and usually low fines imposed on transgressors.

There are some encouraging signs: marine conservationists have
started to win a few battles. In 1992, a sand-dredging project in
Mirs Bay was halted in the face of an environmental impact
assessment of the potential damage to coral reefs, backed up by
extensive lobbying from green groups. It was the first time such a
scheme had been stopped because of possible biodiversity loss.

Sanctuaries: In addition, the Marine Parks Ordinance was passed
last year, creating four protected marine sanctuaries.

But such measures are not enough, according to marine
conservationists, who say more public support needs to be created
to force the government to make more improvements. They believe the
government's primary environmental focus should be to formulate and
adopt a comprehensive, coordinated plan to save the territory's
marine life.

As part of the drive to put the public spotlight on the state of
Hong Kong's marine environment, the territory is hosting its First
International Symposium on Marine Conservation at the University of
Hong Kong this weekend. Organized by the Hong Kong Marine
Conservation Society, the two-day event has attracted local experts
and those from the US, the Philippines and Vietnam.

The symposium brings together scientists, politicians, lawyers and
media representatives in an attempt not only to highlight the
problems, but also to offer some solutions.

Society chairman Dr Brian Darvell says there has been a tendency
over the past few years to restrict the environmental debate to a
dialogue between green groups and government agencies, excluding
the general public.

"People in general need to be involved in these discussions because
it is their quality of life which is being affected," he says. "Yet
all the lobbying tends to be done in the opposite direction,
towards the administration, and argued on technical grounds. Our
intention is to make people aware of what's going on, enthuse them
to take action and then empower them to take that action."

Given the state of Hong Kong's marine environment, much action is
needed, according to conservationists. While terrestrial
conservation began in earnest in the mid-1970s with the
establishment of Hong Kong's country parks, the marine environment
has been largely ignored until recently.

A government commission was set up in 1965 to study conservation
needs. It formulated a plan for both terrestrial and marine
conservation but only the former was acted upon, initially with the
passage in 1976 of the Country Parks Ordinance.

This lack of action, combined with the effects of pollution,
overfishing and dredging, has proved devastating, according to Dr
Gregor Hodgson of the Institute for Environmental Studies at the
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Essential: "Biodiversity loss is occurring at an unprecedented rate
in Hong Kong and southern China," he says in a paper to be
presented at the symposium. "It is essential to move forward to
implement a conservation process now, or there will not be much
left to preserve."

A major cause of this loss is overfishing, say conservationists.
They argue that intensive fishing over the past few decades,
fuelled by technical improvements to trawlers and equipment, has
left very few edible or larger species of fish in local waters.

Hong Kong fishermen now focus almost exclusively on "trash fishing"
- smaller species, such as sardines, pony fish and anchovies, which
are sold as feed to fish farms at high prices: $2.5 per kg. These
species are now also being fished too intensely, according to
conservationists, who say the devastation is spiralling down the
ecological chain. Not only are stocks of the smaller fish being
severely depleted, but the techniques employed in trash fishing
also catch the fry of bigger species.

Bottom trawling with small mesh nets catches high levels of fry of
such fish as bream, croaker and goatfish, which are commercially as
well as ecologically important.

"The fishing fleet in Hong Kong is far too big. Pair trawlers are
going through the same areas several times within hours of each
other," says Darvell. "How can we justify that intensive fishing
effort when the returns are negligible? This activity is denuding
everything in the areas where it takes place. It's just getting out
of hand."

Darvell and others argue that the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department has known for years about the decline of large fish in
local waters but has refused to admit there is a problem or attempt
to tackle it by limiting fishing activity.

However, in a report to be presented at the symposium, department
officer Keith Wilson concedes not only that current levels of trash
fishing are "alarming," but that few bigger fish are being caught
inshore. Conservationists believe Wilson's report is the first
public confirmation by a department offical of what they have been
saying for years.

Inshore: "The impacts of the Hong Kong fry fishing industry on
fisheries resources may also be unsustainable," Wilson's paper
says. "The low proportion of demersal fish [those that live near
the bottom] in the inshore catch taken by vessels less than 15
metres is indicative of very high fishing pressures."

The demand for trash fish took off when the number of fish farms in
Hong Kong expanded enormously throughout the 1970s. Today more than
1,500 licensed farms in 26 fish culture zones produce just under a
quarter of all the live fish consumed in Hong Kong.

The knock-on effect is that of the fish caught in Hong Kong waters,
roughly 80 per cent are trash fish sold to farms. Less than 10 per
cent are higher value demersal species, according to Wilson's
report.

In addition to overfishing, other capture practices are damaging to
the marine environment. Dynamite fishing also kills non-target fish
such as the fry of larger species, particularly as it is usually
conducted where fish congregate, such as spawning and feeding
grounds. Police fear dynamite fishing is on the increase: so far
this year they have uncovered 368kg of explosive used for this
purpose, compared with 15kg for the whole of 1993.

Also destructive is the use of vacuum suction and dredging devices
to harvest clams, a practice increasingly common, according to the
AFD.

The suction method pulls up everything in the target area, while
dredging - dragging heavy steel frames covered with steel meshes
along the seabed - ploughs deep into the mud, seriously disturbing
the environment. Such dredging has angered fishermen in Wong Chuk
Kok Hoi where most clams are harvested. But unlike dynamite
fishing, the practice is legal.

If overfishing is indicative of a lack of initiative taken by the
government in protecting the marine environment, some
conservationists also claim that even where laws have been enacted,
this has largely proven a hollow effort.

Earlier this year, areas at the bays of Yan Chau Tong and Lai Chi
Wo in the eastern New Territories and Hoi Ha Wan just off Sai Kung
Country Park were designated as marine reserves. Hong Kong has more
than 50 species of coral - as many as in the whole of the
Caribbean. Sixty per cent of them occur at Hoi Ha Wan alone.

As marine parks, the areas are theoretically protected from dumping
or other damaging activities. However, there is a grace period
allowed for fishing, which has angered many conservationists who
say fishing should be stopped now.

Patrol: There is also concern that there will not be sufficient
resources to ensure the integrity of the parks - police have
privately admitted they may be unable to patrol the areas
regularly. "Its no use introducing laws unless you're prepared to
back them up," says Darvell.

The government's environmental protection programme in general has
been marked by a lack of willingness to enforce legislation or take
the initiative in practical terms, according to Brian Baillie,
lecturer in professional legal education at the University of Hong
Kong.

In his paper to the symposium, he says Hong Kong has adopted "a
rhetorical approach" to enforcement of environmental laws.

Baillie argues that environmental objectives and policies, in terms
of the written law, are at least adequate. Similarly there are
clear enforcement powers and suitable penalties at the disposal of
the courts. "But the government has paid lip service only to its
own standards and powers," he says. "Its rhetoric about
environmental care is just that: rhetoric."

Under the various local laws the Environmental Protection
Department has the power to:

 License polluting, discharging or dumping.

 Monitor emissions and discharges.

 Investigate sources of pollution, including entering private
property.

 Prosecute offenders.

 In some circumstances, where the area comes under the Water
Pollution Control Ordinance, it can order an offender to clean up
or pay the cost of cleaning up.

But despite an increase in the number of prosecutions over the last
four years - there were 249 under the Water Pollution Control
Ordinance last year - Baillie believes there is an overall lack of
resolution on the government's part to enforce environmental laws.

Even before the EPD was given the power to prosecute polluters,
Baillie argues that the attorney general could have done so using
the common law remedy of public nuisance. "The fact that the AG
never bothered to do so, despite overwhelming evidence of illegal
discharges continuing for years, as with the Tuen Mun River, is
simply another indication of the government's tradition of
placating the business community to the detriment of the
environment," according to Baillie.

Even now, he claims, the EPD's own manual says that prosecuting an
offender should be the last option.

When offenders are prosecuted, Baillie says, with few exceptions
the fines handed out by magistrates are pitifully low and have
little deterrent effect. He says the average fine for environmental
offences from May 1995 to May this year was about $13,000. This
covers first and second offences - fines for repeat offences are
supposedly heavier.

For one of the most common offences of illegal discharge of waste
into public drains, the first fine is $400,000. For subsequent
offenders the maximum fine is $1 million, with provisions for
culprits to be imprisoned and fined $40,000 per day for a
continuing offence.

Baillie says heavy fines are occasionally imposed by more
environmentally enlightened members of the Judiciary, but the
generally low fines are probably the result of the lack of
precedent for environmental convictions.

When the EPD first launched prosecutions, the fines were low and
few if any cases went to higher courts, which traditionally provide
penalty guidelines to the lower courts, where such cases are
generally handled.

"So it is very difficult for magistrates, who hear all first-
instance environmental prosecutions, to work out where on the range
of possible penalties they should pitch each offender," says
Baillie.

Slows: Other critics of the government's environmental record claim
that bureaucracy often slows down the pace of implementing
effective measures.

So what is the way forward in the drive to protect Hong Kong's
marine environment?

According to Hodgson, there needs to be a move away from ad hoc
policies and action towards a comprehensive strategy to preserve
and manage Hong Kong's marine life. He says an "integrated
biodiversity management plan" would be based on zoning and tough
regulations to protect marine life. Following its implementation,
there would also need to be continuous and comprehensive monitoring
of biodiversity changes over time.

Hodgson says in his paper that conservation needs to be viewed
holistically - "from mountain top to seabed." He adds: "For
example, common sense tells us that marine parks should not be
planned in areas adjacent to heavy industrial zones, where the
threat of pollution will be high." He also says that conservation
needs to have realistic aims, with the assumption that many
problems will not be solved in the near future.

Survey: As a first and urgent step, Hodgson believes a fast
reconnoitre rather than a prolonged in-depth study needs to be made
to establish the state of the marine environment - what is left,
what has gone and what can and cannot be saved. This is necessary
despite the fact that such a swift survey might result in mistakes.

"Given the rapid rate of biodiversity loss now occurring, unless
immediate decisions are taken on what should be saved, then it will
be too late," he says. "The alternative, to wait until every
species and its ecological role is known prior to taking action,
would be catastrophic."

Hodgson argues that ultimately conservation, if it is to be
successful, cannot be restricted by political borders, and Hong
Kong will have to combine its efforts with southern China.

Closer to home, Baillie believes that changing the law to allow
private citizens to take legal action against polluters and the
government for failing to prevent illegal pollution would be a
major step forward in ensuring environmental laws are enforced. He
says such provisions in the US have proved effective.

"Indeed, the major victories for the environment in America since
they first embarked on their environmental legislation in 1969 have
very often been due not to the EPA's [the quasi-government
Environmental Protection Agency] vigilance or initiative, but
rather to the efforts, via litigation, of concerned citizens'
groups," he argues.

For this to happen in Hong Kong he believes three "foundation
pillars" are necessary. These are:

 Rights for citizens to sue both offenders and non-performing
government agencies.

 No awards of legal costs against unsuccessful plaintiffs in
actions brought against government agencies.

 Genuine, comprehensive, inexpensive freedom of information
legislation and procedures.

Baillie argues that a clean and protected environment should be
viewed in the context of basic human rights.

Linking all the recommendations and proposals to clean up Hong
Kong's marine environment, most conservationists and their
supporters agree that their success largely depends on getting the
general public involved. Not only does public awareness need to be
increased, but people generally need to be involved in the planning
process.

COMMENTARY: The ideal ruler rarely speaks. When a good thing is done, the
people will say 'We did it': Catching up with Lao Zi 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By GERALD CHEN, P.31

FOR THE moment let's forget about floods and the disgraceful
pollution man has brought to our planet's rivers, lakes and even
seas. Let us also pause to consider water - that life-giving
element as perceived by ancient Chinese thinkers more than 2,500
years ago. To Lao Zi (who lived around 571 BC), founder of Taoism,
water symbolized the very essence of Tao, the Great Way.

"Supreme goodness - Tao or Taoist - is like water," says the
Daodejing (one of China's great contributions to understanding of
the universe and humanity), which literally translates as Virtues
of the Tao, or figuratively as The Great Way. "Water benefits all
creation but never contends. It stays in places that most men
avoid. The Taoist prefers to be in the company of the lowly. He
does not err because he never contends."

In another reference to water, the Daodejing says: "Nothing is more
soft and pliant than water, yet it is capable of subduing the
strong and breaking the powerful. The weak can conquer the strong
as softness can conquer hardness. Although everyone knows this
truth, no one ever practises it because truth often appears to be
untrue."

As symbolism in the philosophical thinking of Lao Zi, it would
naturally be wrong to judge his concept of water as we understand
it today. But its value lies in the insight it gives into the way
our world moves and fulfils itself and, indeed, how human beings
should behave towards nature as well as towards fellow humans.

In this space it is unnecessary to go into what seem to be the
absurd extremes of Lao Zi's outlook, such as his vision of an ideal
small state which has absolutely no contact with its neighbours, or
his rejection of knowledge and learning on the grounds that they
are twin sources of evil.

What many pundits have found intriguing are the numerous glittering
sparks of Lao Zi's philosophic thought which still ring true today
- despite the fact that they seem contrary to conventional wisdom.

Philosophical opposites: A contemporary of Confucius, Lao Zi was
founder of one of the two most important schools of thought to
dominate Chinese culture down through the ages. Although a
personalized god is absent in both Taoism and Confucianism, their
ideas on what constitutes good government, virtue and the meaning
of life are distinctly different. In fact, they are opposite.

In the final analysis, it might be said that in the dialectics of
both schools, Confucianism, with its stress on studying the
classics and aspiration to official duties, takes a positive
attitude towards life whereas the Taoist position, with its stress
on inaction and affinity with nature, the meek and lowly, is
totally negative.

The alternating dominant positions of Confucianism and Taoism in
Chinese history have not obliterated the fact that both continue to
exert profound influences on Chinese culture. It is well said that
Chinese intellectuals prefer to observe the loyalties and ethical
values of Master Kong's teachings when serving as officials. Poets
and writers, on the other hand, draw inspiration from the subtle
feelings and romanticism of the Taoist gospel. But this does not
rule out the possibility of Taoist officials showing great respect
for Confucian ethics in their public life, while continuing to
relish their Taoist thoughts in private. Nor can it be overlooked
that disgraced or disheartened Confucian officials often turn to
Taoism to find solace in a quiet life away from worldly worries. In
effect, it really is quite possible for a Chinese to be now a
Confucianist and now a Taoist.

That the legacies of Confucian and Taoist thinking are part and
parcel of contemporary Chinese culture is evident from the fact
that traces of their influence can be found among Chinese
businessmen, Buddhists, Christians, artists, scientists and
communists.

Grades of rulers: The subtleties of Lao Zi's thinking are still
frequently manifest in his maxim that truth often appears untrue.
"The best ruler of a state," he said, "is he whose subjects are not
aware that he is there. The next to the best is adored, the next is
feared while the worst is despised by his subjects. The ideal ruler
rarely speaks. When a good thing is done, the people will say: 'We
did it'."

It might be argued in the present day that both the first and last
forms of such governments are democratic. Although "invisible," the
first case is effective, which is what matters. The last, worst,
case - while an adversarial form of government - is also a
democracy. But the first is an example of the effectiveness of
"doing nothing" (inaction), the most important tenet of Taoist
outlook.

The ways of nature are to take from excesses to replenish the
deficient. Man behaves the opposite way by taking from the
deficient to enlarge the excesses. The Taoist seeks to balance the
inequality by adopting the ways of nature. Although "doing nothing"
can result in "accomplishing everything," the Taoist has no wish or
reason to feel proud or jubilant. Simply, he has done nothing.

The wise appear foolish, great straightness bends, great cleverness
appears clumsy, great eloquence is short on words, loudness is
silence, speech is poor before ideas, and misfortune is the seed of
blessing (and vice versa).

Said Lao Zi: "When common folks hear what I say, they just laugh.
Why shouldn't they? Greatness comes belatedly. Great sounds sound
faint. Tao cannot be named. Had they not laughed, I would not be
talking about Tao."

CHINA: SPORTS: Warming Up to Sports: Fujian people's route to health 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From ZENG XIANCHENG in Fuzhou, P.28-29

EARLY morning sunlight finds numerous people in Chinese cities
jogging, playing ball or dancing in public parks or by the
roadside. At this time of day, all these people - of different
ages, various occupations and diverse interests - seem to be
focused on a single goal: achieving a long and healthy life.

Freed from the old worries about lack of food and clothing, more
and more Chinese, as those in Fujian province shown in these
pictures, are becoming health conscious and spending increasing
amounts of money and time on sport.

As with almost anything in China, the history of sport can be
traced back aeons through a colourful range of traditional
activities and styles. The Fujian area used to be called Min. The
Min people were an ancient ethnic group who were integrated with
the Han - the majority of the Chinese race - centuries ago. As a
result, many traditional sports, such as Chinese martial arts and
dragon boat racing, were adopted by the Min as well.

Today, many Western sports - golf, snooker, aerobics to name just a
few - are becoming increasingly popular with the younger people in
Fujian. Well-equipped gyms are being opened in many cities in the
province, attracting large numbers of eager exercisers.

The fitness trend is also fuelling a spending boom and sales of
sporting goods, including home exercise machines, are rising
rapidly.

Fujian's provincial government has spent handsomely on building
sports facilities and supporting sporting events. More than 400
stadia and gyms have been built across the province in the last few
years. The cities of Quanzhou and Xiamen have each constructed
large, well-equipped sports centres, ending their chronic shortage
of such facilities.

Local governments in Fujian are keen on waging campaigns to
encourage people to participate in both traditional and modern
games. Sports meets are held frequently across the province and
last summer a number of "thousand-people" games were held in Fuqing
city. In each of these events a thousand participants competed in
swimming, jogging and martial arts exercises.

CHINA: BOOKS: Unmitigated Butchery: Vivid re-telling of Nanjing's 1937
nightmare, when 300,000 died at Japanese hands 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.27

Nanjing Massacre, 1937

Xu Zhigeng

Published by Chinese Literature Press

ON December 13, 1937, units of the invading Japanese Imperial Army
occupied Nanjing, at that time the capital of China. They entered
not as a disciplined force engaged in modern warfare abiding by the
Geneva Convention and other accepted moral and legal codes that
govern conflicts, but rather as ravening foxes into a hencoop. The
soldiers, encouraged and abetted by their leaders, began a campaign
of slaughter, torture and pillage that lasted for months on end.

Informed conservative estimates of the number of dead conducted at
the time, and immediately upon the expulsion of the Japanese, put
the death toll among a subdued and captive population at more than
300,000, the majority occurring during officially sanctioned
instances of mass slaughter and gratuitous violence.

Appalling as this was, does this one instance in an expansionist
period during which the Japanese slaughtered and pillaged across
Asia, merit a book to itself? Or is this merely an example of a
citizen of one country caring more about what happened to
compatriots than to the inhabitants of Vietnam, Burma, Hong Kong,
Singapore and Indonesia, to name but a few? Many other accounts
exist which document the planning and cruelty that went into
Japan's thwarted aggression, including the preparation of spy
rings, drug dealing, subornment and cruelty in the extreme.

The author justifies his publication on the grounds that, once the
idea had been suggested, he found it remarkably hard to uncover the
facts. Despite anecdotal evidence from survivors, historians seemed
to have largely passed over the event. Indeed, as a second edition
was being prepared for translation and press, Japan's justice
minister went on record to claim that the Nanjing Massacre "was a
complete fabrication" - a staggering denial that in itself makes
the need for a record such as this the more necessary.

It would seem that, at a time when ignorant youngsters in Fujian
province are buying Japanese military replicas, when Japanese
right-wing militarists are gaining press attention, and when
textbooks are claiming that Japan "entered China" rather than
invaded, there is an insistent need to put the facts on record,
lest we forget.

Neither designed as, nor perhaps desirable as, a work of literary
accomplishment, this account tackles the topic in analytic and
dispassionate fashion, despite the fact that even the Japanese
translators "found [their] eyes filling with tears" and were often
"ridden with a sense of crime."

Ordeal: Opening with an account of the (inadequate) defence of
Nanjing against military superiority, set in a time of divided
loyalties and poor communications, the author shows the peculiar
blend of heroism and scarce resources that characterized the
Chinese resistance to the Japanese occupation. From this he moves
on with chapters detailing aspects of the ordeal, not in a temporal
chronicle but as an examination of each outrage in turn.

Despite the inevitable repetition this entails, the themes are
strongly buttressed by eyewitness accounts from different
perspectives, leading the reader from house to street to riverside
in a never-ending orgy of carnage, waste and inhumanity.

We learn of thousands machine-gunned, hundreds doused in petrol and
set afire, groups buried alive, and rape and disembowelment as
daily occurrences.

The citizens of neutral powers and the Red Cross tried to enforce
safety zones for non-combatants, but to only limited avail. The
streets and rivers ran red while property was looted, destroyed or
shipped to Japan.

Perhaps the most spectacular instances of unnecessary cruelty
involved the beheading of innocent civilians in competitions
between Japanese officers testing the edges of their swords for
fun, accounts of which were published in Japanese papers for the
amusement of those unable to take part in this savage apology for
sport.

But was this any different from other wartime atrocities? The point
that the author wishes to leave us with is emphatically "yes."
While waste and plunder have historically accompanied armies,
modern sensibilities have given rise to accords and regard for the
well-being of civilians under occupied rule: these were disregarded
pointlessly and comprehensively. It can be no defence to the charge
that the occupiers behaved atrociously by saying, as did Japanese
commander Iwane Matsui: "The struggle between Japan and China
should be regarded as the unavoidable conflict between two
developing nations, and the rivalry between the national ideologies
of the two cultures."

Modern proponents of terrorism as warfare might seek to justify the
Japanese behaviour, saying that by terrorizing the occupied areas
they were following militarily sound principles of seeking to
demoralize the opponent. But, as one reads further into this
account of the massacre, such pleas appear hollow and specious: why
adopt a policy of stupidity and waste?

At a time when nationalisms and ideologies again threaten to clash
in Southeast Asia over territory, we would do well to read this
account and, even if we cannot agree on what the ethical
considerations are, to call to mind Sun Tzu's observation, made in
The Art of War, probably compiled during the Warring States period
(475-221 BC): "Generally in war the best policy is to take a state
intact; to ruin it is inferior to this."

CHINA: HEALTH: Vast Majority Ignore Need to Clean Teeth: Toothbrushes used
by only half population 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By JAMES NING, P.26

IN THE West at least, it has long been as essential a personal-
hygiene instrument as a nailbrush. Infants as well as adults use it
at the start and finish of each day, and wouldn't dream of
travelling any distance without it. It's as prominent in TV
advertisements and print ads as on the shelves of pharmacies. There
was even a song written about it - quite a tribute for a stick of
plastic with a few dozen bristles stuck on one end.

Take a bow, toothbrush.

But while its use is widespread in developed countries, it is still
far from ubiquitous in China. Only about half the population of 1.2
billion use one, even though it was first imported from the West
early this century.

Old concept: Not that the concept of cleaning one's teeth was
earth-shatteringly new to the country. The well-to-do were
polishing their molars, sans toothbrush, with lumps of rock salt as
early as the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), though the practice was
never widely popularized.

Currently, say national public health officials, about 60 per cent
of China's 700 million rural dwellers have yet to adopt the use of
a toothbrush, while 10-20 per cent of urbanites also ignore it.
Then there are, at a rough count, some 400 million infants and
senior citizens who have no need of one because they have no teeth.
The end result: only about 300 million mainland citizens brush
their teeth regularly.

The fact that only one-quarter of the population actually do so has
for years been of major concern to dental and medical authorities.
But shortage of funds has hampered large-scale publicity drives on
dental hygiene where it is most needed - in underdeveloped country
areas, most of whose people have never seen a toothbrush, let alone
used one. Many rural folk who now clean their teeth picked up the
habit after seeing town-dwellers doing so.

Poverty is another factor that prevents people from adopting such
healthy habits, lack of money rather than ignorance depriving them
of these fundamentals. Equally, strapped-for-cash local health
authorities are unable to hand out free toothbrushes and
toothpaste, or to mount promotional campaigns. Meanwhile, the
majority of people continue to spend surplus money on household
goods rather than dental hygiene. Their teeth receive attention
only when giving them problems.

China produces some 800 million toothbrushes a year, the majority
of low quality and thus cheap. Those who retail them invariably
have large inventories because customers tend to use their
toothbrush for some years before replacing it. A snap survey by the
municipal product-quality monitoring office at major department
stores in the Haidian district of Beijing last year showed that
more than 30 per cent of non-brandname brushes had serious defects
and should not have been allowed onto the market.

Potential risk: Many users of these brushes are unaware of the
potential risk to their health - an ulcerated mouth or infected
gums, for example. But, say health officials, even much-hyped
imported and domestic-brand brushes are not necessarily of a
quality that justifies their price tags. And medical experts in
Beijing continue to warn that new designs, promoted on TV as being
"recommended by most dentists overseas" are not necessarily
suitable for Chinese, or other races for that matter.

Last month, reporting China's seventh annual Tooth Protection Day,
the Economic Daily carried a special report on dental matters. It
observed that moneyed people tend to opt for expensive imports in
the belief that dearer is better, while those on tight budgets are
often of necessity forced to disregard quality. The best
domestically produced toothbrushes, said the report, are just as
good as their foreign counterparts but sell for half the price.
Other points:

p Of toothbrushes replaced daily in hotel guest rooms, including
some top hotels, more than 90 per cent fall short of state quality
standards in one aspect or another, if not completely. This is
because managements keep such costs to a minimum.

p The report's writer could not specify the number of China's
toothbrush producers, but did learn that more than 30 are members
of the Association for Daily Necessities Industry. (Members of such
trade groups are usually major state-owned enterprises trying to
stay in business against the competition of far wealthier joint
ventures.) Combined, the domestic manufacturers would be a
formidable force; currently, most struggle by on their own.
However, several toothbrush firms in Wuhan, capital of central
China's Hubei province, recently formed an industry group to form a
united front.

p Most manufacturers have been making the same models since their
firms were founded years, even decades, ago. Lack of funding and
technical know-how has prevented them from launching better models
using modern materials. Those who have contrived to come up with
fresh designs in recent years have found themselves with little
capital left over to promote their new products. Many of these
match the design and product quality of those from overseas.

p China's toothpaste producers are generally far more successful
with sales than brush makers. Thus, suggests the report, the two
should merge their operations in the same way as their powerful
foreign rivals to become more competitive. But this is not possible
at present because the two sectors belong to different industrial
areas. Toothpaste manufacturing is part of the chemical industry,
toothbrushes the Ministry of Light Industry. Central government,
assumes the report, would not be against a merger.

CHINA: Move West Proves Yugur Salvation 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

THE Yugur originated from an ancient nomadic tribe, the Ouigurs,
which roamed the Erhun river valley in northwest China during the
Tang dynasty (618-907). Dogged by foul weather and constant attacks
from the neighbouring Turkic Kirgiz people, the Ouigurs began
moving westward in separate groups in the mid-9th century. One of
the groups emigrated to today's Gansu province, and settled in
Guazhou (today's Dunhuang), Ganzhou (Zhangye) and Liangzhou
(Wuwei). Because the three places were all in the Hexi Corridor,
the former nomads became known as the Hexi Ouigurs.

From the mid-11th to 16th centuries, many of those in Guazhou
assimilated with local people, thus forming the community now known
as the Yugurs. During the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), the rulers
moved a large number of Yugurs further east to today's Zhangye
area. Through such gradual contact with the neighbouring Han
community, the Yugurs started to learn farming and animal
husbandry.

Today, about 90 per cent of the 12,000 Yugurs live in Sunan Yugur
Autonomous County, founded in Zhangye in 1954. A small number of
them can be found in Huangnibao township, in the Jiuquan area that
borders Zhangye. Blessed with abundant grassland, most Yugurs
continue to work in farming and animal husbandry. Others are
engaged in industry, mainly carpet-making, the fur trade and food
processing.

CHINA: FOCUS: Minority Yugurs Profit From Old Cultural Ways: Zhangye resort
contrasts industrial base 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From ZHONG ZHENGXIANG and CHEN JIAN in Zhangye, P.24-25

BUSINESS people know Zhangye in China's northeast Gansu province as
a burgeoning industrial town. Tourists, however, are drawn to its
Lan Hua Ping resort with its picturesque scenery and friendly
Yugurs, a culture numbering some 12,000.

A recent tour of the resort, 3,000 metres above sea level, which
attracts about 200,000 visitors a year, proves a rewarding
experience.

Our approach to the entrance was to the sound of folk songs by a
group of young Yugurs in ethnic dress. Their first greeting was a
hada (a piece of white silk used as welcoming gift) and a full cup
of qingke wine fermented from highland barley. According to local
custom, we took a sip, dipped the third finger of our right hand
into the wine, then flicked it three times to symbolize respect for
heaven, earth and the person serving the wine - in this instance a
Yugur woman. It seems that many tourists, failing to appreciate the
drink's potency, gulp the whole cup and become drunk.

Happily we remain sober, and are invited to eight tents bordering a
meadow slope, there to be served a Yugur meal. The tents are simply
furnished with a carpet and low tables and stools. Once we are
seated, young women wearing fancy head adornments matching their
colourful dresses serve the steaming hot buttered tea and roast
mutton, true highlights of Yugur cuisine.

Because the tea is mixed with parched flour and milk as well as
butter, it tastes rich though surprisingly not greasy. The unboned
roast mutton comes in large portions and, as we are reminded, is
best eaten by hand - a greasier experience than the tea and
remindful of the bacchanalian heroes of the Chinese classic Water
Margins. But pulling the meat apart requires more skill than we had
realized.

The most delicious part of sheep - the tail and tendons - are by
Yugur custom usually given to guests, while the shank is for
children. The tender thigh is reserved for the elderly for obvious
reasons. A chef explains that the best roast mutton is neither too
lean nor fat. If the former, it will have an unpleasant smell, the
latter too greasy.

At meal's end a young man and five girls hurry into the tent. At a
gesture from the man, the girls start to sing, and when they're in
full flow he proposes individual toasts to each visitor in our
group. In return, guests have to finish half a cup of the qingke
wine. Although the host's warm hospitality is difficult to refuse,
we quickly realize the the wisdom of taking only sips, for girls
follow on his heels to propose their own toasts. The good news is
that the Yugurs will not force a guest to get drunk.

Yugur women are very particular about their headwear, which
represents their marital status. Married women's headwear is often
their precious dowry, inlaid as it is with pearls, diamonds and
agates. These form various patterns on a one-metre piece of cotton
flannel, which is circled turban-like around the head, with a short
stretch hanging down the back. Unmarried women wear far less
luxurious headwear, characterized by strings of beads adorning the
forehead.

The Yugurs are divided into two major groups, known as east and
west. The groups share the same language but, verbally, use
slightly different delivery. Women's headwear is the most
noticeable difference between the two groups. The easterners wear a
flat-topped design, westerners a "pointed" design.

Fortunate tourists - alas we were unlucky - might be invited to a
local wedding ceremony, unique to the Yugurs from time immemorial.
On the eve of the wedding, the bride's family hosts a dinner during
which a few married women place new headwear on the bride while
girls sing appropriate songs. When the bride and her attendant
leave their tent home the following morning, the bride's face is
veiled by a scarf. En route to the groom's tent, the bridal party
is greeted by the groom's friends and relatives, who provide wine
and introduce those who have made preparations for the wedding. By
custom, the bride's family is allowed to be critical of the
preparations, and even turn back if dissatisfied - an embarrassment
that rarely occurs.

As the bride approaches her new tent home, a "battle" breaks out,
which ostensibly shocks the guests. Seven or eight young men on
horseback from the bride's side of the union gallop around the tent
three times in a feigned effort to collapse it. The groom and his
family remain inside in an equally feigned effort to protect it.
When the battle is over, the groom's family takes the horses from
the riders.

When the bride enters the tent's flap, the groom shoots three
harmless "arrows" at her. If one strikes, it means the couple will
forever be happy together. Then it's on with the real ceremony,
conducted by a senior member of the groom's family. The young
couple, sitting on separate sides of a carpet, first worship Buddha
and then indicate their respect for each other.

Simultaneous with the start of music and singing, guests begin to
drink. Then uncles and aunts of the bride officially hand their
niece over to the groom's family. Celebrations continue until the
last guest leaves.

Yang Yuxia, a young local tour guide, says that Yugur girls are
these days allowed to marry Han men, a practice that had always
been forbidden. The change reflects increasing cultural and social
exchanges between the two cultures.

CHINA: Same Trip Yesterday 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

PROBABLY the most famous trip ever made from Xi'an to Lhasa was
more than 1,300 years ago by a princess on her way to marry the
King of Tubo (now Tibet). As early as the seventh century, Tubo was
establishing close ties with the Tang dynasty (618-907AD), the most
prosperous in feudal China. In 614, Tubo's King Songtsan Gambo made
an offer of marriage to the Tang through Emperor Taizong, and
Princess Wencheng was selected to be the bride.

It is not difficult to imagine the hardships of such a long
(2,700km) trip, which took the princess and her handmaidens and
escorts - headed by special envoy Li Daozong - more than two years
to reach Lhasa. There, the king had renovated the Potala Palace as
a welcome to his bride.

Now, with the opening of the Xi'an-Lhasa air route, travellers can
complete the same distance in little more than the time it takes to
watch a movie, about two and half hours. Meanwhile, those who are
curious about the details of the princess' legendary trip can
retrace her route, though in far greater comfort than the princess.

Now available is a tour called "Princess Wencheng Entering Tibet,"
developed by the Tibet Tourism Bureau. Tourists are taken by road
from Xi'an to Lhasa in about two weeks. En route they make four
major stops for sightseeing and special events.

CHINA: AVIATION: Jets to Roof of World: A new air route connecting Lhasa to
Xi'an is expected to harvest tourist gold 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From ZHANG DAN in Xi'an, P.22-23

TOURISTS and business travellers are taking advantage of a new,
third, air route to Tibet. Recently inaugurated by China
Southwestern Airlines, the sole civil service to offer round trips
to the roof of the world, the new service is between Xi'an -
capital of northwestern Shaanxi province - and Lhasa. Its average
seat occupancy rate since starting has been 57.3 per cent.

While this rate is still almost 10 per cent below the annual
average for China's civil carriers overall, a spokesman for China
Southwestern, which ranks fourth among the country's six major
airlines, says it is confident of filling more seats during the
next peak tourism season, summer 1997. "It's a new route, and may
still be unknown to many tour and ticketing agents," he says.

The maiden Xi'an-Lhasa flight was by a 198-seat Boeing 757 which
left Xianyang International Airport, 25km north of Xi'an, with 159
passengers. Just two-and-a-half hours later it touched down at
Gongar Airport, 100km outside Lhasa. The plane returned to Xi'an
the same day with 38 passengers.

As of September 11, more than 4,000 passengers had used the new
route, whose opening gives Tibet-bound travellers both a convenient
and interesting option to China Southwestern's two established
routes. Previously, people had to choose either Chengdu, capital of
southwestern Sichuan Province, or Chongqing - also in Sichuan - as
their starting point for Lhasa. Now, those beginning their journeys
in the north, Beijing for example, are finding it more convenient
to fly from Xi'an.

In marketing potential, the airline and China's tourist agencies
value the Xi'an-Lhasa route above the two Sichuan options. After
Beijing, Xi'an is high on most tourism itineraries because of the
famous terra-cotta warriors and horses of Emperor Qin Shihuang,
dating back 2,200 years.

This acknowledged wonder of the world helps make Xi'an one of the
country's most popular tourist destinations. In 1995, it received
nearly 400,000 international visitors, a number that is growing by
seven per cent every year. Meanwhile, at the other end of the
route, Lhasa, with its splendid Potala Palace, is an irresistible
attraction to countless tourists. Last year, Tibet received more
than 30,000 international tourists. It expects some five per cent
more this year.

Golden Route: China Southwestern press officer Yi Shizhong says the
airline is actively promoting the new flight to international and
domestic travel agencies and ticketing agents. "We believe it will
become a golden tourism route" - a view confirmed by the fact that
several Chinese airlines competed for the Xi'an-Lhasa licence. The
Civil Aviation Administration of China's decision to grant it to
China Southwestern was due to the airline's 40-year, accident-free
record in flying over the Tibetan Plateau, where blizzards and
jagged snow-clad peaks combine to test the nerve of pilots. "We
impose the strictest safety regulations to ensure that our flights
over the 'third pole on the planet' are safe," says Yi. "Four
decades of safe flying speaks for itself."

To date, the airline has made more than 24,000 flights to and from
Tibet, carrying a total of 2.8 million passengers and 10,000 tons
of freight.

Since 1994, China Southwestern has opened two other Tibet air
routes. One of them, Chengdu to Bangda in eastern Tibet, was made
possible by the construction of an airport encircled by 4,000m-high
mountains. The other is Chongqing-Lhasa. Prior to 1994, the airline
had only two routes: Chengdu-Lhasa and Lhasa-Kathmandu, the capital
of Nepal.

At present, the airline operates 44 Boeing 757 flights a week on
five routes over Tibet. "They are the newest and most reliable
planes in [our] fleet," says Yi. Some 300,000 passengers per year
fly China Southwestern to and from Tibet, a vast increase against
the services' early years.

Independent tourists: Yi believes the new Xi'an-Lhasa service will
further promote Tibet's economic and tourism growth. However, for
foreign independent tourists, visiting Tibet isn't simply a case of
buying and flying. A little planning and paperwork is necessary in
advance.

According to the Tibetan Autonomous Region's tourism bureau - "to
ensure foreign tourists' safety in Tibet" - international tourists
must travel in organized groups with special visas. Ticketing
agents can decline to sell air tickets to Tibet to individual
travellers without proper visas.

Tibet-bound visas: There are more than 40 travel agencies in Tibet
with government authority to receive tourists organized by their
business partners abroad. These agencies are responsible for
notifying Chinese embassies in foreign countries to issue visas
directly to Tibet-bound tourist groups.

But, for the convenience of independent tourists already in China
who wish to visit Tibet and may be unaware of the restriction, the
Tibetan Tourism Bureau has opened information offices in Chengdu,
Xi'an and Golmud, a railhead in northwestern Qinghai province where
overland travellers transfer to buses for the long onward ride to
Lhasa. There is also an office in Kathmandu. All these offices can
issue visas on the spot to foreign travel agents and foreign
independent tourists who have grouped together, after necessary
contacts have been made with local Tibetan agencies.

"In principle, Tibet doesn't allow nor receive individual
international tourists," says an official of the Tibetan Tourism
Bureau. "However, quite a number of them just travel overland from
ports on the China-Nepal border or Golmud." The local government
urges such tourists, who often display their adventurous spirit by
managing to travel across the formidable but challenging Tibetan
Plateau by bus - or even bicycle - to form groups upon their
arrival in Lhasa. To provide for their likely needs, a special
travel agency was set up in 1994. Called Lhasa Minjian (meaning
non-official) Travel Agency, the unit can make travel arrangements
for their further exploration of Tibet.

"A lot of individual international travellers come and go without
letting us know," comments a Tibetan tourism bureau official,
surmising that most are either unaware of the regulations or
worried that the procedure for obtaining a special visa is too
complicated

However, because Tibetans are eager to boost their tourism industry
and enrich the regional economy, they interpret the term "tourist
group" in the most-flexible way possible. "As a matter of fact, as
few as two people can make up a group," observes one official, "so
it's not a difficult thing.

CHINA: POLICY: Opening up In a New Era: China stays open to foreign funds,
with some policy adjustments 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From Chen Gengtao in Beijing, P.20-21

SEVENTEEN years into the country's opening to the outside world,
more and more Chinese can barely get through a day without using
something whose origin was in a foreign land. They may ride in a
Santana car to work, make long-distance calls with a Motorola
cellular phone, drink Beck's beer and wash their hair with Lux
shampoo.

These products have two things in common: they are all foreign
brands, and they are all made in China - mostly by joint ventures,
a few by wholly-owned foreign manufacturers. The car, for example,
is made by Germany's Volkswagen and its Chinese partner in
Shanghai.

The open policy advocated by retired leader Deng Xiaoping, and
vigorously implemented by the government over the years, has
benefited the Chinese as well as their country. More than 17
million people have found generally well-paid jobs in foreign-
funded enterprises, increasing numbers of them now boasting US
dollar accounts in the bank. Products they consume and use,
including table wines, toothbrushes, shoes, elevators, televisions
and cars, are of far better quality than ever before.

Thanks partly to the presence of foreign businesses which have
brought with them investment capital, technology and management
expertise, the Chinese economy has been able to grow at an annual
average rate of 12 per cent in the last five years. In 1995 alone,
foreign-funded enterprises paid close to 70 billion yuan (US$8.4
billion) in taxes, almost one-tenth of national tax revenues. Also
last year, with its total imports and exports amounting to $280
billion, China ranked 10th among the world's top trading nations.

Its dramatic emergence as a trading nation is due largely to its
open policy: foreign-funded enterprises accounted for about 40 per
cent of total imports and exports last year. In the first quarter
of this year, they rose to 45.9 per cent. And by May this year,
China's foreign exchange reserves reached $85 billion.

The open policy is one of two legs with which China is to achieve
modernization, according to Deng Xiaoping's design. The other leg
is economic reform, which has entered the phase of establishing a
market economy. As China begins to execute its 9th Five-Year Plan
this year, and with the 21st century only five years away, the
government has formulated a development programme covering the next
15 years - a blueprint adopted by the National People's Congress at
its general session last March.

Wider opening: Consistent with the open policy, the programme lays
down a number of principles for the future, the most general one
being to "open wider to the outside world," as Premier Li Peng told
the NPC. Says Lin Qihui, an official of the Special Economic Zones
Office under the central government: "This means primarily that
China will increase its openness in terms of geographical area and
business scope.

"Geographically, we will promote more foreign investment in cities
along major transport lines, and establish foreign investment zones
in provincial capitals. In [terms of] business scope, we will
gradually allow foreign businesses to play a greater role in fields
where they have been more or less restricted, such as mining,
banking, retailing and insurance."

Another principle is to "improve quality" in the actual
implementation of the open policy. This, according to Lin, means
broadening the economic efficiency and returns of all projects
involving foreign investment. Simply, China will become choosier in
approving new projects. "[Those] that use new and high technologies
will be encouraged, and those which pollute the environment
rejected," Lin says, adding that the administration and taxation of
foreign-funded enterprises will be reinforced.

Other major principles include the operation of foreign-funded
investments in accordance with market economics, with future growth
relying mainly on improved management and the use of advanced
technologies rather than on the launching of more projects.

Tariff slash: Preferential policies too will be substituted by
"increasing the vitality" of enterprises, thus giving them the
impetus for future growth. Indeed, from April 1 this year, foreign-
funded enterprises have no longer enjoyed tax exemptions on
imported manufacturing equipment. China has also slashed its tariff
rates from an average 35.9 per cent to 23 per cent.

Economists predict that the revocation of preferential treatment
will not affect foreign-funded operations that rely mainly on
technology. But it will create difficulties for those that have all
along relied mainly on tax breaks for profits. Revocation of these
breaks also means that Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises now
compete on an equal footing, the government says.

With political stability and a huge market, China is confident of
its continued attraction to foreign investors. The government
expects to receive a further $150 billion in foreign direct
investment in the next five years. That is big money indeed, though
a continued influx of such investment is seen as but a natural
widening of foreign interest in China over the past 17 years.

By the end of 1995, China had approved a total of 260,000 foreign-
funded enterprises, almost half of which have gone into operation.
Aggregate foreign investment reached $135 billion, making China the
world's second-largest recipient after the United States.

Coastal zones: Over the years, China has established five Special
Economic Zones along its coast, opened Pudong New Area - a
Singapore-size piece of land wedged between the East China Sea and
Shanghai proper - and established Suzhou Industrial Park, also near
Shanghai, with the Singapore Government as its partner. (Window,
August 9) All have become major centres of foreign investment.

Also playing host to foreign largesse are 32 state-level economic
and technological development zones, mainly in coastal cities. Many
of them have become economic powerhouses, too. In the economic and
technological development zone of Tianjin, a port city in north
China, for example, America's Motorola has been making pagers and
cellular phones in huge quantities and will soon make computer
phones and chips. Its investment in the zone has reached $1
billion.

Foreign-funded operations can now in fact be found almost
everywhere across the country, from Xinjiang in the far northwest
to Hainan Island in the South China Sea, Tibet to Inner Mongolia.
Thanks to paramount leader Deng's open policy, the PRC has become
increasingly economically integrated with the rest of the world.
Now, with the "open wider" policy adopted by the government, there
seems no limit to what the country can achieve in the future.

CHINESE MEDIA: What The Chinese Papers Say: Qian Misquoted: Distortion of
what Qian said during interview: From a commentary in the Ta Kung Pao,
October 18 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

IN REPLY to questions from staff reporters of the Asian Wall Street
Journal as to whether demonstrations to commemorate the June 4
incident be allowed in Hong Kong after 1997, Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said: "Hong Kong should not hold those
political activities which directly interfere in the affairs of the
mainland of China."

On the question of Hong Kong media being critical of Chinese
politics or leaders, Qian replied: "They can put forward criticism,
but not rumours or lies. Nor can they put forward personal attacks
on Chinese leaders."

As it is clear from the context of the report, Qian said no more
than to reiterate China's consistent position of implementing the
"one country, two systems" scenario and the principle of Hong Kong
people ruling Hong Kong.

But it should be remembered the vital importance of respect for the
rule of law and the counsel of "keeping well water and river water
separate" if the "one country, two systems" scenario is not to be
undermined.

While it is important that the mainland should not interfere in the
capitalist system and way of life in Hong Kong, nor should Hong
Kong interfere in the mainland's socialist system. Respect for each
other provides the space for each to conduct their affairs in their
own way.

Enshrined in the Basic Law, the letter and spirit of these
principles, are accepted by the vast majority of Hong Kong people.

In reiterating these principle, Qian had no intention of suggesting
that the China is tightening its control of Hong Kong. There is no
cause to stir up a storm in a teacup from what Qian told the staff
reporters of the AWSJ.

The incident of Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe and the media fervour
it created in Hong Kong is blatantly a case of interfering in
China's internal affairs. Moreover it also violated the territory's
immigration laws.

CHINESE MEDIA: What The Chinese Papers Say: Time to Move: It is time to
seek return of the Diaoyus: From an editorial in the Sing Tao Daily News,
October 16 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By GERALD CHEN, P.19

SO FAR the moderate stance maintained by Beijing with regard to the
Diaoyu issland issue has caused considerable misunderstanding among
Chinese within China as well as abroad. Under these circumstances,
we were heartened by news conveyed recently by Hong Kong members of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from top
Chinese leaders that Beijing is prepared "to lose a thousand ounces
of gold, rather than give in an inch to territory" - quoting a
Chinese proverb. This reassuring message can be understood to mean
that all necessary strategic precautions have been put in place by
China.

It was disclosed that Chia did not refrain from from demanding the
immediate return of the Diaoyus for economic reasons. More
important, it was because of the wrongful involvement of the US in
the Diaoyus issue that a settlement must wait until "an appropriate
time," although it is still unknown when that appropriate time
would be.

In his written reply to the Japanese media last week, Chinese Vice-
Premier (and foreign minister) Qian Qichen stated that in both
agreements signed between China and Japan in l972 and 1978 it was
agreed that the Diaoyu issued should be shelved and its settlement
should be left to posterity. This commitment was the greatest
hindrance to efforts seeking the return of the Diaoyus.

But now that Japan has categorically denied that there ever was
such an understanding, it stands to reason that China no longer
need to feel bound by any commitment and would be in a position to
seek the return of these islands. Indeed, it might be taken as a
sign of weakness to be taken advantage of by Japan if China were to
continue with its hitherto mild stance on the issue.

It is true that China must tread carefully because of the US
involvement. However, as one can gather from the US spokesman's
statements on the subject, Washington does not wish to get further
involved in this issue, most probably because it has realized its
mistake in placing the Diaoyus under the administration of Okinawa
in 1971.

The present international climate makes it mandatory for
territorial disputes to be resolved without the use of armed force.
In the case of the Diaoyus, resorting to the use of force can only
give Japan additional excuse to expand its military build-up, which
would not be in interest of regional stability.

Many are in China's favour in its dispute with Japan over the
Diaoyus if the issue is sorted out without the use of force.
Historians know that the Diaoyus used to be under the jurisdiction
of Taiwan. The island group never had anything to do with Okinawa
at all. This is not only because the Diaoyus were formally
designated as a part of Taiwan in 1862; evidence of this can also
be found in Okinawan and Japanese  history books.

Japan most probably first decided to seize the Diaoyus in 1894,
although it was the Shimonoseki Treaty signed at the end of Sino-
Japanese War of 1895 which ended in China's humiliating defeat that
put the Diaoyus under the administration of Okinawa. Taiwan was
also annexed by Japan as a result of the Shimonoseki Treaty.

When the US took over Okinawa after World War II, the Diaoyus were
also considered within the administration of Okinawa. Okinawa and
the Diaoyus were "handed back" to Japan by virtue of an US-Japanese
agreement signed in 1971.

The point is, Japan's claim to the Diaoyus was already nullified
because the unequally Shimonoseki Treaty had been abolished (by the
Cairo Agreement of 1943 and the Potsdam Agreement of 1945). There
is no legal basis whatsoever to Japan's sovereign claim to the
Diaoyu islands.

Although, properly speaking, administration of the Diaoyus should
still belong to Taiwan, it stands to reason that any diplomatic
effort seeking the return of these islands can only be conducted by
China with Japan.

No doubt Japan is not about to give up it claim to the Diaoyus
easily.

But all reason is on China's side, in the light of international
laws and otherwise, even if the issue goes before international
tribunal.

COMMENTARY: BACKSTREET JAPAN: Child Abuse 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By R.J. GUTHRIE, P.18

UNSOLICITED solicitations in the daily post for everything from
home-delivered masseuses to bargain leases on BMWs is another
unwelcome sign of Japan's wealth. Many make interesting reading.
Some are downright scary, like a recent deluxe mailing telling me
about a pre-kindergarten for one-year-olds. Since our youngest is
in his third year at university I almost threw it away. But then I
noticed the glossy colour pictures showing something that looked
more like an upscale athletic club than a creche. So I read its
pitch.

It seems this particular school is telling Japanese mothers that
it's never too young to get on the education treadmill; that their
children should start learning something now and begin mastering
those particular skills eventually needed to get them accepted by
Tokyo or Waseda universities. Some may call this progress. I tend
to see it as child abuse, and another example of a society blessed
with more money than sense.

Preschool education has been a big business in Japan for quite some
time and has become a lucrative business for entrepreneurs more
concerned with bottom lines than children. At last count, there
were 8,600 privately run kindergartens in Japan with 77,800
teachers and an enrolment of 1.47 million.. This is more than four
times the number of public-run facilities.

Some of the "top rated" kindergartens have unofficial ties with
universities in that X kindergarten is a stepping stone to X
elementary school, then X middle school, and finally X high school
leading to entrance in X university 15 years later. These
kindergartens can cost up to US$1,300 to $2,000 per month,
including "unofficial" and supplemental fees, and entrance is as
competitive as it is at Oxford or Harvard.

Education mamas: Sound ridiculous? Well, it doesn't to Japan's
millions of kyoikyu (education) mamas, the hybrid Japanese noun
used to describe and decry those mothers whose sole purpose in life
is to ensure their children pass the entrance examinations at a top
university. These are the mothers that send their six-year-old to
juku or privately run cram schools for around three hours a day
after school, six and sometimes seven days a week.

The accent is not on personal enlargement or even acquiring
knowledge. Rather it is on rote mastery of the material of and ways
needed to pass entrance examinations to the more desirable schools
that requires living for 15 years in the "examination hell'" as the
Japanese themselves call this process. This disquieting phenomenon
has now, it seems, filtered down to the toddler level.

Kiysohi Takara, a clinical psychologist, recently published a book
with the rather ponderous title Warning! Dangerous Preschool
Education - A Clinical Report condemning the sort of services being
provided by the kindergarten that sent me its glossy catalogue. Dr
Takara says that while education at a young age is not the only
cause of children's problems, it does cause them to lose any spirit
of independence. It puts heavy pressure on them and drives them on
to a sort of mental treadmill. Parents are forcing their young
children to become "smart" and the children feel an immense
pressure to do what they are being told - to live up to "A-grade"
expectations at their kindergartens, for example. This, in turn,
places a terrible burden on the parent-child relationship. As
preschool education drives children to go faster and higher than
others, they lose self-confidence in the process and feel more
restless. This accumulates a tremendous amount of stress and more
and more children are even "losing the ability to cry as an SOS
signal."

Other, equally respected experts have been saying for years that
children who are forced to use their brains too much in the early
stages of development lack emotional stability. There are dozens of
published case studies on three-year-olds suffering from stress.
This is disturbing, even in a country where dying of overwork is
officially classified as an "occupational hazard."

Even more worrying is that a vast number of parents see nothing
basically wrong with the present accent on education, and believe
that schooling is the means to all desirable ends. As Japan's
wealth has multiplied and the extended family declined, many
parents have abrogated their responsibilities for child-rearing to
the schools. Whatever the reason, the young people today are
worrying their elders like never before. The first, spoiled progeny
of Japan's economic boom and the sons and daughters of the
prototype "education mamas" are now in their early twenties. They
see themselves as Japan's first "lost generation."

Several immensely popular television shows make big advertising
dollars by making fun of them. One regularly spotlights fashionable
young women who take an almost perverse pride in not being able to
boil an egg or fry rice. While presented as comedy, such shows are
giving a once-satisfied older generation another reason to worry
about where they have gone wrong.

Critics more serious than those who appear on television - which in
Japan includes your average cabdriver, bottle washer, and noodle
cook - see the rise of the Aum Shinrikyo subway-gassers and dozens
of less homicidal yet equally strange cults as natural outgrowths
of fallen educational and parental values.

Today's younger people feel a spirit-sucking emotional and
philosophical vacuum in modern Japan. Most of my son's more
intelligent friends have no intention of becoming part of the
economic juggernaut that their elders worked so hard to build. I
like to think this is a hopeful sign, and that tomorrow's Japan
will be a lot more human, a little more green, and a lot less self-
centred. I do know for certain that none of them will ever dream of
sending their one-year-olds to a fast-track kindergarten.

COMMENTARY: WINDOW FORUM: Arrogance of a Ruler 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.16

SZE CHEUNG PANG: Member of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference and one of the earliest investors in China.
Sze is an authority on economic development in China and Hong Kong
and has published many articles on the subject.

SOON after Governor Chris Patten came to Hong Kong, he pushed for
political reform and set in motion a Sino-British argument. This
was condemned by former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser,
writing in an Australian newspaper, who said that Patten was trying
to teach China how to manage its own country, and pointing out
Patten's ulterior and destructive intention.

Patten immediately rebutted, explaining that he only wished to
stage a "fair election," and not teach China how to administer. But
Patten completely forgets this statement and continues to dictate
to China how it should manage the Hong Kong Special Administrative
region. The degree of arrogance and ignorance is simply beyond
forbearance.

Patten uses the term "successor" throughout his policy address for
the first chief executive of the SAR. This is also a demonstration
of utter stupidity. The resumption of sovereignty of China over
Hong Kong means an absolute end of British colonial rule, and a
start of a new era for Hong Kong.

There is nothing in the handover that suggests a political nature
of continuance or succession between the governor and the SAR chief
executive. Handover of sovereignty is to be carried out between
Britain and China, and the first chief executive will receive his
authority from China, and not from the governor.

Patten's statement violates the rules governing the handing over of
Hong Kong's authority as stipulated in the Sino-British Joint
Declaration. He is continuing to stir up public opinion on
"returning rule to Hong Kong people."

Patten's rule of Hong Kong is not up to standard. He is therefore
not qualified to talk about "Hong Kong's success story" or "the
principles of governing Hong Kong."

Basic Law guide: Furthermore, he deliberates on the necessity of
China signing two international covenants. This is absurd. In his
policy address, he listed out 10 key elements for future SAR plans
and 16 benchmarks for judging the future Hong Kong. The chief
executive has the Basic Law as guiding principles of
administration; the Basic Law is also the best benchmark for
appraisal. The 10 elements and the 16 benchmarks are already
embodied in the Basic Law.

In the section on the 16 benchmarks, Patten let himself go and in
many places talks about "pressure by Peking; "objectives dictated
by Peking" and makes other high-sounding but meaningless points. He
speaks as if the decisive factor for Hong Kong's future success
lies in whether it can act against Beijing. His ulterior motive is
obvious, and is particularly strong at this moment when his leaving
is imminent.

Patten refers to Hong Kong's autonomy several times in the policy
address. He says that before Britain leaves Hong Kong, it, besides
trying its best to retain a certain value, will also strive to make
sure that Hong Kong will enjoy autonomy in social and economic
affairs as at present.

He also insists, "my anxiety is this: not that this community's
autonomy would be usurped by Peking, but that it could be given
away bit by bit by some people in Hong Kong," and calls on Hong
Kong people to "defend and assert" for autonomy. An English
governor, endowed with absolute power to fulfil colonial rule in
Hong Kong, deliberates on autonomy!

Slave-master: This is just like a slave-master talking about
autonomy to his slaves, and is the most ludicrous farce under
heaven. It is simply deceptive to say that Hong Kong has autonomy.
Hong Kong people don't even have the right to elect their governor,
and final judicial judgement lies with Britain; where does autonomy
comes in?

Hong Kong will have autonomy only after its return to China. At
present there does not exist a problem as to who has ruined Hong
Kong's autonomy. Hong Kong's autonomy is granted by China, so there
would not be a problem of its being "usurped by Peking." Patten
bases these opinions on visits by some Hong Kong people to Beijing,
which he calls "surreptitious appeal" or "closed-door lobbying,"
and that "it draws Chinese officials into matters which should fall
squarely within the autonomy of Hong Kong."

This is simply absurd. It is in Hong Kong people's interest to
stand by the Chinese Government to counteract the damage and
interruption caused by Patten on Hong Kong's smooth transition.
This is fair and embodies Hong Kong people's responsibility as
masters of the place. We who have been under colonial rule will no
longer be submissive subjects at Britain's beck and call. In the
eyes of Patten, this is the worst heresy. This clearly reveals his
true picture as a guardian of colonialism.

That an ignorant and arrogant British politician has a chance to
fan flames of disorder at the final stage of Hong Kong's transition
is in itself a misfortune brought about by history.

What is fortunate is that Hong Kong people are more and more aware
of the real colours of Patten, and have completely forsaken him.

Lu Xun, a great Chinese author, once said: "Some people wish to be
immortal, but rot more quickly than the earth." Patten is exactly
such a figure.

HONGKONG: HEALTH: Patten Dogged by UK Rabies Control Law: Pet pooches face
long confinement 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

From CHRIS JASPER in London, P.15

CHRIS Patten has once again been accused of exploiting his position
as governor of Hong Kong in order to intervene in British politics
- this time on behalf of his pet dogs Whisky and Soda.

In November last year Patten backed UK tax cuts and the
Conservative Party's lurch to the right in a move seemingly in
contradiction of his required neutrality as a civil servant. The
comments led to calls for his resignation.

And last week the governor threw himself into UK politics for a
second time when he gave a high-profile interview in which he
called for the scrapping of quarantine laws aimed at keeping the
killer disease rabies out of Britain.

Patten had made remarks critical of quarantine in the past - and in
May he was accused of making a personal plea to former cabinet
colleagues for a change in the law, the details of which Window can
now confirm.

The governor's most recent outburst followed the revelation that
British agriculture minister Douglas Hogg had proposed a review of
the world's toughest rabies controls, in force since 1901.

Passports: Details of the proposed move to a "passports-for-pets"
scheme - featuring strict vaccination and blood testing and animal
identification by means of implanted microchips - were circulated
to cabinet ministers last month. And when the controversial plan
was later leaked to the press, Patten popped up to endorse it.

"Like thousands of diplomats, service and business families around
the world, I feel the present British quarantine rules are
preposterous," he told The Times in an interview conducted on
October 13. "And yes, I have told the prime minister what I think."

Patten added: "There is just no scientific basis for them and they
risk cruelty to animals. But with new safeguards we can get rid of
the rules without undermining public health."

Unfortunately for the governor and his two Norfolk terriers, even
the reformers envisage abandoning quarantine only for European
Union countries and rabies-free islands such as Cyprus and Malta.
And though Hong Kong is notionally rabies free, it is no island.

Desperate to win his pampered pooches a reprieve from the
compulsory six-months behind bars - cost around 2,000 (HK$24,000)
per dog - Patten was moved to call for the extension of the scheme
world-wide.

"I think it would be very curious if they applied it just to the EU
and not generally," he said. "Provided the animals carry a
microchip, have been inoculated, have a certificate, and are tested
on arrival in Britain, it should not make too much difference which
country they come from."

In its front-page article, The Times also indicated that Patten
hoped Britain would reach cross-party consensus on the issue before
his dogs were forced into kennels next summer, while Government
House sought to make light of his remarks. "The governor has
basically said the same thing over and over again," said a
spokesman. "And though he's definitely going to bring Whisky and
Soda back to UK, he understands that any change in the law will be
too late for him."

Perhaps - but a personal approach made by Patten earlier this year
and reported in The Spectator on May 25 suggests that he will not
give up that easily. Discussing the quarantine debate, the magazine
remarked: "The word in Westminster is that Patten has been making
noises on the subject to Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine."

Window can now reveal that those "noises" were made when the
governor was visiting Britain and had a private chat with
Heseltine, during which he suggested that diplomats and others
should be partly exempt from the quarantine law.

Says a source: "What Patten wanted was some sort of fast-track
through quarantine of the type being demanded by army officers
serving in Cyprus. They seem to think they are more deserving than
- let us say - the 70,000 Britons living in Spain."

Significantly, new government pointers this week suggest that a
universal fast-track quarantine of just two months is under
consideration, and that Patten may get his way - although whether
any changes could be made before next June is debatable. Either
way, the governor's stance on the issue has already made him new
enemies in Britain, with Guy Tamplin, chairman of the Quarantine
Kennel Owners Association, accusing him of a "gross misuse of his
public position."

Says Tamplin: "He's abusing his job to campaign in his own
interests. And he's a government appointee, so it's not even as if
he can claim to be expressing the views of constituents. Let's hope
he didn't employ public funds or time in pursuing this personal
crusade."

"One of the animals once went missing for four days," he recalls.
"And the other was locked up for biting someone. On top of that
there is virulent hook worm in Hong Kong, so I don't think their
case is very strong." Tamplin also calls into question the
effectiveness of anti-rabies vaccines, claiming that in many cases
they fail to produce enough antibodies. Yet his objections will
count for little if the Ministry of Agriculture has made up its
mind.

But though new legislation may be in the pipeline, Patten must
place Whisky and Soda in kennels in January to be sure of a July
reunion. And as the pair will be required for myriad photo
opportunities when he resumes his political career, their early
departure still seems likely.

HONGKONG: WELFARE: Home-alone Law Plea: Handover hampers Legco
deliberations 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By JUANITO CONCEPCION, P.14

WHEN home-alone Chan Chi-ho, aged five, almost burned to death a
week ago in a padlocked public housing flat in Kwai Chung, the
community was understandably outraged - rightly feeling that
locking up small children and leaving them unattended, even for a
short period, is unforgivable because it is a blatantly
irresponsible invitation to tragedy.

Despite the appalling burns to 60 per cent of the child's body and
the collective outrage it generated, chances are that a similar or
even more serious accident will occur in coming months, warn child
welfare activists. For Chan was far from the first child to be left
in such a situation, witness the prosecutions and resultant wide
publicity of recent years, but some parents never learn.

Activists' fears stem from three major factors: the ineptitude of
relevant government departments, glaring loopholes in different
pieces of legislation on child welfare and protection, and the
irresponsibility of parents themselves.

Under current laws, a parent or guardian who leaves a child
unattended is not liable to any penalty, even if the victim dies or
is injured in an accident - serious or otherwise.

Grey area: Says Cynthia Luk, division supervisor at St James
Settlement: "It's [the practice of leaving children unattended] a
grey area, and it's not prosecutable right now because it doesn't
fall under any ordinance. Unless it's defined clearly in the law as
a form of child abuse, I don't think there will be a strong and
effective deterrent against this malpractice." She says St James
has yet to firm up its position on this issue.

In the past, the group has always advocated education rather than
prosecution as a more effective tool in addressing problematic
issues. The volunteer agency believes that prosecuting erring
parents can be counter-productive as it can generate their
hostility and anger, and make reunion with their children more
difficult.

Luk concedes, however, that while some parents change through
education, others do not respond despite reminders and warnings of
the consequences of leaving their children unattended. "There are
hindrances in Chinese society and culture in resolving problems
involving parents and their children," she says. "Chinese people
are moderate, and very reluctant to resort to legal action.

"If legislation is passed, the consequences of penalties that would
be imposed on adults, or the parents, would have to be carefully
considered as they may adversely affect the welfare and interests
of their children."

The community's ambivalence over this issue was clearly
demonstrated when the government sponsored a public consultation
more than a year ago on how home-alone children could best be
protected. Luk recalls that the consultation exercise failed to
produce a consensus on a way forward.

Against-Child-Abuse director Priscilla Lui argues that the act of
leaving children unattended should fall under neglect - one of the
four classifications of child abuse currently punishable under the
law. The others embrace the physical, psychological and sexual.

However, the Home Affairs Branch is reluctant to define home-alone
situations as a form of child abuse, Lui asserts. HAB is
responsible for overseeing the implementation of the package of
legislation, passed in July last year on child care and protection.

She says: "Nobody wants to penalize anybody, especially if a home-
alone child dies. Nobody wants to impose a further burden on the
party who is responsible for a tragedy. What we're saying is that
defining home-alone situations doesn't mean jailing anybody. It's
simply putting a problem in focus which can be likened to a doctor
making a diagnosis that helps him determine the right remedy to a
medical problem."

She stresses the importance of classifying home-alone cases as a
form of child abuse because it will set a baseline in the community
on how young children should properly be taken care of. "Our real
intention is to see better and more effective protection for
children, not erring parents and child minders being placed behind
bars."

ACA has recommended an increase in the options for punishing erring
parents and guardians of home-alone children. These include advice
or reprimand; payment of fines; rendering community service; and
jail.

Luk complains that Hong Kong, unlike the US, Canada and other
Western countries, does not have comprehensive legislation for
protecting and promoting the rights of children, as well as
vigorously tackling the problem of child abuse.

As Legco's agenda is full for its final session before next year's
handover, the prospects of it adopting new legislation that
addresses the home-alone problem does not look promising, says Luk.

ACA's Lui concurs, even as she laments the seemingly high level of
tolerance among policymakers and the community over tragic the
tragic incidence of children being badly injured while locked up at
home and left unattended by their parents or guardians.

At its 13th conference in Geneva early this month, the United
Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child attacked Hong Kong's
poor record in protecting and promoting the rights of children. The
UK, a signatory to the (separate) UN Convention on the Rights of
the Child, filed a report on behalf of Hong Kong.

Legco also slammed the government's shortcomings in a report it
tabled at the Geneva conference which criticized the government's
statistics on child abuse and neglect as incomplete and
uncoordinated. It is thus doubtful if the figures, says the report,
"present a true picture of the problem."

The Legco report also quoted the coroner's 1994 statistics which
showed there were 113 deaths between 1989 and 1994 involving
unattended children under the age of nine.

drive boredom out of classroom 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By ANNA YUE, P.12-13

A BLACKBOARD revolution is set to sweep over the curriculum for
local secondary school students - a wide-ranging Education
Department initiative to make their studies more fun, thus more
effective. As a result, bored-with-school youngsters could find
themselves chalking up far better grades than ever before.

The fun-factor innovation was disclosed by Brenda Lo, secretary of
a department steering committee set up in mid-1993 to "coordinate
the design and implementation of appropriate curricula and related
activities to promote pleasurable and effective learning" - a
concept whose various components are geared towards the common goal
of making learning a happier experience.

A joint survey by the Education Department and the University of
Hong Kong's curriculum studies department of 610 students from all
types of school shows that only 30 per cent of secondary pupils
find studying enjoyable. Sixty per cent describe it as "OK," while
the remainder confess to being unhappy about studying anyway.

The majority of respondents agree that a school's study environment
and the relationship between friends, family members and teachers
can greatly affect their study mood. The most important factors
affecting their motivation to study were the teaching method and
atmosphere of the school.

Experiences: Conducted in 1994, the survey was in two parts. In the
first, students were asked to list and rank their pleasant and
unpleasant experiences, and factors leading to them. Questionnaires
for the second part were set according to the results of the first.
The final report of the survey, still under review, will be
produced late next month. Its release will coincide with a November
29 seminar for secondary school principals and teachers who will
discuss the findings and share experiences on the promotion of
pleasurable and effective learning.

Lo emphasizes that the focus of the survey was both how much
students enjoy studying, and how effectively they learn - both
aspects being of equal importance. She says there is a chance the
Education Department will change the design of the curriculum to
reinforce students' learning motive, and make studying fun. "This
is exactly the goal of the survey," she says. "Because it found
that the relationship with friends and teachers can influence
students' interest in learning, we would bear these factors in mind
when redesigning the curriculum to make learning fun and effective
for them."

Betty Wong, who has taught Form 1-4 at Chinese Holiness College for
three years, believes many students do not find studying
pleasurable because of off-school attractions such as karaoke and
video games. "Another reason is related to the problems that
teachers face. The curriculum is often boring and difficult, and
not many teachers are able to make it lively for students," she
says. "Teachers have a very heavy workload; apart from teaching,
there is a huge amount of administrative work, so there is no time
left to prepare interesting, motivating material for students."

Wong also points to parent-child relationships as a cause of
students' lack of motivation. Many of her own students have no
siblings. "They are neglected by parents, and usually brought up by
grandparents. They are spoiled and lack discipline. During class,
some day-dream and others talk or sleep." She feels that such
children lack self-confidence, and are deserving of the concern and
encouragement of teachers.

She recalls a successful case with a student who had a poor
academic record. After he was charged with organizing some extra-
curricular activities, his self-esteem greatly improved -
triggering pleasure in his studies and better academic results.

Ankey Wun, a teacher for six years and currently involved in
teacher-training for target-oriented curricula, agrees there are
many reasons for students' inability to learn happily and
effectively. For example, the Education Department's limited
resources restrict secondary students with poor academic records
from repeating a grade more than twice. "Some students need to
repeat more than this," he argues, "but as the system does not
allow it, they cannot catch up in an upper form. This adversely
affects their enjoyment of study."

Wun also points to the transitory teenage years, when boys and
girls are developing independence. "But the Hong Kong educational
system does not encourage independent thinking," he says. "This
limits their strengths and preferences, such as creativity. As they
are not allowed to develop independence in school, it leads to
dissatisfaction." He notes that as many teachers do not hold
education certificates, they may not know the correct way to teach
effectively.

Wun's solution: a more flexible curriculum, which is part of his
role in his current post in aiming to improve the level of
happiness and effectiveness in learning. Under target-oriented
curricula - at present restricted to primary students - youngsters
are taught through activities such as games and competitions, using
examples from daily life to better explain concepts and ideas.

Ultimately, it is believed, students' interests are aroused and
their performance improved. Wun says the Education Department plans
to introduce this method to secondary schools in 2001. Meanwhile,
he hopes more clerks can be employed to relieve teachers'
administrative burdens.

Student view: Window spoke with various secondary students
including, during his mid-morning break, Daniel Kwan, who is in F2
at Kowloon Wah Yan College. Kwan says he is happy with school life,
and particularly delighted with the new-found freedom he finds at
secondary level. "In primary school there were so many restrictions
and lots of regimentation, like forming proper lines to go into
assembly" he recalls. "But now that I'm here, I'm free. I don't
have to queue any more, which I always hated."

He also enjoys classes because "teachers are very humorous and
often tell jokes, which make us laugh. I enjoy studying [here]
since the environment is very good. The teachers are concerned
about us, and talk to us individually to see if we are coping with
our studies. And there is a quiet library when we want to study,
and a basketball court, soccer pitch and swimming pool when we want
to play with our classmates, who are also our friends." Kwan admits
his parents pressure him about his studies, but says his
relationship with them is good.

In contrast to Kwan, Wong Wing Ho and Dan Ny Luk - F1 students at
Chong Gene Hang College - view their study environment merely as
"OK" because they are unhappy with some schoolmates' behaviour.
"When we queue for lunch at the canteen, some of them always jump
ahead of us," complains Wong. Adds Dan: "Some often chat with each
other during class, and this interrupts our learning process
because the teachers have to stop teaching to scold them."

Monica Wan, an F7 science student at St Gloria Girls' School, also
classifies learning as "OK," claiming the tight syllabus of the
HKCEE and A-levels "suffocate" her. "Both public exams require me
to digest a large volume of information within a very short time,"
she says. "Unfortunately, some teachers do not have the patience to
teach. They just prepare a whole bunch of written material and ask
us to read it by ourselves. It's really hard to learn without their
guidance. But as an upper form student, I think I should learn to
study independently."

Noting that most of her science teachers are male, she wonders if
they know how to express concern toward students. This said, she is
happy with her relationships with her family and classmates.

F3 students Joey Lau and Fiona Leung of True Light Girls' College
say their school life is "below average" since they think their
school too small and because there are many dictation sessions,
mini-exams and other tests every week.

Agreeing that a school's teaching methods affect their study
motivation, they say: "Some teachers give daily life examples,
personal experiences and even tell stories to explain ideas. This
makes studying fun. But some teachers just read straight from
books."

HONGKONG: WELFARE: Elderly Not Fed Up With Daily Allowance: Life at the
bottom on SWD allocation 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By BETSY MAY VELOO, P.10-11

IT IS as far a cry from a banquet as you can get when 75-year-olds
Ng Hing-sing and friend Pang Chak-kui seat themselves at a small
table in the former's tiny Shek Kip Mei flat and dig into their
evening meal - rice with hints of scrambled egg and tomatoes, and a
shared four-cm sliver of salted fish left over from some days
before.

No soup, gentlemen? "It would cost $40 to $50 if we made soup,"
says Ng. "We will wait until there are more friends with us, then I
can cook soup" - shorthand for the poverty-line reality that making
a pan of soup is a finely balanced economic proposition as much as
a nutritional need. But that's how you think when the daily food
allowance doled out to you by the Social Welfare Department is
calculated at $23 per day - or $7.60 a meal.

The diners had bought their eggs for a dollar apiece, though they
could have saved a whole 20 cents on each had they scrabbled around
stalls in other districts. But that would have entailed transport
costs.

Inferior stuff: The slightly discoloured tomatoes are part of a
pack of five bought by Ng for $4. Had the men wanted pork,
unavailable in the tiny amounts suitable to their budget, it would
have cost $8-10. Fish too is expensive at their level of existence,
so for one meal it would have meant something low grade at around
$10.

Salted fish, the friends note, can cost $60-70 so it is eked out in
tiny amounts over a few weeks. Fresh vegetables are a rarity on
this particular table. But that doesn't stop them from sometimes
splashing out $2 or $3 for some stale greens.

Ng can cook - which makes him luckier than most of the single
elderly. He lives in public housing and has a refrigerator which
SKM Kei Oi Social Service Centre, run by volunteers, helped him
acquire. Thus he is able to economize slightly by buying "that
little bit more" and keeping it relatively fresh.

Friend Pang's world is a bedspace cubicle, where cooking is banned.
Unless invited for tea or a larger meal by Ng, he has to shop for
his own food. A lunch box of plain white rice with a string of
green vegetable - and perhaps two pieces of meat - sets him back
$18-20. A plain soup noodle with two wonton dumplings costs about
the same.

Thus he buys $2 buns for breakfast, sometimes plain congee for $4.
If he wants fried flour sticks (yau char kui) to go with his
congee, it costs an additional $4. Pang says in order to stretch
his finances he has only two meals a day.

What about fruits? Ng and Pang reply with one voice: "Too
expensive." But they say they try to buy a few grapes or oranges
"once in a while." What then about yum cha, for which Hong Kong is
famed? "I can't remember when I last had it," says Pang, without
rancour. "It's been so long."

So can elderly people reasonably be expected to survive on $23-
worth of food a day (and disregarding that Hong Kong is one of the
richest but most expensive cities in the world)? A government
report on the Review of the Comprehensive Social Security
Assistance Scheme says they can. (The scheme was set up to help
those in financial need.)

According to Dr M. F. Leong, president of the Association of
Gerontology, people must - in order to maintain a healthy body -
have at least two main meals a day, comprising cereals or rice,
bread, meat or meat-related products, vegetables and fruits.

The government report's arithmetic is that a single elderly person
can survive on $688-worth of food a month - hence the average $23 a
day, or $7.60 a meal.

Survival: Professor Stewart MacPherson of City University agrees
with the report's findings, but only to a point. "An elderly person
can survive on $23-worth of meals per day," he says. "That is clear
from the many thousands who do so every day in Hong Kong. But can
they live? My calculation of the 'minimum acceptable' level of food
gives a figure of $34 per day for an elderly person at today's
prices. This is still not generous, and is a minimum standard."

He explains: "The major difference between SWD calculations and
mine is that they exclude all food except that required for
survival. I try to take some account of real life to allow some
dignity in social life for old people."

Suvan Law of the voluntary social service centre is "appalled" at
the SWD allocation. "I don't know what [the government] was
thinking. Imagine having only $7.60 to spend on a meal. This may be
one of the reasons why old people have no money to buy healthy
foods." She has on earlier occasions accused the government of
ignorance in its calculation of people's basic needs. "Government
officers really don't know how the elderly live, what they eat or
how they try to save by buying low-quality food," she charges.

In scrimping, many of the elderly forego social events such as
picnics or trips to other districts. "That is why so many of them
are found in parks - their only social life," says Law.

Dr S. Y. Au, president of the Hong Kong Geriatric Society, relates
how his elderly patients save money. "I received some tips from
them, like don't boil water," he says. "Just drink tap water to
save energy. When cooking, prepare enough for two meals so that,
again, fuel is saved. Afterwards, don't put leftover food in the
fridge as more energy is required to warm it up."

While the inventiveness of the elderly in cutting financial corners
is admirable, it should not detract from the harsh fact that a
proper diet is as important to them as a babe in arms. As Au says:
"These people are more prone to disease, and so have to pay
particular attention to their diet."

But, given the amounts they are presently expected to manage on,
can they do so, ask social workers? The CSSA payment for a single
elderly person was increased last April to $1,935 per month from
$1,810 - a jump of seven per cent, said by the government to be
pegged to inflation.

"But things today are so much more expensive, especially for the
elderly," argues Law. In addition to higher quality food, they by
far prefer Chinese herbal medicines which can cost anywhere between
$100-150. And while public hospital services are virtually free for
CSSA recipients, the queues are long.

Au says that, sometimes, the problems of the elderly might not so
much be lack of money as lack of knowledge about the availability
of resources. "The problem is that many may not know what these
resources are, and how to access them. We therefore need to
increase publicity," he suggests.

There is another side to receiving welfare, he says. Many of the
elderly can be quite proud when it comes to seeking financial aid
from the government. One example is a 76-year-old woman who buys a
single fish for $5, making it last for two days. She consistently
refuses help, says Au. "She says she has no financial problems, and
says she is used to eating half a fish a day - which she regards as
a good habit." Even an offer of help over a new set of dentures
(minimum cost $800) was refused. "She said she had enough money to
buy her own," says Dr Au.

Law agrees that many of the elderly refuse to live on what they
perceive as charity. Sometime, she admits, social workers have to
convince them that it is their right to ask for financial help from
the government. "It's often a tug-of-war between charity and their
rights. We have to convince them that it is their right to have a
better life after all their years of contributing to society- their
right to live with quality and dignity."

Current SWD payments being what they are, she adds, "dignity"
appears to be a foreign word.

Perhaps, she says, the government should heed MacPherson when he
says that the so-called Basic Needs Approach adopted by the SWD is
"inappropriate in a wealthy modern society such as Hong Kong," and
that it should re-think just how much an elderly person can live on
with dignity.

Says MacPherson: "We should be using standards and measures which
reflect the society we live in. A society may be judged by the way
it treats its old people."

HONGKONG: POLITICS: Li Enters CE Race: Heavyweight contenders ready for
battle 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By BRIAN MACLEOD, P.8

WITH the announcement on Wednesday by retired Appeal Court judge
Simon Li Fook-sean - a 10-year behind-the-scenes veteran of key
transition events and positions - that he has officially joined the
race for the chief executive post, and a similar confirmation by
shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa last weekend, the contest has begun
to take on some really interesting dimensions. In joining Chief
Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang and businessman Peter K.C. Woo, it can be
said that there are now true heavyweights in the ring, giving the
lie to those who proclaim that the selection process would amount
to little more than Beijing bestowing its blessing on the pre-
ordained candidate of its choice.

Although Li has been the last of the four to declare his candidacy,
his decisiveness in doing so stands in marked contrast to the coy
initial approaches made by other aspirants - a decisiveness that no
doubt comes naturally to a former Appeals Court judge.

Firm stand: And decisiveness is not the only quality that sets
candidate Li apart. While all the contestants in the race so far
claim that, as chief executive, they would consider comprehensive
consultation with the community-at-large in aid of reaching
consensus, Li has taken a firm stand in favour of governing Hong
Kong as it has always been governed: "I think that the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region's chief executive's administration
blueprint should include a comprehensive and detailed policy
programme. But this should be based on the existing tradition of
policy-making which has served Hong Kong so well," he says.

He is also candid in saying that he believes this programme cannot
be spelled out in detail at the present time, given that so many of
the variables on which it will ultimately depend will remain
unknown until after the formation of the first SAR government. But
his declaration in favour of maintaining the status quo differs
from the rather more prescriptive policy ideas being put forward by
the other candidates in laying out their vision of Hong Kong's
future.

As Li sees it, the chief executive's primary role will be to
faithfully implement the Basic Law. Otherwise, while he supports
the setting up of the Provisional Legislature simply out of legal
necessity, he would limit the scope of its activity to enacting
only the legislation needed to allow the new SAR government to
function; other legislation would wait to be dealt with in detail
after the establishment of the first elected SAR Legislative
Council.

Li also stands for preserving the apolitical role of the Civil
Service (including the disciplined services,) and ensuring that
civil servants have a solid grasp of the new concepts inherent in
the basic law as a prime expedient in maintaining Hong Kong's
promised autonomy. As well, he takes a holistic view of the way the
SAR will have to be governed, safeguarding the livelihood and
interests of the grassroots on the one hand while ensuring that
Hong Kong remains the investment destination of choice for both
local and international investors. And, not surprisingly, as a
former judge, he is a strong advocate of upholding the rule of law
in the territory.

Tung Chee-hwa, in his long-awaited policy testimonial, wants to
build the new Hong Kong's relationship with the mainland in a
spirit of seeking consensus built on mutual trust: "To stand up for
the interests of Hong Kong does not mean confrontation," he says.
He also laid emphasis on the need to ". . . talk more about our
duties, rather than our rights."

Key role: In his view, the SAR has a key role to play in the
modernization of China, helping it to take its natural place as an
international leader. At the strictly political level, he hopes to
elicit support in achieving the necessary consensus from all
political parties, including the Democrats. More broadly, he feels
that paying closer attention to traditional Chinese cultural values
could go a long way to ensuring a much more harmonious transition,
and they remain, according to Tung, ". . . as relevant today as
they have ever been."

What is more interesting is that the race, in the end, will be
likely to boil down to a choice between a candidate from either the
business or legal communities. And in choosing, Hong Kong will have
taken that all important first step in its journey of a thousand
li.

In predominantly business-oriented Hong Kong, it might seem obvious
that a businessman would be ideal, if only to ensure that one of
Hong Kong's major assets - its profitability - is preserved. But
the very things that make a businessman successful - an intense,
and perhaps somewhat narrow concentration on the bottom line -
could amount to disadvantages in executing what will certainly be
an arduous and many-dimensioned task in heading up the first SAR
government.

A legal person, on the other hand, particularly one who has devoted
a lifetime to serving society on the bench, has of necessity take a
broader view of the complex interactions of society, and through
this is likely to have a more cogent view of the interests of the
various sectors that make it up, both in a local and international
context.

This basic, fundamental choice is what will now make the contest of
compelling interest, both inside and outside Hong Kong.

HONGKONG: CRIME: A Haven for Horrors: Killers lurk among Lantau's hordes
of visitors 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By TOM IGGULDEN, P.6-7

LANTAU is becoming a haven for murderers and kidnappers, police on
the island say. With just one recorded murder last year, six bodies
have been discovered so far this year, according to the Lantau
North Assistant District Commander for crime, Liam Scally.

The island draws thousands of visitors every weekend, attracted by
cheap holiday villas and remote countryside. But the features that
lure the leisurely also make Lantau ideal for those who would avoid
the prying eyes of the cramped city.

Scally says the New Territories used to be the place of choice for
kidnappers to hold their hostages, and for murderers to dump their
victims' remains. But as development encroaches on Yuen Long,
Fanling and other traditional hide-out grounds, criminals are on
the lookout for less conspicuous places to pursue their activities.

Stranger: "With so many visitors coming here anyway, no one is
going to notice a stranger who stays for a weekend or a week," says
Scally. The island's steep hills, remote beaches and out-of-the-way
roads also make ideal terrain for body-dumping.

The body of Chan Lan-kiu, a 34-year-old insurance agent, was the
first to be discovered on the island this year. Her dismembered
corpse was found in about 10 pieces on February 16, more than a
week after it was dumped on a hillside at Ngong Ping.

It may never have been found if one of her alleged killers, Lo Yau-
fuk, 28, had not led police to the site in mid-February, 10 days
after Chan went missing. Chan's meticulous diary allegedly detailed
a scheduled meeting with Lo the day she disappeared.

He was detained at the Lo Wu border crossing attempting to leave
the territory.

Lo and Cheung Moon-keung, 29, are said to have shot Chan, loaded
her body into a van and driven to Shum Wat Road late at night to
dispose of the remains. They are alleged to have held her hostage
in a Mui Wo holiday villa, demanding a $300,000 ransom from her
family. Their trial is scheduled for January.

They have also been charged with two other murders on the island.
Police say they were led to two more bodies, those of Yung Tse-lun
and Chan Chik-yee, bound in cloth and buried under bushes in
shallow graves on a remote hillside at Lai Chi.

Though the area is sparsely populated, the bodies were found about
100m from the doorstep of resident Keith Addison, who has since
moved to Mui Wo.

"Certainly I would never have found them, even though they were so
close," he says. "They were buried and the area is very thick with
vegetation. It was scary to think that someone had come up and
buried these bodies 100 yards from my front door."

In early August, the body of a construction site foreman was found
in an abandoned hut near Tong Fuk pier. He was dressed only in
underpants, his throat had been slashed and he was covered in a
sheet of iron, his clothes beside the body.

Tong Fuk is a popular beach village with several holiday villas.
Police are still working on the case.

Later that month the body of Tam Ngan-hung washed up at Shap Long
Kau Tsuen, also on the popular southern Lantau beach strip. Tam's
naked body had been folded into a nylon bag, and red nylon string
had been tied around her head.

Kowloon West police are still investigating her killing. They
believe her body had been dumped into the sea at another beach on
Lantau.

The sixth killing on the island came to light early last month. Two
mainland workers had apparently fought over money - one battered
the other to death with a spade and later put the body in a plastic
bag and threw it into the sea. It floated for weeks until washing
up at Tung Chung New Town. The surviving mainlander later pleaded
guilty to the murder.

Worried: Addison says island-dwellers are worried about the sudden
surge in violence on Lantau. "They are concerned that among all
these visitors there are murderers and kidnappers. I think most
people think that as long as you leave them alone, they'll leave
you alone, but that doesn't mean they like it."

Andy Tsang, Senior Superintendent for Crime for New Territories
North, who is leading the investigation into the triple killing,
agrees Lantau is now more attractive to criminals than the New
Territories.

"People in the villages here aren't used to seeing a stranger, so
if they do they are more likely to remember it," he says. "I
wouldn't say we have seen a decline in murder in NT North, but I
would imagine it would take a lot longer to discover a body if it
were dumped on Lantau."

However, he says there is insufficient evidence yet to establish
whether a change is in progress. "The sample [six bodies in a year]
is too small too make a trend out of," he adds.

Scally says the island's holiday villas are also used by triad
debt-collectors to hide kidnap victims. "Let's say you run up a
gambling debt in Macau, then you return to Hong Kong rather than
pay it. The loansharks in Macau will sell the debt to their
contacts in Hong Kong, who are a lot more ruthless about collecting
it."

This usually means kidnapping either the debtor or a member of the
family for ransom. Scally says Lantau is increasingly playing host
to these kidnappings.

Tsang says the island is not necessarily the perfect place for
hiding a hostage or dumping a body. The ferry is the only access to
Lantau unless you have your own boat. Tsang says that if police are
able to follow a kidnapping trail to Lantau, finding the hostage
and the kidnapper is easier on the island than in the city. If a
criminal knows police are closing in, a quick getaway from the
island is almost impossible.

Tsang says murderers or kidnappers must also first lure their
victims to the island. A Lantau murder, he says, must be properly
planned and the murderer must have established some sort of
relationship with the victim before setting off for the island.

Extra police: Scally says stationing extra police on the island
would do little to contain the murder rate. All but one of the
killings this year were investigated by non-Lantau police divisions
because the victims were not residents. With throngs of visitors
every weekend, extra police at the Mui Wo ferry pier could do
little to identify "suspicious" characters.

Meanwhile Addison says the sudden jump in murders is a blow mainly
to the island's permanent residents. Addison, a long-time Lantau
resident, says he has always appreciated the island's slow pace of
change, even with the construction of the new airport at Chek Lap
Kok. "I do worry about things like this, though. I think it worries
everyone here."

SPORTS: Rafter Smashes And Grabs Title 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

P.5

Australia's Patrick Rafter stole the hearts of tennis teenyboppers
and netted US$200,000 as he powered his way to victory in the rain-
delayed final of the Marlboro Championships at Victoria Park on
Monday.

The 23-year-old Queenslander overcame American Vincent Spadea 6-2,
3-6, 6-2, 7-5 to take his first singles title since 1994. Rafter, a
former top 20 player now ranked 56th after an injury-plagued year,
was a clear crowd favourite. Scores of young female fans whoopped
at every point he won, and were "rewarded" by the sweat-soaked T-
shirt he threw into the crowd after clinching victory. Rafter
admitted the fans had given him a boost. "It's the kind of
attention I like. I'd be lying if I said I didn't." His
concentration was also tested by the prospects of a fat pay cheque,
the largest in his career so far. "I was thinking about the sum of
money [during the match] I have to admit. It's hard when you've got
that in your mind and it does make it difficult to play."

Rafter's blistering serves, clever drop volleys and accurate
smashes kept 22-year-old Spadea on the defensive. Ranked 65th in
the world, Spadea pocketed $65,000 for his gritty but, at times,
petulent performance. The American was a lucky entry into the semi-
finals, replacing injured fourth-seed and compatriot Richey
Reneberg to beat Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman.

The championships proved one of the most dramatic in its nine-year
history. Despite one of the strongest line-ups ever, none of the
top four seeds made it into the semi-finals. Lacklustre
performances saw the early exits of world No.1 Pete Sampras of the
US, No.3 Thomas Muster of Austria, and French Open champion and
No.4 Yevgenev Kafelnikov of Russia.

Sampras seemed as stunned as the capacity 4,000 crowd when he bowed
out to world 47th Byron Black of Zimbabwe in straight sets, 6-4, 6-
2. He later reflected: "I just couldn't get my game going. I was
digging a hole deeper and deeper with a lot of unforced errors."
But he denied that as it was a non-official ATP tournament, his
heart hadn't been in the match. "I play to win, I don't want to
lose to anyone. It hurts just as much as, say, losing the US Open."
Black, whose masterful return of serves constantly outwitted the
number one seed, failed to find the same form when he met Rafter in
the next round. The champion won 6-2, 5-7, 6-3.

Unseasonal heavy rains postponed the final by a day, allowing 2,500
fans to watch for free. The unseeded finalists proved the silver
lining in the dark clouds as higher-ranked players would have been
unlikely to play beyond Sunday due to other commitments.

CHINA DIARY: Making arduous efforts for the success of a new Long March:
Long March Commemorated 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

By DAVID CHEN, P.4

CHINA celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Long March this week
with President Jiang Zemin calling on the nation to carry forward
the revolutionary spirit of the epic event and push forward the
great undertakings initiated by old revolutionaries.

The event was marked by a soiree and a commemoration ceremony on
Monday and Tuesday in the Great Hall of the People, reported
Xinhua.

Sixty years ago, the Red Army, forerunner of the People's
Liberation Army, covered 12,500km, trekking through more than a
dozen provinces and municipalities, defeating numerous attacks by
Kuomintang forces and became strong through their historic feat.

It was in the critical Long March period that the Chinese Communist
Party held the Zunyi meeting, during which Mao Zedong was made the
leader of the Red Army and the party Central Committee, signalling
that the party had become mature, President Jiang told the
gathering at the commemoration ceremony.

He described the Long March as "a brilliant chapter in Chinese
history and the military history of the world."

The president, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party
and chairman of the Central Military Commission, urged party cadres
to follow the examples of the revolutionaries and learn to make
sacrifices, but not to seek comfort.

"It is completely wrong to think that now that we are materially
better off, we no longer need to strive hard and struggle," Jiang
added.

Spiritual force: "The spirit of the Long March," he said, "is a
strong spiritual force that guarantees our marching from victory to
victory."

Looking forward to the next century, President Jiang said the party
had created Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and established the basic line and a
series of principles and policies, as well as a development
strategy in three phases, and a cross-century blueprint.

"The crux of the matter for the moment," Jiang said, "is to fully
implement those lines, principles and policies and make enormous
and arduous efforts for the success of a new Long March."

It has been a busy week for President Jiang on the diplomatic
front, greeting heads of state and senior foreign government
officials as well as prominent businessmen.

The most notable meeting he has had was with the German Foreign
Minister, Klaus Kinkel, whose planned visit scheduled for early
this year was postponed because of the adoption of a resolution by
the German parliament on the Tibet issue. China regarded the
parliamentary action as interference with the country's internal
affairs. Discussions and exchanges during the intervening months
have resolved the controversy and Kinkel's visit signified the
return of the very warm relationship between the two countries. Not
only did Kinkel have a series of intensive and fruitful sessions
with his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, but the visitor was also
received by President Jiang and Premier Li Peng.

Noting the resumption of the friendly ties, President Jiang
observed: "As long as the two sides earnestly abide by the
principles of mutual respect, seeking a common ground while putting
aside differences, non-interference in each other's internal
affairs and equality and mutual benefits , there will be good
prospects for relations between the two countries."

He welcomed the minister to China, noting that Kinkel's main task
was to make preparations for the German president's visit.
"President Roman Herzog's visit is an important event in bilateral
relations," Jiang said, adding that he was looking forward to
meeting with him.

Premier Li said that Sino-German relations should be oriented to
the future, recent twists and difficulties in these ties having
coming to an end.

Economic and trade cooperation between the two countries had
achieved marked results and bilateral cooperation in various fields
had brought about benefits for both sides, he added.

Li also met German businessmen in Kinkel's entourage, noting that
Germany's business circle had made positive contributions to the
healthy development of bilateral ties.

President Jiang also met the chairman of the Russian Federation
Council, Yegor Semeonovich Stroyev, expressing the belief that the
latter's visit would become a milestone in exchanges between the
parliaments of the two countries.

THIS WEEK: Last Run for Long Rally 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

THE 555 Hong Kong-Beijing Auto Rally got off to a rousing start on
Saturday from Stonecutters Island, in Hong Kong, on what will be
the last race under the present format. Next year, the 3,800-
kilometre race will be shortened to three days, centering on
Beijing and following a world championship format. The defending
champion Kenneth Eriksson from Sweden was soon in trouble when his
Subaru crashed on stage 12, the longest in the event.

His closest competitor in the 52-car race is Ari Vatanen. If either
of them win, they will be the first drivers to take the event
twice. The rally, which was inaugurated in 1985 and held seven
times, will conclude today in Beijing. Only 27 of the 52 starters
remain in the race.

THIS WEEK: Tin Sentenced 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

HENFREY Tin Sau-kwong, a tobacco dealer and alleged triad enforcer,
was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in jail for what the
sentencing judge, Justice Wally Yeung Chung-kuen, described as an
elaborate bid to frighten a vital prosecution witness into
withdrawing his evidence.

Tin, 47, a close associate of sacked Independent Commission against
Corruption deputy director Alex Tsui Ka-kit, admitted conspiring to
pervert the course of justice by intimidating and threatening Tommy
Chui To-yan. Chui, who was to give evidence in a multibillion-
dollar smuggling and corruption trial, was murdered in Singapore in
March last year.

Tin pleaded guilty to trying to persuade a witness not to give
evidence after a plea bargain in which the prosecution dropped a
charge of conspiracy to murder.

THIS WEEK: KCRC to Slash WCR Staff 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

APPARENTLY bowing to public pressures for its huge spending on
consultancy studies, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corp is to dismiss an
unspecified number of consultants working on the controversial
Western Corridor Railway.

The company currently employs 267 people, mostly from consultancy
firms, in its West Rail division. It has been reported that half of
the staff might be sacked because of the KCRC's decision to scale
down the technical studies needed for the railway project. The cost
of the scaled-down technical studies will be slashed from $750
million to $230 million.

a $233 million funding for the June 30, 1997 ceremony marking the

THIS WEEK: No Thanks to Governor

LEGISLATORS refused to give the traditional vote of thanks to
Governor Chris Patten after his annual policy speech, the first
time the motion has been voted down.

Legislators voted 23 to 22 to reject the vote of thanks for the
speech given earlier this month, which some law-makers angrily
attacked as arrogant in attributing Hong Kong's success to British
rule. Unionist legislator Lee Cheuk-yan's amendment approved last
week expressing deep regret over Britain's "deprivation" of
democratic rights to Hong Kong people also went down with the
motion of thanks.

THIS WEEK: Jiang Hails Long March 

from WINDOW, October 25, 1996

CHINESE President Jiang Zemin hailed the Long March as the greatest
revolutionary achievement in Chinese history at a Beijing ceremony
to mark the 60th anniversary of the odyssey. Jiang said the march,
led by the late Chairman Mao Zedong, marked the turning point in
the communist struggle against the nationalists and Japanese
invaders and should be upheld as a permanent monument to the
Chinese revolution.

He urged younger cadres show the same commitment as the Red Army
members, some of whom attended the ceremony, who marched nearly
12,500 kilometres across 11 provinces 60 years ago. (See pages 4,
