<CENTER><H2>What is Biomass Power?</H2>
<p>DOE/GO-10095-166, Published May 1995</CENTER>
<P><p>Biomass is all around us. It can be found in trees, grasses, and
ocean plants. Biomass is produced from these growing, living plants
through photosynthesis&#151;the process by which plant matter is
formed using the energy of sunlight. The leaves, stems, bark,
and wood ignite processes to generate electricity. If biomass
is cultivated and harvested in a sustainable cycle that is repeated,
there is no net contribution to global warming. 
<P>
Biomass energy
is used to make electricity, liquid fuels, gaseous fuels, and
a variety of useful chemicals, including those currently manufactured
from petroleum. Because the energy in biomass is less concentrated
than the energy in fossil fuels, new technologies are required
to make this energy resource competitive with coal, oil, and natural
gas. Industry and agriculture need superior energy crops and cost-effective
conversion technologies to expand the use of renewable biomass.
<p>
When used as a fuel, biomass feedstocks (such as dried, chopped vegetation etc.) can be used in power plants the same way nonrenewable fossil fuels are used to generate electricity. This is called <I>biomass power.</I>
<P>
Biomass is one of the oldest fuels known to human kind. But the
primitive campfire is a far cry from the technology that runs
a modern biomass power station.
<P>
In the last two decades, biomass power has become the second largest
renewable source of electricity after hydropower. Similar to hydropower,
biomass plants provide baseload power to utilities. Biomass power
plants are fully dispatchable&#151;they operate on demand whenever
electricity is required.
<P>
If biomass is cultivated and harvested properly, it is a renewable
resource that can be used to generate electricity on demand, with
no net contribution to global carbon dioxide.
<P>
<STRONG>Biomass Power Today</STRONG><BR>
Biomass power has developed into a diverse industry. About 350
biomass power plants with a combined rated capacity of 7000 megawatts
(MW) feed electricity into the nation's power lines, while another
650 enterprises generate electricity with biomass for their own
use as cogenerators. The biomass power industry employs more than
66,000 people nationwide in skilled jobs ranging from equipment
manufacturing and plant operations to agricultural activities.
Today's biomass power plants primarily use residues from the farm
and wood-products industries.
