<h2 ALIGN=center> Get a Good Night's Rest </h2>


Today, people tend to be working more and resting less. In fact, for most people, there aren't enough hours in the day for all that needs to be accomplished, so they steal from the night. According to the Better Sleep Council, over the last century, Americans have cut the average nightly hours of sleep by more than 20 percent.<p>


According to American Demographics, adults who sleep six or fewer hours each night are significantly more likely than those who get more sleep to feel stressed every day. In contrast, only 14 percent of adults who sleep seven to eight hours each night feel stress daily.<p>


<BR>





Good sleep habits are vital to stress prevention. To build good sleep habits, consider the following:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stick to a schedule. Get up and go to bed at the same time each day.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Exercise regularly. Exercise encourages sleep by burning off tensions. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Avoid stimulants. Drink caffeinated drinks no closer than six to eight hours before your bedtime.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Buy a good bed. Choose a bed that offers both comfort and support.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stop smoking. Nicotine is a stronger stimulant than caffeine.<BR>


<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Skip the after-dinner drink. Alcohol makes it more difficult to stay asleep.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Strive for quality sleep. Don't feel you have to sleep eight hours; seven may be enough for you.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Set aside worries. Deal with them the next day.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Skip high-fat snacks before bedtime. If you're hungry, eat a low-calorie snack, like a banana or an apple.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Relax before going to bed. Listen to music, take a warm bath, or read a book before going to sleep.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Keep your bedroom quiet, comfortable, dark and cool. Keep yourself warm with a blanket or comforter.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Avoid using your bedroom as your office or television room.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Lose weight. People who are overweight tend to snore more, which can lead to inadequate sleep.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Be wary of over-the-counter sleep aids. Talk to your doctor about sleep medications.<BR>



<BR>



</ul>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Run For the Health of It </h2>


For those who haven't broken a sweat in some time, begin slowly with any exercise program. Just like a well-built house, a new running program will need to have a solid foundation first. <p>


<BR>

 The best way to establish this foundation is to mix walking and jogging when you begin your program. You should do your running regimen every other day or at least three days a week. <p>
<BR>


To build your personalized running program, consider these precautions for exercising safely:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Let your exercise endurance build gradually. Don't try to do too much too soon or soreness will set in and you won't want to continue exercising.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Include stretching, warmup and cool-down segments in each running session. Stretching the major muscles will help you avoid injuries. Walking before running will warm your muscles up. And, walking again at the end and then stretching again will cool your body safely back down. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Pay attention to pain warnings. If your joints, feet, ankles, or legs ache, it could be an early warning that further stress could result in a worse injury. Treat these painful warnings with rest and over-the-counter pain relievers.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Stop exercising if you feel pain in your chest. This could be a sign of heart attack and further exercise could damage your heart seriously. Any pain or pressure in the left or mid-chest area, left neck, shoulder, or arm, sudden lightheadedness, cold sweat, pallor, or fainting should tell you to stop exercising and call your doctor.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Suit your attire and preparation to your weather conditions:  <BR>
	For hot and humid areas, exercise in the early morning before sunrise or early evening after the sunset when it's cooler, adapt to the heat for a week before undergoing rigorous routines, drink lots of water, look for the signs of heat stroke (dizziness, weakness, lightheadedness, tiredness, lack of sweat, or dangerously high body temperature), wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothes, and avoid wearing rubberized or plastic weight loss suits or sweatshirts and sweat pants since they won't help you lose weight any faster (you only sweat more) and could cause heat stroke.<BR>
	For cold areas, wear layered clothing but wear one less layer than you would if you were outside and not exercising, protect your hands with mittens, gloves, or cotton socks, and wear a hat or cap to retain heat since almost 40 percent of your body's heat is lost through your neck and head.<BR>
	For rainy, icy, or snowy areas, realize that visibility levels and traction will be lower for both you and any drivers on nearby roads.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Eat meals at least two hours before you exercise and don't eat until at least 20 minutes after completing your exercising.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Select good running shoes that have proper cushioning in the soles.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Run on soft, even surfaces such as grass fields, dirt paths, or tracks instead of cement or hilly places that are rough on your feet and joints.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> As you run, land on the heels of your feet instead of on the balls of your feet to minimize strain on your feet and lower legs.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Watch for cars and wear reflective clothing if you run on a road at night. You'll see cars well before their drivers see you.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> When weather does prevent your normal running routine, visit your local mall and walk for double the time you would have jogged.<BR>



<BR>

For more information, contact your local American Heart Association or call 1-800-242-8721.

<h2 ALIGN=center> Fight Heart Disease with Heart Healthy Eating </h2>


Your food habits are one of the major risk factors for heart disease, but you can control them! To decrease your risk of heart disease, your eating plan should contain less saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. <p>


<BR>





The American Heart Association (AHA) suggests abiding by these guidelines:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Your daily fat intake should be less than 30 percent of your total daily calories.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Saturated fatty acid intake should be less than 10 percent of your total daily calories. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Polyunsaturated fatty acid intake should be no more than 10 percent of your total daily calories.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Monounsaturated fatty acids should be about 10 to 15 percent of your total daily calories.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Cholesterol daily intake should not exceed 300 milligrams.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Sodium intake should be no more than 3,000 milligrams daily.<BR>



<BR>

Since adhering to those more technical recommendations may be tedious with all the calculating, the AHA also wants to pass along these tips:<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Eat nonfat products. Fruits, vegetables and their juices are low in fat and valuable nutritionally. Other nonfat products can be substituted for their fatty counterparts with little or no loss of taste. For example, substitute angel food cake for devil's food cake or nonfat salad dressing for regular salad dressing.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Select products low in fat. Use mustard, ketchup, or low-fat mayonnaise instead of regular mayonnaise to complement sandwiches. Choose baked foods over fried ones.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Buy lean meats. Fish, chicken, turkey and lean cuts of beef and pork are wise choices. You should only have two to three servings of meat daily. A serving is three ounces or about the size of a deck of cards.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Switch to low-fat milk. Work at gradually reducing the fat content of the milk you drink. Start with two percent, move to one percent, then to half percent and finally to skim milk. Low-fat buttermilk is a tasteful alternative to whole milk and substituting evaporated skim milk for cream or half-n-half is wise.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Try low-fat and nonfat cheeses and dairy products. Instead of regular cheese, choose low- or nonfat varieties including cottage cheese, reduced-fat ricotta cheese and skim milk mozzarella cheese.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Enjoy low-fat desserts. Enjoy a frozen fruit bar instead of an ice cream bar, and choose sherbet, frozen low-fat yogurt, or ice milk instead of traditional ice cream.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Cut the fat out of your bread, cereal and pasta selections. Eat a bagel instead of a doughnut, cereal instead of pastries, and warm corn tortillas instead of biscuits. Baked potatoes and pasta are very low in fat if you avoid high-fat toppings.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Eat eggs, but throw out the yolk first. Use the egg whites or choose an egg substitute to make scrambled eggs, omelets, nonfat frostings, cakes, cookies and muffins. Remember that it takes two egg whites to equal one whole egg.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Avoid fried foods. Choose from baking, broiling, steaming, boiling, poaching, or microwaving.<BR>



<BR>
<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Learn to enjoy the true taste of foods. Avoid drowning in gravies, sauces and other toppings.<BR>



<BR>



</ul>

<BR>


<img src="graphics/nov96d.gif" align=right hspace=20>





<h2 ALIGN=center> Protect Against Periodontal Disease </h2>


Daily brushing and flossing are essential to proper dental care. Without proper care, periodontal disease – disorders which affect the gums and other supporting structures around the teeth – may set in. If this happens you risk tooth loss, and if left untreated, bone damage. <p>


<BR>

 The symptoms of peridontal disease are: red and swollen gums, bad breath, gum bleeding when brushing teeth, sensitivity to hot, cold, or sweet foods and liquids, and loose teeth.<p>
<BR>



To avoid peridontal disease:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Brush your teeth daily (at least twice).<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Use a toothpaste that contains fluoride. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Control oral bacteria with an antiseptic mouthwash. A mild solution of one part hydrogen peroxide to 10 parts water helps kill bacteria.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Floss your teeth daily to remove plaque.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Visit your dentist regularly.<BR>



<BR>



</ul>



<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>

<BR>


<img src="graphics/nov96e.gif" align=left hspace=20>





<h2 ALIGN=center> Get a Grip on Your Temper </h2>


If you blow your top often over things that aren't all that important, you must get a grip on your anger before it takes over your life – and destroys your relationships. <p>


<BR>





When you notice anger creeping up on you, challenge it by taking these steps:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Negotiate peace. Replace your anger-producing thoughts with thoughts of mercy toward others.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Offer alternatives to becoming angry. Instead of growing angry toward someone who is short with you, put yourself in their shoes before passing judgment. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Write a peace treaty. Jot down thoughts and other items that ignite your anger and analyze them realistically. This will usually cause you to see situations more rationally.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Get your mind off your anger. Take a break by distracting yourself with something you enjoy.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stop what you're doing and exercise. Exercise produces endorphins in the brain which naturally improve your mood. Relaxation techniques work just as well. Try taking several deep breaths if exercise isn't possible.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Let your anger take its course – alone. Go somewhere by yourself for at least 20 minutes. Return with a relaxed mind and look at the anger-producing situation with clear thoughts.<BR>
<BR>



</ul>




<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>

<BR>


<img src="graphics/nov96f.gif" align=right hspace=20>





<h2 ALIGN=center> Develop Self-Discipline to Succeed </h2>


Would you like to improve the quality of your life? Then commit to positive lifestyle changes and overcome self-defeating habits. To do so, develop the power of self-discipline. <p>


<BR>





Self-discipline means you work wholeheartedly and continuously toward a goal until it's achieved. Develop your self-discipline with these easy steps:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Decide upon your mission. Write down five things you want most in life. Some may seem dreamy but others will be achievable. Combine them into one statement that summarizes your goals in life.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Set goals. Goals work as self-fulfilling prophecies. Whatever level of success you set your sights on is usually as high as you'll go. So, set your goals high. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Take action consistently. Obstacles may impede your progress. Jump over them by identifying possible obstacles ahead of time so you can handle them efficiently and productively if they occur. Keep going even through obstacles.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Visualize your success. Close your eyes and see yourself as the success you want to be. Your brain often converts images into reality.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Enjoy the pursuit of your goals. If you truly desire goal achievement, you'll enjoy working toward the goals. Pursue your goals with a positive attitude.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Focus on the tasks at hand. Life in today's society is complex. To truly succeed, you have to be able to forget about other matters and concentrate on what's happening before you.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Eliminate excuses. When you falter from time to time, don't fall back into old patterns by using an excuse. Focus on what you've already accomplished.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Reward yourself. When you achieve your goal, take time to reward yourself because you worked hard to get where you are.<BR>

<BR>



</ul>

<BR>


<img src="graphics/nov96g.gif" align=left hspace=20>





<h2 ALIGN=center> Pinpoint Your Body's Peak Times </h2>


During the day, your body undergoes many changes. Your mental, physical and emotional condition goes through summits, plateaus and valleys. Your body has a definite rhythm in which your blood pressure, body temperature, hormonal production and other bodily functions follow. <p>


<BR>

 Some people rise early in the morning and spring forward to face their day but start running on empty in the early evening. Others begin their day slowly but hit their peak in the early evening and work late into the night. Good timing of daily activities is important. <p>
<BR>



Most studies would agree that there really is a "best time" to do things. Consider these tips:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Eat wise. In most cases, modern research supports this advice, "Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper." This eating plan can improve energy levels and help you lose weight since your body burns more calories while you're active.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Exercise when it's best for you. If you're trying to lose weight, working out at lunch or before dinner may suppress your appetite. If you work, exercising during lunch time may help you overcome the afternoon "slump" at the office. If you do work out during lunch, also be sure to eat a light, healthy lunch. And remember, exercising too close to bedtime may make you so charged up you can't sleep. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Map your ups and downs. If you struggle with figuring out your rhythm, keep a log of your accomplishments during the day. Review the times of the day when you tend to accomplish the most. Then, focus on important activities during these times.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Take your medications on time. Whether you take your medication during the day or night can make a difference in what it does to your body. Always follow your doctor's advice on when to take medications.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Educate yourself when you're ready to learn. The best time to learn is when you feel your alertness is in full swing. Often, late-night studying may give you the edge on tomorrow's test, but not on long-term recall.<BR>



<BR>



</ul>
