<h1>The National Health Care Debate of 1994</h1>
<h2>by Phil Benjamin</h2>
<p> Advocates of reforming the health care system - promised by 
President Clinton in the 1992 elections - have been 
successful in preventing the corporate health care industry 
from enacting anti-people health legislation in the 1993-94 
Congress. This must be seen as a victory, not a defeat. 
While such an assessment may seem to make a positive out of 
a negative, the facts speak for themselves. </p>

<p> Let's look at the history of this health care reform 
effort. As the old adage says, "those who fail to learn from 
history are doomed to repeat it." After extensive public 
hearings, the Clintons introduced their very "moderate" 
health bill in the fall of 1993. Progressives immediately 
saw the weaknesses in this bill, especially its pro-
insurance company bias, but publicly withheld their 
criticisms. </p>

 <p>This period of time required having a flexible approach to 
the Clinton program, even though everyone knew the 
president's legislation must be improved. While continuing 
to garner supporters for the single-payer legislation, they 
struggled to improve the Clinton bill through intensive 
lobbying and political struggle. But by early 1994 it became 
clear that the Clintons and their congressional supporters 
were hell-bent on passing any legislation, regardless of its 
content. By that time, the handwriting was on the wall.</p>

<p> That "compromise for passage" approach of the White House 
and congressional leaders sent a very clear message to the 
health care profiteers. "We won't fight you," rather, "we 
will work with you in getting a bill that you favor passed." 
In fact, the White House, along with the Senate's collection 
of George Mitchells and Pat Moynihans, would not pass any 
legislation that did not have monopoly's support. 
Significantly, the House Democrats, with the exception of 
the single-payer leaders, took a back seat during the whole 
process. Each of these House members knew they had to face 
re-election in the fall of 1994. They were caught between 
health industry campaign contributions and the desires of 
their constituents.</p>

<p> By this time, Clinton had revealed his true colors with the 
crude tactics he used to win passage of NAFTA. As the summer 
of 1994 approached, the Clinton administration's reputation 
was at an all-time low among labor and community people. </p>

 <p>From late winter through spring, the mad grab for profits 
and power became painfully clear when Met Life combined its 
health-profit business with The Travelers. Metrahealth, the 
new corporate name, anticipates a customer base of 13 
million and $17.6 billion in revenue. Two of the "Big 5" 
leaders in the insurance industry saw the future and acted 
accordingly. </p>

<p> The "smaller" insurance carriers in the Health Insurance 
Association of America, who are not among the Big Five, 
scrambled for their market share. Fearing they would be left 
out of legislation, they conducted an advertising campaign 
against the White House proposals. This campaign, which cost 
over $15 million, was credited with putting a lethal knife 
in the heart of health care reform. </p>

 <p>It is important to understand the reasons why the campaign 
succeeded. The ad campaign demagogically raised legitimate 
questions in people's minds such as how do you guarantee 
universal health care in a system run by the insurance and 
drug monopolies? The ad campaign cleverly played on this 
sentiment.</p>

<p> The campaign of the "smaller" insurance companies was 
effective with the mass media and some leading members of 
Congress. It galvanized the anti-reform forces to increase 
their activities against any government involvement. The 
"Big Five" didn't shed any tears, since they knew they were 
on the winning side in any game being proposed by the White 
House. They would garner the lion's share of the profits, 
regardless of the current legislative outcome. </p>

<p> It appeared that the Big Five would have settled for a 
Medicare-style bill that would guarantee these giant 
corporations super-profits. As third-party intermediaries, 
the insurance carriers do very well under a program modeled 
after the current Medicare program. In order to gain their 
support, the White House assured these insurance monopolies 
a level of super profits, similar to their third-party role 
in Medicare.</p>

<p> In spite of the attacks on health care reform, polls 
continued to show the people's confidence in government 
involvement in health financing and delivery. Opinion polls 
expressed satisfaction with government insurance programs 
such as Federal Social Security, Federal Social Disability 
Insurance, Medicare, Unemployment Insurance and even, to 
some extent, Workers' Compensation. Many veterans still rely 
on their federal veterans benefits, including what is left 
of the veteran hospital system. Compared to their horrid 
experience with the private insurance company system, the 
choice was obvious. The hatred of the private insurance 
carriers remains at an all-time high. These polls were 
deliberately kept out of the public eye.</p>

<p> Editorialists from the New York Times to commercial 
television continually supported the most conservative 
congressional legislation. They constantly heaped uncritical 
praise on privatization proposals. Politicians, however, 
were well aware of the public sentiment for national health 
care. While they wouldn't stand up to their friends in the 
corporate health care industry, they also feared incurring 
the wrath of the voters. This was the main reason for the 
failure of Congress to act. Even with all the power and 
wealth of the transnational health monopolies, Congress was 
forced not to pass a pro-monopoly bill.</p>

 <h4>Monopolization</h4>

<p> All during this period, major consolidation moves in the 
profit-making hospital field were taking place. Columbia 
Health Care (CHC), the country's largest profit chain, 
bought the Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) for $5.6 
billion. That chain became even bigger when the Wall Street 
Journal reported that, on October 6, Columbia/HCA bought 
Health/Trust Inc. for $3.6 billion in newly-issued stock. 
This deal, if it holds up, will increase Columbia/HCA to 311 
hospitals with 170,00 employees and an estimated $15 billion 
in annual revenue. The Wall Street Journal reported that the 
Federal Trade Commission will review the transaction, but 
there is little doubt that it will be approved. </p>

<p> A week after the Columbia/HCA transaction, National Medical 
Enterprises (NME) bought American Medical Holdings for 
almost $2 billion. This keeps NME as the second largest for-
profit hospital chain with 71 hospitals, 63,200 employees 
and revenues over $5 billion. NME recently paid a record 
$380 million to settle federal criminal charges after 
pleading guilty to six counts of paying kickbacks in the 
referral of Medicare, patients and one count of conspiracy 
to make illegal payments.</p>

<p> With these previous and current dealings, the profit-making 
hospital system is clearly yet another monopoly influence 
peddler throwing its weight around in Congress and in the 
Clinton administration.</p>

 <h4>Figures Don't Lie, Liars Figure</h4>

 <p>Another feature of the great health care reform period of 
1993-94 was the barrage of facts and figures that every side 
used to push its point. Think tanks on all sides were busy 
grinding out studies that supported their positions. 
Clearly, if the playing grounds were level and logic had its 
day, the objective situation presented by the progressive 
forces would have prevailed. The extensive public hearings 
held by Hillary Clinton's Administrative Task Force, during 
the first part of 1994, pointed the congressional debate 
toward a progressive conclusion. If there was ever any truth 
to the adage "Figures don't lie, liars figure" this was the 
year. </p>

<p> But figures were not the only weapons being misused. The 
redefinition of words took on a whole new level when every 
player in the game said that their program was "universal." 
Those assertions were not adequately challenged.</p>

<p> When it became clear that everyone in Congress was trying 
to include a benefit to senior citizens in the form of a 
Medicare prescription drug program, the transnational drug 
corporations sprang into action. Since any Medicare 
prescription drug program would be significantly determined 
by government regulation, each drug transnational vied for 
an advantage. One way to gain the most profit was by 
eliminating the competition. Thus the increasing 
monopolization of the international drug cartels had a 
profound effect on the health care debate. </p>

 <p>The drug transnationals Eli Lilly (PCS Health Systems), 
Smith Kline and Beecham (the British transnational), 
Diversified Pharmaceuticals, and Merck (Medco Containment) 
bought drug purchasing companies so that they, as 
manufacturers, could control the flow of their drugs. These 
purchasing companies were set up to arrange the purchase of 
drugs at discounted prices for employers, labor unions and 
other large consumers. Billions of dollars changed hands in 
these transactions. For example, Lilly purchased PCS for $4 
billion. This is all the more remarkable since PCS had 
profits in the low millions. This acquisition will affect 
over 51 million people or 20 percent of the U.S. population. 
Lilly's intention was quite clear.</p>

<p> Smith Kline and Beecham purchased Diversified for $2.3 
billion, and Merck paid $6.6 billion for Medco. In another 
major drug company transaction, Roche Holding bought Syntax 
for $5.3 billion. To top off this orgy of billion-dollar 
transitions, American Home Products bought American Cyanamid 
for an incredible $8.5 billion.</p>

 <p>All of these drug manufactures have honed their extensive 
kickback schemes to physicians and hospitals/health centers 
to gain an even greater competitive advantage. These 
kickbacks are the subject of Senate investigation. In the 
meantime they continue to take place and the general public, 
especially senior citizens, are being taken advantaged of. </p>

<p> The business sections of newspapers were replete with 
articles about these transactions. To boost this profit 
direction, the Wall Street Journal's (August 25, 1994) front 
page story stated, "With Congress Stalled Health Care is 
Shaped by the Private Sector." To put some brakes on this 
movement, once the barn door was closed, the Journal 
cautioned that anti-trust laws were certainly being 
violated.</p>

 <p>Therefore, while the insurance companies are often pointed 
to by some as the culprit for the high costs of health care, 
other members of the transnational health monopolies are 
also involved. That includes the drug monopolies, profit-
making hospital chains, medical equipment and supply 
companies and international financial organizations.</p>

 <h4>Self-Destructive Competition</h4>

<p> All of these outfits were united to kill any progressive 
legislation. Once they were assured that the White House was 
not advocating a progressive health bill, each corporation 
and industrial association set about gaining their own 
advantage within the context of some kind of federal health 
legislation. This competitive advantage lobbying sent 
members of Congress and their staffs into a tizzy. Hundreds 
of millions of dollars were spent in lobbying Congress. 
Millions were spent in contributions in the 1994 
congressional elections. This period of time became a 
bonanza of money for elected and aspiring politicians and 
"Beltway" consultants. </p>

<p> A September, 1994 Citizen Action report found that the 
health and insurance industry gave candidates $13.6 million 
from January through June, 1994, a 96 percent increase over 
the previous comparable period. This compares to a 10 
percent jump in non-health related industry contributions.</p>

<p> This new situation gave a conservative compromiser like 
Clinton headaches. It seemed that a new bipartisan proposal, 
engineered by combinations of monopoly capital, was coming 
down the pike every month to satisfy the profiteers. Each 
proposal pushed the health care debate further to the right 
and against the health care of everyday people. This 
bipartisan, monopoly effort contained more Democrats than 
Republicans. Who said there isn't a dimes worth of 
difference between the two parties of monopoly? </p>

<p> Republican Party policy, led by Senate leader Bob Dole, 
after initially beginning with the then- obligatory 
allegiance to "we also want health care reform," easily 
settled into their more comfortable pro-monopoly position. 
In this instance, however, the Republicans could sit back 
and watch the Democrats kill themselves. </p>

 <p>Contradictions in the drive among competing corporate 
interests in the drug, insurance, profit-making hospital 
chains, medical supply and equipment and financial 
corporations to gain advantage over each other contributed 
to their own legislative downfall.  </p>

<h4>People's Power: The Decisive Factor</h4>

<p> The main ingredient in this anti-people, profit lobbying 
mix that proved to be the decisive factor was the people 
themselves. As indicated, polls showed the overriding 
sentiment for a national (universal) system of health care. 
The single-payer movement developed to carry the fight into 
the halls of Congress. The leaders of that movement came 
from important sections of the labor movement and major 
community groups. It was and remains a broad and effective 
political movement.</p>

<p> Representative Jim McDermott of Washington State (one of 
only two physicians in Congress) in the House and Senator 
Paul Wellstone from Minnesota, gave congressional leadership 
to the movement. Labor and community leaders were relentless 
in lobbying members of Congress in their home offices or in 
Washington. Rallies were held in Washington and in every 
large town voicing the cry, "no profits in health care." The 
people's message was heard. The movement didn't get what we 
wanted, but it did stop the health care industry from 
enacting its own legislation. Given the balance of forces, 
this must be seen as a peoples' victory.</p>

 <p>From the outset, the labor movement had two general 
viewpoints. These viewpoints reflected the two political 
strains in the organized labor movement in the U.S. One 
trend generally fights for its members by struggling against 
monopoly capital, and the other collaborates with big 
business. The basic difference in the approaches is between 
class- struggle trade unionism and class collaboration. </p>

<p> The collaborationists were lead by AFL-CIO President Lane 
Kirkland. They helped organize and/or joined joint labor and 
management committees as the way to gain health care reform. 
Some of these committees even included the insurance 
companies. White House and Congressional leaders loved this 
collaboration strategy. They knew that ultimately, after 
some loud talk, these labor leaders would agree to anything 
the White House and its corporate supporters would put 
forward. </p>

<p> But progressive and left-of-center international unions did 
not agree with the Kirkland sellout and fought against it. 
Kirkland and his right-wing allies fought hard against the 
anti-profit health care group. While the single-payer 
movements strength came from the progressive unions, 
Kirkland's collaboration stopped a united front against the 
monopolies from being formed. Votes in the AFL-CIO's Health 
Committee were routinely divided down the middle, eight for 
single-payer and eight against. There are opportunities to 
win a few of the latter group away from Kirkland. </p>

<h4> Single-Payer: a Compromise Itself</h4>

<p> In his September 5, 1994 speech, McDermott called for an 
end to the congressional health reform effort since the 
debate had moved too far toward an anti-people health bill. </p>

<p> In his remarks he made an impassioned plea to his corporate 
constituency. While his stand for the single-payer 
legislation was more than admirable, he showed his 
limitations when he said that corporations had nothing to 
fear from the single-payer proposal. After all, he said, 
only the financing would be government organized. The 
delivery of health care, he assured, would remain in private 
hands. </p>

<p> McDermott as much as said that his legislation was not the 
same as socialized medicine. This is not Great Britain, he 
argued, it is just like the Canadian system. Physician fee-
for-service and private hospitals and clinics were to be 
preserved. Clearly, he is sending the wrong message - being 
unfairly critical of a superior health program in order to 
sell yours is the wrong path to go down. </p>

<p> At the turn of 1994, the single-payer movement felt that 
large corporations, such as the auto industry, would benefit 
from a single-payer-style approach. The auto manufacturers 
were looking for a way to reduce or unload their health 
benefits, averaging about $800 per car, onto the federal 
treasury. While those positions were stated behind closed 
doors, these same corporate giants never had a mass media 
campaign to win their point of view. There are probably too 
many health industry monopolists on their boards of 
directors. The argument for socializing the financing of 
health care carried some weight. And since a significant 
number of people in this country are already covered through 
a government-run financing mechanism, this would not be 
perceived as a radical solution. It all seemed to make 
sense.</p>

<p> The debates at this time were among health-care advocates 
who were part of the health-care scene for years. The 
debating lines were drawn and logic seemed to be carrying 
the day. But a new feature came through in this period when 
a group organized in 1992-93, called the "Jackson Hole 
Group," came into the fray. Named for a corporate retreat in 
Wyoming, the "Jackson Hole Group" represented the 
concentration of profit power in the health industry. While 
it seemed to have a distinct U.S. tinge, in fact, it also 
represented the combined power of transnational health 
profiteers. </p>

 <p>At first they were not taken seriously. At the time their 
crude profits-above-all-else approach seemed so obvious as 
to render them without any credibility. </p>

<p> The "Jackson Hole Group," which brought the crudest form of 
lobbying to the halls of Congress, saw all too well the 
logic and effectiveness of the single-payer compromise. 
Although they saw its value in nudging out the far more 
progressive and logical method of delivering health care, 
that is, the British National Health Service ( the financing 
and delivery system of the BNHS is in government hands, not 
insurance companies), they waged a fierce campaign to defeat 
single-payer. </p>

<p> Progressive health care advocates remember that in the 
1970s Congressman Ronald V. Dellums had proposed a national 
health service for this country. The largest health care 
organization in the world, the American Public Health 
Association, endorsed that proposal. Practitioners in the 
health care field supported this proposal because it began 
to deal with the discrimination in the delivery of health 
care which leads to wide disparity of health status. It also 
dealt with the unfair financing of health care. Prevention 
of disease is a main ingredient of a national health 
service. This legislation is still alive and well. </p>
<p>The Communist Party, USA has long endorsed and fought for a 
fully government-run and financed health care system. But, 
all of these pro-people forces coalesced behind the single-
payer movement, given the tactical and strategic position 
that it was in. The single-payer proposal was a giant step 
along the way toward the goal of national health service (at 
least for those who have that as their goal). </p>

 <p>The staying power of Congressman McDermott and the almost 
100 congressional single-payer supporters was made possible 
by labor and the grass- roots movement. There was an 
understanding of the limitations of a single-payer approach, 
but they realized its power in deflecting the organized 
profit group led by the "Jackson Hole" mob. The failure of 
that profit group to win congressional approval for its 
program is a real victory. </p>

<p> The single-payer strategy proved to be an effective one. 
But in the upcoming struggle a more advanced strategy will 
be required. Indeed, the legislative solutions have to be 
expanded to meet the health care crises that continue to 
escalate.</p>

 <h4>The CIA Factor</h4>

 <p>Another factor which also must be included in the health 
debates is the fact that the U.S. government, through its 
CIA operatives, has been successfully overturning 
governments throughout the world on the basis that 
government programs do not work. The privatization taking 
place in the former socialist countries and in Western 
Europe are cases in point. These same forces could not allow 
the U.S. to go in a direction that increases the 
government's responsibility to take care of its people. </p>

<p>Government sources say well over $100 billion would be saved 
by not having the insurance, drug, profit-making hospital 
chains, medical supply and equipment companies and finance 
capital involved. It doesn't matter how logical a 
government-run program might be, government funded people-
serving programs don't fit into the grand scheme of 
international capital. Because of the drastic results it 
brings, privatization is now being rejected here in the U.S. 
and throughout the world. </p>

<p> While privatization brings profits to corporations, it 
leaves a steady stream of death and dying in its path. This 
is not being lost on those in the line of fire.</p>

 <h4>Remember the AMA</h4>

 <p>A word must be said about the American Medical Association 
and other segments of organized medicine. Remember when they 
were the power brokers in national health policy? Now they 
are relegated to a "pawn in the game" status. When the 
health industry monopolies say its time to cry about "free 
choice of physician" and "quality of health care," they hold 
a press conference. The AMA is caught in a contradiction. 
Single-payer legislation would maintain the free choice of 
doctors like in Canada, while the Clinton and Republican 
plans would put physicians under the control of the 
insurance carriers and other profiteers. </p>

 <p>Because the Democratic Party betrayed its campaign 
promises, the November elections brought more Republicans 
into office. The Clinton administration has failed to 
deliver on any substantive campaign promise, especially to 
labor and community forces.</p>

<p> The mass media will report that this more right-of-center 
Congress will mean death to any health care reform. That 
need not be the case. On the contrary, the failure of the 
for-profit industry to win their victory in 1994 will give 
single-payer advocates energy to continue the struggle. Our 
side must increase the stakes by broadening the legislative 
health agenda. After all, the crisis in health care has 
increased, so the solutions need to be more far reaching.</p>

<p> Since immunization and other preventive programs will 
continue to be cut, infectious diseases will escalate. 
Pneumonia, measles, sexually transmitted diseases (gonorrhea 
and syphilis) and AIDs will intensify at a dramatic rate. 
This is already happening.</p>

<p> Infant mortality and longevity rates will worsen. Cancers 
that are confinable through early detection programs will 
increase. </p>

 <p>In each of these instances, the anti-working-class and 
racist edge will be more apparent than ever before, with 
racially and nationally oppressed and rural people bearing 
the brunt of the attack. The sharp distinctions in the two-
class system of health care that is growing in the U.S. will 
further widen.</p>

<p> We must get back to putting the health and welfare of 
people above profits. The popular slogan, "health care is a 
human right" will lead us in the next period. Its simple 
message will reach millions of people. That means the 
funding of public hospitals and community health centers is 
a top priority. Recruiting people-orientated physicians 
under strictly observed affirmative action guidelines, to 
work as salaried doctors to provide medical care is a 
realizable goal. Public health service physicians have done 
that in the past and they can, with proper funding, do it in 
the future. Nurses, social workers and other health care 
workers need to be recruited into health care in the same 
manner. The communities who suffer the most must be the 
venue of this recruitment drive. They are also far more 
interested in community service and not using their medical 
degrees to reach mega-buck life styles.</p>

<p> The agenda for the next phase of health reform must be 
expanded to fit the needs of the people's health, not the 
financial statements of the health monopolies. For example, 
guaranteeing full prevention services and long-term care is 
desperately needed. Also, every person in the U.S. must be 
covered, not just the 85 to 95 percent being talked about. 
In Canada, they refer to all patients being covered, not 
citizens. Given the large number of immigrants, with or 
without papers, the U.S. needs the same approach.</p>

<p>Highlighting these elements will increase the value of the 
already active seniors movement and bring millions of 
immigrants into the struggle.</p>

<p> To defeat the health monopolies will require this kind of 
mass, people's movement. The single-payer movement is an 
excellent starting point from which to build a broader 
movement. Involving organizations like Jobs With Justice is 
an example of how this movement can be broadened.</p>

 <p>It is never too late to increase our demands. At the same 
time, Congress must be pressured to hold the widest possible 
hearings into the monopolization of the health industry. 
Congressional hearings must also investigate the massive 
financial contributions monopoly gave to members of 
Congress. This legalized extortion must be revealed for its 
anti-democratic goals. This kind of congressional action can 
be part of a one-two punch strategy to knockout the 
monopolies.</p>

 <p>A big word of caution on moving toward a state-by-state 
solution. This has been seen as a fallback position by 
activists. State-plan advocates point to Canada as an 
example for the U.S. However, Canada has just 7 provinces, 
not 50 states. There are entirely different histories 
associated with these national divisions. The current 
monopolization of the industry precludes a state-based 
solution, even for tactical reasons. Once states with strong 
unions take this action, states where labor is weak would 
never see these benefits. The experience of Medicaid in 
different parts of the country is a case in point. The 
monopolies will play one state against the other, just as 
they do with labor organizing.</p>

<p> When the New York Times, on September 30th, devotes a 
front-page story to the California referendum on single-
payer - after the death of the national reform effort - it 
should give cause to worry about this direction. This does 
not, however, diminish the value of state and local 
referenda to dramatize the crisis in health care and the 
need for national reform. On the contrary, these kinds of 
local actions make perfect tactical and strategic sense.</p>

 <p>Any labor negotiator knows that you never end up with what 
you start out with and if you start out with a basic 
compromise, the final result will be less. Even if we are to 
end up with the single-payer compromise, let's increase the 
stakes now and negotiate from a higher vantage point. The 
last round showed that by starting out with the single-payer 
public/private mix, with some profit monopolies in key 
positions, we almost ended up with a total disaster. Let's 
not repeat that mistake.</p>

<p> Mass actions must be increased so that the sentiments of 
the people can be heard. Rallies in Washington D.C. and at 
home will be necessary. Direct actions at the offices of 
politicians and in the offices of corporate America must be 
increased. Referendums, petitions and similar mass actions 
need to be stepped up. The mass-struggle experiences of the 
last two years will be invaluable as we head toward the next 
period. A people's health movement, more successful than 
ever, can emerge from these struggles. </p><br>
