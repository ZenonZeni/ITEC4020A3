Currently, the only federal funding earmarked for gifted education is available through application to the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Education Act of 1992.  The Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program is designed to build nationwide capability in gifted and talented education and encourage rich and challenging curricula for all children.  Funding that is not earmarked for gifted education may be used to benefit gifted students.  Examples include Goals 2000 and some technology funds such as Challenge grants.  <P>

To obtain written information on the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented 
Students Education Program [OERI], or to request a list of projects that are 
currently funded, contact Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program, U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, 555 New Jersey Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20208-5645.

This fact sheet summarizes issues involved in the reauthorization of the 
Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 1988, Title IV-B, 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  This Act provides grants for research 
and demonstration projects and training activities to meet the needs of gifted 
and talented students.  The Javits program has served over 2 million gifted and 
talented students through 75 discretionary projects and also funds the National 
Center for Research and Development in the Education of Gifted and Talented 
Children and Youth.  A Federal government report is cited indicating that only 
two cents of every $100 spent on K-12 education in 1990 supported special 
opportunities for gifted students, and recommending that the definition of 
"gifted" be broadened and that effective programs be expanded into regular 
school programs.  Specific reauthorization issues addressed include: whether to 
focus on equal education or on excellence for the few; reauthorization of the 
National Center for Gifted Research; and continuation of discretionary grants 
for model projects serving only gifted and talented students.  Specific 
appropriation figures for fiscal years 1989 through 1995 (proposed) are listed.

This directory resulted from a 1991 survey of 46 programs funded under the 
Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 1988.  The 
projects are listed alphabetically by state, city, and name of project.  
Projects have been divided into two types: (1) those that provide direct 
services to children and (2) dissemination projects.  Projects in each of these 
types are summarized in a matrix display listing state, grantee, name of 
program, type of district, age/grade, and target population characteristics.  A 
discussion of the Javits Act covering purpose, eligibility, types of projects 
funded, and source of further information is also provided.  Individual project 
descriptions comprise most of the document and contain sections providing (1) 
general information, (2) program description, (3) program implementation, and 
(4) program evaluation.  Among information provided for most projects is the 
following: project director, address, funding period, telephone, goals of 
program, program description, type of district, target population, selection 
criteria, identification procedures, number of children served, number of 
people involved in program implementation, type of preservice or inservice 
training, key conditions for replicating the program, cost of replicating the 
program, availability of technical assistance, most effective features of 
program, most surprising or challenging features of program, planned followup 
activities, and evaluation plan.  A final section lists project directors, 
locations, and telephone numbers.  (DB)<BR>
