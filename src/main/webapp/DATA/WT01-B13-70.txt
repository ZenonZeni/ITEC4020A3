Like the courageous matador, the value investor stands firm in the face of lowered expectations surrounding a stock.
<P>
<B>Value represents a contrarian style,</B> finding beautiful swans where the rest of the market sees ugly ducklings. It pursues the downtrodden and overlooked -- stocks of viable companies that are currently out-of-favor and on sale at bargain prices.
<P>
"We look for stocks that are unloved for the wrong reason," says David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Advisors and a leading champion of value investing. "We believe there will be enough positive earnings surprises or opinion changes, so that these companies will outperform the market over time." Regarded as a pioneer among contrarians, Mr. Dreman currently manages the <A HREF="../../funds/high_return.html">Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund</A>, ranked by Lipper as the number one mutual fund in the equity-income category over the one-year, five-year, and life-of-fund time periods as of 9/30/96.*  (One yr. - 1/147; five yr. - 1/57; life - 1/37)

* Based upon changes in class A shares net asset value with dividends reinvested and without sales charges which, if included, may have resulted in less favorable results. Inception date of 3/18/88. Past performance does not represent future performance.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd1.gif" ALT="Sidestepping Investor Fears"><BR>
In the topsy-turvy arena of investing, value disciples count on one predictable outcome: investor over-reaction to bad news, which inevitably sends short-term stock prices tumbling to levels much lower than their earnings would suggest. Bad news can come in many forms -- a disappointing earnings quarter, concerns over the economy in general, disturbing news out of the White House.
<P>
Investors were seeing red, for example, during the 1993 debate over health care reform. Health care stocks nosedived, and value investors picked up some quality companies usually found only in the growth sector. Since then, talk of revamping the medical system has quieted, while many of those health care stocks have rebounded nicely.
<P>
What does a Kemper-Dreman value stock look like? <B>Its most distinguishing characteristic is a low price-to-earnings ratio,</B> the holy grail pursued by most value investors. In addition to a small price tag, however, value stocks must show signs of financial strength, along with above-average dividend yields and historical growth of earnings and dividends -- qualities found today in companies such as Fannie Mae, Banc One, and Philip Morris.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd2.gif" ALT="The Discipline To Stand Your Ground"><BR>
Value investing appeals to the bargain hunter in all of us. It's the same force that compels us to buy our swimwear and lawn furniture in the dead of winter.
<P>
But value also attracts the patient and disciplined investor. It takes time for out-of-favor companies to achieve the turnaround that value investors bank on. And it takes discipline to follow the strict principles of the Kemper-Dreman strategy, which means <B>selling stocks when P/E ratios approach the market average,</B> regardless of how favorable their prospects appear.
<P>
While some critics maintain that value is a riskier proposition, supporters maintain just the opposite. The stock's prices and expectations are already low, they argue, so additional downturns can't do much damage. "Put it this way. You will probably get hurt worse falling from a high ladder than from a small step stool," observes Mr. Dreman.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd3.gif" ALT="The Finesse And Confidence Of The Contrarian"><BR>
Many recent academic studies suggest that contrarians may be onto something with their strategy of pursuing stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios.

Mr. Dreman has devoted his life's work to studying the performance of low-priced stocks. His much-published analysis of 1,500 large companies has shown that low P/E stocks outperformed high P/Es over a 20-year period (see chart at right). In fact, the cheapest stocks in the study topped the market average for annual returns by a margin of 17.2% to 14.7%. The most expensive stocks, on the other hand, posted average annual returns of just 11.2%.
<P>
Mr. Dreman's research looks at total return, including both appreciation and dividends. Because value stocks pay higher-than-average dividends, they tend to weather down markets better than growth stocks. When times are tough, it's often those dividend returns that help to prop up stock prices and provide a measure of capital protection.

<P>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/value_subhd4.gif" ALT="A Variety Of Value Opportunities"><BR>
Other research shows that low-priced stocks performed better than big-ticket stocks among companies of all sizes. As a result, the Kemper-Dreman team has applied their contrarian school of thought to their entire line of value portfolios.
<P>
The <A HREF="../../funds/contrarian.html">Kemper-Dreman Contrarian Fund</A>, for example, pursues large cap companies such as General Electric and Mobil. At the other end of the spectrum, the Kemper-Dreman Small Cap Value Fund consists of smaller companies, like Bally Entertainment. And the Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund focuses mostly on larger companies, which currently include Amoco and Humana. As noted earlier, portfolio composition and holdings are subject to change.

Source: Towers Data Systems. The hypothetical $10,000 investment is from 3/18/88 to 9/30/96. This investment and the average annual returns above reflect reinvestment of all dividends and adjustment for the maximum sales charge of 5.75%. Returns are historical and do not represent future performance. Returns and net asset value fluctuate. Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less than original cost. All performance is for class A shares. The Fund offers different classes of shares. Performance of other classes will vary from that shown because of differences in sales charges and fees paid by shareholders investing in different share classes. The sector concentration strategy of the Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund presents greater risk than a more diversified fund. The S&amp;P 500 is an unmanaged index generally representative of the U.S. stock market.
