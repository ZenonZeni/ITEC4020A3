<H2>How to Make the Right Connections and</H2>
<H2>Find a Reputable Computer Reseller</H2></CENTER>

<STRONG>The Expectations....</STRONG><BR><BR>
Consumers — whether in a home office or a small business — need to choose 
their resellers wisely if they wish to purchase a computer system that 
will serve them now and be capable of serving them in the near future.
<BR><BR>
If you are in the market to buy a desktop or personal computer for your 
business, it is important that you find a reputable reseller to meet 
your needs.  You should first establish what it is you want the reseller 
to do for you, and then shop for the reseller who can best meet those 
requirements.<BR><BR>
It may be useful to create a list of "expectations" you have for the 
reseller you are considering. For example, will you need training, 
service and support assistance?  If so, then you need to consider a 
reseller who can guarantee that assistance. What kind of warranty 
service will you require?  Determine what warranty service is available 
from the reseller you are considering, as well as what service will be 
available after the warranty expires. How important is price? If it 
is a very important consideration, then you may have to eliminate service 
from your expectations list to lower the cost. Once you have completed 
your list, you should have a better idea of the reseller who may be right 
for you.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>What is a computer reseller?</STRONG><BR><BR>
Like computers, there are different types of computer resellers. 
The computer reseller from which you purchase your computer, peripherals 
and software may be known by a variety of labels, including: dealer, 
VAD (value added dealer), VAR (value added reseller), systems integrator, 
computer superstore, and retailer. One type may suit your needs better 
than another, since the service and support for your computer system and 
its components may vary from reseller to reseller.<BR><BR>
Due to the rapid pace of change in the computer industry, most reseller 
organizations tend to be a blend of several of the types listed below:<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Systems Integrators</STRONG> (SIs) provide the highest level of integration support and 
service. They understand what terms such as technical assessments, 
requirement analysis, and data modeling mean, and have the resources 
to integrate different types of computer environments. They generally do not resell 
hardware. If they do, they only deal with hardware components for 
very large accounts.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Network Systems Integrators</STRONG> (NSIs) usually provide hardware 
integration products and services — frequently across multiple platforms such 
as DOS, Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, without applications support.<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Network Consulting Organizations</STRONG> fit in between SIs and NSIs. 
They generally do not resell products, but provide consulting services 
such as network design, product testing, and system requirements analysis. 
These kinds of companies usually do not get involved with applications 
development, but can provide a high level of impartial information.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Value-Added Resellers</STRONG> (VARs) usually provide a large variety 
of products with a certain level of support to their customers. They often 
serve as the defacto "systems integrator" for small businesses.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Value-Added Dealers</STRONG> (VADs) resell hardware, software and peripherals, 
and also provide a minimum level of telephone or on-site support.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Retailers and Computer Superstores</STRONG> are organizations that sell 
computers and computer-related products in stores.<BR><BR>
<STRONG>Mail Order Companies</STRONG> sell computer systems, software and components 
through catalogs.<BR><HR>

<CENTER><H2>Selecting a Reseller</H2></CENTER>
There are a myriad of resellers from which to choose, ranging from 
mega-stores carrying dozens of brands of computer hardware and software, 
to smaller dealers that carry only one or two brands. <BR><BR>
When shopping for a reseller be sure to obtain the salesperson's name 
and make note of the date that you talked to this person, in case there 
is a difference in the equipment and service that you actually received 
from the reseller and what you expected to receive. Most resellers are 
willing to listen to meaningful complaints and address them directly to 
your satisfaction. Being able to articulate what you expected to 
receive from the reseller, and when, may help you in getting a 
satisfactory resolution of your claim.<BR><BR>
<BR>
Following is a "checklist" to help you in selecting a reputable reseller:<MENU>
<LI> Longevity in the Marketplace. If a reseller is well-established 
in the business community, it is more likely that the company will be around to handle your future questions, service needs, and upgrade plans.  Ask how long the company has been in business.	•  Reference Checks.  Can the reseller provide a list of satisfied customer references?  Contact your local Better Business Bureau for a reliability report on the company.
<BR><LI> Quality of Service. Do the firm's stated marketing mottoes match the services they actually provide?  Matching the reseller's specialties to your business needs is important in developing a good working relationship.  For example, all companies specializing in local area network-related services are not the same.  Will you require a lot of assistance and support or a little?  Look for pre-sales support (consulting), implementation (installation) support, and after-sales support.
Be sure that you can obtain service for the software and hardware equipment you are purchasing both when it is under warranty and when the warranty expires.
Remember, some companies, like superstores, concentrate on sales volume, while others focus on being service providers.  Be aware of the differences and the consequences.
<BR><LI> Manufacturer Authorizations.  Has the reseller installed and/or does it use the specific kinds of equipment that are being proposed to you?  Does the reseller have training on the equipment being proposed?  Does the VAR/SI have specific vendor authorizations, certifications or designations?  Remember that certifications and/or authorizations are merely one of many indicators of capability when selecting a reseller to meet your needs.  Before authorizing resellers to distribute their products, major manufacturers have generally checked the reseller out and the authorization medallions are a sign of confidence in the reseller.  Resellers have dealer numbers authorizing them to sell specific products.  If you do not see decals or certificates for these vendor authorizations, certifications or designations being displayed, ask the reseller.
<BR><LI> Certification. A reseller who has certified computer service technicians on staff is showing his/her commitment to computer service quality. A+ Certification is a widely-recognized identification that is received from the Computing Technology Industry  Association (CompTIA) after successfully passing a comprehensive testing battery that covers configuring, installing, diagnosing, repairing, upgrading, and maintaining microcomputers and associated technologies, as well as interaction with customers and safety practices.
<BR><LI> Support Questions.  How much of the system being configured do you want the reseller to support?  Can they support this platform with in-house personnel or by outsourcing?  If outsourcing, what is the reseller's relationship to the outside source?  What is your recourse if there is a problem with the part of the system or network being outsourced?
In the area of technical support, it is important to remember there is no such thing as "free" technical support.  Technical support is invariably tied into the cost of the computer.  Therefore, computer experts agree, if you are choosing a reseller on price alone, be aware that the trade-off may likely be reduced service.•  Level of Rapport.  What will be the rapport level between the reseller's support personnel and the employees in your organization who will be dealing with each other?  An adversarial posture can cause problems within your company.   What kind of operator training will be available for your staff, and at what cost?
<BR><LI> Service. Does the reseller service equipment in-house or do they send it out?  Does the reseller come to you or must you take the computer in?
<BR><LI> Training. Can the reseller train you on the equipment or software on their premises?  Or do they contract with an independent training facility?
<BR><LI> Resources. Can the reseller commit the resources necessary to bring about the proposed solution in the time frame agreed upon?
<BR><LI> Extended manufacturer warranties. Many warranties are only for a one year period?  Can the reseller extend them?
<BR><LI> Outside Help. Can the reseller bring in vendor resources if necessary to complete the projects in the same timely fashion?
<BR><LI> Industry Commitment. Does the reseller actively participate in computer technology societies or associations, demonstrating the company's familiarity with developments in the computing and information technologies community at large? Look for evidence of participation and membership in computer industry organizations in the form of prominently displayed certificates, plaques and/or decals.</MENU>

<CENTER><H2>Establishing A Relationship</H2></CENTER>
The computer you buy today will be replaced by a smaller, faster one tomorrow.  However, it does not necessarily mean your computer has to be replaced.  By establishing a relationship with your reseller, you can be assured the firm will help you select a computer that has the functionality you need so that the equipment can easily be updated in the future.
Be aware that buying the most up-to-date computer today is not the same as buying a computer with the functionality you may need for the future.  A reputable reseller can foresee future problems and help you choose the system that will serve you best now and in the years to come.<BR><BR>

When selecting or evaluating a computer reseller, remember to consider the following factors:<MENU>
<LI> service levels and quality
<BR><LI> technical expertise in advanced technology
<BR><LI> knowledge of application or network operating system software
<BR><LI>  depth of after-sale support</MENU>

Searching for help to solve your computing and information technology 
problems can be both expensive and time consuming. Computer technology 
associations can be instrumental in finding technically competent and 
savvy computer reseller professionals who can provide solutions to 
your specific information system and integration problems. For more 
information on selecting a computer reseller or for a list of 
A+ Authorized Service Centers near you, call the Computing Technology 
Industry Association at (708) 268-1818, ext. 301, or fax your request 
to (708) 268-1384. Contact your local Better Business Bureau to check 
on the reputability of a reseller that you are considering.<BR>
