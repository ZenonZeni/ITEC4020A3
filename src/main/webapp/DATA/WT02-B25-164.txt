<H3>Opening Doors: The Federal Response To Date  1995-1996</H3>

<HR>
<P>In the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, the Congress and HUD attempted to create some protections for people with disabilities on PHA waiting lists through the PHA Allocation Plan process.  The Allocation Plan was designed to measure the impact that designating "elderly only" housing would have on people with disabilities and to identify alternative resources.  With enactment of the Housing Opportunities Program Extension Act of 1996, the protections for people with disabilities provided within the PHA Allocation Plan process have been virtually eliminated, increasing the likelihood that PHAs will designate housing without ensuring that adequate replacement resources are available.  

<P> As Congress and HUD moved towards this legislation in the fall of 1995, the housing rights of people with disabilities were completely ignored in the interest of expediting "elderly only" designated housing policies.  For example, the first draft of the Senate's version of public housing reform legislation (S. 1260) would have permitted the forced relocation of all people with disabilities under age 62 who were living  in public elderly housing, and who were in compliance with their lease, solely because they were disabled.  This draft was supported by HUD in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in September of 1995.  Under the original provisions of the bill,  these about-to-be-displaced lease-compliant public housing tenants were also to be denied the protections provided in the Uniform Relocation Act.  

<P>S. 1260 represented the first time in the history of the Housing Act of 1937 that the federal government, absent the need to demolish or rehabilitate housing, was willing to forcibly relocate people from their federally subsidized homes and suspend their entitlement to lawful benefits.  

<P>It is significant that senior HUD officials did not even mention this forced relocation provision in their testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on S. 1260 given on September 28, 1995.  Rather, they indicated HUD's support for the provisions of the bill which addressed designated housing, which was echoed by all of the PHA officials who testified at the hearing.

<P>It remained the responsibility of the CCD Housing Task Force witness, whose testimony came at the very end of the Senate hearing, to point out the irreparable harm that would be caused to people with disabilities if the bill was enacted as drafted.  Once again, the CCD Housing Task Force was the lone advocate for over 112,000 people with disabilities who could have been forced by the federal government to leave their homes solely because they belong to an identified and stigmatized population group.

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force would like to believe that the discriminatory and stigmatizing provisions of the original version of S. 1260 represented the low point in the move to exclude or limit federal housing opportunities for people with disabilities.  The original draft of S. 1260 was an example of how, when inflamed rhetoric rather than good public policy dominates the debate, vulnerable populations can be threatened with irreparable harm.

<P>Other specific examples of the lack of an effective federal housing policy to address the needs of people with disabilities include:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>HUD's continued reliance on a single program (Section 811 Supportive Housing Program for Persons With Disabilities) to meet the housing needs of all  people with disabilities, despite published literature regarding the housing preferences of people with disabilities which demonstrates that they prefer a full range of housing options and to live in non-stigmatizing, integrated, and inclusionary housing. 
<P>
<LI>The disproportionate share of funding which is allocated to elderly housing, rather than housing for people with disabilities.  The FY 1996 HUD budget appropriated by Congress  allocated more than 77% of Section 202/811 funding to the Section 202 Supportive Housing Program for the Elderly and only 23% to the Section 811 Supportive Housing Program for People with Disabilities.  HUD's FY 1997 budget request includes the same inequitable distribution.  This allocation request was made despite the fact that housing for low income elderly households is increasing due to designated housing policies and despite the documented worst case housing needs of people with disabilities.
<P>
<LI>The lack of any effort on HUD's part to document the housing needs of people with disabilities in a 1995 report to the Congress which was required under Section 661 of Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.  HUD's report was poorly conceptualized, poorly prepared, and demonstrated a complete lack of effort on HUD's part to comply with a Congressional mandate to study the extent to which federal housing programs serve people with disabilities in relation to their housing needs.
</UL>
<P>It is time for the Congress and for HUD to confront the negative impact that the "elderly only" designated housing debate has had, and will continue to have, on the quality of life for low-income people with disabilities.  Steps must be taken immediately to:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Address the loss of resources caused by designation.<P>
<LI>Obtain accurate estimates of unmet and worst case housing needs of people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Eradicate the ignorance, stigma, and discrimination which has characterized the "elderly only" housing debates.<P>
<LI>Develop more enlightened and balanced federal housing policies so that people with disabilities receive their fair share of all new federal housing resources based on their documented housing needs.
</OL>
