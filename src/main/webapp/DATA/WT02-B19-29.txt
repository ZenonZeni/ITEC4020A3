This is my desk<BR>
Yes, it is always that messy
<P>
The machine with all of the postit notes and Kinder Surprise toys stuck
to its monitor is
<A HREF=http://marvin.eng.usyd.edu.au/Welcome>marvin</A>.
To its left, under the telephone is netserv. Between them, you can
see my <A HREF=http://marvin.eng.usyd.edu.au/~bernardg/newt.gif>Newton</A>
(It's the flat black thing on top of the paper).
Below netserv, you can see a stack of two Mac Pluses, with a Mac Plus
keyboard balanced on top.
<P>
In the bottom left corner, you can just see the case of the fileserver for the
lab.

<P>
This is the view out one of the windows here. Note the lovely palm tree, swaying in the wind.
<P>
This image is a view from roughly the same spot as the shot above, only
looking to the right. If you were to turn around and look behind you, you'd
be looking into <A HREF=lab.colour>the lab</A>.
