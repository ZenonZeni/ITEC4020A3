<H1>The climate policy<BR>
of the European Community</H1>
<HR>
<B>The environmental policy of the European Community (EC) has addressed 
climate change since the mid-1980s. </B> Between 1986 and 1989, several non-binding 
resolutions adopted by the Parliament and Council of the EC called for measures to 
combat climate change.1  In addition, a number of binding Directives on air pollution 
addressed the issue indirectly.2  The EC's Climate Change Policy of 1990,3 subsequently 
endorsed by the EFTA states,4 committed member states to stabilising carbon dioxide 
emissions at 1990 levels "in general" by the year 2000.  According to the policy document, 
this target is only a first step, with <I>reducing</I> emissions to be considered at a later 
stage.  The policy document also contains suggestions on how to achieve the target.<P>
<B>The EC and its members signed <A HREF = 
"fs250.html">the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
Change</A> in June 1992 at the Rio "Earth Summit".</B>  On 23 April 1993, the 
EC Council decided that it would ratify the Convention by the end of the year.  During <A 
HREF = "fs209.html">the negotiations for the Convention</A>, 
the Commission of the EC and the 12 member states had played a leading role.  They had 
advocated the adoption of strong measures, in particular the incorporation of the EC 
emissions target, into the Convention.  Although supported by a number of states, this 
stabilisation target was eventually replaced by a compromise formula.<P>
<B>The EC has declared its intention to continue playing a lead role in the 
international effort to combat climate change.  </B>As a block of leading industrial 
states, the EC intends to adopt measures that go beyond the obligations imposed on 
developed countries by the Climate Convention. The focus of current EC initiatives is 
therefore on stabilising and eventually reducing CO2 emissions.  The 5th Environmental 
Action Programme adopted in March 1992 sets objectives and targets for the year 2000.5  
In addition, the EC Commission started work in 1990 on a comprehensive Community 
strategy for limiting carbon dioxide emissions and improving energy efficiency.  The 
proposed strategy, submitted to the Council in May 1992,6 is based on the premise that 
reducing energy demand by increasing energy efficiency and promoting fuel-switching is 
the best way to reduce CO2 emissions.  It proposes a wide range of specific measures, 
which are to be based on the principles of economic efficiency, equity, and subsidiarity.  
The strategy is currently under discussion.<P>
<B>The proposed EC strategy for limiting CO2 emissions incorporates existing 
actions and initiatives for promoting energy efficiency</B>. In October 1991, the EC 
Council approved a five-year energy efficiency programme called SAVE (Specific Actions 
for Vigorous Energy Efficiency).  The proposed ALTENER Programme would promote 
the development of renewable energy sources.  In April  1993, the EC Council decided to 
set up a system for monitoring the Community's CO2 emissions.  Other programmes 
related to research and development in the field of energy efficiency are also under 
discussion.<P>
<B>The most controversial measure under discussion is the introduction of a <A 
HREF = "fs230.html">carbon tax</A></B>.  In June 1992, 
the Commission proposed a Council Directive for taxing carbon dioxide emissions and 
energy.7  The proposal calls for member states to levy taxes at the national level on the 
consumption of energy from non-renewable sources.  The tax would be based on the 
energy source's CO2 content and energy value (measured in calories).  The rate would 
start at US$3 per barrel of oil or its equivalent in 1993 and increase by $1 per barrel every 
year.  There is still considerable debate over this measure.<P>
<B>The EC is also a party to earlier international agreements that have a bearing 
on climate change. </B> As a party to <A HREF = 
"fs224.html">the Montreal Protocol</A>, which controls the 
use of <A HREF = "fs031.html">CFCs</A>, it was among the 
first to advocate stricter measures than those originally imposed by the Protocol.  The EC 
is also a party to <A HREF = "fs225.html">the Geneva 
Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution</A> and its protocols. It has 
adopted implementing legislation in the areas addressed by these various legal instruments.  
Work is underway on a draft Directive on volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are 
the subject of the 1991 protocol to the Geneva Convention (fact sheet 225).<P>
