Managed Care &amp; Budget Cutbacks<br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p>As promised at the voter registration drive in Pontiac, I have
been looking for information regarding the effect of the new
Republican Congress' policies concerning Medicaid and managed
care and what that means for methadone patients. From what I have
been able to discover, it doesn't look good. The Republican
&quot;Contract [ON] America&quot; wants to &quot;cut federal
entitlements, and instead give block grants to the states.&quot;1<br>
<br>
Republicans say they want block grants instead of entitlements
for flexibility because they believe they &quot;would have more
discretion over the way the money is spent.&quot;2 This is not
terribly encouraging in Michigan with the governor we have, as we
all know Engler is not exactly concerned about the poor,
minorities, women, or addicts. The only reason any of these
groups have gotten any relief is because of federal
entitlements--with one of his first strokes of the pen, he did
away with many needed programs. <br>
<br>
One of the first federal cuts for addicts is from &quot;The House
Ways and Means Committee [since it] is removing substance abuse
as a disability under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
program. Just last year, Congress enacted a new law which limits
SSI payments for addicts and alcoholics to three years. Under
what the House is proposing for welfare reform, those on SSI
might be cut off altogether. Worse still, the committee has
decided that these people...would not only lose their SSI, but
would become ineligible for Medicaid&quot;3 If addicts are cut
from Medicaid, it will be suicide, especially for those who
depend upon it to pay for their methadone maintenance. <br>
<br>
We are so concerned with saving money and cutting the federal
budget that it is absolutely illogical (and downright stupid) to
cut addicts off from the one thing that keeps many of them out of
prison. It costs about $2,600 per year to maintain an addict on
methadone, and it costs ten times that much to &quot;treat&quot;
addiction by throwing the addict in prison. When addicts cannot
afford methadone treatment, there is always the threat of a
return to the streets where an addict can easily be 100 times the
drain on society when s/he has to return to larceny and burglary
to maintain their habit.<br>
<br>
The question is, &quot;How can the addict afford the price on the
street if s/he can't afford the methadone clinic?&quot; When the
addict is maintained on methadone, s/he is usually making
improvements in their life--getting an education, working to
support self and family, and improving relationships. The addict
has neither the time or inclination to engage in negative
behaviors such as larceny, burglary, or any number of other
things the addict has to do just to &quot;maintain&quot; on the
street. The addict maintained on methadone is not exposing
him/herself to AIDS on a regular basis as they were when
exchanging needles. The price of one case of AIDS in money alone
is a thousand times the cost of yearly methadone maintenance, not
to mention the human misery. In plain language, when the physical
and/or psychological addiction is taken care of, the addict is
just like any other person who wants to improve his life
conditions. As we all know, when the addict is on the street,
nothing matters except the next fix.<br>
<br>
What is <b><i>really</i></b> idiotic is the price of methadone
maintenance in the first place. It doesn't have to cost $2,600
per year; the reason it does is because of the governmental
regulations on it. According to Substance Abuse Report
Newsletter: <br>
<br>
Methadone regulations are too restrictive and should be relaxed
in favor of clinically useful guidelines, according to a report
by the Institute of Medicine [IOM]. While stopping short of
recommending abolishing the regulations altogether, the report,
released December 21, calls for making methadone easier to use
for treatment facilities and patients alike.4<br>
<br>
When regulations call for arbitrary rules and regulations from
somewhere in the great beyond that has nothing to do with real
life and real people, costs rise. The doctor, counselor, and
addict are in the best position to know how to treat the
addiction--not some senator in Washington or Lansing and not some
program director who doesn't know us and probably never will.<br>
<br>
As far as Medicaid managed care, budget cutbacks will definitely
be pushing for more of it. &quot;Managed behavioral health care
organizations contract with HMOs or states to provide Medicaid
services. They then turn to their provider panels for
cost-effective care.&quot;5 The definition of managed care is:<br>
<br>
a system used by groups (including insurance carriers and
corporations) to manage costs while maintaining quality of health
and medical services. Specific approaches used by the payer of
services include: pre-certification, utilization review, case
management and medical necessity review.6<br>
<br>
The idea behind managed care is to save money by having a primary
provider decide what type of health care you will be allowed
under the system. The primary provider decides if you need
methadone treatment, so the bottom line is, before you sign up
for anything, find out how your primary provider feels about
methadone maintenance or any other treatment you now receive on a
regular basis. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Reporter"><b>Reporter</b></a><b> Skews
Ritalin Story<br>
by Jon</b> </p>

<p align="center">On November 16 and 17, WXYZ, Channel 7 in
Detroit, aired a two-part series on Ritalin, a drug commonly
prescribed to children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD), Ritalin has long been known as one of the most
effective treatments for the disease. It has been under recent
scrutiny due to efforts to ease restrictions on the drug in
Michigan and elsewhere. Proponents of the drug's therapeutic use
believe that its current Schedule II status makes Ritalin
unnecessarily difficult for ADHD patients to obtain. Some believe
that relaxed regulation of Ritalin will encourage abuse.<br>
<br>
Ritalin has been abused for more than twenty years by adolescents
and adults. Ritalin's rise in popularity in Michigan may be due
in part to the state's strict laws which prohibit most
amphetamines. Ritalin is a stimulant but not technically an
amphetamine. When prescribed properly, Ritalin is not used as an
amphetamine substitute. There is no evidence to suggest that
Ritalin is abused any more than other drugs with abuse potential.
Yet, Channel 7's report implies that Ritalin abuse is rampant.
Reporter Shellee Smith proclaimed that &quot;Michigan is quickly
becoming one of the Ritalin Capitols of the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smith's sensationalistic rantings can do nothing to prevent
Ritalin abuse. The heavily biased report focused largely on the
negative ramifications of Ritalin abuse but said little of the
therapeutic aspects of the drug and the thousands of children and
adults who benefit from its use. Ritalin patients are stigmatized
due to the atmosphere of ignorance that surrounds mental illness
and drug therapies. Deceiving the public with overblown,
misleading information about any public health issue is
dangerous. Smith's report may potentially spread panic among the
families of Ritalin patients who have suffered the hardships of
coping with their loved one's ADHD. Shellee Smith seems to be
using sensationalistic tactics to sell her report under the guise
of protecting the public from the &quot;evils&quot; of Ritalin.
Who will protect the public from Shellee Smith's recklessness?<br>
<br>
As with any psychoactive substance, Ritalin has abuse potential.
Smith drew the focus away from more significant aspects of the
issue in order to exaggerate this point while employing scare
tactics that would appeal to any parent's worst fears. Ritalin
abuse among adolescents and adults does exist in Michigan and
elsewhere. All drug problems are serious, especially when
children and adolescents are affected. But Smith falls far short
of proving a Ritalin epidemic in Michigan. Her report provided
little hard data and instead relied on a number of adolescents
from an area treatment center who appeared to be singled out
because of their Ritalin dependencies. The appearance of an
epidemic can be easily created if one uses a sample group of
hand-picked subjects possessing only those characteristics that
support one side of the issue. This brand of yellow journalism is
nothing new to Shellee Smith. Earlier this year, she did a
similar report on methadone. The story was shamelessly slanted by
employing amateurish editing techniques and other instruments of
deception such as the use of half truths and distortion of facts.
She referred to methadone patients as addicts who &quot;line up
to get their fix&quot; at the methadone clinic. Channel 7
videotaped patients inside clinics and, in some cases, allowed
their faces to be shown. Smith ignored any positive, therapeutic
qualities of methadone treatment while implying that addicts were
supporting their habits with hard-earned tax dollars.<br>
<br>
The report seemed to imply that all methadone patients were inner
city welfare cheats getting high for free. Meanwhile, thousands
of methadone patients within Channel 7's viewing area were left
to explain to their families that they were not patrons of legal
dope houses. Targeting methadone patients is a cheap way to
revive plummeting ratings which, ironically, are the result of
the station's abandonment of its star anchorman who was at the
time receiving treatment for his own addiction. Smith obviously
did little or no research on Ritalin or methadone. Her source for
these hatchet jobs is the worst kept secret in Detroit T.V. news.
It appears that she has been relying on her federal significant
other for information instead of doing hard investigative
reporting. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Methaphobia"><b>Methaphobia</b></a><b><br>
by Ira Sobel</b> </p>

<p align="center">We are living in a day and age when 12-step
programs are known everywhere as a successful institution for so
many people. Alcoholics Anonymous began with two individuals and
it has become the most effective tool used by people in recovery
afflicted with the disease of addiction. People are joining
12-step programs every day by the number. Lost souls are coming
into the rooms on our hands and knees defeated by our sickness.<br>
<br>
For 60 years the goal of Alcoholics Anonymous has been &quot;to
stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.&quot;
That quote is taken from the preamble that is read before most
meetings. Each 12-step program is based on that one statement. It
means that you are in these rooms to get sober for yourself and
to help others all you can to achieve sobriety. <b><i>No addict
should be turned away who asks for help</i></b>. This is an
integral part of AA and every other fellowship.<br>
<br>
In a sense, the preamble welcomes newcomers to the program, a
program where addicts think more about helping others than
satisfying their own wants and needs. It is a selfless program, a
place where an addict can feel safe. It gives the newcomer a
sense of belonging, that he or she has somewhere to go for help.
People go to meetings just to be in the company of other addicts
so that they can get better.<br>
<br>
There is an underlying tension that exists between people that
belong to the Narcotics Anonymous fellowship and people in
recovery on methadone. People that attend NA meetings regularly
consider themselves in recovery and people on methadone programs
are not. Essentially this schism exists because those that attend
NA meetings refuse to accept people on methadone because they
feel we are not drug-free, that it would be the drug speaking.
Their policy is that no one can share if they took a
mood-altering drug in the last 24 hours. So the practice has been
to not let someone on methadone share or qualify. NA is wrong. <b><i>Methadone
maintenance is not mood altering if you take methadone as
prescribed</i></b>. I think they have an extreme case of
methaphobia!!!<br>
<br>
Methaphobia is a state of mind in which someone or a group
displays an intense fear and a bias against methadone patients
and methadone programs. It is very much like people in NA have
built-in forgetters. Those who espouse on NA principles put down
methadone as an institution. Basically, these people like to play
God, doctor, lawyer and pharmacist!!!<br>
<br>
We are all addicts and as long as I have a desire to stop using
drugs, I should be able to share my experience, strength and hope
with a room full of addicts in all phases of recovery!!! That's
because I'm in my phase of recovery. A person on methadone can be
going to a specific NA group for six months without being able to
share while another person, who comes intermittently and has one
day back, is allowed to share!!! If the time of the meeting is 4
p.m. and the person was using &quot;some time yesterday&quot;
then we have to count hours. I mean shit, is there some kind of
time table they use in NA!!! It's so petty that I have to
laugh!!! I mean shit, does the NA meeting list have this time
table written on it?? Ridiculous.<br>
<br>
I have my own story about how NA didn't accept me as part of the
group and how I learned about methaphobia the hard way. When I
was discharged from my last detox in early 1986, I began going to
meetings. At the time, any meeting whether it was a beginners
meeting, or a traditions meeting, or CA or DA was important to my
recovery. Meetings, meetings and more meetings. At the very
beginning, I chased recovery like I chased an opiate. I would go
to 2-3 meetings a day all over the city. I went to Cocaine
Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, and then I went to Narcotics
Anonymous meetings.<br>
<br>
One of the first things I learned at the beginning was to be
rigorously honest. So, I went to my first NA meeting that was
held at Water View Hospital. It was a &quot;big book&quot;
meeting. Since I felt it was my duty to come clean about my
detoxing off methadone, I told people I &quot;was down to 15
mgs.&quot; This was a mistake. I was unaware of the methadone
clause of NA. The concept of methaphobia was all new to me. To my
naive mind, I was doing the right thing. You know, it's about
being honest today, but because of NA, I found out that day that,
unfortunately, it's not about being stupid!!!<br>
<br>
Right there, that instant in time, before the meeting even
started, I was blackballed. I didn't even have a chance at
sharing. One girl said that I had a &quot;ticket in my back
pocket.&quot; I didn't find the compassion and understanding from
NA. It's too rigid. I do not go to NA meetings. If I can't share
and voice how I am doing in one fellowship, then I've gone to
other fellowships for the support I very much need.<br>
<br>
To this day, I still have a major resentment against NA. Now, I
don't propose a full boycott of NA meetings. What I do suggest is
that if people in recovery need a place to go, they should attend
other 12-step groups. I also hope that people like us on
methadone should attend MA meetings at your program and at other
programs. At MA meetings, we share so honestly about the heavy
odds against you and me. People at MA meetings display an intense
desire to get well. It's so exciting when people cheer for
someone that shares about their good fortune. There is an
intimacy that exists in MA meetings that I've never experienced
with other 12-step support groups. These meetings are so new and
refreshing. An MA meeting is not filled with aging people that
nod out. No, it's about people who want to get better. In
essence, I've let go of my resentment and I've learned not to
fight NA but to go to MA. That's where I want to be. <b>PEACE.<br>

<p align="center"><a name="Counseling and Compulsiveness"><b>Counseling
and Compulsiveness</b></a><b><br>
by Michelle</b> </p>

<p align="center">My counselor gave me an assignment last week to
make a pro and con list of an issue I was struggling over. In
doing so, I began to grasp the beneifts of list making as a
problem-solving tool. So, I made another list for why I should go
back to school now and a list for why I should wait; a list of
reasons to tell my family about methadone and a list of the
resons not to; a list of the things I still miss about drugs and
a list of the things I don't. In short, I reduced the major
dilemmas of my life into several numbered phrases that fit on
small pieces of scrap paper. When I brought the finished product
to my counselor's office, he noticed a pattern in the nature of
my &quot;self help.&quot; I had compulsively listed the pros and
cons about being compulsive about my compulsions. Everything that
I had addressed was based on overdoing something and the problems
that taking everything to the extreme had caused me, yet I had
done even this in excess, producing twenty-some lists.<br>
<br>
I remember something I heard long ago spoken by a true substance
abuser: &quot;If you can't be intense about something, why be
anything at all?&quot; I took this statement to heart because it
was exactly how I felt. I had to be the most, the worst, the
wildest, or whatever superlative fit the situation. My
competitiveness stemmed from a fear of anonymity but essentially
was part of my character makeup. I was, and still am, an
extremest, and it seems inevitible that my ultimate drug of
choice would be the superlative of them all--heroin.<br>
<br>
With a personality like mine and a hankering for intensity, I
visited the usual spots (some against my will) and landed here at
the clinic where superlative sorts line up every day. Not all the
other patients desire things in the way that I do (borderline
nutso), but we all have had at least a small taste of what it
means to be driven. Let's face it, being an addict takes
initiative and know-how. The point that my counselor made after
reading my lists and noticing my compulsiveness was that this
energy needs to be used in productivity. Was this something that
I had never heard? No, but for the first time I considered
letting myself be the best instead of the worst. The worst, the
baddest, the meanest, the wildest--that was always a sure thing.
the best is something that I'm definitely going to have to work
hard at. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Urinalysis Policies"><b>Urinalysis
Policies</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">Most of us who have been in treatment for any
length of time have had trouble with &quot;dirty urines&quot;--we
have either had the problem of the test picking up a substance
that should not be there or of having &quot;no methadone&quot;
detected. There are three things which can cause these instances:
<br>
<br>
1. An over-the-counter drug caused a false positive.<br>
2. The lab made a mistake.<br>
3. We have &quot;used&quot; something we should not have, or we
have not taken the methadone.<br>
<br>
There are many over-the-counter drugs which cause false
positives. Steps are being taken to see that no one is falsely
accused of something they did not do. The new lab we will be
using will be saving urine samples for a period of time. If there
are any questions, they can be re-tested. Also, I am supplying
counselors with a list of the drugs I am familiar with that can
cause false positives. <br>
<br>
These results are not engraved in gold as there is always the
possibility of human error. Again, if you feel there is a
mistake, the sample can be re-tested. Talk with your counselor
regarding procedure.<br>
<br>
Although false positives and human error are a real concern for
us, there are those who play with the program and use other drugs
to supplement their methadone. You know who you are. It does not
make you a bad person, but it does cause problems for the program
and, most importantly, for yourself. If you are using other
substances, talk with your counselor--be honest. <br>
<br>
Your counselor should have a pretty good idea if you are telling
the truth or not. If your drug of choice shows up in your urine
screen every other time you drop and re-testing shows the same
result, your protests will certainly be suspect. If, however, you
are doing what you are supposed to be doing, you should be taken
at your word. That is why it is important to let your counselor
know what is going on with you. If you have been following your
treatment plan but all of a sudden show behavior changes, and
then come up with a dirty urine, you might have some explaining
to do. An honest relationship with your counselor is essential
and beneficial to you in more ways than one. </p>

&amp; Confused<br>
by Rose</b> </p>

<p align="center">Before entering the methadone program, I had no
life. i could not function without a blow I believed that nothing
could help me. I always said I would never use methadone. But I
went to the clinic out of desperation. the medication helped me
to stop using heroin. I was surprised that I actually enjoyed my
counseling sessions.<br>
<br>
For two years, I did everything that I was supposed to do. I
began to like myself. My appearance improved, I gained weight,
and I felt good. My clinic's doctor and my counselor recognized
my progress and granted me take-home privileges. I was beginning
to live again.<br>
<br>
Just when I thought that things couldn't be better, a terrible
thing happened. The man whom I loved for fourteen years died. It
hadn't occurred to me that I might have to cope with being alone.
I was half crazy out of my mind and felt I had nowhere to turn. .
.I relapsed.<br>
<br>
I don't think that I believed I would find the answers I was
looking for by returning to heroin. I was running from my
problems as I had in the past. The help I needed was right under
my nose. I told my counselor the truth about my relapse and
started attending group therapy at the clinic. I had the
solutions I needed within me. The support I received from my
counselor and the group helped me to find them.<br>
<br>
I was back on the right track and doing well. I had nearly ninety
days clean again. Then I saw the clinic doctor for a routine
medical exam. The doctor asked why I suddenly had several opiate
urine reports after having a clean record. I explained the
circumstances, but she revoked my take-home privileges anyway. to
make matters worse, she said that my privileges would be restored
ninety days from that day instead of ninety days after my most
recent positive urine report.<br>
<br>
The story doesn't end here. I was feeling depressed about what
had happened to me. I didn't think there was anything left to go
wrong. Then I got the news: Another urine report was positive for
opiates! When I relapsed, I was honest with my counselor and
admitted to using heroin. But this time, I was clean! I realize
that this might arouse suspicion in some people, but I have no
reason to be dishonest. Something must have gone wrong at the
lab--maybe the samples were switched. My counselor said that
nothing could be done. I would have to wait ninety days <b><i>again</i></b>
before I would get my take-home privileges. I believe that my
clinic and the lab that they hire should work harder to eliminate
error. It's difficult enough to fight a drug problem without
being penalized for the mistakes of others. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Principles"><b>Principles</b></a><b>
vs. Personalities<br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">Many of us are familiar with the term
&quot;Principles before Personalities&quot; from Twelve-Step
meetings we have attended in our attempts to be free from drugs
and/or alcohol. The 12th Tradition states, &quot;Anonymity is the
spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to
place principles before personalities.&quot; The definition of
principle is &quot;an essential truth upon which other truths are
based&quot;, or &quot;a rule by which a person chooses to govern
his conduct, often forming part of a code.&quot; The definition
of personality is, &quot;the totality of characteristics which
make up a person.&quot;<br>
<br>
Addicts are not the only ones guilty of breaking this tradition.
One of the most egregious expressions of putting personalities
before principles is the double-standard by which Harry
Anslinger, the first commissioner of the Bureau of Narcotics,
treated street addicts as opposed to those with good connections.
Senator McCarthy was of &quot;sufficient prominence&quot; to have
had the protection of the commissioner while he obtained his
narcotics from a Washington pharmacy without interference from
Bureau agents. However, Anslinger was opposed to any treatment
which supplied narcotics to addicts on the street, and he
rigorously enforced laws against them. He depicted those who
smoked marijuana as monsters, and his campaign against it was
liberally strewn with ads about them as wild-eyed drug fiends who
butchered whole families. If Anslinger's principles <b><i>truly</i></b>
opposed drugs instead of the people he slandered, McCarthy's
narcotic use would have been included in his opposition. This
preferential treatment is clearly a violation of &quot;Principles
before Personalities.&quot; <br>
<br>
We can all learn from this by asking ourselves in any situation,
&quot;Are my values consistent? Do I treat everyone in a
consistent manner, or do I give preferential treatment?&quot; If
you recognize yourself breaking the rules, ask yourself
&quot;Why?&quot; Do you break the rules for people you like and
apply stricter rules to those you don't? Sometimes we don't
listen to what a person has to say because we don't care for
him/her personally, and often that is the very thing we need to
hear. I would often sit in a meeting listening intently to what
each person said, then at the point that a certain
&quot;personality&quot; spoke, I would tune her/him out because I
didn't like that person. That's a red light, bell-ringing
situation for me.<br>
<br>
Finally, &quot;Principles before Personalities&quot; means that
we watch out for that intruder, the <b><i>ego</i></b>. We all
want recognition; we all need recognition, and there's nothing
wrong with that. However, when working toward our common goal of
recovery, it's not about you, and it's not about me; it's about
us. Recovery is a journey; we all have something to offer on that
journey, and none of us can do it by ourselves, contrary to what
the <b><i>ego</i></b> tells us. </p>

<p align="center"><b>First </b><a name="Advocacy"><b>Advocacy</b></a><b>
Meetings Held<br>
by Jon</b> </p>

<p align="center"><b>DETROIT - </b>The first methadone patient
advocacy meetings took place in Detroit and Roseville last month.
Interest in patient advocacy has spread rapidly throughout the
state. Though it is largely centered in the Detroit metropolitan
area, inquiries have come from as far away as Grand Rapids and
Muskegan. Patients from Flint and Toledo, Ohio have also
expressed an interest in the movement.<br>
<br>
Back issues of <b><i>Methadone Awareness</i></b>, the newsletter
of the Philadelphia and Atlantic City chapter of the National
Alliance of Methadone Advocates (NAMA) have been circulating
around Detroit for several months. A group of Detroit patients
were already in the process of forming an advocacy group when
they became aware of NAMA through <b><i>Methadone Awareness</i></b>.
Meanwhile, a counselor at a Detroit clinic read about NAMA in <b><i>Addiction
Treatment Forum</i></b>. Soon, another newsletter, the <b><i>M.A.L.T.A.
Messenger</i></b> began circulating around clinics in Detroit.
Methadone as A Legitimate Treatment Alternative (MALTA) is a NAMA
affiliate in California.<br>
<br>
Detroit patients were infuriated this year by malicious attacks
on methadone by the local broadcast media. Two of Michigan's
largest clinics were targeted, but all of the state's methadone
programs have felt the impact of the heavily biased reports.
Patients were left to try to explain to their families and
employers that methadone is not legal dope. Some were pressured
by their spouses to detox.<br>
<br>
In Lansing, attempts are being made to limit public assistance
benefits to methadone patients. Patients have been harassed by
government officials attempting to persuade them to go into
28-day inpatient programs. These are only a few of the problems
with being a methadone patient in Michigan. These and other
issues have prompted the formation of the organization, Detroit
Organizational Needs in Treatment (DONT). The first meetings have
been successful. DONT is in the process of becoming a chapter of
NAMA. </p>

<p align="center"><b>DONT </b><a name="Ignore"><b>Ignore</b></a><b>
Patient Advocacy in Michigan<br>
by Jon</b> </p>

<p align="center">Detroit Organizational Needs in Treatment
(DONT) is the new methadone patient advocacy organization in
Michigan. there is a critical need for methadone patient advocacy
in Michigan. There is a critical need for methadone patient
advocacy in Michigan. Negative media coverage, harassment from
the government, and clinics with inhumane policies are some of
the problems we face. Together, we can form a strong voice so
that our pleas can he heard. DONT will create avenues of
communication between patients, givernment officials, and program
administrators. We must find a middle ground where we can come
together to strive for understanding of one another.<br>
<br>
We cannot continue to lay quietly in the background while
officials in Washington and Lansing make decisions about our
lives. We cannot endure policy changes without our consultation.
Many of us are registered voters. DONT members who are not
registered to vote <b><i>will</i></b><i> </i>register. Most of us
have the power to choose the clinics where we receive treatment.
As individuals, we had little impact when quitting programs to
express dissatisfaction. And, all too often, we left one program
only to find more dissatisfaction at another. As a group, we have
power and discourage members from remaining in programs with
unreasonable policies.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, some of us are beginning to lose the right to
choose. Patients with Medicaid are being ordered out of their
programs and are forced to enroll in whatever program the state
decides they should be in.<br>
<br>
It is not our intent to make irrational demands. We simply wish
to be treated with the respect and dignity afforded to patients
receiving other kinds of medical treatment. Methadone is an
effective treatment for our disease. Those of us who are
successful in methadone treatment are serious patients. We feel
that we get inadequate recognition or none at all. Thos few
patients among us who are not interested in treatment get a
disproportionately high level of attention. It is those very few
who make no attempt to seek recovery who tend to loiter near
clinics or divert their medication. Yet, these few patients are
given the spotlight when politicians need a cause to promote
their own self-serving agendas. These are also the patients whom
the media portrays as &quot;typical&quot; methadone patients.
Cancer patients have diverted medication. Yet there are no known
cases of cancer patients being refused treatment for diverting or
being portrayed as typical by the media or government.<br>
<br>
We intend to begin communication with clinics and government
officials by wiping the slate clean. We are concerned with the
present and the future. We invite the State of Michigan, CSAS,
and all methadone programs to work with us, to hear our concerns.
We know that we are not on a one-way street. What do you need
from us? We will work with you to eliminate the negative
appearance of methadone treatment. We will help to eliminate
diversion and abuse. In return, we simply ask that you hear our
pleas--we must have the respect and dignity we deserve. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Take Home Med Policies: What Is </b><a
name="Fair"><b>Fair</b></a><b>?<br>
by Nancy R.</b> </p>

<p align="center">I have been on methadone for over twenty years.
I continued using street drugs such as heroin and Dilaudid for
the first ten years of my methadone treatment (1975 to 1985). But
during the second decade, 1985 to present, I have used only
methadone. My urines have been negative for illicit drugs. I
began to use methadone as it was intended to be used and turned
my life around. I work full time and am taking college courses at
night to complete work on my bachelor's degree. I got married and
have reestablished family ties. I am involved with Narcotics
Anonymous and feel that I am growing spiritually. I credit
methadone with saving my life!<br>
<br>
So what is my complaint? My concern is with the State of
Michigan's regulations concerning take-home privileges. Under the
regulations, methadone patients who have been prescribed 100mg or
more per day must receive special permission from state and
federal authorities to have take-home privileges. One time per
week take-home medication is out of the question unless you have
a serious medical condition or travel hardship.<br>
<br>
I am most comfortable at 150mg. I have been trying to decrease my
dosage to below 100mg so that I can be eligible for once-a-week
take homes. I believe that the state should drop this arbitrary
dosage of 100mg for determining eligibility for the number of
doses a patient is allowed to take home. This decision should be
left to the clinic's physician. Dosage and take-home priviliges
should be determined on an individual basis. My clinic doctor and
counselor know my ;unique history. They know how much I have
improved my life. They also know that I lead a busy life with
work and school. Going to the clinic every day under these
circumstances seems like a punishment. Shouldn't I be able to
have take-home medication while maintaining at a dose that I am
comfortable with? Haven't I earned this privilege? <br>
<br>
I feel strongly about this. This particular regulation affects
many patients. Our advocacy group must work together to learn how
state regulations are changed in order to provide more
individualized treatment for methadone patients. </p>

<p align="center"><a name="Perception"><b>Perception</b></a><b><br>
by Beth Francisco</b> </p>

<p align="center">We are a society of drug takers. We have a pill
for everything from headache to backache, to go to sleep or stay
awake, contraceptives or fertility pills, and we want to feel
good right now. The problem is, the government has decided which
drugs are no good for us and which are okay. People can't help
but be confused--myself included. It was okay for me to take
narcotics for a long time while addicted under the care of a
doctor. There was no social stigma, they were affordable, and I
could function. When I first started buying drugs on the street,
I was taking the same drug that I got from the doctor, but it was
at that point that I became stigmatized as a weak, incompetent
person. What had changed? Not the drug certainly, and I still had
the same pain, so what had changed? My status, overnight, and the
fact that I had to buy my drug at such an inflated price that
everything I had saved and worked for became the drug dealer's
property.<br>
<br>
I was sent to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me as manic-depressive
(this was the diagnosis of the day--now it's called bi-polar),
and he prescribed Lithium and an anti-depressant. &quot;Don't
take their drugs--take mine!&quot; was the message I got. I took
his drugs, and I couldn't function. I had to hang on to the walls
to walk because I was so disoriented, and I couldn't write
because my hand jerked too badly. When I told the doctor I could
not take <b><i>his </i></b>medication, he said, &quot;Well, I'll
prescribe another drug to counteract the other drugs.&quot; That
makes a lot of sense! If I <b><i>did</i></b> take his drugs, I
would not be a social outcast, but I wouldn't be able to
function; if I <b><i>didn't</i></b> take mine, I wouldn't be able
to function. If I did take mine, I would be an outcast <b><i>and</i></b>
a criminal because possession is a crime. This is madness--the
addict, just by virtue of being an addict, is labelled as a bad
person. </p>
