<H2>Ten Thousand Papers</H2>

<P>
From small beginnings housed on a shelf in an office at the Building
Research and Information Association in Bracknell, UK, the AIVC's
bibliographic database <A HREF="airbase.html" >AIRBASE </A> has
emerged as one of the most popular and user friendly sources of
specialist information on ventilation and its related subject
areas. All those years ago, the database started out as a subset
of air infiltration related records from its parent database,
Ibsedex. In those days access was via telephone modem and the
database used the now cumbersome and outdated software, Status.
A far cry, one could say, from the <U>ten thousand record </U>strong
library of today with its easy to use IdeaList software and multiple
formats - CD or diskette, using Windows or DOS. The name &quot;AIRBASE&quot;
was coined in its early days, and seems to have proved memorable
and popular despite the occasional query from non-ventilation
related agencies!
<H2>Ten Thousand Enquirers!</H2>

<P>
Seventeen years ago the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre
was set up under the auspices of the International Energy Agency.
The bibliographic database was central to its brief, and together
with its library and information service has proved its value
over the years with a total of well over <U>ten thousand enquirers
</U>consulting the services and 100,000 items of literature sent
out over the period.
<P>
Sources are many and varied, including a variety of journals,
reports from research and commercial organisations, conference
proceedings, the AIVC's own publications, which can be provided
on loan, and other items discovered through literature searches
performed on larger databases and through the World Wide Web.
Another major source is of course our own information service
users, many of whom contribute their own work as it is published,
and help to keep the emphasis on new and up-to-date research.
<H2>Information Products and Full Library Support</H2>

<P>
<A HREF="airbase.html" >AIRBASE </A>acts as a source of information
for a variety of information products coming from the AIVC, such
as technical notes, annotated bibliographies and literature lists.
Searches on a wide number of topics are performed for enquirers.
<P>
Around 100 copies of AIRBASE are in current use. Users receive
updates every three months, when the database is updated. At a
cost of &#163;150 to purchasers in participating countries, and
with full library service backup, AIRBASE is a low cost and highly
valuable resource.
<P>

search results, please contact Janet Blacknell at the <A HREF="address.html" >AIVC
