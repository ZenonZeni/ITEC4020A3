Technologies</title></head><body>
<h1>Energy Efficiency in Industrial Technologies</h1><p>
<p>
Industry consumes about 37% of the total energy used in the United States 
each
year, at a cost of about $115 billion--nearly as much as the 1993 annual 
sales
of General Motors Incorporated, the largest U.S. company.  Helping our 
nation's
industries become more productive by using new technologies increases 
energy
efficiency, minimizes or reuses wastes, improves profits, and reduces
pollution.  Additionally, energy efficiency improvements and pollution
prevention measures often complement each other.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities in Industrial Technologies</h2>
<b><i>Cogeneration</i></b> generates steam and electrical energy using 
30% less
fuel than if each is produced separately.  Industrial cogenerators sell 
their
excess power to local electric utilities, generating revenue for their 
plant.<p>

<b><i>Industrial electric motor systems</i></b>--motors, speed drives, 
fans,
compressors, and power distribution systems--account for more than 20% of 
all
electricity used in the United States. That's more electricity than the 
entire
South Atlantic region of the United States uses annually.<p>

By 2010, using more <b><i>efficient electric motor systems</i></b> in the

industrial sector could save 240 billion kilowatt hours of electricity 
annually
(8.5% of total annual electricity production), provide an industrial 
energy
cost savings of $13 billion (nearly equal to the 1993 annual sales of the

Coca-Cola Corporation), and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 48.5 
million
tons.<p>
More than a third of the energy consumed by U.S. industry is used to 
provide
<b><i>process heat, such as hot water and steam</i></b>.  This is about 
equal
to the entire amount of energy used in Texas.<p>

Energy use in intensive process industries such as <b><i>metals, glass, 
paper,
and chemicals, along with petroleum refining and food processing</i></b>, 
can
account for as much as one-fourth of their production costs.  If the
manufacturing processes used by these energy-intensive industries could 
be made
more efficient, then these firms could be more competitive.<p>

<b><i>Direct steelmaking</i></b>, which eliminates steps from the steel
production process, could reduce energy use by 20%, while reducing
air-polluting emissions.<p>

<b><i>Chemical feedstocks</i></b>, the raw materials used to make other
products such as drugs, plastics, or fertilizer, can be made with 
forestry and
agricultural products instead of petroleum-based feedstocks.  These
biomass-based chemical feedstocks help create significant new markets for

agricultural products.<p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities in Waste Reduction Technologies</h2>
U.S. industry produces more than 14 billion tons of waste that cost more 
than
$45 billion to treat and dispose of properly in 1990--that's more than
Chrysler Corporation's annual sales revenues for 1993.<p>

A program operated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has shown that 
an
energy/waste assessment can save the average small- to medium-sized plant 
more
than $20,000 per year.<p>

<b><i>Solar energy</i></b> can destroy hazardous wastes.  Concentrated 
sunlight
can be used to decontaminate and detoxify water and air.<p>

<b><i>Landfill gas</i></b>, an environmental and safety problem, can and 
is
being captured and converted to energy to produce electricity, heat, or 
steam.
With minimal cleaning, it can be used directly in boilers to create steam 
for
industrial uses.  Using landfill gas does not require a large capital
investment for equipment such as generators.<p>

Landfills for municipal solid waste are becoming scarce.  Today we have 
about
6000 landfills, down from 30,000 in 1976.  About 45% of these 6000
landfills are close to capacity and may close in the near future.<p>

Each year, Americans discard more than 200 million tons of solid waste.  
At
present, about 33% of these wastes are used to generate energy or produce 
raw
materials for recycling into new products.  The remainder, about 135 
million
tons, is sent to landfills and represents a great potential for 
additional
energy production or recycling.<p>

Municipal solid waste can be converted to energy by (1) directly burning 
it to
produce steam or electricity, or (2) converting municipal solid waste 
into fuel
pellets and mixing it with coal.  Both methods improve the environment by

reducing the amount of solid wastes that must be landfilled.<p>
