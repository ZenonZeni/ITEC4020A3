Since the first atomic bomb explosion in New Mexico in 1945 and the advent of nuclear "power," nearly all of the continental United States has been irradiated by nuclear fallout. Today, 1,321 of the total 3,053 counties in the U.S. are nuclear counties, meaning the residents live within 100 miles of a reactor. In other words, more than 33% of those living in the continental U.S. are regularly exposed to nuclear radiation. These residents suffer higher than average rates of breast cancer, AIDS, and other immune deficiencies, and, among infants, premature births, low birth weights, reduced intelligence, and depressed thyroids.<p>
A former employee of the Environmental Protection Agency, Jay M. Gould bases his conclusions on meticulous research he compiled from data from the National Cancer Institute, state health departments, and the Centers for Disease Control. This data reveals that more than 1.5 million American women have died of breast cancer since the start of the "nuclear age" whereas prior to 1945, the rate of breast cancer incidence was actually declining. <p>
The exposure of an entire generation—Baby Boomers born between 1945 and 1965, the height of nuclear testing—to man-made fission products has led to an unprecedented increase in illness, says Gould. The toxic situation is even worse in heavy rainfall areas—East coast, Great Lakes, the Northwest—where nuclear radiation combines with chemical pesticides, industrial pollutants, and other environmental toxins in rain. This deadly amalgam enters surface water reservoirs, public drinking water, and thus the human body faster. <p>
That the New York metropolitan area (including Long Island and southern Connecticut) has the country's greatest concentration of breast cancer mortality is directly attributable to its proximity to 4 nuclear facilities (including Brookhaven National Laboratory) and the deadly confluence of environmental factors cited above, says Gould. Here the breast cancer death rates are as high as 32 per 100,000 compared to 28 in the irradiated Northeast, an average 25.8 for nuclear counties, and 22 in nonnuclear counties. "This means that in the 'nuclear' counties for every 100,000 women, there are nearly 4 more deaths today than in nonnuclear counties—an extraordinarily significant difference," Gould says.<p>
Gould marshals a huge body of health statistics to prove conclusively that those who live in proximity to active nuclear power stations or research facilities (which release radioactive gases, toxic liquid, and solid wastes) have far higher rates of disease than those who do not. The 1,321 nuclear counties account for more than 50% of all breast cancer deaths, says Gould. He also notes that the 14 counties that house the 7 oldest nuclear reactors (maintained by the Department of Energy) had a 37% increase in breast cancer deaths between 1950 and 1989, compared to only 1% for all of the U.S.<p>
Gould's research demonstrates convincingly that negative health effects such as breast cancer mortality are directly related to residential proximity to nuclear radiation. There has been an "overall decline in the health of all age-groups," says Gould, and this cannot be explained without "taking into consideration the great environmental changes" produced by the use of nuclear power. The true cost of winning World War II with nuclear power, says Gould, has been "an uncontrollable epidemic rise in radiation-induced illnesses and in the costs of medical care."<p>
For example, not many people know that in 1945, the Hanford nuclear weapons facility in Washington State accidentally released an amount of radioactive iodine into the U.S. atmosphere equivalent to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. As a result, 150 million Americans were exposed to the fallout of the nuclear cloud as it drifted across the country. <p>
Since 1945, 184 atmospheric nuclear bombs have been detonated over Nevada, a fire power equal to 15,000 Hiroshima bombs; clouds containing nuclear fallout from these explosions have drifted over nearly all of the continental U.S. Combined fallout from all above-ground nuclear testing by the U.S. and the former U.S.S.R. is estimated to be equivalent to 40,000 Hiroshima bombs.<p>
"The true health effects of ingesting man-made fission products have been withheld from the public for nearly half a century," says Gould. He criticizes mainstream media for ignoring the current large number of class action suits by victims of radiation releases against nuclear facilities. Gould also lambasts the National Cancer Institute's myopic (or willful) distortion of the data in their 1990 report that failed to find any convincing links between radiation exposure and cancer.<p>
"We must press for an end to the production of nuclear weapons and operation of nuclear reactors which destroy the health and economic future of our nation," urges Gould. <p>
