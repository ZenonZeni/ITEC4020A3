<p>The vehicle&#146;s architecture comprises several systems:
Support System: the energy distribution and monitoring module; its
task is also to handle emergency situations by surfacing the
vehicle. Propulsion System: controls propellers and rudders,
tracks a series of set points provided by the Dynamic Control
System; it also feeds back propulsion data to the Dynamic Control
System for closed loop control, and to the Mission Supervisor for
assessment of vehicle status. Dynamic Control System: accepts the
reference trajectory from the Mission Supervisor and the
information coming from the Navigation System and sends commands
to the Propulsion System. Environmental Inspection System: a series
of sensors for environmental data acquisition. Communications
System: manages communications between the vehicle and the human
operator, via exchange of messages, instructions, warnings and so
on; it is also responsible for the encoding and decoding of
messages. Navigation System: provides accurate estimates of
vehicle position and speed; it sends data to the Dynamic Control
System and to the Mission Supervisor for vehicle status and
performance assessment. Mission Supervisor: coordinates the
execution of mission tasks in accordance with the mission plan provided
by the operator; it is composed of three blocks: a Task
Scheduler, which performs task management on the basis of
operator&#146;s instructions and system status; a System
Coordination Module, to manage the exchange of information within
system modules; and a Status Assessment Module, which determines
vehicle status by examining data from the other modules. </p>

<p>The proposed control structure derives from the analysis of
the global system organization of the MARIUS AUV. In order to
achieve a well-defined plan and control mechanism, a hierarchical
structure is proposed, which to some extent recalls the concept
of Increasing Intelligence with Decreasing Precision. The
structure has a dynamic configuration capability: the system can
dynamically configure the connections between modules and store
information about the state of this configuration, in order to
allow the most suitable translations of planned actions into
commands. Moreover, the hierarchical structure allows the use of
some reactive behaviours, whose purpose is to handle safety and
integrity actions: they do not represent planned actions, but are
activated in certain conditions. </p>

<p>Three different layers are proposed. Organization level: the
Mission Planner uses a well defined language and grammar to
generate mission plans (waypoints and attitudes) on the basis of
the mission doctrine; Path Planner refines mission path in order
to obtain feasible trajectories; Mission Supervisor performs
mission monitoring, teleoperations and interaction with the
operator. Coordination level: coordinates the execution of
activities related to the accomplishment of mission goals; Plan
Interpreter generates a detailed action plan on the basis of
sensor information about the vehicle and the environment; Plan
Supervisor schedules the tasks for execution by the appropriate
functional modules and reacts to emergency conditions;
Architecture Coordinator manages the configuration of links
between the different modules of the functional layer: different
configurations may be scheduled depending on the evolution of the
mission situation, and the best available alternative is chosen;
dynamic adaptation of architecture to changing environmental conditions
is performed to maintain operational consistency; Task Refinement
transforms specified tasks into sequences of actions, according
to the mission context; Global Exception Handler is a high level
manager of error conditions and is invoked when lower level
modules are not able to cope with errors. Functional modules:
primitive modules are responsible for sensing and actuation, and
are connected according to decisions at the Coordination level; reactive
system behaviours correspond to different connections between
these modules; complex functional modules are composed of groups
of primitive modules in order to achieve higher level behaviours,
and to increase system modularity and expandability. </p>
