<p>
The International Energy Agency (IEA) was created to facilitate 
collaborations for the economic development, energy security, 
environmental protection and well-being of its members and of the world 
as a whole. The IEA is currently comprised of 23 member countries, 13 of 
which are active <a href="particpa.htm"><I>participants</I></a> in the 
program focused on the Utilization and Production of Hydrogen.
<p>
The Hydrogen Program, or Implementing Agreement, has been in existence 
for nearly 20 years. Its mission is to advance hydrogen technologies and 
accelerate its acceptance and widespread utilization. Past collaborations 
have been in the areas of Thermochemical Production, High Temperature 
Reactors, Electroloysis, Storage, Safety, and Markets. Currently there 
are three active Tasks, or Annexes available:
