<H3>Fuel Design Trends in Indian PHWRs. S A Bhardwaj, A G Chhatre and M Ravi.</H3>
<P>


India's long-term nuclear strategy involves the optimal usage of domestic uranium and thorium
resources. The reactor technology developed for the first stage of the programme is the
pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) which has evolved from an initial collaboration with
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) at the Rajasthan power plant. Second stage
technology will use plutonium arising from the first stage in fast breeder reactors (FBRs). The
conversion of thorium to U-233 will be taken up in these FBRs, for use in subsequent FBRs or
in advanced fuel cycles in PHWRs.<P>

The Indian PHWRs are 220/235 MWe units employing on-load fuelling. Seven units are in
operation and five are under construction or commissioning. Designs for a 500 MWe PHWR and
a 500 MWe FBR have also been completed.<P>

Initial fuel for the PHWR was the 19 element Canadian design first used in the Rajasthan plant
in 1971. Since then the fuel has been developed and performance has steadily improved.
Developments have in some cases been prompted by Canadian experience, eg the use of graphite
coating to overcome the problem of fuel failure induced by power ramps, while in other cases
India has developed its own technical solutions to problems.<P>

Power flattening in PHWR first cores has been achieved by use of depleted uranium bundles.
Fabricating these bundles interrupted the mass production of the natural uranium fuel so the use
of thorium bundles for power flattening was developed. 35 thorium bundles have now been loaded
into Kakrapar-1 and a similar pattern is being adopted for all new PHWRs.<P>

A first step towards advanced fuel cycles will be the introduction of MOX fuel in the 19 element
bundle.  MOX-7 fuel has been designed to cope with the problems of online refuelling with MOX.
With this fuel discharge burnup would increase from 6700 MWd/tU to 10 300 MWd/tU with a
corresponding decrease in the refuelling requirement. Investigation has led to the conclusion that
19 element fuel bundle is not ideal for extended burnup or MOX and a 22 element bundle is being
designed for this situation. This new design will also allow a 15% power uprating of the core.
Two channel loads of this fuel have now been successfully test irradiated at the Madras power
plant. In addition a 37 element fuel bundle has been designed for the 500 MWe PHWR.<P>
