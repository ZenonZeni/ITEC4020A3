<B>MNR Awarded Two-Year Coyote & Fox Rabies Contract in Texas
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources has been awarded a two-year contract to drop 2.5 million baits over more than 100,000 square kilometres to help in the fight against coyote and fox rabies in Texas.  Texas will pay all MNR expenses including salaries.<P>

"I am very pleased that MNR has been awarded this contract," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "This is further proof of Ontario's worldwide reputation for excellence in rabies research and technology."<P>

The contract begins January 2, 1996.  Last February two MNR Twin Otter aircraft were used in the experimental fight against coyote rabies in the state.  An estimated 800,000 rabies baits were dropped over an area of more than 31,000 square kilometres in less than two weeks.<P>

The plan this year is to expand the coyote rabies bait drop zone to include the area baited last February, and to drop grey fox rabies bait in another part of the state.<P>

During the experimental drop last February, MNR air service staff flew and maintained the two aircraft, while MNR rabies research staff trained their Texas counterparts in the use of the Ontario-designed bait dropping equipment.  The Ontario team included a Queen's University computer specialist who provided navigational data to ensure precise coverage of the target areas.<P>

This year's expanded MNR mission to Texas includes crews for three Twin Otters, five rabies research staff, and the Queen's University computer specialist.  They will work every day for one month to complete the project.<P>

Ontario is well on the way to eliminating fox rabies in the province.  The fox rabies control project, started in 1989, is expected to eliminate the disease in Ontario by the year 2001.<P>

This fall MNR dropped 1.8 million fox rabies vaccine baits in southern Ontario.  In addition, the ministry provided aircraft, baiting machines and staff for similar, smaller-scale, bait-dropping projects in areas of New York State and Quebec which border Ontario.<P>
