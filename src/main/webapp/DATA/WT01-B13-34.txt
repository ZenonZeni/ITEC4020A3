<I>Anyone can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Dodging speeding bullets is overrated.
But 
who can plan a retirement
when they
have their own job to do,
are worried about getting their kids started out right in life
and are helping their parents age comfortably?</I><P>

If anyone can fill the tights of a superhero, it has to be today's 50- to 64-year-olds. If you're in that age group, you know what the pressures are: <P>

<UL>
<LI>Eight out of 10 pre-retirees (those in the 50-plus generation) have adult children, almost one-third of whom live with their parents. Many parents who married "later in life" are paying all or some of their children's college expenses.*<P>

<LI>In part because their parents married and had their children "early" in their lives, half of all pre-retirees have at least one living parent; 22 percent have two living parents. Considering their in-laws, as well, 70 percent of pre-retirees have a parent for whom they have some financial responsibilities.*<P>

<LI>Between 16 and 30 percent of the 50-plus generation are estimated to have set aside nothing toward their retirement due, for the most part, to financial difficulties.**<P>

<LI>Women in this generation often quit full-time employment to spend 18 hours a day or more serving as a home nurse without pay.***<P>
</UL>

Well, superhero, we'd like you to walk back into that telephone booth and transform yourself into plain old average Clark or Clarkina Kent - who will be retiring in the next 10 to 15 years. We'd like you to contemplate your retirement and how you might prepare for it. (And if it helps at all, you might want to think of your retirement years as one powerful locomotive barreling toward you.)
