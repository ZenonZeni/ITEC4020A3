<H3>More on the Counter-Terrorism Bill that passed the House on August 2, 1996</H3>

On Friday August 2, the House of Representatives passed a revised counter-terrorism bill by a margin of 389 to 22.  The House-passed bill DOES NOT contain ANY of the privacy threatening provisions.  Provisions dealing with funding for the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (Digital Telephony) were REMOVED from the bill just before the vote after civil liberties groups AND the FBI objected to the language. Provisions dealing with emergency wiretap authority and "roving wiretaps" were also not included in the House-passed bill.
<P>
In addition, the bill does not contain any encryption provisions. On July 29, the Administration had circulated <A HREF="960729_admin_fact.html">an outline of their
anti-terrorism proposal</A> which included new, unspecified restrictions on
encryption.  Senators Conrad Burns (R-MT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Larry Pressler (R-SD), Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
(R-MS), and others worked hard to prevent any encryption provisions from
being included in early versions of the bill, and deserve a lot of credit
for fighting for the Net. 
<P>
The bill passed today contains provisions increasing airport security,
studies on ways to improve US anti-terrorism policy and other terrorism
issues, and a provision expanding federal racketeering laws
to cover terrorist activity.
<P>
The bill also contains a small, but not insignificant, privacy victory. The
bill doubles the punishment from 5 to 10 years for unlawful disclosure of
information obtained from a warrant and increases certain penalties for
violation of the Privacy Act.
<P>
The Senate did not vote on the bill before they recessed for the month.  The Senate will most likely take up consideration of the bill when Congress returns in September.  This means that this issue isn't over yet.  The Senate could add provisions to the bill, such as Digital Telephony funding and proposed restrictions on encryption, so stay tuned....
<P>
Thanks to everyone who called Congress to object to the new sweeping
surveillance provisions that were dropped from the bill! It looks like we
may have really made a difference in this debate.
