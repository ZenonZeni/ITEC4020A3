<a name="RTFToC2">Devaluation
and Mexico to US Migration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Avoiding increased Mexico-to-US unauthorized migration due to recession in
Mexico and a wider US-Mexican wage gap was a pillar argument in favor of the
Clinton Administration's proposal to provide $40 billion in Congressionally
approved loan guarantees to Mexico.  The loan guarantee proposal was withdrawn
on January 31, 1995, and replaced with a package of aid that does not require
Congressional approval.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Mexico's peso hit a record low of US$1=6.55 on January 30, 1995, down over
40 percent from the $1=3.45 pesos on December 20, 1994.  After the announcement
of the aid program, the peso rebounded to $1=5.75 pesos.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Many in Congress wanted to make the loan guarantee conditional on Mexico
cooperating with the US to reduce illegal immigration.  Although the aid
package has no formal side conditions on immigration, US officials reported
that there was an "understanding" that Mexico would cooperate with the US to
manage migration.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton, among others, argued that the Mexican aid package would
"help us to better protect our borders."  The 1982 peso devaluation of 72
percent<b> </b>was followed by a 30 percent increase in apprehensions in 1983
and 1984, from about 1 million to 1.3 million.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Legal and unauthorized Mexican migration to the US, which averaged about
300,000 settlers and 800,000 to two million sojourners per year over the past
decade, is expected to increase as a result the peso devaluation and hard times
in Mexico.  The US Treasury originally predicted 30 percent or 430,000
additional illegal entries in 1995--implying a "normal" flow of 1.4 million
unauthorized Mexican entries per year-- if the US did not provide aid to
Mexico.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Treasury Department based its estimates partially on research by Tom
Espenshade, a Princeton demographer, who used INS apprehension data to estimate
that a 40 percent peso devaluation would increase illegal entries by about
460,000 annually.  However, most of these additional illegal Mexican entrants
would probably not settle in the US--the estimated increase in the settled
illegal Mexican population would be only about 40,000, implying that the US
loan guarantee would have provided $1 million for each settled illegal Mexican
migrant avoided.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Treasury assumed a 1 to 1 linkage between the peso and emigration, meaning
that a 1 percent devaluation would be follows by a one percent increase in
illegal immigration.  Most migration researchers were unwilling to be so
precise, and few believe that the relationship between the peso and emigration
is linear.  INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, for example, says only that
emigration pressure will increase.  Village economic modeling by UCD Professor
Ed Taylor finds that a 10 percent devaluation in the 1980s was associated with
18 percent more emigration, but a 30 percent devaluation increases exits from
Mexican villages of persons headed for the  US by 25 percent.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Not everyone agrees that the peso devaluation will immediately increase
unauthorized Mexico-to-US migration.  Mexican migration expert Jorge Bustamante
noted that coyotes set the cost of being smuggled into the US in dollars, and
that some potential migrants may not be able to accumulate 30 percent more to
pay smugglers immediately.  Michael Teitelbaum of the Commission on Immigration
Reform noted that the increased value in Mexico of the $3 to $4 billion in
remittances from US migrants may make potential migrants better off, if
Mexicans in the US continue to remit at the same levels and inflation in Mexico
does not offset the effects of the devaluation.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Along the US-Mexican border, there are reports that apprehensions and
attempted illegal entries rose in January 1995, but it will be several months
before it can be determined whether reports of increased unauthorized
border-crossings reflect the peso devaluation and hard times in Mexico or
represent reactions by the usual flow of unauthorized migrants to INS border
control efforts.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There is general agreement that the migration effects of the peso
devaluation will not become apparent until March or April 1995, when seasonal
migrants seek US jobs.  These migrants will have to elude a beefed up Border
Patrol to enter the US illegally.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Emigration pressures and migration flows will also depend on economic
prospects in Mexico and California, the destination of most illegal Mexican
immigrants.  On January 3, 1995, Mexican President Zedillo made a speech that
laid out plans to deal with the economic crisis that caused the peso to lose
over 30 percent of its value in the last two weeks of 1994.  The theme of the
speech was sacrifice and austerity--wages and prices are to rise slower than
inflation, the government will try to sell off more public enterprises, and
government spending is to be cut.  On January 17, 1995, the Zedillo government
and the opposition parties signed a political reform agreement designed to
minimize political unrest by ensuring honest elections, thus restoring the
confidence of foreign investors.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A sluggish Mexican economy in 1995 could increase both internal migration
to the northern border areas and emigration pressure.  The Mexican economy is
expected to grow less than one percent in 1995, inflation is projected to be 15
to 20 percent, and some foreign investors may put at least a temporary stop on
plans to build or expand factories and stores, slowing job creation.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The lower wages and costs wrought by the peso devaluation should make
Mexico more attractive to foreign investors.  Indeed, there has already been US
interest in shifting to unused maquiladoras in the border areas plastics and
other light-assembly work to take advantage of Mexican wages and benefits that
have fallen from $2 hourly to $1.50 [about half of these wage costs are payroll
taxes and benefits].  Since labor markets in Mexican border cities are fairly
tight, such an expansion of maquiladora activity should attract internal
migrants to the border.  If the California and US border economies improve as
expected in 1995, there could be more stepping-stone migration across the
border. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There is no doubt that Mexico will, over the next two decades, emerge as an
important low-cost manufacturing center of North America.  But no one knows
exactly when and how this economic transformation will occur.  At least two to
three million of Mexico's five to six million farmers, plus their families, are
likely to leave the land over the next two decades, but it is not clear whether
foreign investment will create jobs for them in central Mexico or in border
areas, or whether many will migrate to the US.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Unlike fast-growing Asian nations, Mexico's 1990s boom was fueled largely
by foreign savings.  An overvalued peso made imports of both capital and
consumer goods cheap, and could be sustained as long as foreigners believed
that Mexico truly was the next "tiger."  In effect, US and other foreign
investors lent money to Mexico, and Mexicans used these foreign savings to buy
US goods--it is in this manner that the US Treasury can assert that $40 billion
in US exports to Mexico supports about 800,000 US jobs.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A report released last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimated
that the peso devaluation will reduce American exports to Mexico by $10 billion
or 20 percent in 1995 versus 1994</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Mexico has learned that foreign money has an easy-come, easy-go quality.
The country achieved more than four percent economic growth-- 4.5 percent--only
in 1990.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>An "orderly" peso devaluation was advocated by the Mexico's new finance
minister during the summer of 1994, but ex-President Salinas reportedly wanted
to be one of the few recent Mexican presidents to leave office without a
massive devaluation.  When the government that took office on December 1,
announced its economic plans, local and foreign investors saw that the $30
billion trade deficit would not be reduced in 1995.  With the Mexican Central
Bank running out of reserves to support the peso, they bet that Mexico would
have to de-value its currency, which it did (MN, Jan 1995).  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The peso devaluation should help to create jobs in Mexico's tourism
industry, third largest after oil and manufacturing.  In 1994, an estimated 17
million US residents visited Mexico, and accounted for about three-fourths of
Mexico's $7.5 billion tourism revenues.  Globally, 528 million international
tourists spent $321 billion in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>During the 1980s, Mexico managed to keep its unemployment rate low despite
depression and economic restructuring--the  official urban unemployment rate
(desempleo abierto) for Mexico fell after 1983, reaching a low of 2.6 percent
in 1991.  Mexico's unemployment rate is low because it measures only persons
separated from formal job relationships, and because "unemployed" persons not
eligible for UI are pushed into marginal jobs and considered employed.  The
unemployed in Mexico are persons who can afford to search for work full
time--usually better educated and more affluent workers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton aid package for Mexico is not popular--79 percent of those
surveyed in one poll opposed it and, near the end of January, groups ranging
from Ross Perot's United We Stand to Prop 187 supporters promised to work to
defeat Mexican aid.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC3">President
Clinton Endorses Registry</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton, in his State of the Union address on January 24, 1995,
emphasized the need to step up efforts to reduce illegal immigration.  Clinton
endorsed the recommendation of the Commission on Immigration Reform to test a
national registry to better prevent unauthorized aliens from obtaining US jobs
[the SAVE system is already in place to prevent unauthorized aliens from
obtaining public benefits].  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In September, 1994, the CIR recommended that pilot projects in the major
immigration states experiment with a computer data base that includes Social
Security Administration and Immigration and Naturalization Service data.
Employers might call a toll free number, and then obtain a confirmation code
that the worker's Social Security Number or INS-A number is valid, eliminating
the need for an I-9 form.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Civil rights groups oppose the registry because they believe it would
increase discrimination and invade privacy.  They also believe that it is one
step closer to requiring a national identity card.  The AFL-CIO Executive
Council endorsed the registry, but withdrew support for the current employer
sanctions system based on employers seeing worker documents and completing I-9
forms because it allegedly increases discrimination against minority
workers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The INS on January 6, 1995 announced plans to add 2,365 employees
nationwide, including 1,200 additional Border Patrol and port of entry agents
to "do something that has never been done before, which is to secure a border
that has never been secure."  By the end of 1995, the Border Patrol is expected
to have over 5,000 agents, and there is talk among Congressional Republicans of
doubling the Border Patrol to 10,000.  Attorney General Reno announced that
beef-up-the-border enforcement efforts have succeeded in stemming illegal
immigration, with apprehensions in San Diego down an estimated one-third from
the same months last year.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>As border controls are reinforced in El Paso and San Diego--where 65
percent of all apprehensions are made-- apprehensions in Arizona doubled to
almost 140,000 in FY94.  There was an especially significant increase in
apprehensions of East Europeans and Asians, suggesting that smugglers believe
that it is easiest to slip high-paying non-Mexicans into the US over the
Arizona border.  Attorney General Reno recently announced that the number of
Border Patrol agents in Arizona would be increased by 30 percent.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Most of the Arizona border crossing activity is between the twin cities of
Nogales, Arizona (pop 25,000) and Nogales, Mexico (pop 250,000).  There has
been a tradition of border crossing between these cities, but as the Arizona
border has become the preferred crossing point, violence has increased.  Tunnel
kids living in cross-border sewer tunnels are accused of leading illegal
immigrants into the US and robbing them, prompting the formation of a
US-Mexican police force to deal with border violence.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC4">Immigration
in the 104th Congress</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Immigration is not in the "contract with America" to which House</tt><p>
<tt>Republicans have promised to devote the first 100 days of Congress, but
Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX ) and Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY) are expected to hold
hearings and get their immigration committees to approve legislation early in
the 104th Congress.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Smith reportedly plans to introduce a national version of California's
Proposition 187, while Simpson on January 24, 1995 introduced legislation (S
269) that would create a three-year five-state pilot verification program.  The
President would be required to institute an improved verification system within
eight years.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Simpson's proposal builds on a 1994 bill that also called for increased
funding to add border patrol agents and investigators, and to streamline
exclusion and deportation proceedings.  It includes stiffer penalties for
document fraud and alien smuggling, and would repeal the law allowing immediate
asylum for Cubans.  Simpson will wait until the CIR releases its study of legal
immigration in June 1995 to introduce a bill reducing legal immigration.
Simpson has advocated a five-year 25 percent reduction in legal immigration,
currently set at 675,000 annually. <b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b></tt><p>
<tt>Although some speculate that Republicans may try to make controlling
immigration a partisan issue, as Governor Wilson allegedly did by endorsing and
campaigning for Prop. 187 in California, both Smith and Simpson have said that
they want to continue the tradition of dealing with immigration in a bipartisan
manner.  Both favor a better worker verification system, and more efforts to
prevent illegal aliens from receiving social services.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>House Republican leaders initially proposed to bar legal aliens from 60
federal programs to save money ($22 billion over five years) and to avoid
alleged abuses, as when children sponsor the immigration of their elderly
parents, who then depend on SSI and Medicare from the moment they become
eligible until they die.  Senator Simpson and many Republican governors opposed
barring legal aliens from all federal programs. A January CNN/USA poll reported
that 62 percent of Americans want to eliminate virtually all benefits,
including education, for unauthorized aliens.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Welfare--federal means-tested assistance-- plays a special role in this
debate.  AFDC-- a $16 billion per year program that makes payments to 14
million people or five percent of the US population at a cost of about one
percent of the US budget--was created during the 1930s so that World War I
widows could stay home with their children.  However, today almost 60 percent
of all women with children under eight are in the labor force, making the
notion of paying women to stay home with children less acceptable.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>About the same numbers of babies are born today as in the early 1960s, but
today one-fourth, versus one-tenth in the early 1960s, are born out of wedlock.
The current welfare system seems especially unable to serve as a bridge to the
labor force for single mothers.  In 1992, 39 percent of AFDC recipients were
Black, and 34 percent were white.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 9, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that House Republicans may
"revisit" the issue of eliminating benefits to legal immigrants in light of an
announcement by Republican governors that they would be willing to accept a
five-year freeze at current federal levels in the block grants devoted to
welfare programs, which would save about $40 billion over five years according
to Gingrich.  Gingrich endorsed the current ban on benefits for illegal
immigrants as the "least destructive" way to save scarce federal funds.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>One compromise is to deny eligibility for benefits for the first few years
after arrival, and then enforce sponsorship agreements to deal with problems
such as those involving elderly immigrants and Supplemental Security Income.
One-fourth of the recipients of SSI in the US are legal immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Republicans would prevent the children of immigrants from bringing their
parents to the US to retire on the SSI program, and encourage these elderly
immigrants to become US citizens.  The CIR, in contrast, recommended that
children who sponsor the entry of their elderly parents be required to sign
binding pledges to support them so that they will not need SSI and other
government programs.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 27, the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation that
would reimburse states for the costs they incur to incarcerate illegal aliens,
who are an estimated 14 percent of California inmates.  California would
receive $400 million under the legislation.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A Newsweek poll found that 60 percent of all Americans think that
additional immigration  would be "bad for the country," spawning proposals to
reduce admissions of, or benefits available to, legal immigrants.  Among the
many proposals are bills introduced by Senator Jesse Helms (D-NC) and Rep
Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) to deny immigrant visas to persons who illegally own,
rent or manage American-owned property abroad.   The intent is to put pressure
on countries such as Cuba, Nicaragua, and Honduras, where American property
that was confiscated is now being used by persons who want to make business
trips to the US.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Representative Ron Packard (R-CA) introduced three bills that he described
as "a three-pronged attack [on illegal immigration]... shore-up our resources
at the US-Mexico border; close the inland checkpoints; and deny taxpayer-funded
benefits to illegal immigrants."  Packard's bill would double the number of
Border Patrol agents from 5,000 to 10,000 within five years. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Representative Bob Stump (R-AZ) introduced on January 4, 1995 the
Immigration Accountability Act of 1995, which would prohibit the payment of
federal benefits to illegal aliens and stop automatic citizenship for the
children of illegal aliens born in the US.  This bill would also limit
immigration to the spouses and minor children of US citizens, "legitimate"
refugees, and persons waiting to immigrate legally for 10 or more years.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL.) reintroduced a Immigration Moratorium Act on
January 6.  The bill places a five-year moratorium on most categories of legal
immigration, and would reduce legal admissions by two-thirds, from the current
900,000 per year to 325,000 annually.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Haitians
in Guantanamo Returned</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On December 29, 1994, the US informed the 4,400 Haitians at Guantanamo that
they would have to return to Haiti, and that those agreeing to return by
January 5 would receive an $80 payment.  Only 677 Haitians--about 1 in
6--accepted the offer.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 5, the US began to return the 3,900 Haitians who had rejected
the payment offer.  Upon their arrival in Haiti, the first 54 were given $15
and taken to the Port-au-Prince bus station.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Several US immigration advocates criticized the return of Haitians, arguing
that the US has neither the legal or moral right to return Haitians.  The US
and Haiti signed an agreement in 1981 that permitted the US to intercept on the
high seas and return to Haiti Haitians seeking to go to the US by boat; that
agreement expired in 1994.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Since President Aristide was restored to power October 15, 1994, over
16,000 of the 21,400 Haitians in Guantanamo in August 1994 have returned to
Haiti.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In Panama, officials report that 31 mostly young male Cubans have tried to
commit suicide as is becomes clearer that they will not be allowed directly
into the US.  There are about 8,600 Cubans in Panama who will be sent to join
the 21,000 Cubans in Guantanamo before the Panama base is closed on March 6.
About 3,000 Cubans have been admitted to the US from the Panama and Guantanamo
camps for family or health reasons, and officials are worried that Cubans may
try to feign mental illness to gain admission to the US.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Farm
Labor Shortages and Guest Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Farmworkers, maids, and janitors are the only three US occupations with one
million or more workers in which most workers are immigrants, and many new
entrants to these work forces are unauthorized aliens.  The combination of the
INS's Operation Gatekeeper and Prop. 187, plus calls by California Governor
Wilson and former Mexican President Salinas, has led to speculation that there
may be serious discussions in 1995 about a temporary US-Mexican program that
would admit farm and perhaps other workers.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Martin Anderson of the Hoover Institute, and former domestic policy advisor
to President Reagan, recently called for large "guest-worker programs, under
which foreign nationals who wish to work in the United States could do so
lawfully, with dignity, with no threat of being hunted down and deported."
According to Anderson, "Once upon a time we had such a program -- and we had no
illegal alien problems."</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Frank del Olmo, deputy editor at the Los Angeles Times, believes illegal
immigration could be controlled if the US negotiates an agreement with Mexico
to open US borders to workers as long as they register with the proper
authorities.  Their return to Mexico could be guaranteed by withholding 25
percent of their pay until they return to Mexico. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The devaluation of the peso is expected to increase Mexico-to-US migration
in 1995, but some farm leaders are nonetheless predicting farm labor shortages.
For example, the chairman of Tri-Valley Growers, a cooperative of 650 fruit and
vegetable growers, predicted that a labor shortage would force up wages in 1995
for the 32,000 workers in nine processing plants.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>US farm employers can request permission to bring into the US temporary
foreign farm workers under the H-2A program.  In 1993, DOL certified that
17,162 farm jobs could be filled by temporary foreign farm workers, and in
1994, 18,939.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In the early 1980s, California farmers led the drive against the then H-2
program, arguing that perishable crop farmers could not make hiring plans
according to H-2 requirements.  Farmers won in IRCA a special agricultural
worker legalization program, and a replenishment agricultural worker program
that would have permitted foreign workers to enter the US in the event of farm
labor shortages.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Minimum
Wages, Jobs, and Immigration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton, in his January 24th State of the Union address, called
for a hike in the minimum wage which is currently $4.25 per hour.  The US
Department of Labor estimates that 2.5 million workers are paid the minimum
wage, and that another 1.7 million are paid less than $4.25 because they e.g.,
receive tips.  Two-thirds of the roughly four million minimum wage earners are
adults over 25, and many are immigrants.  Another 5.5 million US workers earn
$4.25 to $4.75 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Economic theory predicts that a higher minimum wage means fewer jobs, so
economists view minimum wage hikes as a trade off between jobs and wages at the
bottom of the labor market.  Similarly, theory asserts that more immigrants
means more US jobs, but lower wages and worse conditions in immigrant-dominated
labor markets.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>But this trade-off between wages and jobs is relatively small in the US
economy, which offers 125 million jobs.  Most studies agree that a 10 percent
increase in the minimum wage would lead to about one percent fewer jobs, so
that raising the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5, or 18 percent, would reduce the
number of minimum wage jobs from about four million to 3.9 million.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on
Immigration and Claims says that "a sizable minority of illegal immigrants work
for significantly more than the  minimum wage."  He asserted that about 15
percent of illegal alien workers are in the construction industry, where wages
average $9.50 per hour. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>"As the economy becomes more high-tech, more and more lower skilled workers
compete for fewer jobs... The answer is to increase wages to make those jobs
more attractive to Americans.  It is unfair to American workers to allow
illegal aliens to directly compete with them for scarce jobs." </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>According to Smith, the "displacement factor" ranges from one-to-three to
one-to-six, meaning that, for every three to six illegal aliens employed, one
American worker is displaced.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC8">Illegal
Overstayers and Criminal Aliens</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>More than half of the estimated four million illegal aliens believed to be
in the US in October 1994 arrived legally as visitors or students and then
stayed in the US too long or violated the terms of their visas, usually by
working.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were estimated to be 2.1 million overstayers, and 1.9 million aliens
who entered without inspection (EWI).  About 150,000 overstayers and 150,000
EWIs settle in the US each year, increasing the illegal alien population by
300,000 annually.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some 22 million foreign visitors enter the US each year, but only 600 of
the 39,000 deportations in 1993 resulted from visitors who overstayed.  [Most
illegal foreigners depart voluntarily after being detected.]  Foreign visitors
are presumed to want to settle in the US unless they can prove to US consular
officers abroad that they have sufficient ties to their home countries, plus a
round trip ticket, to make them likely to return.  For nationals of the 22
countries in the visa waiver program, only a round trip ticket is required to
visit the US. Countries from which it is estimated that more than 100,000
aliens entered as legal visitors and then settled illegally include Mexico
(357,000), Poland (107,000), Philippines (106,000), and Haiti (102,000).</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Ironbound section of Newark has reportedly been settled by illegal
Portuguese immigrants, many of whom arrived on tourist visas.  There are
estimated to be 17,000 illegal Portuguese in New Jersey, and the Portuguese
enclave in Newark developed after the 1974 military coup in Portugal.  The
Portuguese today are about 40 percent of the area's 40,000 residents, and their
presence is attracting Portuguese-speaking Brazilian immigrants.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 12, the ABC News program Day One aired a segment on the INS's
failure to detain and deport immigrants who had committed crimes and served
their sentences in the US.  Day One estimated that there were 500,000
foreign-born persons in jail or on probation in the US, or about 2.5 percent of
the 23 million foreign-born persons in the US.  After their release from
prison, most criminal aliens can be deported.  The INS in 1993 deported about
20,000 of the 200,000 criminal aliens in the US subject to deportation.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Both Day One and a New York Times profile of bounty hunters employed by
bail bondsmen to track down fugitive criminal aliens were critical of the INS's
failure to locate easy to find criminal aliens who have been ordered out of the
US.  If an alien is charged with committing a crime in the US, he or she is
entitled to due process and a public defender at trial.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>If convicted, there is another hearing--about half the time in jail--at
which a convicted criminal alien can "show cause" why he or she should not be
deported from the US.  In most cases, the alien will be ordered deported unless
he or she can show mitigating circumstances, such as a US citizen family and,
if the hearing is held in jail, the aliens being deported will be taken
directly to a bus or plane upon their release.  At a mid-December hearing of
the CIR, some argued that criminal aliens facing deportations should have
public defenders appointed to represent them (MN, Jan 1995), although few
thought Congress would approve such an expenditure.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Because the INS can detain only 6,000 aliens nationwide, some criminal
aliens released from prison are ordered to post a bond that guarantees they
will show up for deportation hearings.  Many fail to show, but reporters found
it easy to find the criminal aliens who failed to surrender.  The INS argues
that it does not have sufficient resources to detect and detain criminal
aliens, although bounty hunters in New York allege that, in some instances, INS
refused to accept criminal aliens brought to their offices because they had no
more room to detain them, or the INS would have had to find travel documents in
order to get them into their country of citizenship.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 9, Senator William Roth (R-DE) introduced legislation to
facilitate the apprehension, detention and deportation of criminal aliens.  The
legislation, S179, or the Criminal Alien Control Act of 1995, streamlines the
deportation process for criminal aliens by, among other things, requiring
aliens who are not permanent residents and who wish to appeal deportation
orders, to do so from their home countries, after they have been deported.  The
legislation further streamlines the process by allowing state and federal
judges to order the deportation of criminal aliens.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Prop
187 Aftermath</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Wilson Administration continues to draft regulations to implement Prop.
187.  On January 27, the Wilson Administration sued to have the
constitutionality of Prop. 187 determined first in California state courts,
thereby removing the case from a Los Angeles federal judge who has issued an
injunction blocking Prop. 187's implementation.  The governor's suit asks a
federal Court of Appeals to permit a state court to determine Prop. 187's
validity.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>News reports in January 1995 reported that, while fearful, unauthorized
immigrants' lives in California are "returning to normal."  Clinics report the
usual number of patients, and immigrant activists report that they do not know
of any unauthorized immigrants who have left California because of Prop. 187.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>As before the election, reports of "mixed families" illustrate how
difficult it would be to enforce Prop. 187's provisions.  For example, in many
households, the father is a legal immigrant, the baby is US born and a US
citizen, and the mother and older children are unauthorized.  In such a family,
issues arise about who gets services?  Do privacy laws protect the unauthorized
members of the family when legal members seek services, or when the
unauthorized mother seeks services for her US citizen baby?</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are estimated to be 950 illegal aliens among the 320,000 students
enrolled on the 20 campuses of the CSU system, and on January 17, 1995, a
California appeals court ruled that they must pay an additional $5,000 per year
out-of-state tuition, ending the practice since 1985 of charging them in-state
tuition.  This ruling means that all three of California's higher education
systems--University of California, California State University, and community
colleges--charge unauthorized aliens higher out-of-state tuition.  There is as
yet no Prop. 187-type system in place to verify the legal status of California
students.  California institutions of higher learning enroll about 1 in 6
college students in the US.   </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In December 1994, the National Coordinating Committee for Citizenship and
Civic Participation met in Arizona and adopted the Plan de Tucson to boycott
California food, tourism and entertainment industries.  Corporations targeted
include Chevron and Disney, which report no effects on their businesses.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some Mexican officials reportedly fear a return of unauthorized Mexicans
because of Prop. 187.  There is no evidence of such a migration.</tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Fifteen states across the nation are being targeted for Prop.-187 style
measures to deny public services to illegal immigrants.  Florida, with an
estimated 400,000 illegal aliens, is considered ripe for a Prop. 187-type
initiative, primarily because the state allows initiatives.  Texas does not
permit initiatives.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A citizen's group in Florida has begun fundraising and petition drives
aimed at qualifying the measure for the ballot.  In Arizona, AZ-187 Border
Blockade, a Tucson political action committee, is planning to put a Prop.
187-measure on the 1996 ballot.  Arizona Governor Fife Symington was opposed to
California's Prop. 187, and there are currently no immigration control bills in
the Arizona Legislature.  </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Immigration
and Affirmative Action</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Many of the grassroots supporters of Prop. 187 have become vocal supporters
of the California Civil Rights Initiative, an initiative planned for the 1996
ballot that would "prohibit the state or any of its political subdivisions from
using race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as a criterion for either
discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual
or group in the operation of the state's system of public employment , public
education or public contracting."  Governor Wilson lent his support to the
effort to repeal race and sex preferences with an end-of-the-year comment that
he favors ending California's affirmative action laws.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Early polling indicates that the proposal to end preferences based on race
and sex has a 50-50 chance of voter approval even if white women vote against
the initiative.  In one commentary, the same California voters who pioneered
the tax cutting fever of the late 1970s and 1980s are in the 1990s voting for
laws that get tough on criminals with three strikes, get tough on illegal
aliens with Prop. 187, and now get tough on preferences with the California
Civil Rights Initiative.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The California Legislature may attempt to head off the initiative with a
partial repeal of preferences in contracting.  Assemblyman Bernie Richter
(R-Chico) has proposed legislation for a so-called "colorblind society" that
would, inter alia, eliminate race and gender preferences in university
admissions and public employment and end the practice of requiring a certain
percentage of public contracts to be awarded to e.g., women, minorities, or
disabled veterans.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some of the groups that supported Prop. 187 are also challenging the $40
billion aid package for Mexico and arguing that the renamed "America" needs a
"refounding amendment" that would, inter alia, restrict US citizenship to
"those born of an American."  The opposition to Mexican aid links the Prop. 187
groups with Ross Perot's United We Stand organizations.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC13">DOL
Issues H-1B Final Rules</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The final regulations spelling our what US employers wishing to hire
foreign H1-B workers went into effect January 20, 1995.  The US Department of
Labor regulations are designed to prevent US employers from paying below
standard wages to temporary skilled foreign workers.  DOL decided to limit
labor condition applications (LCA) to single occupations, but DOL has not
limited them geographically (e.g., only to areas within the jurisdiction of a
single DOL regional office). </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There is an annual cap of 65,000 H-1B foreign workers with "specialty
occupations"--often engineers or physical therapists who have at least a
bachelor's degree.   In FY 94, DOL approved employer requests for 60,179 H-1B
workers, versus 61,591 in FY 93 and 57,125 in FY 92.  The INS  reports that
there were 110,000 H-1B workers in FY 92, and 93,000 in FY 93, but the INS data
report each entrance of such a worker, so that, e.g., a UK software engineer
who takes a summer vacation in England and then returns to the US is counted
twice in INS data.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The new rules also affect contractors who move H1-B workers from job to
job.  A new "time test" allows employers to shift an H1-B worker to a worksite
not listed on the LCA for 90 days without filing a new LCA.  To stem abuse, DOL
requires that there be no strike at the particular worksite, that the work be
the same for which the approval was granted, and that the off site work be less
than 90 work days over three-years.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Employers of H1-B employees will now be required to notify DOL within three
days if a strike or lockout occurs at particular place of business.  DOL
enforcement powers will be significantly increased, the agency to conduct
investigations on its own initiative instead of waiting for complaints.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Labor groups, especially US software engineers, welcomed the new rules.
But software companies such as Microsoft and Intel and their lawyers complained
that the new rules make it too hard to bring in needed foreign workers.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>In many cases, these "brand-names" American companies use a subcontractor
to supply them with foreign workers, so that they may not know of substandard
wages and conditions.  The Department of Labor decided "at this time" not to
establish special procedures for companies that obtain foreign workers through
contractors.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The new rules reduce the maximum length of a work permit from six to three
years, and require US employers to offer more evidence that they are indeed
paying prevailing wages to foreign workers.  However, most of the employer
application continues to consist of attestations--meaning that the employer
asserts that Americans are not available for the jobs foreigners will fill, and
that the wages and conditions offered are normal for the occupation.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>One of the arguments for the 1990 IMMACT was that the US needed to make it
easier for scientists to immigrate because, according to a National Science
Foundation report, there would soon be a shortage of everything from
biochemists to mathematicians.  Many universities expanded their Ph.D.
programs, and the number of scientists grew almost three times faster than the
labor force as a whole.  There were 402,000 workers in all fields of science in
1992, including 53,000 biomedical scientists.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Real federal funding for scientific research has been frozen at about $57
billion since 1987, and as a result, more newly minted Ph.D.'s are scrambling
for ever fewer secure jobs.  The unemployment rate for scientists, three
percent, is the highest for any US profession, and many new Ph.D.s shuttle from
one $20,000- $35,000 post doctorate to another.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>As US students sought alternative careers, universities filled up their
graduate programs with foreign students.  Today, there are more foreign than US
born post-doctorate scientists, 17,000 versus 16,000, while in 1979, there were
two US-born post-doctorates for every foreign born post doctorate.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreign-born scientists continues to increase.  In 1993, the
Chinese Student Protection Act allowed the 27,000 Chinese students who were in
the US during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre to become immigrants.  Many
are believed to be scientists and engineers.  The US allocates 140,000
immigrant visas annually for needed workers, including scientists, and about 30
percent of the 50,000 to 60,000 immigrant workers admitted--15,000 to 20,000--
are believed to be scientists (the remaining visas are used for family
members).  </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>France, Europe's major country of immigration, has long followed a policy
of encouraging conformity to French values in public.  This has provoked a
series of so-called hidjab or headscarve battles--Muslim women who wear
headscarves have been barred from French schools for wearing "ostentatious"
religious objects.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The headscarves, in turn, reflect the growth of Islamic fundamentalism,
especially among second and third generation North African youth in the suburbs
who have had a hard time finding jobs and careers in high-unemployment France.
In these suburbs, youth allegedly have two choices, both of which make the
French uncomfortable--adopt secular values, and be attracted to drugs and
delinquency, or become devoutly religious, and perhaps be attracted to Islamic
fundamentalism and terrorism.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The estimated three to five million Muslim immigrants in France make Islam
second only to Catholicism in adherents among France's 57 million people.  Many
observers call for compromise, and accommodation is often made for religious
differences, but there are also reports of e.g., Muslim workers being
disciplined for asking for work breaks to pray. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were many laudatory profiles of French Interior Minister Charles
Pasqua after hostages aboard an airplane hijacked in Algeria were released in
southern France.  Pasqua expelled several fundamentalists from France during
the summer of 1994, and he reportedly takes care to cultivate the mainstream
Muslim population in France.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A French writer compared the dissatisfaction of the French and Californians

not, are accused of looting French society by taking advantage of generous
social services, disregarding French values and cultural habits, and raising
the crime rate.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Presidential candidate and National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen has said
he would expel million of immigrants if he won the French presidential

<a name="RTFToC17">German
Citizenship Changes Proposed</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germany's Justice Minister, Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, has called
for a reform of the country's 1913 citizenship law that makes citizenship
dependent on blood rather than place of birth.  The CDU-CSU-FDP coalition that
won the October 1994 election proposed a conditional citizenship for the
children of immigrants who have lived in Germany for at least 10 years--at age
18<b>, </b>the child would have to choose German or his parents'
nationality.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Kohl's Christian Democrats continue the affirm their ardent opposition to
dual nationality or anything that would liberalize current immigration policy.
The proposed bill threatens to drive a wedge between the FDP and the Christian
Democrats (CDU) weakening the center-right coalition government. The proposal
is very close to the position of the FDP, the small party that helps maintain
Kohl's slim 10-seat parliamentary majority. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germany's major opposition party, the Social Democrats (SPD), voted
unanimously on January 24 to offer a nationality bill that would make dual
nationality possible, cut the naturalization period, and automatically grant
citizenship to third-generation immigrants.  The Social Democrats argue that
the bill will help the 6.9 million foreigners integrate better.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Germany's nationality laws are based on blood or decent rather than place
of birth.  The proposed law would entitle children of foreign parents to German
nationality if one parent was born or lives in Germany.  Allowing retention of
another nationality would benefit the 1.8 million Turks.  Some have been
deterred from naturalizing because they feared losing inheritance rights in
Turkey.  The CDU believes that the new law would send the wrong message and
open the flood gates to further migration to Germany.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Of Germany's 80 million population, about 6.5 million are foreign born, and
nearly 60 percent of the foreign-born have lived in Germany for more than 10
years.  Many gained residence rights through the once liberal asylum process.
According to the Interior Ministry, 127,210 foreigners applied for asylum in
1994, compared to 322,599 in 1993 and 438,191 in 1992.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Some 222,600 ethnic German immigrants arrived in Germany in 1994, compared
with 218,900 in 1993 and 230,600 in 1992.  About two-thirds of the immigrants
came from Asian republics such as Kazakhstan, but other ethnic Germans are
re-settling in Russia.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 11, 1995, Germany announced that it would begin to forcibly
repatriate some of the 40,000 Vietnamese illegally in the country, and Vietnam
has agreed to accept them back in exchange for a $130 million aid package and
$65 million in risk insurance for German companies making investments in
Vietnam.  This works out to about $5,000 for each Vietnamese to be sent
home.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There were about 62,000 Vietnamese in East Germany in 1989, and 12,000
stayed despite a German offer of a ticket home plus $2,000.  The 40,000 illegal
Vietnamese include 20,000 rejected asylum seekers.</tt><p>

Rules Asylum Detention Illegal</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Home Secretary Michael Howard is seeking to have overturned a ruling that
asylum seekers cannot be deported from the UK before their claims are heard,
nor can they be detained while their requests are considered.  Immigration
lawyers and Amnesty International are demanding the immediate release of up to
500 immigrants currently being held in custody.  Howard says he will continue
to hold the asylum seekers until the appeals courts tells him to release them.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The ruling was a result of a clause inserted in the Asylum and Immigration
Appeals Act of 1993 which says that no asylum seeker will be sent home until
consideration of his or her request for safe haven has been completed will end
the British practice of detaining illegal aliens and asylum seekers who entered
the UK illegally.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>

Combats Xenophobia</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The advisory committee on racism and xenophobia established by the European
Council in Corfu recommended in an interim report that European schools and
training programs make special efforts to meet the needs of minority youth,
that the media make a special effort to combat racism and xenophobia, and that
EU nations take steps to ensure that "all legal residents ... have equal access
to</tt><p>
<tt>employment and fair treatment from employers."  A final report is expected
in April 1995.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Spain, France and Italy fear influxes of immigrants from Northern Africa,
while Germany worries more about immigrants from Eastern Europe.  At a December
summit meeting in Essen, Germany, EU leaders agreed on a $6.7 billion aid
package for Eastern Europe over the next five years, with the understanding
that the amount might have to be raised later.  The European Commission, the
union's executive body, had recommended $8.5 billion.  Although there was some
discussion of giving the Mediterranean countries roughly half the amount
offered to the East, in the end the summiteers were unable to settle on a
figure.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Council, the European Commission, and a delegation of the Forum of
Immigrants of the EU on January 30 discussed asylum and refugee requests,
freedom of movement, reuniting of families and visitation rights, the right
work in another member state, and racial discrimination and citizenship.  The
Forum asked the EU to allow immigrants living illegally in the Union for more
than three years to be allowed to legalize their situation under a general
amnesty. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>France holds the presidency of the EU in the first six months of 1995,
followed by Spain and Italy at the start of 1996.  This is expected to
highlight the problems of immigration into southern Europe.  The European
Commission is committed to giving both direct aid and wider market access to
North Africa.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Spain's EU development commissioner, Manuel Martin, has said that the EU
should consider how to deal with immigration and drug trafficking, but it is
unclear whether African countries will agree to try to halt emigration and drug
trafficking in return for aid. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There is also some dispute about the type of aid to be given.  Germany and
Britain prefer trade concessions over aid.  One the other hand, Southern
Europeans prefer aid to trade, since they fear their economies would be hurt if
cheaper textiles and agricultural products. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC20">Dutch
Amnesty</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On January 31, 1995, the Dutch Senate was expected to decide whether to
adopt a controversial amendment taht would prevent persons from applying for
asylum if they entered the Netherlands via a safe third country.  If approved,
asylum seekers entering the Netherlands from Germany, Belgium or another safe
country would be deported back to that country.  The amendment was narrowly
approved by the lower house of Parliament in December.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The bill is opposed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
and Amnesty International because they feel it would make it difficult to
protect asylum seekers.  The Dutch Refugee Council estimates that, under the
proposed law, as many as 40 percent of all new asylum seekers would not be
allowed to apply. The Netherlands received about 55,000 requests for asylum in
1994. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Beginning January 1, 1995, illegal immigrants in the Netherlands who can
prove they have had legal work continuously for at least six years, paying both
tax and social premiums, are entitled to an official residence permit.  The
amnesty will continue until January 1, 1999.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC21">Alien
Smuggling in Europe</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Migrant trafficking is believed to be a billion dollar business in Western
Europe, as smugglers who once smuggled drugs now sneak an estimated 500,000
illegal aliens into Europe for fees that range from $250 to $25,000 each.
Smuggling foreign workers is both more profitable and less risky--in the
Netherlands, for example, alien smuggling became a crime only in January 1994,
and is punishable by a maximum of one year in prison.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are both supply and demand reasons for the surge in migrant
trafficking.  War and poverty, plus knowledge of opportunities abroad,
encourage migrants to seek jobs abroad.  At the same time, there are
opportunities to earn 10 or 20 times more in Europe than at home.  Border
control officers complain that, even if they think they know who is smuggling
aliens, arrests can be made only when smugglers are caught with aliens, and
smuggling is not always considered a serious crime because, within the EU,
there is no consensus on whether to treat migrants being smuggled into Europe
as criminals or victims.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>

Portugal-- and two north African nations--Algeria and Tunisia-- met in Tunis

<a name="RTFToC24">Chinese
Migration</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China is hoping to expand its labor exports to find jobs for its estimated
120 to 125 million unemployed rural workers.  Beginning in the 1950s as
"foreign labor cooperation," China has sent workers abroad to complete 1,000
projects in 70 countries, most notably the railroad between Tanzania and
Zambia.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>After economic reforms in 1978, China began to promote the export of labor
as a means to earn foreign exchange and to ease domestic unemployment.  Three
major types of government entities--national government corporations, local
government companies, and trading companies--and today there are 130,000 to
200,000 Chinese workers abroad, mostly in Asia.  The Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, which reports 200,000 migrant workers were abroad in
1994, estimated that remittances and earnings from Chinese-supplied materials
used in foreign projects generated $8 billion for China in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are two major arrangements under which Chinese workers are employed
abroad.  Labor service agreements, most often made by one of the 61 local
government companies, sent 68,000 workers abroad in 1991.  Contract-tied
workers, most often employed by one of the 56 national government corporations
that have a contract to build e.g., a dam or bridge abroad, sent 21,500 workers
abroad in 1991.  There are reportedly 30,000 Chinese workers employed to build
Hong Kong's new airport and to work in construction there.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are also Chinese "worker-trainees" in Japan, ex-USSR, and the US,
Chinese farmers in Japan, and 10,000 Chinese workers in South Korea.  China is
asking Japanese and Korean construction firms to consider using Chinese workers
when they win jobs in third countries, such as the Gulf states.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Over half of all Chinese workers come from 10 of China's 30
provinces--about 20 percent come from the South China provinces of Guandong and
Fujian.  These provinces are among the fastest growing in China, and they are
the preferred destination for some of the 60 million Chinese who re-settle
every year within China, and the 20 million who migrate to seasonal jobs within
the country.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China has 1.2 billion people, 80 percent of whom live in rural areas.
Despite an economy that expanded by 12 percent in 1994 to about $520 billion,
and $35 billion in direct foreign investment in 1994, second only to foreign
investment in the US, there are an estimated 150 million surplus workers in
rural areas, and 15 to 20 million un- or underemployed workers in urban areas.
By 2010, even if the population remains at 1.2 billion, it is predicted that
half of the country's people will live in urban areas, implying a massive
rural-urban migration and large cities.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Relatively better conditions in the urban areas of the country--industry
expanded by 18 percent in 1994, versus four percent for agriculture--accentuate
inequalities that promote rural-urban migration.  There are an estimated 50 to
60 million internal migrants within China.  They are described as so-called
'mangliu' ('blind migrants'), since they gather at railroad stations looking
for jobs and fellow villagers, much as southern European guestworkers did
France and Germany in the 1960s.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>These internal migrants have rapidly made for themselves a place in local
economies, but they also threaten social unrest.  For example, most of
Beijing's 800,000 construction workers are reportedly internal migrants, but
these migrants are also 43 percent of the convicted criminals in Beijing.
Migrants also dominate occupations such as maid, peddler, and food-stall
operator.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Chinese government is trying to manage rural-urban migration by
limiting the employment of rural migrants in urban factories and expanding
labor exports abroad.  As China relaxes the household registration system, some
cities have begun to tax newcomers for the right to change their registration
from rural to urban, thereby making available to them the permits they need to
get local government housing.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Year of the Boar, which begins January 31, 1995, is expected to see
millions of internal migrants return to their villages with gifts--last year,
almost one in six Chinese traveled by rail in the two months of the lunar New
Year.  China hopes in 1995 to keep 60 percent of the internal migrants at their
workplaces to avoid overloading the transportation system by encouraging
employers to offer overtime and bonuses, and prohibiting them from hiring new
migrant workers until 30 days after the holiday season.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China is planning a national campaign at the start of 1997 to help prevent
a mass influx of mainlanders into Hong Kong after the sovereignty handover.
The current  entry procedure for mainlanders to visit and stay in Hong Kong
would be kept intact after 1997.  Currently, 105 immigrant visas are issued
each day for mainland immigrants to Hong Kong.  There are reports that
mainlanders are asked to pay up to $300,000(HK) for these permits.</tt><p>

Foreign Workers</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is a fast growing country of 20 million people that both exports
and imports labor.  It has one of the highest immigrant worker shares in the
region--an estimated one million foreigners in a workforce of about eight
million, and persisting employer complaints of labor shortages.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers in Malaysia include over 61,000 professionals or
expatriates who earn at least R1200 ($500 ) per month.  There were also 563,000
unskilled and semi-skilled foreigners with Temporary Visit Work Passes in
September 1994.  Over half of these foreign workers, who receive two-year work
permits that are renewable for one year-- were in the Kuala Lumpur area, and
about 30 percent were employed on plantations, 30 percent in construction, and
20 percent as maids.  For the 340,000 legal foreign workers for whom country of
origin data are available, two-thirds are Indonesians, followed by 20 percent
Bangladeshis.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Beginning in 1993, Malaysian employers were required to pay an annual levy
on each foreign legal worker.  The levy varies from about $120 for plantation
workers to $170 for construction workers and $350 for skilled service workers.
Since April 1993, there has been a freeze on employer applications to bring
additional foreign workers to Malaysia, but a cabinet-level Task Force
considers and approves applications for foreign workers on a case-by-case
basis.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is attempting to rapidly upgrade its economy, thereby eliminating
jobs that might be filled by unskilled workers.  Malaysia's Sixth Five year
plan projects shortages of skilled and surpluses of unskilled workers by 2000.
The Malaysian government has asked private employers to do more to train the
skilled workers expected to be in short supply.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia is now trying to attract overseas investors with tax and other
incentives, but is choosy about the type of industry allowed in the country.
The government is aiming for capital-intensive projects such as semi-conductor
manufacturing. </tt><p>

will be investigating workers from Myanmar (formerly Burma) in the Thai fish,
construction and husbandry industries.  Along the Myanmar-Thai border, nearly
all the workers are from Myanmar migrants. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Over the past two years there has been a noticeable increase in the number
of Hong Kong citizens returning to Hong Kong after emigrating to Canada.  Some
of the reasons for returning include lack of servants, job shortages, high
taxes, and separation from friends and relatives.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Emigration from Canada, usually after the immigrant has obtained Canadian
citizenship, is estimated at about 15 per cent.  Increasingly, Hong Kong
citizens are emigrating to Australia, London, Singapore, and Europe.  Hong Kong
has been losing 60,000 people per year, or about one percent of the population.
</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The brain drain of middle level management worries the government in Hong
Kong.  The British offer of citizenship to 50,000 families -- which could mean
250,000 people -- may be the first immigration scheme in history aimed at
keeping people in their homeland rather than helping them leave.  The theory is
that once a Hong Kong resident gets British citizenship, he or she will feel
secure enough not to leave.  Foreign citizenships are being offered to people
Hong Kong least wants to lose, such as mid-level managers, business
entrepreneurs, those with vital skills, such as air traffic controllers, and
people with "sensitive jobs," such as police chiefs.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>A judge in Hong Kong has ruled that the government is guilty of illegal
detention of Vietnamese boat people.  At least 125 boat people could be
released following the January 26 ruling that long periods of detention in
camps without prospect of repatriation was unlawful--14 Vietnamese detainees
were freed after five years in detention by this ruling.  </tt><p>

Steps Up Anti-Smuggling Efforts</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan announced plans to begin checking the passports of arriving foreign
workers more carefully to detect forged passports and work visas as part of a
stepped up effort to deal with the estimated 20,000 illegal foreign workers on
the island.  The government also announced plans to begin imposing criminal
penalties on employers of illegal workers, and plans to introduce sanctions of
three years or fines of Taiwan $15 million (US$ 577,000) on operators of
Taiwanese boats and aircraft were caught smuggling Chinese immigrants to Taiwan
and other countries.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan plans to require foreign workers to deposit 30 percent of their
wages in savings accounts that pay interest, but workers only get their savings
if they abide by their contracts.  Taiwan is also planning to extend from three
to four years the maximum stay of foreign workers, and to establish an
early-warning system that would warn of "overreliance on foreign workers,"
defined as so many foreign workers that the upgrading of the manufacturing
capability of Taiwan's enterprises is hindered.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan announced that workers from mainland China would not be allowed into
Taiwan until the Beijing regime abandons its hostility to Taiwan.</tt><p>

People to Australia</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Australia is expecting an influx of as many as 5,000 boat people, according
to a worst-case scenario by the Department of Immigration.  Australia's
detention camps are already full, with 1,000 boat people who arrived in 1994.
The President of the Indochina Refugee Association indicates that the
Australian government does not have much confidence in talks with China on how
to stem the flow. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Over 700 persons repatriated from Hong Kong to China have turned up on the
northern shores of Australia since mid-November.  Most are Vietnamese who fled
Vietnam fearing persecution and were granted asylum in China in 1979. With the
assistance of the United Nations they set up homes in Beihai and are now
leaving in boats for Darwin.  In Australia, most requested asylum on the basis
of China's one-child policy.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>China has told the Australian government that it is under no obligation to
take back the Vietnamese-Chinese boat people.  The Chinese blame the exodus on
the Australian government decision to grant refugee status to former Vietnamese
refugees in 1994. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Australia places those who arrived in detention camps.  The UNHCR endorsed
Australia's warning that these boat people would not be granted asylum.  China
announced that the one-child policy does not apply to ethnic minorities or
refugees such as Vietnamese and Laotians granted refuge in China, and Chinese
police are reportedly arresting persons attempting illegal emigration and
confiscating their boats.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Legislation will be proposed in the Australian Senate to make it more
difficult for the boat people to seek refugee status.  The legislation has been
announced to send a message back to Beihai, that the chances of successfully
finding refuge in Australia are poor. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC32">Migrants
to South Africa</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Africans--from Zambia, Angola, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe--are migrating to
South Africa.  The African National Congress-dominated coalition government,
facing elections in October 1995, is under pressure from mainly black trade
unions and workers to step up border controls in order protect jobs for local
workers. The ANC wants to avoid alienating neighbors who harbored its
guerrillas during the struggle against apartheid.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The South African government today uses random ID checks and raids on
suspected ''safe houses'' to detect and deter illegal immigrants.  According to
one survey, most South Africans favor even more immigration controls.  A recent
survey reported that a majority believed that illegal aliens should be rounded
up and deported.  However, many of those apprehended say they will try to
return, since the wage gap between South Africa and Mozambique is 10 or 15 to
1.  The main rail station in Johannesburg serves as South Africa's major day
labor market.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>There are believed to be two million aliens in South Africa.  About 53,000
aliens were expelled in 1990, 97,000 in 1993, and well over 100,000 in 1994.

<a name="RTFToC33">Fiji
Opens Door to Chinese Business Migrants</a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>After the 1987 coup in Fiji, more than 24,000 Indian Fijians left the
country fearing persecution.  The Fijian government is now inviting Chinese
business migrants to come to Fiji to fill the void left by the Indian
professionals and entrepreneurs who left.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Fijian Cabinet approved a proposal to allow up to 7,000 Chinese
businessman and their families from Hong Kong to migrate to Fiji, provided they
pay an application fee of $30,000 and invest at least $100,000 in
government-approved projects.  The government says the program will bring in up
to $ 2.5 billion in investments and create some 80,000 jobs.  The Chinese are
expected to be heavily involved in repacking and refining import commodities
for re-export.</tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The 1990 constitution favors indigenous Polynesians over Indians, who make
up nearly half of Fiji's 770,000 people.  It bars non-natives from becoming
president or premier, and reserves 37 parliamentary seats for indigenous
Fijians, 27 for Indians, and five for other groups under the General Voters
category. </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Current estimates are that there are about 5,000 Chinese in Fiji.  While a
few settled in the islands a century ago, some 1,000 Chinese, have come to do
business in Fiji in the last few years. More than 900 work permits have been
issued to Chinese nationals since 1987, and the Fiji Trade and Investment Board
says there are nearly 60 Chinese running joint ventures in Fiji.  </tt><p>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>Official figures show that between 1987 and June 1993, Fiji granted
citizenship to 508 Chinese.  During the same period, 24,014 Indians left the
country for Australia, New Zealand and Canada.</tt><p>
