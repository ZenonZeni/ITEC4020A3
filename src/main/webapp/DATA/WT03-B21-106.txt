<H3>The Fallopian Tube</H3>
<P>
The fallopian tube has the complex task of ensuring the transport  of spermatozoa towards the ovary, and of ova towards the uterus. In addition, it supports the changes in the gametes which lead to fertilization, embryo cleavage and transport of the zygote towards the normal site of implantation in the uterine endometrium. The fallopian tube is far more than just a conduit between the ovaries and the uterus; its finger-like ciliated cells that line the tubal lumen must be healthy in order to assist sperm in their migration toward the ovum, and, if conception occurs, to reverse the direction of movement to propel the newly-fertilized ovum toward the uterus. In addition, the secretory cells must be functioning to create the chemical environment necessary to achieve fertilization.
<P>
The fallopian tubes are delicate and difficult to access because they are very narrow, tortuous and convoluted in shape.   As a result, they do not lend themselves to easy study and treatment. Because of the difficulty in accessing the fallopian tubes, current non-surgical techniques for diagnosing fallopian tube diseases and disorders often do not adequately or accurately delineate the nature, extent and location of tubal pathology. Therapeutic choices for the treatment of infertility are equally constrained by the difficulty in accessing the fallopian tubes, and therefore, most fallopian tube therapies must be performed surgically.

		<H3>Tubal Factor Infertility</H3>
<P>
Human reproductive diseases and disorders are increasingly common medical problems in most developed countries. Infertility is one of the most common and emotionally traumatic of reproductive disorders. In most countries, female infertility appears to be increasing, both because of the increase in diseases which damage the fallopian tubes, such as sexually transmitted diseases, and because of the increasing tendency of women to defer child-bearing until later in life, when fertility begins to decline naturally. Studies indicate that approximately five to eight million couples in the United States or up to 15% of couples of child-bearing age (20-44) are clinically infertile.
