<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Assessing Student Motivation Orientation<BR>and its Effect on Learning Behaviors</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Developed by <A HREF="../Students#SB">Susan Braen</A></FONT><BR>
<HR> 
Pintrich and De Groot (1990) studied the interaction between a student's motivation orientation and his or her employment of various self-regulated learning components. They indicate that there are three different components of self-regulated learning:
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> an expectancy component, which includes students' beliefs about their ability to perform a task,<BR>
<BR>
<LI> a value component, which includes students' goals and beliefs about the importance and interest of the task, and<BR>
<BR>
<LI> an affective component, which includes students' emotional reactions to the task (p. 33). (4)
</OL>
The expectancy component is concerned with the student's asking, "Can I do this task?"  Do students believe that they can do the task and are they responsible for their own performance.  The value component is concerned with the students' goals for the  task (mastery or performance) and their beliefs about the importance of the task.  With respect to value, students ask, "Why am I doing this task?" The motivational component is concerned with the affective or emotional reactions to the task, including test anxiety.  Students ask, "How do I feel about this task?"<BR>
<BR>
Pintrich and De Groot found that the intrinsic value of the material to the student and a belief that the school work was interesting and important resulted in greater cognitive engagement. The ability to utilize learning strategies was tied to performance. However, the students who were more likely to be self-regulating and to persist in their academic efforts were those who were intrinsically motivated to learn the material rather than just trying to get a good grade (p. 37).<BR>
<BR>
Material that is interesting or perceived to be meaningful to students seems to lead to greater cognitive engagement and students who value the learning have a greater interest in the task. They will utilize more metacognitive strategies in order to be successful. As the research of Pintrich and De Groot indicates, students require both the "will" and the "skill" in order to succeed with learning tasks.<BR>
<BR>
Nicholls, Patashnick, and Nolen (1985) researched whether there was any relationship between adolescents' views about the purposes of education, their beliefs about the causes of academic success, and their personal goals. They asked whether education seen was an end in itself, a component of becoming a responsible and knowledgeable adult, or as a way to gain wealth and status. Their hypothesis was that motivation to master and understand rather than belief that purpose was to get wealth should result in stronger personal commitment to learning. (5)<BR>
<BR>
Nicholls et al. analyzed student responses to questionnaires as to what the students thought to be the purposes of schooling (wealth and status, commitment to society, understanding the world, and achievement motivation) with their personal goals in school, satisfaction with school learning, perceived causes of success, and their perceived ability.<BR>
<BR>
Avoidance of work behavior (choose easier task that can be done quickly and try to gain favor) was highly correlated with the belief that the purpose of education was to get wealth and status.  Students with work avoidance behaviors also believed that success was more related more to luck than effort. Also status seeking students believed that success meant surpassing others.  Their success demanded another's failure. They had less satisfaction with school and little interest or plans for attending college.<BR>
<BR>
Students with a task orientation who believed that learning was integral to their future lives had greater sense of satisfaction with school. They tried harder to understand material and worked collaboratively. They also saw the teacher as a person rather than as a means to an end. They also had plans to go to college.<BR>
<BR>
Causal relations for the two different groups of students were consistent with their beliefs. According to Nicholls et al. (1985), "students who are inclined to feel successful when they do well without effort...are more likely to believe that students succeed when they know how to impress people and act as if they like the teacher" (p. 691). They do not see effort and interest in learning as necessary for success in school. Students who seek to understand and to learn believe that they can succeed if they work hard. They note that the correlation is interesting and in keeping with world view. They suggest that promoting the idea that the purpose of schooling is to get a good job should be discouraged. Emphasizing socioeconomic goals for students may be counterproductive and require value reexamination.<BR>

Meece, Blumenfeld, and Hoyle (1988) studied fifth and sixth grade pupils comparing their perceptions of academic competence, their intrinsic motivation, and their goal orientation. In this study, the students who showed greater intrinsic motivation had a  stronger interest in task mastery than students with less interest. They were, according to Meece et al., "oriented toward gaining recognition, pleasing the teacher, or minimizing effort as much as possible" (p. 521).<BR>
<BR>
Graham and Golan (1991) compared motivation with recall.  Fifth and sixth graders were given a puzzle to do for a few minutes. Then they were presented with a learning task. However some of the students were told that the task was fun and challenging and that one got better at it as it went along.  Others were told that their performance would be about the same as on the puzzle. Some people were better at it than others. They found that the students who were led to believe that they could master the task were more successful in the follow-up test.  Clearly, student beliefs influence classroom behavior. The ego-focused context had "detrimental consequences for performance" (Graham & Golan, 1991, p. 193).  In contrast, "a mastery goal orientation...promotes a motivational pattern likely to promote long-term and high quality involvement in learning" (Ames, 1992, p. 263).<BR>
