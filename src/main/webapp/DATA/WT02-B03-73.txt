<title>Resolving Transportation Problems</title>
</head>

<body>
<IMG SRC="tips.gif">
<BR>
You want your transportation  to be safe whether you travel by your personal car or by public or
private transportation. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) makes every effort to
assure that transportation is safe and secure. <p>

Each agency within the Department has regulatory jurisdiction over issues that affect consumers
rather than individuals. In many cases when we are unable to resolve your complaint, we can
still help. We collect complaints from people like you. When a widespread problem clearly
exists, we can investigate, initiate a recall campaign (if the problem in a motor vehicle is a safety
defect), or revise a safety standard affecting the industry. <p>

In a complaint about airline service or a motor vehicle, we provide the carrier or manufacturer
with a copy of the complaint. When we send the complaints to the company, it may result in a
satisfactory solution of individual problems. So, if you have a complaint about any mode of
transportation, you can contact DOT by calling the numbers on the back of this fact sheet. <p>

DOT encourages you to attempt to resolve your complaint and here are some tips to help you
resolve your problem:<p>

<ul>
  <li>Always start with the business that sold the item, performed the service, or agreed to
      perform the service. Most companies include instructions for resolving a problem on
      their paperwork. The instructions may include a telephone number (usually an 800
      number), a mailing address, and a statement that you must write and telephone the
      company. Follow the company's instructions. Calmly and accurately describe the
      complaint. State clearly what you consider a fair resolution.  </li><P>

  <li>Keep a file of all paperwork relating to your purchase or service. Your file should
      include copies of tickets, sales receipts, repair orders, warranties, cancelled checks,
      contracts, and all correspondence relating to the problem. (Keep the originals of all
      paperwork and copies of all letters you send.) </li><P>

  <li>Keep a record of your efforts to solve the problem. Your log should include dates and
      times, the person(s) you talked to, what was promised, and what was done.</li><P>

  <li>Contact the company's headquarters. If you have followed the company's procedures to
      resolve the complaint and have not obtained a satisfactory resolution, contact the
      company's headquarters. Many companies have an 800 number. You may find it on their
      official documents, the product, a directory of companies available in a library, or by
      calling 1-800-555-1212. When talking to the official, be sure to relate your previous
      efforts to resolve the problem. Follow up your phone conversation with a letter addressed
      to the president of the company (or the consumer affairs office). Keep a copy of this
      letter in your file.   </li><P>

  <li><b>Include your name, address, and phone numbers in all correspondence. </b>This
      information makes it easier for the company to respond to you. If you send any
      paperwork, always enclose a photocopy. If your paperwork includes an order number or
      customer identification number, be sure to include it in the letter.</li><P>

  <li><b>Seek help from local and state agencies.</b> If you are still unable to resolve your
      complaint, contact your local or state consumer protection office, the city, county, or
      state's attorney for additional help.</li><P>
</ul>
<p>

Again, we greatly appreciate the information you provide the U.S. Department of
Transportation.  You, our consumer, are one of  DOT's most valuable assets. <p>
