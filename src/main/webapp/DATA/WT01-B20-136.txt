<H1>In Memoriam</H1>

We deeply regret to announce that Nikolai K. Lemeshev passed away on January 25, 1995, while working in his office. Dr. Lemeshev was Head of the Department of Industrial Crops and Curator of the germplasm collections of fiber and oil crops at the N.I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry in St. Petersburg, Russia. Nikolai will be sorely missed by his family, friends, and colleagues, including all of us at the IHA. His commitment to preservation of the VIR <I>Cannabis</I> collection was ardent and unwavering.
