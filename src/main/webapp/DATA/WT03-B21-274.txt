<FONT SIZE=6>There
 are 
some 
2,800 
hydropower 
facilities 
in 
the 
U.S. 
totalling
more 
than 
 72,000
 MW 
in 
electric capacity, serving nearly 30
million people. Roughly 1,600 of these sites are small-scale hydro
plants with a total production capacity of 7,100 megawatts (MW),
generating enough electricity for several million
  people.

According to a 1988 federal survey, there are enough undeveloped
river sites to nearly double hydro capacity, including nearly 5,000
potential small-scale sites which could produce an additional
22,000 MW. However, a federal inter-laboratory review found economic,
                                 environmental and regulatory constraints that
                                 are likely to limit new hydro development (large
                                 and small) to only 8,000 MW by 2030. Removal
                                 of some constraints could increase this figure to
                                 16,000 MW.

Hydropower systems are loosely classified by power output
capabilities. Small-scale hydropower is broadly defined as any
system generating under 30,000 kiloWatts (kW). It is sometimes
divided into three categories: small, mini, and micro. Small hydropower
                       systems operate much like large-scale systems, but with
                       a smaller output capacity between 1,500 kW and 30,000
                       kW, which can be enough power to meet the electricity
                       of a small town.

Mini-hydropower systems generate between 100 kW and 1,500 kW.
Micro-hydro systems generate up to 100 kW. A private residence
may require between 7 and 10 kW during peak load (when many
devices are being used simultaneously).

Head (or fall) and water flow are the two key variables which
determine the hydro system most suitable for a site. The head
refers to the height of the falling water from the headwater (above
the drop) to the tailwater (below the drop). Head is usually measured in
                      meters or feet. This falling action exerts pressure which
                      converts the kinetic energy in the water into useful
                      mechanical energy by rotating a turbine shaft.

Two-thirds of all hydropower installations are "run of the river"
sites which depend entirely on the water source's constant flow to
meet peak power needs. Dams or diversion structures are typically
required for larger installations. Dams serve two hydro purposes (in
                              addition to non-hydro purposes like flood control,
                              irrigation or recreation). They store water when
                              only a small amount of energy is required. When
                              there is not enough water to produce electricity
                              during peak hours, stored water supplied by dams
                              provides extra power. Dams also can be used to
increase head in sites which do not meet head requirements.

A river or stream is channeled through turbines connected to
electric generators to produce power. The power produced by the
hydropower system is the product of three parameters: 
<DD><LI> the
difference in elevation between the intake and the outlet; 
<DD><LI> the volume of
                              the flow of water; 
<DD><LI> the efficiency of the
                              turbine/generator equipment. The interactive
                              exercise lets you explore varying these parameters,
which change the output of electricity (to try the exercise click the
waterwheel icon in the upper right corner of this screen).

For an estimate of the power available in a given stream or river,
the following formula may be used: 
<DD><FONT SIZE=6> P = 10 x Q x H x efficiency</FONT>
<DD>Power = 10 x flow x fall x
efficiency where "power" is measured in kilowatts, "flow" in cubic
                                meters per second, and "fall" in meters.
                                Efficiency includes that of the turbines and the
generators. Friction losses in the system are usually factored into the
equation by decreasing the "fall" variable by an appropriate amount.

Hydropower plants are designed to use only part of the total water
flow under normal operating conditions. The reserve flow is the
portion of the flow not normally used to maintain minimum stream
flows for environmental reasons.

The installation of a hydropower facility disrupts the flow of a river
and forms an obstacle to the free circulation of aquatic fauna,
particularly to salmon which periodically come to spawn in the
upper reaches of rivers. One solution has been creating fish ladders and
                                      maintaining a permanent reserve flow
                                      between the intake and the tailrace.

Small-scale hydropower provided 1,055 trillion Joules of energy in
Hawaii in 1992, about one-third of one percent of the state's total
energy consumption. There are 20 hydropower plants located on
the Islands of Hawaii, Kauai, and Maui. Seven small-scale plants, ranging
                        in size from 500 kilowatts (kW) to 3,700 kW are located
                        on Kauai, operated by four different sugar companies.
                        In 1992 these hydropower plants supplied 11 percent of
                        Kauai's electricity needs. Four hydropower plants are
                        operated on Maui by two sugar companies. These plants
                        furnished approximately 2 percent of Maui's electrical
                        needs in 1992.

A 12,000 kW hydropower plant, the largest in Hawaii, began
operation on Wailuku Stream in 1993. It generates about 34
million kWh of electricity annually, enough to power 11,000 homes
and replace 83,000 barrels of imported oil. A diversion channel was dug to
                             feed three miles of 5-foot diameter pipe (penstock)
                             with rushing water for the plant's two turbines.

In the State of Maine, the private utility, Central Maine Power,
delivers electricity generated by 55 small-scale hydropower plants.
The hydro facilities range from the 15 kiloWatt (kW) Sevey hydro
site in Ripley, to the 17,150 kW Hydro-Kennebec plant in Winslow.

Total installed capacity worldwide of small hydropower facilities
by the late 1980s was 23,500,000 kW, 38 percent of which was
generated in China. As of the beginning of the 1990s, international
surveys on small-scale hydropower facilities (with capacities below 10,000
               kW) found plants are currently under construction or are
               being planned in 100 countries.

The potential for additional small-scale hydropower (up to 2,000
kW) is on the order of 570 trillion kWh per year, or just under 4
percent of the world's total technical hydropower potential.
Small-scale hydro projects have proven to be very cost-effective energy
                  sources, and represent some of the lowest cost power in the
                  U.S. and in many developing countries.

Of the numerous factors which affect the cost of small hydropower,
site selection and basic layout are among the first which must be
considered if operational and maintenance problems encountered
during the life of a project are to be minimized. Such problems contribute
                                    to recurring costs of a project and could
                                    discourage future developments. The
                                    topography must be suitable for hydropower
                                    generation.

Hydro projects with dams can provide better control of electricity
flow throughout the year, like satisfying peak electrical demands
even during periods of low stream or river flow. This improved
performance needs to be evaluated against the dam's additional expense of
                       construction and maintenance.

Although non-polluting, hydropower presents environmental
concerns which must be investigated before a system is installed.
Hydropower systems can obstruct fish migration paths, creating
problems with fish populations. Often during spawning season, schools of
                          fish swim through a site and are killed by the rotating
                          turbine. For example, in the northwest U.S., large
                          portions of the salmon population have been
                          decimated by the combined impact of hydropower
                          facilities, agriculture, fishing and industrial activities
                          on the flow and quality of the water. There are,
                          however, ways to divert the fish away from the
turbine.

A hydropower system may possess other features which offer much
more than just electricity or mechanical energy. Hydropower sites
often offer means for irrigation, fire control, drinking water, and
                        recreational fishing and boating. Total costs of all
                        services provided by the water in some sites may be less
                        than the cost of purchasing each service separately.
