<h2 align=center>Biological Pollutants in Your Home </h2>

<p>Prepared by: 
<br><b>CPSC</b> and 
<br><b>American Lung Association</b> <i>The Christmas Seal People</i> </p>

<p>
<hr></p>

<p>This booklet will help you understand 1) what indoor biological pollution
is, 2) whether your home or lifestyle promotes its development, and 3)
how to control its growth and buildup. </p>

<p>Outdoor air pollution in cities is a major health problem. Much effort
and money continues to be spent cleaning up pollution in the outdoor air.
But air pollution can be a problem where you least expect it, in the place
you may have thought was safest--your home. Many ordinary activities such
as cooking, heating, cooling, cleaning, and redecorating can cause the
release and spread of indoor pollutants at home. Studies have shown that
the air in our homes can be even more polluted than outdoor air. </p>

<p>Many Americans spend up to 90 percent of their time indoors, often at
home. Therefore, breathing clean indoor air can have an important impact
on health. People who are inside a great deal may be at greater risk of
developing health problems, or having problems made worse by indoor air
pollutants. These people include infants, young children, the elderly,
and those with chronic illnesses. </p>

<h3>What Are Biological Pollutants?</h3>

<p>Biological pollutants are or were living organisms. They promote poor
indoor air quality and may be a major cause of days lost from work or school,
and of doctor and hospital visits. Some can even damage surfaces inside
and outside your house. Biological pollutants can travel through the air
and are often invisible. </p>

<p>Some common indoor biological pollutants are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Animal Dander (minute scales from hair, feathers, or skin) </li>

<li>Dust Mite and Cockroach parts </li>

<li>Fungi (Molds) </li>

<li>Infectious agents (bacteria or viruses) </li>

<li>Pollen </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these substances are in every home. It is impossible to get
rid of them all. Even a spotless home may permit the growth of biological
pollutants. Two conditions are essential to support biological growth:
nutrients and moisture. These conditions can be found in many locations,
such as bathrooms, damp or flooded basements, wet appliances (such as humidifiers
or air conditioners), and even some carpets and furniture. </p>

<p>Modern materials and construction techniques may reduce the amount of
outside air brought into buildings which may result in high moisture levels
inside. Using humidifiers, unvented heaters, and air conditioners in our
homes has increased the chances of moisture forming on interior surfaces.
This encourages the growth of certain biological pollutants. </p>

<h3>The Scope Of The Problem</h3>

<p>Most information about sources and health effects of biological pollutants
is based on studies of large office buildings and two surveys of homes
in northern U.S. and Canada. These surveys show that 30% to 50% of all
structures have damp conditions which may encourage the growth and buildup
of biological pollutants. This percentage is likely to be higher in warm,
moist climates. </p>

<p>Some diseases or illnesses have been linked with biological pollutants
in the indoor environment. However, many of them also have causes unrelated
to the indoor environment. Therefore, we do not know how many health problems
relate only to poor indoor air. </p>

<h3>Health Effects Of Biological Pollutants</h3>

<p>All of us are exposed to biological pollutants. However, the effects
on our health depend upon the type and amount of biological pollution and
the individual person. Some people do not experience health reactions from
certain biological pollutants, while others may experience one or more
of the following reactions: </p>

<ul>
<li>Allergic </li>

<li>Infectious </li>

<li>Toxic </li>
</ul>

<p>Except for the spread of infections indoors, <b>ALLERGIC REACTIONS</b>
may be the most common health problem with indoor air quality in homes.
They are often connected with animal dander (mostly from cats and dogs),
with house dust mites (microscopic animals living in household dust), and
with pollen. Allergic reactions can range from mildly uncomfortable to
life-threatening, as in a severe asthma attack. Some common signs and symptoms
are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Watery eyes </li>

<li>Runny nose and sneezing </li>

<li>Nasal congestion </li>

<li>Itching </li>

<li>Coughing </li>

<li>Wheezing and difficulty breathing </li>

<li>Headache </li>

<li>Fatigue </li>
</ul>

<p>Health experts are especially concerned about people with asthma. These
people have very sensitive airways that can react to various irritants,
making breathing difficult. The number of people who have asthma has greatly
increased in recent years. The number of people with asthma has gone up
by 59 percent since 1970, to a total of 9.6 million people. Asthma in children
under 15 years of age has increased 41 percent in the same period, to a
total of 2.6 million children. The number of deaths from asthma is up by
68 percent since 1979, to a total of almost 4,400 deaths per year. </p>

<p><b>INFECTIOUS DISEASES</b> caused by bacteria and viruses, such as flu,
measles, chicken pox, and tuberculosis, may be spread indoors. Most infectious
diseases pass from person to person through physical contact. Crowded conditions
with poor air circulation can promote this spread. Some bacteria and viruses
thrive in buildings and circulate through indoor ventilation systems. For
example, the bacterium causing Legionnaire's disease, a serious and sometimes
lethal infection, and Pontiac Fever, a flu-like illness, have circulated
in some large buildings. </p>

<h3>Talking To Your Doctor </h3>

<p>Are you concerned about the effects on your health that may be related
to biological pollutants in your home? Before you discuss your concerns
with your doctor, you should know the answers to the following questions.
This information can help the doctor determine whether your health problems
may be related to biological pollution. </p>

<ul>
<li>Does anyone in the family have frequent headaches, fevers, itchy watery
eyes, a stuffy nose, dry throat, or a cough? Does anyone complain of feeling
tired or dizzy all the time? Is anyone wheezing or having difficulties
breathing on a regular basis? </li>

<li>Did these symptoms appear after you moved to a new or different home?
</li>

<li>Do the symptoms disappear when you go to school or the office or go
away on a trip, and return when you come back? </li>

<li>Have you recently remodelled your home or done any energy conservation
work, such as installing insulation, storm windows, or weather stripping?
Did your symptoms occur during or after these activities? </li>

<li>Does your home feel humid? Can you see moisture on the windows or on
other surfaces, such as walls and ceilings? </li>

<li>What is the usual temperature in your home? Is it very hot or cold?
</li>

<li>Have you recently had water damage? </li>

<li>Is your basement wet or damp? </li>

<li>Is there any obvious mold or mildew? </li>

<li>Does any part of your home have a musty or moldy odor? </li>

<li>Is the air stale? </li>

<li>Do you have pets? </li>

<li>Do your house plants show signs of mold? </li>

<li>Do you have air conditioners or humidifiers that have not been properly
cleaned? </li>

<li>Does your home have cockroaches or rodents? </li>
</ul>

<p><b>TOXIC REACTIONS</b> are the least studied and understood health problem
caused by some biological air pollutants in the home. Toxins can damage
a variety of organs and tissues in the body, including the liver, the central
nervous system, the digestive tract, and the immune system. </p>

<h3>Coping With the Problem</h3>

<p><b>Checking Your Home</b> </p>

<p>There is no simple and cheap way to sample the air in your home to determine
the level of all biological pollutants. Experts suggest that sampling for
biological pollutants is not a useful problem-solving tool. Even if you
had your home tested, it is almost impossible to know which biological
pollutant(s) cause various symptoms or health problems. The amount of most
biological substances required to cause disease is unknown and varies from
one person to the next. </p>

<p>Does this make the problem sound hopeless? On the contrary, you can
take several simple, practical actions to help remove sources of biological
pollutants, to help get rid of pollutants, and to prevent their return.
</p>

<p><b>Self-Inspection: A Walk Through Your Home</b> </p>

<p>Begin by touring your household. Follow your nose, and use your eyes.
Two major factors help create conditions for biological pollutants to grow:
nutrients and constant moisture with poor air circulation. </p>

<ul>
<li>Dust and construction materials, such as wood, wallboard, and insulation,
contain nutrients that allow biological pollutants to grow. Firewood also
is a source of moisture, fungi, and bugs. </li>

<li>Appliances such as humidifiers, kerosene and gas heaters, and gas stoves
add moisture to the air. </li>

<li>A musty odor, moisture on hard surfaces, or even water stains, may
be caused by: </li>

<ul>
<li>Air-conditioning units </li>

<li>Basements, attics, and crawlspaces </li>

<li>Bathrooms </li>

<li>Carpets </li>

<li>Heating and air-conditioning ducts </li>

<li>Humidifiers and dehumidifiers </li>

<li>Refrigerator drip pans </li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>What You Can Do About Biological Pollutants </b></p>

<p>Before you give away the family pet or move, there are less drastic
steps that can be taken to reduce potential problems. Properly cleaning
and maintaining your home can help reduce the problem and may avoid interrupting
your normal routine. People who have health problems such as asthma, or
are allergic, may need to do this and more. Discuss this with your doctor.
</p>

<p><b>Moisture Control</b> </p>

<p>Water in your home can come from many sources. Water can enter your
home by leaking or by seeping through basement floors. Showers or even
cooking can add moisture to the air in your home. The amount of moisture
that the air in your home can hold depends on the temperature of the air.
As the temperature goes down, the air is able to hold less moisture. This
is why, in cold weather, moisture condenses on cold surfaces (for example,
drops of water form on the inside of a window). This moisture can encourage
biological pollutants to grow. </p>

<p>There are many ways to control moisture in your home: </p>

<ul>
<li>Fix leaks and seepage. If water is entering the house from the outside,
your options range from simple landscaping to extensive excavation and
waterproofing. (The ground should slope away from the house.) Water in
the basement can result from the lack of gutters or a water flow toward
the house. Water leaks in pipes or around tubs and sinks can provide a
place for biological pollutants to grow. </li>

<li>Put a plastic cover over dirt in crawlspaces to prevent moisture from
coming in from the ground. Be sure crawlspaces are well-ventilated. </li>

<li>Use exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens to remove moisture to the
outside (not into the attic). Vent your clothes dryer to the outside. </li>

<li>Turn off certain appliances (such as humidifiers or kerosene heaters)
if you notice moisture on windows and other surfaces. </li>

<li>Use dehumidifiers and air conditioners, especially in hot, humid climates,
to reduce moisture in the air, but be sure that the appliances themselves
don't become sources of biological pollutants. </li>

<li>Raise the temperature of cold surfaces where moisture condenses. Use
insulation or storm windows. (A storm window installed on the inside works
better than one installed on the outside.) Open doors between rooms (especially
doors to closets which may be colder than the rooms) to increase circulation.
Circulation carries heat to the cold surfaces. Increase air circulation
by using fans and by moving furniture from wall corners to promote air
and heat circulation. Be sure that your house has a source of fresh air
and can expel excessive moisture from the home. </li>

<li>Pay special attention to carpet on concrete floors. Carpet can absorb
moisture and serve as a place for biological pollutants to grow. Use area
rugs which can be taken up and washed often. In certain climates, if carpet
is to be installed over a concrete floor, it may be necessary to use a
vapor barrier (plastic sheeting) over the concrete and cover that with
sub-flooring (insulation covered with plywood) to prevent a moisture problem.
</li>

<li>Moisture problems and their solutions differ from one climate to another.
The Northeast is cold and wet; the Southwest is hot and dry; the South
is hot and wet; and the Western Mountain states are cold and dry. All of
these regions can have moisture problems. For example, evaporative coolers
used in the Southwest can encourage the growth of biological pollutants.
In other hot regions, the use of air conditioners which cool the air too
quickly may prevent the air conditioners from running long enough to remove
excess moisture from the air. The types of construction and weatherization
for the different climates can lead to different problems and solutions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Maintain And Clean AU Appliances That Come In Contact With Water </p>

<ul>
<li>Have major appliances, such as furnaces, heat pumps and central air
conditioners, inspected and cleaned regularly by a professional, especially
before seasonal use. Change filters on heating and cooling systems according
to manufacturer's directions. (In general, change filters monthly during
use.) When first turning on the heating or air conditioning at the start
of the season, consider leaving your home until it airs out. </li>

<li>Have window or wall air-conditioning units cleaned and serviced regularly
by a professional, especially before the cooling season. Air conditioners
can help reduce the entry of allergy-causing pollen. But they may also
become a source of biological pollutants if not properly maintained. Clean
the coils and incline the drain pans according to manufacturer's instructions,
so water cannot collect in pools. </li>

<li>Have furnace-attached humidifiers cleaned and serviced regularly by
a professional, especially before the heating season. </li>

<li>Follow manufacturer's instructions when using any type of humidifier.
Experts differ on the benefits of using humidifiers. If you do use a portable
humidifier (approximately 1 to 2 gallon tanks), be sure to empty its tank
every day and refill with distilled or demineralized water, or even fresh
tap water if the other types of water are unavailable. For larger portable
humidifiers, change the water as recommended by the manufacturer. Unplug
the appliance before cleaning. Every third day, clean all surfaces coming
in contact with water with a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide, using a
brush to loosen deposits. Some manufacturers recommend using diluted household
bleach for cleaning and maintenance, generally in a solution of one-half
cup bleach to one gallon water. When using any household chemical, rinse
well to remove all traces of chemical before refilling humidifier. </li>

<li>Empty dehumidifiers daily and clean often. If possible, have the appliance
drip directly into a drain. Follow manufacturer's instructions for cleaning
and maintenance. Always disconnect the appliance before cleaning. </li>

<li>Clean refrigerator drip pans regularly according to manufacturer's
instructions. If refrigerator and freezer doors don't seal properly, moisture
may build up and mold can grow. Remove any mold on door gaskets and replace
faulty gaskets. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Clean Surfaces</b> </p>

<ul>
<li>Clean mold surfaces, such as showers and kitchen counters. </li>

<li>Remove meld from walls, ceilings, floors, and panelling. Do not simply
cover mold with paint, stain, varnish, or a moisture-proof sealer, as it
may resurface. </li>

<li>Replace moldy shower curtains, or remove them and scrub well with a
household cleaner and rinse before rehanging them. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Dust Control</b> </p>

<p>Controlling dust is very important for people who are allergic to animal
dander and mites. You cannot see mites, but you can either remove their
favorite breeding grounds or keep these areas dry and clean. Dust mites
can thrive in sofas, stuffed chairs, carpets, and bedding. Open shelves,
fabric wallpaper, knickknacks, and venetian blinds are also sources of
dust mites. Dust mites live deep in the carpet and are not removed by vacuuming.
Many doctors suggest that their mite-allergic patients use washable area
rugs rather than wall-to-wall carpet. </p>

<ul>
<li>Always wash bedding in hot water (at least 130ø F) to kill dust mites.
Cold water won't do the job. Launder bedding at least every 7 to 10 days.
</li>

<li>Use synthetic or foam rubber mattress pads and pillows, and plastic
mattress covers if you are allergic. Do not use fuzzy wool blankets, feather
or wool-stuffed comforters, and feather pillows. </li>

<li>Clean rooms and closets well; dust and vacuum often to remove surface
dust. Vacuuming and other cleaning may not remove all animal dander, dust
mite material, and other biological pollutants. Some particles are so small
they can pass through vacuum bags and remain in the air. If you are allergic
to dust, wear a mask when vacuuming or dusting. People who are highly allergy-prone
should not perform these tasks. They may even need to leave the house when
someone else is cleaning </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Before You Move</b> </p>

<p>Protect yourself by inspecting your potential new home. If you identify
problems, have the landlord or seller correct them before you move in,
or even consider moving elsewhere. </p>

<ul>
<li>Have professionals check the heating and cooling system, including
humidifiers and vents. Have duct lining and insulation checked for growth.
</li>

<li>Check for exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens. If there are no vents,
do the kitchen and bathrooms have at least one window apiece? Does the
cooktop have a hood vented outside? Does the clothes dryer vent outside?
Are all vents to the outside of the building, not into attics or crawlspaces?
</li>

<li>Look for obvious mold growth throughout the house, including attics,
basements, and crawlspaces, and around the foundation. See if there are
many plants close to the house, particularly if they are damp and rotting.
They are a potential source of biological pollutants. Downspouts from roof
gutters should route water away from the building. </li>

<li>Look for stains on the walls, floor or carpet (including any carpet
over concrete floors) as evidence of previous flooding or moisture problems.
Is there moisture on windows and surfaces? Are there signs of leaks or
seepage in the basement? </li>

<li>Look for rotted building materials which may suggest moisture or water
damage. </li>

<li>If you or anyone else in the family has a pet allergy, ask if any pets
have lived in the home. </li>

<li>Examine the design of the building. Remember that in cold climates,
overhanging areas, rooms over unheated garages, and closets on outside
walls may be prone to problems with biological pollutants. </li>

<li>Look for signs of cockroaches. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Where Biological Pollutants May Be Found In The Home</h3>

<ol>
<li>Dirty air conditioners </li>

<li>Dirty humidifiers and/or dehumidifiers </li>

<li>Bathroom without vents or windows </li>

<li>Kitchen without vents or windows </li>

<li>Dirty refrigerator drip pans </li>

<li>Laundry room with unvented dryer </li>

</ol>

<h3>Warning!</h3>

<p><b>Carefully read instructions for use and any cautionary labeling on
cleaning products before beginning cleaning procedures. </b></p>

<ul>
<li>Do not mix any chemical products. Especially, never mix cleaners containing
bleach with any product (such as ammonia) which does not have instructions
for such mixing. When chemicals are combined, a dangerous gas can sometimes
be formed. </li>

<li>Household chemicals may cause burning or irritation to skin and eyes.
</li>

<li>Household chemicals may be harmful if swallowed, or inhaled. </li>

<li>Avoid contact with skin, eyes, mucous membranes and clothing </li>

<li>Avoid breathing vapor. Open all windows and doors and use an exhaust
fan that sends the air outside. </li>

<li>Keep household chemicals out of reach of children. </li>

<li>Rinse treated surface areas well to remove all traces of chemicals.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Correcting Water Damage</h3>

<p>What if damage is already done? Follow these guidelines for correcting
water damage: </p>

<ul>
<li>Throw out mattresses, wicker furniture, straw baskets and the like
that have been water damaged or contain mold. These cannot be recovered.
</li>

<li>Discard any water-damaged furnishings such as carpets, drapes, stuffed
toys, upholstered furniture and ceiling tiles, unless they can be recovered
by steam cleaning or hot water washing and thorough drying. </li>

<li>Remove and replace wet insulation to prevent conditions where biological
pollutants can grow. </li>
</ul>
