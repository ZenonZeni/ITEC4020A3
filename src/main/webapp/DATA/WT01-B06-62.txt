What Are Your Sources of Retirement Income?  </H2></P>
<HR>
Almost all investors would agree that providing for a comfortable retirement is a paramount financial objective. To plan properly, you need to answer two questions:<P>

<UL>
<LI>How much will be needed for retirement?<P>


<LI>What will be the sources for meeting that need?<P>
</UL>

Estimating your retirement needs, of course, is not an easy task. But equally difficult is the other half of the equation--sorting out where your retirement dollars will originate. For most individuals, there are four basic retirement income sources: Social Security, employer-sponsored defined benefit plans, tax-deferred savings plans such as 401(k)s, and personal savings. How much you are likely to receive from each of these sources will vary greatly with personal circumstances, of course.<P>


What can you expect to receive from Social Security at retirement? Benefits come in the form of monthly payments, based on your final years' salary and number of working years. You can get an estimate of your earned Social Security benefits by sending in Form SSA-7004 "Request for Social Security Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement" to Social Security [call 800/772-1213 to request form]. The statement lists your earnings for each year and provides an estimate of benefits, based on when you plan to retire (you are asked your retirement date when you fill out the request form). To calculate the estimate, Social Security must make a number of assumptions concerning future earnings; thus, the closer you are to retirement, the more realistic the estimate.<P>


For those who have maximum taxable earnings, Social Security is designed to replace roughly 25% of the portion of pay subject to Social Security taxes; individuals who have earnings that are less than the maximum subject to Social Security taxes receive a somewhat higher percentage of their final pay in the form of benefits.<P>


Another potential retirement income source is employer-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans--commonly called "pension" plans.<P>


Benefits received under these plans are in the form of monthly payments, based on the employee's years of service and final years' salary. Monthly retirement benefits from defined benefit plans may be paid either directly by the company, or from annuities purchased by the company.<P>


Employees start accruing benefits (known as "vesting") after a certain number of years with a firm. Benefits under these plans are usually based on your years of service and either your average salary for the last five years or the last full year of employment; most plans then multiply the salary figure and the years of service by a percentage to calculate the actual amount at retirement. Pension plans are designed to replace only a portion of your salary upon retirement.<P>


If your company sponsors a defined benefit plan, you should check the rules regarding when you vest in the plan, the formula used to determine your monthly benefit (especially important for those who expect to retire soon), whether the plan has a cost-of-living adjustment for retirees (a few do), and the portability of your benefits. The latter offers employees considerable flexibility: Some defined benefit plans have been modified recently to allow you to take the present value of some of your accrued benefits with you when you leave the company (a so-called "cash balance" plan). You then have the option of rolling this over into an IRA; if you have enough investment acumen, you may be able to grow these dollars to a higher level than would have accrued under the plan. Make sure you understand the tax rules regarding distributions and rollovers, however.<P>


Some employers will give current employees an annual estimate of what they can expect to receive at retirement. The caveat is that the estimate makes certain assumptions: you will work at the same company until retirement and your salary increases by a certain fixed percentage (often only 3% or 4%).<P>


If you leave a company before retirement and are vested in the firm's defined benefit plan, you should request a calculation of the monthly benefits that could be expected at the normal retirement age.<P>


Many companies are phasing out pension plans in favor of contributory plans, such as 401(k) plans. For that reason, pension plans are likely to be a larger source of retirement income to today's older workers, while contributory plans are most likely to play a large role in younger workers' retirement plans.<P>


Contributory plans allow employees to invest pretax money (up to set limits) in various investment alternatives chosen by the employer. Employers do not have to match an employee's contribution, although many do match part or all of what an employee puts into the plan.<P>


Retirement benefits from a contributory plan come in the form of a lump-sum dollar amount upon retirement. The size of this amount will depend on the investment choices you make over the years, the amount contributed each year, and the number of years you participate. You can make a very rough calculation of your final amount by making an estimate of your annual contributions, the number of years to retirement and the approximate return you expect on your investments (based on your investment mix), and using an annuity table (the future value of a periodic investment).<P>


Clearly, the size of your benefits depends on decisions you make within the limits of the choices offered. If you are a participant in a 401(k)-type plan, you should make sure you understand the investment choices available, and you should carefully plan an investment strategy making best use of the options.<P>


You should also become familiar with the administrative rules governing the plan. While an employee has a vested right to the current value of the money he contributed, he may not have an immediate right to any contribution made by the employer. Often a plan states that the employer's contribution vests to the employee after a period of time --say, one year. Employees leaving one company for another should know exactly what they are entitled to from their former plan. In addition, they should be aware of the tax rules regarding distributions and rollovers.<P>


The last source for potential retirement income is personal savings. For the most part, your personal savings will consist of a lump-sum amount that you will have saved by retirement, based on how much you have saved and where you have invested it. If you have purchased annuities, however, you will receive a monthly fixed payment.<P>


One way of analyzing your retirement sources is by dividing them into sources of periodic income and sources of lump-sum assets upon retirement. The latter would supplement the former to the extent that further retirement income is needed. Table 1 lists possible sources of periodic income and sources of lump-sum assets at retirement, as well as their tax characteristics at retirement.<P>


What steps should you take to beef up your sources?<P>


For older workers (for instance, those in the 55 to 60 age group):<P>

<UL>
<LI>You cannot do very much about your Social Security or defined benefit sources.<P>


<LI>If you expect to work for several more years, maximize your use of a 401(k) and choose investment options that offer some growth of capital with moderate risk. The current level of interest rates means that GICs might provide a return around 6.0%; a balanced fund option might give you higher returns with more risk. An aggressive stock fund should be avoided because of the high volatility associated with that investment and the limited time available to recover from a market decline.<P>


<LI>Personal savings should be maximized, but a caveat is required regarding tax-free securities: If you plan to hold them while you are collecting Social Security, you must include all of your tax-free income when calculating the possible tax on Social Security benefits.<P>
</UL>

For younger workers: <P>

<UL>
<LI>Realize that you must place a far lower reliance on defined benefit dollars for retirement, and possibly even Social Security.<P>


<LI>The significance of 401(k) plans means that you must make the most of these plans, contributing the maximum amount that you can and investing for the long term. This means equity investment, especially growth stock vehicles if they are available.<P>


<LI>Personal savings must be maximized to make up for the diminished dollars from Social Security.<P>
