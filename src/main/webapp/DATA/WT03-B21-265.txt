     CIESIN is the World Data Center-A for Human Interactions in the Environment. CIESIN provides on-line access
     to data, information, and applications that are used by researchers, decision makers and the general public to
     reach a better understanding of how human activity is driving global environmental change. CIESIN also
     operates the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) for NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS)
     Data and Information System.

 What is CIESIN's Information Cooperative, and how can I gain access to its holdings?
<DD>     The Information Cooperative is a distributed, electronic data and information system created to address the
     information needs of users concerned with understanding global environmental change and sustainable
     development issues. The Information Cooperative provides easy access to major data archives and resource
     centers that electronically share their catalog information (metadata) and actual data. It links well-established
     information centers and agencies from around the world, including the United Nations and many
     non-governmental organizations. The CIESIN Gateway makes it possible to search for and retrieve data and
     metadata (data about data) from CIESIN's "virtual archive" of distributed resources. There is an easy to use
     character based interface to the Gateway, and graphical user interface clients are available for MS Windows and
     X-Windows from the Gateway home page . A www interface is in development, and will be released in earl y
     1996.

 What are some of the key issues of human interactions in the environment, and how can I become
acquainted with these issues?
<DD>     The CIESIN Thematic Guides offer on-line access to the full texts of hundreds of journal articles, book sections
     and chapters, papers from proceedings, government reports, maps and images, and other relevant materials on
     important topics in the area of human interactions in the environment. Thematic Guides are currently available
     for the following topics: 
     <DD><LI>     Agriculture 
        <DD><LI>    Human Dimensions Research Programs 
 <DD><LI>           Human Health

 What global population data resources are available through CIESIN?
<DD>     CIESIN disseminates the Gridded Population of the World dataset, a five minute grid of world population
     counts and densities. CIESIN also provides access to the World Bank Social Indicators of Development, a
     searchable relational database containing as many as 94 indicators from 170 countries for the years 1965-1992.
     In addition, CIESIN has georeferenced Mexico population data, and extensive holdings of United States
     population data.

 What are CIESIN's U.S. population data resources?
<DD>     CIESIN has a range of U.S. Population data resources. CIESIN maintains an anonymous FTP archive of census
     related products that includes enhanced county to county migration files; standard extracts of 225 variables from
     the '90 Summary Tape File (STF) 3A for the various census geographies from blockgroup and up; and '92 digital
     TIGER boundary files for the various census geographies from block and up. Links to the STF extracts and
     TIGER files can be found on the U.S. Demography home page .

<DD>     CIESIN also has a cross-tabulation engine, Ulysses, that provides interactive access to the '70, '80 and '90
     decennial census Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). The engine uses a simple menuing query building
     system, and the data dictionary is on-line. Access to Ulysses is by public login: telnet infoserver.ciesin.org, login:
     ulysses.

<DD>     CIESIN can also provide custom rectangularized extracts from the 1% and 5% '80 and '90 PUMS, and the
     '68-'92 March Current Population Surveys (CPS). Submit your request to CIESIN User Services.

<DD>     In addition, CIESIN has processed U.S. population and housing densities onto a one kilometer grid using a
     proportional allocation algorithm to facilitate the integration of these data with remotely sensed data. See the
     Population, Land Use and Emissions Project home page.

 What is CIESIN doing in the area of data visualization? 
<DD>     CIESIN has developed two spatial data viewers . The Great Lakes Map Server allows you to define the
     boundaries of a polygon in the Great Lakes Basin, and map political and hydrologic boundaries, along with sites
     that are monitored by the EPA.

<DD>     The Demographic Data Viewer allows you to select a variable from the STF3A file, and map it for a state or the
     whole U.S. at a range of census geographic resolutions. The data beneath the Demographic Data Viewer are
     available for FTP through the archive of census related products .

<DD>     You can also visualize outputs from selected integrated assessment models (IAMs) of climate change .

 What are integrated assessment models of climate change, and how can I learn more about integrated
assessment modeling?
   <DD>  Integrated assessment models are tools for the joint assessment of:
<DD><LI>the social and economic factors that drive
     greenhouse gas emissions; 
<DD><LI>the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the global biosphere and climate; and
<DD><LI>in turn, the effects of changes in the biosphere and climate on economies and societies. You can explore a
     detailed description of integrated assessment modeling; a detailed description of selected integrated assessment
     models (IAMS)
<DD><LI> interactively browse precomputed outputs from selected IAMS through the SEDAC Model
     Visualization and Analysis Service.

 I need to know which countries are party to a number of international environmental agreements. How can
I find out which countries are party to which agreements? 
<DD>     The Environmental Treaties and Resource Indicators project allows you to search a relational database of
     environmental treaties, agreements and conventions, and find out which countries are party to which agreements,
     and when they became party to the agreements. There are treaty summaries, full text of treaties, and treaty status
     files for more than 120 international environmental agreements in the areas of global climate change,
     stratospheric ozone depletion, transboundary air pollution, land use/land cover change and desertification,
     conservation of biological diversity, deforestation, oceans and their living resources, trade and the environment,
     and population. By mid 1996, you will be able to relate a country's treaty status to any of a number of economic
     and natural resource indicators.
