<H2><CENTER>EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION</H2></CENTER><P><HR>

Creative approaches to inclusive schooling are being discovered throughout the United States every day as parents and educators work together to meet the unique needs of their students. Today it is common to see youngsters with Down syndrome, in  every part of the country, included in their neighborhood schools. Boys and girls, in rural, urban, and suburban locations, at the preschool, elementary, and secondary level are able to enjoy the company of their peers and the activities of the regular school setting.<P>

Inclusion in the regular classroom is only one of the many options available to children with Down syndrome. It is, however, an important one. This brochure is designed to familiarize you with the philosophy and practice of inclusion and in doing so, help you make the most informed decision about your child's education. <P>

<B><CENTER>INCLUSION IS...</B></CENTER><P>

<B>A PHILOSOPHY.</B> It is a belief in every person's inherent right to participate fully in society. Inclusion implies acceptance of differences. It means making room for a person who would otherwise be excluded. Translating this philosophy into reality is a process that requires collaboration, teamwork, flexibility, a willingness to take risks, and support from a whole array of individuals, services, and institutions. <P>

<B>A PRACTICE.</B> It is the educational process by which all students, even those with disabilities, are educated together, with sufficient support, in age-appropriate, regular education programs in their neighborhood schools. The goal of inclusive education is to prepare all students for productive lives as full, participating members of their communities.<P>

<B>EVOLVING.</B> As people learn more about inclusion, they understand that "full inclusion" means that students with Down syndrome are part of the regular education system--even if their curricular goals and needs differ from those of their classmates.<P>

<B>REWARDING FOR ALL PEOPLE INVOLVED.</B> When inclusion is carried out appropriately, research has demonstrated benefits to students with Down syndrome as well as to their peers. Friendships develop, students without disabilities learn to appreciate differences, and students with disabilities are more motivated. All of this is carried home and into the community.<P>

<B><CENTER>INCLUSION IS NOT....</B></CENTER>

<B>A PASSING FAD.</B> Numerous federal district court decisions have affirmed the right of students with Down syndrome to attend regular classes full time when the educational benefits for the student warrant such a placement. Inclusion, with its focus on outcomes, is the spirit of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the trend for the future.  <P>

<B>DUMPING.</B> It does not mean that a child with special needs is placed in a classroom without adequate support and appropriate services. It does not mean that undue burdens are placed on teachers and peers. Thoughtful planning, continual monitoring, and sufficient support are all part of successful inclusion programs.<P>
 
<B>EASY.</B> Parents, educators, peers, and administrators are all partners in the inclusion process and must work together to make it successful. On-going problem solving is involved.<P>

<B>MAINSTREAMING.</B> Inclusion is more than mainstreaming. Mainstreaming implies that a child from a special education class visits the regular class for specific, usually non-academic, subjects. Inclusion means that a student with special needs is part of the regular class, even if he or she receives occasional services in another setting.<P>

<B><CENTER>WHAT MAKES INCLUSION SUCCESSFUL?</B></CENTER>

<B>*A Commitment to the philosophy of inclusion</B> and a belief in the equal value of all students must be shared by everyone. Many school districts make explicit mention in their mission statements that the educational goals of students with disabilities are of equal value to those of other students. <P>

<B>*Accountability</B> assures that all individuals, at the district, building, and classroom level delegate tasks appropriately and fulfill their responsibilities. The department of special education should have clearly defined policies for program implementation.<P>

<B>*Careful assessment and planning</B> guarantees that the student's curriculum is appropriate; adequate support is provided; and long and short-term goals are met. Assessment should focus on the child's strengths, and parents should actively participate in the design of the Individualized Education Program (IEP).<P>

<B>*Collaboration</B> requires that all participants be equal partners. Teachers will be working together in and out of the classroom; peers will become allies and friends; and parents will continually be interacting with the school system. The need for teamwork is constant and only through cooperative effort does inclusion work.<P>

<B>*Flexibility</B> must be present at every stage of the inclusion process. Because teaching models are often altered, curriculum adaptations made, and unique needs addressed, all participants must be willing to accept compromise and try new situations.<P>

<B>*Funding</B> must be available for the necessary support services. Some research has shown that districts which are implementing inclusion are not spending more than their segregated counterparts; rather, they are shifting costs.<P>

<B>*Good Leadership</B> sets the tone for the entire process. Principals and superintendents must convey a positive attitude towards inclusion and foster a supportive environment in which new and challenging situations are dealt with in a flexible manner. Teachers who have the encouragement and backing of their supervisors are often the most successful initiators of change. <P>

<B>*Social skills and peer relationships</B> are two of the most important foundations for, and by-products of, inclusion. Peers are positive role models for speech and appropriate behavior. As allies and friends, peers offer support in and out of the classroom: in cooperative learning situations; in peer support groups; and in after school activities. Friendships develop which extend beyond the classroom. <P>

<B>*Support</B> includes everything necessary to meet the goals established in the IEP. Additional personnel may be present in the classroom; peers may form a support network; curricula may be adapted; teaching methods may change; physical accommodations may be made; and therapies may be given. Support can be extensive or minimal, depending on the needs of the particular student. For teachers, support may mean encouragement from supervisors; collaboration with peers; team teaching; feedback from parents; or access to the many resources available on inclusion.<P>

<B>*Transition planning</B> alleviates potential problems. Before the school year begins, teachers and staff should have appropriate training; the student with Down syndrome should be familiar with his or her surroundings; and peers should receive orientation.  Knowledge about Down syndrome, and the abilities of people with Down syndrome, will lessen the apprehension of teachers and classmates.<P>

<B><CENTER>WHAT CAN YOU DO TO FOSTER YOUR CHILD'S INCLUSION?</B></CENTER><P>

<B>*Become aware of your rights under federal and state laws.</B> Learn about IDEA and what it means for your child. If you request an appropriate inclusion program, your school system is required to provide it. A child cannot be placed in a more restrictive environment unless the school system has shown that inclusion was unsuccessful despite the provision of appropriate support and services. <P>

<B>*Communicate with the school system.</B> Help administrators and teachers develop methods that will work well. Provide insight and awareness regarding the needs and goals of your child. <P>

<B>*Learn about successful inclusion practices.</B> Contact parents, organizations, and schools that have made inclusion work. Write for information from the growing number of national organizations that have a proven commitment to inclusion. Form support networks. Avail yourself of the numerous publications and videos available. <P>

<B>*Participate in the design of your child's IEP.</B> The goals and objectives listed in the IEP will determine not only what your child is taught, but how and where that teaching will take place.<P>

Since the passage of Public Law 94-142 in 1975, educational options for children with Down syndrome have expanded greatly. IEPs are now provided for all children with special needs; parent involvement in the planning process is sought; and advocacy and support is widely available. Inclusion represents the latest effort to provide all children with the best education possible in the diversity of their neighborhood school.<P>

<B><CENTER>TERMINOLOGY</B></CENTER><P>

<B>Cooperative Learning</B>--A group of students with diverse skills and traits working together. This promotes collaboration, teamwork, and an appreciation of differences while fostering long-term relationships.<P>

<B>IDEA</B>--The federal law supporting special education and related service programming for children and youth with disabilities.  Also referred to as Public Law 101-476, IDEA reauthorized and expanded the provisions guaranteed under Public Law 94-142 in 1990. <P>

<B>Public Law 94-142</B>--The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975. This law mandates a free appropriate public education (FAPE) for all children with disabilities; education in the least restrictive environment (LRE); and individualized education programs. It ensures due process rights and is the core of federal funding for special education. It was renamed and amended in 1990 and is now known as IDEA.<P>

<B>FAPE</B>--A free appropriate public education refers to special education and related services which are provided at public expense to meet the educational goals defined in the child's IEP.<P>

<B>IEP</B>--The individualized education program is the written plan for each school year which delineates the goals and special services necessary to meet the child's needs. Parents, teachers, and administrators take part in the preparation of the child's IEP for the academic year.<P>

<B>LRE</B>--The least restrictive environment provision of the IDEA states that to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities are educated with children who do not have disabilities "and that special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of .... children from the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the handicap is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily."<P>

<B>Teaching</B>--A broad term referring to different groupings of teachers. One common method is to have a regular education teacher team up with a general education teacher and together be responsible for all the children of the class. All team teaching is based on shared responsibility and collaboration.<P>

<h3>Nationwide Study Finds Inclusive Education Rewarding for All Involved</h3><br>

The inclusion of students with Down syndrome in typical classrooms is a more rewarding experience than expected for both students and classmates, according to a recently released national study.
<p>
Inclusion is the educational process by which all students, with or without disabilities, are educated together, with sufficient support, in age-appropriate, regular education programs in their neighborhood schools. Support is often provided in a "push-in" (in-class aid), or "pull-out" (visits to a resource room) basis.
<p> 
The majority of teachers who participated in the nationwide study, commissioned by the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) and conducted by Gloria Wolpert, Ed.D., reported that entire classes benefit from working with a student with Down syndrome. Almost all teachers who responded found inclusion enjoyable, with some calling it the single most interesting and rewarding experience of their careers.
The NDSS study was conducted to determine the success, or lack of success, of inclusive practices, and to identify the common characteristics of the most successful programs. The study included a nationwide survey of parents and teachers. .
Overall, both parents and teachers find current inclusive practices successful, but there is room for improvement. The study found that more appropriate teacher preparation and more time for conferences between teachers, therapists, parents and support personnel would be beneficial to all involved. 
<p>
Factors which directly affect the success of an inclusive experience, as measured by both parents and teachers, include a match of teacher personality and style to the skills of a student. Teachers who are flexible, willing to modify classroom materials, and who utilize hands-on learning tools, are the bests catalysts for achievement.
<p>
Those parents whose children with Down syndrome had friends in class rated the inclusion experience the most successful, and reported great benefits in the areas of communication, self esteem and independence. Teacher preparation is important for success, but surprisingly, formal training from the school district does not appear to be relevant.
<p>
A copy of the Educational Challenges Inclusion Study, which includes suggestions for classroom practice, can be obtained after October 1, by sending a check or money order for $10 to cover printing and postage, to the NDSS Educational Challenges Program, 666 Broadway, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2317.

<h3>New 1996 Teaching Partnership Poster Brings Inclusion Message<br>
To Grades 4, 5 and 6</h3><br>
<p>
The National Down Syndrome Society is proud to launch the second phase of its Teaching Partnership program, which brings our message of inclusion, understanding and friendship to grades 4, 5 and 6. The second phase was developed in response to the overwhelmingly positive feedback received from our first phase, which targeted grades 1,2 and 3. In this phase, a combination poster/lesson plan was distributed to 43,000 elementary schools, prompting hundreds of children to write essays about their new understanding of their classmates with Down syndrome. All this would not have been possible without the generous support of many of people, like you, who have an interest in inclusive education.
<p>
The second phase of the Teaching Partnership program targets slightly older students, in grades 4,5 and 6. Both the poster and accompanying lesson plan center on the theme, <i>"Friendship Knows No Boundaries."</i> It offers in-class exercises to help students understand what it’s like to have a developmental disability, and fosters friendships among all students. 
<p>
This practical, educational tool enables teachers to explore these issues, and create a more inclusive classroom in which all our children may thrive. The National Down Syndrome Society needs your help in bringing this innovative teaching tool to our nation’s schools. Production and postage expenses to reach every school with a 4th, 5th or 6th grade class would total about $100,000.
<p> 
This cost would be prohibitive without special assistance from our supporters. But, if every person who receives this newsletter offers even a small contribution, we will be well on our way to bringing our message of inclusion to every school in the country.
Your donation to the Teaching Partnership program is a contribution to a more accepting, inclusive society that will benefit all of us. Please help us teach all our children to be understanding and accepting of one another’s differences, by sending your tax-deductible contribution in the enclosed envelope. To obtain a copy of the new Teaching Partnership poster, please include the form below with your donation for $10 or more, to help cover costs.

<h3>1995 Down Syndrome Teaching Poster Contains Lessons for All Students</h3><BR>
	An educational poster, complete with lessons for students through  grade 3, can help teachers demonstrate to children that their peers with Down syndrome and other developmental disabilities are more alike them than different.<BR>
	The poster, available through the National Down Syndrome Society to mark <B>October</B> as <B>National Down Syndrome Awareness Month,</B> will be sent free of charge to all educators and parents who request them. A small fee is charged for multiple copies.<BR>
	The front of the poster portrays two sisters, one with Down syndrome, embracing each other, and the theme, <B>"None of us are the same on the outside. All of us are the same on the inside."</B><BR>
	The reverse side contains tools for teachers to discuss Down syndrome with their students, and encourage children to accept those who are different.<BR>
	"Recognizing that many children are first exposed to people with Down syndrome and other developmental disabilities in the classroom, we feel that it is important for elementary school  teachers to address the issues of awareness and acceptance," explained Myra E. Madnick, executive director of the National Down Syndrome Society. "We developed this poster to help teachers introduce the subject and encourage positive relationships among all children."<BR>
	The National Down Syndrome Society works to promote a better understanding of Down syndrome and the potential of people with Down syndrome; to support research about this genetic condition; and to provide services for families and individuals involved with Down syndrome. NDSS disseminates information about the inclusion of children with Down syndrome in the regular classroom.<BR>
	For more information about Down syndrome, inclusive education, or to request a poster, call the National Down Syndrome Society at 1-800-221-4602.<P>

<B>The Educational Challenges Program</B><BR>
           This two-year study of inclusive education examines the nature of the public school experience for children with Down syndrome. Directed by Gloria Wolpert, Ed.D., this study is the first national survey of inclusion for children with Down syndrome and explores the full spectrum of options that are, or should be, available to all children with Down syndrome. As part of the Educational Challenges Program, NDSS has developed a pamphlet on inclusion and an annotated resource list of organizations and materials available to help parents and professionals.<P>
