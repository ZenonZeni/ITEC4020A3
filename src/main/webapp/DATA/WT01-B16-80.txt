<H3>Exploring the Future of In Situ Leach Uranium Mining. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/akinbio.html">Hikmet Akin</A>.</H3>
<P>

In present day market conditions, US mining companies take uranium from only the lowest cost
deposits, and most US uranium production presently comes from ISL operations. In a graph of
mine productivity which shows number of pounds U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB></SMALL>O<SMALL>
<SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> produced per employee per year, apart
from projects with high grade reserves such as Key Lake and Rabbit Lake, many of the most
productive units are US ISL operations.<P>

ISL operations in the US are reviewed as they provide the best example of the evolution of ISL
mining. Beginning in 1974, the method was at first restricted to sites too problematic for
conventional mining. Costs were at first high, (US$15-40 pound) but are now comparable to
conventional methods. Crow Butte mine is used to illustrate requirements for and developments
in ISL: situated in Nebraska, the project is owned by Uranerz, Geomex and KEPRA. Uranium-
bearing permeable Oligocene sandstones at depth 150-200 metres are overlain and capped by
impermeable clay and siltstone layers. The ore, grade 0.25% U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB>
</SMALL>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB>, occurs in horizons 1.5-4.5 m
thick, and reserves are estimated at 30 million pounds (11 500 tU). Extraction comprises firstly
oxidation: formational waters are fortified with soda ash and carbon dioxide to form a sodium
bicarbonate alkaline leach chemistry, then gaseous oxygen is added to the solution and it is
pumped into a series of injection wells; and secondly dissolution: the oxygen oxidises the uranium
causing it to dissolve and complex with the bicarbonate, the solution is pumped up the recovery
well and an ion exchanger removes the uranium from the water, giving saleable yellowcake. Water
from the processing plant is recycled back to the wellfields, and groundwater from the wellfields
is, by law, returned to its natural condition. In 1994, the US's four remaining ISL operations
produced around 2.5 million pounds U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB></SMALL>O<SMALL>
<SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> (960 tU).<P>

Globally about 15% of world uranium originates from ISL mining. Countries with suitable
deposits include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, possibly Mongolia and China, parts of eastern Europe,
and Australia. CIS operators use an acid rather than an alkaline leach process, and less aquifer
restoration measures are taken. Uzbekistan, which has significant uranium reserves in the
Kyzylkum Desert sandstone basins, expects to produce more if not all of its uranium through ISL
in future, as does Kazakhstan. These countries each produce annually about 7 to 8 million pounds
U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB></SMALL>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB> (2700 -3000 tU).<P>

Cooperation between Western and Central Asian producers, such as the envisaged Inkai
Production Joint Venture between KATEP of Kazakhstan and Uranerz and Cameco, will enhance
Central Asia's economic potential. ISL cannot compete economically with high grade production
projects, but for low grade resources, if certain conditions are met, ISL offers a chance of survival
in a difficult economic climate.<P>
