Money: Back to the Future?<br>
<p>
By Walter Wriston (Former chairman of Citicorp)<br>
<p>
Americans are about to begin using a new kind of money<br>
that may have consequences for the Federal Reserve's<br>
control of the money supply and almost certainly for the<br>
velocity of money.<br>
<p>
Over the years, people have used all kinds of things for<br>
money, from the huge immovable stones in the front yards<br>
of the residents of Yap Island to the more familiar<br>
silver and gold. All these various mediums of exchange<br>
will now be joined in our country by the "smart" card --<br>
a piece of plastic embedded with a microchip.<br>
<p>
Smart cards combine features of the following: automatic<br>
teller machine cards that let you access your bank<br>
account and draw cash; MasterCard or Visa cards that<br>
permit you to buy now and pay later; and debit cards that<br>
charge an account at the time of purchase. Not only can<br>
smart cards do all of the above but they can also serve<br>
as an "electronic purse" independent of your bank<br>
account. These cards contain real money that can be spent<br>
at stores and restaurants. In effect, the card is an<br>
electronic traveler's check, but one that makes exact<br>
change. In addition, the integrated circuit chip allows<br>
a higher degree of security for the information stored<br>
than do the current magnetic strip cards.<br>
<p>
Smart cards are common in Europe and Asia, where some 400<br>
million were shipped last year. The first large-scale use<br>
of smart cards in this country will occur next year at<br>
the Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Plans call for 300,000<br>
rechargeable cards, and 700,000 disposable cards in<br>
denominations of $25, $50 and $100. These cards would fit<br>
nicely into the payment habits of Americans, since in the<br>
U.S. it is estimated that 88% of transactions are done by<br>
cash or check, and of these 83% are for less than $10. In<br>
Atlanta, electronic "purse cards," which contain stored<br>
value, could be spent at pay phones or vending machines.<br>
When their stored value is exhausted, they are thrown<br>
away. The smart cards, by contrast, can be taken back to<br>
the issuer and recharged.<br>
<p>
Their broad issuance and use could return America to<br>
something very close to the free banking of the last<br>
century, when every commercial bank issued dollar bills,<br>
backed sometimes by the skill of the management,<br>
sometimes by doubtful state bonds and sometimes by gold<br>
or silver.<br>
<p>
We have grown so accustomed to the familiar Federal<br>
Reserve note that many forget that Americans had no<br>
central bank for about 75 years -- from 1836, when<br>
President Jackson vetoed the bill to renew the charter of<br>
the Second Bank of the United States, to the start of<br>
World War I, when the Federal Reserve Act was passed.<br>
After the passage by New York state of the Free Banking<br>
Act in 1838, the idea of state-chartered banks spread<br>
across the country, and each commercial bank issued its<br>
own dollar bills of various shapes and sizes.<br>
<p>
This does not mean that the 19th century witnessed<br>
complete currency chaos. In 1863, the National Bank Act<br>
was passed to create a market in the government bonds<br>
needed to finance the Civil War and to bring some order<br>
to the private issuance of currency. The act required<br>
that bank notes issued by commercial banks be uniform in<br>
appearance and that they be backed by collateral<br>
consisting of U.S. Treasury securities. As the old Civil<br>
War bonds were paid off, the currency base of the country<br>
declined some 60% from 1881 to 1890. This inflexible<br>
system led to panics and instability.<br>
<p>
To a certain extent, the Treasury Department during this<br>
time assumed some of the functions of a central bank. All<br>
during this period a debate raged, not about whether<br>
America needed a central bank but about "free silver" and<br>
the price at which the Treasury would buy gold and<br>
silver. It was not until the eve of World War I that<br>
passage of the Federal Reserve Act finally gave the U.S.<br>
government a monopoly on the creation of money.<br>
<p>
Now we may be going back to the future. The advent of<br>
smart cards means that the Fed will lose its monopoly on<br>
issuing currency, except that this time the new money<br>
will be issued not only by banks but by all kinds of<br>
companies, from convenience stores to telephone<br>
companies. Nor is this the only trend threatening the<br>
Fed's monopoly: Information technology is about to permit<br>
the creation of both electronic token money and cash<br>
money in cyberspace. Already we have Digi Cash in<br>
Amsterdam reviving in modern guise something very close<br>
to the old American free-banking system -- issuing<br>
electronic money (backed by some depository bank holding<br>
collateral in the form of Treasury securities) and<br>
performing the clearing function.<br>
<p>
None of this is necessarily a cause for panic. There is<br>
very little, if any, evidence that government has managed<br>
our currency values any better than the commercial banks<br>
did in pre-Fed days. Indeed, the Nobel laureate economist<br>
F.A. Hayek put it more strongly: "The history of<br>
government management of money has, except for a few<br>
short happy periods, been one of incessant fraud and<br>
deception."<br>
<p>
Still these new trends do present worries for central<br>
bankers. If more and more firms issue cards for cash or<br>
credit, what will be the effect on the velocity of money?<br>
How will central banks form policies on the control of<br>
the money supply if any company can issue electronic<br>
purse cards on credit, with or without collateral? What<br>
will happen if the issuer of the card goes broke?<br>
<p>
As smart cards become more visible in America, regulators<br>
and governments will begin to wonder about control of<br>
money and credit. The Eulopean system of central banks<br>
has produced an advisory report outlining a possible<br>
regulatory response, and in this countly some Fed<br>
officials are starting to wonder if their regulations<br>
will be applicable. If one definition of money is an<br>
object that has no use except to be given to someone else<br>
in exchange for goods or services, smart cards are money<br>
-- and they are coming to your neighborhood soon.<br>
