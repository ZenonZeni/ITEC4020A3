<H2>The Scientific Case for Parity</H2>
<H4>by Laura Lee Hall, Ph.D., NAMI Deputy Director of Policy and Research</H4>
</font>
<hr>

	Who would have believed ten years ago, ten months ago, even 
ten weeks ago that the U.S. Congress would pass a law signaling an 
initial step toward ending insurance discrimination against people 
with brain disorders/mental illness?  Yet here we are, several 
weeks after the Rose Garden signing of the Domenici-Wellstone 
amendment into law, the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996.  
<P>
	It is proper that we pause and examine the case for parity,  
not only because this modest little policy step is historic, but 
because we run the risk of a pyrrhic victory ignored, defied, and 
overturned.
<P>
	Science helped us get here today and will help us fight the 
good fights of the future.  There is no question that improved 
diagnoses and treatments for brain disorders are a fundamental 
building block in the argument for parity.  There is no question 
that improved understanding of the biological underpinnings of some 
severe mental illnesses shatters the conceptual barrier between 
physical and mental illnesses.  There is no question that the 
economic analyses of parity's impact helped in the passage of this 
law and will be necessary for its future implementation and 
expansion.  Indeed, all of these data are the currency by which we 
will convince the idea-shapers and business leaders of the 
importance and practicality of parity.
<P>
	So, yes, science is important.  But in fact, this victory 
represents the strength of a multi-textured fabric, interwoven 
threads of science, political heroism, and advocacy by consumers 
and families.  
<P>
	We would not sit here today, still in the fresh-blush victory, 
if it weren't for the courageous and steadfast leadership of 
champions in the Congress, especially Senator Pete Domenici.  It 
was Senator Domenici who, all alone, offered several years ago his 
first parity bill in the Congress.  And it was Senator Pete 
Domenici who, at the midnight hour, refused to capitulate.  His 
standing, fortified by his dedication, made him a hero who couldn't 
be faced down.
<P>
	What accounts for the dedication of Senator Domenici, Senator 
Wellstone, and others?  As NAMI members, you know what creates this 
undying dedication and advocacy.  People with serious brain 
disorders and their families will never give up, be they U.S. 
Senators or ordinary citizens.
<P>
	You know the scenario too many families have faced.  A middle 
class family.  Parents both work.  They have private health 
insurance.  An adolescent son or daughter begins his or her descent 
into severe mental illness; symptoms of psychosis emerge, perhaps, 
and grow worse.  Intensive medical intervention, indeed 
hospitalization, is required.  That's when the parents learn that 
their insurance has a devastating gap.  They exceed their lifetime 
limit on coverage--$50,000, $20,000, even $6,000--far less than the 
$1 million cap typical for other serious illnesses.  In short, 
their insurance runs out long before their illness does.  Homes are 
remortgaged.  Savings accounts are wiped out.  Family vacations and 
the college education of children are jeopardized.  A lifetime of 
public welfare programs become the rosiest future.  The alternative 
is homelessness, jailing, suicide.  
<P>
	All because of a brain illness--and discrimination.  All in a 
country with a proud tradition of insuring, in the private sector, 
against the financial disaster that catastrophic illness can pose.
<P>
	This is--or has been--the fate of families facing serious 
brain disorders.  This fate has continued, even with treatment 
advances, new and more effective medications, and an incredible 
sense of hope among patients and their families for a better and 
productive life, recovery.
<P>
	Despite public ignorance.  Despite stigma.  Despite pervasive 
discrimination.  American families who live the reality of serious 
brain illness will get up every morning and fight.  We will be the 
little engine that could, and could, and could.  Because this is 
America, where ultimately there is no room for injustice.  Science 
provides proof of the discrimination.  People provide the passion.
<P>
	Many of us worry that this new law is a step so modest, so 
tentative, so insecure, that its only effect will be the 
mobilization of our opponents.  Many still harbor false images of 
mental illness and its treatment.  Many, in the business community, 
harbor concerns about the costs.  Many also bristle at the first 
signs of erosion in the protection against federal regulation that 
self-insured employers cherish.  
<P>
	But even as Rosa Parks in quiet dignity said "NO" to 
discrimination--and in all likelihood was surprised that her brave, 
simple act became a pivotal point in history--this small victory 
against discrimination can be a turning point as well.  But we must 
be smart and dedicated to continued progress, as the civil rights 
leaders in America were.
<P>
	We must make sure that:
<ol>
	<li> this small step is not repealed.

	<li> this law is implemented and enforced in a way that 
is real and not simply a shifting of discriminatory 
barriers to treatment with prohibitive increases in co-
pays and limits in doctors' visits and hospital stays.

	<li> that this step is expanded upon by expanding the 
federal parity provision to be real parity for people 
with serious brain disorders; by working stridently for 
state parity laws (after all, the Domenici-Wellstone 
amendment does not mandate mental health coverage; it 
excludes employers with fewer than 50 employees; and it 
only covers annual and lifetime limits); and by working 
to end discrimination against people with brain 
disorders in all areas of public life--private 
insurance, public-sector programs, managed care 
organizations and HMOs, housing, and employment.  
</ol>
<P>
	We have won the first struggle in a titanic battle between two 
strongly held ideas:  freedom from government mandates versus an 
end to discrimination.  We must bring to victory the cause of 
justice and anti-discrimination.
<P>
	Our science will be necessary to support this historic battle. 
 We need continued research and dissemination of this research to 
the public so that we better understand the underpinnings of 
serious brain disorders, their diagnoses, and their treatment.
<P>
	We must also get our economic house in order.  The federal 
parity battle cloaked itself in a war of numbers.  And while we 
performed well, some of the gaps in the data were surely alarming. 
 For example, analyses of the impact of state parity laws were 
quite sparse.  
<P>
	We must also work with the business community in implementing 
and expanding non-discriminatory policies.  Stigma and 
discrimination are partly at the root of the business communities' 
opposition to parity.  After all, you heard no public outcry 
against the 48-hours mandate for newborns and their mothers.  Nor 
was there an outcry about the Kassebaum-Kennedy law.  It was the 
mental illness "mandate" that was attacked and fought.  In one of 
the business communities' analyses of the cost of the Domenici-
Wellstone amendment, they protested the shift of costs for treating 
people with severe mental illness from the public sector to 
employers, including jail and prison costs.  In other words, they 
implied that it is more appropriate for a person with schizophrenia 
to be put in jail than to be treated in the mainstream healthcare 
system.
<P>
	Yes, there were signs of prejudice and discrimination.  But 
some American employers are trying to do the right thing.  They 
offer generous coverage for serious brain disorders.  We must work 
with them, educate them about these illnesses, and help them 
understand that these are physical illnesses like epilepsy, 
Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.  We must work with 
them to best manage and control the costs of coverage for these 
brain disorders.   
<P>
	Be proud of your vigorous and courageous advocacy during the 
many years you have worked to improve the lives of people with 
serious brain disorders.  Even this modest law would never have 
passed without your dedicated work for so long.  We have reached a 
threshold of success.  We are headed toward a complete end to 
injustice and inhumane treatment of people with serious brain 
disorders.
<P>
It is proper that we pause and examine the case for parity,  not 
only because this modest little policy step is historic, but 
because we run the risk of a pyrrhic victory ignored, defied, and 
overturned.
<P>
As NAMI members, you know what creates this undying dedication and 
advocacy.  People with serious brain disorders and their families 
will never give up, be they U.S. Senators or ordinary citizens.
<P>
Yes, there were signs of prejudice and discrimination.  But some 
American employers are trying to do the right thing.
