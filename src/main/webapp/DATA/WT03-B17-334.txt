<PRE>
  Both  Plants and Animals need to be fed Rock Dust to achieve physical
completeness more quickly.
  What does that mean? They get healthy and stay healthy!

  Due  to  its high mineral content, rock dust helps in all aspects  of
     the plant's biological process.
  All  aspects  from  absorption  of other minerals  to  production  of
     enzymes is increased.

  Plants and Animals are healthier.
  Plants  and Animals fed rock dust have less stress and are therefore
     not  going to be attacked by insects, diseases, etc. Less prone  to
     attack.

  Plants can handle stress better.
  Plants  can absorb the minerals they need when they need it and  will
     suffer   less  then  those  plants/animals  not  having  the proper
     minerals their bodies need.

  Plants and animals  live longer healthier lives.

  Rock dust is a natural fertilizer.
  One of Mother Nature's best fertilizers. No nitrogen here!

  Non-polluting, biodegradable.
  Mother Nature will use every bit of it!

  Rock Dust is inexpensive compared to other mineral products.
  This  is  of  course  provided  that you get  a  source  nearest  you
     otherwise shipping can cost more then the rock dust!

  Rock  Dust  increases  mineral content of the  soil  and  the  plants
     growing on it.
  Rock  Dust  is  high in calcium, iron, and all the other 76  minerals
     needed by both plants and animals including us humans.

 <STRONG><H3> Mother Nature recommends it!</H3></STRONG>
