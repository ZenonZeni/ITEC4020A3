Newsletter Profile</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Chris Docker</FONT></P>

<P>One man who believes passionately in his work is Chris Docker, Executive
Secretary of VESS. Principal author of <I>Departing Drugs </I>and co-author
of <I>Beyond Final Exit, </I>he also pioneered the first extensive UK research
into living wills and developed the VESS Newsletter from its then 4-6 pages
to its present internationally acclaimed format. But those are things he
does in his spare time, often on top of an exhausting schedule of press
interviews and public lectures. What keeps him going in a job which increasingly
dominates his life and absorbs all his energy in his commitment to human
rights?</P>

<P>It started at the age of 15 when, having read something of the more
barbarous history of the Christian church and compared it with the gentler
precepts of creeds like Buddhism, he wrote to his Anglican vicar resigning
from his religion. Later, working for a small publishers specialising in
human rights and civil liberties, he was asked to investigate VESS. He
became hooked and, after many years working on the committee and helping
generally, took it on full time, abandoning a successful marketing career
to live on a quarter of his previous salary.</P>

<P>Unacceptable though his lifestyle might be to many, he has no regrets.
His salaried work, 40 hours a week in the VESS Office, he sees as the necessary
nuts and bolts enabling essential stepping stones to be laid. &quot;As
voluntary societies grow, the internal politics become ever more unmanageable,
but without VESS we would have very little hope of effecting any change.
Working as staff rather than on the committee can be stressful, but it's
given me the opportunity to make a lasting contribution in some areas.&quot;</P>

<P>The office work is not just routine work with added research. It's emotionally
exhausting, and to help him cope with it and give whatever help is possible,
Docker took a training course with the Samaritans. Mostly he is restricted
to giving the caller space and freedom to talk, since giving personal advice
is still illegal. His latest project has been to create a a website on
the Internet, providing reference material and informed comment to thousands
of supporters. &quot;It's a two-way thing: we get news as it happens and
in sufficient detail to work with, and we can now also expand our membership
to sections of the public that wouldn't normally join VESS.&quot;</P>
