CLO CONCEDES ALL TO ENEL

Italy's industry minister Alberto Clo gave a year-end present to the
state electricity corporation. By putting his signature to the
controversial concession which licenses ENEL to operate, Clo has not
only taken the corporation a further step down the path to an initial
public offering of its shares, but also appears to have ensured that
privatisation will not significantly effect the comfortable status quo.

Clo's decision to sign the concession has not won universal approval,
however. Indeed some wonder whether a hidden agenda lies behind the
move of a non-elected minister in a technocrat government that seems to
be rapidly approaching the end of its time.

The haste with which Clo has despatched ENEL's operating concession
from his desk has not been well received by the anti-trust authority.
The competition watchdog's firmly held view is that Clo has put the
cart way ahead of the horse. How Italy's electricity sector should be
reorganised should have been settled before drafting and signing the
concession. But a new structure for the electricity industry requires
parliamentary approval and the industry minister, who may not be much
longer in that job, was not prepared to wait for the politicians to
have their say.

UNAPACE, the autoproducers' association chaired by Giuseppe Gatti, the
former energy director general at the ministry of industry who was
replaced last February shortly after Clo became minister, was wholly
opposed to the minister's precipitate action. In a note sent to the
minister in the week before Christmas, the association wrote,
"UNAPACE's fundamental position is that this concession should not be
signed, but that attention should be directed towards the necessary
legislative reforms".

According to the autoproducers, the concession that Clo has given to
ENEL introduces incurable contradictions with possible new structures
for the Italian electricity industry. The present system will remain a
straitjacket in which ENEL will continue to operate "not only in
monopoly conditions, but substantially as a government offshoot, with a
public-type role incompatible with real privatisation".

In its note, UNAPACE raised various objections to Clo's concession for
ENEL and suggested that:

* the exchange and transmission of electricity produced by other
companies must be made possible to all operators on equitable and non-
discriminatory conditions, on the basis of prices approved and
regulated by the regulatory authority;

* cogeneration should be encouraged as well as renewable sources;

* sub-concessions of ENEL's activities should not be limited to wholly-
owned ENEL subsidiaries or to companies owned jointly by ENEL and
public local utilities;

* the planning of plant capacity needed to satisfy national
requirements should be entrusted to a government body or the regulatory
authority, not to ENEL;

* competitive bidding for new generating plant should apply only for
capacity aimed at supplying the tied, mass market, while simple
authorisation should apply to capacity needed for supplying large,
'qualified' customers, distributors and consortia.

UNAPACE expressed particular concern over ownership and control of
Italy's grid. The autoproducers' association considers that, regardless
of EU decisions or recommendations, a separate grid company should be
established in order to ensure that the costs of transmission and
related activities should be made transparent and to reduce the
possibility of cross-subsidies between production and distribution.
"This company should be made completely autonomous and independent of
every other operator in production and distribution, particularly
ENEL", stated UNAPACE.

The association's note to Clo expressed concern that control of
activities so important to the system's functioning by a private
company could heavily condition access. This would "risk prejudicing to
a substantial extent the effect of liberalising sales to large
'qualified' consumers". UNAPACE told the minister that an alternative
to an independent grid company would be one in which independent
producers and distributors, public utilities and ENEL would have equity
stakes. "However, none should have a controlling interest in the
company."

On the question of grid access tariffs, UNAPACE said that these should
be detailed by type of service and directly correlated to relevant
costs. To guarantee transparency, the regulatory authority should be
responsible for tariff setting.

Clearly, while the operating concession may have brought some seasonal
good cheer to ENEL, Clo's signature on the document has disappointed
UNAPACE, and runs contrary to the ideas of Italy's competition
regulator.

The anti-trust authority gave its opinion in December, though this has
not yet been published, because, it says, it would be improper to make
known its opinion before the concession has appeared in the official
gazette. This is expected in mid-January. The anti-trust authority is,
however, unlikely to let go of an issue on which it has on several
occasions taken a stand wholly divergent from the line Clo has
followed. Italy's competition watchdog is, however, able to bark rather
than bite.

* The year has opened with speculation about who will be appointed to
the chairmanship of the regulatory authority for the electricity
industry. Among the names that have been mentioned is that of industry
minister himself, Alberto Clo.

If the technocrat government headed by Lamberto Dini is replaced or
reshuffled, Clo could be looking for a job. Being able to show a CV
that contains placing the law establishing the regulatory authority on
the statute book and the drafting and signing of ENEL's operating
concession might make him seem the right man for regulator. And, having
been regarded by some as ENEL's man at the ministry, he could then be
known as its man at the authority.

COMMISSION STRENGTHENS IEM RESOLVE

In an unprecedented move at the end of 1995, the European Commission
put forward its first white paper on energy. Basing its document on
three broad objectives - overall competitiveness, supply security and
environmental protection - the Commission said it will use all the laws
at its disposal to liberalise the EU's internal market for electricity
and gas. But it warned that new constitutional powers may be necessary
to reach that goal.

Unveiling the document, Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutis said: "If
we are to achieve all these objectives, the Commission must raise the
question of whether a modification of the Treaty of Rome is necessary,
as Community action I believe is now limited by the absence of clear
provisions."

He said a sound and sustainable energy policy "is critical for our
future economic development. This white paper will be our blueprint for
action into the 21st century."

The 40-page document lays down a programme for the next three years,
covering everything from vehicle emissions to promotion of
cogeneration. It also singles out completion of the EU's internal power
market and achievement of a level playing field for economic operators
in the sector as fundamental objectives.

For example, the paper says the EU needs a set of coherent criteria in
order to apply the Treaty's competition rules more effectively in cases
where public service supply obligations are involved. It also insists
that all forms of energy, including fossil and nuclear fuels, should
have a fair chance to compete, meaning more transparency in their
pricing and taxation is necessary.

"Energy prices, especially electricity prices, should not be used as
parafiscal instruments to support specific forms of energy, since this
will create distortions of competition unless such measures reflect
external factors", says the paper. However, it makes allowances for
support measures in favour of renewables. The Community's range of
instruments that govern the reporting of fuel prices "will be further
developed with a view to including taxation transparency," it observes.

At the same time, the Commission wants a more transparent business
environment for investments in the EU's energy sector and says it will
use the "appropriate tools" such as energy-impact analysis to assess
national regulatory measures in the environmental, social and tax
fields.

Of particular concern, it said, is a need to ensure that procurement
procedures for infrastructure projects "respect key criteria in terms
of transparency and objectivity." Brussels said it will push for
establishment of a new "Energy Consultative Committee" under its
auspices (consisting of representatives from industry and labour
unions) to ensure "as much transparency as possible on the development
of Community initiatives" in energy policy.

Creation of the EU's internal energy market and a multiplicity of
players within it is necessary, says the white paper, for further
diversification of the Union's domestic fuel base, particularly for
electricity production: "Electricity producers should be able to choose
the most appropriate and cost-effective fuel within a competitive
framework as long as it does not undermine diversification "

Thus, according to the white paper, it is difficult to justify a
continued application of the EU's Directive 75/404, which forbids use
of fuel oil under certain conditions for electricity production.
Overturning the directive, it says, "would give electricity producers
increased flexibility, [while] an adjustment of indirect taxation to
ensure equality of opportunity between substitutable fuels would favour
future flexibility in power generation".

In the same vein, the Commission will wage battle against the trend to
encourage intensive energy use across the union. "The evidence suggests
that there remains a substantial potential for improvement," observes
Brussels in its paper. It said EU bodies will have to "mobilise all
their instruments" to support energy efficiency. The Commission plans
to issue a communication later this year analysing how fiscal tools can
be used to promote energy efficiency and renewables.

The Commission will also issue proposals in 1996 to ensure that energy
efficiency is incorporated as an industrial requirement when European
technical standards are drawn up for energy-consuming equipment. It
wants the EU's technical standardisation bodies located in Brussels -
CEN and CENELEC - to create an energy working group to ensure that
their draft technical standards promote energy efficiency, renewable
energies and energy transportation. This could run into problems
however: such an approach will have to reconcile efficiency objectives
with trade freedom and sufficient flexibility for industrial
innovation.

Tipping its hat to the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission says
less direct intervention in the energy market will be the rule of the
day. But it argues that more efficient monitoring tools will be needed
to analyse the sector and ensure that its structural and technical
changes do not conflict with the EU's energy policy goals.

A reinforced monitoring capability is needed, says the paper, to:

* ensure the proper functioning of the internal energy market;

* verify that new production capacity enjoys freedom of establishment,
especially for independent electricity producers;

* enforce fair competitive conditions for independent electricity
producers;

* confirm that different network-access systems yield comparable market
opening and market access in member states;

* establish cooperation on interconnected systems between national
regulatory authorities in both the gas and electricity sectors.

The paper notes that the instruments currently at the Commission's
disposal for ensuring transparency of investments, prices and energy
imports and exports "are unsatisfactory because the administrative
burden is not offset by an operational usefulness."

Such ineffectiveness, it said, is linked to delays in the publication
of data and poor coordination between member states. To correct the
situation, Brussels is proposing to provide national administrations
with a new energy data bank as well as an information network that
processes data more quickly. At the same time, it will lobby for a more
"complete, reliable and harmonised statistical system" at Community
level in the field of energy.

How national capitals will react to such a broad range of initiatives
is still unclear. Most have fought tooth-and-nail against any
intrusion, direct or otherwise, by the Commission on the territory of
taxation. While Brussels can justifiably argue in favour of more
transparency in energy prices, it will probably meet resistance to
"improved monitoring tools" that peek too much into national taxation
regimes and decisions.

Moreover, its call for yet more consultative committees and working
groups may fall on unresponsive ears, considering that the Belgian
capital is already groaning under the weight of endless such
committees.

Perhaps in anticipation of the opposition that its energy policy paper
is sure to spark, the Commission ends its document with a bow to the
need for a proper division of work between EU and national authorities
- subsidiarity - but hedges its position nevertheless. The white paper
places energy policy "within the existing institutional framework" of
the EU. But it concludes saying the Commission will make proposals "on
the question of whether a modification of the Treaty in the 1996
intergovernmental conference is necessary" via a report to be released
in the coming months.

Do not expect any bold move, though. The Commission made a stab at
inscribing energy policy in the Rome Treaty during the previous
intergovernmental conference in Maastricht, and got a resolute slap on
the wrist.

WIJERS PROPOSES DRIVE TO PRIVATISE

The publication at the end of December of the Dutch government's long-
awaited energy policy document confirmed many of the details leaked
through the month (PiE 212/18). The main thrust of the Energie Nota is
that the government is to privatise 35% of the electricity market and
40% of the natural gas market "in the very near future". Within five
years, two-thirds of the country's energy market will be privatised.
The energy infrastructure, however, will remain in public ownership to
safeguard supply and optimal central production.

The policy paper was formally presented by economic affairs minister
Hans Wijers at the end of last month.

The other two goals highlighted in the document - which sets out the
government's vision for the energy sector for the coming 25 years - are
to increase energy efficiency by one-third by 2020 and boost the share
of electricity production from renewable sources from the current 1% to
10%.

The aim, said Wijers, is to stabilise CO2 emissions rather than strive
for a reduction. The minister said that although this was a departure
from existing policy (and contradicts statements by the environment
minister) it is more realistic approach.

He said it was meaningless for the Netherlands to impose stricter norms
unless these were adopted by the EU as a whole. And he added that the
stabilisation of emissions in itself calls for considerable effort
particularly as the country's economy is expected to grow at a rate of
2%/yr in the next 25 years. Unless measures outlined in his policy
document are implemented, energy consumption and CO2 emissions could
actually rise, he warned.

The government's plans concerning privatisation were, to a large
extent, unveiled in advance of the energy policy paper. The document
now outlines the timetable as follows: in the immediate future,
consumers who use more than 10 GWh of electricity or 10 MMcm of gas
will be free to choose their supplier.

They will be followed within five years by users of 50 MWh of
electricity or 170 Mcm gas. In fact, companies in this category will be
able to apply for so-called "non-binding" status before the legislation
is in place although they will have to give a period of notice to their
existing supplier.

Users falling under the specified volumes will remain tied to one
supplier with regulated tariffs. It remains to be seen when this
category of smaller (non-domestic) consumer will enjoy the same freedom
of choice as other commercial users, says Wijers.

The electricity market will also be open to new distributors, both
Dutch and foreign. But the grid will, says Wijers, remain in the hands
of the current owners (the central electricity generating board SEP).
This is the best way to safeguard supplies and ensure optimal central
production, insists the minister. But he adds that an appeal procedure
will be available for electricity suppliers who feel they are unfairly
handled. This "natural monopoly" will also have an independent
watchdog.

Wijers claims that his proposals will place the Netherlands at the
forefront of energy market liberalisation in Europe, along with Britain
and the Scandinavian countries.

Concessions

According to major users, however, the plans fail to meet conditions
for increased competition in the market. Vereniging Krachtwerktuigen,
the association of large-scale users, which account for 80% of
commercial consumption, has urged economic affairs minister Hans Wijers
to focus more on opening up distribution to provide a counterweight to
his proposals to concentrate production.

Wijers' estimate that the reforms will deliver a cost saving of Dfl 500-
600m ($312-375m) is fine, but electricity users can only be sure they
are getting the lowest possible price when there are sufficient
alternative sources of power, a spokesman for the association said.

He said there are too few guarantees that new suppliers would have
access to the national grid under the same conditions as the central
electricity board producers and distributors.

Wijers' plan for an independent watchdog to ensure that every producer
will be treated equally is too vague and open-ended, the association
says, adding that free trade outside the sector will be obstructed by
established players.

Distributors could charge such high fees that it becomes impossible for
independent producers to make money from supplying customers via the
national grid.

While acknowledging the need for a powerful producer to enable the
Dutch energy sector to compete in a liberalised European market, the
association doubts that the plans will stimulate competition from
abroad and from independent producers as envisaged by Wijers. The only
way to achieve this is to give the electricity sector a fully
independent legal and economic status, it concluded.

The proposals contained in the policy document also indicate a
significant concession on the part of the minister on two points. The
first concerns his plans to merge the four existing producers (UNA,
EPZ, EPON, EZH) to create a single electricity production company with
distributors as shareholders. Wijers said this was necessary because
conflict between regional and national interests has led to over
capacity and operational inefficiencies.

The merger proposal caused an uproar (PiE 213/1) and the wording in the
policy document now calls for "one large-scale production company"
which leaves the option open for one or more breakaway production
companies to operate.

This could be the case in the south where the regional producer EPZ and
three local distributors PNEM, NUON and Deltan are already involved in
a far-reaching co-operation agreement. They have calculated that the
formation of a national electricity giant would result in extra costs
of Dfl 265m ($164.4m) for consumers in one province (Noord Brabant)
alone. Larger users would have to pay 25% more for electricity while
smaller customers would see a rise of 13%, they claim.

In the east, distributor NUON also prefers regional integration and
opposes the idea of "its" producer EPON being swallowed up by a
"bureaucratic monopoly".

Nevertheless, the move towards the integration of the production sector
will, says the policy document, have priority and energy director-
general Dessens has since said the outline of the new company will be
completed this year. A merger of all four producers would create a
concern with an annual turnover of Dfl 6bn.

Wijers has warned that reluctant shareholders may be forced to co-
operate with the government's merger plans, although he would prefer to
reach agreements with the parties involved.

Wijers argues that a large production company would benefit from
economies of scale, ensure more compatibility in terms of supply and
demand and - perhaps most importantly - would put the Netherlands in a
better position to compete with foreign producers once the EU
liberalises the electricity sector.

The second concession relates to the shareholding of the new production
company and is aimed specifically at appeasing Amsterdam city council.
The council is currently a shareholder (33%) in its regional production
company UNA but would have to sell its stake to a distributor under the
original proposals, something which it objects strongly to. Now Wijers
has said local authorities can also be direct shareholders in the
national producer.

Wijers' policy paper allocates Dfl 6m a year for a wide package of
energy efficiency measures for electricity generated by fossil-fired
plants. These include more long-term agreements with industrial sectors
and stricter standards for new buildings. Investment is needed because
"simple solutions will be exhausted by 2000" said the minister.

TAXING TIMES FOR NORWAY

The minority Labour government's plan to change the way generating
utilities are taxed is facing mounting hostility from some of the
affected interests.

The keenest criticism is being voiced by the so-called "hydro power
kommunes", local authorities which derive much of their tax revenues
from hydro plants located within their borders. LVK, the national
association of hydro power kommunes, called an extraordinary meeting on
January 10 to discuss the proposals, which it claims will undermine
local authority taxation rights and hit the country's sparsely
populated rural districts. A day earlier the opposition Centre
(Farmers') Party, which traditionally stands up for rural areas, held a
seminar on the tax reform. One of its conclusions was that the measure
was an "attack" on these areas. Media reports predict that LVK will
mobilise "massive opposition" to its approval by the Storting
(parliament).

The draft bill containing the proposed changes was tabled by the
finance ministry on December 15 (PiE 214/21). Initial reactions to it -
by all concerned - were moderate. This was mainly because the ministry
forecast, in the text of the bill, that the hydro power kommunes would
actually see their revenues from the sector rise under the new regime.
Since then, however, LVK has been doing its own sums to see how
specific local authorities would be affected. It claims that these
contradict the official figures.

In a letter to the ministry, LVK director Arvid Lillehauge says that
"... so far [our calculations] indicate that it is impossible to reach
the result indicated by the draft bill. On the contrary our
calculations show a fall in local authority tax revenues of such
magnitude that it does not accord ... with the intentions of the bill".

Lillehauge's request for the background material on which the official
calculations were based has been refused by the ministry, which says
that this material was collected on the understanding that details
would remain confidential.

The main changes proposed by the draft bill are:

* abolition of wealth tax on publicly-owned power utilities (private
companies - including privately owned power plants - have been exempted
from paying wealth tax since the general tax reform of 1992. Treating
publicly and privately-owned power companies in the same way, the
ministry points out, will have the advantage of eliminating an
incentive to privatise publicly-owned power undertakings for tax
reasons.)

* a switch from assessment on the basis of estimated value to
assessment on the basis of [annual] accounts, where publicly-owned
power utilities are concerned. That means, says the ministry, that the
latter will pay tax on profit, like other enterprises, and not tax on
the basis of estimated value as at present.

* abolition of tax exemption for power utilities in the kommunes which
own them. This will effect, inter alia, local authority-owned
distributing activity, which, recalls the ministry, is "to a great
extent ... exempt from tax at present".

* introduction of a 30% tax on the "ground rent" arising from power
production, with the central government and the counties receiving,
respectively, 95% and 5% of the take from this tax. Ground rent is
defined by the ministry as "the return on a natural resource over and
above a normal return... it is proposed to protect the normal return by
calculating an annual free income, which may be deducted from the
ground rent income".

* abolition of the present state production tax, which will be replaced
by the tax on the ground rent.

* the fixing of a minimum level for income tax [payable] to local
authorities (tax on hydro power income). "Hydro power income", says the
ministry, "is to be calculated separately for each individual power
plant for both publicly and privately [owned plants] as a proportion of
an estimated gross income. The aim of hydro power income is to ensure a
minimum level of stability in the income tax [take] of the hydro power
kommunes. It is proposed that hydro power income should be set at 35%
of the estimated gross income."

FOOTING THE NUCLEAR BILL

City lore has it that if the price is right you can sell anything.
Apply this to the UK's viable nuclear industry stripped of its Magnox
park, and the right price is obtained by prudently discounting a number
of factors - liabilities first, political and regulatory instability
next, perhaps public antipathy last. You are left with a business worth
considerably less than its newest, most prized asset, Sizewell B, which
cost #2.5bn.

Crudely put, this is the message coming from analysts, unions and
academics studying the government's plans to privatise Nuclear Electric
and Scottish Nuclear's merged AGR/PWR business as British Energy.
Public enthusiasm for the proposal, never high, has been diminished by
a perceived volte face by the government on its pledge to abolish the
Nuclear Levy on privatisation. The government's position is far from
stable; defections to opposing parties and a shrinking majority may yet
force it to take a more circumspect line on potentially divisive policy
decisions. Nevertheless, privatisation of nuclear and the railways
remain on the agenda.

With this as background, the Commons Trade and Industry Select
Committee investigating the nuclear proposal (PiE 213/4) is due to
report its findings on February 1. Among the most significant
contributions to the committee is a report* commissioned by Friends of
the Earth and the anti-nuclear local authority grouping COLA. It
suggests the government will be tempted to retain the #3bn ($4.658bn)
cost of reprocessing spent AGR fuel presently residing in the cooling
ponds of Sellafield to ensure the AGR/PWR business fetches something
like the #2.6bn value it has placed on it.

The report's authors, Gordon MacKerron of the Science Policy Research
Unit (SPRU) at Sussex University and Mike Sadnicki, a consultant, state
that such a scheme, while superficially attractive, is unsatisfactory
and possibly illegal under European Commission state aid rules.

Provisions in BE assets

The argument that the reprocessing costs constitute a historical legacy
and have nothing to do with the operation of a new company is
fallacious, the report says; "There are provisions in the accounts of
NE and SN of some #3.5bn to cover these liabilities for reprocessing
AGR fuel irradiated to 1995, and these provisions have in principle
been invested in the assets which British Energy will acquire. In other
words the assets contain the provisions for paying for the inherited
spent fuel. To exempt BE from the need to pay for them would be to
allow the company to enjoy the future incomes from the assets while
escaping a major liability which those assets are designed to pay for."

Exemption would result in the total public sector fund necessary to
assure payment of all liabilities growing from #7.8bn (the report's
estimated figure for a Magnox decom fund) to #10.35bn. This possibility
comes on top of regulator Stephen Littlechild's disclosure on December
19 that, despite perceived government promises to the contrary, the
Nuclear Levy will continue after privatisation in order to recover
around #450m of revenue arrears.

The announcement caused outcry from the Labour party, which branded the
government's promise of an 8% reduction in electricity bills "an
extravagance the government clearly can't afford to pay for".
Littlechild said the government had stated the levy would cease on
privatisation "subject to the recovery of outstanding arrears". The
Levy will remain at 10% on English and Welsh electricity bills from
April 1 1996 until privatisation, when a reduction in the rate is
anticipated. Energy minister Tim Eggar said power bills should fall by
6% by autumn 1996.

#809 million o.n.o.

So what value does the report put on BE's worth with all liabilities
factored in? MacKerron and Sadnicki's conventional base case using a 2%
discount rate on liabilities (the rate which the industry itself has
applied in the past) and a 13% discount rate on operational costs
values the company at -#2.6bn. Using a 13% discount rate on liabilities
and present costs - nearer the rate private investors are likely to use
when evaluating costs - the sale value is #809m.

The above cases have of necessity been partly based on statistical
assumptions given the shortage of operational data in the public
domain. BE itself is unable to comment in detail under the Financial
Services Act but was quoted as saying it would rather be judged on its
track record; indeed the report acknowledges the improvement in AGR
performance and Sizewell B's consistent operation at full power.
Neither is the report anti-privatisation per se; it concludes that if
it works well, the electricity market would be completed, some
liabilities would be transferred to the private sector and some cash
raised for the taxpayer. Analysts welcomed the attempt to detail the
industry's value but observers conceded there is as yet not enough core
data for the prudent investor.

If the approximations are at all accurate, the maximisation of the sale
value for nuclear power will almost certainly not correspond to the
division between Magnox and AGRs/PWR, the report continues. Assuming a
price of 2.5p/kWh, Heysham 2's estimated cash cost of 2.07p/kWh makes
it eminently privatisable. AGRs at Dungeness B and Hunterston B
(2.79p/kWh estimate) are not. "Quite probably a combination of Heysham
1 and 2, Torness, Sizewell B (and possibly Wylfa among the Magnox)
could all make money in the private sector, whereas Dungeness B,
Hartlepool, Hinkley Power B and Hunterston B might not", the report
says.

Add in the report's estimated 0.29p/kWh contribution to the independent
trust fund covering AGR decommissioning (PiE 213/5), and British Energy
is left with even fewer viable power stations. Of course, MacKerron and
Sadnicki could be wildly off the mark. After all, the report was partly
paid for by anti-nuclear pressure groups, as BE points out. SPRU,
however, has been near the mark in the past on the viability of new PWR
build and the desirability of a segregated decom fund.

AUSTRIAN ENERGY TAXES

The sudden change in finance ministers will delay but not derail plans
to introduce an energy (CO2) tax on electricity, gas and coal.
Regardless of the government's make up after the mid-December
elections, both the social democrats and conservative Volkspartei
favour extending the energy levy beyond motor fuels, taxed since last
May.

No one pretends any longer than the resultant funds would be applied to
CO2 reduction as originally intended; rather, the income would help
overcome a drastic budget deficit. Arguments have been flying over the
amount of tax to be levied (PiE 210/10) and this will be an ongoing
debate between the two parties as they attempt to reform the coalition
which came undone over budget issues last October. The conservatives
can be counted upon to hold back social democratic moves for a tax at
the higher end of the proposed scale, to avoid making Austria less
attractive for industry.

Coalition negotiations come first, but the energy tax could be a part
of the ultimate package. Nevertheless, given that formation of a new
government is not expected until the end of at least February,
introduction of the tax on electricity probably will not occur before
mid-year at the earliest.

OKA TO BE PARTIALLY PRIVATISED

Oberosterreich Kraftwerke AG (OKA) will be partially privatised this
year, according to the Upper Austrian provincial governor. Currently
the utility - which supplies the industrial centres of Linz and Steyr
as well as substantial agricultural areas with its own as well as
Verbund power - is wholly-owned by the province and, in addition, has a
36% holding in the Salzburg regional utility Salzburger AG fur
Energiewirtschaft (SAFE; PiE 192/12).

No date or procedure has been set for OKA privatisation, but any
arrangement is likely to include a condition which would avoid
shareholding by a German electricity utility: earlier moves to
partially privatise the Salzburg regional and municipal utilities
stumbled when a German purchase was feared. German utilities such as
Bayernwerk have made no secret of their interest in obtaining
transmission right-of-way across Austria, which would enable cheaper
electricity exchange between Germany and Italy.

Meanwhile, OKA has set major rationalisation and investment programmes
for the short-term future. Following a study by consultant AT Kearney,
OKA will reduce personnel from 2,410 to 2,000 through attrition.

Administration will be cut sharply, departments reduced from 60 to 38
and, local offices from 75 to 40. Savings in personnel costs over the
next six years are estimated in the "three figure millions", according
to management, with a Sch800m ($79.1m) cost reduction by 2001.

Growth, meanwhile, is expected from new business areas. The utility
will invest some Sch1.5bn in 1996, Sch1.1bn in plant and equipment, the
remainder in participation investments. The current major plant
investment is in the disputed Lambach generating facility (PiE 213/12).

REGULATION OF ELECTRICITY TARIFFS

The time-consuming procedures for altering electricity tariffs have
been simplified as of the start of this year. The new arrangement (PiE
211/12) allows utilities to institute tariff changes following
notification of the ministry for the economy. Detailed figures
supporting the change must be publicised and the adjustment justified.

The new regulation puts a cap on the amount of any increase and still
allows intervention by interest groups in Austria's "social
partnership" (labour, industry, agriculture) if the adjustments are
judged unwarranted. A 12% "deduction" from the gross increase is
required on the grounds that this amount must be achieved by the
utilities themselves through rationalisation. No increase may exceed
half of the then-current inflation rate.

For the arrangement to apply, individual utilities must agree to abide
by the new regulations. All nine of the country's regional utilities
plus the major municipal utilities have subscribed to the rules
governing the new procedure, but the responses of about 180 small
privately-owned electricity suppliers remains open.

The new arrangement has been criticised by the country's greens,
amongst others, who say the procedure gives utilities no more
initiative to introduce real cost-cutting or efficiencies, nor does it
subject tariff increases to the same scrutiny as did the previous
system.

RESULTS FROM THE FEDERAL VERBUND

High water flows through hydro plants and a 3% increase in electricity
consumption have assured a good year in 1995 for the federal Verbund.
The authority nevertheless has noted the impact of two major
cogeneration plants which have come on-line, measurably trimming
industrial electricity usage.

On the financial side, the Verbund last year experienced unbudgeted
costs of some Sch400m-500m ($39.6m-49.4m) when its long-term borrowings
in Swiss francs had to be revalued to reflect exchange rate
differences. About a fifth of Verbund bonds or Sch10bn are denominated
in francs. Notwithstanding, the Verbund will again pay its (49%)
private shareholders a 16% dividend based on the nominal Sch100 share
face value: this amounts to a 2.6% return relative to the year-end
market price of Sch606 per share. The government as 51% shareholder
will receive an 8% dividend on its stake, or half the private
shareholders' return.

No detailed export-import figures have been released, but the Verbund
notes an export surplus in its electricity trading for 1995. Higher
sales to Germany, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary have been registered,
although in part these have been achieved at below-cost prices in order
to reduce untenable coal stockpiles (PiE 214/14). Exports to Eastern
Europe made a profit of Sch500m last year, according to management.

Faced with a surplus of electricity as well as generating capacity, the
Verbund has succeeded in cancelling import contracts with the Ukraine,
postponing for another year an exchange contract with Russia and
suspending for five years a 500 GWh contract with Bayernwerk which was
to have come into effect last October. Verbund director Johannes
Sereinig estimates that these moves will save the federal authority
some Sch300-350m annually. At the same time, however, the Verbund has
been unsuccessful in negotiating changes to its 20-year 1,200 GWh
supply contract with Hungary (PiE 213/12) and has begun importing
unwanted and expensive electricity under the terms of the 1986 deal.

VERBUND PARTICIPATION IN RETAIL MARKETS

Regional utilities which have opposed federal Verbund participation in
their retail markets will not be comforted by recent statements by
Verbund director Hans Haider.

"Our direction heads toward heavier participation in the regional
utilities", Haider stated, underlining that the Verbund will "seek to
secure the market" rather than allow intrusion by powerful German
utilities.

"Were Bayernwerk last year to have acquired a holding in Kelag
[regional utility], we'd also now have them in [the generating utility]
Drauwerke", Haider argues. Kelag has a 49% holding in Drauwerke;
intervention by the Verbund last year pre-empted a bid by Bayernwerk
for a controlling holding in Kelag (PiE 185/11).

Next on the Verbund shopping list is STEWEAG, the regional utility
sharing supply to Styria, which could be partially privatised once
ownership in the provincially-owned concern is transferred to a holding
group. The Verbund already controls STEG, the other utility serving the
province, which it acquired in 1992 from Swiss owners (PiE 138/9) in
the face of strong protest from STEWEAG and other regional utilities.

While the Verbund sees greater involvement in Styria as bringing
considerable potential for efficiency, other regional utilities fear
that the federal organisation is seeking to ensure its future at their
expense while protecting itself against divestiture under EU rules of
its import-export and transmission grid monopolies. Haider has
justified wider Verbund shareholding in regional utilities on grounds
that this assures Austrian control over energy polices.

SALE OF SHARES IN VIW CHALLENGED

The sale of shares in Vorarlberger Illwerke (VIW) by the federal
government to the province of Vorarlberg has been challenged by Swiss
minority (4.5%) shareholder Finelectra. The Swiss concern asserts that
the deal between Vorarlberg and the Ministry of Finance for transfer of
user rights to VIW's high-voltage transmission lines (PiE 207/11) is
illegal as it was not put to shareholders.

Vorarlberg officials have registered surprise at the suit since talks
were held with Finelectra shortly before conclusion of the purchase
deal. Details of the Swiss charge are not known, but the challenge has
been dismissed by Vorarlberg's provincial governor as having no
significance.

AUSTRIAN UTILITIES TO ESTABLISH TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK

Austrian electricity utilities have pledged to band together to
establish a ground-based telecommunications network. The decision
follows the failure of either of the consortia in which they had an
interest (PiE 213/12) to win the single mobile telecoms license award.

Both Energieversorgung Niederosterreich (EVN) and the federal Verbund
had been reasonably certain that consortia in which they were
participants would gain the mobile telephone license. Both lost, with
the franchise going instead to a group supported mainly by the German
DeTe Mobil concern, Siemens Austria and the Austrian bank BAWAG.

The electricity utilities now plan to concentrate on development of
their fixed-based facilities with transmission via glass fibre cables
suspended from their high-voltage distribution pylons, in anticipation
of the anticipated telecoms liberalisation in 1998.

SLUMP IN POWER CONSUMPTION IN BELGIUM

Preliminary figures released by the Belgian federation of electricity
producers and distributors (FEB) show a slump in power consumption in
Belgium in 1995 from September, reflecting the wider cooling in
Europe's economy. Net power consumption in the country grew by an
estimated 2.9% last year compared to growth of 4.9% in 1994, said FEB.
In volume terms, net consumption in 1995 was 69,821 GWh versus 67,822
GWh in 1994.

Most of the slowdown was attributed to plunging demand from industry.
Though demand for energy from the sector remained strong during the
first half of the year (5.4%), it tapered off sharply after the summer,
leading to growth in industrial consumption for the year as a whole of
3.7%, or slightly less than in 1994. Demand from Belgium's domestic
sector grew by a moderate 2.0% last year, while its tertiary (services)
sector saw consumption grow by 2.4%.

Net production rose by 3%, from 68,563 GWh in 1994 to 70,605 GWh last
year, according to FEB. As usual, Belgium's private sector accounted
for the overwhelming share of production: 64,943 GWh or nearly 92% of
the total. Public utilities accounted for 4.2%, while the balance of
3.8% came from auto-producers.

Nuclear energy was the largest fuel source, generating 39,063 GWh last
year or 55.3% of total power production. This was followed by solid
fuels (22.9%), natural gas and gas derivatives (17.8%), liquid fuels
(1.5%), hydro-power (1.8%) and recovered steam (0.7%).

Belgium's fuel mix for electricity produced in 1995 saw the greatest
changes in the natural gas and liquid fuel categories. Use of natural
gas and derivatives last year to produce electricity, for example, shot
up by 19.4% compared to 1994. Indeed, according to the country's gas
federation, sales of natural gas to Belgium's power sector ballooned by
20.9% from 70,151 TJ in 1994 to 84,800 TJ last year.

Though its absolute share is minuscule, power derived from recovered
steam rose 18.9% compared to 1994 (523 GWh vs 440 GWh). Nuclear energy
saw its share in total production rise slightly by 1.4%, reversing the
trend of recent years. Liquid fuels and wind power fell sharply (22.6%
and 11.1%, respectively).

Separately, FEB said the sector imported a total of 9,416 GWh from
France, Luxembourg and Holland last year and exported a total of 5,307
GWh, leaving a net balance of imported power of 4,109 GWh. Belgium had
a net balance of imports of 3,983 GWh in 1994.

One gas-fired co-generation unit of 51 MW was put into service at Ham,
near Ghent, in 1995 while a scattering of small steam-power units went
into service at Brugges (0.44 MW), Bressoux (3 0.9 MW units), Deurne
(0.76 MW), Harelbeke (0.165 MW) Middelkerke (0.165 MW) and at Wanze
(0.23 MW and 0.31 MW). As part of Belgium's current ten year (1988-
1998) plan, two 350 MW gas-fired co-generation stations will be put
into service at Ghent and Brugges in 1997.

The country's next equipment plan for the 1995-2005 period, which was
given final government approval on December 20, places even greater
accent on natural gas-fired stations. It also calls for a reduction in
the growth of demand for electricity of 0.9% for the coming year and
lower tariffs, starting in the second trimester of 1996.

FEB said Belgium's electricity grid expanded modestly in most
categories: 0.5 km for 220 kV lines, 3.3 km for 150 kV lines and 15.8
km for 70 kV lines, including 13.8 km of cable. Total capital
investments in production, transport and distribution activities was
Bfr 35.6bn($1.205bn) or nearly 17% more than in 1994 (Bfr 30.5bn).
Electricity prices during the year rose with inflation, or by
approximately 1.5%.

DANISH CHP REPORT

Elsam's recent report to the Danish Energy Council - Integrated
Resource Planning - struck a far from sanguine note. It claims Denmark
is heading towards a major imbalance between electricity production and
consumption. Elsam reckons that 40% of the power produced by wind
turbines and CHP units in 1998 will be superfluous to local consumer
requirements. The company predicts that Danish electricity oversupply
will reach a massive 1,000 GW in four year's time.

Elsam lays the blame with what it calls a "too rapid and uncontrolled
development of CHP" in Denmark. After a heated and very public argument
between the Danish energy minister, Svend Auken, and Elsam in the weeks
leading up to Christmas, Elsam agreed to accept power from 64 new small
decentralised CHP units. When completed, they will have a combined
capacity of 1,225 MW, or about one-fourth of Elsam's entire capacity at
present.

The Danish Energy Council (controlled by the energy ministry) believes
there is scope for 1,500 MW of CHP-produced electricity in the region.
Elsam insists there is no need to build a single new CHP unit before
2003 at the earliest, and says that state operating support for CHP -
Dkr 0.10/kWh ($0.018) and 30% capital construction grants - has
encouraged far too many investors.

Politicians and Elsam have been at odds about the small decentralised
power plants since parliament first decided to promote them vigorously
towards the end of the 1980s. The decision was made on the basis of
several reports which suggested that CHP and biofuel formed the most
eco-friendly solution to Denmark's electricity needs. However, their
opponents now claim that a major disadvantage with CHP is that there is
no central dispatch system co-ordinating them. Electricity production
by CHP is dictated by the need for heat and this means they produce at
full capacity in the winter months while the larger centrally-placed
power plants are forced to cut back on production.

One result of the CHP argument is the resumption of the debate on
connecting Denmark's two separate East and West grids. In 1992
parliament urged Elsam and its Eastern Denmark counterpart, Elkraft, to
work towards establishing a cable to join their grids. As yet, however,
the plan has come to nothing. New calculations on the economic
viability of the plan show that income derived from inter-regional
electricity sales would only meet the ordinary operating costs of a new
cable.

Income would thus be insufficient to pay the estimated Dkr90m interest
associated with the capital costs of the project. However, energy
minister Svend Auken has requested the Energy Council to undertake an
additional assessment of the project. He accepts that the capital costs
would be high, but "it would be a once-off investment which would give
us a great advantage in the coming European energy market", he
concluded. On a more up-beat note, the Elsam reports says it expects to
achieve its targeted CO2 emission reduction five years earlier than the
government had anticipated.

According to the government's energy policy law Energy 2000, Danish
power producers must cut total CO2 emissions to a maximum of 24m tons
per annum by 2005. Elsam claims western Denmark's targeted 14m tons can
be achieved as early as 2000.

ELECTRICITY INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN ITALY AND GREECE

The European Commission is setting aside more than Ecu 75m ($98.1m) to
improve electricity interconnections between Italy and Greece. The
grant, approved on January 11, will be financed from the EU's Regional
Funds and forms part of the "INTERREG II" programme.

The lion's share of the money - Ecu55.772m - goes to Greece, with the
balance of Ecu20m for Italy. It will be used to strengthen power
distribution links between the two countries, notably between the 400
kW electricity supply networks that link Arachthos in Greece to
Galatina in Italy.

Two AC to DC conversion stations will be built, along with a line to
carry direct current to connect the two stations. The money will also
fund the installation of a 160 km underwater cable to carry 600 MW
between Oporto Badisco in Italy and the Greek town of Aetos.

ENERGY TAXES

The Commission approved on December 20 a set of Dutch fiscal measures
designed to encourage energy savings and a reduction of CO2 emissions.
The centrepiece of the legislation is an energy tax on small-scale
energy consumers.

The tax will be levied on consumption of the first 50,000 kWh of
electricity and the first 170,000 cubic metres of natural gas. Only
small-scale energy consumers - mainly households and small businesses -
are subject to the tax.

The revenues will be channelled back to taxpayers via a reduction in
direct taxes on capital and labour income, thus constituting a "tax
neutral" mechanism. Large-scale electricity users are exempt from the
tax, as other measures apply to them. Similarly, Holland's
"horticulture under glass" - ie, its sizeable agricultural and flower-
growing sector - is exempt from the tax on gas consumption in order to
maintain its competitive footing internationally.

The Dutch government says its will amend its legislation if a common,
EU-wide CO2/energy tax is introduced.

CGT CALLS FOR FRESH ACTION

The French CGT (Confederation Generale du Travail) trade union called
on its members at Electricite de France (EdF)-Gaz de France (GdF) to
undertake fresh action on January 9 and 11. The latest protests were
aimed at the decision to hold back salary increases this year to 0.7%.

The government has issued instructions to all state-owned firms, as
well as official bodies to hold salaries back in line with an official
target of 2% for inflation. All that EdF-GdF has so far promised its
workforce is an end of year bonus which will increase pay by 0.7% from
1995 levels.

Earlier this year, the CGT was trying to relaunch general protests
aimed at preserving "public service" and the state employees' slightly
privileged pension systems, which were interrupted by a truce over
Christmas. This met with very little support. According to management
figures, no more than 1% or 2% of the utilities' employees backed them;
the four other main unions - FO, CFDT, CGC, and CFTC - did not support
the protests. They were content with the pension guarantees that they
had obtained, and with the delay that had been imposed on liberalising
Europe's power supply system.

* EdF is to pay the state a dividend of Ffr1.5bn for 1995, while Gaz de
France is to pay Ffr970m, according to figures published in the
official journal.

FRENCH WINDPOWER PILOT PROGRAMME

A working group on renewable energy sources has proposed that the
French government buy between 250 MW-500 MW of wind turbine generators
to connect to the grid.  The proposal is being considered by the
government.

Director of energy and raw materials at the industry ministry, Claude
Mandil, noted that ADEME (Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise
de l'Energie), as well as the turbine manufacturers wanted to install
500 MW by 2005, while Electricite de France would prefer 250 MW with a
first tranche of 50 MW.

He added that wind turbines had made considerable technical progress in
recent years and were becoming increasingly competitive.

A committee of experts would supervise the proposed pilot programme.
Tenders would be carried out in stages, allowing the project managers
to benefit from experience in the preceding rounds. Operators would
probably be asked to tender on the basis of the electricity purchase
price that EdF would have to offer to make their proposal viable.

LA MANCHE NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP

France's environment ministry has confirmed that an independent
scientific commission is being set up to supervise the La Manche
nuclear waste dump near La Hague.

Activity at the centre has been in abeyance since November 30, when the
appeal court in Caen ruled that it must be stopped. The court was faced
with a plea by ecological groups arguing that the site was not
functioning properly. The court is due to rule on January 31 whether on
work at the centre can resume.

ANDRA, the nuclear waste agency which manages the site, stopped
stocking additional materials in 1994, and had almost finished covering
the site - with a view to monitoring it for 300 years - when the court
order to stop intervened.

FUEL CONSUMPTION IN ITALIAN POWER STATIONS

Figures for fuel consumption in Italian power stations in the first
nine months of last year show increased gross thermal production, 8.9%
higher at 143,203 GWh than in the comparable 1994 period, compensating
for the 12.0% fall in hydro production to 31,920 GWh.

While gross production from coal increased sharply by 30.7% to 17,444
GWh, it, nevertheless, only provided 12.2% of total gross thermal
production. Fuel oil continued to dominate the Italian scene. Although
gross production from fuel oil increased by a modest 2.3%, from 83,341
GWh in the first nine months of 1994 to 85,265 GWh in the same period
last year, it accounted for 59.5% of gross thermal production.

Natural gas maintained its clear second place, recording an advance of
15.8% in gross production to 33,917 GWh, equivalent to 23.7% of total
gross thermal production. Other fuels used in Italy's thermal power
plant provided gross production of 6,577 GWh during January to
September last year, an increase of 19.2% on 1994 and equivalent to
4.6% of the total.

In terms of consumption, Italy's thermal power plants burnt 18.38mt of
fuel oil between January and September last year (up 2.8% on the same
period of 1994), 8.27 Bcm of natural gas (plus 19.1%) and 5.95mt of
imported coal (plus 28.8%). The statistics show that there was no
consumption of indigenous coal.

ENEL RAISES INTERNATIONAL PROFILE

State corporation ENEL raised its international profile over Christmas
by providing 300 kW illumination modules for lighting the holy places
in Bethlehem.

Following an approach from the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO),
ENEL decided that equipment from its 'Luce per l'Arte' programme should
be made available to light up the Basilica of the Nativity, the grotto
and the walls of Bethlehem's square. The illumination project ran from
Christmas Eve until January 8, the date of the Islamic new year. In the
season of goodwill, ENEL hopes that its Bethlehem illumination project
will help to bring some business to its international project workload.

The corporation has had discussions with the PLO about electrification
work in the former Israeli occupied territories, and will try to use
the presence of its 'Luce per l'Arte' modules in Bethlehem as a lever
to keep the door open for a successful Palestinian crusade by its
engineering division.

The marketing possibilities of other 'Luce per l'Arte' initiatives
undertaken by ENEL over Christmas and the new year are less obvious.
Since the autumn, the Vittorio Emanuele monument in the capital's
Piazza Venezia has been floodlit by ENEL's modules, and at the other
end of the Via del Corso, the Piazza del Popolo was specially
illuminated for New Year's eve festivities. At the beginning December,
a tailor-made 35 kW fixed but programmable lighting system comprising
259 lamps was switched on in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere.
Thanks to ENEL's intervention, visitors are now better able to
appreciate the basilica's XIIIth century mosaics and XVIIth century
ceiling.

Earlier this week, the buildings in the Campidoglio capitoline hill
area of the capital and the nearby Roman fori were illuminated by ENEL
for ceremonies inaugurating the start of Italy's European Union
presidency. Perhaps ENEL, whose privatisation plans have earnt
criticism from the Brussels competition authorities, wanted to cock a
snook at the Commission's chairman Jacques Santer and his commissioner
colleagues who were in Rome. Or, by bringing a sparkle to the capital,
the state electricity corporation may have been offering thanks to
Lamberto Dini's government which has allowed ENEL to avoid the
privatisation upheavals that would have been likely under a less
complaisant government.

EDF WITH EDISON PURCHASE 75% OF ISE

Continuing its international acquisitions, Electricite de France (EdF)
has completed the purchase of 75% of the Italian electricity producer
Ilva Servizi Energie (ISE), in partnership with Edison. The two firms
paid L370bn ($233m) for their stake, which will be held through a joint
company called Finel, in which Edison has 60% and EdF 40%. The deal was
agreed conditionally at the beginning of 1995, but the conditions were
not met until towards the end of last year.

EdF commented that this was an important step in developing
collaborations with other power generators in countries which wanted to
encourage independent electricity producers.

ISE already has capacity of some 600 MW, including a thermal power
station at Taranto (in Puglia), two at Piombino (in Tuscany), and a
hydro power plant at Terni (in Umbria). In addition, ISE is building a
500 MW thermal power station at Taranto, which will be fired with gases
from the blast furnaces of the local steelworks.  It will use combined
cycles to generate both electricity, which will be sold to ENEL, and
steam, which will be used by the steelworks. The project is due to come
into operation in the second half of 1996.

DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY IN THE NETHERLANDS

Demand for electricity in the Netherlands peaked at an all time high of
11,160 MW on December 20 last year, but overall demand of 70 TWh was
down 0.4% or 300 GWh on 1994, according to provisional figures from
SEP, the Dutch central electricity generating board.

SEP said the 1995 peak was 3.3% higher than the previous year's figure
and the first time demand passed the 11 GW mark.

SEP supplied 90% of the power provided through the national grid, with
the remaining 10% coming from combined heat/power plants owned by
industry and energy distributors.

SEP generators produced 2% less electricity last year, reflecting a
rise in power imports, which accounted for 17% of SEP's output compared
to 15% in 1994. At the same time, SEP exports increased four-fold to
320 GWh in 1995 from 75 GWh in 1994.

The steady advance in the share of power generated from coal continued
last year, climbing to 45% from 42% in 1994 and 37% in 1993, SEP said.
The share of natural gas declined further, to 49% from 525 in 1994 and
57% in 1993. Nuclear power accounted for 6% of production, the same as
in previous years.

SEP's total production capacity fell to 14,44 MW last year, 590 MW down
on 1994. Heat supplies from power stations expanded by 1% to 13,997 TJ
in 1995 from 13,773 TJ a year earlier.

SEP said the fuel component in the national basic tariff (LBT) had been
fixed at DFl 0.052 ($0.032) per kWh for daytime production and DFl
0.044 for night-time production for the first quarter of this year. The
night-time tariff is DFl 0.001 lower than in the last quarter of 1995,
while the daytime rate is unchanged.

PNEM SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH WINDFARMERS

Southern Dutch energy distributor PNEM has signed a ten-year agreement
with Windfarmers BV in Moerdijk for the supply of electricity for its
Green Power scheme under which customers can opt to buy electricity
generated from renewable sources (PiE 201/15). Windfarmers will build
four wind turbines, each with a capacity of 1 MW, which will deliver a
total of around 6 GWh of power annually, starting in March next year.

PNEM was the first company to introduce the Green Power programme in
the Netherlands and has won 2,500 clients since the scheme was launched
in June. The company hopes to increase this to 10,000 by the end of
next year.

Customers currently pay Dfl 0.085 ($0.053) more per kWh for
electricity, but this will drop to around Dfl 0.05 when the new eco tax
is introduced on January 1 according to the government's proposals.

* PNEM has announced a Dfl 0.0024 price rise for its conventional
electricity to Dfl 0.1912 (up Dfl0.0047 to Dfl 0.2382 for peak periods
ie 07.00-21.00).

NORWEGIAN-SWEDISH POWER BOURSE

The difference between Norwegian and Swedish power prices has been
shrinking since the Norwegian-Swedish power bourse began functioning on
January 1 - creating what is claimed to be the world's first
international power bourse (PiE 212/20).

From that day, Swedish traders have been able to buy and sell on the
market - operated by Statnett Marked and located at Lysaker, on the
outskirts of Oslo - regardless of whether their companies have the
physical infrastructure needed to import and export electricity between
the two countries. Previously, this was a condition of their being
allowed to do business there.

On January 2, the first working day of the year, 20 Swedish players
traded on the market, according to Hans Randen, a director of Statnett
Marked. This compared to only nine before the new year. January 1,
moreover, saw the abolition of border tariffs charged on power
exchanges between the two countries. Power exchanges between Norway and
Finland and Norway and Denmark are still subject to these tariffs;
apart from this, however, Finnish and Danish traders can operate on the
bourse under the same terms as the Swedes and Norwegians. "We expect
that most of the trade will take place in the day market, and that this
will lead to increased liquidity", Randen told the Oslo business daily
Dagens Naeringsliv.

He predicted that by the end of the year there would be some 40-50
Swedish players dealing on the joint bourse, in addition to the
approximately 100 Norwegians already using it. According to Per Hjorth,
managing director of Statnett Marked, the latter include around 40
generating utilities, 40 distributing utilities, eight to ten
industrial companies and ten brokers.

Power volumes traded via Statnett Marked rose to some 38 TWh in 1995,
from 28 TWh in 1994. Average annual output capacity in Norway is 112
TWh.

"I believe we shall reach 50 TWh this year, and much of the volume
growth will of course be due to the new joint market with Sweden", said
Randen.

PRIVATISATION OF ELECTRICIDADE DE PORTUGAL

Officials of Portugal's new Socialist government have indicated changes
in the way Electricidade de Portugal (EdP) is to be privatised. But
apparent contradictions in their announcements remain to be clarified.
Economics Minister Daniel Bessa told a Lisbon newspaper the first step
in privatising the group would involve finding major institutional
investors willing to buy up to 50% of an initial offer.

Secretary of State for Energy Jose Penedos was quoted as saying the
government plans a gradual privatisation of the group as a whole,
rather than in parts, and intends to disperse the capital widely. He
said this would help stimulate capital markets and make the purchase of
shares more accessible to Portuguese investors.

The previous centre-right government had planned to privatise up to 49%
of Companhia Portuguesa de Producao Electrica (CPPE), the production
arm of the EdP group, and subsequently sell up to 49% of the country's
four regional distribution companies. Penedos said the limit would
remain at 49%. More details are expected when the government presents
its overall privatisation programme, due towards the end of January.

The new government also plans to change the regulatory system for the
power sector approved in mid-1995, making the regulatory body set up
for the industry responsible for energy issues as a whole, not just for
the electricity sector. Penedos said the scope for government
intervention in the regulation of the energy sector would also be
reduced but gave no further details. In particular, the new government
wants the regulatory body to cover natural gas, due to be introduced in
Portugal by 1997.

Meanwhile, EdP has announced price cuts for industrial and commercial
users of 5%-8% in nominal terms in 1996. Taking account of expected
inflation, this represents a reduction in real terms of 8.5%-11.5%,
says EDP. Prices are to be 5% lower during peak hours and 8% lower at
other times. Prices for domestic consumers will be held flat in nominal
terms in 1996. EdP also forecasts its 1995 profits will double from
1994's Es30.5bn ($203.9m).

HEAVY RAIN FILLS PORTUGAL'S HYDRO-ELECTRIC DAMS

Weeks of heavy rain after five years of drought have filled Portugal's
hydro-electric dams to the extent that production has had to be halted
at several plants. All five hydro units on the Douro river in the
north, the country's most important source of hydro power, were shut
down in mid-January because the dams were too full to produce the
required fall of water to drive the turbines that produce energy.
However, annual production was expected to be above average in 1996
after current high water levels subsided.

More than half of Portugal's 64 dams were reported full and some were
discharging water to reduce excess capacity. All but four of the 24
hydroelectric dams belonging to Rede Electrica Nacional, the state-
owned national power grid operator, were full.

Three people died in accidents as parts of Lisbon and other regions
were flooded in the second week of January. The Tagus river overflowed
its banks in the area of Santarem 80 kms north of Lisbon. Portuguese
authorities were monitoring the river upstream in Spain, concerned that
the heavy rains could force Spanish reservoirs to discharge water,
aggravating Portugal's difficulties.

Officials said Portugal's five years of drought were over but the
ability to meet irrigation requirements fully next spring would depend
on rainfall in January and February. Rainfall in the southern Alentejo
region over the past two months was more than in the previous four
years and risks of flooding continued in several regions of Portugal.

SPAIN'S 1996 ELECTRICITY TARIFFS FROZEN

Spain's 1996 electricity tariffs have been frozen for the first time
since 1973. The utilities' association Unesa said the tariff freeze was
"the electricity sector's contribution to the stability of the economy
and the general price index," although Unesa chairman Martin Gonzalez
del Valle said that the tariff had fallen 10.7% in real terms since the
Stable Legal Framework (MLE) was first approved in 1984.

The MLE allows the utilities to factor certain costs - such as asset
costs, some overheads and hydroelectric generation costs - into their
tariff rates.

The December 28 decree which set the 1996 tariff also modified the MLE
in order to cut the utilities' income by Pta29.2bn ($241.3m), or 1.42%
of the tariff, but this will be made up by making other adjustments
according to interest and exchange rates.

The industry ministry's MLE modifications are broadly in line with
those proposed in November by the regulatory body, the National
Electricity Commission (CSEN), which wants to see more competition in
the sector.

The tariff increase has been below inflation for the past five years -
in 1995 it rose an average of 1.48% on inflation an estimated 3.5%.
this year's inflation forecast is also 3.5%. Unesa said on January 5
that between 1959 and 1995 the average price of electricity had fallen
by 39% in comparison with the consumer price index rise over the same
35 year period.

Days earlier, European commissioner for competition Karel van Miert had
told the European Parliament's Foreign Economic Relations Commission
that Spain's electricity tariffs were the highest in the EU.

The industry ministry has also bowed to consumer groups' pressure and
agreed to a new electricity bill which for the first time will contain
information on the client's consumption over the past 12 months, the
average cost per day in that period, as well as the percentage paid
from the bill for domestic coal subsidies, and to subsidise the
utilities' nuclear moratorium debt.

The latter two, being fixed rates, penalise higher consumption. The
1996 percentages, based on the estimated 1995 tariff turnover of Pta2
trillion and a forecast 1996 growth of 3.65% are the same as in 1995 -
3.54% or Pta72.6bn in nuclear moratorium debt, and 4.86% or Pta99.8bn
in coal subsidies.

Unesa said the new invoice model is designed to separate the direct
production costs - supply, generation and maintenance - from the
external and political costs such as the nuclear debt and subsidies.

Announcing the MLE changes, industry minister Juan Manuel Eguiagaray
said the electricity sector would not have to make investments in new
generation until at least 2000. But he said some fuel oil-fired power
stations would be converted to gas. "By February we shall authorise the
conversion to gas of fuel-oil stations with a capacity of 1,400 MW."

ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IN SPAIN

Industry association Unesa's provisional figures show that electricity
consumption increased by 3.8% in 1995. High-tension industrial
consumption grew by almost 6%, consumption in services and commerce was
up by 2%, while domestic demand fell by 1.5%.

Total consumption last year was 149,834 GWh, while generation was up
2.6% at 168,686 GWh. The fourth year of the century's worst drought
meant that hydroelectric generation fell by 16.8% at 23,968 GWh,
although it shot up in the last two weeks of the year as Spain
experienced almost constant rain from November. Unesa estimates that
the drought resulted in hydro generation at 30% lower than in normal
conditions, costing the utilities more than Pta50bn ($413.2m) in lost
production.

Thermal generation rose by 11.1% over 1994 to reach 89,276 GWh, which
Unesa said was an all-time high, while nuclear generation was up by
0.2% at 55,442 GWh. Spain increased its imports from France by 250%,
and total imports stood at 7,623 GWh, while exports were 3,145 GWh.
Together, imports and exports rose by 143.6%.

BASQUE PLANS TO ACHIEVE ENERGY SELF-SUFFICIENCY

The Basque regional government in northern Spain has warned that it is
"very seriously" studying plans to develop an independent gas-fired
electricity system if the industry ministry in Madrid continues to
block its plan to achieve energy self-sufficiency.

In an interview with the financial daily Expansion, Basque industry
minister Javier Retegi reminded Madrid that the existence of
independent operators outside the integrated electricity system is
enshrined in the government's own year-old Electricity Sector Law
(Losen), even though certain regulatory norms have not been fully
developed.

Retegi's comments are bound to increase tension between the Basque
capital Vitoria and Madrid, which opposes much of the Basque project
such as the conversion of the unfinished Lemoniz nuclear power station
into a combined cycle plant on the grounds that Spain does not
currently need new energy sources.

Euskadi (Basque Country) retorts that it wants self-sufficiency because
it feels that it is at the end of the 'energy line' in the far north,
and it wants to diversify its sources of primary energy, mainly gas. It
is no secret that the Basque nationalists who control the regional
government want energy autonomy as well as political autonomy.

Ironically, the development of independent operations outside the
integrated system is very much in line with the government's plans to
introduce greater liberalisation and competition in the sector. The
problem is that the Basque energy plan is in contrast with the industry
ministry's national plans.

Under the Basque government's Estrategia Energetica de Euskadi, or Plan
3E, the Basque Country would generate 42% of its own electricity by
2000. At the moment, it 'imports' 85% of this energy from outside the
region. Retegi claims that 10% of electricity is lost in transport.

"Our goal of electricity self-sufficiency is quite reasonable", he
says. "We are already negotiating with various foreign companies who
specialise in gas, electricity and independent systems, such as Enron
and Mitsubishi."

Basque energy independence would be based on four gas-fired electricity
generation stations, only one of which is currently on-line. This is
the 360 MW Santurtzi fuel-oil plant which would be converted to
combined cycle operation.

The uncompleted Lemoniz nuclear plant would be converted into a 300 MW
combined cycle plant. Construction was halted in 1982 after ETA
separatist gunmen killed two engineers at the plant, two years before
Spain's nuclear construction moratorium came into effect.

A further two gas-fired generators are to be built - Zabalgarbi, two 90
MW units, and Zergarbi, with a single 90 MW unit.

Retegi said natural gas consumption would rise from the current 15% to
29% of total primary energy use by 2000, which would mean building a
regasification plant in Bilbao port and connection to the French gas
network. "the interconnection between gas and electricity obliges us to
develop a global energy scenario", he says.

"If we had a good understanding with central Administration to achieve
greater self-sufficiency, to use Lemoniz and to guarantee [alternative]
gas supplies, everything would be in order and it would not be
necessary to seek alternatives to the integrated system", concluded
Retegi.

Iberdrola agreed to sell Hidruna to Endesa through Enher in a 1993
asset-swap, but the remaining 30% was to have been acquired in two
stages by March 1997. The Pta21.7bn deal was brought forward because of
the healthy situation of both Enher and Hidruna.

THIRD WIND FARM AT TARIFA

A third wind farm has been commissioned at Spain's wind power capital
of Tarifa in the far south. The Pta1bn ($8.3m) farm was built by Planta
Eolica Europea (Peesa), a group led by Danish company Nordtank (44%),
Danish engineering firm Elsam Project (44%), and Spain's Sevillana de
Electricidad (12%). The farm's 12 x 500 kW air turbines have a combined
installed capacity of 6 MW.

Sevillana is active in all three wind farms, which have a combined
capacity of 66 MW. It holds 23% of Sociedad Eolica de Andalucia, and 9%
of kW Tarifa.

Spain could be the world's second wind power producer by 2000,
according to energy secretary general Alberta Lafuente who was
presenting the four-year Pta16bn energy research Plan Estela, which
will investigate all areas of energy generation.

The industry ministry announced that the capacity of all renewable
energies had increased by 80% in the past five years in Spain and
stands at 407 MW. Including hydro generation, renewable energies
accounted for 5% of the national total. Oil accounts for 54%, coal for
19%, nuclear power 15%, and gas 7%. Although wind power has increased
tenfold since 1990, it still accounts for only 0.2% of renewable energy
and 0.01% of all energy generated.

SPAIN'S NEW CONNECTION WITH PORTUGAL

Spain's high tension grid Red Electrica de Espana (REE) has switched on
a new connection with Portugal to increase the exchange capacity
between the neighbouring countries to 2,500 MW. REE invested more than
Pta4.5bn ($37.2m) in the northwest region of Galicia above Portugal to
increase the capacity of the Trives substation and build two new lines
as well as the new Cartelle substation.

The grid is to invest another Pta4bn to build the Meson-Cartelle line
before the summer.

SPAIN'S NUCLEAR MORATORIUM DEBT

The government has finally approved a Royal Decree that will solve the
problem of the Pta729bn ($6.02bn) nuclear moratorium debt. The debt has
been borne by three utilities since construction was frozen in 1984 on
five nuclear power stations in Spain, one year after the Electricity
Sector Law (Losen) incorporated the means to clear the debt.

Losen enshrined the right of Iberdrola (Pta540bn), Sevillana de
Electricidad (Pta178bn) and Union Fenosa (Pta11bn) to receive
compensation for their investments in the plants either through a 3.54%
share of the tariff, with the debt paid off within 25 years, or the
right to pass on to investors the chance to gain the compensation in
the form of securities.

The decree ensures that the State gives a triple guarantee to the
utilities or, in their place, the investors. First, a minimum annual
compensation is guaranteed via the utilities' turnover; second, the
state will make up any difference remaining after 25 years; and third,
the state guarantees to cover the interests incurred by the debts.

* Union Fenosa has reduced its financial debt by Pta30.7bn to
Pta507.4bn. Some 19.3% of this is in foreign reserves, lower than the
average for the sector.

ENDESA AND SEVILLANA PULLING OUT OF CERSA

Public utility Endesa and its associate Sevillana de Electricidad have
made a joint announcement with Gas Natural that they are pulling out of
Spain's third largest telephone paging company, Compania Europea de
Radiobusqueda (Cersa), in which each holds a 9% stake.

Endesa and Sevillana have also broken ranks with Spain's largest
private utility Iberdrola by leaving the telecommunications holding
company Secomtel that they formed in the late 1980s. Iberdrola, which
holds 16% of Cersa signalled its intention to stay in the
telecommunications sector by announcing plans to purchase 40-50% of the
Internet connection company Servicom.

The three utilities have operated in telephone paging since 1992
through the consortium Servicio de Radiotelefonia Movil (SRM), which
holds 96% of Cersa. Secomtel's shares will be divided between SRM and
another mobile telephone company, Teletrunk.

The main reasons for the break-up are the different strategies being
undertaken by Endesa - which has joined forces with Banco Santander and
Banco Central Hispano - and Iberdrola, which appears to be moving
toward an alliance with semi-public telecommunications giant
Telefonica.

Endesa and Sevillana are also moving out of SRM/Cersa for economic
reasons. The late arrival of the paging service in Spain meant that
three large operators with important investors emerged in 1992 just as
the more successful mobile telephone sector was taking off.

This meant that Cersa, with 25,000 clients, lost Pta420m ($3.5m) last
year. A leading contender to purchase the 27% of SRM shares on offer is
Sistelcom-Telemensaje, a consortium which includes two other utilities,
Union Fenosa and Fecsa.

ENDESA TO BUILD SPAIN'S BIGGEST DESALINATION PLANT

Public utility Endesa is heading a consortium that is to build Spain's
biggest desalination plant on the southern Costa del Sol at Marbella.
The Pta7bn plant will be able to desalinate 60,000 cm of seawater a day
and it is scheduled to begin operating this summer.

The consortium consists of Endesa with 25%, its affiliate Sevillana de
Electricidad (25%), Aguas de Barcelona (10%), and construction company
Lain (40%). The project is part of Endesa's diversification plans, and
will not serve for cogeneration purposes.

AUTOPRODUCTION IN SWITZERLAND

Autoproducers in Switzerland will continue to benefit from federal
tariff recommendations until end-1998. These have been in force since
mid-1993, have now been extended until the end of 1998. As Switzerland
has few industrial autoproducers, the scheme mainly benefits small
hydro producers and gas-fired CHP plant in buildings.

According to an Evaluation Report just published, 80% of small hydro
plant (less than 300 kW) surveyed have seen the prices paid for their
energy rise and profitability improve since the recommendations took
effect. The federal recommendations are applied "almost entirely" by
electricity companies in eight cantons, but are followed only partly in
nine cantons, and entirely ignored in the principal hydro-producing
cantons of Graubunden, Ticino and Valais.

Here the difference between the production cost of about Sfr0.04/kWh
($0.035/kWh) and the Sfr0.16/kWh recommended for autoproducers is just
too great. The authors of the report claim that a promotion of
decentralised energy production is a national objective, which does not
justify forcing the three "hydro cantons" to accept conditions which
would result in unfair local tariff increases.

The five remaining cantons (Geneva, Neuchatel, St Gallen, Schwyz and
Aargau) provided no information to the evaluators.

The report noted that participating cantons have asked for the creation
of a national fund to finance the extra cost of the scheme to
distribution companies. The report recommended increasing tariffs paid
to CHP operators by 20-50% (solar producers have long been campaigning
for such a rate increase). It noted that in cases where more than 30%
of the energy produced by a CHP unit was consumed on the premises, the
reward for supplying excess energy to the grid was not sufficient to
make CHP attractive to investors. This meant that while the trend to
multiplication of CHP in buildings and heating grids continued, it
received no extra boost from the tariff recommendations.

The report also pointed to disputes over whether or not the
recommendations should apply to an independent autoproducer's total
output or just amounts in excess of own needs. Finally, it recommended
renaming the recommendations as federal "directives" to make them seem
more consequential.

Responding to the report, Martin Renggli, who heads the Federal Energy
Office (FEO) policy service, told PiE that:

Efforts will continue to be made to use the tariffs to promote small
hydro plant, even though technically many are not "autoproducers". He
said there is unlikely to be any question of increasing the tariffs
paid to CHP operators producing from fossil fuel (gas), in view of
parliament's insistence that such measures target renewables, and not
fossil fuels.

He noted that the legislation clearly intends that the special tariff
applies only to excess production. Thus, to avoid unfair profiteering,
independent producers must use the energy themselves as far as
technically possible. A leaflet is currently being prepared to make
this absolutely clear.

Despite another of the report's recommendations, he said there will be
no change in the "5% rule" which requires the REC to pay when
autoproducer input exceeds 5% of a local distributor's total energy
supply.

On the financial points, he noted the Sfr0.16 average tariff paid to
autoproducers who use renewable energy sources is the equivalent of the
long-term marginal production cost. Meanwhile, as the idea of a tariff
fund was broadly opposed during an earlier consultation period for the
new Energy Law, it is unlikely to be considered now.

Switzerland is virtually the only country to apply such a tariff and
the biggest electric companies have not really embraced the
recommendation. According to the report, the amount they "reinject"
from autoproducers is a "minute" 0.2-1.3% of total energy turnover, or
just 0.5-0.7% of costs.

SWISS REGIONAL ELECTRIC COMPANIES TO FREEZE TARIFFS

Five major regional electric companies have agreed to freeze tariffs
for the next three years. The five companies are BKW, NOK, Atel, CKW
and EOS. Announcing the agreement, the ombudsman's office in Berne said
it was made possible by the RECs' "good, and in some cases very good,
1994 results".

Joseph Deiss, one of the members of the ombudsman's team, told PiE that
the announcement was not really the result of a general "agreement" but
rather of separate negotiations with each REC. It was the ombudsman who
had taken the initiative, on the assumption that the excellent 1994-95
results announced by these companies, and the very good hydro
conditions, should benefit the consumer.

Deiss pointed out that as there are over 1,200 electricity companies in
Switzerland, the office had chosen to deal only with the big players on
the assumption that the effect will trickle down. "Our objective is to
reverse the trend of the many recent tariff increase, in excess of the
rate of inflation and at a time when there is an abundance of energy on
the market. We are pleased with our success."

RESULTS FROM CKW GROUP

Switzerland's CKW Group had total energy turnover of Sfr480m ($417m),
an increase of Sfr33.6m improving the Group net profit by Sfr6.3m to
Sfr25m. This was obtained with the help of a 5% tariff increase in
October of 1994, a demand increase in the CKW distribution grid of
5.2%, and to a slight improvement in prices for energy sold on the
international spot market.

Carl Mugglin, chairman of the board of directors, told a January press
conference that CKW would not increase tariffs in 1996, thus giving
"voluntary support to the price ombudsman's efforts to stabilise
tariffs".

Mugglin repeated warnings about the danger of further increases in the
production cost of Swiss electricity, and particularly
hydroelectricity, due to various new taxes. CKW and other Swiss
electric companies have decided to abandon any major new hydro projects
in the near future, such as the Mauvoisin dam.

CKW's profit-and-loss account for 1994/95 amounted to Sfr551.4m.
Operating expenditure was Sfr428.1m. Total investments, in plant and
for drawing rights, were Sfr81.7m. The dividend will be unchanged at 8%
(Sfr40 per Sfr500 share).

Production increased 7.3% and energy from increased use of drawing
rights by 45%. The Leibstadt and Gosgen nuclear reactors supplied 7.6%
more power, due to greater efficiency. CKW's own nuclear production
amounted to 874 GWh, with another 466 GWh from drawing rights.

Nuclear generation accounted for two thirds of the energy supplied to
CKW's grid. The total cost of production increased almost Sfr23m to
Sfr270m. Total demand in the CKW Group distribution grids to 2,400 GWh,
up 4.8%. Total CKW Group energy turnover was 4,300 GWh, up 7.1%.

Demand in the CKW company's distribution grid increased 5.2%, thanks
mainly to a 13.7% increase in demand by three major accounts, and a
4.3% increase in demand by "general industry", indicating a strong
recovery in the Lucerne region's economy. The household/trade/
agriculture/services sector showed a demand increase of just 1.1%.

TURKEY NEEDS 183 POWER STATIONS TO MEET PROJECTED DEMAND

Turkey will have to build a total of 183 power stations over the next
15 years costing around $16bn to meet projected soaring demand,
according to a report compiled by the country's Energy & Natural
Resources Ministry. The report says generating capacity must increase
at around 8% over the period to 43,590 MW from 15,235 MW at end-1995 to
serve a rise in demand to 271,450 GWh from 94,605 GWh at present.

In particular, the report says that a power bottleneck could emerge in
1997, unless existing projects are completed on schedule, no existing
power plants are closed down for environmental reasons, and there is no
shortage in gas supply or upgraded lignite.

To prevent shortages, construction work should also start on planned
build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes as soon as possible, the report
adds. And state-owned Turkish Electricity Generation & Transmission
Corp (TEAS) should install a sufficient amount of shunt capacitors in
all power distribution systems operating at ratings of 34.5 kV or
below.

The demand forecast is based on rapid population growth, rising living
standards and industrial expansion. Per capital consumption is
projected to rise to 3,267 kWh in 2010 from 1,978 kWh, for example.

The power stations required break down into 106 hydro-electric
stations, 16 thermal plants and two nuclear stations. Further thermal
stations will also be required: 33 lignite or hard coal fired stations,
14 natural-gas fuelled plants and 12 stations fuelled by imported steam
coal.

The present nominal capacity is 20,857 MW, but due to ageing, effective
capacity is only 73% of this figure. The report therefore also says
rehabilitation and modernisation of existing plants will also be
essential.

Because of the high investment costs, foreign financing and capital
investment will be essential, according to the report. The government
will look to the private sector franchise, BOT method as one answer, as
well as the privatisation of existing units requiring updating and
expansion, the report adds.

Contracts so far signed on a BOT basis involve projects with a total
capacity of around 3,710 MW, including two gas-fired plants of around
500 MW each at Eregli on the Sea of Marmara, and a 180 MW plant at
Esenyurt in an Istanbul suburb. Also included is the 672 MW Birecik dam
scheme on the Euphrates river in the southeast, says the report.

Bids were also invited by the ministry for the BOT implementation of
the following plants: Beysehir-Konya (2 x 170 MW); Saray-Tekirdag (2 x
150 MW), Afsin Elbistan (4 x 340 MW), Tufanbeyli (2 x 150 MW, or 1 x
300 MW).

Generally, the report foresees:

* commissioning of the first natural gas-fired plant with a rating of
680 MW in 1996;

* start-up of the fifth and sixth units at the Afsin-Elbistan lignite
plant, each with a rating of 340 MW;

* start-up of the first hydro-electric plant in 2000;

* commissioning of the first nuclear plant with a rating of 1,000 MW in
2005;

* start-up of the first imported coal fired station with a rating of 2
x 500 MW as well in 2005.

* In a separate development, the ministry reckons there is a potential
in Turkey for 30% energy savings annually amounting to 13.2m toe
equivalent or $2.6bn, based on 1994 production and consumption figures.
Had electricity been generated and consumed in the most productive way,
savings would have amounted in the construction sectors and industry
generally to 5.3m toe, or around $1.2bn each; and in the transportation
sector, 2.8m toe, or $262m.

MISSION ENERGY ACQUIRES FIRST HYDRO

Mission Energy of the US has joined Eastern Group at the head of the
independent generator league after its #652.5m ($1.01bn) acquisition on
December 21 of First Hydro, the National Grid's former pumped storage
business.

First Hydro's two plants in North Wales have a combined capacity of
2,088 MW, adding to Mission's 80% holding in the 220 MW Roosecote CCGT
in the northwest and a 33% interest in Derwent Cogeneration Limited, a
214 MW plant in Derby. The final price was considerably in excess of
the #450m value put on the business in NGC's flotation prospectus.

The two stations give Mission a key role in ensuring the security of
supply in England and Wales, particularly in winter when Dinorwic and
Ffestiniog frequently set the pool price. Mission has indicated the
size of the bid - #325/kW - was made possible by its favourable tax
position; it will also have taken into account increasing price
differentials in recent price spikes (PiE 214/28). Its bid topped those
of two others, Scottish Hydro-Electric and Dominion Energy of the US.

Mission and Eastern Group, along with Enron and Applied Power Systems,
are bidding for National Power's (NP's) 4 GW of capacity (PiE 212/24).
James Iaco, Mission's senior vice-president, said the First Hydro deal
made the company keener to win the auction for the three NP coal-fired
stations.

The 12 regional electricity companies who owned First Hydro after it
had demerged from the Grid stated on December 28 that they would retain
the proceeds from the sale. They will, however, have to pay capital
gains tax on their profits.

LITTLECHILD PUBLISHES MODIFICATIONS TO LICENCES

Regulator Stephen Littlechild has published his proposed modifications
to the licences of South Western Electricity (SWEB) and Eastern Group
following their respective takeovers by Southern Electric International
and Hanson.

The modifications, already agreed by Southern and Hanson, deal with
financial ring-fencing of the electricity businesses, restrictions on
activities, availability of resources, disposal of assets and provision
of information to the regulator. The modifications will be applied to
other merged companies in due course.

Littlechild said: "the merged companies will continue to have to meet
their existing obligations under the Electricity Act and licences.
These additional licence modifications will allow me to continue to
regulate effectively and to ensure that customers continue to be fully
protected."

Meanwhile, Ian Lang, President of the Board of Trade, in early January
cleared the proposed #1.6bn southeastern distributor Seeboard by Dallas
utility Central & South West (CSW; PiE 212/25). The bid will not now be
referred to the Monopolies & Mergers Commission, as were the bids by
local generators National Power for Southern Electric and PowerGen for
Midlands (PiE 213/9).

CSW's offer went unconditional the day after the clearance. Unusually,
all executive directors of Seeboard will retain their positions, while
chairman Keith Stuart and six non-executive directors resigned. Jim
Ellis will combine the role of chairman with his current position of
chief executive.

The clearance of Welsh Water's #880m agreed bid for South Wales
Electricity (SWALEC; PiE 214/28), meanwhile, is not proving quite as
smooth. The Office of Fair Trading has delayed its ruling on the bid -
the second by a privatised UK water firm for a privatised UK
distributor - until January 25.

The bid prospects clouded further in early January as Welsh Water
rejected a proposal by the water regulator Ian Byatt that it maintain a
separate stock market listing for the companies following any takeover.
This proposal was believed to be the main condition in a clearance of
the deal by both water and electricity regulators, both of whom are
concerned to retain sufficient comparators to regulate their respective
industries.

However, Welsh Water, noting that North West Water (NWW) was not
required to maintain separate listing prior to clearance of its bid for
Norweb (PiE 211/25), claimed a separate listing would make efficient
management of the new group difficult. The company is continuing
discussions and says it will seek alternative ways to meet Byatt's
objectives.

* The merged NWW and Norweb were merged into a new holding company,
United Utilities, on January 1. The combined group will have a turnover
of over #2.5bn and is capitalised at over #3bn. The companies will
continue to trade under their former names.

NATIONAL POWER TO CUT 400 JOBS

National Power (NP) has announced it is to cut 400 jobs in a cost-
cutting exercise that is expected to save #100m ($155.3m) over two
years from its #1.4bn annual costs. The redundancies will come from
support divisions  in its Swindon headquarters, and equate to about a
third of its headquarters staff and almost 10% of its total 4,900.

Most of the cost savings, however, are expected to come from reviews of
business processes, with some #35m as a result of property
rationalisation.

NP said the review was sparked by the increasing competition in the
electricity market, and was the result partly of its enforced sale of
4,000 MW of coal plant, which is expected to be agreed by March (PiE
209/2).

NP has already cut its workforce by over two-thirds from the 16,000
staff it had at privatisation in 1991.

The move follows the company's mid-December buy back of a further 57m
shares, or 4.4% of its issued capital. The buyback, at a cost of #243m,
would increase gearing by 9 percentage points, said the company, but
would boost earnings per share by 2-3% in a full year.

* The company's finances may also be assisted by a surprising #300m
loan awarded in late December by the European Investment Bank for the
installation of flue gas desulphurisation equipment at its 3,750 MW
Drax coal-fired plant in Yorkshire.

NP, which applied for the loan several years ago, is due to complete
the so far self-financed #750m work on Drax this year.
