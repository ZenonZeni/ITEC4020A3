<B>The following is a list of terms which are commonly used
in discussion of the uranium industry and the nuclear fuel cycle.</B>
<HR>

(eg in the steel of a reactor core) which has been created by
neutron bombardment.
<P>
<B>Alpha particle: </B> A positively-charged particle from the
nucleus of an atom, emitted during radioactive decay.
<P>
<B>Atom: </B> A particle of matter which cannot be broken up by
chemical means.  Atoms have a nucleus consisting of positively-charged
protons and uncharged neutrons of the same mass.  The positive
charges on the protons are balanced by a number of negatively-charged
electrons in motion around the nucleus.
<P>
<B>Atomic bomb:</B>  An explosive device whose energy comes from
the fission of heavy elements such as uranium or plutonium.
<P>
<B>Beta particle:</B>  A particle emitted from an atom during
radioactive decay.
<P>

around a reactor or radioactive material to reduce the radiation
(especially neutrons and gamma rays respectively) to a level safe
for humans.
<P>
<B>Boiling water reactor (BWR):</B>  A common type of light water
reactor (LWR), where water is allowed to boil in the core thus
generating steam directly in the reactor vessel.
<P>
<B>Breed:</B>  To form fissile nuclei, usually as a result of
neutron capture, possibly followed by radioactive decay.
<P>
<B>Breeder reactor:</B>  see Fast Breeder Reactor and Fast Neutron
Reactor.
<P>

in particular where the neutrons originating from nuclear fission
cause an ongoing series of fission reactions.
<P>
<B>Control rods:</B>  Devices to absorb neutrons so that the chain
reaction in a reactor core may be slowed or stopped.
<P>
<B>Conversion</B>:  Chemical process turning U308 into UF6 preparatory

(to U-238) has been increased above the natural 0.7%.  Reactor-grade
uranium is usually enriched to about 3% U-235, weapons-grade uranium
is usually more than 90% U-235.
<P>
<B>Enrichment</B>:  Physical process of increasing the proportion
of U-235 to U238.
<P>
<B>Fast breeder reactor (FBR):</B>  A fast neutron reactor (qv)
configured to produce more fissile material than it consumes,
using fertile material such as depleted uranium.
<P>
<B>Fast neutron reactor:  </B>A reactor with no moderator and
hence utilising fast neutrons and able to utilise fertile material
such as depleted uranium.
<P>

and undergoing nuclear fission, e.g. U-235, Pu-239.
<P>
<B>Fission:  </B>The splitting of a heavy nucleus into two, accompanied
by the release of a relatively large amount of heat and generally
one or more neutrons.  It may be spontaneous but usually is due
to nuclear absorption of a neutron.

the matter through which it passes and damage to living tissue.
<P>

both uranium and plutonium oxides, usually with about 5% Pu.
<P>
<B>Moderator: </B> A material such as water or graphite used in
a reactor to slow down fast neutrons so as to expedite further
thermal fission.
<P>

of U-234.
<P>
<B>Neutron: </B> An uncharged elementary particle found in the
nucleus of every atom except hydrogen.  Solitary mobile neutrons
travelling at various speeds originate from fission reactions.
 Slow neutrons can in turn readily cause fission in atoms of some
isotopes, e.g.  U-235, and fast neutrons can readily cause fission
in atoms of others, e.g.  Pu-239.  Sometimes atomic nuclei simply
capture neutrons.
<P>
<B>Nuclear reactor:</B>  A device in which a nuclear fission chain
reaction occurs under controlled conditions so that the heat yield
can be harnessed or the neutron beams utilised.  All commercial
reactors are thermal reactors, using a moderator to slow down
the neutrons.
<P>
<B>Oxide fuels:</B>  Enriched or natural uranium in the form of
the oxide U02, used in many types of reactor.
<P>
<B>Plutonium:</B>  A transuranic element, formed in a nuclear
reactor by neutron capture.  It has several isotopes, some of
which are fissile and some of which undergo spontaneous fission,
releasing neutrons.  Weapons-grade plutonium is produced with
&gt;90% Pu-239, reactor-grade plutonium contains about 30% non-fissile
isotopes.

of light water reactor (LWR).
<P>
<B>Radiation:  </B>The emission and propagation of energy by means

<P>
<B>Radioactivity: </B> The spontaneous decay of an unstable atomic
nucleus, giving rise to the emission of radiation.
<P>

several radioactive isotopes.  Radium-226 decays to radon222.
<P>
<B>Radon (Rn): </B> A heavy radioactive gas given off by rocks
containing radium (or thorium).
<P>
<B>Radon daughters:</B>  Decay products of radon-222.
<P>
<B>Reactor</B>:  see Nuclear Reactor.
<P>
<B>Reprocessing</B>:  Separation of uranium and/or plutonium from
used reactor fuel and the production of a much reduced quantity
of high-level waste.
<P>
<B>Separative Work Unit (SWU)</B>:  This is a complex unit which is a
function of the amount of uranium processed and the degree to which it is
enriched, ie the extent of increase in the concentration of the U-235
isotope relative to the remainder.  The unit is strictly: Kilogram
Separative Work Unit, and it measures the quantity of separative work
(indicative of energy used in enrichment) when feed and product quantities
are expressed in kilograms.
<P>
For instance, to produce one kilogram of uranium enriched to 3% U-235
requires 3.8 SWU if the plant is operated at a tails assay 0.25%, or 5.0
SWU if the tails assay is 0.15% (thereby requiring only 5.1 kg instead of
6.0 kg of natural U feed).
<P>
About 100-120,000 SWU is required to enrich the annual fuel loading for a
typical 1000 MWe light water reactor.  Enrichment costs are related to
electrical energy used.  The gaseous diffusion process consumes some 2400
kWh per SWU, while gas centrifuge plants require only 100-200 kWh/SWU.
<P>
<B>Sievert (Sv)</B>:  Unit indicating the biological damage caused
by radiation.  One Joule of beta or gamma radiation absorbed per
kilogram of tissue has 1 Sv of biological effect; 1 J/kg of alpha
radiation has 20 Sv effect and 1 J/kg of neutrons has 10 Sv effect.
<P>
<B>Stable: </B> Incapable of spontaneous radioactive decay.
<P>
<B>Tailings: </B> Ground rock remaining after particular ore minerals
(e.g.  uranium oxides) are extracted.

which are fissile (U235 and U-233) and two which are fertile (U-238
and U-234).  Uranium is the basic raw material of nuclear energy.
<P>
<B>Uranium hexafluoride (UF6): </B> A compound of uranium which
is a gas above 56oC and is thus a suitable form in which to enrich
the uranium.
<P>
<B>Uranium oxide concentrate (U308)</B>:  The mixture of uranium
oxides produced after milling uranium ore from a mine.  Sometimes
loosely called yellowcake.  It is khaki in colour and is usually
represented by the empirical formula U308.  Uranium is exported
from Australia in this form.
<P>
<B>Vitrification: </B> The incorporation of high-level wastes
into borosilicate glass, to make up about 14% of the product by
mass.
<P>
<B>Waste:  Low-level waste </B>is mildly radioactive material
usually disposed of by incineration and burial.

and disposal.
<P>
<B>Yellowcake:</B>   Ammonium diuranate, the penultimate uranium
compound in U308 production, but the form in which mine product
was sold until about 1970.  See also Uranium oxide.
