<P><B>SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS</B>

<P>Net earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 1996 were $6,295,000  ($0.04 per share), representing an increase from $5,590,000 ($ 0.03 per share) in the first quarter of 1995.  During the first quarter of 1996, the Company realized significant gains on the disposition of minority equity investments, the most significant of which was the Gold Reserve shares acquired through the Brisas property settlement.
Gold equivalent production was 117,300 ounces (101,500 ounces of gold and 1,131,500 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1996 compared to 102,800 ounces (85,900 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the first quarter of 1995.
Average realized revenue on gold equivalent sales of 91,400 ounces increased to $390 per ounce in the first quarter of 1996 compared to $ 378 per ounce on 101,400 gold equivalent ounces sold in the first quarter of 1995.  A significant portion of the difference between ounces produced and ounces sold relates to an increase in inventories at La Coipa.
Cash costs on a gold equivalent per ounce basis in the first quarter of 1996 increased over the same period of 1995 to $230 from $225 principally due to increased costs at Casa Berardi and Mineral Hill which were partially offset by improvements at La Coipa.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>OPERATIONS REVIEW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>LA COIPA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold equivalent production from the La Coipa mine in the first quarter of 1996 was 59,200 ounces (43,400 ounces of gold and 1,131,500 ounces of silver) which compares to 45,700 ounces (28,800 ounces of gold and 1,359,000 ounces of silver) in the  corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs on a gold equivalent ounce basis for the period decreased to $159 from $188 the previous year. The decrease in cash costs and increase in production are primarily due to higher grades of gold in the ore being mined and achieving higher plant recoveries.

<P><B>CRIXÁS</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Crixás mine was 15,400 ounces in the first quarter of 1996 compared to 15,600 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period.  Cash costs for the period were $186 compared to $191 in the same period of 1995.

<P><B>BRASÍLIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Brasília mine was 12,800 ounces in the first quarter compared to 13,400 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs for the period were $232 compared to $238 in the previous year. During the quarter, the Company and its joint venture partners approved plans for a two year expansion program of the current operation designed to increase annual production to 210,000 ounces of gold by the year 1999. On February 1, the new 85 tonne fleet of trucks was commissioned, and the mining contractor replaced. 

<P><B>MINERAL HILL</B>

<P>The Company's share of gold production from the Mineral Hill mine was 8,200 ounces in the first quarter compared to 8,800 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. This decrease in production was a result of milling lower grade ore and reduced tonnage. Cash costs for the period were $422 compared to $370 in the previous year. Ore was intersected on the Ski Slope decline indicating that access to the main Ski Slope ore reserve block will occur by the end of the second quarter. The development of the Crevice tunnel is progressing and at March 31, 1996, 1.9 kilometres of the total planned tunnel length of approximately 4 kilometres was completed.

<P><B>CASA BERARDI</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the Casa Berardi mine was 12,700 ounces in the first quarter compared to 9,500 ounces in the corresponding 1995 period. Cash costs per ounce for the first quarter were $370 compared to the previous year when cash costs were $277 per ounce. Quarter over quarter, cash costs are expected to continue to decline.  The increase in production reflects the ongoing production improvements being achieved at the mine compared to the prior year.  Production was 1% below plan while total development realized was 7% below plan, principally due to low production in January. Total backfill achieved was 20% above plan allowing the mines to catch up on their backlog. The Deep Development program is nearing completion with approximately 350 metres of development needed to join the Est and Ouest mines through the Principale Zone. The Principale Zone has been intersected by an access drift. A legal strike commenced April 19 after unionized workers rejected the final offer by the Company. During the strike, the mine was under the care and maintenance of senior staff.  On May 27, with the assistance of a mutually agreed conciliator, management and the Casa Berardi Syndicat des Metallos d'Amerique Union members agreed to a 3 year contract, effective retroactively from March 7, 1996.  The overall cost of the contract averages 4.5% per year. 

<P><B>NEW BRITANNIA</B>

<P>The Company's share of production from the New Britannia mine was 9,000 ounces for the first quarter of 1996. The initial ore mined from the satellite No. 3 Zone was milled in its entirety by March 31. Main mine tonnage scale up was adversely affected by lower grades at the Toots Zone and slower than planned main mine development. To supplement feed while ongoing development is being performed at the main mine, a 25,000 tonne test pit is being implemented at the Birch Zone. By the end of the second quarter, it is anticipated that four long-hole stopes will be available for mining from the main mine and tonnages should approach 1,400 tpd. The revised projected production for 1996 is estimated at 75,000 ounces, 25% below the planned 100,000 ounce annual production.

<P><B>KASSANDRA MINES</B>

<P>The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, TVX Hellas A.E., 100% owner of the Kassandra Mines, encountered delays at the Olympias mine as local protestors restricted the passage of equipment and materials to the site.  At the Stratoni mill, base metal operations resumed.  TVX Hellas completed the basic refurbishment of the Stratoni mill over the ten weeks prior to its being put into production.  The refurbishment included upgrading the facility, modernizing and enhancing existing flotation cells, updating certain machinery and replacing reagent lines.  The Stratoni mill plans to produce a lead-zinc concentrate at a rate of 700 tpd with mill feed from the nearby Madem Lakkos underground mine where mining has recommenced.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B>MUSSELWHITE</B>

<P>The Company and its joint venture partner, Placer Dome Canada Limited, the operator of the project, made a decision in February to construct a gold mine at the Musselwhite property in northwestern Ontario at a capital cost of $190 million. Development of a mine and construction of processing facilities started immediately in order to commence production in the second quarter of 1997.  Reserves are estimated to be 2,100,000 ounces of gold for an estimated mine life of ten years at a projected production rate of approximately 200,000 ounces of gold annually. The mill will be designed for a production rate of 3,300 tonnes per day (1,204,500 tonnes per year). Processing facilities will employ conventional gravity separation, cyanide leach and carbon-in-pulp (CIP) processes. The ore is free milling, providing gold recoveries of approximately 95%. Cash production costs are estimated at $200 per ounce.

<P><B>KASPERSKE HORY</B>

<P>During the first quarter of 1996, exploration work at TVX Gold's Kasperske Hory project was directed largely towards following up surface diamond drilling results from 1995's successful exploration program. Within the Golden Creek Deposit, 4,600 metres of underground drilling and 313 metres of underground development were completed.  The majority of the drill holes intersected their targets as planned, confirming the initial interpretation of the mineralization. During the remainder of 1996, additional diamond drilling and underground development is planned in an attempt to further define the known mineralization and increase the reserve base.

<P><B>PACHICUTZA</B>

<P>At the Company's Pachicutza project in Ecuador, an adit is being driven into the deposit to permit development and further exploration. The 1996 development program calls for 6,000 metres of drilling, 600 metres of tunnelling and 180 metres of underground drifting along high grade structures. This work is being conducted in anticipation of an operation producing approximately 58,000 ounces of gold equivalent annually, with a by-product zinc-lead concentrate, for an estimated mine life of six years.

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>Cash flow from operations increased to $16.5 million in the first quarter of 1996, from $2.2 million in the comparable 1995 period, as a result of the improvements in working capital due to reduced funding of the joint venture partner for New Britannia and proceeds received from the settlement of the Casa Berardi insurance claim. Major expenditures in 1996 include the expansion of the Brasília mine, the development of the Kassandra Mines and the Musselwhite project . As well, the Company purchased the commitment to issue 400,000 shares to Royalstar Resources for Cdn $2 million.

<P>During the first quarter of 1996, the Company realized $26.4 million from the sale of equity investments which included $14.3 million on the disposition of the Gold Reserve shares and warrants received as part of the settlement of the Brisas property dispute in Venezuela.

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>PRIVATE PLACEMENT</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In January 1996, TVX Gold completed a private placement in the United States of $150 million Unsecured Senior Notes bearing interest at 7.51% and due January 15, 2001.  The Notes were sold to several U.S. life insurance companies.  Approximately $20,000,000 of the proceeds were used to repay drawings on operating bank lines.  The balance is available for anticipated capital expenditures, for the acquisition, exploration and development of mining prospects and for general corporate purposes.

<HR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1><B>MANAGEMENT</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In May, the Company announced the strengthening of its Senior Operating Management Team with the appointments of Mr. David Murray as President and Chief Operating Officer and Mr. Clifford J. Davis as Senior Vice President, North American Operations.  The Company also anticipates the announcement of a third member of this Senior Operating Management Team as Senior Vice President, European Operations.  The Company also announced that Mr. John Hick will now serve in the capacity of Vice Chairman of the Corporation.
