<P>Dear Friend:<BR>

<P>Currently in America, hundreds of families are home schooling children with special needs ranging from attention deficit disorder to severe multiple handicaps.  Parents often find that when they bring these children home to be educated, they come out of the &quot;deep freeze&quot; that has kept them from making significant progress.  Gone are the comparisons, labels, social pressures, and distractions that a regular classroom can bring.  Parents can offer their children individualized education, flexibility, encouragement, and support.  For learning disabled children who function best with &quot;real-life problems&quot; rather than artificial worksheet tasks, home schooling is ideal.  For medically sensitive children, learning at home provides the opportunity for careful monitoring.  And for attention deficit children who function best with less structured time and fewer distractions, home schooling is the answer.<BR>

<P>The decision to home school a child with special learning needs is a weighty one.  Parents may meet pressure from the school district, or even the state, to enroll their child in the system.  Many encounter criticism from well-meaning family and friends, and most must deal with their own fears of inadequacy.  Nevertheless, in record numbers, parents of special needs children are choosing to home educate, and most are finding that the rewards far outweigh the costs.<BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) exists to defend the right of all families to home school.  This includes families who are home schooling a special needs child.  HSLDA will provide the aid of an attorney should your home school encounter any legal problems.  Additionally, HSLDA can supply you with a list of professionals who are qualified to assist you in testing and setting up a plan for teaching your child.  We also offer a list of resources for interested parents who need help in selecting their curriculum.<BR>

<P>Of course, you will have to decide whether home schooling is best for you, your child, and the rest of your family.  HSLDA is here to assist and encourage you.  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.<BR>

<P>Sincerely,<BR>

<P>Janet Wayne<BR>
HSLDA Special Needs Coordinator<BR>

<P><B>Two Steps You Can Take to Protect Your Special Needs Home School</B><BR>

<P>HSLDA is convinced that home schooling is the best way to meet most special learning needs, and we are delighted to assist dedicated parents in this endeavor.  Our experience in defending home schoolers and in monitoring legislation causes us to believe that the battlefront for home schooling children with special learning needs is rapidly heating up. There are two steps that we recommend our members take to help us defend their home schools.  You may also find it beneficial to take these steps.  As you read through these suggestions, remember that it is best to choose a course of action that fits the severity of your child's special learning needs.<BR>

<P>1. Arrange for regular evaluations and document your child's progress.  <BR>

<P>Whatever the severity of your child's special learning needs, it is important to keep accurate<BR>
records demonstrating how you met these needs and how your child has progressed.  Much of your success in defending your home school against any legal challenges may hinge upon your personal determination of what is best for your child and upon your keeping of accurate records.  <BR>

<P>One of the most important elements of your record keeping should be documentation of periodic evaluations of educational progress.  HSLDA recommends that all families with children who have special learning needs perform such evaluations.  As a general guide, the more severe the special learning need, the more frequent and thorough the evaluations should be.<BR>

<P>There are several options for performing evaluations.  Form C - a sample evaluation form to help you picture the kind of information that would be valuable to document.  (This form is available by calling HSLDA and will be downloadable in the future).  It is best to keep all of your records concerning each special needs child for a minimum of three years or until the child is beyond compulsory school age.  <BR>

<P>2. Obtain assistance in meeting your child's special needs. <BR>

<P>If any of the following are true of your child, we suggest that you obtain some form of assistance.  <BR>

<P>Your child:<BR>
a) has received special education services in this current school year,<BR>
b) has been enrolled in special education services for the coming school year, <BR>
c) has been evaluated and diagnosed as having a special learning need, <BR>
d) is functioning substantially below grade level, <BR>
e) has a physical disability that significantly hinders his or her ability to learn, or <BR>
f) has severe educational difficulties that have been observed but not professionally diagnosed.<BR>

<P>If, after reading this list, you determine that you do need assistance, you will next need to determine what kind of assistance to obtain.  As parents, you are intimately acquainted with your child's needs and are best able to determine what specific help will be most beneficial.  In general, the more severe your child's special learning needs, the more assistance you should obtain to help meet these needs.  We have provided the following options for your consideration.<BR>

<P>A. EDUCATIONAL CONSULTANTS.  Because of the legal complexities involved in dealing with schools and government agencies, one of the safest things you can do to protect your home school is to obtain the services of a special needs educational consultant.  This consultant would be someone who could, in the event you were called upon to defend your home school, serve as an objective expert witness in defense of your home-schooling program.<BR>

<P>This consultant can be anyone who has either credentials or experience in the same area as your child's special need.  Preferably, this person should not be directly related to the child (i.e. parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, etc.).  The consultant should be in contact with your family a minimum of four times during the school year to document your child's progress. <BR>

<P>To find a consultant, there are several different sources you can contact:<BR>

<P>FRIENDS.  It is best to first contact personal friends who might themselves be able to assist you or who might know of someone who can.   <BR>
SUPPORT GROUPS.  Contact your local or state support group for the names of individuals who work with families with special needs children. <BR>
SPECIALISTS.  Families who have children with special needs have often used the services of a number of specialists.  You may want to contact the same individuals who provide their services to public schools; some will also provide their services privately.  <BR>
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.  Some colleges and universities have programs available to help families with special needs children.  Please be aware, however, that they commonly will want your permission to use the results of their work with your child in research-related projects.<BR>

<P>B. PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. The next most beneficial thing you can do to protect your home school is to secure regularly scheduled assistance and/or evaluation for your child through a private program (e.g. Hewitt Research or the National Association for Child Development) that provides services to children who have the same area of special need as your child. <BR>

<P>C. PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAMS.   In general, we have found that it is better if families do not use the services offered through their local public school.  We have seen many families end up with legal difficulties because of their involvement with the public school.<BR>

<P>If your family is currently receiving public special education services, you may want to establish a goal to eventually meet all of your child's special education needs through private sources.  We are aware that many families have previously enrolled their child in their local public school's special education program and, now that they are home schooling, they would like to retain these free public services.  We understand that as a matter of economics and ease of access, free public school services are very attractive.  We also understand, however, that strings of regulation come attached to these programs.  Generally, we find that the longer a family uses these programs, the tighter the strings of control become.<BR>
  <BR>
D. OTHER.  Of course, there are other steps you can take that may involve combinations of these suggestions or yet other alternatives. <BR>

<P>HSLDA will do everything we can to protect a family's right to home school a child who has<BR>
special learning needs.  Members of Home School Legal Defense Association are welcome to call our Special Needs Coordinator, Janet Wayne, for assistance with any of the above-described steps, including finding a consultant and giving advice to families who want to withdraw their child from receiving public school services.<BR>

<P>The information provided is designed to assist families in establishing the safest legal environment possible for their home schools.  These recommendations do not constitute legal advice.  <BR>

<P>The forms found on the following page are samples.  HSLDA members who indicate on their<BR>
application or renewal form that they are home schooling a special needs child will be sent<BR>
HSLDA's &quot;Recommendations for Home Schooling Children with Special Needs,&quot; which includes these forms along with instructions for filling them out.  (Sample forms and instructions are available by calling HSLDA and will be downloadable in the future). <BR>

<P>For further information and guidance, read through the questions and answers.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>Questions and Answers for Parents of Special Needs Children</B><BR>

<P>What does Home School Legal Defense Association consider a special need?<BR>

<P>Generally, we define a special needs child as one who is working two or more years behind grade level in the majority of his subjects, a child who has been receiving special education services, or a child with any other disability that seriously affects his/her ability to learn.  <BR>

<P>Do I have the right to home school my special needs child?<BR>
 <BR>
Parents who wish to home school a special needs child have the right to do so under the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.  This includes parents who presently have their child in an Individual Educational Plan (IEP) set up by their public school's special education department.  <BR>

<P>Parents may feel intimidated by school officials and teachers and are often led to believe that they have fewer constitutional rights to home school a special needs child than a normal child.  <BR>

<P>Even though the Constitution protects the right of parents to home school, most state legislatures have passed statutes regarding home schooling. These laws typically come under the compulsory school attendance statutes for the state, and often contain stricter provisions for families home schooling special needs children. For example, in Iowa, the family of a special needs child must get prior approval from the Area Education Agency (AEA).  In Arkansas, children who have been identified as needing special education services must receive these services from a state-certified special education teacher.<BR>
 <BR>
Do I have a right to therapeutic services offered through the public school? <BR>

<P>It depends on the state you live in, your family's financial need, and the severity of your child's need.  Please be aware, however, that HSLDA discourages families from pursuing services through the public schools.  Instead, we recommend obtaining services provided by private organizations or individuals.  Please note that HSLDA does not assist members in obtaining public school services.     <BR>

<P>What if our family cannot afford to have related services done privately?<BR>

<P>Call us.  The most important consideration is that the special needs of your child are being met. <BR>
HSLDA members who cannot afford private services are encouraged to contact our Special Needs Coordinator for assistance and counsel.<BR>

<P>Does HSLDA require families to use a consultant?<BR>

<P>No.  However, HSLDA does recommend at least quarterly contact with a consultant if the child's needs are severe enough to warrant assistance.<BR>

<P>How long should families retain the assistance of a consultant or educational program?<BR>

<P>It depends.  In general, if the special learning need is remediable through home schooling, you should maintain this assistance until your child is functioning close to grade level.  If the special learning need is such that it cannot be corrected, you should probably continue to receive assistance throughout your home-schooling experience or until your child is no longer of compulsory school age.  The answer to this question may also vary depending upon the specific statutes and regulations in your particular state.<BR>

<P>Must my consultant be currently certified?<BR>

<P>No.  Parents should not be concerned about whether the consultant is currently certified or certified in their state only that they have credentials and/or experience in the area of their child's special need.  <BR>

<P>What if my consultant is making too little or too many recommendations for me to follow?<BR>

<P>It is important to communicate your expectations to your consultant at your initial meeting.  If you are a beginning home schooler, you might want a significant amount of oversight and recommendations from your consultant. If you are an experienced home schooler, however, you might want a consultant who has a hands-off philosophy.  If you find that you are not compatible with the consultant you have chosen, you can locate someone else.  <BR>

<P>Can I obtain the services of a consultant from another state? <BR>

<P>Yes. However, it is best to have a consultant who has met you and your child and is able to meet with you in person. If you choose a person in another state, consider sending samples of your child's work to them and then consulting with them over the phone.  <BR>

<P>What kind of quarterly evaluations are necessary?<BR>

<P>We do not specify what the evaluation should involve but only that there is a review of the child's progress. The most important component of the evaluation is that the parent and consultant are aware of the special needs child's skill levels and how he is progressing with them.  There are many ways to do this other than administering a standardized test.  For instance, if you have written down some domestic goals for your child, such as putting away clean clothes, have a checklist to evaluate whether he is doing this independently.  If he is not, make notes of what he is unable to accomplish and what steps he is failing to understand.  You can share this information with your consultant when you meet quarterly.  The two of you can brainstorm ways to facilitate his progress through these steps.    <BR>

<P>Should I send the evaluations to HSLDA?<BR>

<P>No. Just keep copies in your files at home.  If your home school is ever in jeopardy, we will request these records from you.<BR>

<P>Are evaluations required by the state?<BR>

<P>No. HSLDA requests evaluations for the benefit of the family should they encounter any legal problems as a result of home schooling their special needs child. <BR>

<P>PLEASE REMEMBER: Each state has its own requirements that are separate from these recommendations.<BR>

<P>Am I legally required to have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for home schooling? <BR>

<P>The public school system uses IEPs to set up individual teaching plans, obtain related therapeutic services, and make transportation arrangements if necessary.  Home schooling is a different educational arena. Children no longer have to be transported to class, therapeutic services are done privately, and home schooling offers individualized education for all students not just special needs children.   <BR>

<P>We suggest that parents exercise responsible home schooling by planning and evaluating each child's progress.  For clarification purposes we designate IEPs for home educators as Student Education Plans (SEPs).     <BR>

<P>In addition to legal representation, what services does HSLDA provide for member families who have children with special needs?<BR>

<P>HSLDA provides:<BR>
<ul><li>A list of professionals in the member family's area who have experience and credentials in the area of special needs.  </li><BR>
<li>Available resource guides in the area of your child's special needs.</li><BR>
<li>The Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised, an untimed, individually administered test used for children who do not test well in a lengthy, timed group test with other children.  It must be administered by a special education teacher.</li><BR>
<li>The Brigance Inventory of Basic Skills, a test that helps parents inventory their child's skills.  The purpose of the test is to help parents determine what skills their child has and has not mastered. </li><BR>
<li>The Brigance Inventory of Early Development is for parents of developmentally delayed children from birth to eight years to assess eleven major skill areas.</li><BR>
<li>A special needs coordinator is available should any questions arise concerning home schooling your special needs child.</li></ul><BR>
