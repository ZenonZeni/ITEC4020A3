<H2> Wallace Vows to Build Mazda, Maintain Identity </H2>

<EM> Reported on RX-7 mail list May 10, 1996 </EM>

<P> TOKYO (Reuter) - Henry Wallace, who will become the first
foreigner to head a major Japanese corporation, vowed Thursday
to turn around troubled Mazda Motor Corp. while keeping it
independent of its American big brother, Ford Motor Co.

<P> The Ford executive, who will takeover as Mazda's president
next month, said Ford was not aiming to swallow up the Japanese
firm and wanted to maintain Mazda's separate identity. The two
firms have a long-standing relationship.

<P> ``It is not a strategy (to let Mazda disappear). It is a
strategy to build Mazda,'' Wallace, who was brought in by Ford
two years ago to help run financially troubled Mazda, told a
news conference.

<P> Hiroshima-based Mazda has been struggling to overcome slow exports
due to the strong yen and poor domestic sales. Ford announced last month
that it would increase its equity investment in Mazda in a deal under
which Wallace, currently executive vice president at Mazda, will take
the helm of Japan's fifth largest carmaker in June.  The equity deal
gave Mazda a 52.31 billion yen ($498 million) capital infusion and
raised Ford's stake to one-third from one-quarter.  Mazda has forecast
nil net profit for the year that ended March 31 after reporting parent
net losses of almost 80 billion yen ($761 million) in the two years
before that.

<P> Wallace said earnings details and the forecast for the current year
would be released next week, when the company issues its financial
statement.  He said Mazda was making progress toward profitability by
cost-cutting and restructuring, but that it still had a long way to go
before achieving its profit goals.  "I think we are making progress,"
he said, but added: "We are at a threshold ... We have a long time to
go before we would be at a (profit) level I would be comfortable with."

<P> Wallace said both Mazda and Ford could benefit from various
synergies, such as in sales and distribution or in eliminating
duplication.  ``But frankly, we haven't sat down with Ford to talk with
them,'' he added.  He said there would be a quarterly meeting at the end
of this month, but added that he did not expect any major decisions on
the synergies.

<P> Wallace said Mazda would focus on building up its Japanese business
and put more of an emphasis on production overseas.  The company also
would continue to strengthen its business in North America, Europe, Asia
and Latin America.
