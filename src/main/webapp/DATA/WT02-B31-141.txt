<STRONG>Take a Closer Look</STRONG><BR>
Achieving your personal and financial goals didn't happen overnight. It took hard
work and dedication.
Protecting those years of hard work is a right you have earned and deserve. Proper
estate planning can
help accomplish this goal.  <P>
A properly structured estate plan builds security for you and your family today and
assures that your
estate will be transferred according to your wishes after you are gone.
Unfortunately, many individuals
are unaware that over half the value of their estate could be lost to federal
estate taxes at death. In other
words, without proper planning, the IRS could be the single largest beneficiary of
your estate. 
<P>

<STRONG>What is Your Estate Worth? </STRONG><BR>
Do you need to worry about estate taxes? It depends upon your estate's value. The table
below lists some of the assets used to determine your estate tax exposure. If married, remember
 to include the assets that you and your spouse jointly own.<P>
Keep in mind that the estate tax bill is due within nine months after your death.
This time constraint
could force your heirs to sell valuable assets, often at a discount, to raise the
cash needed to pay estate
taxes. So in a short period of time, a large percentage of your estate could
disappear.

<STRONG>How Do You Pay Estate Taxes?</STRONG><BR>
Now that you know the importance of properly structuring an estate plan, let's take
a look at four funding
methods.<P>
<STRONG>Cash</STRONG> - With this method, your heirs may be forced to sell stocks,
bonds, and
other investments to pay
the estate tax bill. However, selling in a down market could result in substantial
economic loss. Estate
assets will be depleted and future investment opportunities foregone.<P>
<STRONG>Credit</STRONG> - In some instances, your beneficiaries will need to obtain
a bank loan to
pay estate taxes.
Unfortunately, this is only a short-term remedy. Eventually, your heirs must repay
the loan plus
interest.<P>
<STRONG>Sale of Illiquid Assets</STRONG> - In some instances, your heirs will need
to sell any
business interest, personal
residence, or other real estate possessions to raise the funds to pay the estate
tax bill. The sale of a
business could leave your heirs without a potential source of livelihood.<P>
<STRONG>Life Insurance</STRONG> - Purchasing life insurance can be a cost-effective
funding
vehicle for an estate plan.
Your heirs may use the life insurance proceeds to pay the estate tax bill, without
depleting the estate's
assets. Life insurance proceeds can also be received free from federal income tax
and estate tax if the
estate plan is properly structured.
<P>
<STRONG>Survivorship Whole Life:  A Solution To Your Estate Needs</STRONG><BR>
Survivorship Whole Life insurance from New York Life uses today's dollars to make
sure your estate has the liquidity needed to pay estate taxes tomorrow. 
Survivorship Whole Life insures <EM>two</EM> individuals in <EM>one</EM> insurance
plan and pays the death benefit after the death of the <EM>second</EM> insured.  As
a result, the cost is more affordable than purchasing two separate life insurance
policies.
<P>
<STRONG>A Valuable Addition To Your Portfolio</STRONG><BR>
Survivorship Whole Life offers much more than a funding vehicle for an estate plan. 
It can help meet your business continuation, wealth replacement, charitable giving,
estate creation and dependent care needs-- whichever is more important to you.  In
this respect, Survivorship Whole Life is not just for older, affluent couples with
estate tax problems.  Survivorship Whole Life can also be a valuable addition to
younger couples' or business owners' portfolios.
<P>
Will your child or grandchild be protected if you and your spouse should die
unexpectedly?  Would you like to leave an asset or a business to one child, but
wonder how to provide equally to other children?  Will your business survive
without you or your partner?  Survivorship Whole Life can solve these and other
financial concerns.
<P>
<STRONG>Why Choose New York Life?</STRONG><BR>
At New York Life, we realize that no two individuals are alike.  For this reason,
our Survivorship Whole Life offers the flexibility to choose a method of payment
that best fits your situation.
<P>
In our Level Premium plan, the base premium remains fixed throughout the insureds'
lifetimes.  If rising costs and increased premiums down the road are a concern,
this option provides you with the security that comes from knowing your base
premium will <EM>never</EM> increase.
<P>
The Modified Premium plan has a fixed premium for the first <EM>fifteen</EM> years
of your policy.  In year sixteen, the base premium doubles and remains fixed
throughout the life of your policy.  This plan effectively minimizes current
premiums and allows you to prepare properly for future premium payments-- an
attractive feature particularly for younger policyowners.
<P>
We also offer a number of affordable riders that allow you to further tailor the
Survivorship Whole Life policy to meet your specific needs and objectives.  For
extra protection, term insurance may be available to increase your coverage at a
competitve cost.  Or, if you or your spouse or business partner will need cash when
one of you dies, riders that pay a death benefit after the <EM>first</EM> death may
be available.  Your New York Life agent will help you design a plan that meets your
specific needs.
