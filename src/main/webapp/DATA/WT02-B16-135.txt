concept of green power and the context in which green power fits into the electric power 
industry marketplace.</em></font>

<p><strong>Background on Green Power Marketing</strong>

<p>The passage of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978 expanded the 
market for larger, bulk-power-oriented renewable electric projects.  This legislation 
partially addressed the restrictive market power of utilities by requiring utilities to 
interconnect with and purchase power from certain qualifying facilities (QFs) at a 
utility’s avoided cost, or the cost that the utility would have incurred by generating or 
otherwise supplying the power itself.

<p>In the early days of PURPA implementation, electricity costs were rising and electricity 
demand growth was higher than it is today, which led to favorably proced, long-term 
avoided cost contracts for renewables developers.  More recently, low natural gas prices 
and the increased competition in the wholesale electricity markets initiated by PURPA have 
lowered generation proces and caused utilities and regulators alike to adopt a vert 
short-term perspective of the electricity market.  In this environment, renewables, with 
their higher front-end investment requirements and longer-term contractual needs, are at a 
disadvantage.  Indeed, annual renewables electric capacity additions have fallen to 
between 200 MW and 300 MW during the 1990’s from a level of more than 1,000 MW during the 
late 1980’s.

<p>Currently, electric utilities are facing increasing competition because of a nationwide 
movement to deregulate the power-supply industry.  The promotion of greater competition 
in electricity markets is premised on the belief that a more competitive market will 
result in lower market prices than the traditional regulated monopoly industry structure.  
This will be achieved by giving a greater number of suppliers access to the market.  
Renewables, with higher-front end costs, will be disadvantaged in this strictly 
price-based segment of the market.  

<p>However, full competition should also provide electricity customers with a greater choice 
of how their electricity is produced, and this opens a new market for renewables.  In the 
face of this competition, utilities have a growing impetus to strengthen their image with 
their customers and build customer loyalty.  Two important factors in customer loyalty 
are:

<p>1) Most utility customers want their utilities to pursue environmentally benign options for 
generating power.  

<p>2) Some utility customers are willing to pay extra to receive (or even just to fund) power 
generated from renewable sources.

<p>Some utilities are now offering customers the option of paying more to receive such 
environmentally-preferable power a concept known as "green pricing."  Green pricing is an 
evolving utility service that responds to utility customers' preferences for electricity 
derived from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or biomass.  Under green 
pricing, utilities offer customers a voluntary program or service to support electricity 
generated from renewable energy systems. Customers are asked to pay a rate premium, which 
is meant to cover the costs that the utility incurs above those paid for electricity from 
conventional fuels. Utilities are considering green pricing as a way to build customer 
loyalty, deploy popular renewable technologies, expand business lines and expertise, and 
improve understanding of customer response to unbundled pricing and services.

<p>The more general concept of marketing green power is usually referred to as "green power 
marketing." Green power marketing capitalizes on an expressed public preference for 
cleaner energy options, such as renewables, by giving consumers a market option to 
purchase renewables-based electricity services.  Green marketing has the potential to 
expand domestic markets for renewable energy technologies by fostering greater 
availability of renewable electric service options in retail markets and is compatible 
with ongoing attempts to introduce greater competition into the generation and delivery of 
electricity.
