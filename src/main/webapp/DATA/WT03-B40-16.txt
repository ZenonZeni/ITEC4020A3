FUNDING CHANGES EXPECTED AT PEW AFTER REORGANIZATION

     The Pew Charitable Trusts, Philadelphia, PA, recently
concluded a major organizational restructuring in an effort to
respond to increases in the foundation's assets and grant making
that occurred during the 1980s.  In 1990, with assets that now
exceed $3.2 billion, the foundation expects to make grants
totaling roughly $145 million.  Along with the expanded grant
making will come a program that emphasizes increased foundation
involvement with grantees as well as with other grant makers and
a stronger commitment to interdisciplinary funding.  Here is a
program-by-program look at some of the changes at the foundation.
     Health and human services.  According to Drew E. Altman, who
now heads Pew's health and human services program, "A natural
role for foundations is to provide the seed funds for [health and
human services] programs that ultimately get picked up and
integrated into government funding streams."  In addition to a
closer collaboration with the government, Altman predicts more
partnerships with other foundations.  While Altman says he
expects the process of developing a new agenda for the foundation
to take several years, he is certain that the problems of
children living in poverty will be "a top concern."
     Education.  Pew's new program director for education, Robert
B. Schwartz, believes there is potential for increased
partnerships between the government, the corporate sector, and
foundations in education, with foundations providing the "initial
risk capital to test innovative programs."  While higher
education will continue to be a primary focus of the trusts,
Schwartz expects to direct increased attention toward
intervention programs that will focus on the middle-school years.
     According to Schwartz, the foundation will encourage
educators who are taking a broader view of their role, one which
cuts across traditional service lines and includes
responsibilities such as nutrition and health care.  Schwartz is
also interested in exploring the role of private philanthropy in
encouraging a more centralized national educational agenda.
     Culture.  Marian A Godfrey, the foundation's new program
director for culture, says she "would like to explore
partnerships at the local and national levels" with corporations,
the government, and other foundations.  Godfrey predicts that a
number of existing priorities are likely to receive greater
attention, such as support for individual artists and
multi-cultural programing.  Pew is also looking into
opportunities for funding programs to increase public
appreciation of the arts and culture.
     Religion.  Joel A. Carpenter, the new program director for
religion, believes the importance of religious scholarship has
been underestimated by American academics.  "An anthropologist
going to New Guinea would never think of trying to understand
that culture without also studying its religion," explains
Carpenter, "but somehow American scholars have gotten into the
frame of mind that they can understand Western culture without
this critical component."  In addition to providing continued
support for religious scholarship, Carpenter says Pew will also
expand its support of church-based community service.  As a
beginning, Carpenter says Pew recently initiated a national small
grants program through World Vision that will support local
religious programs in housing, leadership development, and job
training.
     The environment.  The foundation recently hired Joshua S.
Reichert as its new program director for conservation and the
environment.  According to Reichert, the trusts look forward to,
and expect to encourage, a "groundswell of community-based
activism" on behalf of the environment.  Reichert says he will be
considering a wide range of opportunities to promote
environmentally sustainable economic development, strengthen
grass-roots environmental organizations, increase public
awareness, and encourage new public policy ideas for addressing
important environmental problems.
     Public policy.  Kevin F.F. Quigley is the trusts' new
program director for public policy.  While Quigley says the
program's basic priorities will remain the same, he adds that
some areas will receive greater emphasis in the coming years.  "I
will be exploring ways to build on our existing Economics and
National Security program to further strengthen the integration
of the two fields at the policy level," says Quigley.  "Also,
given the trusts' historic interests in supporting free markets
and democracy, we will be taking a closer look at how Pew might
more actively promote these values around the world, beginning in
Eastern Europe."
     In 1989, the Pew Charitable Trusts made grants totaling
roughly $146.7 million.  Of this amount, 46% went to health and
human services, 24% went to education, 14% went to culture, 8%
went to religion, 5% went to conservation and the environment,
and 4% went to public policy.  For more information about the
trusts, contact Deidra A. Lyngard, Communications Manager, Pew
Charitable Trusts, Three Parkway, Suite 501, Philadelphia, PA

WOODRUFF FOUNDATION JOINS TOP 20 U.S. FOUNDATIONS

     The Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, Atlanta, GA, has seen its
assets and giving levels skyrocket during the past year as it
continues to receive assets from the estate of Robert W.
Woodruff.
     At the end of 1987, the foundation had assets of $66.2
million.  By 1988, that figure had more than tripled, with
year-end assets of $194.5 million, and by 1989, assets had
reached $755.7 million.  The foundation estimates assets in the
area of $890 million by the end of this year, which puts it among
the top 20 U.S. foundations in terms of assets.
     Meanwhile, giving levels have bounded from almost $3 million
(1987), to $3.9 million (1988), up to $8.7 million (1989).
Projected total grants for 1990 reflect the foundation's new
wealth, with a contributions figure in the area of $25 million.
Background.  The foundation was established in 1937 by the late
Robert W. Woodruff.  Woodruff became president of the Coca-Cola
Company in the 1920s, and was instrumental in building the soft
drink company into an international business.  He had no children
and left most of his estate to the foundation when he died in
1985.
     The Woodruff Foundation's major priorities are education,
health care, the arts, social services, and the environment.
Most grant recipients are Georgia-based organizations such as
colleges and universities (Emory University has been a major
beneficiary), hospitals, and arts centers.  The foundation also
makes grants to out-of-state organizations for the benefit of
Georgia residents.  For example, the foundation has provided
funds for scholarship programs for students from Georgia.
     In 1988, the foundation gave 41% of total funding to the
arts, 27% to health organizations, 17% to civic groups, 12% to
educational institutions, and 3% to social service organizations.
     Contact Charles H. McTier, President, Robert W. Woodruff
Foundation, 230 Peachtree Street N.W., Suite 1400, Atlanta, GA
30303, (404) 522-6755.

     A U.S. district court has determined that the IRS properly

     A U.S. district court has determined that the IRS properly
imposed a $64,000 excise tax on the Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation for failure to file annual reports on the progress of
a program-related investment (PRI).  In Charles Stewart Mott
Foundation v. U.S., the court found that the regulation requiring
annual reports on PRI grants was ambiguous.  However, the court
agreed with the IRS that requiring annual reports for the entire
life of the grant was more consistent with the overall regulatory
scheme.  The case concerned a $320,000 PRI grant made by Mott to
a community organization in 1976.  After filing annual reports on
the grant for the years 1976 to 1980, the foundation discontinued
its reports, believing that Treasury regulations required reports
for only the first three years of PRI grants.  In its decision,
the court noted that PRI grantees are required to report to the
grantor throughout the life of the PRI, making it consistent to
require that the grantor report to the IRS during the same
period.

     The Fred Meyer Charitable Trust, Portland, OR, has changed
its name, effective April 23 of this year, to Meyer Memorial
Trust.  According to the foundation, the name change results from
the foundation's desire to make it clear that the trust is a
private foundation, "not a company foundation related in any way
to Fred Meyer, Inc."  When Fred Meyer died in 1978, he left the
bulk of his estate to the trust, which provides funding for
social welfare, arts and humanities, education, and health
organizations.  The Meyer Memorial Trust has never owned stock in
or received any contributions from the company.  The street
address and telephone number for the trust have not changed: 1515
S.W. Fifth Avenue, Suite 500, Portland, OR 97201, (503) 228-5512.

     The Annie E. Casey Foundation, Greenwich, CT, has announced
a 50% increase in grants to aid disadvantaged children.  The
foundation, which accepts funding proposals only from preselected
organizations, will achieve the increase by allocating the
interest on its capital to grants rather than to its endowment.
As a result, funding for programs will increase from about $30
million next year to $45 million in 1993.  According to the
foundation, the extra funds will be used to increase support for
successful grassroots programs which are having difficulty with
fund raising.  Contact the foundation at 31 Brookside Drive,
Greenwich, CT 06830, (203) 661-2773.

GANNETT FOUNDATION TO SELL COMPANY STOCK

     Only a few months after a highly publicized headquarters
move to Arlington, VA, the Gannett Foundation is attracting
attention again with the announcement of plans to sell its
Gannett Company stock.  The foundation, headed by former Gannett
Company chairman Allen H. Neuharth, announced on April 25 that
its trustees had voted unanimously to retain an investment
banking firm to negotiate a possible sale of its 10% block of stock.
     The Gannett Foundation, which ranks in the top 20 U.S.
foundations in terms of assets, is currently the biggest Gannet
Company shareholder.  The Gannett stock represents the
foundation's only asset.
     According to a statement from foundation chairman Neuharth
and president Charles L. Overby, the foundation's decision to
sell its Gannett Company stock was motivated by IRS regulations
requiring foundations to pay out 5% of their assets each year.
The Gannett stock's annual dividend is $1.20 a share, which comes
to an annual yield of roughly 3.3%.
     At current market rates, the Gannett Foundation's 15,940,185
shares are worth between $550 million and $600 million.  Neuharth
and Overby said in their joint statement that "we will expand the
work of the USA's largest information-based foundation,
especially broadening programs in education, literacy, and First
Amendment freedoms."
     The foundation spent about $30 million on grants, programs,
and operations in 1989.  Areas of giving included journalism
(education, minority advancement, and professionalism); adult
literacy; special grants; local and community grants (for a
variety of nonprofits located in areas served by Gannett media);
philanthropy and volunteerism; and disaster relief.
     For further information, contact Tracy Quinn, Vice President
of Communications, Gannett Foundation, 1101 Wilson Boulevard,
Arlington, VA 22209, (703) 284-2800.

FORD FOUNDATION EXPANDS GRANT MAKING

     The Ford Foundation's two-year budget for 1990-91 calls for
a 13.2% increase in grant making compared to 1988-89, according
to the foundation.  Most giving programs, including urban
poverty, human rights and social justice, governance and public
policy, education and culture, and international affairs, will
increase grant making significantly.
     In addition, the foundation has sharply increased funding
for program-related investments (low-interest loans to
nonprofits) and for its general reserve fund, which the
foundation uses to meet unanticipated needs or respond to program
activities outside its usual categories.  The foundation has
slightly decreased funding for its rural poverty and resources
program.
     Approximately 35% of the Ford Foundation's program budget is
allocated for work in selected developing countries.  The
foundation recommends that grant applicants begin by sending a
short letter of inquiry to determine whether the foundation's
interests permit consideration of a formal proposal.
     Grant inquiries should be addressed to Barron M. Tenny, Vice
President, Secretary, and General Counsel, Ford Foundation, 320
East 43rd Street, New York, NY 10017, (212) 573-5000.
