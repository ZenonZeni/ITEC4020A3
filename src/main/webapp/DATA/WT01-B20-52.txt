<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>VINDICTIVE PROSECUTOR BLOCKS
JIMMY MONTGOMERY'S RELEASE WITH LAST MINUTE OBJECTION</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 8,</b> Oklahoma City, OK.&nbsp; The
release of paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery from life threatening
imprisonment was blocked at the last minute by an objection filed
by Richard Dugger, the prosecutor for the five county area where
Montgomery resides.&nbsp; After weeks of efforts by Oklahoma
NORML and numerous calls to Governor Frank Keating's office by
concerned citizens from around the country, Jimmy was finally
scheduled for release to house arrest this week.&nbsp; It was originally
planned that Montgomery would be hospitalized for the treatment
of anti-biotic resistant infections in his lower body.&nbsp; Now
he will remain confined to the prison where he does not even have
access to a shower or adequate clean bandages.&nbsp; He can only
bathe in the whirlpool shared by other prisoner patients,
exposing them to his infections and in turn, exposing him to
theirs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Last week President Clinton said that it is &quot;wrong to kill
people ... who are minding their own business.&quot;&nbsp; He did
not say whether it is also wrong to kill people by locking them
up and denying them proper medical care, but if action is not
taken quickly, Montgomery will not survive. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[Please call Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating at (405)
521-2342.&nbsp; Prosecutor Richard Dugger's home number is (405)
225-3678.]</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>(Meanwhile) Washington State
Arrests Medical Marijuana Patients And Activists Who Provide
Marijuana To Sick, Dying And Disabled Persons</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 5,</b> Seattle, WA.&nbsp; A federally
funded Washington State &quot;narcotics&quot; task force
(WestNet) arrested medical marijuana activists Joanna McKee and
Ronald Miller of Bainbridge Island, WA.&nbsp; McKee, is a
co-founder of the Green Cross Patient Co-op which promotes the
use of marijuana for medical purposes.&nbsp; Police valued the
marijuana seized at $300,000, but knowledgeable observers
consider this a gross exaggeration.&nbsp; A spokesman for the
task force said that they consider McKee &quot;just another
marijuana grower.&quot;</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McKee depends on a cane and a wheelchair to get
around and has spoken openly about providing marijuana for people
with AIDS, cancer, and various debilitating injuries.&nbsp; Last
week she told <i>Tacoma News Tribune</i> columnist C. R. Roberts,
&quot;There are a lot of people whose lives are depending on
this.&quot;&nbsp; Roberts wrote a column called &quot;Marijuana
may be illegal, but barring its medical use is the <i>real</i>
crime.&quot;&nbsp; His views reflect those of the majority of the
American people, but not those of the Clinton Administration
which is blocking research on the medical use of cannabis.&nbsp; President
Clinton is now celebrating the 50th anniversary of the defeat of
the last regime to actively persecute the sick and disabled as a
matter of policy.&nbsp; <u>The task force is just following
orders</u>.</p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[McKee and Miller are being defended by Seattle
NORML Legal Committee member Jeffrey Steinborn.&nbsp; The
Governor of Washington, Mike Lowry, can reached at (360)
