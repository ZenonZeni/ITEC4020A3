***************
SLANTS & TRENDS
***************


WHISTLEBLOWER UPDATE:  A Labor Department judge is slated to
hear arguments Jan. 31 on whether to grant whistleblower
status to a former employee of a sharps container
manufacturer who complained about the integrity of products
being shipped (MWN, Dec. 12, p. 206). In that case, DOL
Administrative Law Judge Samuel Smith ruled for the first
time the federal Environmental Protection Agency could
regulate sharps collectors under the Toxic Substances
Control Act .

THE LONG-AWAITED RULING could spell relief for whistleblower
Steve Balog. Dottie Balog, his wife, said she hoped the
government's budget problems would not interfere with the
Jan. 31 court trial. Much is riding on the decision. If
Steve Balog is granted whistleblower protection, then his
employer, Med-Safe Systems, would be barred from suing him.
Also, Balog could be eligible for back pay, legal fees, and
even his job, she said.

THE COST IS NOT EXCESSIVE for hospitals to switch from
incineration to either on-site autoclaves or regional
autoclave facilities for their medical waste management,
says a soon-to-be-released cost analysis by a New York
environmental group. "We're finding its a small part of
hospitals' operating budgets," said Center for Biology of
Natural Systems' Catherine Hill. "We think its feasible."
Hill said researchers focused on the "most accepted"
alternative to incineration in crunching numbers on the
attractiveness of abandoning incineration. The group, housed
at Queens College, also factored in the necessary waste
management costs after using the steam sterilizer.

MEDICAL WASTE BECAME A TARGET for the environmental group
when it embarked on a study of air pollution sources in the
Great Lakes (MWN, May 30, p. 84). That study recommended
medical waste be sterilized and landfilled, rather than
incinerated, to decrease dioxin compounds in the Great Lakes
region. According to Hill, EPA's dioxin numbers for medical
waste incinerators were accurate for the time data were
collected in 1989/1990. Since then, more than one-half of
the incinerators have shut down, so the report may not be an
accurate snapshot of today's dioxin burden, Hill noted.

THE GROUP's FINDINGS on the benefit of autoclaves is not
news to Vicky Jas at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center,
whose comprehensive cost analysis convinced the hospital to
shut down its incinerator and apply for a permit to operate
an autoclave (see story, p. 5).

JCAHO ISSUES BLUEPRINT FOR
HOSPITAL WASTE MANAGEMENT


     The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations (JCAHO) recently prescribed its plan for a
safe environment.

     According to the latest manual, hospital leaders
should: plan for waste management space, equipment and
resources; educate staff about the role of environment in
supporting patient care; develop standards to measure
hospital performance in managing and improving the
environment; and develop an Information Collection and
Evaluation System to continuously measure environmental
care.

     The manual outlines what should be included in a
hazardous materials and waste management plan, and the
standards for personnel to meet in selecting, handling,
storing, using and disposing of waste.

     For more information, contact JCAHO, One Renaissance
Boulevard, Oakbrook, Ill. 60181; 708-916-5635.

NRC REJECTS THREE SCENARIOS
FOR FUTURE OF LLW PROGRAM


     None of the three Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff
scenarios for the future of the commission's low-level
radioactive waste (LLW) program is satisfactory, NRC's
Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) concluded Dec.
29.

     Facing severe federal budget cuts, the staff report
looked at three scenarios: continue the current program,
reduce the program by eliminating or cutting back various
parts, or terminate all parts of the LLW program.

     The staff concluded the present program could not
continue at present budgetary levels, but the entire program
could not be abolished because that move would require major
changes in a number of pieces of federal legislation. The
only viable solution, therefore, is a drastically reduced
program.

     The major failing of the staff report "is the failure
to address the question of what the LLW program ought to be
in order to satisfy the mission of the NRC," ACNW Chairman
Paul Pomeroy said in his letter to NRC Chairman Shirley Ann
Jackson.

     The budgetary focus of the report fails to address
NRC's fundamental responsibility to protect the health and
safety of the public. "Budgetary reductions need to be made
in accordance with priorities set with reference to the
underlying mission of the NRC," ACNW said.

     Necessary elements in the reshaped LLW program are: a
staff that includes experts in each of the technologies
critical to evaluation of the siting, environmental impact,
operation and closure of LLW facilities; a program that
provides technical assistance to those preparing license
applications for LLW disposal facilities; a program that
maintains NRC's capability for processing license
applications from non-Agreement states for LLW disposal
facilities; and a program that identifies and supports
limited research activities in priority areas and assures
that the information value is maintained from studies that
are terminated or transferred to other programs.

NURSING STAFF INJURY is on tap in the new Institute of
Medicine (IOM) report to be released in mid-January. The
report-Nursing Staff in Hospitals and Nursing Homes: Is it
Adequate?- focuses on how the unprecedented change in the
health care industry has affected the occupational health of
nurses, as well as patient care. IOM kicked off the probe in
response to a congressional request. For information,
contact IOM, 202-334-2138.

LATEST MARKET REPORT PREDICTS
SAFETY SYRINGE SALES TO RISE


     More than 4.8 million needles and syringes were sold in
the United States in 1994, and safety syringe sales were
forecasted to jump at least 45 percent by the end of 1995,
said a new market report on the medical disposal market.

     Connecticut-based Theta Corporation predicted safety
syringe sales would increase more than 45 percent with unit
shipments to exceed 2.25 billion by the end of 1995.

     The report provided an in-depth analysis of the largest
U.S. disposal medical equipment products market. The latest
report, Dynamic Medical Disposal Market, forecasted market
trends through 2001 for the following products: needles and
syringes, procedure kits and trays, evacuated blood
collection tubes, respiratory therapy disposables and
infusion disposables.

Needle Sticks Drive Market

     According to Theta Corp., the most significant trend
affecting the medical disposables market is the increasing
awareness of the danger of bloodborne pathogen infections
from accidental needle sticks.  The greatest commercial
success will come from new features incorporated into
existing products offered by vendors who currently dominate
the market, the firm found.

     Safety needles and syringes are expected to reach
market penetration exceeding 80 percent by 2001, the report
predicted, and while the products may become more popular,
safety product prices will also decline dramatically. Since
1992, the U.S. Patent Office has approved more than 500
patents for safety features for syringes and needles.

     Today more than 60 percent of all surgical procedures
involve use of a kit, and the report charted the market for
the following procedure kits and trays: cardiovascular,
angiography and angioplasty, orthopedic, OB/GYN, ophthalmic,
endoscopic and others.

     Theta Corp. predicted sales of all respiratory therapy
disposables would reach 38.6 million units by 2001, and that
compound annual growth rates of 17.1 percent was anticipated
for sales of infusion sets from 1995 to 2001.

     Fifteen companies were selected for detailed profiles
that included information on product development, products
and marketing strategies: Baxter International Inc., Becton
Dickinson and Co., C.R. Bard, Inc., Hudson Respiratory Care
Inc., Invacare Corp., Isolyser Co., Inc., Johnson & Johnson,
Marquest Medical Products, Inc., MAXXIM Medical, Inc.,
Puritan-Bennett Corp., The Med-Design Corp., Sherwood
Medical, Siemens Medical System, Inc., Smiths Industries and
Sterile Concepts.

HRCC TO CONSIDER NATIONAL MODELS
FOR MINIMIZING MEDICAL WASTES


     The Healthcare Resource Conservation Coalition (HRCC),
an ad hoc group of suppliers, haulers and hospitals, will
review national models that have proven successful in
minimizing medical waste at its next meeting in May.

     The reach of the nonprofit communications group has
been expanding over the last year. While not included at
first, waste haulers have joined the group of those
interested in solving medical waste problems, said Mayo
Medical Center's Director of Waste Management Terry Horseth.
The group recently has incorporated as a nonprofit network
and includes 50 members, such as representatives from Baxter
International Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Beth Israel Hospital
and Kaiser Permanente.

     Horseth said everyone recognizes education is key in
keeping health care organizations, manufacturers, suppliers
and government informed on the issues. "There is no central
place to find out all the information. Everyone must keep
reinventing their own wheel," he said.

     The meetings have been valuable, explained Horseth,
since all players in medical waste management share
information on what is happening nationwide, as well as
finding solutions to thorny local problems. Medical waste
management issues vary as widely as state and local
regulations, and HRCC members have the advantage of keeping
up on ever-changing waste management and recycling markets.

     "Right now we're looking for success stories," said
Horseth, who touted recycling efforts at the Mayo Center in
Rochester, Minn. The next meeting is tentatively slated for
May in Chicago.

     HRCC offers a communications network for all members of
the health care community to tackle issues such as waste
minimization, waste and product management and government
regulation.

     For information on HRCC, contact Terry Horseth, 507-
284-1912.

ISWA FORMS NEW WORKING GROUP
TO RESPOND TO MEDWASTE ISSUES


     The International Solid Waste Association (ISWA) has
formed a new working group to deal with health care waste
issues.

     ISWA members have worked closely with the World Health
Organization in assisting countries in preparing their
national policies on health care waste management, said a
recent bulletin from The World Resource Foundation.

     The group has also named a new chairman: Bill Townend,
deputy director of the London Waste Regulation Authority
(LWRA). Townend represented ISWA on the European Union
Priority Waste Stream Project on health care waste that was
completed last year.

     For information on ISWA's new group, contact Bill
Townend, LWRA, Hampton House, 20 Albert Embankment, London

ACQUISITIONS DRIVE SUCCESS
FOR MID-SIZED WASTE FIRMS


     Mid-sized solid waste companies had the most pronounced
growth in the industry during 1995, with revenues increasing
69 percent to $2 billion, and the trend should continue,
according to a report by Raymond James & Associates, a
financial analysis company in St. Petersburg, Fla.

     The report found that acquisition growth accelerated
over the past year. The top 13 waste companies are expected
to increase their revenues by 21 percent, with a major
revenue component driven by acquisitions.

     On financing issues, the report explained, "We wish to
stress that the improvement in the cost of financing has
been most notable for the smaller waste service companies. A
longer track record leading to enhanced credibility has
enabled these companies to dramatically lower their costs of
capital and benefit not only from lower rates, but from the
access to longer term financing and attractively priced
equity."

     In general, the analysis said, long term financing
rates for all firms, as represented by 30-year Treasury
bonds, have dropped considerably, thus providing a backdrop
for continued aggressive acquisition.

Companies Lead Industry in a Torrid Acquisition, contact the
firm's William Fisher, 800-237-5643.

EPA ESTIMATES STAFF LAYOFFS
FROM REPUBLICAN BUDGET OFFER


     Up to one-fourth of the Environmental Protection
Agency's staff may be laid off by spring unless Republicans
substantially increase EPA's funding, said EPA Administrator
Carol Browner. EPA's budget could have dramatic implications
for its medical waste emissions rule and its long-awaited
report to Congress.

     About one-third of the workers who promulgate
regulations, issue permits and perform inspections could be
laid off if Congress approves the EPA appropriations bill
vetoed by President Clinton, agency officials said.
Researchers and employees involved in environmental cleanups
would not be cut. EPA officials were hesitant until now to
estimate the impact of the budget cuts on staffing.

     At a Dec. 18 press conference, President Clinton vetoed
the $5.7 billion spending bill, insisting the measure would
have cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent and safe
drinking water aid to local governments by 45 percent.

     In response, Sen. Christopher Bond (R-Mo.) argued that
the cuts were based on recommendations from organizations
including the National Academy of Public Administration.

AUTOCLAVING VIEWED AS APPEALING
FOR HOSPITAL WEIGHING WASTE OPTIONS


     Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center may become the
state's first facility to shut down an incinerator and open
an autoclaving facility in a dramatic move to save money and
avoid having to comply with costly new emission regulations.

     The medical center's Vicky Jas conducted a
comprehensive, 12-year cost analysis that compared
retrofitting the existing incinerator to shipping wastes
off-site, autoclaving or using a gas sterilizer. Autoclaving
was by far the least expensive option, she said.

     "We had the resources to evaluate these, while others
are running scared," said Jas, who added that many hospitals
have already inquired about when the facility will be up and
running.

     The Lebanon, N.H., facility is hoping to be granted its
state permit soon, begin testing the new autoclave facility
on Jan. 29, and have it on-line in February. Right now, the
hospital is spending $5,000 a week to ship the wastes off-
site. With tens of millions being slashed from the
hospital's yearly budget, staff had to look for less costly
alternatives.

     "None of us was crazy about autoclaving since there is
still waste at the end," she explained. But Jas said the
hospital said the gas sterilizer manufacturer could not
gather independent emissions data for permit approval.

     Another item that may be on the agenda for hospital
administrators to consider include training a certified
workforce who would be involved only with waste management
in the hospital complex. Jas said she is looking into this
option to beef-up the education of hospital staff who handle
wastes.

EPA AUDIT POLICY SPELLS RELIEF
FOR CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATORS


     Companies that report self-discovered environmental
violations within 10 days and act to correct those
violations will be eligible for reduced penalties or waivers
for civil violations and no criminal sanctions under the
Environmental Protection Agency's final policy on
environmental audits.

     The policy, which appeared in the Dec. 22 Federal
Register, does not apply to violations that harm human
health and the environment.

     The issue of EPA enforcement against self-discovered
violations has been a sticking point for many companies.

     Under the new approach, EPA retains its power to levy
fines that equal any economic gain created by the violation
in order to "preserve a level playing field." EPA also will
override state laws shielding results of corporate self-
audits from enforcement if the violations threaten public
health or the environment. At the same time, the agency said
"where a state has obtained appropriate sanctions needed to
deter such misconduct, there is no need for EPA action."

     The final policy is similar to an interim policy
released in March. The earlier statement applied only to
self-audits, while the final statement covers other self-
discovery steps such as due diligence. EPA defines due
digilence as systemic efforts to prevent, detect and correct
violations.

Audit Results Not 'Privilege'

     EPA will continue its policy on not routinely
requesting the results of corporate self-audits, although
the agency reiterated its position that environmental self-
audits and related corporate self-discovery activities are
not privileged information protected from public disclosure.
This contrasts sharply with an increasing number of state
laws that provide varying degrees of privilege for audit
results.

     EPA said it will reduce gravity-based civil penalties
by up to 75 percent. These penalties, which are based on the
severity of the pollution problem and not on economic gains,
could be waived. The policy spells out a list of conditions
that must be met to become eligible for reduced or no civil
penalties provisions.

NEW HAMPSHIRE WASTE REGULATORS
AWAIT EPA REPORT, AIR STANDARDS


     New Hampshire regulators are holding tight on amending
medical waste regulations until the Environmental Protection
Agency's long-awaited report to Congress is released, said
New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services' Carl
Woodbury.

     Woodbury said New Hampshire regulators are not only
anticipating EPA's report but also its new Clean Air Act
regulation for emissions from medical waste incinerators.
State regulations have already incorporated a treatment
standard similar to EPA's, he said.

     New Hampshire houses one commercial incinerator
operated by Waste Management of New England that accepts
medical waste, while there are approximately 15 small
incinerators at hospitals across the state.

     "A lot of material is still going to landfills,"
Woodbury noted. Under state regulations, medical waste must
be treated before disposal "to achieve high-level
disinfection plus a four log reduction 104 of Bacillus
subtilis, for example by infectious waste incineration,
steam sterilization, chemical disinfection, or gas
sterilization."

Autoclave Breaks New Ground

     The responsibility is on the manufacturer to prove
alternative treatment technologies are effective, Woodbury
said, noting that the state requires data with independent
laboratory confirmation. "We don't want to see just the
marketers," he added.

     But Vicky Jas, manager of the Dartmouth Hitchcock
Medical Center's Biosafety and Environmental Programs,
complained that the state had little regulation for
alternative treatment technologies, even the more
traditional autoclaving. "We really started from scratch,"
she said. "The only standard the state relied on was whether
the technology killed the bugs," Jas said.

     Woodbury said New Hampshire hospitals are eying how the
medical center is managing its wastes to decide what path to
follow in the wake of looming EPA regulation. In August, the
hospital shut down its incinerator and has applied to
operate a less-costly, commercial-sized autoclave to
sterilize wastes on-site.

     After extensive research involving a cost analysis, the
hospital opted to get out of the incinerator business, said
the state's medical waste regulator. "Other hospitals are
looking to them for guidance."

     Under New Hampshire regulations, there are certain
treatment and disposal exemptions. Limbs and recognizable
organs are to be disposed of by incineration or interment.
Non-infectious blood and body fluids and non-infectious
tissues processed by grinding may be disposed of in sanitary
sewers. Gloves, gowns and other materials that have not come
in contact with significant quantities of blood, body fluids
or secretions should not be handled as infectious wastes.
Certain animal carcasses need not be regulated as infectious
wastes, and sharp infectious wastes can be incinerated or
landfilled if treated first. Household sharp infectious
waste can be handled as municipal solid waste if
containerized.

     Medical waste cannot be stored at room temperature for
more than 72 hours, and waste stored at processing
facilities that receive waste from off-site generators
cannot be stored for more than seven days. The waste is
required to be stored and transported in a sealed, non-
permeable 3-mil polyethylene bag, placed in another bag of
similar construction and sealed.

     Sharp infectious waste, such as broken glass, scalpel
blades and hypodermic needles, must be segregated and en-
cased inside rigid, puncture-resistant containers before the
material is placed in polyethylene bags. Under New Hampshire
law, sharps are not required to be ground up and rendered
non-usable before disposal.

2925.

Around the States

NEW YORK - New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. (HHC)
President Luis Marcos announced that 900 hospital beds will
be eliminated from the system. Marcos said the dramatic cuts
would result in greater efficiency and save the city $80
million, according to local news reports. Marcos said the
move was necessary to remain competitive and that layoffs
were not out of the question. After the cut, HHC will be
left with 5,964 beds. At a December board meeting, Marcos
noted a "dramatic decline" in the city's occupancy rates.
Health care officials predict the city will eventually
eliminate some 10,000 hospital beds in the public and
private sector.
