     1                    (Whereupon the following occurred in open court at

     2           9:32 o'clock p.m.:)

     4           of persons having any matter to present before the Honorable

     6           of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the Honorable Ronald L.

     7           Buckwalter and the Honorable Stewart Dalzell, Judges in the

     8           United States District Court for the Eastern District of

    10                    God save the United States and this Honorable Court. 

    11           Court is now in session, please be seated.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good morning.

    13                    I think you should know the Court's view as to the

    14           argument today.  We deem this as for maybe I speak from the

    15           vantage point of an Appellate Judge, but we deem this for our

    16           benefit rather than for yours in that you have set forth in

    17           the comprehensive briefs and your proposed findings of fact

    18           and conclusions of law your positions.  

    19                    While, of course, you will proceed, we will

    20           interrupt you with -- I assume we will interrupt you with

    21           numerous questions, at least I know I have numerous questions

    22           after reading these.  And therefore, although we have given

    23           you time limits, those are your time limits, the Court has no

    24           time limits and therefore we, to the extent that we want

    25           clarification, we will go over those time limits, it doesn't


                    


                                                                             4

     1           reflect on either or any of the parties if we ask more

     2           questions of one party than of another or if our extensions

     3           come unequally for that purpose.

     4                    We believe that you shouldn't make plans to go by

     5           plane before lunch anywhere since it is possible that --

     6           likely that we will go beyond the lunch period, give

     7           everybody a break and then resume.  We tell you that at the

     8           outset so that you can know.

     9                    Anything else preliminarily?  Anything else

    10           preliminarily?

    11                    Okay, we will hear from counsel.

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  Good morning, your Honors.  My name is

    13           Christopher Hansen.  I'm one of the lawyers representing the

    14           ACLU plaintiffs in this case.

    15                    I'd like to begin by addressing two subjects that

    16           are not in dispute in this case that are extremely important

    17           to the plaintiff's analysis of this case.

    18                    The first is that this is a criminal statute, it's

    19           not a regulatory statute or an FCC regulation, it's a

    20           criminal statute.  It carries the penalties of fines,

    21           imprisonment and a criminal record.

    22                    Second, it is a criminal statute aimed at speech

    23           which all parties agree is constitutional and protected

    24           speech, at least for adults.

    25                    The rules of vagueness and overbreadth, which are


                    


                                                                             5

     1           the primary subjects I'm going to be addressing this morning

     2           are held to their strictest when either of these two criteria

     3           apply, either when they say the statute is a criminal statute

     4           or when it implicates First Amendment barriers, here we have

     5           both.

     6                    And thus the rules of vagueness and overbreadth in

     7           this context must be applied with particular strictness.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  On the other hand, this is a

     9           preliminary injunction request and the Supreme Court has made

    10           very clear that in preliminary injunctions the Court is not

    11           to reach out and decide the issues that are not absolutely

    12           essential at that time.  Is that not correct?

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, that's certainly correct. We think,

    14           however, it is going to be essential for you to not reach out

    15           but have to decide the issues of vagueness and overbreadth as

    16           they apply to this particular statute.

    17                    There are a couple of other features about the fact

    18           that this is a criminal statute that I would like to

    19           highlight, in addition to the fact that it carries the

    20           potential of imprisonment. 

    21                    The first is that it does require immediate

    22           compliance upon penalty of imprisonment.  Now, I cross-

    23           examined Mr. Olsen on my hypothetical, allow my clients to

    24           comply with this statute by 6:15 in the afternoon and it

    25           sounded extreme at the time because it is an incredibly tight


                    


                                                                             6

     1           schedule within which to comply with the statute. 

     2                    But the statute doesn't contain a phasing period, it

     3           doesn't contain a period of grace during which people can

     4           speak without the necessity of going to jail.  Indeed if my

     5           clients, if this Court were to uphold this statute at 6:00

     6           o'clock this afternoon, my clients would be in jeopardy for

     7           speech that they engaged in at 6:15, in jeopardy of

     8           imprisonment.

     9                    It  is also a very peculiar criminal statute in one

    10           other respect.  The statute says that the defenses change as

    11           technology changes.  Now, Mr. Ennis will primarily be

    12           addressing the offenses, but I'd like to highlight this one

    13           part of the defenses.

    14                    It is surely an odd criminal statute that behavior I

    15           engage in today is legal but tomorrow will be illegal because

    16           technology has changed between today and tomorrow.  It

    17           suggests that I have to keep track of all current technology,

    18           make sure I'm on top of the latest technology to make sure

    19           that I have defended myself against this statute.

    20                    And I think that feature highlights what is an

    21           important part --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What provision specifically are you

    23           referring to in the statute when you say the statute says

    24           that?

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  Subsection E says it is a defense to


                    


                                                                             7

     1           engage in reasonable and effective and so on measures in

     2           order to preclude minors from having access to this, to the

     3           material.  It says reasonable and effective measures under

     4           current technology. And indeed both amici and the Government

     5           make much of the notion that technology is rapidly changing

     6           in this area and what is not possible today may become

     7           possible in the future.  Indeed I expect Mr. Ennis will spend

     8           considerable time talking about how the Government's

     9           essentially conceding that the defenses are not really much

    10           available today, instead the Government is relying on its

    11           hope the defenses will be available in the future.

    12                    But what this highlights, to me anyway, is the

    13           nature of the medium that we're talking about because even if

    14           we were talking about a criminal statute applicable to

    15           constitutionally protected speech in the context of broadcast

    16           or in other contexts, if we're -- if we're worrying about CBS

    17           having to face those kinds of problems, CBS is -- and NBC,

    18           there are a limited number of speakers in the context of

    19           television and they have batteries of lawyers and they have

    20           batteries of people who review programs before they go on the

    21           air.

    22                    In this case we're talking about the most democratic

    23           means of speech yet devised.  It is an area of a medium where

    24           all of us can be both speakers and listeners, where entry

    25           into the marketplace of ideas is simple, is relatively


                    


                                                                             8

     1           inexpensive and it makes all of us as powerful as CBS news.

     2                    My Webpage can be seen by just as many people as CBS

     3           News' Webpage.  In that context it is difficult -- we have to

     4           remember we are then calling upon every single American to be

     5           able to define the exact parameters of vague--of the statute

     6           here, the exact parameters of indecency, the exact parameters

     7           of patent defensiveness.

     8                    Every single American may, as Mr. Olsen suggested,

     9           have to hire their own lawyer to determine what the precise

    10           contours of those phrases are.

    11                    It is because of the evolving and democratic nature

    12           of this medium that the use of the criminal statute in this

    13           context is a particularly onerous method of dealing with the

    14           problem here.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What is the problem?

    16                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, Congress perceives the problem to

    17           be that minors are obtaining access to material that are

    18           inappropriate for minors to be obtaining access to.  In our

    19           view, Congress has not made out evidence that that problem

    20           does exist.  In the examples, for example, and Mr. Schmidt

    21           provided us with a lot of examples of the kind of speech that

    22           the Government asserts is at issue here.  Much of that

    23           speech, in our view, would be encompassed within already

    24           existing criminal prohibitions of either obscenity or child

    25           pornography.  Indeed --


                    


                                                                             9

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Which I take it everybody agrees is

     2           entitled to absolutely no protection, obscenity and child

     3           pornography, that's established, correct? 

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  I think the Supreme Court has been

     5           crystal clear that that is established,  that's correct.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  And indeed Senator Exon, the sponsor of

     8           this statute, waved around, and indeed I think successfully

     9           waved around on the floor of the Senate what he called the

    10           Blue Book.  And the Blue Book consisted of pictures even more

    11           extreme than those you saw in the Coppolino book during the

    12           testimony stage, pictures that under any -- I think under

    13           most people's definition would be considered obscene.

    14                    But we're not talking about obscene speech here. 

    15           None of the plaintiffs is challenging prohibitions against

    16           obscene speech or against child pornography, we're talking

    17           about something that is outside the definition of what

    18           obscene speech is.

    19                    And the -- the issue of whether the two phrases,

    20           indecency and patent offensiveness, are either vague or

    21           overbroad.  It turns out after a careful reading of the

    22           Government's brief and the amici in support of the Government

    23           to be a fascinating case.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you understand the two phrases

    25           to be different or the same?


                    


                                                                            10

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  I understand the Government to be

     2           arguing that the two phrases are the same.  I don't think

     3           that argument necessarily makes sense.  I mean we -- the

     4           normal rule of statutory construction is that when  the

     5           Congress uses two different clauses or words, it means to

     6           convey two different concepts.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:   Yeah, but when the conference

     8           report specifically references Pacifica and Sable as the

     9           source of meaning for those, doesn't the Government have the

    10           better of the argument?  Well, I'm not deciding the

    11           consequences of this but as a matter of statutory

    12           construction that the terms "indecent" and "patently

    13           offensive" are interchangeable?

    14                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, there's no question that the FCC

    15           has defined -- has defined indecency using some of the patent

    16           offensiveness clause that is contained in the Communications

    17           Decency Act.

    18                    There are slightly different wrinkles.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right, and your point is that if

    20           they'd had the better of the argument if that case was

    21           applicable to this situation, I suppose.

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, that's -- that's absolutely true.

    23           And they'd have the better of the argument if this medium

    24           were identical to the broadcast medium.  The Government also

    25           says that indecency and patent offensiveness mean different


                    


                                                                            11

     1           things in different media.  And so I'm not sure we can easily

     2           borrow from the other media.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But don't we run into trouble since

     4           the patently offensive locution comes verbatim out of Supreme

     5           Court cases, wouldn't it be a bit of a leap for the three of

     6           us who at last report are not on the Supreme Court to say oh,

     7           that's unconstitutionally vague?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  No, I don't think it would be a leap at

     9           all.  I don't think the Supreme Court has ever found that

    10           that phrase -- either of the two phrases at issue in this

    11           case are not vague.  The closest the Supreme Court has come

    12           to commenting, if you will, on the vagueness of the patent

    13           offensiveness phrases is Pacifica, the seven dirty words

    14           George Carlin monologue case.

    15                    The Court in that case specifically does not reach

    16           the vagueness question, instead all they say is that in the

    17           context of this monologue, this monologue is punishable.  We

    18           agree that it is legitimate for the FCC to regulate this

    19           monologue, to make it go at three in the morning instead of

    20           three in the afternoon.  They don't reach the question of

    21           whether the FCC's definition of either indecency or patent

    22           offensiveness was unconstitutionally vague.

    23                    In addition to that, as I was suggesting a minute

    24           ago, we have some evidence from the Government in this case

    25           that the definition of indecency and patent offensiveness in


                    


                                                                            12

     1           the medium of cyberspace is different than its meaning in

     2           broadcasting.  I don't -- I'm not sure I can understand --

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that's not the Government.  What

     4           we have to look at, I mean how Mr. Coppolino and his

     5           colleagues interpret it is one thing, what we have to

     6           interpret as a law that Congress adopted and with all

     7           deference to Justice Scalia's views of statutory

     8           construction, you know, if we look at the conference report,

     9           et cetera, that's what we look at to find a meaning, not the

    10           Government's brief, isn't it?

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, I think that's -- I think that's

    12           exact.  I think first, with deference to Justice Scalia, I

    13           think you first look at the language of the statute, but I

    14           think the conference report -- I agree with your Honor, the

    15           conference report provides useful information in helping to

    16           interpret the language of the statute.

    17                    But I think there's one other thing that can be said

    18           about the depth -- the vagueness or lack of vagueness of the

    19           definition of indecency or patent offensiveness, either one,

    20           and that is I think we've come a long way since the Pacifica

    21           decision in terms of finding out whether we can accurately

    22           define what indecency means.

    23                    And this case, and the repeated citation to the FCC

    24           definitions of indecency I think is the most vivid example

    25           that whatever we were predicting in Pacifica we were going to


                    


                                                                            13

     1           be able to do, that is narrowly and tightly or precisely

     2           define vagueness, we've now learned we can't do it.  And this

     3           case provides any number of examples of why that's the case.

     4                    For example, the -- as the Court is aware, the

     5           obscenity test, the Miller test, includes patent

     6           offensiveness as well, but it also includes the element that

     7           the speech be prurient and it also includes the element that

     8           the speech have no serious value.

     9                    Well, in this case the Government hints at the

    10           notion that those concepts are somehow embedded in our

    11           definition of either indecency or patent offensiveness.  They

    12           don't ever explicitly say that and in fact at some points

    13           they seem to back away from it, but they certainly hint at

    14           it.

    15                    The FCC has found that prurience is not a necessary

    16           part of either indecency or patent offensiveness.  Indeed the

    17           George Carlin monologue itself, it's hard to see how anyone

    18           could find it prurient.  You might find it humorous or you

    19           might find it unhumorous, there are a lot of things you might

    20           say about it, but it's hard to see how anyone would be turned

    21           on by the George Carlin monologue.

    22                    So if we're in fact looking to the FCC or looking to

    23           prior cases as to what indecency  means, I think we have to

    24           reject the Government's notion to suggest that somehow this

    25           case is about prurience.  What --


                    


                                                                            14

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But both sides have cited a lot of

     2           FCC decisions, very helpfully.  One that I thought was rather

     3           interesting that I take it neither your organization nor the

     4           party involved thought to take to the Supreme Court was this

     5           very interesting case, Merrill Hansen, spelled the same way

     6           as your surname.  I don't know, any relation?

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  No relation, no relation, your Honor.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Where the two -- where the

     9           two disc-jockeys were talking about the Playboy article

    10           involving the alleged rape by Jim Baker of Jessica Hahn and

    11           even though the Commission agreed that it was newsworthy and

    12           I must say, reading the transcript myself, it seemed to me

    13           that the disc-jockeys who may have started out thinking they

    14           were going to make a joke of it, and when they found out at

    15           least in their view that Ms. Hahn really was raped.  And they

    16           said hey, this is really serious, this is bad stuff.  Okay?

    17                    Sounds to me like pretty constitutionally protected

    18           discussion of a public figure and the Commission says,

    19           acknowledging that it was newsworthy at the time, that the

    20           merit of the work is simply one of many variables and held

    21           that it was appropriate to fine them a forfeiture of $2,000

    22           for that.

    23                    Now, nobody said, nobody said a  constitutional boo

    24           to that decision, did they?

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, somebody should have.  But as far


                    


                                                                            15

     1           as I know, no one did.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But after Pacifica, could you say

     3           boo?

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, I think absolutely could.  I think

     5           that is the -- that case is one of the most perfect examples

     6           of how we have now learned that the effort we started, the

     7           road we started down in Pacifica to define indecency isn't

     8           working.  I mean, the Government in this case suggests that

     9           there's some sort of serious value component to patent

    10           offensiveness and indecency.  But then, as your Honor quite

    11           properly suggests, the FCC rejects the notion that there's a

    12           serious value component.

    13                    And if we put back into indecency or patent

    14           offensiveness prurience and serious value, we've recreated

    15           the definition of obscenity.  We then no longer need the

    16           concept of indecency.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But if you're right, wouldn't we

    18           have heard some echo in Sable, for example, some quibbling in

    19           Sable?  I mean I agree with you that Pacifica has been

    20           narrowed over time, but notably it hasn't been narrowed on

    21           the indecency point.  Wouldn't you agree with that?

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  No, I'm not sure I would agree.  I

    23           think there has continued to be ferment in the --

    24           particularly in the lower courts at least about the question

    25           of whether these, these clauses can be properly defined and


                    


                                                                            16

     1           whether they are vague or overbroad.

     2                    For example, in Alliance, which was argued recently,

     3           one of the issues lurking in Alliance -- it may not be

     4           reached by the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court's

     5           dealing with --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I know, we talked about that though

     7           and I think we've all reviewed the transcript and the word

     8           indecency didn't even come up.  

     9                    MR. HANSEN:  No, but --

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So we shouldn't hold our breath for

    11           that decision, should we?

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  No, and I don't think the Supreme

    13           Court, I suspect the Supreme Court won't give us guidance on

    14           that in that case, but my point is that the issue of whether

    15           the concept of indecency or patent offensiveness is

    16           unconstitutionally vague remains in ferment.  We in fact cite

    17           some lower court cases that in some context have found that

    18           those kinds of clauses are in fact unconstitutionally vague.

    19                    It is fair to say that some, there are courts that

    20           have said that given Pacifica we are going to say that that

    21           issue is foreclosed, but we think it's by no means.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In a criminal context?

    23                    MR. HANSEN:  No, and indeed --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Has there been any criminal case

    25           that has sustained, that you know of, let's say any Federal


                    


                                                                            17

     1           criminal case that has sustained the use of indecency?

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  No.  We looked very hard for it.  As

     3           far as I can determine there is only one other place where

     4           indecency or patent offensiveness, there are two, where

     5           they're a crime as opposed to some sort of regulation,

     6           broadcast and the Dial-A-Porn context, we looked very hard to

     7           see if any in the last 20 or 50 years anyone had ever been

     8           either charged or convicted of indecency in any of those

     9           contexts.  We were unable to find a single example.

    10                    We found a couple of cases in which people have been

    11           prosecuted for a statute that said you may not engage in

    12           obscene or indecent speech, the case seemed to go -- the case

    13           explicitly went off purely on the obscenity issue, but we

    14           found no example of a crime.

    15                    And indeed in Pacifica the Court suggested that the

    16           reason they were able to reach out and find the Carlin

    17           monologue on acceptably -- acceptable to channel it to some

    18           other part of the day, one of the reasons they were able to

    19           do that was because it was a regulatory context and not a

    20           criminal context.  They explicitly suggested that they might

    21           have reached a different result.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, this is your vagueness

    23           argument --

    24                    MR. HANSEN:  Correct.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- that you're in.  Okay.  You're


                    


                                                                            18

     1           going to get to your First Amendment -- I mean to your over-

     2           breadth argument?

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Absolutely, although I think they --

     4           yes, absolutely.  Although I think they are -- it's difficult

     5           to pull them apart.  It's certainly analytically possible to

     6           pull them apart.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's easy to do that, isn't it?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, but --

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You have different constitutional

    10           provisions.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  But the facts that are sort of relevant

    13           to them are identical.  For example, if you assume that

    14           prurience is no longer part of the definitions here or -- and

    15           if you assume that this act, these two phrases do include

    16           material of serious value, then I think it presents you

    17           right, flat out the issue of whether we now have an over-

    18           breadth problem, that is whether we are now reaching speech

    19           that is constitutionally protected for adults that has

    20           serious value, that although it is about sex is not about

    21           prurience.  

    22                    I think that -- I think we're flatly presented with

    23           the question of whether the Congress can criminalize such

    24           statutes.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  See, you may be right on the -- as


                    


                                                                            19

     1           an abstract question, if you were righting a law review

     2           article about what the vagueness rule should be here, but my

     3           two colleagues and I, because we're not the Supreme Court,

     4           have got to, as best we can, limit existing Supreme Court

     5           precedent and apply it here. 

     6                    And I have to tell you, Mr. Hansen, that I haven't

     7           found a hint in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.  You may

     8           well be right that they will say criminal is different, but I

     9           haven't seen it yet.  This may be the case where they do it,

    10           but our problem is we have to apply the Supreme Court's

    11           jurisprudence as it exists today on May 10th, 1996, not as it

    12           may apply because of your successful advocacy in the Supreme

    13           Court, wouldn't you agree?

    14                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, I certainly agree with that.  But I

    15           think that in forming your decision you can say to the

    16           Supreme Court, you can establish the factual record with the

    17           Supreme Court that we've looked at this particular statute

    18           and these particular phrases and what we have found is that

    19           the people involved in trying to help us define what they

    20           mean have not been able to define them for us.

    21                    I mean let's talk about some of the testimony that's

    22           come out.  The -- Mr. Schmidt who says that it would be

    23           indecent or patently offensive, the Vanity Fair cover would

    24           be indecent or patently offensive, Mr. Olsen who says that

    25           Playboy is indecent or patently offensive and that all the


                    


                                                                            20

     1           dirty words are indecent or patently offensive, the FCC which

     2           says the crude jokes are patently offensive.

     3                    On the other hand, and morality in media, one of the

     4           amici in this case which says that the discussion of gay

     5           rights in some parts of cyberspace is patently offensive or

     6           indecent.

     7                    On the other hand we have the Government suggesting

     8           that discussion of gay rights is not patently offensive, but

     9           the facts in this case suggest --

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But doesn't that --

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  -- we don't know how to define these

    12           terms.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But the problem with that is doesn't

    14           your argument ultimately prove too much because the indecency

    15           in patently offensive locutions, some of the patently

    16           offensive locution comes right out of the Miller

    17           jurisprudence.

    18                    And, for example, you've spent a good deal of time

    19           arguing with a good deal of force, I think, about the

    20           different community problems because it's one thing to

    21           broadcast in a local area, but cyberspace, once something is

    22           on it, it's there world wide.  But if we take that argument

    23           to its logical conclusion, we're going to read out the

    24           obscenity definition of Miller, aren't we?

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  No, I think because I think obscenity


                    


                                                                            21

     1           in Miller benefits from the interplay of all three factors. 

     2           I think if obscenity in Miller were just patent offensiveness

     3           I think we would be having trouble.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, the community issue because--

     5                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- because the patent offensiveness

     7           also has the limiting phrase by contemporary community

     8           standards and that of course also comes from Miller.

     9                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, that's one of the ways in which I

    10           think the application of this -- that particular phrase to

    11           this statute presents us with particular problems.  I mean in

    12           Miller we know pretty much now that the community standards

    13           applies to local community standards.  In this case we've got

    14           a whole series of proposals about what community standards

    15           means.  We don't know for sure whether it's national

    16           community standards or local community standards.  The

    17           Government's witness suggested it was local community

    18           standards, the conference report suggests it's national

    19           community standards.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Can we decide this case on the

    21           preliminary injunction phase of it without reaching the

    22           vagueness issue?

    23                    MR. HANSEN:  Sure, yes, absolutely you can.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Because you haven't told us how

    25           yet.


                    


                                                                            22

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I think there are two ways that

     2           you can.  I think one is -- and one is the over-breadth which

     3           you've now pushed me to a second time and I'll now go to --

     4                    (Laughter.)

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I don't even see a timer here.  Do

     6           you have a timer?

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We have  the clock, Judge Sloviter. 

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, well, I don't follow that.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I've been watching it.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, I'm used to yellow lights and

    11           green lights.

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  I may not have got it the first time,

    13           your Honor, but I got it the second time.

    14                    (Laughter.)

    15                    MR. HANSEN:  And the other way I think you can,

    16           before I go on to over-breadth, the other way I think you 

    17           can -- 

    18                    (Laughter.) 

    19                    MR. HANSEN:  -- is what Mr. Ennis is going to talk

    20           about and that is the whether it's technologically or

    21           economically feasible to comply with the statute.

    22                    If the statute is read to include material that is

    23           valuable both for adults and for minors --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We have to read the -- we have to

    25           read the statute the way it's written, don't we?  We'll talk


                    


                                                                            23

     1           to the Government about its effort to change the statutory

     2           language but our problem right now is not what the Supreme

     3           Court is going to do because the Supreme Court may surprise

     4           us all and not take this case.  We have an obligation to

     5           decide the case in front of us.

     6                    Now, on what is the narrowest ground on which we can

     7           decide this preliminary injunction issue?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I'm not sure I know what the

     9           narrowest way is.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  But I think you can say that the act,

    12           as written, reaches speech that is constitutionally protected

    13           both for minors and for adults.  I think the first question

    14           is whether it reaches speech that is constitutionally

    15           protected for adults, I don't think there's really any

    16           serious dispute about that.  I also don't think, as for the

    17           reasons Mr. Ennis will be discussing, I don't think there's

    18           that much serious dispute that an awful lot of adults are

    19           going to be precluded from obtaining access to this kind of

    20           speech as a result of this act.

    21                    I mean just to take the most simple example, if we

    22           accept the credit card screening mechanism that the

    23           Government suggests, there are an awful lot of adults that

    24           don't have credit cards and that won't be able to obtain

    25           access to speech that is constitution-- they're


                    


                                                                            24

     1           constitutionally entitled to get simply because they don't

     2           have a credit card.

     3                    I mean it reminds me of one of the exhibits the

     4           Government suggested in which they said that every 15 year

     5           old in America is computer literate.  Well, there are 15 year

     6           olds in America that aren't literate, much less computer

     7           literate.  Similarly, there are adults that don't have credit

     8           cards and under this scheme won't be able to obtain access to

     9           this information.

    10                    So the first issue and the issue where you can stop

    11           if you reach this issue is whether this will prevent adults

    12           from having access to information that they are

    13           constitutionally entitled to.  It's the Butler argument, it's

    14           the Sable argument.  That is that what we have done in this

    15           context is we have, in the guise of protecting children,

    16           we've prevented adult, we've required that all speech be

    17           brought down to the level acceptable to the most vulnerable

    18           minor.

    19                    But if that, if you are unpersuaded by that part of

    20           the argument, then I think you also have to go ahead and

    21           reach the question of whether the speech in this case is

    22           protected from minors as well as for adults.  It is clear

    23           that minors do have rights to speech, it's clear that minors

    24           do have rights to obtain access to speech.

    25                    In this instance what we have is a huge volume of


                    


                                                                            25

     1           speech that the undisputed testimony shows is valuable for

     2           minors.  And let me take a couple of the most obvious

     3           examples.

     4                    The safer sex information is probably the most

     5           obvious example.  The exhibits in the record and the

     6           testimony from the witnesses indicate that a great many

     7           minors, particularly older minors, are in fact sexually

     8           active.  Whether we like that or not is irrelevant, the fact

     9           is that they are sexually active.  And in order to protect

    10           themselves from diseases including the fatal disease of AIDS,

    11           in order to protect themselves from pregnancy which is of

    12           course a constitutional right for minors as well as for

    13           adults, it is important, it's not merely -- it's vital that

    14           they obtain access to the kinds of speech that my clients

    15           engage in.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How do you answer the Government's

    17           argument that the act couldn't possibly be read to apply to

    18           information of that sort?

    19                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I think there are -- I think the

    20           answer to it is embedded in the colloquy Judge Dalzell and I

    21           were having, that is this act prohibits speech that has

    22           serious value.  The Government's suggesting really that this

    23           case is really just about pornography, it's just about

    24           really, really sexually explicit stuff.  Well, it's not about

    25           obscenity, it's not about that level pornography, it's not


                    


                                                                            26

     1           about prurience because prurience is not an element of this,

     2           not a necessary element about this and it's not about serious

     3           value because speech that has serious value is punishable

     4           under this statute.

     5                    Well, if that's the case, it seems to me safer sex

     6           information is most certainly at jeopardy under this statute.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Government suggests that we

     8           read this in the context of a conference report, is that

     9           correct?

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  Correct, yes.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But didn't the conference report

    12           specifically exclude a deletion of serious value?

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  No, it's the other way around.  The--

    14           one of the --

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It excluded, didn't it exclude,

    16           wasn't there an effort to put in an exclusion from the

    17           statute for --

    18                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, yes.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- I used my words -- I thought I

    20           used my words carefully.

    21                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, I'm sorry.  The --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  There was an effort to exclude from

    23           the scope of the statute --

    24                    MR. HANSEN:  Matters of serious value.  That is

    25           there was an effort to make --


                    


                                                                            27

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If you haven't, I mean, isn't --

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, your Honor.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- that important?  And why don't

     4           you stress that in the argument.

     5                    MR. HANSEN:  Okay.

     6                    (Laughter.)

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, the one -- one member of Congress

     8           proposed that the statute substitute, harmful minor statute

     9           be substituted for the indecency and patent offensiveness.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's a separate issue.  

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, harmful to minors includes

    12           prurience and includes value.  Congress explicitly rejected

    13           that alternative and both for the reasons you suggested and

    14           for the reason I'm now suggesting, Congress made, I think,

    15           crystal clear that value is part of this statute.  And if you

    16           engage in speech that is about sex, even if it has value, you

    17           risk going to jail under this statute.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I would like to know because --

    19           well, you've got about ten minutes left on this.  Let's

    20           assume we and/or the Supreme Court agree with you and the CDA

    21           is held unconstitutional.  So Senator Coates and Senator Exon

    22           come to you and say Mr. Hansen, you are obviously the right

    23           person with Mr. Ennis to talk to, here's the pen, write me a

    24           CDA.  Could you write a --

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  Somehow I don't think that will happen.


                    


                                                                            28

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could you write a child a CDA that

     2           passes constitutional muster?

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  I'm not sure you could.  I mean

     4           Ginsburg suggests that a harmful to minors statute might well

     5           be constitutional.  The question then would be whether you

     6           could apply that standard in the context of cyberspace and I

     7           think the answer to that would, at least in large measure,

     8           depend upon the ability to comply with the statute which is--

     9           which is largely sort of the defenses issues that Mr. Ennis

    10           is going to be addressing.  My view is no, you could not.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So therefore the issue really is

    12           medium specific is what your argument is?

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, there's no question that the issue

    14           is medium specific.  All the case law and the defendants

    15           admit that whether -- that the rules are different from

    16           medium to medium and that what may be, for example, indecent

    17           in TV is not indecent here.  What may be an accept --

    18           constitutionally acceptable rule in the area of broadcast is

    19           not -- may not be a constitutionally acceptable rule here.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So your position is then that you

    21           would give the pen back to Senator Exon and Senator Coates

    22           and just say I'm terribly sorry but for this medium we can't

    23           do it?  Is that -- is that your position?

    24                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, yes, I would say that and then I

    25           would also say to Senators Exon and Coates: but I have a


                    


                                                                            29

     1           better solution for you to the problem that you're troubled

     2           about and that solution is the whole constellation of PICs

     3           and Surfwatch and the other mechanisms that empower parents

     4           to be able to prevent their children from having access to

     5           indecent material and yet don't infringe on constitutionally

     6           protected rights, either for children or for adults.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And they say to you that's okay,

     8           that's great, how do we make sure this happens, they say, we

     9           want to give you a law to make sure this happens.

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  I think my first answer would be relax

    11           for a second, it's happening.  I mean, you know, all of the--

    12           we have considerable evidence that PICs is coming along, it's

    13           going to be up very soon.  We have considerable evidence that

    14           AOL is work-- and the other on-line services are working

    15           rapidly to improve and tighten and strengthen their parental

    16           control mechanisms.  

    17                    The attention that this act has gotten and that this

    18           case has gotten has been enormous impetus toward people

    19           finding those kinds of parental --

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What level of scrutiny do we apply

    21           to this statute?

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  I don't think there's any question.  I

    23           think the Government concedes that this is -- that you have

    24           to find -- in order to uphold this statute you have to find,

    25           you have to apply strict scrutiny and you have to find that


                    


                                                                            30

     1           there is no -- that it is narrowly tailored.  Both

     2           requirements have to be found here before this statute can be

     3           upheld.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Have you commented on the narrow

     5           tailoring?

     6                    MR. HANSEN:  No, the narrow tailoring largely goes,

     7           I think, to the defenses which I think Mr. Ennis is going to

     8           address although there isn't --

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What do you mean the narrow

    10           tailoring goes to the defenses?  Can't you have a free speech

    11           case in which the statute doesn't have any written-in

    12           defenses?

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Isn't that part of the basic

    15           concept of what we're supposed to do when we look at whether

    16           something's protected under the first amendment?

    17                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, I think that -- I think that part

    18           of the question is, is the definition of speech here

    19           sufficiently narrowly tailored that it gets at the problem

    20           that Congress was trying to get at and doesn't reach out and

    21           get a -- and create other problems.  And I think for the

    22           reasons, all the reasons we've been talking about this

    23           morning, I think this speech clearly does reach out to speech

    24           well beyond that which the Government's professed interest

    25           covers.


                    


                                                                            31

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Mr. Hansen, I've been concerned

     2           throughout this, my involvement in this, about the question

     3           of this being media specific.  And if it is media specific,

     4           what is your position is the media it's most analogous to and

     5           what is the Government's position.

     6                    But I don't want you to speak for the Government.

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Our position certainly is that if we

     9           are to draw an analogy, print would be the appropriate

    10           analogy because in this -- but I think we would suggest to

    11           you that this is a medium different than all other media in

    12           the sense of its democratizing and many to many qualities. 

    13                    That is almost all the other media, with the

    14           possible exception of telephone, is a relatively limited

    15           number of speakers giving out information to a large number

    16           of listeners.  One of the real marvels of this medium is it's

    17           making us all speakers and listeners and thus we think it's

    18           entitled the highest protection because it enable-- it

    19           empowers the most number of speakers.

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Thank you.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I want to get back for a second

    22           because it goes, I think, to your over-breadth argument here

    23           where you argue about that some minors, older minors should

    24           be entitled -- for example, sexually active minors.  But

    25           doesn't that undermine -- you would agree that Congress


                    


                                                                            32

     1           surely has the power to define who a minor is.

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And any definition it comes up with

     4           is by definition one size fits all because if you get back

     5           from that don't you drive the courts to determine, for

     6           example, is this -- is 12 mature or is this child

     7           sufficiently mature, this one's sexually active, this one's

     8           not?  

     9                    And so to avoid that kind of unedifying wildly

    10           inefficient system, Congress as every legislature has the

    11           inherent power to say who is a minor and who isn't.  Isn't

    12           that right?

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, I think that's right, but I think

    14           their definition of the minor in the context of this statute

    15           has to bear some relationship to a valid governmental

    16           purpose.  That is, if they decided that a minor was 30, I

    17           think we would all have little difficulty throwing that out

    18           because we believe that there are 25 year olds who have, you

    19           know, the sufficient maturity and sufficient need for the

    20           kinds of speech we're talking about here that they ought to

    21           be able to have access to it.

    22                    Similarly, I think, we can say given the nature of

    23           the speech involved here and given the realities of the world

    24           that drawing the line at 18 in this context approaches the

    25           same level of irrationality in the sense that there are


                    


                                                                            33

     1           certainly 17 year olds who have sufficient maturity and

     2           sufficient --

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But isn't that an argument that you

     4           should make to Congress and not to us?

     5                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I think it's --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I mean could we say as a matter of

     7           constitutional law that the -- that the drawing the line at

     8           18 was so irrational as to violate, I assume, due process?

     9                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, I think you can.  I think you can--

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You want us to say the statute

    11           would be constitutional if it was to 14?

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  No, I don't want you to say that, but I

    13           do -- but I do think --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, then I don't understand what

    15           this argument goes to.

    16                    MR. HANSEN:  The question is whether this statute is

    17           reaching out to a great deal of information that basically

    18           everyone concedes is valuable, at least for a large number of

    19           minors.  And if it is in fact speech that is valuable for a

    20           large number of minors, not only not harmful but valuable,

    21           then the statute is over-broad even as it applies to minors

    22           and not just as it applies to adults.  And I think that's how

    23           I would use the question.

    24                    And I think -- 

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.


                    


                                                                            34

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  I think there is some notion to the

     2           fact that the Government, the Congress can draw some lines in

     3           this area but where the line sweeps in large numbers of

     4           minors who are appropriately, who ought to be appropriately

     5           able to see this kind of information --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Based on your reading of the

     7           jurisprudence, how substantial does the over-breadth have to

     8           be for it to cross the line of impermissibility?

     9                    MR. HANSEN:  I think if it -- if more than a small

    10           number of applications are involved then I think you have

    11           substantial over-breadth.  That is I think the over-breadth--

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What's your citation for that

    13           proposition?

    14                    MR. HANSEN:  I don't have one off the top of my head

    15           but I'll have one by the time of rebuttal, if you'd like.

    16                    (Laughter.)

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Fair enough.

    18                    MR. HANSEN:  I think the case -- the non substantial

    19           over-breadth cases, the cases that say we -- there's

    20           substantial over-breadth here --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It was in your brief and in the

    22           ALA's brief.

    23                    MR. HANSEN:  They're in both briefs and they talked

    24           about the question -- it is possible to hypothesize a small

    25           number of applications that might be constitutionally


                    


                                                                            35

     1           protected and that's not what we're talking about in over-

     2           breadth.  And that's the line of cases I am drawing on for

     3           the answer.

     4                    In our view the -- one of the crucial parts of this

     5           case is that which we've just been discussing and that is the

     6           nature of this medium here.  We have what is a new medium, is

     7           an enormously exciting medium, it is a democratizing medium

     8           and it is an enormously evolving medium.

     9                    The testimony was undisputed that this medium is

    10           changing on a daily basis and changing rapidly.  This statute

    11           not only infringes constitutional rights in the ways we've

    12           talked about this morning but it also has the potential for

    13           stifling this new and exciting and dramatic medium and in our

    14           view this Court should find the statute unconstitutional.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.   

    16                    Shall we call Mr. Ennis?

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Ennis?

    19                    MR. ENNIS:  Good morning, your Honors.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning, Mr. Ennis.

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  Bruce Ennis representing the ALA

    22           plaintiffs.

    23                    I'm going to speak primarily about the Subsection E

    24           safe harbor defenses to Subsection D's criminal prohibition. 

    25           To put it in context, I think that it's fair to say that


                    


                                                                            36

     1           unless speakers can use the safe harbor defenses authorized

     2           by Subsection E, then Subsection D standing alone would

     3           constitute a flat ban on speech that is constitutionally

     4           protected for adults.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let me ask you a general

     6           proposition, do you know of any criminal law that might have

     7           been unconstitutional but for defenses that were put in?  I

     8           mean this, the whole proposition that you can

     9           constitutionalize a possible over-broad or vague criminal law

    10           by defenses is a new one to me but there may be examples out

    11           there.  Can you think of any?

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, Judge Sloviter, I think that's a

    13           key question in our case.  I'm not aware of any.  There --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I guess it's a question for the

    15           Government then, giving them advance notice.

    16                    MR. ENNIS:   The closest I can think of that, your

    17           Honor, are examples from broadcast and Dial-A-Porn but

    18           they're not like this law.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But they're not criminal statutes,

    20           are they?

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, both -- yes, they are both

    22           criminal statutes.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  Though the FCC has never sought or

    25           obtained criminal sanctions in the broadcast area against


                    


                                                                            37

     1           indecent speech.  And --

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, although Pacific and Southern

     3           Company, Incorporated, licensee of radio station KSD-FM, when

     4           it got fined -- they called it a forfeiture of $2,000, smells

     5           like a fine to me.

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, it certainly is and it's an

     7           administrative fine, your Honor.  All I'm pointing out is

     8           that the Supreme Court stressed in its Pacifica decision that

     9           it was not dealing with a criminal sanction.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Quite right, you're quite right.

    11                    MR. ENNIS:  But let me return to your question

    12           because it is an important question.  In every other medium

    13           where Government attempts to regulate or criminalize

    14           indecency, in every other medium speakers have a sure and

    15           safe way of complying with the act, all speakers.

    16                    For example, in broadcast, speakers know that if

    17           they broadcast the indecent material only in the evening

    18           hours that are specified by FCC as okay for indecent

    19           material, they are at no risk whatsoever of any governmental

    20           statute.

    21                    In the dial-a-porn context which only regulates

    22           commercial dial-a-porn, all commercial providers of dial-a-

    23           porn can use a credit card which is a complete defense, all

    24           speakers in the commercial dial-a-porn context have a sure

    25           and safe and completely effective safe harbor.  That is


                    


                                                                            38

     1           emphatically not the case with respect to this act.

     2                    So it does raise the question you've asked, is there

     3           ever an example in which you can ban speech and then put the

     4           affirmative burden on the speaker to show with evidence and

     5           an affirmative defense to a prosecution that their speech

     6           somehow comes within a safe harbor and the answer is no.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And then in -- and of course

     8           if the Government disagrees though we expect it will tell us,

     9           but to whom is the safe harbor provision, the defense

    10           provision available?  Is it available for all of the persons

    11           who might, individuals who might be held liable under A and D

    12           or only some of them?

    13                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor, the defense on its face is

    14           available and in fact must be raised as an affirmative

    15           defense by all of the millions of speakers who use the

    16           Internet.

    17                    In reality, as I hope to show this morning, the

    18           defense is not available to any speakers who use the Internet

    19           except for commercial speakers who charge for access to their

    20           speech.  With that sole exception, not one of the so-called

    21           safe harbor defenses can with any reasonable --

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, apparently those defenses are

    23           merely evidence, as I understand Mr. Keeney's letter to our

    24           colleagues in New York, right?

    25                    MR. ENNIS:  That's at most what they are.


                    


                                                                            39

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  At most evidence.

     2                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, that's right, the Keeney letter--

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But it's still going to be up to a

     4           jury to determine whether that carries today, right?

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  That's correct, Judge Dalzell.  The

     6           Keeney letter says that at most, if a defendant takes the

     7           steps the Government suggests, a speaker takes the steps the

     8           Government suggests, at most that would be, quote,

     9           "substantial evidence" which that defendant in a criminal

    10           prosecution could then argue to a jury would qualify for the

    11           safe harbor defense.

    12                    But it would be up to disparate juries throughout

    13           the country.

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But in a criminal setting the

    15           burden would always be on the Government to prove that it was

    16           not a good faith defense, it would never be upon the --

    17                    MR. ENNIS:  You would think so, Judge Buckwalter,

    18           but-- 

    19                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Or even in insanity.

    20                    MR. ENNIS:  But that is not the way this statute is

    21           set up, which was Judge Sloviter's question.  This statute,

    22           Subsection -- let me try and break it out.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  If you start with Subsection D,

    25           Subsection D flatly prohibits the display of patently


                    


                                                                            40

     1           offensive speech in a manner that would be, quote, "available

     2           to minors."

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  As we've shown in our proposed findings

     5           of fact 855, we've collected all the evidence, there's no

     6           dispute on it, you cannot display speech on the Internet in a

     7           way that's broadly available to adults without that speech

     8           necessarily also being broadly available to minors.

     9                    So what that means is if you just look at Subsection

    10           D by itself, Subsection D criminalizes the display of speech

    11           on the Internet that would be broadly available to adults

    12           because it necessarily would be broadly available to minors

    13           as well.

    14                    Thus unless the Subsection E safe harbor defenses

    15           narrow the sweep of Subsection D, Subsection D would quite

    16           clearly be unconstitutional under Bolger, under Sable and

    17           under Butler, all of which unanimously hold that Government 

    18           cannot constitutionally ban speech to adults even for the

    19           purpose of protecting minors.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.  And what did the trick in

    21           Sable was the defense.

    22                    MR. ENNIS:  It was the defense.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that's what Congress did, at

    24           least what Congress thought they were doing.  Isn't it fair

    25           to say what Congress thought they were doing in this statute


                    


                                                                            41

     1           was they reached into Pacifica and they reached into Sable

     2           and they threw it in to the CDA and they said it's got to be

     3           constitutional because the Supreme Court says so.

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  Exactly right, Judge Dalzell.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Isn't that a fair characterization?

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  That is completely fair.  The

     7           legislative history bears that out.  Congress thought --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What about the use of the word

     9           "knowingly?"  Throughout this long proceeding I haven't heard

    10           anybody focus on the fact that Subsection D to which you

    11           refer specifically makes criminal only that which is

    12           knowingly sent to persons under 18 and knowingly permits

    13           under Subsection 2.  Wouldn't that be part of the

    14           Government's required case in chief and what does it mean?

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  I'm not sure, the Government would have

    16           to tell you what that means. It's unclear to me what it

    17           means.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But it's in there.

    19                    MR. ENNIS:  It is in there and -- but and also is in

    20           there for Subsection D, but for Subsection D --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It is D I'm talking about.

    22                    MR. ENNIS:  On its face it would simply mean knowing

    23           that you have displayed speech.  If --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Don't you have to also know that

    25           it's a person under 18?


                    


                                                                            42

     1                    MR. ENNIS:  No, under D you only have to know that

     2           you have displayed speech in a manner that is, quote,

     3           "available" to a person under 18, whether anyone under 18

     4           ever had access to the speech or not.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, then that's not A, you're not

     6           talking about D(1)(A), you're talking about D(1)(B).  And one

     7           says knowingly.  In other words, whoever in interstate or

     8           foreign communications knowingly uses any interactive

     9           computer service to display in a manner available to a person

    10           under 18 is part of the Government's burden to show that you,

    11           that the speaker or sender knew that there were people under

    12           18 receiving it?

    13                    MR. ENNIS:  I think that the fair inference from the

    14           statute would be that that would be so, but I don't know what

    15           the Government's position on that is.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, lots of times we have been

    17           advised to construe a statute to construe the knowingly

    18           language in such a way as to make the statute constitutional. 

    19           That's a construction that is consistent with the language of

    20           the statute itself, we don't have to cut out any -- any

    21           provision.

    22                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes. 

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Isn't your point that America On

    24           Line, for example, or Compuserve has to know, they have to

    25           know because they'd be stupid not to know that it is


                    


                                                                            43

     1           available to people under 18 because there's no way of not

     2           making it available to people under 18?

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  That is the whole point, Judge Dalzell. 

     4           And if you make the speech broadly available to adults on the

     5           Internet, if you wish to speak to the world, this speech will

     6           necessarily be available to minors as well and you will know

     7           that it is available to minors as well and therefore --

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you won't be heard to say I

     9           didn't know.

    10                    MR. ENNIS:  Right.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Burrington could not appear in a

    12           courtroom in the District of Ohio where he's from AOL,

    13           whoever Compuserve is, and say oh, I didn't know there were

    14           people under 18.  He'd be cut to shreds by Mr. Coppolino and

    15           his friends on cross-examination, wouldn't he?

    16                    MR. ENNIS:  That's correct.  That's why Subsection D

    17           bans display of speech in a manner that's available to minors

    18           on the Internet.  And your question was didn't Congress

    19           simply think this is okay, we'll borrow the dial-a-porn

    20           analogy?  Unfortunately, Congress did not hold hearings on

    21           the nature of the Internet and it did not focus on this

    22           question.  It thought that the dial-a-porn analogy would

    23           work, it doesn't because the vast majority of speakers on the

    24           Internet do not charge for access to their speech.

    25                    There is a small subset of speakers on the Internet


                    


                                                                            44

     1           who do charge for access to their speech and those speakers

     2           can, with the dial-a-porn analogy, require the presentation

     3           of a credit card before they allow access to their speech. 

     4           It is a defense for that small subset of speakers.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Therefore your argument goes

     6           perversely the CDA if it were upheld, the people who could

     7           easiest, who could comply with it the easiest are precisely

     8           the pornographers.

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  It's even more than that, your Honor. 

    10           That's correct but it's even more than that.  The

    11           pornographers, the commercial pornographers who are charging

    12           for access to their speech were requiring credit cards before

    13           this act was passed.  They would continue to require credit

    14           cards if this act were enjoined, they would continue to

    15           require credit cards if the act were repealed.  This act does

    16           nothing to protect minors from the commercial speech by

    17           commercial purveyors of sexually explicit speech because they

    18           already require credit cards.

    19                    What the act does instead is to burden the huge

    20           range of non-commercial speakers on the Internet and say to

    21           them you cannot make your speech available for free to the

    22           world unless you carry the affirmative burden of coming

    23           within the safe harbors.

    24                    There are only three possible  types of safe harbors

    25           the Government has suggested and none of them can be used by


                    


                                                                            45

     1           non-commercial speakers.  The three categories I think can

     2           usefully be thought of as falling into three groups.  One is

     3           called charging, another would be called screening and a

     4           third would be called warning.  I think that's a fair way to

     5           think of these.

     6                    We just talked a little bit about the charging.  You

     7           can charge for your speech on the Internet but the evidence

     8           is undisputed that the only speakers who can use, require a

     9           credit card before giving access to their speech are

    10           commercial speakers who are actually charging for their

    11           speech.

    12                    Credit card companies simply will not verify credit

    13           cards for non-commercial transactions, they don't do it. 

    14           Therefore if I have a Webpage and I want to make my speech

    15           available for free, I don't have the option of using the

    16           verified credit card defense.  No credit card company will

    17           verify it.  And that's true for the vast majority of speakers

    18           on the Internet.

    19                    So we can forget charging as a safe harbor defense

    20           for most speakers.  That brings us to screening.  Screening

    21           requires two things:  screening the content of the material

    22           to decide which material would be inappropriate for minors

    23           and therefore would have to be segregated into a different

    24           area and then would require screening for age, so that when

    25           people attempt to access the material that is the adults only


                    


                                                                            46

     1           material, you would be able to determine whether the person

     2           attempting to access the adult material was an adult or a

     3           minor.

     4                    The evidence is quite clear on that that you cannot,

     5           there's no technological way to screen for age based on

     6           current available technology, it simply can't be done.  And

     7           in huge areas of the Internet News Groups, IRC Chat, lists or

     8           mail exploders, it is technologically impossible for the

     9           speaker to get an adult ID number or a credit card number, it

    10           can't be done.

    11                    And I want to emphasize something here because we've

    12           spent most of the time in this case talking about Webpages

    13           and the World Wide Web because that's a popular way of

    14           speaking on the Internet.  We haven't spent as much time

    15           talking about  News Groups, Chat Rooms and mail exploders for

    16           the very good reason that there's no dispute that the safe

    17           harbor defenses can't be used in those areas, credit card and

    18           adult access codes can't be used on those areas. 

    19                    But the important point is those are huge areas of t

    20           he Internet.  There are hundreds of thousands of messages a

    21           day that are posted to News Groups.  So we've concentrated a

    22           lot on the World Wide Web, but when we realized that this law

    23           bans speech in all those areas of the Internet, we're talking

    24           about substantial number of applications.

    25                    The third possible way of coming within a safe


                    


                                                                            47

     1           harbor is the Government has suggested there are really two

     2           ways to --

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Can you go back to the one before

     4           for a minute?

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  Sure.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You argue that screening becomes

     7           ineffective or unusable because of the need for a common

     8           gateway interface?  Could you -- I think you argued that in

     9           your brief?

    10                    MR. ENNIS:  Well --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would you just bring us into that,

    12           explain why that is?

    13                    MR. ENNIS:  The reason that is in news groups, chat

    14           rooms and list services is there is no simultaneous

    15           communication between the speaker and the listener and the

    16           listener has no way of communicating directly with the

    17           speaker.  So it's not possible to transmit the adult ID code

    18           or the credit card number in those mediums of communication. 

    19                    On Web sites it is possible, it is theoretically and

    20           technologically possible for the speaker and the listener to

    21           communicate interactively.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The big companies don't use comment

    23           room except common gateway interface.  Am I misreading the

    24           testimony?

    25                    MR. ENNIS:  No, you're -- you're completely correct,


                    


                                                                            48

     1           Judge Sloviter.  I was just trying to explain that in Web

     2           sites in general it is possible to have that kind of two-way

     3           exchange of information to send adult ID codes and credit

     4           card numbers back and forth, but for all of the Web sites

     5           that are offered by the major on-line service providers,

     6           those Web sites do not have the CGI common gateway

     7           interference script capacity that is needed to have that

     8           dialogue, so those Web sites can't do it.

     9                    The only Web sites really that can do it are

    10           separate commercial Web sites that are set up by commercial

    11           providers of sexually explicit material.  And they do it and

    12           they require credit card payment.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, you were going to your third,

    14           the warning.

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  The third is give warning.  The

    16           Government suggested there are basically two ways of coming

    17           within this safe harbor defense and that is to tag your

    18           speech, to self label your speech in some way as

    19           inappropriate for minors or to register your speech with the

    20           Internet Yellow Pages or with one or ten or fifty of the 200

    21           and so additional directories of Internet listings.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Are we to take that point seriously

    23           in light of what's happened to Compuserve?  Because they did

    24           take it and with that service that's in question that you

    25           brought to us, to our attention, it is, it says it's adult,


                    


                                                                            49

     1           it's tagged.  But it didn't prevent the headlines to

     2           Compuserve in the Ohio newspapers and I'm sure that ruined

     3           their day, don't you think?

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  I think it --

     5                    (Laughter.)

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  I think it -- I think it more than

     7           ruined their day, your Honor.  If you're a commercial on-line

     8           provider and there are headlines around the country saying

     9           you're being investigated or reviewed or whatever the word is

    10           for being a purveyor of pornography to children, you're not

    11           going to sign up a whole lot of new subscribers that day or

    12           for many days to come.  It more than ruined their day.

    13                    The -- I think you're right.  We can't  take --

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I mean that suggests to me, and of

    15           course I'm going to ask our friends on the other side about

    16           this, are they really serious about these defenses?  Because

    17           that material was tagged, it had a warning. 

    18                    MR. ENNIS:  It had a warning and it not only had a

    19           warning, it was within the proprietary service and it said

    20           you can click this button and that material is not available

    21           to any minors in your household.

    22                    So not only was it tagged, not only was it in a

    23           separate directory, it also came packaged with a completely

    24           effective parental control device.  Even so, that matter was

    25           referred on to the FBI.


                    


                                                                            50

     1                    Now, the Government can't seriously argue that

     2           tagging or putting your name in a registry would constitute a

     3           safe harbor defense.  The most they've ever argued in their

     4           brief is that it, quote, "might qualify."

     5                    And the Keeney letter says at most it's substantial

     6           evidence and it's only substantial evidence if the evidence

     7           of tagging is coupled with, quote, "evidence that the

     8           marketplace of browsers are actually screening for that

     9           particular tag."

    10                    There was testimony at trial that that is

    11           technologically impossible today.  It is not technologically

    12           impossible today for speakers to know, to have evidence

    13           whether the marketplace of browsers are actually screening,

    14           so it's an evidence that's totally impossible to provide.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, what -- I find both your

    16           position and the Government's position somewhat inconsistent

    17           internally.  You say you should, you have a better

    18           alternative and that is to have parents do it via Surfwatch

    19           and groups like that and yet you argue that the Government's 

    20           tagging system is not effective, nobody said it's really

    21           working yet.  The Government says its tagging system is the

    22           one that we should use but yours is not working and

    23           effective.

    24                    Now, either there is a potential tagging system for,

    25           workable tagging system for both parties or there isn't.  The


                    


                                                                            51

     1           evidence shows that there was some success by Surfwatch but

     2           minuscule really in the totality of the Internet.

     3                    What is your position as to why your position is not

     4           inconsistent?

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  I understand your question, your Honor. 

     6           It is a complicated question, let me try to explain that.  In

     7           order to explain it, I have to back up a half step.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  And indicate that even if a speaker tags

    10           or puts their -- registers with a registry, all it does is

    11           warn listeners, give them notice of the nature of the speech

    12           so that if they wanted to block the speech and had the

    13           software capacity, they could do so.

    14                    But the Government's experts agree that without the

    15           cooperation of the end user with people down the

    16           communication chain, merely tagging speech or registering it

    17           in a registry does nothing whatsoever to prevent access to

    18           that speech by minors.  In fact, using search engines minors

    19           can more easily gain access to that speech.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Then why do you rely on Surfwatch

    21           and groups like that to say that is a least restrictive

    22           alternative?

    23                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, let me explain that, your Honor. 

    24           What's wrong with the Government's tagging proposal is it is

    25           completely dependent on end users, parental responsibility,


                    


                                                                            52

     1           or it won't shield a single minor from anything.  

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But so is PICs.

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes, yes, it is, but there's a diff--

     4           here's the difference, your Honor.  If the parent is going to

     5           be a responsible parent and is going to take steps to protect

     6           their children, with PICs, the parent can set the PICs

     7           browser so that it will not allow access to any speech on the

     8           Internet unless the speech has been rated as appropriate by a

     9           third-party bureau the parent knows and trusts.

    10                    That would completely protect minors from

    11           inappropriate material without requiring speakers to self-

    12           label or tag their speech at all.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And that's the essential

    14           difference --

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  And that's the essential --

    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- in a nutshell.

    17                    MR. ENNIS:  It is.

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You don't want the speaker to

    19           have to do anything and the Government wants the speaker to

    20           have to make some judgment.

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  That's the point, your Honor. 

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.

    23                    MR. ENNIS:  That is exactly the point because the

    24           Government -- 

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are PICs currently working?


                    


                                                                            53

     1                    MR. ENNIS:  Actually, the press reports yesterday

     2           indicated that two days ago the final PIC standards are out,

     3           it will be working in July.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.  We don't have any, I

     5           think we have to rely on the evidence that was before us.  We

     6           don't have any evidence that PICs is currently working. 

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, we --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, wait a minute, could he

     9           answer my question first?

    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Right.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You can -- go ahead.  And, yeah,

    12           it's directed to him.

    13                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, that's right and that's evidence,

    14           what that means is that PICs isn't working to block the

    15           Government's tags either, so that  there's no safe harbor

    16           today, even if speakers use the Government's L-18 pack.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But didn't Mr. Vesser who's from the

    18           Worldwide Web consortium, didn't he tell us that PICs would

    19           be operational in three to six months?

    20                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes, it will be.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that is in the record. 

    22                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.  Probably in June or July it will

    23           be operational.  There are -- there are --

    24                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Mr. Ennis, let me get back to the

    25           point here, at this point, and then -- it might be the right


                    


                                                                            54

     1           time to get back to it.  You gave a little bit of short

     2           shrift and I'm sure not intentionally to my talking about

     3           burden of proof here.  Burden of proof may not be important,

     4           I'm not sure yet, but isn't the burden of proof always going

     5           to be on the Government in a case like this to prove that the

     6           defendant has not -- the burden's not going to be on the

     7           defendant to prove his safe harbor is effective, it's going

     8           to be on the Government to prove that it's not effective. 

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  I'm afraid not, your Honor.

    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Because it's like a defense of

    11           insanity.  I mean you can arrange a defense of insanity but

    12           the Government has to prove you were sane, you don't have to

    13           prove you were insane. 

    14                    MR. ENNIS:  Well --

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And isn't that the same analogy

    16           here?

    17                    MR. ENNIS:  It's been a long time since I looked at

    18           the insanity defense but my recollection is the Government

    19           has to prove you had the mental intent to commit the crime

    20           but you bear the burden of establishing insanity defense.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, no, well, I don't -- that's 

    22           a -- that isn't really what you and I have here.  I think the

    23           same is true in a consensual defense to rape, for example. 

    24           You may raise that defense but the Government has the burden

    25           of proving it was non-consensual.  You don't have any burden


                    


                                                                            55

     1           to --

     2                    MR. ENNIS:  Well --               

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- to prove it was consensual. 

     4           So I mean in this, so in this --

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor --

     6                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- context of criminal law --

     7                    MR. ENNIS:  Let me say that --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why don't you wait till the rest of

     9           the question, the rest of Judge Buckwalter's question came

    10           out.

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah, I was going to say in the

    12           context of criminal law isn't the burden going to be on the

    13           Government here?  Once the defendant raises the fact of well,

    14           I tried to do this and this is what I did, he doesn't have to

    15           prove that was effective, the Government has to prove that it

    16           was not.

    17                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor, I would hope so.  That's not

    18           my understanding of the Government's position, but it doesn't

    19           matter.

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I'll talk to them about that.

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  It doesn't matter because even if the

    22           burden is on the Government, still the speaker can have no

    23           assurance whatsoever that if they take the steps the

    24           Government suggests they will surely and safely have a safe

    25           harbor, even if the burden is on the Government to prove that


                    


                                                                            56

     1           the steps were not effective rather on them to prove that the

     2           steps were effective, they are still at risk of losing that

     3           battle in front of a jury.  And it could be any jury in any

     4           community in America.

     5                    Therefore, no prudent speaker --

     6                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah, well, now I'm not exactly

     7           sure I know where this burden of proof argument goes in this

     8           whole scheme of things but I did want to discuss it.

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, I think it's a very important

    10           point and the way I would say it is the statute is

    11           unconstitutional, whether the burden is on the Government to

    12           deal with the safe harbor defenses or the burden is on the

    13           speaker.  The unconstitutionality is compounded if the burden

    14           is on the speaker.

    15                    But backing up to Judge Sloviter's question, there

    16           are right now today through all of the major on-line service

    17           providers ways to block access through Compuserve or Prodigy,

    18           for example, to all speech on the Internet that the parents

    19           don't want to come in or on America On Line to block access

    20           to all areas of the Internet except the small areas that

    21           America On Line has prescreened and put in their Kids Only

    22           room as appropriate for children.

    23                    So there are end user capacities for everyone who

    24           uses the on-line service providers to block access to the

    25           Internet today.


                    


                                                                            57

     1                    The point I'm trying to make with this -- the

     2           difference between the Government's proposal and ours is the

     3           act, tagging and registering cannot possibly protect minors

     4           unless parents acquire software that will read the tags and

     5           then turn it on and use it.

     6                    If the parents do that, there is no need for the act

     7           because they can block access to all inappropriate speech

     8           even if no speaker ever self-labeled or rated their speech

     9           and even if there had never been any act at all.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Doesn't Dr. Olsen's proposal, the

    11           minus L-18 proposal have at least one advantage over PICs, as

    12           I understand the testimony?  And that is with his tagging

    13           proposal you could tag the four-letter words in the

    14           Canterbury Tales, let's say, and expurgate the Canterbury

    15           Tales by tagging those words, whereas as I understand PICs,

    16           the best you could do would be to give each page a URL and

    17           delete the whole page that has a four-letter word on it.  Do

    18           I understand the testimony correctly?

    19                    MR. ENNIS:  The testimony was to my mind somewhat

    20           confusing on that point but I think that may be an accurate

    21           recollection of the testimony.  There are some advantages to

    22           the L-18 over PICs and some -- and many advantages to PICs

    23           over L-18.  The principal advantage of L-18 is it's typing in

    24           four key strokes, that's it.  The principal disadvantage of

    25           L-18 is it's a blockbuster, all-or-nothing approach. 


                    


                                                                            58

     1           Everything is either patently offensive or it's okay.

     2                    Whereas with PICs you can say well, this has some

     3           nudity but it's in the context of a serious piece of

     4           literature or --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Even under PICs, for example, we

     6           heard from Mr. Kuromiya and his group.  When PICs becomes

     7           operational doesn't Mr. Kuromiya have a tough call to make

     8           about the critical path information?  Because as I understand

     9           his testimony, he said we want to reach those sexually active

    10           teenagers who are under 18.  So far from having a good faith

    11           defense that I did what I could to prevent it, he's going to

    12           come in and tell the jury:  I want to reach them.  In fact, I

    13           want to pander and titillate them because I need to get their

    14           attention to help save lives.

    15                    So what's he going to do with PICs?

    16                    MR. ENNIS:  I think that your question illustrates

    17           another difference between PICs and the Government's proposal

    18           which is quite important to understand.  PICs primarily

    19           relies upon ratings by third parties that the parent can no

    20           or trust.  In that example perhaps Planned Parenthood would

    21           rate Web sites of material that's sexually explicit but

    22           appropriate for minors.  The parent might trust Planned

    23           Parenthood.  They go to Planned Parenthood and Planned

    24           Parenthood says yes, you can let your child access Kuromiya's

    25           Web site, that's okay, it's good, it's valuable information.


                    


                                                                            59

     1                    The Government's proposal, the parent would have to

     2           know and trust each of the individual millions of speakers on

     3           the Internet.  Why would a parent do that?  Why would a

     4           parent have any reason whatsoever to trust that some

     5           individual speaker they know nothing about is accurately and

     6           appropriately labeling their speech or is inappropriately

     7           labeling their speech?

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why would a parent trust anyone to

     9           do that?  Isn't that a similar indictment of the Surf Watch

    10           et al. argument?

    11                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, a parent certainly could come to

    12           rely upon third-party rating bureaus that the parent has some

    13           knowledge of, for example, the Christian Coalition could have

    14           a rating service that many parents might turn to, the ACLU

    15           might have one, Planned Parenthood might have one.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How feasible are any of these in

    17           light of the evidence in this case of the millions of

    18           communications that go on all the time on the Internet?  And

    19           that's both for the Government's proposal and your proposal.

    20                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, what that comes down to, Judge

    21           Sloviter, is the amount of risk that individual parents are

    22           willing to tolerate with respect to their own children.

    23                    And the advantage of PICs and Surf Watch Manager and

    24           all of the other products we've talked about is they give

    25           parents total control, all the way from zero access to the


                    


                                                                            60

     1           Internet to unrestricted access to the Internet or anything

     2           in between, based upon the parents' judgment of the balance

     3           that's appropriate for their children.

     4                    That's why -- that's another reason why our proposal

     5           is better than the Government's but the most important reason

     6           why it's better, let me get right to that, is that the

     7           Government's proposal, the Government's tagging and

     8           registration proposal will be completely ineffective at

     9           blocking or deterring any of the substantial amount of

    10           sexually explicit speech that is posted abroad.

    11                    By definition the criminal laws of this United --

    12           United States are not going to deter the posting of indecent

    13           or patently offensive material abroad.

    14                    So the Government's tagging system won't work, it

    15           just can't, can't work at all.

    16                    There was testimony by Ann Duvall that at least 30

    17           percent of the sites blocked by Surf Watch are foreign sites. 

    18           There was testimony by Donna Hoffman that at least 40 percent

    19           of all the host computers connected to the Internet are

    20           located abroad and that the percentage of foreign computers,

    21           as a percentage of the total, is rapidly approaching 50

    22           percent.

    23                    There's no reason to think that there's any less

    24           percentage of sexually explicit material posted on foreign

    25           computers than on domestic computers, so it's probable that


                    


                                                                            61

     1           about 50 percent of the sexually explicit material available

     2           on the Internet is posted abroad.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Didn't Dr. Olsen or Mr. Schmidt, I

     4           forget who, say well, that's all true, but if we have the

     5           tagging we can concentrate all of our energy on the offshore

     6           content and so we've reduced our problem by, to take your

     7           figures, half.

     8                    MR. ENNIS:  But it just doesn't, it makes no sense

     9           at all.  If they have the tagging but parents are not using

    10           the blocking software, the tagging does nothing.  If the

    11           parents are using the blocking software you don't need the

    12           tagging to keep all of that speech away from children. In

    13           fact, it's only with the use of the end user software that

    14           you can block access to the foreign material as well.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But on the PICs proposal there was a

    16           lot of discussion in the testimony and in your questions and

    17           in the briefing about differing communities and differing

    18           communities having different standards of indecency, let's

    19           say.  I don't see how PICs deals with that because PICs is

    20           still an all or -- or tagging for that matter, they're still

    21           all or nothing.

    22                    The example I gave of Brainerd, Minnesota versus New

    23           York City, okay, which I think most people would agree are

    24           rather different communities, PICs would either block both

    25           places or not block both places, same thing with tagging,


                    


                                                                            62

     1           right?  So you don't deal with the community issue with PICs.

     2                    MR. ENNIS:  That raises the fundamental question

     3           with this law because the law makes it a crime to make speech

     4           available in a way that's available to minors.  And if a

     5           parent isn't using PICs  or Surf Watch, that speech will be

     6           available in all those communities you talked about.  That's

     7           the fundamental problem with the law.

     8                    If Congress had thought about this, they might have

     9           tried to come up with a much more sensible law that could

    10           have done many things.  For example, it could have encouraged

    11           the development of these end-user software products.  

    12                    One of the real problems with this law, in my

    13           opinion, is that it gives the wrong signal to parents.  I

    14           think it gives a signal to parents that the Federal

    15           Government has stepped in and taken care of the problem of

    16           inappropriate material on the Internet, so parents don't need

    17           to worry.  

    18                    In fact, parents do need to worry.  Even with the

    19           Government's tagging proposal, if parents don't go to the

    20           trouble of acquiring and using parental software devices, all

    21           of that material will be available to their children despite

    22           this act.  That's one thing I hope can come out of the

    23           publicity surrounding this case is that parents will learn

    24           that they do have available to them very effective parental

    25           control devices, but they have to use them.


                    


                                                                            63

     1                    This act has not taken care of the problem and if

     2           the parents don't use those devices, all the sexually

     3           explicit speech on the Internet will be available in every

     4           home in America that's connected to the Internet, despite the

     5           act.

     6                    Let me briefly say, there were some questions about

     7           facial challenge, in earlier briefs the Government seemed to

     8           take the position that we could not bring a facial challenge. 

     9           But if you look at Pages 14 through 17 of the Government's

    10           post hearing brief, the Government acknowledges that we can

    11           bring a facial challenge in at least two ways.  We're

    12           bringing a vagueness challenge and we're alleging that the

    13           act is vague in all applications, so that's appropriate as a

    14           facial challenge.

    15                    More to this point, the Government now acknowledges

    16           that we can bring a substantial over-breadth facial challenge

    17           and we have standing to do that, all we have to show is that

    18           the law is substantially over-broad.

    19                    And in answer to the question from your Honors, the

    20           two cases that discuss that are Shomburg and City of Houston,

    21           both of which say that a law is over-broad if a substantial

    22           number of its applications would be unconstitutional.

    23                    What I think we have shown is that Subsection D is

    24           substantially over-broad because in every one of its

    25           applications except for commercial speakers, it bans speech


                    


                                                                            64

     1           that is constitutionally protected for adults.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why do you keep ignoring Subsection

     3           A which I think you also challenge?

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, we do challenge it, your Honor. 

     5           We're not ignoring it, it's just that the --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you keep focusing on

     7           Subsection D.

     8                    MR. ENNIS:  That's right.  That's because Subsection

     9           D is the section that will affect most Internet speakers,

    10           those who want to make their speech broadly available to the

    11           world.

    12                    Subsection A is a more focused law about speakers

    13           who want to make their speech available to a much more tiny

    14           segment of the world.  We do challenge both, but the truly

    15           draconian and sweeping provision of this law is Subsection D.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  If the Government though -- and I

    17           intend to ask Mr. Coppolino about this -- the Government does

    18           say in Footnote 46 of their brief, Page 37, I think, that

    19           they have, quote, "concerns," close quote, about your

    20           standing because they argue that your worries are so far

    21           fetched, so hyperbolic as to raise these, quote, "concerns,"

    22           close quote, about your standing.  Do you want to address

    23           that?

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, first of all, I think the

    25           Government is simply wrong about that, I think our concerns


                    


                                                                            65

     1           about our standing are not at all hyperbolic or far-fetched

     2           as the Compuserve incident from just two days ago would make

     3           painfully clear.

     4                    This is a law which, if you look at the text and at

     5           the conference report, makes clear it criminalizes the

     6           display of patently offensive speech that is not obscene and

     7           the law makes clear that that speech is criminalized even if

     8           it has serious value.

     9                    Therefore, all of our speakers who engage in speech

    10           that does have serious value are at risk of prosecution under

    11           this law.

    12                    Also, under the over-breadth doctrine, pure over-

    13           breadth doctrine, we would have standing under Fox to bring

    14           this challenge on behalf of those speakers whose speech did

    15           not have serious value.  So either way you look at it, I

    16           think there's no standing issue in this case.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, it's certainly true that the

    18           Government has said consistently that -- and of course it

    19           never filed a motion as to standing and it was assured to me

    20           when we were talking about the stipulations that the

    21           Government had no standing concerns, but that Footnote 46

    22           raised my eyebrows a little bit and that's why I raised it

    23           with you.

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, let me make a footnote point to

    25           that is that not only have we brought an extraordinarily


                    


                                                                            66

     1           broad coalition of plaintiff groups representing truly

     2           virtually all of the mainstream media publication and

     3           computer entities in America.  Those groups have sued also on

     4           behalf of their patrons, their subscribers and their users. 

     5           The librarians are also suing on behalf of their patrons and

     6           members.  America On Line is suing on behalf of its

     7           subscribers.

     8                    So we're suing on behalf of millions of speakers on

     9           the Internet.  Many of those speakers speak to news groups,

    10           list serves, IRC chat rooms, and it's quite likely that some

    11           of the speech they engage in would not have serious value

    12           under the Government's definition. 

    13                    So we're also speaking on behalf, we're bringing

    14           this suit on behalf of speech that does not have serious

    15           value.  Accordingly, we have standing for that third reason

    16           as well.

    17                    I'd like, if I could, to make one final point and

    18           then reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think you've used most of your

    20           time, but go ahead.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you've reserved 15 minutes for

    22           rebuttal. 

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But we'll see -- we'll hear you on

    24           rebuttal.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you ten, right.


                    


                                                                            67

     1                    MR. ENNIS:  Do I still have some time left?

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you have five minutes.

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  Let me make one brief point.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And a substantial amount of your

     5           initial time.

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.  The Government suggests that the

     7           act should not be struck down because the act in combination

     8           with user blocking software would be more effective than

     9           either alone.  There are several problems with that argument. 

    10           First, as I think we have shown, this act does nothing,

    11           literally nothing or at most only a marginal amount to

    12           protect children from inappropriate speech that would not

    13           already be done as a result of market forces and end user

    14           software even in the absence of the act.  And that marginal

    15           benefit comes at the expense of suppressing constitutionally

    16           protected speech for adults.  So the act violates --

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That implicates a factual issue as

    18           to how frequently one might -- well, a child is likely to

    19           inadvertently find speech that was intended to be suppressed

    20           by this statute.

    21                    What is your understanding of, given all the

    22           evidence that we saw here, of the frequency of what the facts

    23           show as to the frequency of an inadvertent coming across

    24           that--

    25                    MR. ENNIS:  I think the evidence on that is clear


                    


                                                                            68

     1           and I think Congress agreed.  The Government's expert, Howard

     2           Schmidt, testified in court that, quote, "The odds are slim

     3           that someone would come across a sexually explicit site by

     4           accident."

     5                    Congress in fact found in the act in one of its

     6           findings that the interactive computer services, as the name

     7           suggests, the word interactive, "offer users a great deal of

     8           control over the information that they receive as well as the

     9           potential for even greater control in the future as

    10           technology develops."

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, now we saw a few examples

    12           presented by the Government's witnesses where that was

    13           likely.  What I have yet to see is somebody testify as to

    14           how, beside the very slim, how frequently that could occur

    15           because obviously it can occur.

    16                    MR. ENNIS:  It obviously can occur and --

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We saw it in the Jasmine example.

    18                    MR. ENNIS:  Yeah, it obviously can occur.  We don't

    19           take the position that it is impossible to be surprised by

    20           what comes up on your computer screen.

    21                    We do take the position and have all testified to

    22           this effect, Bill Burrington testified to this effect, that

    23           in interactive computer services, unlike broadcast TV or

    24           radio, the speaker, I mean the listener makes an affirmative

    25           choice of where they are going to go and they have to select


                    


                                                                            69

     1           where they're going to go.

     2                    You don't turn on your computer and sexually

     3           explicit images pop on your screen.  You turn on your

     4           computer and you have to select where you want to go to get

     5           there.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is the Government entitled to

     7           prevent a child who wants to go into sexually active material

     8           from being able to do so?

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  Regardless of the parents' wishes?

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mm-hmm.

    11                    MR. ENNIS:  I think that's a very difficult

    12           question, your Honor.  I think as a constitutional matter if

    13           Congress wanted to have as an interest and to exercise a

    14           parents' patri interest in protecting child-- minors from

    15           access to material, even if their parents thought it was

    16           appropriate for their children, it could conceivably have

    17           such an interest.  It would raise very serious constitutional

    18           questions in my mind, some of which are noted in the fabulous

    19           opinion by your Honor.

    20                    But the important point here is, is that Congress

    21           has given us no reason whatsoever to think that that is the

    22           interest underlying this act.  To the contrary, in this act

    23           Congress found as a fact that its objective in the text of

    24           the act was, quote, "To empower parents to restrict their

    25           children's access to objectionable or inappropriate on-line


                    


                                                                            70

     1           material" and the conference report is even clearer.

     2                    The conference report confirms, quote, "The

     3           important Federal policy of empowering parents to determine

     4           the content of communications their children receive."

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Isn't there evidence on the record

     6           that there are a great number of possibilities for people

     7           under 18 to access the Internet outside of the home?  There

     8           are lots -- there's lots of evidence --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Internet cafes.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, but even if little children

    11           don't go to cafes --

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Libraries.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- at libraries, et cetera,

    14           schools.

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  Schools.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, and where -- and you also

    17           assume in your argument and in your brief very knowledgeable

    18           parents, parents who know how to, assuming they have a

    19           computer in the house, who will know how to contact the

    20           entities that will be able to help them in putting things

    21           like Surfwatch on.  

    22                    And I'm not sure how realistic that is in today's

    23           world.  I mean we have children who don't know about birth

    24           control, who aren't told by their parents about AIDS, because

    25           we have a whole substrata of our society in which parents are


                    


                                                                            71

     1           unwilling or unable to give this information.  So how can you

     2           make the assumption that we can rely on parents for this kind

     3           of protection?

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  Well --

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And do we have to?

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Two responses, your Honor.  Your final

     7           question is yes, we do have to.  If parents do not act

     8           responsibly, if parents don't do what they can do, nothing in

     9           this act will protect children from inappropriate material,

    10           nothing.

    11                    But the two answers I'd like to give are first, I

    12           respectfully disagree with your Honor.  I think the testimony

    13           by Ann Duvall, the testimony by Bill Burrington was clear

    14           that it is very easy for parents to use the parental control

    15           devices like Surfwatch, Surfwatch Manager, the America On

    16           Line Compuserve Project Parental Control devices, it's really

    17           quite easy.  Any parent that has a computer can almost

    18           certainly use those devices.

    19                    Second, if parents can't figure out how to use those

    20           devices then that is a problem for the Government as well

    21           because the Government's whole idea about tagging or

    22           registering speech can't work unless the parents have the

    23           capacity to use that end-user software.  So if it's a

    24           problem, it's a problem for the act, not a problem for our

    25           case.


                    


                                                                            72

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Last question, the same question I

     2           asked Mr. Hansen.  Senator Exon and Senator Coates give you

     3           the pen to write child of CDA, do you give it back to them or

     4           do you write something?

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, my first answer would be exactly

     6           what Mr. Hansen answered, wait a decent interval, let the

     7           marketplace work, especially since Congress made findings of

     8           fact that it wanted to preserve a vibrant, free market in the

     9           Internet, quote, "unfettered by Government regulation."  Let

    10           the market work for a while and see if you even need any

    11           governmental intervention of this nature whatsoever.

    12                    But if I were pushed to try to come up with a

    13           different law I think there are many things Congress could

    14           have considered that would have narrowed the scope of the

    15           law, in answer to Judge Sloviter's question, without even

    16           thinking about the affirmative safe harbor defenses.

    17                    If Congress was truly concerned about commercial

    18           pornography it could have written a much narrower law that

    19           only criminalized the display to minors of truly sexually

    20           explicit material. 

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But those laws already exist.

    22                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, for obscenity it does, but they

    23           could have gone down one notch and tried that.  They could

    24           have made clear that speech with serious value is not

    25           criminalized, they could have done that.


                    


                                                                            73

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So you disagree with what Mr. Hansen

     2           said about the medium specific aspect here?

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  Oh, no, no, no, not at all.  The reason

     4           that this very broad coalition of plaintiff groups is before

     5           the Court today is precisely to emphasize the point that this

     6           medium of communication truly is unlike any other that has

     7           ever gone before it and that the appropriate First Amendment

     8           standards of review that this Court must develop to govern

     9           regulation of this new medium of communication have to take

    10           those characteristics into consideration.

    11                    One of the principal characteristics is it is a

    12           truly global medium, which Congress forgot about it.  It is

    13           not as if patently offensive speech that's posted abroad has

    14           to come through a Customs Office checkpoint before it reaches

    15           American homes where it can be physically screened by Customs

    16           officers.  Everything that's posted abroad is instantly

    17           available in every home in America, this is a global

    18           communications medium.

    19                    I can suggest a few other ways of narrowing the

    20           statute that Congress could have considered.  For example,

    21           the Government has made much in its evidence about the so-

    22           called teaser ads by commercial providers of sexually

    23           explicit speech who have teaser ads and then charge with

    24           credit cards to actually get into their Web sites.

    25                    If that was really Congress' concern, Congress could


                    


                                                                            74

     1           have crafted a much different statute designed to regulate

     2           advertising.  Now, in my opinion there would be very, very

     3           serious constitutional problems with regulation of

     4           advertising on the Internet, but they would be of a different

     5           order of magnitude because they would be judged under the

     6           intermediate standard of review, not under strict scrutiny

     7           because commercial speech is judged on an intermediate

     8           standard of review.  That's another narrower thing Congress

     9           could have done.

    10                    There are many ways Congress could have narrowed

    11           this law, the most important of which would be to take out

    12           the word speech available to minors.  That basically bans all

    13           speech.  Congress could have said, passed a law that said

    14           before you engage in patently offensive speech on the

    15           Internet you should give fair warning that your speech is

    16           patently offensive.  Then all these tagging defenses would

    17           make some sense because you would be giving fair warning. 

    18           That's a different scheme that Congress, I think probably

    19           would be an unconstitutional scheme, but it would certainly

    20           be a narrower scheme than the one Congress adopted.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It doesn't help to suggest what you

    22           think is unconstitutional now, does it?

    23                    (Laughter.)

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  I was just trying to respond to Judge

    25           Dalzell's question.  If I were --


                    


                                                                            75

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The answer may be -- I mean if you

     2           really think it -- that there's nothing that Congress could

     3           have done constitutionally.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's okay to say that, Mr. Ennis.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean I'm not sure that's right --

     6                    (Laughter.)

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- but I can't see how it helps us

     8           to suggest statutes that you would later challenge.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because for sure you wouldn't want

    10           to repeat what's happened with dial-a-porn, would you?  That

    11           is to say where you have ten years of litigation over the

    12           subject?

    13                    MR. ENNIS:  No, I think that's right and I think

    14           that's precisely why Congress specifically authorized a

    15           facial challenge in this case because there's allegedly

    16           history makes clear that Congress did not want to wait for

    17           ten years to find out whether they've got a valid law or not.

    18                    And if it's limited to an as-applied challenge, then

    19           you're into years of litigation about the constitutional

    20           scope of the law.  That's why I think Congress invited a

    21           broad facial challenge to this law.

    22                    Let me finish the point I said was the final point I

    23           was going to make about this combination.  The Government's

    24           argument that the less drastic alternative of end-user

    25           software coupled with the act would be more effective than


                    


                                                                            76

     1           either alone.  That argument is flatly inconsistent with

     2           current law and would basically wipe out the less restrictive

     3           alternative requirement of strict scrutiny because it is

     4           almost always the case that a combination of the Government

     5           prohibition and the less restrictive alternative together

     6           would be more effective than either alone.

     7                    In the Bolger case, for example, the combination of

     8           the Government prohibition on unsolicited mailings when

     9           combined with the less drastic alternative of parental

    10           supervision of incoming mails would surely be more effective

    11           than either alone, but the Supreme Court struck down that

    12           governmental prohibition and relied exclusively and solely on

    13           parental supervision of what their children would receive in

    14           the mail.  That's the appropriate response for this case as

    15           well.

    16                    Thank you.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, we will -- go ahead.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We will recess for 15 minutes,

    19           please.

    20                    (Court in recess; 11:07 to 11:28 o'clock a.m.)
