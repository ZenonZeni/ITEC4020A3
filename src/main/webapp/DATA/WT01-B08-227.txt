</I></FONT><IMG SRC="rainbwln.gif" height=13 width=550></CENTER><br>Defense Industrial Capability Assessments:</B> </font><font size=3> Historically, the majority of the Bureau of Export Administration's (BXA) research studies have been defense industrial capability assessments.  Assessments have been published on such industries as gears, precision optics, robotics, and semiconductor wafer processing equipment, among others, as well as a detailed foreign dependency assessment of three U.S. Navy weapon systems.  Most of these studies were conducted at the request of the Defense Department's secretariat or one of its service branches.  Industrial capability assessments have been published on the following industries; click on any title to read a brief <a name="index1"></A>summary:<P></font><font size=2><img src="lightblu.gif"> <A HREF="#index2"><B>Small Explosives (CAD/PADs) Industry</B></A>  (September 1995)<BR><img src="lightblu.gif"> <A HREF="#index3"><B>Beryllium </B></A> (July 1993)<BR><img src="lightblu.gif"> <A HREF="#index4"><B>Antifriction Bearings</B></A>  (February 1993) <BR><img src="lightblu.gif"> <A HREF="#index5"><B>Forgings</B></A>  (December 1992)<BR><img src="lightblu.gif"> <A HREF="#index6"><B>The Domestic and Foreign Subcontractor Base: Three U.S. Navy Weapon Systems</I></B></A> (March 1992)<p></font><font size=3>You can order BXA critical technology assessments at the Commerce Department's National Technical Information Service (NTIS) by calling the NTIS Sales Desk at <B>703-487-4650</B> or the Rush Order Desk at <B>1-800-553-NTIS</B>.

CAD/PADs are explosive devices used predominantly in weapon systems, performing such functions as aircrew ejection in emergencies, flare ejection, and bomb and missile releases, but also have a growing use in commercial applications, such as automobile airbags, emergency cutting tools, and fire extinguisher actuators.  This assessment was undertaken at the request of the U.S. Navy's Naval Surface Warfare Center in Indian Head, Maryland.  The Navy initiated the study out of concern for the long-term survival of the firms that supply these products. <P> The assessment found a one-third drop in the number of suppliers, a shrinking defense sector and a growing commercial sector, and that the small suppliers, who were most likely to rely on defense endmarkets, were in the worst financial condition.  The study recommended that the Navy initiate bi-annual meetings with industry to build a closer working relationship with the remaining firms, to give information about the potential future demand, and to better understand the problems of industry.  It was also suggested that the facility in Indian Head, MD, be used as a pre-shipping test facility, to help alleviate the delays that were uncovered in the study.  Finally, the Commerce Department also introduced the remaining CAD/PAD firms to a potential new market, Department of Justice law enforcement programs, which will allow these firms to maintain defense capabilities while exploring other markets.  <P></font><font size=2><A HREF="#index"><B><I>Return to top of page</A><br><A HREF="#index1">Return to selections</I></B></A> for ordering information<A NAME="index3"></A><P><HR></font><font size=3><center><B>National Security Assessment of the U.S. Beryllium Industry </B><BR></font><font size=2>(PB 93-192458) July 1993 - Price $95<P></font><font size=3></center>This report was conducted at the request of the Department of the Navy.  The Navy sought to determine the percentage of scrap generated by defense contractors' beryllium operations, as well as the procedures for recycling this scrap.  The scope of the study was expanded to include:  other key beryllium products; a review of economic and trade factors; and how global developments in the former Soviet Union may affect the viability of the U.S. beryllium sector.  <P>This assessment found that the importance of beryllium to the defense industrial base lies in its unique properties.  These properties enable beryllium to play a central role in our national defense, and have contributed greatly to advances in electronics, optics and telecommunications.  The report notes that the United States is by far the world's largest producer, processor and consumer of beryllium related products.  The report concluded that the long-term health of the beryllium sector is uncertain. Environmental costs continue to rise faster than revenues, and at margin continue to constrain the market potential of beryllium, at both the manufacturing point and among potential customers.  The potential for a surge in supply of beryllium on the world market from Kazakstan has increased.  Finally, concerns about the sale of beryllium copper master alloy from the National Defense Stockpile were expressed because of potentially disruptive effects the sale could have on the domestic industry.  <P></font><font size=2><A HREF="#index"><B><I>Return to top of page</A><br><A HREF="#index1">Return to selections</I></B></A> for ordering information<A NAME="index4"></A><P><HR></font><font size=3><center><B>National Security Assessment of the Anti-Friction Bearings Industry</B><BR></font><font size=2>(PB 93-154474) February 1993 - Price $95<P></center></font><font size=3>Conducted at the request of the Department of Defense, this report analyzed the impact of the Pentagon's "Buy America" restriction on bearings, reports on the industry's international competitiveness and the growing presence of foreign-owned firms in the U.S. market, and provides comprehensive trade and other economic data benchmarked against trends in the wider economy. <P>The report found that the "Buy America" guidelines had a positive impact on the industry and U.S. national security, and concluded that removing the restriction at this time would have a particularly negative impact on the high-technology superprecision bearing sector.  This study demonstrated that the defense-intensive U.S. superprecision bearing sector was most important to national security.  The superprecision sector's viability was threatened, however, by decreasing defense budgets, worldwide overcapacity, and the reported difficulty to access foreign markets, particularly Japan. <P></font><font size=2><A HREF="#index"><B><I>Return to top of page</A><br><A HREF="#index1">Return to selections</I></B></A> for ordering information<A NAME="index5"></A><P></font><font size=3><HR><center><B>National Security Assessment of the U.S. Forging Industry</B><BR></font><font size=2>(PB 93-183721) December 1992 - Price $95<P></center></font><font size=3><P>The Department of Commerce conducted this report at the request of the Department of Defense to determine if "Buy America" restrictions limiting military procurement of certain forgings was still necessary.  The result was a comprehensive assessment of policy options available to maintain defense industrial capabilities in an era of decreasing resources.  The report was created following a mandatory survey of the domestic industry. This study demonstrated how the viability of an archetypical defense-intensive heavy manufacturing industry is influenced by the decline of its domestic endmarkets, high import penetration, encroaching alternative technologies, and lagging investment and profitability. <P> The study notes that removal of Defense "Buy America" restrictions could jeopardize companies' financial health and/or lead some remaining domestic forging suppliers to exit the defense market.  In addition, the study recommends making maximum use of the Department of Defense's MANTECH Programs to assist forging defense suppliers in modernizing.  The study also suggested encouraging the forging sector to consolidate into larger, more technically efficient firms.<P></font><font size=2><A HREF="#index"><B><I>Return to top of page</A><br><A HREF="#index1">Return to selections</I></B></A> for ordering information<A NAME="index6"></A><P></font><font size=3><HR><center><B>National Security Assessment of the Domestic and Foreign Subcontractor Base<br>A study of Three U.S. Navy Weapons Systems<BR></B></font><font size=2>(PB 93-183739) March 1992 - Price $95<P></center></font><font size=3>Conducted at the request of the Department of the Navy, this report assessed the extent to which the U.S. Navy relies on foreign suppliers for critical components for its weapon systems.  Three representative systems were chosen for analysis:  the HARM missile; the Mark-48 ADCAP torpedo; and the Verdin communications system.  The study focused on subtier suppliers, the first known study of its kind to do so.  Almost 12,000 companies participated in the project.  The study found that the supply matrix is not pyramid-shaped as expected but is in fact diamond-shaped, indicating that there is a core group of subtier firms unknown to the Navy that could serve as bottlenecks during a surge in production.  Foreign-sourcing was found to increase at the lower tiers of supply but was much lower in general than expected. The number of dependencies were low as well, although there were a total of 115 distinct items reported as dependencies across all tiers and weapon systems.  These items varied from raw materials like nickel and chromium to high-tech value-added items such as semiconductor ceramic packaging and needle roller bearing wire rod.<P></font><font size=2><A HREF="#index"><B><I>Return to top of page</A><br><A HREF="#index1">Return to selections</I></B></A> for ordering information<P></font><font size=1><P><center><IMG SRC="rainbwln.gif" height=13 width=550><P><CENTER><A HREF="sec232.htm"><B><I>Section 232 Investigations</B></I> <img src="btn_prev.gif"></A><A HREF="http://207.96.70.148"><img src="btn_home.gif"></A><A HREF="econanal.htm"><img src="btn_next.gif"><B><I>Economic Analysis</B></I></A><P></CENTER></font></body></html>
