<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 219</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>The Cairo Compact on climate 
change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The 1989 Cairo Compact called for urgent international action on the threat of 
climate change. </B>In December 1989 the Egyptian government, the United Nations 
Environment Programme UNEP), and the Climate Institute convened a World Conference 
on Preparing for Climate Change. Held in Cairo and attended by over 400 participants 
from all regions of the world, the conference adopted the Cairo Compact.1<B> </B>The 
Compact states that climate change requires the cooperation of all nations on an 
unprecedented scale. To be effective, any measures would have to be supported not only 
by governments, but by multilateral organizations, the industrial and financial community, 
scientific and educational institutions, and environmental groups. Individuals may also 
make an important contribution through their consumption patterns and participation in 
the decision-making process. The Compact concludes by underlining the urgency of these 
actions: "For the sake of our planet and the lives of our children and generations to come, 
we must act now."<P>
<B>The Compact outlines the key issues that should be at the top of the world 
agenda. </B>They include:<P>
	<B><I>The elaboration of a framework climate treaty</B></I> in time for adoption 
by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development UNCED). <A 
HREF = "fs209.html">Work on such a treaty</A> should 
build on concepts already developed by international organizations and conferences, 
such as <A HREF = "fs218.html">the Noordwijk Ministerial 
Conference</A> of November 1989. The convention should set general targets for 
greenhouse gas emissions and reforestation. More specific commitments should be 
contained in protocols.<P>
	<B><I>Governments should give strong support to the work of the 
Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC).</B></I> All nations should 
become parties to <A HREF = "fs224.html">the Montreal 
Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer</A>. Existing UN bodies such as 
UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization WMO) should be strengthened. (See 
fact sheets 206, 208 and 224.)<P>
	While participating in the development of an international treaty, <B><I>governments 
should take their own measures at the national and regional  levels</B></I>. These 
measures could then serve as a basis for international regulations. <P>
	<B><I>Wealthy nations should provide developing countries with the means to cope 
with climate change</B></I>.<P>
	International and national measures should focus on efforts to <B><I>reduce the 
"historically unprecedented population growth" which is "a driving force behind the 
increase in greenhouse gas emissions."</B></I> Other important efforts include 
curbing deforestation, promoting reforestation, saving energy through more efficient 
industrial processes and transport systems, and using  renewable sources of energy. <P>
	<B><I>As a certain degree of climate change is inevitable, the necessary adaptation 
measures have to be taken.</B></I> The resilience of agriculture under conditions of 
climate change must be increased. <A HREF = 
"fs203.html">Island and coastal states</A> should include the 
prospective <A HREF = "fs102.html">sea-level rise</A> in 
their long-term planning. Since climate change may lead to displacement of human 
populations, sufficient means are needed to cope with the problem of <A HREF = 
"fs112.html">environmental refugees</A>.<P>
