<IMG SRC="HUNGRY.gif" ALIGN="right"><A NAME="rose"><H2>WHAT DO <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/rose.htm">ROSES</A> LIKE?</H2>
<B><P>Many would have you believe that growing <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/rose.htm">roses</A> is the biggest challenge and most mysterious process that gardeners face. Secret formulas for 
<A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">fertilizers</A> and other concoctions abound. Every ardent rose grower has his or her own theory on just the right method to grow roses. Indeed, it seems that few groups of plant enthusiasts are as headstrong as are rosarians. In reality, growing roses is much easier than many might suspect.</P>
<P>Before you select a spot to plant a rose, it is important to have a general sense of what roses like. Few things can have as great an impact on successful rose growing as finding the best location for the rose bush.<P>
<P>Roses need and thrive in sunlight. Ideally they should be planted in an area that receives a minimum of six hours of sunlight a day. David Austin in his book "Old Roses and English Roses" goes so far as to say, "They do not like shade, even partial shade" Perhaps the best suggestion comes from Graham Stuart Thomas in his classic work "The Rose Book." He suggests that the best results particularly in very hot areas will come from planting roses where "their roots are shaded and their flowers are in full sun."
The second most important consideration for growing beautiful roses is the soil they are planted in. Roses prefer and thrive in a rich, slightly acid soil that is well drained. If you have a poorly drained <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/soil.htm>soil</A> consider planting in raised beds to help improve drainage and aeration. It is also advisable to plant roses in an area that is free from competition from tree roots and other plants. While many older roses make an outstanding addition to the mixed border it is important to ensure that they will be free of competition from their neighbors until well established in their new homes.</P>

<P>There are few flowers that capture the attention of both gardeners and novices like the rose does.
Immortalized by Shakespeare, cultivated for centuries, intensely hybridized and bred, the rose occupies the center point of many a garden. Rare are those who fail to fall under the spell of the enchanting fragrance or impeccable beauty of the rose. And few topics engender as much debate and opinion like the cultivation and care of roses. We also have our opinions here at the Dirt, and what follows is our own version of "How to Plant A Rose."
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="soil"><H2>PREPARING THE SOIL</H2>
<P>More than many other plants, roses will benefit from careful preparation of the <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">soil</A> before planting. All too often, planting instructions focus on the planting hole. We take a slightly different approach and encourage gardeners to think instead of the area you will be planting your rosebush in. Rather than preparing a rich hole to plant your rose in, we suggest that you amend the area and then dig the hole for planting.</P>
<P>Most roses will grow in an area roughly three foot by three foot, or four by four. Begin by spreading one to three inches of a good quality compost, like our 
<A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Uncle Malcolm's Planting Mix or Mushroom Compost</A> over the area. David Austin considers the addition of <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/compost.htm">compost</A> or humus "crucial in growing good roses." If you live in an area with very acid soils, you could add lime at this point, or if you are in an area with alkaline soils, soil sulfur or peat moss could be used to help acidify the soil. Spread <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/rose.htm">Whitney Farms Rose and Flower Food</A> over the area at the same time. Unlike many synthetic blends, there is no danger of burning tender roots with our <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">fertilizers.</A> They can be used safely at the time of planting.
Thoroughly work all of this into the soil. Graham Stuart Thomas recommends digging as deeply as possible "up to 18 inches" as long as "undesirable subsoil is not brought to the surface."  Indeed, he suggests that the poorer the soil, the more extensive and thorough the preparation should be. At the very least a spade's digging depth is recommended. By preparing the soil for planting in this way we have accomplished two very important things. First, we have loosened the soil around the hole so the roots can grow quickly into the surrounding soil. Second, we have already amended the soil that will go back into the hole. One word of caution:  Do not work the soil when it is wet. <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/dirt/issue1.htm">(See our first issue for an explanation of how to tell if your soil is safe to work.)</A></P>
<P>Meanwhile, soak your bare-root roses in <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/water.htm">water</A> for an hour or two. This is particularly important if the roots may have dried in shipping or storage at the nursery.</P>
<P>Next dig the hole. Be sure it is wide enough to easily take in the roots of the plant. Eighteen inches is usually sufficient for most plants. Save the soil from the hole. Mix a handful of compost with some more <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/rose.htm">Rose & Flower Food</A>, or a handful of <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Bone Meal</A>, into the soil in the bottom of the hole. If you are planting a bare root rose, form a cone of soil in the hole and gently spread the roots over the cone. Be sure to keep the plants' bud union (the knob from which the canes grow) just above the soil surface. A small stick or board can be helpful to check the level of the bud union. In colder climates you can plant the rose with the bud union just below the surface.</P>
<P>At this point, return the soil to the hole. When the hole is half full, give the bush a light shake to help settle the soil around the roots and then carefully firm the soil around the  plant with your feet. Be careful not to tread too heavily. The soil should be firm enough to hold the plant, but not compacted. (Remember all the digging we did to loosen the soil for the roots to grow in!) Finish filling the hole with the remainder of the soil and then firm the soil again.</P>
<P>The last step is to water the rose into the soil. This helps to ensure contact between the soil and the roots and to flush air out from around the roots.</P>
<P>If you are planting a rose from a container, the steps are essentially the same, except that rather than forming a mound, refill the hole with enough soil that the bud union is jut above the soil surface. flatten the soil in the hole and position the rose in the center. Backfill as outlined above.</P>

<H2>CARING FOR YOUR NEW ROSES</H2>
<P>Everyone has a personal theory on the care and feeding of roses. here at the Dirt, we are no different. Because he is long famous for the cultivation of roses, we turn to the suggestions of the English expert David Austin. He claimed that the most important aspect of good rose care is probably mulching. Roses like a cool, rich, moist soil. Mulching helps to provide the right soil conditions for your roses, and makes continuous flowering possible. It helps to conserve moisture in the soil, as well as to suppress weeds. Mulching provides nutrients as well, reduces the susceptibility to some fungal diseases like black spot, and will help to keep the soil loose and friable. In fact, if you are growing roses in hot climates, one trick is to mulch early in the season before the soil warms. up. This helps to keep the soil cooler longer, encouraging your roses to thrive. Look for our <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Garden Mulch or Mushroom Compost</A> at your favorite garden center. Mushroom compost is particularly well suited for use around roses as it is rich in potash, which roses like in abundance. However, if you live in areas with alkaline soils, we would discourage the use of mushroom compost.</P>
<P>Because roses are heavy feeders, good nutrition is important too. We admit an obvious bias, but with good reason. Recently, a number of experts, (officers of regional rose societies) have been critical of organic fertilizers for a variety of reasons, including what they perceive as low nutrient content or high price. Often this only serves to illustrate how little most people know about soil fertility and how little they understand about organic fertilizers.</P>
<P>Keep in mind that high analysis fertilizers like 16-16-16 are often made from very soluble nutrient sources. This means that they will be subject to leaching from the soil during periods of heavy irrigation or rainfall. In fact, many soil scientists estimate that as little as 10 to 20 percent of the synthetic nitrogen fed to plants actually ends up in the plant. Suddenly that super rich triple 16 becomes a 1.6% or at best a 3.2% fertilizer, and that much less of a bargain. By comparison, natural  organic fertilizers like our <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/rose.htm">Rose & Flower Food (4-6-2)</A> are derived from nutrient sources that by definition are not water soluble and release their nutrients slowly over a long period of time. Unlike synthetic nitrogen sources, repeated use of  <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/garden.htm">organic sources</A> can actually result in a reserve of nutrients building up over time, and can be used less often. In our mind, this offers the gardener a much better value.</P>
<P>What is important is that your roses get a good feeding in early spring as they begin to show signs of new growth, again after the first blossoms fade, and finally one more feeding in midsummer. By using organic fertilizers and mulching, we are confident that your roses will be as beautiful as any in the neighborhood, with less work! How do we know? That is what our many
satisfied customers have been telling us for years!</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Alfalfa Meal</A> is great for roses and is an ingredient in our rose food. the January 1993 issue of the American Rose Society Magazine recommended alfalfa meal for stronger stems and greener leaves. Rich in natural growth stimulants, use it according to directions‹more is not better, and can actually suppress growth.</P>
<P>Similarly, kelp meal, another ingredient of our fertilizer, can help increase disease resistance and provides a source of trace minerals. One rose grower had outstanding results when we added <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Greensand</A> to his rose beds last spring. Chris Pruitt of Weeks Roses told us that he was amazed by the results he had when he used Greensand last year.</P>
<P>For those of you who prefer foliar feedings, look for our <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Ellie's Ultimate Plant Food</A>, a unique blend of hydrolized liquid fish and kelp meal. One reader of the American Rose Society Magazine also reported great results mulching roses with our Chicken Manure, but keep in mind that chicken manure is loaded with readily available nitrogen and could burn if over-applied. Generally, we would only recommend it for use around established roses and not for use when planting new roses.</P>
