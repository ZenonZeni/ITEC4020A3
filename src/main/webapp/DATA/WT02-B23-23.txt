 <H1><P ALIGN=CENTER>Welfare Reform? Get Real!</H1>


<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>by Steven R. Van Hook</H2>

<H4>

<DD>The collective cry to cut welfare subsidies for the poor is banging loudly
 on our eardrums.  Taxpayers are concerned, and rightly so, about the 
money we have taken from us each April 15 and handed over to someone else.  
<p>
There are big political points to be gained by righteously and raucously 
calling for cuts in government spending and slashing taxes.  Of course,  
poor people are the most obvious recipients of the government dole -- we 
stand behind them in grocery store lines while they count out their food 
stamps.  
<p>
But the poor are not the only ones with hands out for handouts; there are 
many other government subsidies that could and should be cut.  The military,
 well-off seniors, agriculture, the medical profession, industry -- many 
benefit from government largesse.
<p>
Big business is a big beneficiary of government pay-outs.  The government 
could save $265 billion over five years by eliminating or scaling back 120
 spending programs and tax breaks that benefit particular industries, 
according to one moderate think tank.  
<p>
Even the conservative Cato Institute says we would be hard pressed to 
find a single Fortune 500 company that doesn't receive some sort of 
federal aid.  Will we see such political posturing calling for cuts to 
big business?  Unlikely. <P>

<DD>Problem with cutting subsidies is how loud an ox bellows when he's been 
gored. Interest groups and industries benefiting from government handouts 
organize powerful lobbies to protect their booty. The poor typically haven't
 a very loud voice for protest.
<p>
Granted we would all -- especially the poor -- benefit from better 
alternatives to welfare, but let's look a moment at economic realities.  
<p>
The schism between the rich and the poor in America is growing wider and 
wider. In spite of an improving economy, the Census Bureau reports the 
number of Americans living under the poverty line in 1994 increased to 
15 percent of the nation's population (some 39 million American men, women
 and children).
<p> 
In an ideal society, everyone would be given the opportunity and the 
responsibility to work. But our post-industrial society simply cannot 
afford all the labor available. Indeed, a built-in unemployment rate is 
critical to a sound economy.  
<p>
Without a "natural rate" of Americans unemployed, the economy will 
"overheat" with prices and wages rising, and a generalized inflation set 
into motion. Various experts estimate this natural rate somewhere between 6
 and 7 percent, which, not surprisingly, is about where the current 
national unemployment rate resides.
<p>
Where will the welfare rejects go, if our economy is not designed to 
employ them?  Will we tacitly allow them to fester in frustration?  We 
simply cannot cut off assistance without providing opportunities, or we'll
 see explosive results.  
<p>
As demonstrated in Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict, these 
frustrations can violently unleash themselves, and we quickly realize the 
powerless are not so powerless after all.   <P>

<DD>We can sidestep the needs of those unable to find work; we can contemplate
 the anecdotal evidence of those unwilling to work.  But we dare not fool 
ourselves into thinking there is not a price to be paid for ignoring their 
plight.  
<p>
Prisons are expensive, police are expensive, unleashed frustration is 
expensive.  One way or another, we as a society will pay for meeting the 
needs of our neighbors.  
<p>
We need to find creative alternatives based on economic and social 
realities.  We have to look beyond political expediency and demagoguery.  
We have to take count of the true costs and benefits of our reforms.  
We need to be wary of the temptation to find easy scapegoats. 
We have to have heart.
<p>
And we can't be blind to who may be powerless, and who, ultimately, is not. <P>
