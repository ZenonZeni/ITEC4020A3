<p align="center"><b>NORML Testifies Before U.S. Sentencing
Guideline Commission</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 15, Washington, D.C., NORML National Legal Committee
member Marvin Miller, Esq., of Alexandria, VA led a group of
NORML witnesses who testified before the U.S. Sentencing
Commission and urged the adoption of proposed guideline changes
that would benefit marijuana-related defendants in federal court. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller, a former member of the NORML Board of Directors and a
nationally prominent criminal defense attorney, urged the
commission to adopt two proposed guideline changes.&nbsp; The first,
proposed amendment #37, would correct an inequity in the current
guidelines regarding the weight assigned to marijuana plants, for
purposes of sentencing.&nbsp; Currenfly, if the offense involves less
than 50 marijuana plants, each plant is presumed to weigh 100
grams.&nbsp; However, if the offense, involves 50 plants or more,
each plant (including the first 49) is presumed to weigh one kilo
(1000 grams).&nbsp; This formula has created a &quot;sentencing
cliff&quot;-- causing an individual convicted of possessing 50
plants to receive a significantly longer sentence than an
individual convicted of possessing 49 or fewer plants; and an
individual convicted of possessing 100 plants (even if they are
seedlings) is sentenced the same as someone convicted of
distributing 100 kilos of bulk marijuana (although the 100
seedlings would not possibly produce anywhere near that amount of usable
marijuana). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller testified that the 100 gram per plant formula reflects
more accurately the actual potential yield from a single
marijuana plant, and urged the Commission to amend the guidelines
accordingly. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Miller also testified in favor of proposed guideline amendment
#42, regarding the treatment of wet marijuana (fleshly harvested
marijuana) for sentencing purposes.&nbsp; Currently the wet
marijuana is weighed as is, with the defendant receiving a longer
sentence under the current weight-driven guidelines.&nbsp; Under
the proposed amendment, when marijuana has a moisture content
sufficient to render it unusable without drying it, an
approximation of the weight without such excess moisture content
is to be used.&nbsp; Miller told the Commission they should be
looking at the usable amount of marijuana, rather than the bulk
amount -- for sentencing purposes generally -- and urged them to scale
back the penalties overall. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In addition, NORML Board member David Boaz, Executive Vice
President of the Cato Institute, testified on behalf of the
Institute regarding marijuana.&nbsp; Boaz pointed out to the Commission
that there were approximately 784 marijuana offenders convicted
in 1992 for whom the minimum guideline range was greater than the
applicable minimum mandatory sentence.&nbsp; &quot;The cost of
keeping those 784 people in prison for one year is
$16,310,000.&nbsp; If we estimate that they would average four
additional years in prison based on current guidelines, the
taxpayers would be paying more than $65 million in additional
costs for those prisoners...&nbsp; We would be better served by
keeping violent criminals in prison longer by freeing up beds now
used by marijuana offenders.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Other NORML witnesses included former Board member and
cultivation expert Ed Rosenthal of California, and NORML/BACH
activist Lennice Werth of Virginia (who uses marijuana as a medicine).&nbsp;
Rosenthal focused on the issue of the presumed weight of a
marijuana plant, and Werth urged the Commission to find a way in
the guidelines to accommodate those who cultivate marijuana for
medical use.&nbsp; These standout activists were joined by FAMM
Director Julie Stewart and the Drug Policy Foundation Legislative
Director Cheryl Epps.&nbsp; Also present, but not testifying, was
NORML Board member Keith Stroup. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[The U.S. Sentencing Commission's recommendations will become law
in 180 days unless the Congress enacts laws otherwise.&nbsp; For
more information on the U.S. Sentencing Commission hearings and
the time frame in which the Commission can act on NORML's
recommendations, contact the U.S. Sentencing Commission's office

<p align="center"><b>U.S. Congressman Seeks To Halt Free-Speech
On Information Superhighway</b><br>
<b>(Or George Orwell Call Home)</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">October 6, Washington, D.C., prohibition fanatic U.S.
Representative Gerald B.H. Solomon (R-NY) extended his opposition
to any criticism of prohibition to include the Intemet.&nbsp; The following
are excerpts from an October 6 speech Rep. Solomon delivered on
the House floor: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Mr. Speaker, it was recently brought to my attention that
drug legalization advocates are using the electronic information
superhighway to organize the legalization movement and share information
on drug use.&nbsp; The information superhighway was certalnly not
created to propagate such misinformation and the criminal
activity associated with it.&nbsp; This use was brought to my attention
by drug legalization opponents who use the information
superhighway everyday in their vocations.&nbsp;
[Anti-prohibitionists don't use computers in their vocations?
-ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Apparently the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML) recently entered remarks which I personally made in
opposition to drug legalization on this House floor as an example
of 'rabid, right-wing prohibitionist propaganda.'&nbsp; Because I
believe, along with 95 percent of America [myth of consensus
-ed.], that the use of illicit drugs is wrong, I was singled out as
an enemy of drug users.&nbsp; Well, Mr. Speaker, I am
honored.&nbsp; <b><i>The use of illegal drugs is an anathema to
the social and moral fabric of our Nation</i></b>.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Pro-drug use and legalization messages on the information
superhighway through Internet are wrong...&nbsp; As more and more
Americans jump onto this latest technological advancement, more
and more citizens will have access to this ill-advised
information.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Drug legalization advocates from all over the country are
using this universal technology to further their movement and
deceive Americans.&nbsp; As Congress reviews this very important technology
during the 104th Congress, the use of this service by pro-drug
organizations and individuals for the propagation of this ilk
must be addressed.&nbsp; <b><i>As a nation founded on the freedoms
of speech and press, the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness must not be trampled by the disease of illegal drugs</i></b>.&quot;&nbsp;
[Emphasis added -ed.] <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NORML National Director Richard Cowan comments:
&quot;Representative Solomon continues to demonstrate his fear of
free and open discussion.&nbsp; This is typical of the statist
mind-set.&nbsp; NORML believes that freedom has nothing to fear
from the truth--so it is appropriate that Solomon is running
scared.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b>'Drug Peace' In the Middle East?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 14, The <i>Hayward Daily Review</i> reports that &quot;a
panel of experts Monday recommended that Israel's parliament ease
laws agalnst the use of marijuana and hashish.&quot; </p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana &quot;Kingpin&quot; Qualifies For </b><b><u>First</u></b><b>
Federal Execution In 32 Years</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">March 13, <i>Reuters</i> reports that U.S. authorities have
notified David Chandler, 42, that his death sentence will be
carried out March 30 in the first federal execution in 32 years. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to <i>Reuters</i>, Chandler was convicted in 1991 in
Alabama of hiring another individual to kill a member of his
marijuana smuggling ring who had become an informant.&nbsp;
Chandler is the first federal inmate to receive a death sentence
under the 1988 Omnibus Crime Bill.&nbsp; The federal Bureau of
Prisons sald five other inmates are awaiting execution under the
same drug kingpin law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>Reuters</i> reports that prison officials acknowledged that
Chandler's execution, which would be carried out by lethal
injection, could be delayed by his filing of a new appeal. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[NORML <b><i><u>strongly</u></i></b> protests the potential
execution of David Chandler.&nbsp; Mr. Chandler should not be
exposed to an ill-conceived death penalty statute solely because
of his alleged role in a marijuana trafficking operation.&nbsp;
Executing this man, in the name of the 'Drug War', will not deter
or hinder a single nanogram's worth of &quot;drugs&quot; from
being cultivated, sold or consumed in the U.S.&nbsp; <u>So why do
it</u>?&nbsp; For more information on Mr. Chandler's dreadful
plight, contact the Alabama ACLU, Olivia Turner, 205-262-0304.] </p>
