<P>

Mr. Mark Ginsberg, Chairman of the Federal Interagency Energy Management Task
Force and Director of the Federal Energy Management Program opened the
meeting and initiated a round of introductions.  First to report was the
audit working group.<p>

Audit Working Group<p>
Mr. Rick Klimkos (FEMP) reported on the group's activities in Katherine
Mayo's (NREL) absence by reading from her notes.  Ms. Mayo extended thanks to
the Task Force for responding to two questionnaires, one requesting
information on potential funding sources at agencies for audits and another
requesting suggestions for name changes to clarify the two types of audits
offered through FEMP's SAVEnergy Audit Program.  Potential sources of funding
at agencies for audits were identified as originating generally from
headquarters accounts, with some regional funding as well as funding from
operations and maintenance accounts.  Utility demand side management programs
and other third-party funding sources also show potential.  FEMP-funded
audits are still available, but FEMP intends to market these regionally.  The
strategy is to provide initial audits within a region gratis as an incentive
to get project momentum started.<p>

Currently, the two SAVEnergy audits are known as 1) Walk-Through Audits and
2) Comprehensive Audits.  The group recommends that the term "comprehensive"
needs to be included in both names because of its use in Executive Order
12902.  The proposed names of "Level 1 Comprehensive" and "Level 2
Comprehensive" were vetoed due to potential confusion with ASHRAE's
similarly-named audits. (The two SAVEnergy audits correspond with ASHRAE's
levels 2 and 3.)  The Task Force was asked to reach consensus on the
following names:<p><ul> 

<li>SAVEnergy Comprehensive Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) Study
for walk-through audits;<p>

<li>SAVEnergy Comprehensive Plus Analysis for the audits formerly known as
comprehensive audits.</ul><p>

Mr. Ginsberg thought that these names were not intuitive and did not clearly
define the objectives of each type of audit.  The Task Force agreed that the
new names just seem to add more confusion.  Millard Carr (DoD) suggested
"Comprehensive Audit A" and "Comprehensive Audit B."  Mr. Ginsberg asked the
Audit Working Group to revisit this issue and suggest other alternative
names.<p>

The Task Force was asked to consider whether the names of audited  sites
should be released to Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) that request them.  It
was suggested that a disclosure statement be provided at the time the audit
is requested to advise building managers of these types of requests and
obtain permission to release information.  Jim Woods (Commerce), and Beth
Shearer, General Services Administration (GSA), gave the go ahead for release
of this information; however, Ms. Shearer would prefer that ESCOs contact the
GSA regional energy manager rather than the building manager at the site. 
Millard Carr, Department of Defense (DoD), noted that the information is
available through the Freedom of Information Act anyway.  Bill McGovern
(Treasury) and Rich Wickman (NASA) encouraged the idea, suggesting that ESCOs
could help champion projects.<p> 

Water Conservation Working Group<p>

Mr. Klimkos provided an update of the group's activities.  The last working
group meeting had been cancelled because of furlough and snow, but projects
are moving along.  During December, equipment (sinks, toilets, urinals) was
installed at the Denver Federal Center.  The next meeting of the group is
scheduled for Tuesday, February 6, at the National Renewal Energy Laboratory
(NREL) offices in Washington, D.C.  The meeting will focus on the use of
energy savings performance contracting for water conservation projects.<p>

New Technology Demonstration Program<p>

Mr. Ginsberg acknowledged Dave Hunt of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
(PNNL) speaking on behalf of FEMP's New Technologies Demonstration Program. 
Mr. Hunt announced that the fifth Federal Technology Alert, "Natural Gas Fuel
Cells," has been released.  Another Alert scheduled to be released in
February is "Cooling Tower Water Ozonation."  Anyone who is not already on
the mailing list to receive these publications was asked to contact the FEMP
Help Desk at 1-800-566-2877.<p>

PEPCO Update<p>

Mr. Steve Keisner of Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) announced the
availability of applications for the annual energy conservation competition
sponsored by PEPCO, Virginia Power, ASHRAE, and others.  Any type of energy
project is eligible.  He provided a handout and encouraged calls from anyone
with questions.  The deadline for submission is February 16th.  He noted that
while the winner receives a plaque, anyone that applies may participate in
local recognition activities and use their involvement to inform others in
their agency of their energy conservation initiatives.  Karen Thomas (NREL)
added that in many cases the utility will help customers complete the
application.<p>

The merger of PEPCO with Baltimore Gas and Electric is proceeding and will
make them the seventh largest utility in the United States.  A new name has
been chosen, Constellation Energy Corporation, and will be in use by March
31, 1997.<p>

Renewable Working Group<p>

Anne Sprunt Crawley (FEMP) announced that the letters requesting 656
Committee endorsement of the Renewable Working Group's Implementation Plan
will be mailed within a week.  DOE Assistant Secretary Christine Ervin will
sign the letters to the Committee members and ask for endorsement by the
middle of February.  Copies will be provided to Task Force members.  The
working group will field any questions from the Task Force on this activity. 
Mr. Ginsberg indicated that the level of agency involvement has been very
high on this effort and expressed his appreciation of agency
participation.<p>

The last meeting of the Working Group concentrated on project case studies
and energy savings performance contracting.  Renewable projects have an
advantage under ESPC arrangements in that they generate energy that can be
measured easily.  The Renewable Working Group will next meet on Friday,
February 23, 9 am to 12 noon, (location to be announced) and will focus on
passive solar design.<p>

Building Commissioning<p>

Ms. Crawley discussed the draft guide on building commissioning that has been
developed in a joint effort by GSA and DOE.  The guide was developed in
accordance with Section 306 of Executive Order 12902.  Each member of the
Task Force should have received a review copy.  Written comments are due by
February 21st.  Anyone who has not received a copy should contact Ms. Crawley
at 202-586-1505.<p>

Ms. Crawley provided an overview of a January 27th workshop on building
commissioning. It was well attended by representatives from GSA, DoD, and
other agencies.  Task Force members interested in receiving copies of the
workshop notebooks should contact the workshop organizer PECI at
503-248-4636.<p> 

Leasing Working Group<p>

Dean DeVine (FEMP) provided an update on energy efficiency activities for
leased space. He distributed a handout containing 1) current standard clauses
in GSA leasing contracts which might effect energy efficiency and 2) a draft
clause for inclusion in agency standard contracts.  The draft clause allows
any proposer/offeror to include in the base proposal energy efficiency
upgrades to be implemented during the first year of the lease.  It also
directs proposers to contact FEMP to receive the list of energy service
companies qualified to perform energy savings performance contracts.  The
upgrades could pay for themselves through energy savings.<p>

Awareness and Communications<p>

Tatiana Strainic Muessel (FEMP) described the Energy Efficiency Awareness
Tool Kit that will be distributed to Task Force members by March 1st.  The
Tool Kit will provide the in-house energy manager with a menu of energy
efficiency awareness activities to implement which can be tied to holidays or
special events.  The ideas are backed by case studies, factoids, and fact
sheets.  Another tool in the kit is electronic on-line messages that appear
as log-on and log-off reminders of energy efficiency measures designed to
change habits and raise awareness.<p>

This year FEMP is planning to host three video conferences.  The first will
be held in early May to coincide with the annual meeting of the National
Association of Energy Service Companies (NAESCO).  The topic will be ESPC
Part II (a follow-up to the April 1995 video conference).  Focus will be on
updates to the Final ESPC Rulemaking, the new indefinite quantity contract
types, and showcase initiatives.  The second teleconference will be held in
September, the third in November with topics to be determined.<p>

Ms. Muessel intends to reactivate the Awareness Working Group and will
distribute information on upcoming meetings and agenda items in the near
future.<p>

Mr. Ginsberg also discussed FEMP's experimentation with televideo
communication, using cameras mounted on computers to project a caller's image
during telephone conversations. FEMP wants to use this medium as a forum to
bring together regional offices, national laboratories, and others and
thereby reduce transportation costs.  There is potential use for this
technology for set-up in the main auditorium perhaps for the TEEM '96
conference scheduled by GSA for September.  He added that there are some
exciting technologies evolving that will facilitate future awareness and
communication activities.<p>

Federal Energy and Water Management Awards<p>

Mr. Klimkos outlined the changes to the Awards Criteria Package from last
year and distributed copies to the Task Force.  He asked the group to review
the changes and submit comments to him by Tuesday, February 6th.  A summary
of the changes follow:<p>

Award Categories--Increase size designation from 6 or less to 10 or less for
small groups, and from 7 or more to 11 or more for organizations.  The
increase would allow full acknowledgment of partners or others vital to the
project.  Mr. Woods (Commerce) asked if the definition further delineates
that organizational awards will primarily emphasize program and policy
implementation as opposed to project development.  Mr. Ginsberg noted two
issues that center on the distinction between small groups and organizations: 
1) monetary awards (which are no longer authorized) and 2) elimination of
duplicate awards.  Mr. Carr suggested that there be no limit on members in
the small group category and that the agencies should decide for themselves. 
Rich Wickman (NASA) suggested that small groups should be distinguished from
organizations by the fact that each member is identified by name.<p>

Cost-Beneficial Landscape Practices--Further clarification is needed on
examples of cost benefit analysis.  Currently nominees may use any method.<p>

Period of Eligibility--Notice the new definition of eligible contributors in
the ESPC category. Only contracts awarded in fiscal year 1995 will be
eligible.<p>

Number of Awards--In a change from last year, up to 10 awards for renewable
energy utilization will be presented.<p>

Nomination Procedures--New this year, nominations will be accepted from
private sector organizations, such as utilities, energy service companies,
and industrial companies and associations.  These nominations should be
submitted to FEMP and FEMP will notify the agency's energy coordinator of the
nomination.<p> 

Format for Submissions--Mr. Klimkos asked if the number of nominations allowed
from each agencies should be reduced from 30 to 15.  Ms. Shearer, GSA, voted
to keep it at 30 as her agency easily submits 30 nominations a year.  Mr.
Ginsberg noted that the reason for limiting the number is to distinguish the
best nominations from those received before they are forwarded to DOE for
consideration.  It was clarified that nominations submitted by utilities and
the private sector would not be included in the 30 agency count.  Vic
Petrolati, DOE In-house Energy Management (IHEM), suggested that not
including nominations from utilities in the agency count would essentially
give those nominations the advantage of not being screened by the agency. 
The final consensus of the Task Force was to limit each agency to 30
nominations, including those received from the private sector.<p>

Selection Criteria--A paragraph was added concerning the use of an outside
independent evaluator to pre-screen applications before the final evaluation. 
Mr. Ginsberg asked the Task Force for feedback and suggested that a possible
evaluator might be the local chapter of the Association of Energy
Engineers.<p>

Deadline for Submission--Feedback was requested on the May 31st deadline.  Mr.
Carr requested an extension.  Mr. Ginsberg expressed the need for adequate
time to evaluate nominations, notify awardees, and make preparations.  He
expects a larger volume of nominations with the next awards cycle the
evaluation of which would be more time consuming, but noted the awards
program has been moved to November.  The task schedule will be reviewed
before a decision is made but the deadline will not be earlier than May 31st.
Mr. Ginsberg reminded everyone that this is an annual event and Mr. Klimkos
confirmed that the changes suggested here do not change the basic format of
last year's nomination.  It was suggested that the guidance package could be
made available in electronic format on diskette and/or through the
Internet.<p>

Mr. Klimkos again noted that all comments on the criteria are due by close
of business Tuesday, February 6th.  In the spring, a working group will
convene to develop a form for documenting changes to the awards guidance
package.  Another issue that the working group will consider is the use of
weighting factors.<p>

FY97 Budget Issues and Congressional Strategies<p>

Mr. Ginsberg noted the change in direction of energy efficiency funding
necessitates developing themes to defend energy efficiency funding elements. 
Agencies need to develop viable talking points/factoids to defend energy
management budgets.  These points would serve as ammunition for internal
budget discussions.  Examples of these themes are:<p><ul>

<li>illustrate how much savings can accrue from a modest investment<br><ul>
<li>Federal energy management is sound business practice<br>
<li>Government makes a profit with energy management<br>
<li>Protects infrastructure<br>
<li>Energy management is a Government-wide shared responsibility<br>
<li>Environmental and job creation benefits.</ul></ul><p>

In an interesting legislative development, Section 625 of Public Law 104-52,
the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act
permits each Federal agency, except DoD, to retain 50 percent of:<p><ul>

<li>the amount of each utility rebate received by an agency for the
implementation of energy and water conservation measures, and<p>

<li>the amount of the agency's share of measured energy savings resulting
from ESPCs.<p></ul>

The retained amounts will be credited to the agency's accounts that fund
energy and water conservation measures.  The remaining 50 percent will be
transferred to the General Fund of the Treasury at the end of the fiscal year
in which it was received.  Mr. Wickman noted that the language on rebates is
helpful but that the provision may create barriers for energy savings
performance contracting.  Mr. Petrolati stated that it is not very clear how
this provision is to be implemented.  Mr. Ginsberg asked the Task Force to
study the legislation and identify issues of concern.<p>

Mr. Ginsberg noted that the Alliance to Save Energy has convened a year-long
Federal energy reduction working group to study and support energy efficiency
in the Federal Government. The 40-member Federal Energy Productivity
Commission will support agencies by conducting a solid review of barriers and
issues.<p>

Procurement Program Update<p>

Mr. Jeff Harris (LBNL) provided an update on FEMP's energy efficient product
procurement program.  He noted that a major activity this year has been the
development and release of product recommendations.  Residential equipment
has been reviewed.  Residential appliances, lighting, and office equipment
are scheduled next for review.  Mr. Harris also updated the Task Force on the
development of a Basic Ordering Agreement which will streamline the purchase
of energy-efficient, CFC-free chillers through the GSA schedule format.  Mr.
Carr requested a one-page summary of the chiller replacement BOA.<p>

In the product coding area, GSA's forthcoming appliance catalog will
designate energy efficient products with an EE symbol.<p> 

The next meeting of the Procurement Working Group is scheduled for
mid-February.<p>

Measurement and Verification Protocols<p>

Brad Gustafson (LBNL/FEMP) discussed the new Federal protocols that give
guidance on verifying and measuring savings for all kinds of energy
conservation measures.  For the first time, Federal energy managers,
procurement officials and private sector energy services providers will have
standard procedures and guidelines for quantifying energy savings from energy
efficiency projects.  He explained that while procedures existed, a standard
approach was not established before November 1995.  The effort began on the
heels of the National Energy Measurement and Verification Protocols (NEMVP)
which has a broader scope and was developed by a coalition representing AEE,
ASHRAE, and others.  The Federal protocol was developed in parallel with the
National Energy Monitoring and Verification protocol, assuring consistency
for companies doing business with both Federal agencies and private
companies.<p> 

Both the FEMP protocol and the National Energy Monitoring and Verification
protocol are based on three general approaches to assessing savings. The
approaches, called Options A, B, and C, are designed to cover the spectrum of
project complexity:<p><ul>

<li>Option A--measured capacity/stipulated operation<br>
<li>Option B--measured capacity/measured operation (system level)<br>
<li>Option C--continuous whole-building measurements or calibrated computer
model simulation</ul><p>

Intended for use in Energy Saving Performance Contracting (ESPC) and utility
program projects, the protocol provides the methodology for establishing
energy cost savings called for in the ESPC rule.  It is meant to provide a
tool or guidance but is not mandated.  Its greatest use is as an education
tool for field personnel about solicitation development and means to evaluate
proposals.  Mr. Gustafson noted that the document could potentially result in
lower interest rates for energy savings performance contracts and thus make
more projects possible.<p>

The protocols will be mailed directly to Task Force members in mid-February. 
Additional copies may be obtained by contacting the FEMP Help Desk.<p> 

Natural Gas Issues<p>

John Archibald (Deputy Director, FEMP) summarized three issues raised by the
American Gas Association and proposed  recommendations for how they should be
addressed.  He asked the Task Force to consider the three issues and
recommendations and provide any feedback.  Barring any objection, he proposed
submitting the issues to the 656 Committee for approval of the
recommendations.  The three issues are:<p>

Site vs. Source Calculation of BTU Consumption<p>

All agencies report progress against legislated and Executive order energy
savings goals based on energy savings measured at the site where the energy
is put to use, i.e., at the Federal sites.  This differs from the total
effect of energy saved at the power plant which produced the energy for
consumption at the Federal site, i.e., source energy.  Currently, source
energy use is estimated based on average conversion and delivery efficiencies
for the electric and steam energy.  It is reported in an appendix to the
Annual Report to Congress.<p>

In a fuel-switching application where natural gas is substituted for electric
energy, energy savings, measured in BTU per gross square foot, would not
occur when measured at the site but large savings would occur when measured
at the source.  Facilities which are attempting to meet their agency's energy
savings goals might be discouraged from making the change to gas because it
would reflect an increase in site energy use rather than energy savings.  It
is possible the facility would reject the fuel switch even though there would
be cost savings to the Government.  AGA feels this results in a bias against
natural gas, limits the options of the energy manager to choose among
competing fuels, and denies energy managers the opportunity for large energy
cost savings.  AGA recommends that energy decisions be made on the basis of
cost savings.<p>

Mr. Archibald proposes two options for addressing this concern:<p>

    1)	Increase text emphasis in the Annual Report that discusses the
conversion of site to source energy and highlight the Federal sector energy
reduction using source energy. This will increase understanding of Federal
sector efforts to achieve energy goals when measured at the source of
generation. However, by measuring progress toward the goals on a
source-measured basis will show an increase in energy use of 1.4% rather than
a reduction of 11.2% when measured at site.<p>

    2)	Work with Interagency Energy Management Task Force and 656 Committee
to issue a policy statement to achieve cost savings through fuel switching
when either site energy or source energy decreases.  This will allow cost
savings to be achieved without conflicting with energy savings goals.
However, this adds complexity to decisions of thousands of energy
managers.<p>

Use of EIA Gas Price Data<p>

The computer program, BLCC, used to assist agencies in doing cost evaluations
of energy projects incorporates EIA projections for natural gas and other
energy prices.  AGA would prefer that the EIA data was not used but will
accept a warning to the users that  their best estimate of local rates should
be substituted as a first option with EIA rates used in the absence of local
rates.  Mr. Archibald recommends:<p>

    1)	Adding a warning "page" to the BLCC program which advises the user
that the best option is to seek out local rates which can be established with
high confidence and use those rates.  In the absence of those rates, the EIA
rates will still be provided.<p>

    2)	Speed up timing of release of diskettes to provide most recent data
as soon as possible.<p>

Anti-Gas Provision in Code of Federal Regulations<p>

CFR now says, under the old requirement for developing General Operations
Plans, that Federal agencies energy management plans should promote:  "...switching for petroleum fuels and natural gas to coal and other energy
sources...and...shifting energy use from oil and natural gas to other
fuels in more plentiful supply from domestic sources...".   The following
recommendations were proposed:<p>

    1)	Commence a rule making process to change the CFR to eliminate the
"anti-gas" statements.  This would bring all Federal agency related Executive
Orders and Code of Federal Regulations into closer alignment on promoting, or
at least not restricting, natural gas use.<p>

    2)	Initiate a change to the original law followed by a change to the CFR
to eliminate the language.<p>

Reimbursable Work<p>

Mr. Archibald noted that FEMP has received direction to investigate
opportunities for reimbursement for work it performs for other agencies.  To
this end, he asked for Task Force approval to survey approximately 60 people
from across the Government in order to get a handle on what customers would
be willing to pay for FEMP services.  The 60 people selected to receive the
seven-page survey were culled from FEMP's database of recent training program
attendees.  The three main areas in which FEMP would potentially seek
reimbursement would be ESPC support, the SAVEnergy Audits, and training (for
which fees are already being charged).  Other technical assistance areas such
as renewable energy and design assistance might also be considered
reimbursable services.<p>

Phil Wirdzek (EPA) suggested that the Task Force members might be used as a
trial response for the survey.  Mr. Carr suggested that the agencies provide
names of actual decision-makers rather than only class participants.<p>

Federal Utility Partnerships<p>

Lou Harris (FEMP) announced the next meeting of the Federal/Utility
Partnership Working Group will be held on March 6th and 7th in San Diego,
California.  The Partnership was formed two years ago to facilitate working
arrangements between utilities and Federal agencies.  Agenda items will
include:<p><ul>

<li>Washington Policy Update<br>
<li>California Update<br>
<li>Federal Utility Partnership Resource Centers<br>
<li>DoD Update<br>
<li>Monitoring and Verification Protocol:  Impact on Financing</ul><p>

Training<p>

Ted Collins (FEMP) noted that FEMP training catalogs are available through
the FEMP Help Desk.  He also announced a conference titled New Directions in
Federal Energy Management will be held as part of Globalcon '96, April 3-4,
in Denver Colorado.<p>

Annual Report<p>

Mr. Klimkos expressed his appreciation for the agency annual reports which
had already been submitted and asked those agencies which had not yet
submitted reports to do so as soon as possible.   He noted that the FY 1994
Report had been signed and is being printed.  He expects the Reporting
Working Group to meet sometime in March.<p>

656 Committee Meeting<p>

The next 656 Committee meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, March 20, at DOE
Forrestal, Room 8E-089 (Program Review Center), from 9:00 a.m. to 12 p.m. 
FEMP will get letters out to the Task Force and the 656 announcing the
dates.<p> 

The meeting was adjourned at 4:00 p.m.<p>
