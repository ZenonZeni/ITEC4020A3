The department continues its investigations of the natural history of involvement in drugs, the risk factors and consequences of drug abuse, and the co-morbidity between substance abuse, other dysfunctional behaviors, and psychiatric disorders among children, adolescents, and adults. These issues are investigated outside the laboratory in population groups that are studied over time. The drugs of interest include cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, other illicit drugs, and medically prescribed drugs.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our investigations are currently based on four samples:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(l) a longitudinal cohort of former New York State high school students that we have followed for nineteen years from adolescence to the mid-thirties (N=1,160), with data from the two oldest children aged 9 to 17 (N=385), spouses and partners when living in the household (N=621), and teachers (422);
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(2) a national longitudinal sample of young adults (N=12,000) and the women's first-born preadolescent children aged 10 and over (N=581) from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY);
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(3) a random sample of 7th-12th graders representative of junior and senior high school students in public and private New York State schools, drawn from 53 schools throughout the state (N=7,611); and
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
(4) multiple national cross-sectional samples of the general population aged 12 and over from the National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse, varying in size from 8,000 to 29,000 individuals.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our major activities have continued to focus on the impact of parental substance abuse-in particular, maternal use in pregnancy-on children's own drug use and development. We had discovered a significant relationship between maternal smoking during pregnancy on the child smoking thirteen years later, especially daughters, with controls for prenatal drinking, current maternal smoking, and other factors. This past year, we investigated the impact of prenatal drinking. Heavy prenatal maternal drinking increases the risk of the child drinking. However, prenatal smoking appears to have a more pervasive effect than prenatal drinking on adolescent drug use, since, in addition to its effect on smoking, it affects adolescent drinking.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These findings are of great public health import and represent a substantial advance in our understanding of the etiology of substance use. The perinatal effects of maternal drug use suggest novel ways of examining latent and long-term effects of drug consumption during pregnancy. Such consumption may affect brain functioning in utero functionally and in ways that do not become apparent until the child has had opportunities to try the substances. Children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy may also be at greater risk of becoming dependent on a variety of drugs other than nicotine. This is an hypothesis that we plan to test in our further work. We are also exploring the processes, such as increases in behavioral problems in childhood, through which the maternal prenatal effect on drug use would express itself in adolescence.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This past year, under support from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), we initiated a new area of investigation on the relationship between patterns of drug use and drug dependence.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The department has also been involved in two major collaborations. One collaboration is with members of the Department of Child Psychiatry in methodological studies of the epidemiology of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents (child MECA). The second collaboration is with the Program on Human Development and Criminal Behavior at Harvard University, a prospective longitudinal study of individual and community risk factors for delinquency and substance abuse.
