The research laboratories in this area are: Non-Linear Systems Control (Prof. J.K. Mills), Plasma Processing (Prof. J. 
Mostaghimi), Engine Research and Development (Prof. J.S. Wallace) and  Thermodynamics and Kinetics (Prof. C.A. Ward).<p>

Hydrogen ignition:  Experiments are being done to study 
the ignition of gaseous hydrogen-oxygen mixtures, over a 
range of mixture compositions, temperatures, pressures, 
and for a variety of ignition sources (e.g., electric sparks, 
hot surfaces).<p>

Fundamental and applied energy conversion studies of 
high-technology microelectronic and optoelectronic 
materials, mainly crystalline and amorphous thin-film 
semiconductors and laser crystals. Development and 
utilization of novel spectroscopic principles to study and 
characterize such energy conversion materials through 
their optical spectra and a unique, optical-to-thermal 
energy conversion spectroscopy.<p>

<br>
Study of thermal explosions (i.e., the interaction between 
hot molten metal and water or fuel-coolant interactions): 
Experimental investigation of the phenomena and 
computational modeling of the reaction wave. <p>

New restrictive automotive emission standards have led 
to the re-examination of state-of-the-art internal 
combustion engine control methods. Methods of control 
design exist which can be utilized to reliably meet the 
strict emission standards required under new 
government legislation. Work include IC engine dynamic 
modeling and control system design.<p>

Research on thermal plasmas: Spray coating of metals 
and ceramics using dc and microwave plasmas; 
temperature measurements of a microwave plasma by 
emission spectroscopy technique; mathematical 
modeling of rf plasmas; prediction of thermophysical 
properties of thermal plasmas using Boltzmann kinetic 
theory; and, chemical vapor deposition of diamond films 
in a microwave plasma reactor.<p>

Application of surface thermodynamics to energy 
resources processing: Coal and oil sands.  Development 
of strategies to determine the wettability of finely- 
ground coal with the view of improving coal separation 
from minerals by flotation.<p>

Research on combustion in reciprocating IC engines: 
Spark ignition alternative fueled engines; direct injection 
alternative fueled engines; optical measurement 
techniques for the combustion process; and engine 
control systems.<p>

A hydrogen storage system for automotive applications is 
being developed that involves a lightweight, compact 
system for on-board production of hydrogen, and a 
lightweight man-portable DC-power supply is being 
developed that consists of a KOH fuel cell and a 
hydrogen storage system. Also, the factors that control 
the corrosion of fuel cell electrodes are under 
investigation using neutron activation analysis and mass 
spectrometry.<p>
