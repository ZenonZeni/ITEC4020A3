SLANTS & TRENDS

NEW READINGS OF URANIUM CONTAMINATION in wells drilled at the Feed
Materials Production Center may be alarming the public needlessly. Regular
monitoring of ground water contamination in an admittedly contaminated area
last spring showed a sudden spike in uranium concentrations,
and comments by officials from the U.S.  Department of Energy and Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency were misinterpreted.

ALTHOUGH THE LEVELS WERE 10-30 TIMES as high as proposed standards by the
federal EPA, results in the lower end of that range were fully expected.
When word of higher readings came out early this month, newspapers and
newswire services quickly said the officials suspected new contamination
and even contended the water supply of Cincinnati, 18 miles away, and
Dayton, 40 miles away, might be endangered.

NO SUCH THREAT EXISTS, the officials tell DPW, and they never hinted at
one. Graham Mitchell of Ohio EPA explained his comment about the
contamination possibly being more recent meant it might have happened 10
years ago instead of 20 years ago. And while contaminated wells are tapping
a part of the same aquifer used for drinking water for Dayton, the polluted
plume extends only about 1.5 miles from the plant and is heading away from
that city. Even though it is headed generally toward Cincinnati, both DOE
and Ohio EPA officials are confident it can be stopped long short of there.
"I don't think it will ever have the chance to get to Cincinnati," said
Mitchell.

IF FERNALD AND ROCKY FLATS LOOK BAD, the explosion at a high-level nuclear
waste dump at Kyshtym in the USSR was much worse than anyone has admitted,
the Soviets now say.  That accident in the late 1950s released not the 2
million curies admitted by Soviet officials only a year ago, but 20 million
curies. This compares to the 50 million curies released by the Chernobyl
civilian nuclear accident.

DOE TO DEVELOP DEEP BOREHOLE SAMPLING
TECHNIQUES IN MICROBIOLOGY PROGRAM

    Department of Energy will develop and evaluate sampling techniques in
fiscal 1990 and 1991 under its Deep Microbiology Program. This will be
followed by an accelerated five-year (FY'92-96) Phase II research program
including field experimentation to test new concepts with contaminated
zones at one or more DOE sites.

    The 15- to 20-year goal of the program is to contribute new scientific
information that will make bioremediation of contaminated DOE sites easier,
the agency says in an implementation plan. Experience gained at the DOE
sites will be transferred to other agencies and to private industry. The
most important scientific goal of the transitional program is to obtain
comparative information on subsurface microbial communities among DOE
sites.

    At present, DOE says, "no cost-effective technologies exist for cleanup
of ground water contamination at depths of 400-600 ft. or greater." By
studying the presence, diversity and adaptability of deep microorganisms at
various sites, DOE hopes to contribute to, and speed the cleanup of, deep
aquifers. "Recently discovered deep microorganisms obtained [last year]
during Phase 1 appear to be physiologically capable of degrading
recalcitrant organic chemicals (and possibly organic-radionuclide
complexes), and their activity may be enhanced in-situ to eliminate or
transform contaminants," says the implementation plan.

    DOE's Richland and Idaho Operations Offices, Pacific Northwest
Laboratory's Environmental Sciences Research Center and the Idaho National
Laboratory, run by EG&G Inc., will provide financial and scientific
support. DOE's Office of Energy Research Subsurface Science Program is
funding competitive research and essential logistical tasks to ensure
aseptic samples are obtained.

    DOE will implement the transitional program at INEL and the Hanford
site. Results at the first site will meet two or more scientific
objectives in the program plan and provide scientific and technological
experience needed to confirm results or meet objectives at the next site.
Site sampling and analysis will be completed sequentially through
activities at INEL, Hanford and the Nevada Test Site. Operational and
scientific payoffs of FY'90 activities are as follows:

    o Savage Island Exploratory Borehole (Hanford). Operational:
Development of microbial tracers; initial experience in hard-rock sampling
protocols; refinement of rotary-mud drilling methods for partially
consolidated sediments. Scientific:  First indication of microbes in deep
zones with different hydrochemistry from SRS; improved detection of
microbial contamination with labelled natural bacteria.

    o Snake River Deep Interbed Probe (INEL). Operational: Enhanced use of
hard-rock and unconsolidated sampling for use at Hanford; specific
evaluation of use of new air/argon drilling technique for microbial sample
acquisition. Scientific:  Substantiation of lack of organisms in
low-permeability formations; determination of organism distribution
patterns in fracture flow terrain at DOE sites; determination of organism
physiology and distribution in high-flow ground water.

    o Aseptic Sampling Technology Development (Hanford). Operational:
Development and evaluation of new aseptic sampling methods for collection
of high-quality microbiological samples in varied and complex
hydrogeologic systems at DOE sites.

    o Western States Mixed Softrock/Hardrock Sequence (Hanford/Yakima
Barricade).  Operational: Use of verified aspectic techniques for mixed
soft- and hard-rock sequence; demonstation of particle/colloid and
microbial tracer efficiency under complex hydrologic conditions
representative of DOE sites. Scientific: Widening range of lithologies,
geochemistry and permeabilities to maximize comparative opportunities with
SRS; varied ground water age and recharge sources to make unique genetic,
physiological and metabolic comparisons to organisms at SRS and INEL.

    o Subsurface Hardrock Spatial Variability Experiment (NTS).
Operational: Refine statistical sampling strategy to assess
multi-dimensional distribution of organisms; improve techniques for
isolation of microbes from hard-rock samples.  Scientific: Document rock
fracture control on organism distribution; identify minimum sample size to
define macroscopic population characteristics; unique data-set on microbial
distributions for application of geostatistical techniques.

    o Contaminated Site/Bioremediation Research Site (FY'91). Operational:
Use of specialized aseptic sampling techniques in chemically contaminated
environments; co-quantification of chemical and microbiological
distribution with depth; use of proven tracer technology to document sample
integrity. Scientific: Effects of organic/inorganic contaminants on
microbial populations, activity and diversity; indentification/isolation of
contaminant-adapted or contaminant-using organisms; microbial distributions
in a representative site requiring bioremediaton.

RISK OF CANCER FROM LOW-LEVEL EXPOSURE
TO RADIATION COULD BE HIGHER THAN THOUGHT

    The risk of developing cancer from exposure to low levels of X-rays and
gamma rays could be as high as 3-4 times greater than those previously
estimated, but epidemiological studies of nuclear weapons workers appear to
show only that the risks are as high as expected, says a National Research
Council committee.

    The committee updated findings of the BEIR III panel, which issued its
report on health effects from alpha particle emitters. Higher risk
estimates presented in the new report, BEIR V, stem from new risk models,
revised dose estimates for survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic
bombs, and additional epidemiological data on cancers and other health
effects experienced by both A-bomb survivors and persons exposed to
radiation for medical purposes.

    The new report notes several studies reviewed on nuclear worker
epidemiology "have yet to accumulate a sufficient number of deaths to reach
any sensible conclusions relating to individual types of cancer. The most
consistent result ...  is that the risk estimates for all types of cancer
combined and for all types of leukemia combined are consistent with the
risk estimates" in BEIR V.

    The worker studies include reviews of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.
(Windscale Plant and Sellafield Plant) in the United Kingdom; Hanford Site,
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant, and Rocky Flats
Nuclear Weapons Plant, in the U.S.; and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. in
Canada, along with studies of workers at civilian nuclear plants.

    Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on Dec. 20 directed Peter Brush,
acting assistant secretary for environment, safety and health, to review
the BEIR V report and its potential implications for DOE's nuclear
operations, including making recommendations for modifying operations,
where needed. Watkins called for an interim report within 90 days and a
final report by June 30, 1990.

GAO OFFERS DOD ADVICE ON MINIMIZING AMOUNT
OF UNUSED HAZARDOUS WASTE SENT FOR DISPOSAL

    The Department of Defense fails to minimize unused hazardous materials
transferred for disposal, the General Accounting Office says in a newly
released report. The accounting arm of Congress based its analysis on a
random sample from 10 installations, finding that 40% of the waste was
unused hazardous materials.

    Hazardous materials with a $250 million acquisition value were
transferred for disposal during fiscal 1986-88, says the report, prepared
at the request of Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Calif.), chairman of the House
Government Operations Subcommittee on the Environment. Materials initially
worth more than $195 million were disposed of in FY'86-88 by sales to the
public (43%), disposal service contracts (31%), reuse within DOD (13%),
transfer/donation to non-DOD users (12%) and miscellaneous disposals (less
than 1%). The remainder will stay in storage until a decision is reached on
the manner in which the materials will be disposed of.

    The inventory control procedure of first-in, first-out (FIFO), which
can minimize the chance of hazardous materials becoming hazardous waste
due to shelf-life expiration, is not always followed because of a lack of
internal controls, GAO found. Some exceptions to the procedure are
permitted that do not fully take into account extra costs incurred in the
disposal of hazmat.

    DOD does not always follow its regulations that the condition of
hazardous materials be evaluated periodically, GAO points out. The rules
also say shelf life is extended after inspection and testing at the depot
or installation, when possible. Officials contacted by GAO blame the lack
of evaluations on funding constraints, inadequate emphasis by management or
a lack of guidance to users on how to evaluate hazmat conditions. Such
materials sometimes are transferred for disposal without testing or
evaluation to see if shelf-lives could be extended, GAO maintains, and some
Army installations keep hazmats in their inventories for an extended period
of time without evaluating their condition.

    DOD uses the same management procedures for hazardous and nonhazardous
materials, GAO notes. If it had special procedures for managing hazmat
inventories, the report concludes, the cost of unnecessary disposal and
potential liability for environmental damage and future cleanup costs could
be decreased.

    Some improvements are on the way, GAO adds. The Navy established
instructions June 20, 1989, to improve life-cycle management of its
hazmats. The rules address management of hazmat inventories, including
controls over their procurement, management procedures for excess hazmats
and waste, quality assurance evaluations, documentation, and record-keeping
and reporting. These elements bring a structure to the management of wastes
in the Navy, GAO contends, pointing out that the Air Force and Army have no
comparable effort under way.

    GAO wants each service to provide special attention to inventory
management procedures for hazmats. These should include directing the
Defense Logistics Agency and the General Services Administration, through
the memorandum of agreement between DOD and the GSA, to make greater use
of direct delivery contracts for hazmats with a short shelf-life; supply
organizations to make greater use of FIFO procedures for short shelf-life
hazmats and to discourage exceptions; and supply depots and installations
to evaluate the condition of hazmats consistently through periodic testing
or inspections before sending them out for disposal.

    Free copies of "Hazardous Waste -- Attention to DOD Inventories of
Hazardous Materials Needed," GAO/NSIAD-90-11, are available from GAO, Box
6015, Gaithersburg, Md. 20877, (301) 275-6241.

EPA REGION 5 PROPOSES INCREASE IN PENALTY
AGAINST WESTINGHOUSE FOR FMPC VIOLATIONS

    Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio would receive a much stiffer fine
than initially proposed for violations at the Feed Materials Production
Center at Fernald, under a motion filed by the Environmental Protection
Agency Region 5. The amended complaint, filed Dec. 19, asks for $330,500
and is based on violations discovered at the facility after an initial
filing of a Feb. 9, 1989, complaint with a proposed fine of $196,500.

    During two inspections last August and October, EPA found more than 25
new and recurring violations of federal hazardous waste regulations.
Specifically, EPA alleges that Westinghouse has failed to complete required
waste analyses and waste determination plans; failed to designate itself as
operator on the hazardous waste permit application; continued to monitor
ground water inadequately; and submitted inadequate closure plans,
operating records, job descriptions and training records.

    EPA filed this latest motion with Administrative Law Judge Thomas Hoya.
If Hoya grants the motion to amend the original complaint and boost the
penalty, Westinghouse will have the right to request a hearing to contest
any new allegations made by the federal government.

    In a related note, the Department of Energy says it is dropping its
appeal of a $78 million judgment by the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio resolving a $300 million suit filed in 1985 by
the facility's neighbors, who maintain that radioactive emissions over
three decades from the plutonium-processing plant have endangered their
health, caused emotional distress and lowered the property value of their
houses (DPW, July 7, 1989).

    "We're not going to pursue our appeal," explained DOE attorney Steven
Wakefield, but "the bad news is that the department discovered earlier [in
the week of Dec. 17] that it cannot pay the judgment from a fund it had
planned to use." DOE had wanted to use a federal contingency fund, but was
barred from doing so because the suit was initially filed against a
contractor, not the government.  DOE now must seek a separate appropriation
from Congress to establish the fund.

    The plaintiffs accepted the decision -- with the money earmarked for
lifetime epidemiological studies and health monitoring -- but the final
agreement and acceptance by Judge S. Arthur Spiegel was held up as DOE
disagreed with plaintiffs over the decision's interpretation (DPW, Sept. 1,
1989). Two private companies in the area had complained that some
of the industrial waste pollution for which they had been cited separately
was due to FMPC's operations. One corporate complainant said his firm's
property value also was diminished, but the court said he would have to
file separately for compensation.

    DOE had appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit, arguing the accord barred any future claims, but plaintiffs
contended that it covered only emotional distress and reduction of property
values. They demanded they could still file to obtain funds to cover
cleanup work; DOE had said some of the $78 million could be earmarked for
cleanup.

    The suit had involved FMPC's operations by NLO, a subsidiary of
National Lead of Ohio, the former contractor, which went out of business.
Because of NLO's departure, DOE had to step in as defendant. The change in
the operations and maintenance contract came after the initial filing and
before the settlement. The contract was transferred to Westinghouse at end
of 1985. Activities at the plant were suspended last year to speed up
decontamination.

BATTELLE SENSOR FOR DETECTING CONTAMINANTS
IN SOIL TO BE MORE ACCURATE, LESS EXPENSIVE

    Battelle Memorial Institute's device for improving detection of fuel
oil, stored gasoline, solvents and other organic liquids dumped or leaking
into soil (DPW, Dec. 22, 1989) is expected to be more accurate,
less expensive and simpler to use than current competing technologies.
Developed by researchers at Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest
Laboratory, operated by Battelle, the device will be made available for
commercialization and manufacture.

    Battelle's new sensor, constructed from materials costing less than
those employed in current devices, could be used by environmental
researchers to measure the amount and location of organic liquids that
have seeped into the soil.  "It could be used to detect leaks in new
storage tanks as well as to monitor the severity of leaks from older
storage facilities," suggests John W. Cary of Battelle's Earth and
Environmental Sciences Center.

    Cary created the sensor to assist Battelle researchers in their studies
of how organic fluids move in the subsurface environment and how to reduce
or repair their ecological effects. "Traditionally, devices such as 'gypsum
blocks' are used to measure water content within soil," he explained.
"These measuring instruments are more expensive and do not detect organic
liquids. On the other hand, most sensors that are used to detect organic
liquids in soils detect vapors rather than the presence of liquid. These,
too, are expensive."

    The sensor features an optical switch containing a solid-state
infrared-light-emitting device joined to a porous disk made of ceramic,
fritted glass, PTFE (Teflon) or various carbon-based materials. Which
material is selected determines whether water or organic liquid is absorbed
into the pores.

    The disk is placed into the soil where liquid, if present, is absorbed.
Light transmitted through the disk is measured and is proportionate to the
amount of water or organic liquid that is absorbed into the pores. The
amount of liquid in the disk can be related to the amount of liquid in the
surrounding soil. The disk remains in the soil the entire time the
measurement is made.

ARMY TESTING COMPOSTING OF SOIL
TO ELIMINATE EXPLOSIVE CONTAMINATION

    The U.S. Army's 19,700-acre Umatill Depot near Hermiston, Ore., will be
the testing site for an experiment in treating soil contaminated by
explosives. The composting experiment will use microorganisms to consume
the contaminants in soils and sediments, explains Capt. Craig Myler,
project officer for the Army's Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency
(USATHAMA).

    Because microbes do not naturally feed quickly enough on TNT particles,
they will be coaxed in tests in special greenhouses, where soil is enriched
with addi tional microbe food sources, such as hay, straw, manure or
livestock feed. Much of the contamination comes from dry ponds used 25
years ago to settle out high-explosive residues, Myler says. The explosive
material seeped through the ponds' sandy bottoms.

    Contamination also had spread across some 1,100 acres used for disposal
of rocket fuels, battery acid, explosives and propellants. Some of these
pollutants, which include nitrates, nitrites, cyanide and metals, have
migrated to ground water. The composting system is less expensive than
incineration, the only alternative. Burning the residue costs about $300
per ton, or as much as three times that for composting.

DOE'S IDAHO AND RICHLAND OFFICES
SEEK BETTER CLEANUP TECHNOLOGIES

    The Department of Energy's Idaho and Richland Operations offices will
seek better technologies to solve waste management and environmental
restoration problems in Idaho and Washington under a new agreement. The
accord will address Secretary James D. Watkins' Environmental Restoration
and Waste Management Five-Year Plan initiatives announced earlier this year
(DPW, Sept. 1, 1989).

    The new agreement will run through Sept. 30, 1994, providing for
collaboration on waste management and environmental restoration issues
among the Boise and Richland offices, their contractors, and universities
in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. Funding for the activities will
be provided by DOE as part of Idaho and Richland Operations offices'
approved spending plans.

    The agreement encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) establishing a
DOE team to address parallel research needs and activities; (2) focusing of
combined expertise on objectives of regional interest and national
importance; (3) drawing on existing working relationships effectively to
use technical expertise and experience to assure appropriate resource
application in specific areas of waste management and environmental
restoration; and (4) developing a consortium of the laboratories and other
DOE contractors with northwestern and mountain states universities for
promoting waste management and environmental restoration education through
educational training support and research and development opportunities.

    The accord involves nine areas of collaboration: stabilizing or
destroying waste on site; quantifying potential health and environmental
risks and exposure reductions; processing wastes to recover potentially
useful materials; treating solid and liquid wastes using high temperatures;
developing robotic waste retrieval technologies; differentiating specific
waste sites; demonstrating technologies; developing waste minimization
techniques; and collaborating with universities on research and training.
Additional areas might be added.

    The first tier in a three-tiered management will be a committee of
operations office managers, laboratory directors and operating contractor
presidents/general managers. The second tier will be a six-member steering
committee from each operations office and up to two representatives from
their laboratory or operating contractor. It will be co-chaired by the
operations office representatives. The third tier will consist of activity
project managers, with an Idaho National Engineering Laboratory and a
Hanford project manager for each activity.

    "The collaborative agreement provides a means for better use of time,
talent and funds in solving waste management and environmental restoration
issues important to the Pacific Northwest and the nation," said Watkins.
"An important part of this agreement involves collaboration not just
between different groups in one federal agency, but with regional
universities as well.

    "We expect the universities to play an important role in research on
waste cleanup issues and in developing education and training programs in
waste management and environmental-related areas," Watkins added. "We
believe the education and training programs fostered by this agreement will
produce the additional skilled people needed to clean up both industrial
and DOE wastes." Since he first arrived on the job, Watkins has complained
that he could not find enough trained and experienced people to mount the
effort he would like.

    The agreement was signed by the two operations offices, Battelle
Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Westinghouse Hanford Co., Westinghouse Idaho
Nuclear Co., EG&G Idaho Inc., Mountain State Energy Co. and UNC Geotech.

DROUGHT MAY BE TO BLAME FOR HIGH URANIUM
LEVEL OF CONTAMINATION IN GROUND WATER AT FMPC

    Surprisingly high uranium contamination levels found in wells drilled
70 ft.  into the Great Miami River Aquifer from a point in the southwest
corner of the Feed Materials Production Center at Fernald, Ohio, could have
been the result of last summer's drought, says Andrew Avel, deputy
environmental manager of the Department of Energy's Site Office.

    The contamination had been known for years, but the concentration
levels unexpectedly rose from 309 + 51 parts per billion (ppb) in
samplings taken in late February 1989 and reported the following month, to
851 + 136 ppb in tests made on May 11 and results received June 19, and
fell back down to to 232 + 39 ppb in samples taken July 28 and results
reached on Sept. 7, DPW was told by Avel.

    One theory is that the contamination results from a temporary, partial
drying of the aquifer during a drought last summer. All the readings are
many times higher than U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's unreleased
proposed standard of 30 ppb; there are no standards in place today. The
reduced rainfall could have caused the ground water flow to reverse its
normal southerly course and place the test wells downstream, instead of
upstream, of contamination sources in the nuclear weapons facility, DPW
was told. Renewed rainfall could have returned the gradient to its normal
course, according to this line of thinking at DOE.

    The readings were taken by Advanced Sciences Inc., contractor to the
Department of Energy, not to Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio (WMCO),
operations and management prime contractor at FMPC. They are part of the
remedial investigation/ feasibility study (RIFS) to characterize the
environment surrounding the plant.  Now in the effort's "RI" stage, the
tests on wells within the plant site were made to gather information for a
data base for future environmental restoration.

    The results were first released publicly about two weeks ago by WMCO's
Advisory Committee, an independent group of local citizens, who had been
briefed by WMCO in a regularly scheduled quarterly meeting that touched on
the results of the monitoring of the wells. The readings' results were
buried in the citizen group's press release and picked up Jan. 3 by the
Cincinnati Enquirer.

    The contaminated plume appears to be moving south at a rate of about
200 ft.  per year and now extends some 1.5 miles away from the plant. The
contaminated water wells tap into the Great Miami River Aquifer. No known
polluted water is used for drinking, but some water unsafe for drinking is
treated and used for industrial purposes. Ohio EPA wants to assure
availability of water supplies from the aquifer even though the main water
supply for Cincinnati is the Ohio River.

    The monitoring wells were drilled specifically for the test; they are
not used to draw water for other purposes. Production wells in the area are
checked often, Avel said, and those that have been identified as
contaminated are no longer being used for drinking water. The few outlying
wells in use for drinking water have readings essentially at background
level and are being monitored.

    DOE is working on an agreement with the state and EPA to find a
solution to the contaminated water. One option under consideration is to
pump out the water from the contaminated plume, treat it and return it to
the surface of the ground, DPW has been told, but there is no commitment
yet to take any particular action.  DOE maintains that the 1989 readings
pose no new threat to the public and are not evidence of any new instance
of contamination from FMPC, although that may be the public perception. "We
are concerned, but it's really nothing that surprises us," Avel told DPW.

LAWRENCE LIVERMORE ASKS EPA TO REVIEW
REFUSAL ON HAZARDOUS WASTE PERMIT

    Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has delivered the plans
for operating its incinerator and hazardous waste storage and treatment
facility to the California Department of Health Services (DHS) and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. The 12 volumes are the documentation LLNL
needs to obtain a permit to run the facility.

    They were provided in response to notification of EPA's proposed
intention to deny a hazardous waste permit for nearly all waste operations
at LLNL. The material was delivered in person at a Dec. 18 meeting with
agency officials, but there has been no comment from EPA since, one
official from LLNL's Environmental Protection Department (EPD) told DPW.

    A second EPD official, Susi Jackson, said, "We have worked hard to
comply with regulatory agenda requirements and have documented our
accomplishements and plans for the future in this highly detailed
documentation." She noted that the report "includes a health risk
assessment of our existing incinerator and other documents that reflect our
response to regulatory agency concerns.

    Jackson said LLNL's goal is "to work with EPA and DHS to ensure that
our waste storage and treatment facilities are absolutely in compliance
with existing laws. We have worked closely with the agencies to resolve
all outstanding issues related to the permit applications.

    The lab has "made a strong effort to meet agency requirements and to
assure them of [LLNL's] commitment to operate its facility in an
environmentally sound manner, consistent with regulatory requirements. By
expediting our efforts, we have completed all construction and other tasks
that were scheduled for the next several years under regulatory
requirements.

DOE 'TIGER TEAMS' TO CHECK
LIVERMORE LATE NEXT MONTH

    A Department of Energy "Tiger Team" will inspect the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory late next month to assess its compliance with
environmental, health and safety regulations. These 25-person investigative
teams are visiting all 18 major facilities in the nuclear weapons complex
plus dozens of other laboratories and installations. They already have
been to Rocky Flats, Fernald, Mound, Pantex, Y-12 and a civilian nuclear
energy facility in New York State.

    Tiger Team members will visit LLNL within a few weeks to make
pre-assessments and develop an agenda for the full-scale investigation,
tentatively set for Feb.  26, explains John Clatworthy, a hazards control
officer. Clatworthy has just returned to LLNL after spending a year at DOE
headquarters as technical and science advisor to the director of the Office
of Weapons Safety and Operations.
