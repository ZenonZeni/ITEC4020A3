  This fact sheet provides a definition of learning disability (LD) in adults; 
a list of common elements found in many useful LD definitions; and a list of 
areas in which LD may affect life situations of adults.  The background of the 
concept of "learning disability" is briefly reviewed, followed by the 
definition of the Interagency Committee on Learning Disabilities, which was 
selected for use by the National Adult Literacy and Learning Disabilities 
Center because it reflects current information and issues associated with LD, 
allows for the presence of learning disabilities at any age, and has wide 
acceptance in the LD community.  Highlights of the definition are pointed out, 
as are common elements in a variety of LD definitions.  Definitions adopted by 
the U.S.  Office of Education in 1977, the Learning Disabilities Association of 
America, the National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities, and the 
Rehabilitation Services Administration are also provided.  Finally, a brief 
discussion identifies areas in which LD impacts adults, including self esteem, 
education, vocation, social interactions, and independent living.  (DB)<BR>

  Target Audience: Practitioners<BR>
  This guide is intended to help the literacy practitioner in the 
identification of adults with learning disabilities.  These adults have worked 
diligently for a year or more to improve comprehension skills, writing and 
spelling, or work skills, yet, have made little progress.  The role of 
screening as only the first step in a process involving a formal assessment by 
a qualified professional, is stressed.  First, a set of questions to be 
answered by the literacy practitioner as he/she observes the individual is 
provided.  Next are lists of typical characteristics of individuals with 
vision/hearing and/or auditory/visual processing problems.  Following this is a 
list of typical problems in three areas of academic performance: reading, 
expressive language, and mathematics.  A list of behavior patterns and 
psychological manifestations indicating the possibility of a learning 
disability is also provided.  Finally, other means of information gathering 
such as reviews of records, a screening interview, a screening questionnaire, 
and a screening tool are suggested.  (DB)<BR>

  This booklet brings together one-page to two-page abstracts from research 
poster sessions held at a conference on learning disabilities.  The 17 research 
abstracts are presented within four poster session categories: (1) research on 
assessment and characteristics of students with learning disabilities (with 
abstracts on handwriting, mainstreaming students with dyslexia, and executive 
functioning and phonological processing in attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder and reading disability); (2) research on adolescents and adults with 
learning disabilities (with abstracts on prevention of sexual abuse, depression 
and anxiety in college students and rehabilitation clients, college programs, 
and prediction of university academic achievement); (3) research on instruction 
and treatment (with abstracts on language intervention with preschool children, 
alternative delivery systems, prevocational training, teaching language 
functions through the fine arts, biofeedback as a treatment for attention 
deficit disorders, and technological applications); and (4) a second session 
dealing with research on instruction and treatment (with abstracts on promising 
programs, university and public school partnerships, classwide peer tutoring, 
and improving reading comprehension and writing through content classes).

  Assessment models used with school-age samples require modification for use 
with adults having severe learning disabilities.  At Fordham University's 
Comprehensive Learning Program, a screening session determines the mutual 
suitability of the client and the program being offered; subsequent 
comprehensive assessment of cognitive, educational, emotional, and motivational 
factors is then carried out for intervention planning.  (DB)<BR>

  This literature review focuses on the outcome of childhood learning 
disabilities, adult symptomatology, and the educational and vocational status 
of adults with learning disabilities.  It concludes that learning disabilities 
are life-long disabilities and that childhood deficiencies in reading, 
language, memory, attention, visual perception, and social-emotional adjustment 
tend to persist.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  This resource guide is designed to help adults who suspect they have a 
learning disability gather sufficient information to set realistic goals, 
achieve those goals, and lead productive lives.  The first section, which 
discusses assessing learning disabilities, includes lists of agencies equipped 
to help diagnose learning disabilities in adults and questions to ask qualified 
professionals.  A checklist of 28 identified characteristics of adults with 
learning disabilities is presented along with annotated lists of 13 national 
resource centers, 9 organizations concerned with general education, 8 learning 
disability organizations, 3 attention deficit disorder organizations, 4 
organizations concerned with employment issues, 5 organizations concerned with 
technology, 16 organizations concerned with life management issues, and 20 
publications of relevance to learning-disabled adults.  A list of 16 pertinent 
toll-free numbers and information on the HEATH Resource Center and National 
Adult Literacy and Learning Disabilities Center conclude the guide.  (MN)<BR>
