<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>Who Should Be a NAMI Member?</H2>
<H4>by Annie Saylor, NAMI President
</H4></font>
<hr>
	First we might ask, why make NAMI membership a priority?  
Consider the population of the U.S.--248.7  million according to 
the 1990 census.  Assume a prevalence rate of 1 percent for the 
brain disorders known as serious mental illness.  (A very low 
estimate.)  That means there are nearly 2.5 million people who have 
these disorders.  Each of those people has at least 2.5 close 
family members who have also been affected by brain disorders.  
That gives us a total of 8.75 million people who should be NAMI 
members.  And we are content with a membership of 140,000?
<P>
	Consider the clout of AARP with its 33 million members.  The 
recent parity effort shows us that NAMI packs its own punch, but 
we're the "little engine that could," working our hearts out to end 
the discrimination.  What could we accomplish with one million 
members?  How can we get there?
<P>
	Let me make it clear that I do not advocate that we give up 
our governance by family (and that means all family members, 
including the consumer) at the local, state, and national levels.  
We must maintain the decision-making authority, but we need to find 
ways to grow the organization. 
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">We need to broaden our concept of membership.</font>  I came to NAMI 
via the traditional route:  found a local NAMI affiliate for 
support and information, joined that local group, which in turn 
sent a portion of my dues to the state and then to NAMI.  And that 
is how I continue to be a NAMI member.  However, more people in the 
90s generation want good information quickly and have less time and 
need for that "traditional" membership, for making the same 
commitment of time and energy as we do.  We need those people for 
membership.  We need to show that we value them as members even if 
they are unable to be active members.  We must be like a fast-food 
service.  We must welcome those who want to use the drive-through 
just as much as those who want to come in, sit down, and dine. 
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">We need to gladly receive professionals as members.</font>  Not only 
are professionals more likely to have a multiplier effect on our 
membership, professionals also have a higher incidence of brain 
disorders within their own families.  Those "pro-sumers" themselves 
have nowhere to go in many cases because of the stigma that still 
exists within their own ranks.  This category includes 
psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, care managers, social 
workers, nurses, school counselors and teachers, and pastoral 
counselors.
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">We need to market our membership.</font>  This month NAMI kicks off 
our second annual membership contest.  (See article in NAMI News 
section.)  Every affiliate is eligible to participate in this 
contest; therefore, every affiliate has the opportunity to win a 
cash award.  The contest also offers a wonderful opportunity for 
you to recruit new affiliate members.  The more new members you 
recruit, the greater the chances your affiliate will win a cash 
award--money that you can use for local programs.  It may seem 
obvious, but think of it:  If every NAMI member recruits just one 
new member, we will double our membership.  
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">We need to make it easier to become a member.</font>  Have you ever 
considered the steps it takes to become a member?  First one must 
learn about a local group and then get the courage to seek them out 
and to go to a meeting.  Then, depending upon the effectiveness of 
the local affiliate's membership outreach, one may or may not be 
asked to join.  Finally, should one choose to become a member, the 
process by which one's name finally reaches NAMI and gets into the 
database is laborious.  We need to streamline that process.
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">We must actively seek out ethnic and minority population 
members. </font> We must not do lip service to this effort, but genuinely 
work to engage those people in our communities from ethnic and 
minority populations.  We must review and renew our outreach 
efforts.  Projections are that by the year 2005, the Spanish-
speaking peoples will be the largest minority group in America.  
And not too many years after that the "minority" populations will 
be in the majority.
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">So who should be a NAMI member? </font> The person being treated for 
depression down the hall where you work?  The mom and dad whose 
child has a disorder?  The child's school counselor and teachers?  
Those siblings, offspring, and partners whose lives have been 
affected but have never reached out?   Your co-workers who have no 
experience with brain disorders, but who would support the cause 
due to your involvement?  The student who finds the NAMI web site 
during an Internet search?  The person who calls the NAMI Helpline? 
 My ill sister's case manager?  Her psychiatrist?  
<P>
	Yes, yes, yes!  To all of these, and more.  We must seek them 
out and make it easy to join.  As we win the fight against 
discrimination and stigma, our membership should grow.  It should 
be just as natural to support our cause as it is to support the 
American Cancer Society, the Heart Association, or any other 
organization of this kind.  
<P>
	So what can you do?  Take those names and addresses to your 
local affiliate.  Follow up with these people as well as with the 
people who attend your local support group meeting.  Ask them to 
become members.  And don't forget to forward those names 
immediately to your state office.  The sooner we get those members 
in the database, the sooner we can begin providing them with 
services and mailing them the Advocate. 
<P>
	Think of it:  a million NAMI members by the year 2000.  Can we 
do it?  You bet!
