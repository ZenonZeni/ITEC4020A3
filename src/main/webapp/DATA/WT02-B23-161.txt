<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Novel Chemically Bonded Phosphate Ceramics For Stabilizing Low-Level Mixed Wastes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>
Novel chemically bonded phosphate ceramics have been developed by 
acid-base reactions between magnesium oxide and an acid phosphate for 
stabilizing U.S. Department of Energy's low-level mixed waste streams.  
The acid-base reaction slurry formed a monolithic crystalline ceramic at 
room temperature.  Using these chemically bonded phosphate matrices, 
low-level mixed waste streams were stabilized that formed superior waste 
forms in a monolithic structure.  The final waste forms showed low open 
porosity and permeability, and one order of magnitude higher compression 
strength than the LDR.  Using this stabilization technology, operational 
size (55 gal.) monolithics were formed without losing physical 
integrity.  The hazardous contaminants in waste streams, such as RCRA 
heavy metals (Hg,Pb,Cd,Cr,Ni,etc) as well as radioactive elements (Ce as 
a surrogate of U and Pu), are chemically fixed by phosphate and 
physically encapsulated by phosphate ceramics.  These results on uranium 
were confirmed using uranium contaminated waste and waste water.
