<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Exact Solutions in Compressible Finite Elasticity</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong>The constraint of incompressibility has led to the discovery of several exact solutions in isotropic finite elasticity, 
most notably the controllable or universal solutions of Rivlin and others. Ericksen has examined the problem of finding all 
such solutions. He has also proved that there are no controllable finite deformations in isotropic compressible elasticity, 
except for homogeneous deformations.</p>
<p>In this talk some related questions are examined for three special classes of compressible isotropic elastic materials, one of 
which is the class of harmonic materials. Several closed form solutions, similar to the Rivlin solutions, are obtained. In 
particular, some classes of controllable deformations are addressed, with rather surprising results. For instance, it is shown 
that every harmonic scalar function generates a deformation that is controllable for harmonic materials. Finally, analysis of 
the controllability conditions suggests that the three classes of strain energy functions considered may be the only ones for 
which results of this type can be obtained.</p>
