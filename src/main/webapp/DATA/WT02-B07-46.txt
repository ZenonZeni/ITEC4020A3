(1) LANDMARK PRIVACY LEGISLATION INTRODUCED IN SENATE 
   
Bill Would Ensure Confidentiality of Medical Records

Landmark privacy legislation designed to protect the confidentiality of 
medical records was introduced today in the Senate by Senators Robert 
Bennett (R-UT), Robert Dole (R-KS), Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), Edward 
Kennedy (D-MA), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT).  If enacted, the "Medical 
Records Confidentiality Act" would create strong, comprehensive, privacy 
safeguards for the health data of all Americans.  Similar legislation 
has been introduced in the House by Representative Gary Condit (D-CA). 

As CDT Deputy Director Janlori Goldman stated during a press conference 
announcing the Introduction of the bill, "the Medical Records 
Confidentiality Act is desperately needed to close a gaping hole in 
current law that leaves peoples' most personal, sensitive information 
extremely vulnerable to abuse and misuse.  Strong protections are needed 
to safeguard peoples' health records as the information moves on the 
Global information highway.  Congress must seize the opportunity to pass 
this bill this session."  Towards this end, CDT has organized a broad 
range of privacy and consumer advocates, along with representatives from 
the health care and information industries to work towards its passage. 
(see attached letter below) 

The 'Medical Records Confidentiality Act' would:

*  Give people the right to see, copy, and correct their own medical 
   records; 

*  Limit disclosure of personal health information by requiring an 
   individual's permission prior to disclosure of his or her health 
   information by doctors, insurance companies, and other health 
   information 'trustees' (e.g.: researchers and public heath 
   departments);
        
*  Require the development of security guidelines for the use and 
   disclosure of personal health information; and
        
*  Impose strict civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations 
   of the Act, and provide individuals with a private right of action 
   against those who mishandle their personal medical information. 

CDT believes that strong uniform privacy rules for the handling of 
personal health data are critical to ensuring public trust and 
confidence in the emerging health information infrastructure.  Recent 
studies by the Institute of Medicine and the Office of Technology 
Assessment have shown that state laws are inadequate to protect peoples' 
health records, and that a federal law is needed to address this 
shortfall.

More information, including the text of the bill and a section-by-
section summary, are available from CDT's Health Information Privacy web 
page (URL:http://www.cdt.org/health_priv.html).

BACKGROUND -- THE NEED FOR MEDICAL RECORDS PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

The public is continually told that increased data collection, linkage 
and sharing is necessary to improve the quality of health care and 
reduce costs. Yet without giving individuals confidence that their most 
sensitive personal information will be protected, we risk falling short 
of these health reform goals.  If people don't trust the health care 
system to maintain the confidentiality of personal health information, 
they will be reluctant to fully participate.  A 1993 Lou Harris poll 
shows that a majority of Americans favors new, comprehensive legislation 
to protect the privacy of medical records.  The poll found that nearly 
50 million people believe their own medical records have been improperly 
disclosed.

It is no wonder individuals are nervous about the privacy of their 
health information.  One need only read the paper to learn about leaks 
of the sensitive health information of politicians, sports figures, and 
celebrities.  The ordeals of Representative Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) and 
the late tennis star Arthur Ashe expose the dire consequences that can 
occur when health information is wrongly disclosed.  Both Velazquez and 
Ashe suffered the disclosure of the most private intimate details of 
their lives -- a suicide attempt and HIV infection respectively -- to 
the world.  

Public figures are not the only victims of unauthorized, egregious 
disclosures. The average American also suffers from leaks of sensitive 
medical information.  Recently,  information on the HIV status, drug-
abuse history, and sexual practices of volunteers at an Ohio Health 
Department's AIDS prevention unit was wrongly disclosed.  Following 
another breach of confidential information, the office closed for 
retraining.  

Weak security also leads to unauthorized internal access and misuse of 
peoples' health records.  In March of this year, a 13-year-old daughter 
of a hospital clerk printed out the names and phone numbers of patients 
who had been treated at the University of Florida's Medical Center.  As 
a hoax, the 13-year old girl then contacted seven patients and 
erroneously told them they were infected with HIV.  After receiving one 
of these prank calls, a young girl attempted suicide believing she had 
the HIV virus.

CDT believes that the Medical Records privacy act is the most important 
privacy bill since the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 
(ECPA).  Furthermore, enacting health information privacy legislation is 
a critical first step in health care reform.  The Medical Records 
Confidentiality Act is supported by nearly everyone with a stake in the 
debate.  If passed, CDT believes the legislation will go a long way to 
restore the public's faith and confidence in the integrity and security 
of our nation's health care system.

NEXT STEPS:

The bill has been referred to the Senate Labor and Human Resources 
Committee (Chaired by Sen. Kassebaum (R-KS), a co-sponsor).  Committee 
hearings are scheduled for mid-November, and the bill is expected to be 
considered by the full Senate early in 1996.  Similar legislation is 
pending in the House (HR 435, sponsored by Rep. Condit (D-CA).

(2) CDT LED COALITION LETTER IN SUPPORT OF BENNETT BILL

October 20, 1995

Senator Robert Bennett
431 Dirksen Senate Office Bldg
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Bennett:

We write to express our appreciation and strong support for your efforts 
to enact a comprehensive privacy law to protect personal health 
information. We believe that safeguarding the privacy of peoples' health 
information is a necessary and critical component of health care reform. 
As the health system's infrastructure grows increasingly automated, it 
is essential that people have confidence that their participation in the 
health care system does not mean the loss of their privacy.

Although we are still in the process of resolving certain issues in the 
draft Medical Records Confidentiality Act developed by your office, a 
substantial consensus has emerged on the central policy of providing 
Americans uniform, strong confidentiality protection for their health 
information.

We look forward to continuing to work with you on this important bill.

Sincerely,
