<H1>WRECKS OF THE WORLD</H1>
Wrecks of the World is Mad-Dog Expeditions' newest venture in our continued quest to introduce sport divers to the realm of exploration.  We have chosen a series of locations that are not only outstanding dive sites but that also give us the opportunity to peer into history and learn something.  The expeditions involve some of the best wrecks in the world; involve real exploration and penetration while allowing us to train and certify you in the use of cutting edge diving equipment and methods.  
<P>We believe that there is not a wreck diver in the world, novice or experienced, who would not be excited and challenged by one of the trips we offer.  However, we have no desire to stop at these.  In the upcoming year, we will begin adding expeditions to Iceland, Norway as well as local East Coast events including guided dives on the Andrea Doria.<P>
 In response to many requests, Mad Dog Expeditions is now running annual Andrea Doria trips. Lying in 240 feet of cold, dark, offshore water, the Doria has been likened to the Everest of diving. The trip will be open to only experienced technical divers with mixed gas training. Trip prices are for two or three day expeditions and are for boat space only. As an additional option on some trips, first time participants may choose to have their dives guided by an expert Doria veteran. All other arrangements such as tank rental, gas fills and food may be made separately.<P>
<H2>Certifications:</H2>
<A HREF="../TRAINING/tech.html">Technical Diver Education</A> and Wrecks of the World programs.  These two programs work hand in hand to provide divers with the opportunity to undertake technical training while they explore some of the world's most exciting and challenging wrecks.  We will be offering all levels of ice, cave, wreck, NITROX and mixed gas certification. Technical training is through IANTD and recreational training is through PADI. The wrecks will vary from tropical dives within recreational limits to 300+ foot virgin sites in sub-Arctic conditions.  Experience and training will determine which ones are right for you.
