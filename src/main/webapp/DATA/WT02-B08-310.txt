<H1>Energy Difference between the Equator and the Poles</H1>
<p>
<font size = +1>
 The orientation of the Earth's poles relative to the Sun causes the difference in energy received at the Equator and the poles.

<p>
The average amount of incoming solar radiation decreases from the Equator to the poles. This is because the low latitudes (near the Equator) receive relatively large amounts of radiation all year, AND at high latitudes (near the poles), the more oblique angle of the Sun's rays together with long periods of darkness in the winter, result in a low average amount of received radiation.
