Governments Have Lost Control of International Trade

International trade is growing twice as fast as most
countries domestic GNP. Eastern Europe is rapidly moving
toward a market economy. Communications networks are the
railroads of the future; allowing value-added transactions to
move across borders unmeasured, and unrecorded.

Commerce Secretary Mosbacher has initiated a major policy
change to reduce the disincentives to export, created by an
export control policy which is out of touch with commercial
reality.  It is not a criticism that the change will be too
little too late, but the commercial reality is that the
European firms investing in Eastern Europe are not going to
compete in the marketplace with one hand tied behind their
back because of outdated concepts of export and technology
transfer controls.  Nor are they going to wait around for the
US government to give them permission.

Unless something changes Eastern Europe's direction (like
tanks in Tiananmen Square), economic activity will increase.
Eastern European countries are restricting exports of
subsidized consumer goods because it pays for an individual
to drive across a border to sell the goods for hard currency.
Small frequent export transactions are taking place because
human capital is available, even if financial capital is in
short supply.

To illustrate the amazing pace of change in Eastern Europe,
please note the following message from the new leadership in
East Germany (as quoted in a recent article by Craig Whitney
of the New York Times).  According to Mr. Gregory Gysi, the
new head of the East German Communist Party:

"I have never been in America in my life, but I think it is a
country that should not give up its responsibility for
Europe.  If the continued independence of the German
Democratic Republic is in the interests of stability in
Europe, then you should think about whether you want to leave
help for the G.D.R. up to a single neighbor country, and
thereby create dependency, or whether it wouldn't be better
to share the responsibility, to prevent the re-emergence of
Greater Germany,"

Referring to the possibility of unification, he added: "But
if so, then it should happen quickly-and simply."

Last June, 80 Socialist parties from around the world voted
in conference to reject socialism and adopt a system based on
market forces.  And barely six months later, the head of the
East German Communist party calls on the US to help complete
the post war process. The appeal of Eastern Europe is that
they want to buy what we have to sell, and despite a shortage
of hard currency they will take the necessary steps,
including mass emigration to obtain it.

Correction: The SED filing minimum will go to $2,500 when the
final rule is published in the Federal Register.

Our early information that the process of comments was
expected to be complete by January 1 was incorrect. Look for
a final rule with implementation at the earliest April
1st.  In the meantime, all export shipments where one
Schedule B number has a value greater than $1,500 requires
the filing of a completed Shipper's Export Declaration.

Housekeeping: Federal Register Notices usually appearing
monthly will reappear next month. "More than You Ever Wanted
to Know About Letters of Credit" is also scheduled to
reappear next month.

Europe 1992: Direction

Advisory Committee Report

The following is an abstract of the executive summary of the
Europe 1992 report of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy
and Negotiations (ACTPN).

Executive Summary

The European Community's program to create a single,
integrated market by the end of 1992 promises substantial
benefits to U.S. companies.  The program also presents
important challenges to the international trading system
whose current rules do not adequately address the intensely
competitive conditions of global markets.  The U.S.
government and the private sector have an interest in meeting
these challenges by seeking solutions to issues that now
serve to increase bilateral trade tensions.

The Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations
(ACTPN) has identified six such issues in which the U.S. has
a significant interest in influencing the direction of
change.  The ACTPN has also recommended actions the U.S.
government and the private sector need to take to address
current bilateral concerns.  In brief, the issues and
recommendations are:

Rules of Origin-The U.S. government needs to continue to
apply pressure on the EC to provide greater transparency,
clarity, and predictability in Community rule-making and
administration; to eliminate the use of local content in
settlements of antidumping charges; and to support the U.S.
goal within the Uruguay Round to reach a multilateral
discipline governing the rules of origin.

The private sector needs to build support among U.S.
companies for a harmonized system for determining origin; and
to establish a dialogue with companies in Europe aimed at
reducing the mutual reliance on trade law to restrict market
access.

Public Procurement-The U.S. government needs to press the EC
to extend fully competitive procedures for suppliers of non-
EC products; to seek time limits and conditions under which a
Member State may use "industrial adaptation" to postpone
market-opening changes; to allocate additional resources to
the GATT government procurement negotiations on the excluded
sectors; and to use the renegotiation of bilateral defense
agreements with the EC as leverage to achieve access to the
Community's largest areas of government procurement.

The private sector needs to press for the formulation and
acceptance of an effective remedies proposal providing
protection for injured suppliers; and to seek to influence
the ways in which procuring entities in Europe apply the 50%
value-added requirement and establish criteria for qualifying
and selecting suppliers, for evaluating bids, and for using
standards other than European standards.

Product Standards, Testing and Certification-The U.S.
government needs to formalize ad clarify recent agreements
reached with the European standards-setting organizations to
provide effective access for U.S. companies; to support the
commitment made by the EC that it will adopt international
standards wherever possible, rather than developing
specifically European standards; and to press for workable
structures in the EC and in the U.S. that will facilitate the
mutual recognition of test data and certification procedures.

The private sector needs to establish communications with
European subsidiaries, partners, distributors and customers
to keep abreast of standards-related developments in the
Community; and to participate more actively in the
international standards-setting process.

Technology Transfer-The U.S. government needs to assign the
highest priority to streamlining the list of multilaterally-
controlled products and technologies; to adopt standards for
resolving domestic jurisdictional disputes over the control
of goods and technology having both military and commercial
applications; to press the EC to indicate how it will ensure
a common standard of enforcement among the twelve Member
States; and to undertake a comprehensive review of U.S.
foreign policy controls to identify areas of unnecessary
duplication and inconsistency that encourage foreign firms to
design-out U.S. products and technology.

The private sector needs to provide advice to the U.S.
government on streamlining the control list; and to support
efforts to redirect current U.S. export control policy to
address changing technologies and East-West relations.

Local Content-The U.S. government needs to consult with the
EC and the Member States to ensure that the recently enacted
broadcasting directive is implemented in a flexible, non-
binding way.

The private sector needs to monitor developments in the
Member States, and to support the European groups opposed to
the introduction or strengthening of existing national
quotas.

Reciprocity-The U.S. government needs to continue its strong
support for the compromise language contained in the proposed
Second Banking Directive; and to monitor the EC's progress in
making similar changes in the draft directives on insurance
and investment services.

The report was adopted unanimously by ACTPN and represents
the consensus view of a broad spectrum of U.S.  industry and
labor.  It was submitted to Carla A. Hills, U.S.  Trade
Representative by James D.  Robinson III, ACTPN Chairman, and
Chairman and CEO of American Express Company; and Lawrence A.
Bosidy, Chairman of the ACTPN Task Force, and Vice Chairman
of the Board General Electric Company.

Relaxing Export Controls

A New Mosbacher Initiative

Commerce Secretary Mosbacher has gone on record saying that
there will be a "signifigant shortening" of the list of
commercially controlled items before the next Cocom meeting
in April. In an interview on the American Interests
televison show, Mr. Mosbacher said that "...we need to finish
our review, internally, in the US, get our groups together,
and see where we stand, going into Cocom together."

It has been observed that the other members of Cocom usually
follow the US lead in relaxing Cocom controls. It should be
remembered that last spring the official policy of Cocom was
announced as higher walls around fewer products. The delay
in implementing this policy position seems to come from a
dispute over which should come first, the higher walls or
fewer products.

The difference this year is the potential reunification of
Germany.

Following a meeting with his counterparts from East Germany,
Mr. Helmut Haussmann, the West German Economics Minister,
called for a relaxation of rules on East-West transfer of
technology to help give trade and industry cooperation
between East and West Germany "new perspectives". While this
may appear to be simply a German question, it raises the
issue of the viability of Cocom itself under the radical
restructuring of Eastern Europe.

Following the discussions, both East and West Germans were
reportedly satisfied with the talks which covered areas of
greater cooperation in medical technology, electronic control
systems, energy, and environmental technology. David Marsh
writing from East Berlin in the Financial Times said that
"Legal changes are expected to be made by both countries by
next February to allow joint ventures and to protect West
German investments in East Germany." In response to questions
about Cocom controls Mr. Hausman said that some rules
affecting areas like telecommunications and machine tools are
"senseless".

The Cocom process relies upon each member country enforcing
the agreed upon rules within its own borders.  President Bush
has acknowledged that the US "should and will review" the
Cocom process. Secretary of State Baker has said that "we
should rationalize the system to the extent that things that
are to some extent (italics added- ed.) available off the
shelf should not be locked up."  Deputy Secretary of State
Eagleburger is reported to have said that some dual use
technologies will no longer require prior approval, and that
"we understand that CoCom has to change."

Change first requires policy agreement, then implementation.

Two industry supported groups, looking at the process of
change from different perspectives have identified
essentially the same priorities and problems. (See the
following two articles.) The problem has been identified, and
for the most part the solution has been identified.

Before exporters see an actual reduction in the need to
obtain an export license, three obstacles remain:

1.  The Defense Department has not yet announced its
position, and with the rapid changes taking place in the
whole structure of European defense it is not clear when they
will have a new policy position.

2.  Writing new regulations, creating new lists, implementing
change takes time both in initiating the change, and then
going through the interagency review process.  Remember that
the process of shortening the list was also last year's
priority.

3.  Congress is about to re-authorize the Export
Administration Act. The National Academy of Sciences is due
to present another report. That which does not get done by
June is likely to have Congressional input by September,
further delaying the actual publication of new rules in the
Federal Register.

The difference, this year, is Eastern Europe and Western
Europe's integration.  Viscount Etienne Davignon, former EC
Commissioner of Industry, and current head of the European
Roundtable of Industrialists recently pointed out that Cocom
was a "procedure" which is not legally binding. As events in
Europe become clear, however, the procedure should be made
simpler and should become the "joint responsibility legally
of the EC" to reassure the US that Europeans are complying
with export controls.  While an interesting solution, the
problem is that the EC and Efta are currently re-negotiating
their trading relationship in light of 1992; a process which
is seen as the model for the EEC and Eastern Europe to enjoy
trade relations without full political relations.

The final text of the 12/15/89 NATO meeting ministerial
communique states : "In this regard, we support the progress
of rationalising existing export controls through a co-
ordinated approach that allows greater support for reform in
the East, and for Western investment in those countries while
protecting our security interests."  US Secretary of State
Baker was the US representative at those talks.  Agriculture
Secretary Yeutter, returning from a fact finding mission to
Eastern Europe, said that a process of building a
distribution infrastructure was necessary before foreign
direct investment would reap its full benefits.

Commerce Secretary calls for case by case evaluation of
higher tech sales to Eastern Europe; Soviets on hold.

When asked about the proposed sale of five very high-powered
Control Data Computers for contolling nuclear power plants on
NBC News, "Meet the Press" Commerce Secretary Mosbacher said
that they will "have to look at each item on a case-by-case
basis."  On a follow up question, Mr. Mosbacher said "but let
me say that we released middle technology, and we're going to
look to see whether it should go any higher than that.
Eastern European countries, yes. Soviet Union, would have to
be very careful."

In terms of specific direction for high-tech exports,
Secretary Mosbacher said "I think we will, particularly with
the Eastern European countries starting with Poland and
Hungary, open the door for higher technology as long as our
national security is protected.  We're willing to do it with
them because they have told us that they will protect us and
give us the opportunity to review (on site-ed.) what they're
doing with the higher-tech items."

On a very practical note, one knowledgeable observer
commented that with all those East Germans walking back and
forth across the border to West Berlin every day, did anybody
really think that all the packages they were carrying were
being inspected?  Defense Department policy notwithstanding,
soldiers at the border are also writing policy.

1992 and Technology Transfer

Recommendations

Recommendations on U.S. technology transfer policy by the
Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN)
to the U.S. Trade Representative.

The removal of EC internal frontiers increases the pressure
on the U.S. to accelerate efforts within Cocom toward the
development of common standards for national export control
systems.  To accomplish this goal, the U.S. will first have
to reduce the range products and technologies it currently
restricts, and further curtail its efforts to control
reexports of U.S.-origin goods and technology from Member
States, whether for reasons of national security or foreign
policy.

The danger is that, if the U.S. does not move rapidly enough
and cannot find common ground through Cocom then European
tolerance for U.S. export control policy may diminish further
in the context of a large, integrated market.  Were this to
happen it would likely increase European reluctance to
incorporate U.S. components in defense and high technology
products and undercut the ability of U.S. companies to
conduct cooperative research.  U.S. companies might then be
encouraged to conduct their R&D and production in Europe in
order to participate in EC and global markets.  European
companies with U.S. subsidiaries would also be discouraged
from conducting R&D in the U.S.

Thus, export control policies intended to safeguard the U.S.
could serve to weaken its technological lead.

The ACTPN therefore recommends that the U.S. government:

Assign the highest priority to streamlining the Cocom control
list.  The list needs to include only those items which are
of critical military importance to the USSR and its allies,
and are not available from non-Cocom sources.  This action
would assure the continued viability of the multilateral
control system and gain broad acceptance within Cocom of the
minimum necessary standards for national controls.  Serious
effort toward a significant rationalization of the control
list and removal of U.S.  unilateral controls will require a
high-level Administration policy initiative to assign
priority for action and overcome entrenched resistance within
U.S. government agencies.

Adopt standards for resolving jurisdictional disputes between
the Department of Commerce and the Departments of State and
Defense over the control of "dual-use" goods and
technology.  The lack of useful standards for determining the
boundary between the scope of the Export Administration Act
[EEA], administered by the Commerce Department, and the Arms
Export Control Act [AECA], administered by State and Defense,
has created a situation in which non-weapons items with
defense applications are incorporated within the U.S.
Munitions List and treated as weapons items.  The extension
of weapons export policies and procedures to non-weapons
exports in purely commercial transactions in the West results
in unreasonable restrictions on U.S. exports and further
encourages Western European companies to "de-Americanize"
their products.

Seek clarification from the EC regarding the conditions under
which individual Member States will continue to exercise the
right to restrict exports of Cocom-listed goods and
technology to other Member States after 1992.  While
alternative safeguards will probably be licensing may be kept
for munitions and nuclear technology items.  The U.S.,
therefore, should seek understandings with Member States on
how such controls will be administered.

Press the EC Commission to indicate how it will ensure a
common standard of enforcement.  Assurances are needed that
Cocom controls on exports to non-Cocom countries will be
effectively enforced throughout the Community.

Undertake a comprehensive review of U.S. foreign policy
controls to identify areas of unnecessary duplication and
inconsistency that encourage foreign firms to design-out U.S.
products and technologies.  Foreign policy controls are
currently imposed under a broad range of laws and
regulations, including the Foreign Assets Control Act, the
Trading With The Enemy Act, the International Economic
Emergency Powers Act, and the Export Administration Act.
Foreign firms attempting to comply with U.S. laws are faced
with an array of confusing and, at times, conflicting
requirements, most of which have some extraterritorial reach.
The competitive disadvantage created for U.S. firms is
compounded by the fact that other countries are less prone to
use export controls as an instrument of foreign policy and,
when they do, they do not apply such controls
extraterritorally.

U.S. companies interested in avoiding a post-1992 competitive
disadvantage in strategic technology trade need to monitor
carefully developments in the U.S. and the EC, and within
Cocom, and seek to influence the redirection of policy.

The ACTPN therefore recommends that U.S. industry:

Participate in the streamlining of the Cocom control list.
Industry participation in the statutorily-mandated technical
advisory committees should be upgraded and more aggressive in
promoting control list rationalization.  In addition, the
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 permits the
President to include representatives of industry as advisors
to the U.S. delegation at Cocom.  This increased role in
developing U.S. technology transfer policy is in keeping with
the key role played by industry representatives of other
Cocom countries in helping their countries prepare for
multilateral control list negotiations.

Support the initiation of a comprehensive study by the
National Academies of Sciences and engineering of current
U.S. export control policy. The study, which is required by
the 1988 Trade Act, is aimed at providing guidance for
renewal of the Export Administration Act, scheduled for 1990.
Among the major goals established for the study is the
development of dynamic and implementable principles for
determining which technologies should be subject to control
and at what point technological diffusion and/or obsolescence
dictates that a particular technology should be decontrolled.
The study will also develop proposals to harmonize U.S. and
Cocom procedures for dealing with cases of "foreign
availability," i.e., where identical functionally similar
technology exists beyond the reach of the Cocom countries.

Monitor the implementation of the export decontrol measures
included in the 1988 Trade Act.  Particular attention should
be paid to the removal of unilateral export controls for the
least sensitive goods and technology, i.e., those whose
export to controlled countries would require only
notification to Cocom member countries.

Background

The convergence of economic and political change in Europe is
placing new strains on the ability of the U.S. to
unilaterally control the flow of sensitive technologies that
could enhance Soviet military capabilities.  First, European
economic integration is helping create strong competitors
capable of challenging U.S. dominance of high technology
trade for the first time in the post war era.  Economic
integration is leading to the creation of large companies
capable ot achieving greater economies of scale and of
investing heavily in R&D.  This development coincides with
the growing insistence by European countries on nurturing an
indigenous high technology defense industrial base.

Second, although European political integration is still
distant, the EC has already taken its first, tentative steps
toward its goal of assuming a greater role in world affairs.
One of the important changes made by the 1987 Single European
Act was to incorporate the European Political Cooperation
process in the Treaty of Rome, the EC's governing agreement.
The Community has since begun to strengthen its political
structures, including those dealing with foreign policy.  The
key challenge in this arena is the coordination of policy
toward the Soviet Union and East Bloc countries.  European
attitudes on the issue of East-West relations have already
started to diverge from American attitudes, which are only
slowly emerging from the postwar consensus in which European
integration was seen primarily as a bulwark against Soviet
expansionism.

With the current Soviet and East Bloc leadership focused on
internal economic restructuring and pursuing trade and
defense initiatives with the West, most EC Member States are
increasingly persuaded that new realities have overtaken the
postwar consensus.  They argue that a new consensus among
alliance partners is needed, one that places greater emphasis
on multilateral coordination and is more open to East-West
trade.  In this context, Europeans view the continuing U.S.
preoccupation with restrictive East-West technology transfer
policies as misguided.  In particular, continued resistance
to reducing substantially the list of multilaterally
controlled goods and technology serves to undermine adherence
to multilateral constraints as well as inhibit U.S.-based
exporters from establishing trading relationships in Eastern
Europe.

The divergence between U.S. and EC approaches to technology
transfer may become more pronounced as European economic
integration proceeds and internal border controls are
eliminated.  Debate over alternative safeguards for
protecting sensitive technologies is just beginning within
the Community.  The debate is expected to center on the
setting of common minimum standards for licensing and
enforcement, and on the role of the Commission in formulating
and enforcing a borderless control policy.  The UK and
France, for example, have taken the position that they will
not relinquish to the Commission national controls on
munitions, nuclear and other sensitive military technologies;
Germany, on the other hand, has historically expressed the
desire to turn over most controls to the EC.

U.S. export control policies are currently conducted
bilaterally and are based on the U.S. assessment of the risk
of diversion of controlled goods and technology from that
country to the Soviet bloc and the People's Republic of
China.  Other factors considered are possible nuclear weapons
proliferation and foreign policy restrictions aimed at
specific nations.  Countries that participate in multilateral
control agreements, such as the Coordinating Committee
[Cocom], are given preferred treatment.  Cocom administers
three lists of controlled items: munitions, nuclear energy
and "dual-use (i.e., items with both commercial and military
application).  Cocom members include all the EC countries
(except Ireland), the U.S. Canada, Norway, Japan, Turkey and
Australia.  Switzerland and Austria are accorded full Cocom
privileges although they are not voting members.

"Dual-use" technology is increasingly importamt to the Soviet
Union which is intent on closing the existing gap with the
West through aggressive acquisition.  U.S. alliance partners
agree that the acquisition of leading Western "dual-use"
technologies represents a serious military threat and have
been supportive of U.S. attempts to strengthen Cocom.
However, they resent the U.S. tendency to resort to foreign
policy trade sanctions to penalize Soviet and other nations'
political behavior and the application of extraterritorial
controls that signal U.S. mistrust of its Cocom partners.

These strains within the alliance are exacerbated by the more
restrictive U.S. control regime.  A National Academy of
Sciences study in 1987 found that:

"U.S. national security export controls encompass more
products and technologies, are generally more restrictive,
and entail more administrative delays and shipper
uncertainties than those of the other major Cocom countries.
Only the United States requires foreign resellers, even in
countries that are our closest allies, to obtain the prior
approval of-or to account periodically to-the U.S.
government for reexports of U.S.-origin products, U.S.-origin
parts and components incorporated into foreign equipment, and
foreign equipment, and foreign products manufactured with
U.S.-origin technology.  These light of the fact that many
controlled products are available from or through non-Cocom
countries with few or no restrictions."

European countries, for example, have cited U.S.
extraterritorial controls on reexports of U.S.-origin goods
and technology as the reason for denying U.S. participation
in development of the European Fighter Aircraft [EFA} and for
eliminating or designing out U.S. parts and components in
projects supported by Member States.

The U.S. recently has acted to redress some of these
problems.  The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988
contains reforms which, when implemented, will reduce the
cost and competitive burdens of U.S. exports controls for
national security-controlled "dual-use" items, especially
where West-West trade is involved.  These reforms include:
(1) decontrolling the exports of less sensitive U.S.-origin
goods and technology to Cocom and other Free World countries;
(2) decontrolling  the reexport of U.S. parts and components
comprise less than 25% of the end-product.  In addition,
unilateral national security controls are to expire unless
the Department of Comerce determines that there is no other
comparable capability, or that negotiations for multilateral
control are underway.

The U.S. has also taken the initiative within Cocom to
propose upgrading the multilateral control system and to
create greater harmonization of national policies.  The U.S.,
as an incentive, has offered to go beyond the 1988 Trade Act
and remove all requirements for validated licensing of "dual-
use" exports and reexports to and among Cocom countries, and
to reduce substantially the list of multilaterally-controlled
goods and technology.  Cocom Member States have responded
favorably, indicating their willingness to upgrade their
enforcement control systems to an agreed-upon common
standard.  It now remains for the U.S. to initiate a
realistic reduction in the Cocom control list.

An upgraded Cocom system based on common standards would
simultaneously allow removal of U.S. control over reexports
from Cocom and permit a license-free internal market for the
EC.  These actions resolve much of the debate within the
Community over alternative safeguards for protecting
strategic goods and technology once internal borders are
eliminated.

Summary of the Issue

As part of its 1992 program, the EC plans to eliminate
internal customs border controls, and is likely to exert more
authority over the export control policies of Member States.
These changes could increase tensions between the U.S. and EC
over their differing approaches to technology transfer
further justifying European perceptions that U.S. policy is
out of step with new political and economic realities.  If
the U.S. fails to reduce or remove its unilateral controls
over the reexport of U.S.-origin products to third countries,
its company may find it more difficult to export to, and
cooperate with, European firms and governments.  Europeans
are increasingly unwilling to include U.S.-origin goods and
technology in their end-products because of these reexport
controls.  Increased rejection of U.S. goods and technology
by European customers could also discourage both U.S. and EC
firms from conducting research and development in the U.S.

The U.S. should assign higher priority to substantially
reducing the list of multilaterally controlled goods and
technology.  This action would signal the U.S. commitment to
developing and implementing common standards for national
controls among the member countries of Cocom.  Such common
standards must be sufficient to allow removal of U.S.
extraterritorial control over reexports from Cocom countries,
as well as permit a license-free internal market for the
Community.

The U.S. should also press the EC to indicate the extent to
which it will exert authority over the control policies of
Member States, and how it will ensure a common standard of
enforcement.

A Survey of Export Finance Services

Banks in Export Finance - Part I

Servicing the East

By Heather L. McCulloch

The demand for export finance among American companies is
growing as the ranks of new exporters expand, and experienced
players become more active in foreign markets.  While many of
the larger banks are still reluctant to serve any but their
largest customers, others have recognized the potential
business of the expanding market of growing exporters.

In the past, new or infrequent exporters have lost business
to foreign buyers which demanded credit terms.  Considering
the small size of potential shipments and small companies
lack of collateral to support working capital or accounts
receivable financing, many companies did not feel it was
worthwhile to seek credit from reluctant bankers.  Today,
these companies see foreign markets as bearing the greatest
growth potential, so their demand for export finance has
mushroomed.

The following article is the first in a series on banks in
export finance.  The series, based on interviews with trade
finance specialists in banks across the country, will explore
the activities of those banks which are gaining a reputation
for servicing the needs of local exporters.  (The Exporter
welcomes your comments and suggestions as we progress from
the East to West coast in the next issues.)

While many of the larger money center banks have closed down
or strictly limited their trade finance departments in recent
years, several regional and super-regional banks on the
eastern seaboard have given trade finance top priority.
This first article focuses on five east coast banks which are
becoming recognized for their expertise in the market.  They
include the Bank of Boston and Bay Banks in Massachusetts,
Philidelphia National Bank (PNB) in Pennsylvania, Maryland
National Bank (MNB) in Maryland, and Citizens and Southern in
Georgia.

The trade services department of the Bank of Boston provides
exporters with more than the traditional collections and
letter of credit services.  While other banks have pulled out
of the market, Bank of Boston has continued to provide a
diversity of trade finance services for large corporate
clients as well as small and medium-sized exporters.

The majority of the bank's exporting clients have
traditionally been frequent exporters with established buyer
relationships; but the export finance group is beginning to
address the growth potential in the companies which are new
to exporting, or which are beginning to increase their export
sales.

In order to provide such financing without increasing their
international exposure, the Bank of Boston's trade finance
specialists have been trying to work more closely with
government programs to help companies which are small and/or
new to exporting.  In the past, the extensive paperwork
involved discouraged many banks from participating in the
government programs.  The Bank of Boston is trying overcome
this hurdle by developing a reporting package that will
expedite administrative procedures to increase the cost-
effectiveness of lending for smaller transactions.

The bank is interested in doing more accounts receivable
financing for sales covered by Eximbank or FCIA.  They have
also been active in providing buyer credits, a direct loan to
a foreign client to support a customer's sale, again with
Exim or FCIA coverage.

Bay Banks, of Boston, also sees potential in the expanding
middle market.  The bank is trying to figure out ways to use
government working capital and accounts receivable financing
guarantee programs more effectively, so they too can become
more active in providing credit to smaller, or less frequent,
exporters.

One solution reducing the paperwork has been to try to work
more closely with MIFA-Massachusetts Industrial Finance
Agency-the state's export development agency.  MIFA
facilitates the processing of Exim and FCIA applications by
screening companies and providing administrative services in
the application procedure.  (For more information, see
article on state agencies in this issue) Still, according to
the bank's trade finance specialists, the number of bankable
transactions under these programs is still disappointing.

One problem with using government programs is the fact that
many new exporters are start-up companies.  Exim requires
that companies be in existence for three years before they
are eligible for their programs.  Trade finance specialists
within the bank often find this requirement to be a
constraint on the bank's lending because they often see young
companies which would merit the bank's support if Exim were
more lenient.

For medium term lending (mainly for larger transactions of
more than 180 days), the bank is becoming more active in
arranging "supplier credits"-a loan to the buyer, arranged by
the seller.  To minimize its own exposure, the bank works
closely with Exim to arrange a guarantee of the loan, or with
forfaiting houses, which will purchase or participate in the
credit obligation.  For short term financing, the bank may
use the services of an international factoring house, which
will purchase the exporter's foreign receivables at a
discount.

Moving down the coast, Philidelphia National Bank(PNB) is a
growing 'super-regional' which sees trade finance as an
integral part of relationships with corporate clients.  Since
the bank's trade finance unit is a "shadow unit", rather than
a profit center, they are willing to work on all sizes of
transactions.  However, the focus of the bank is on servicing
the needs of its traditional corporate clients, rather than
seeking out new business amongst growing exporters.

PNB bank is willing to provide buyer credits with FCIA
insurance or an Exim guarantee.  They are not involved in
international factoring, but will participate in the
forfait market, if needed to complete a transaction.  PNB has
also been involved in the arrangement of countertrade
transactions, though they will not take title to the goods.

MNC International Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Maryland National Bank.  Focusing on merchant banking, MNC is
more deal-driven than commercial banks.  With a customer base
which stretches across the United States,  this transaction-
oriented, rather than relationship-oriented approach helps
the bank to meet the needs of a diverse customer base.

MNC is among the top ten users of Exim guarantee programs in
the area of post-export finance.  In structuring export
finance, MNC's trade specialists try to respond as quickly as
possible to the customer's needs.  A large percentage are
exporters of capital goods, so no transaction is "standard".
In the area of pre-export finance, the bank is active in the
provision of working capital lending to small companies,
again, it is one of the largest users of Eximbank's programs
(this time for working capital guarantees).

Non-traditional activities of the bank, include growing
cooperation with Maryland National World Trade (formed in
1983, the company was dormant for a period but is now
experiencing a revival), and in a number of countertrade
transactions.  MNC is seeking to expand its business with new
exporters, on a deal-by-deal, or on-going basis.

Citizens and Southern Bank in Atlanta, Georgia, has been
actively providing export finance services for the last 30
years.  While the international departments of money-center
banks were focusing on direct lending in the 1970's, Citizens
and Southern continued to emphasize trade-related lending.
The bank emerged largely unscathed from the third world debt
crises.  Consequently, they have been able to continue to
accept country risk from countries in which other banks have
completely withdrawn.

Citizens and Southern has one of the largest international
departments in the southeast.  It is in the process of
merging with Sovran Bank of Virginia, which is also known for
its trade finance expertise.  On the domestic side, the
bank's focus is on fulfilling the trade finance needs of its
established customers, but they will accomodate the needs of
smaller, or less frequent, exporters if this service is part
of a broader commercial relationship.

The bank has followed the trade finance patterns of its
customers, with a traditional focus on sales to Latin
America.  They are able to accept short term country risk in
countries such as Chile, Brazil and Mexico which other banks
have been unable to do.

To service the needs of its middle market clients, the bank
has developed strong expertise in factoring operations.
Factoring is typically used in transactions of 120 days or
less, and takes two forms, guaranteeing of the receivable at
a nominal rate, and advancing against the guaranteed
receiveable. For the discounting of medium term notes, the
bank is not, itself, an active player in the a-forfait
market.  However, they will consult customers on the
availability of forfaiting services, using access to
forfaiting houses and other banks in the market.

The Roundtable On Credit Conditions

Developments in Africa

Namibia

Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, is moving towards
independence.  At the moment, Namibia is still governed by
the Republic of South Africa.  Following recent elections,
however, the former German and British colony will soon be
preparing the law of the newly independent nation.

The UN General Assembly terminated South Africa's mandate for
Namibia in 1966.  The Republic continued to occupy and
administer the territory in spite of a series of UN
resolutions which sought to establish Namibian independence.
Movement towards granting independence, as set out in the UN
Resolution 435 in 1978, was also stymied by armed conflict in
neighboring Angola.

On December 1988, a tripartite peace accord between South
Africa, Angola, and Cuba established a timetable for the
phased withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and called upon
the UN to effect movement towards Namibian independence.  The
polling for the Constituent Assembly just took place.  These
elections were a contest between the South West Africa
People's Organization (SWAPO) and the Democratic Turnhalle
Alliance.  Real independence for Namibia is scheduled for
April of 1990.

On the economic side, mining activity is the mainstay of the
Namibian economy representing about one-quarter of GDP and
providing some three-quarters of the territory's foreign
exchange earnings.  Of particular importance are the rich
deposits of alluvial diamonds, of which Namibia produced
approximately one million carats in 1987 alone.

The Rossing open-pit mine produces some 3,600 tons of uranium
annually.  This output is primarily used for generating
electricity.  Other notable resources include copper, zinc,
lead, tin, gold, silver, and semi-precious stones.
Independence should result in the end of South African
sanctions, thereby opening up export markets and promoting
the development of the territory's resource potential.

Some 70% of the population derive their livelihood from the
agricultural sector, mostly employed in subsistence farming.
Because of the arid climate and poor land quality, the sector
is dominated by extensive livestock husbandry, exporting meat
and sheep pelts.  Wheat and maize are the principal arable
crops.

Work is now underway to supply water from the Okavango River
in the north to other parts of the country which should boost
agricultural production.  Upon independence, Namibia hopes to
implement a 200-mile exclusive economic zone to conserve its
fishing resources, and it will develop fish processing
facilities.  With a small domestic market and close ties with
the South African economy, Namibia's manufacturing sector
accounts for only 5% of the GDP.  It produces a limited range
of consumer goods and is undertaking some export processing.
Opportunities for growth are largely in import substitution,
especially in foodstuffs, and in domestic processing of
primary products.  In fiscal 1989-90 the budget deficit will
most likely increase to some 214 million South Africa Rand.
This reduction can be largely attributed to substantial South
African aid reductions.

The outlook for this sparsley populated, predominantly desert
territory is that the country will confront major challenges
in its emergence as an independent nation.  Developed
countries, notably Great Britain and West Germany, have
planned additional assistance, but despite Namibia's
political autonomy, it is likely to remain economically
dependent on South Africa for the foreseeable future.

Ivory Coast

The Ivory Coast was formerly a part of the French West
Africa.  It became independent in 1960 under the leadership
of President Houphouet-Boigny.  Now over eighty years old, he
was confirmed in office for another 5 years in October 1985.
The President heads the unity party, Parti Democratique de la
Cote d'Ivoire.  The constitution provides that, in the event
of the death or resignation of the Head of State, the
President of the National Assembly will take power for an
interim period with an obligation to call new elections
within 90 days.

The Ivory Coast always had a free market economy, and between
1973 and 1980 GDP increased on average by 6.8% per year.
However, per capita income amounted to only US$ 864 in 1988,
partly the result of austerity programs imposed by the IMF
and the World Bank.  The good harvests of 1985 and 1986
improved commodity prices, fuelling a short-lived recovery.
However, the subsequent fall in both commodity prices and the
dollar, together with a reduction in it cocoa crops in 1988,
resulted in liquidity problems for the country.

The banking system of the Ivory Coast came under pressure at
the end of 1988 when resources were required to finance crops
to the detriment of other sectors of the economy.  Exporters
were unable to repay crop credits while credit had to be
restricted because of the increase in external debt
repayments.  As a result of the liquidity crunch, foreign
bank subsidiaries obtained funds from head offices, while
local banks found it increasingly difficult to meet customer
withdrawals.  As some banks closed, others were reorganized
or merged.  (It should be noted, that the local currency, the
CFA franc, is fully convertible with the Franch franc.)

Agriculture in the Ivory Coast generates about 30% of the GDP
and employs approximately 80% of the labor force of the
country.  Agricultural products account for more than three-
quarters of export earnings.  Since the end of the 1970s, the
Ivory Coast has been the world's biggest producer of cocoa.
The country is also the third largest producer of robusta
coffee.  These two crops together account for about one half
of export earnings.

The coffee crop reportedly declined again in the 1988/89
season, to 4.2 million sacks from 4.55 million in the
previous year.  This decline reflects the ageing of plants
and lower guaranteed prices than for cocoa.  The
International Coffee Organization export quota was reduced to
3.6 million sacks in 1988/89, notably because of Western
consumer preference for arabica.  A record cocoa crop of some
750,000 tons was recorded in 1988/89 against 630,000 tons in
1987/88, an increase of 20%.

Cocoa and coffee are largely produced on small-scale
plantations which employ foreign labor and sell their crops
to Caisse de Stabilisation et de Soutien des Prix des
Productions Agricoles (CSSPPA), the State marketing agency,
at prices fixed by the government.  Since 1987, however, the
local cost of cocoa, of about CFA francs 600 per kilo, has
exceeded the world price by about 50%.  With the government
no longer able to make up the difference, planters have had
to sell crops at half the guaranteed price or to accept
purchase vouchers in lieu of payment.

In order to broaden the agricultural base, cotton is being
promoted.  In 1986/87 the Ivory Coast became the third-
largest cultivator among African cotton producers.  Exports
of tropical fruit and rubber have also increased
significantly.  Rubber production is expected to double by
1990, making the Ivory Coast Africa's largest producer.  Rice
output has also been increased considerably and self-
sufficiency has been virtually achieved in pork and poultry.
Wheat imports have been held down despite continuing high
population growth rate.  The production of yams and manioc
fell, by 50% and 20% respectively in 1986/87.

Fish production meets 60% of the domestic needs. Abidjan is
Africa's largest tuna fishing port, accounting for almost a
quarter of the total Atlantic tuna catch.  The total area of
exploitable timber is estimated at only one million hectars,
against 15.6 million at the start of the century, because of
the excessive clearing of forest land.

Industry, including mining and construction, accounts for
about 13% of the GDP, but employs only around 4% of the labor
force.  Agricultural and foodstuff processing account for
about 40% of output, with coffee and cocoa the major sectors.
Some 40 firms produce textiles.  Wood is processed by about
65 firms that depend on the level of activity in the local
building trade, which accounts for 3% of the GDP.  Over two-
thirds of industry is lcoated in and around the commercial
capital of Abidjan.

The Ivory Coast remains a net importer of energy.  Following
the rapid introduction of thermal turbines after the drought
of 1983 to 1985, thermal power stations now account for 60%
of total energy.  The possibility of exploiting rich natural
gas deposits in the coastal region has been considered, but
relatively lower oil prices have restrained the earlier
enthusiasm for using gas instead of oil to fuel generators.

On the financial side, total expenditures for 1989 have been
set at CFA francs 645 billion, an increase of 1.25 from the
previous year.  This amount includes an increase of 1.4% in
operating expenditure to CFA francs 500 billion.  The special
investment and equipment budget (BSIE), of CFA francs 145
billion, has been increased by 1% and is being devoted mainly
to major agriculture programs (39% of the budget), housing
and urban development (11%), and training (8%).

Budget spending, particularly under the public sector's
consolidated budget, could turn out to be substantially
higher than forecast.  The public sector's current revenue
should amount to CFA francs 880 billion, from which CSSPPA's
forecast deficit of CFA francs 180 billion must be deducted.
Current expenditure is expected to total CFA francs 700
billion.  Including the BSIE, which has local debt of CFA
francs 50 billion and external debt of CFA francs 470
billion, total expenditure will total around CFA francs 1,370
billion.  With CSSPPA's cumulative arrrears and government-
guaranteed loans of CFA francs 360 billion, the public
sector's financing requirement will increase to CFA francs
850 billion (US$2.7 billion), or 28% of the GDP in 1989 and
to fall to about CFA francs 500 in 1990.

With approved or anticipated external funding of about CFA
francs 475 billion, about CFA francs 140 billion for 1989
will have to be generated through domestic measures such as
higher taxes, a reduction in "presidential levies", and a cut
in guaranteed producer prices, none of which will be easy to
achieve in the country.   As a result of this, adjustment
will be spread over several years if the austerity policy is
maintained.

With the Ivory Coast the world's largest cocoa producer, and
because the quality of the bean is of the highest grade, the
President adopted a policy in 1988 of holding back exports in
an unsuccessful attempt to raise world prices significantly.
Almost 90% of the crop has reportedly been sold but for only
a portion of the prices demanded.  An agreement reached
with a commercial company in December 1988 provided for the
removal of 400,000 tons of cocoa in 1988/89.  Of this amount
125,000 tons was applicable to 1988, half of which was
stocked in European ports for two years.  The selling price
was reduced to the world price for the Ivory Coast cocoa (CFA
francs 500 per kilo) by waiving a removal tax of CFA francs
100 per kilo. In June of 1989, a contract for the removal of
280,000 tons of cocoa, the balance of the 1987-89 crop years,
was signed with another commercial concern.

Despite the generally unfavorable trend in commodity prices
in 1989, with cocoa prices falling by 10% and cotton prices
by 7.5% (the exception was coffee with a 4.5% price
increase), a rise in export volume should increase export
earnings by 12% to US$2.7 billion.  Imports are not expected
to increase because of the foreign exchange shortage and the
implementation of the IMF-agreed austerity program.  One
aspect of this program is expected to be a fall in the
guaranteed producer price for cocoa to CFA francs 250 per
kilo from CFA francs 400.

The rise in the trade surplus to US$1.1 billion, an increase
of 42%, should offset the adverse impact of higher
international interest rates.  The current account deficit is
expected to fall to US$1 billion from US$1.3 billion in 1988
but, at the equivalent of 10.5% of GDP, it will remain high.

Principal and interest arrears are in the vicinity of CFA
francs 470 billion, while payments to the IMF and the World
Bank remain behind schedule.  Debt is increasing rapidly.
According to the World Bank, it amounted to US$13.5 billion
at the end of 1987, a figure which includes guaranteed long-
and medium-term public debt of US$8.4 billion.  According to
some estimates, total outstanding debt at end-1989 could
amount to US$15.5 billion if short-term debt is included.
This implies a debt servicing of about US$2.9 billion, or 86%
of foreign exchange revenues prior to rescheduling.

France is the major trading partner of the Ivory Coast,
accounting for 35% and 16% respectively of the country's
imports and exports.  Nigeria, the Netherlands, and Japan
each provide about 6% to 7% of imports, while the major
export markets, apart from France, are the United States
(12%), West Germany(10%), and Italy(8%).

Latest Information on the Ivory Coast: Responding to the
demands of creditors for deep cuts in the public-sector
spending, the country's President has radically streamlined
the government.  Ten of the overall 39 ministeries were
abolished.  In general, credit terms extended to the country
show all terms, from open account to strict letter of credit
transactions.  The delay on lenient terms has been longer in
recent months, and some exporters have to wait several weeks
for payment.  Overall, payments are still being made.
Exporters should definitely check the creditworthiness of
their customers, both old and new, to avoid any surprises.

State Export Development Agencies

States Pick Up the Slack in Export Finance

By Heather L. McCulloch

The notion that small business in America is an untapped
source of exports which, once mobilized, will turn around
America's trade deficit is, today, a common perception.
Though the theory has yet to be proven, state administrators
of newly established export finance agencies are trying their
best to push local companies into international markets.

The Reagan administration drastically reduced federal funding
for Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) programs, recommending that
exporters turn to the private sector for export financing.
Unfortunately, in the wake of the third world debt crisis and
the resulting increase in capital adequacy requirements;
American commercial banks were simultaneously retreating from
trade finance, particularly for their smaller customers.

Small and medium-sized American companies are making progress
in tackling foreign markets; but their lack of access to
export finance remains a major barrier to overseas sales.
Small or infrequent exporters face many barriers to obtaining
credit from commercial banks.  It is harder for smaller
companies to obtain working capital financing for domestic
instances; but when it comes to cash flow being dependent on
foreign receivables, the banks' concerns about
creditworthiness are multiplied.

The majority of U.S. exports are sold on a cash or short term
credit basis (less than 90 days), but exporters are
increasingly demanded to extend credit terms in competitive
foreign markets.  In many cases where exporters can not
extend credit, the sale is lost to competiters who can.
In some states, few or no banks are willing to provide post-
shipment export financing, even for their largest customers.
Finally, smaller exporters have difficulties dealing with
FCIA insurance programs because the administrative costs bite
into the profit margin of a small shipment, and private
insurance for small transactions is typically hard to come
by.

State governments have begun to respond to the gap in
financing between the private sector and the federal
government.  According to a recent survey by First Washington
Associates; as of June 1989, export-financing legislation had
been passed in 31 states and 24 states have operational
programs.  Most state export development programs have the
specific goal of helping small and medium-sized non-exporters
to enter foreign markets.  Unlike export credit agencies in
other countries; they are designed and operated to meet local
needs, independent of federal management or financing.

A diverse array of state programs has been developed, ranging
from pre- and post-shipment lending to state guarantees,
insurance and financial advice.  Some state agencies have
limited their involvement to counseling and documentary
assistance.  For example, the Massachusetts Industrial
Finance Agency (MIFA) provides export finance counseling and
assistance in administrative aspects of Exim and FCIA loan
applications.

Other programs, like Minnesota's Export Finance Authority
(MEFA), play a larger role in the transaction.  MEFA
encourages bank involvement by arranging export insurance and
loan guarantees, as well as providing Eximbank packaging
assistance and financial counseling.  MEFA supported $4.3
million in export sales last year.

The ultimate success of the state programs lies in their
ability to bring the private sector back into export finance.
Illinois was a pioneer in working with commercial banks to
provide direct loans to exporters.  In 1984, the state passed
legislation to create the Illinois Export Development
Authority (IEDA), a state export finance program.  The
program provides fixed-rate loans to local exporters, whose
exports have a minimum state content of 25%.  The loans will
cover 90% of an export transaction, with a maximum
transaction size of $500,000.

The California Export Finance Office (CEFO) is one of the
most successful state export finance agencies.  The program
has supported over $160 million of export sales since its
inception.  The majority of the office's activities have
since been focused on providing pre-export guarantees for
working capital loans.  For a guarantee fee of 1%, the agency
will guarantee 85% of the export transaction, to a maximum of
$350,000.  The program may soon be moving into post-shipment
finance lending.  Administrators of the fund are currently
experimenting with the possibility of a foreign accounts
receivables lending program.

Some state agencies have also been playing a more direct role
in providing direct working capital loans to support exports.
The New Jersey Economic Development Authority recently began
to offer a one-year revolving line of credit of up to
$100,000 for state exporters.  The line will cover the
exporters costs of materials and production for foreign
sales.  A confirmed letter of credit from the buyer or
coverage by the Foreign Credit Insurance Association is a
prerequisite for state participation.

State and local governments have also begun to work together
with the federal government to bring Eximbank programs down
to the level of city government.  In 1987, experimental
Eximbank City/State Agency Cooperation Programs were launched
in three states and three cities.  The programs, designed as
distribution vehicles for federal export finance programs,
offer training for state and city personnel by Exim staff
members.

The City of Los Angeles has implemented the program in a
particularly innovative manner.  Loans to local exporters are
approved by the city; guaranteed by the state program or
Eximbank; and financed by a $15 million credit line provided
by Imperial Bank, an L.A.-based regional bank.  Initiated in
1987, the program is the largest municipal export finance
program in the nation.

Despite the demonstrated success of state programs in
bringing new exporters into the market, critics of the
lack of federal participation argue that the fragmented
approach is not adequate to remedy America's trade imbalance.

Howard Lewis, vice president of the National Manufacturers
Association, is skeptical of the federal government's
tendency to leave export finance problems to the states.  L.
Fargo Wells, head of the California Export Finance Office,
emphasizes the fact that state programs are meant to
supplement, not replace, Eximbank programs.  States are
restricted by size, budgetary restrictions as well as
political realities, so they can not be expected to solve
America's deficit woes single-handedly.

With current budget considerations, however, it is unlikely
that the Bush administration will revitalize a currently
'defunded' Eximbank.  By design or default, the state
agencies remain at the forefront of public sector export
finance.

Export Development, Southern-Style

Southern States Adopt Unified Strategy

The Southern Growth Policies Board held a key conference in
New Orleans on December 8-9, 1989 to set an international
agenda for the southern states from 1990 to 1995.  Attending
were over 70 high ranking representatives of twelve southern
state governments, legislators, regional organizations,
universities, research organizations, the federal government,
and others from the public and private sectors.  Uppermost on
the agenda was the subject of how the region could encourage
the growth of exports and international investment using a
variety of new programs and policy approaches.

Export finance and other trade promotion program were a
special focus of attention.  The conference noted the
limitations of existing statistics on international trade,
discussed the major issues affecting export success, and
agreed on a variety of research projects which would help
southern legislatures and administrative agencies decide
which policies and programs could be most helpful to their
states.

The Southern Growth Policies Board will play a catalytic and
coordinating role in seeking to implement the research
projects endorsed by the conference and will share the
results between all members.  This is the first time that a
regional grouping of states has gotten together for the joint
planning of comprehensive research and development efforts
that will lead to increased international trade and
investment.  In the past this had always been done by the
individual states with consequent duplication of effort and
suboptimal utilization of the results.

The Services Trade Deficit

House Export Task Force

Subcommittee Hearing Summary

By Craig Pena, staff member of the House Export Task Force.

The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International
Economic Policy and Trade recently conducted a hearing on the
services trade deficit.  The deficit was the first of its
kind in thirty years.

Chairman Sam Gejdenson, in his opening statement, explained
that there are two components to the service trade balance,
investment and sales.  Investment, the larger of the two
components, compares the earnings of foreigners' investments
in the U.S. with the earnings of Americans' investments
overseas.  That portion of the service balance is currently
in deficit.  The second factor of the services trade balance
is sales performance.  Here the U.S. ran a $5 billion surplus
in the second quarter of 1989.

The purpose of Friday's hearing was, according to the
Chairman "to find out the story behind America's newest
deficit." Comments from some of the witnesses are as follows:

From C. Fred Bergsten. Director, Institute for International
Economics:

1.  Foreign investment in the U.S. has become greater than
U.S.  investment abroad.  However, on a per dollar basis,
U.S. investments overseas still outperform foreign
investments in the United States.  (Generally the foreign
assets held by the U.S. are older investments which are
reaching a maximum yield.  When the foreign held assets
mature, the services trade deficit can be expected to
worsen.)

2.  To alleviate the federal deficit, Bergsten argues that a
tax increase will have to exist and recommends a value added
tax (VAT) or an across the board consumption tax.


From The Honorable Linda Powers.  Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Services, United States Department of Commerce:

1.  The services trade deficit of the past provided a
substantial "offset to the merchandise trade deficit."

2.  "Lack of comprehensive trade data on services is indeed
frustrating to U.S. government efforts to formulate and
execute trade policy for the service sector".  Quite often
many "service trade and income flows do not pass (sic)
generally pass through gateways where they can be easily
counted.  Accordingly, the system of collecting data on
services trade must be based largely on surveys of service
companies."

3.  Powers states that "true traded services have not moved
into a deficit but show a growing surplus with exports
exceeding imports by approximately 6.8 billion dollars during
the second quarter of 1989."  Of these "true services" it is
travel and transportation that acquired the sizeable
deficits.  These deficits are offset by growing surpluses
from technology licensing and other royalties and licensing
fees which bring the entire "true services" balance to
surplus.

4. "A recurring problem for exported-minded U.S.  service
providers is the persistence of a multitude of foreign trade
barriers to services.  One example is the European
Community's television broadcast directive...  [However], the
development of trade rules and procedures for the progressive
elimination of services barriers is a major component of the
Uruguay Round trade negotiations."

From The Honorable Richard Self, Deputy Assistant U.S.  Trade
Representative:

1. Self agreed with Powers that there is no deficit in the
U.S. services sector.

2. "...the problem reflected by the data appears to stem from
increased foreign investment in the U.S. rather than poor
performance of the service sector."

3. "It is the role of the U.S. government to establish and
maintain a suitable international climate to enable U.S.
service industries to gain access to markets and compete
fairly."

From Gordon Cloney. President, International Insurance
Council:

1. "International Trade Statistics for insurance are
fragmentary because insurance transactions between countries
do not pass through the equivalent of a customs house where
recording can take place."

2. Cloney lists three types of trade discrimination practices
faced by the insurance industry:

a. The practice of simply closing a market to the U.S.
insurer by nationalization or domestication of the market."

b. "...making it impossible to set up, license and organize
an effective establishment to operate in the market."

c. Those [practices] which cripple the commercial operations
of the foreign insurer even when they are admitted and
permitted to organize.

3. "The U.S. must be sure it provides its international
insurers with as good a commercial base for global operations
as possible.  Industry and government should cooperate to
identify and reduce or eliminate domestic disincentives to
doing an international business from the U.S.  Our state
regulators are beginning to pursue this worthwhile
objective."

All witnesses, while having varied points of view, agree that
as time progresses it will be the ever growing income from
U.S. assets held by foreigners that will lead to a further
deterioration of the services trade balance in the future.

Governors Create Export Database

The NGA has created a database that will be useful for
tracking the growth of exports state by state. While it
does not answer the question of how many exporters there are
in each state, the new database does allow states to track
the growth of export industries in their state year by year.

This database is necessary because the Census Bureau does not
have the funds to provide trade statistics below the national
level, in fact, the only detailed statistics are from the
1987 trade year. In 1989, the Shipper's Export Declaration
database of transactions will be compared with the Census of
Manufacturers' database of establishments to indentify the
number and type of exporters in each state, at the four digit
SIC level.  Even so, it will not be possible to update the
Census Bureau data.

The new service being offered by the National Governors
Association, in cooperation with DRI, will make it possible
to distribute national trade statistics to state activity at
the more detailed three digit level SIC classification,
through the use of an input/output table. The service is
called Expolink.

Expolink contains the value of US exports to more than 141
countries by state-by 3 digit SIC industry-for the fifty
states and the District of Columbia.  Estimated from several
sources, including the US Commerce Department's Origin of
Movement data series, Expolink contains the files of total
exports as well as a breakdown by mode of transportation (air
and sea).

EDIA - 21st Conference

National EDI Systems Conference and Exhibit

The Maturation of EDI

By R.T.Crowley

Once again, as they have for the last score of years, the
members of the EDI community made their annual pilgrimage to
Washington, DC to participate in the TDCC: The Electronic
Data Interchange Association's two-and-a-half day conference.
Actually, as any regular attendee to this event knows all too
well, the conference itself may last only two-and-a-half
days, but the other related meetings and happenings scheduled
by other groups in conjunction with it stretch things out to
a full week.  While many of the usual rites of this regular
week long "mating season" of EDI were observed, there were a
number of notable new twists and additions that point the way
to the future evolution of EDI as we now know it.

I am fond of saying that to be involved in EDI is to be
passionately in love with change.  EDI represents a
monumental change to the way that mankind will communicate
and do business, but EDI itself is changing in many ways.
The first TDCC conference, twenty-one years ago, consisted of
a little less than one-hundred fifty individuals who came
together to discuss the, then "brand new", technology of EDI.
Most attendees were either traffic managers from transport
companies or production managers from manufacturing companies
with a small sprinkle of computer professionals from the same
companies to advise them about the technical aspects of the
discussions.  Over the intervening years, the cast of at-
tendees has undergone a subtle change which was quite
apparent in the over two thousand people who came to
Washington, DC this year.

Traditionally, in our society, the twenty-first year
represents the point of passage from adolescence to
adulthood.  This twenty-first year saw the coming of age of a
new type of individual that can now take their place as the
EDI Professional.  These individuals are the consultants,
neo-consultants, and semi-consultants who work for many types
of companies, and specialize in EDI as a profession.
Conferences like this one are the places where these people
come together to learn their trade, sharpen their skills, and
share ideas.  This conference showed that EDI is no longer a
sideline, but a primary job skill that needs to be treated as
such by business and industry.

This process of maturation is good for EDI as a whole.  For
most of its life, EDI has been something that has been
relegated to the systems departments of many companies with
the advice of the commercial management to identify the
needs of the company.  EDI now has to be taken as a primary
corporate function with roots extending into both the
commercial and systems side of any enterprise.

This change in the complexion of EDI was evident in the types
of sessions presented at the conference.  In the past, these
sessions were devoted to discussions of the specific
application of EDI in specific industries.  This year that
accent changed to a more general view of the use of EDI in
business as a whole.  The subjects presented included such
topics as "EDI Support Requirements for Smaller Trading
Partners," "EDI: An Academic Perspective," and "Legal
Considerations in Planning, Establishing and Managing EDI
Programs."

All of these topics address the real business needs and
theories that underlie the true purpose for the use of EDI.
EDI is not simply a means of automating specific business
tasks, but a way of integrating the flow of information,
material, and product through a chain that starts with raw
materials, progresses through transport and manufacturing,
and ends at the ultimate consumer of the product.  This true
nature of EDI was well evident at this year's conference.

The exhibition area also reflected the view of EDI as a
profession in itself.  More exhibits than ever before showed
the tools of the EDI trade, rather than the specific
applications of EDI that are available for doing business
with specific companies.  A myriad of generalized software
packages, communications networks, and consulting services
could be seen in the exhibition area, that allow any company
to become EDI-capable in short order.  It was obvious that
EDI is now available to all levels and sizes of business, and
at a reasonable cost.

The most significant event of the conference, however, was a
luncheon address by The Honorable Esteban E. Torres, United
States House of Rep-resentatives (D-California).  Congressman
Torres used this forum to announce the proposal of a
Congressional initiative to encourage the use of EDI in small
business.  In his position as Chair of the House Small
Business Subcommittee on Environment and Labor, he stated
that he would hold a series of field hearings during the
summer of 1990 on the impact and application of EDI in the
small business community of the United States.

The Congressman also stated that he would investigate
legislation that would provide a tax credit for the use of
EDI for both small business and big business in their
interaction with small business.  These two initiatives will
go a long way to encouraging the use of EDI to an even
greater extent, and is supported by an EDIA Task Force
directed toward the Small Business Community of the United
States.  The EDI community should welcome this announcement
with open arms, and support it to the best of their ability.

We have always spoken of EDI as a concept that will lead us
all to a bright future.  I suggest that future has now
dawned, and we will move into it during the 1990's.  Many are
fond of talking of how different this world will be at the
impending change of millennium in the year 2000.  The
shifting of the world political climate, the 1992 accords in
Europe, and the proliferation of EDI both nationally and
internationally will all contribute to this.  We, in EDI, can
look with pride to the significance of our own contribution
to this change.

EDI and Third Party Managers

Middlemen on the Fast Track

By Donald R. Greenwood

The historical role of the freight forwarder and broker must
be singled out if one is to understand the dynamics of
international trade.  This market segment has traditionally
been comprised of numerous small and medium sized companies,
the majority of which employs less than five people.

Until quite recently, most of these forwarders and brokers
used little automation in their day-to-day activities.  Their
primary means of communication consisted of the telephone,
facsimile, telex, couriers, and mail.  With the introduction
of the mini- and micro- computers, many of these companies
began to automate their back office functions (i.e.,
accounting and financial functions).  However, due to a lack
of off-the-shelf software and the high cost of people to
develop new software applications, these computer systems
were rarely used in the day-to-day operation of managing the
in and outbound international shipments.

The emergence of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and its
associated value-added computer applications, has sparked a
demand for more accurate shipment information and processing.
As a result, a new player-called the logistics management
company-is emerging.  These new full-service logistics
companies manage the physical and information flow of
shipments-from the purchase order all the way through to
final delivery.

Logistics management companies are making investments in
computer hardware, application software, and communications
to support their primary business.  This investment, in turn,
is forcing changes on the forwarders and brokers to automate
their own operations.  The need for expensive technology is
making survival difficult for small and medium-sized
forwarders and brokers not servicing a niche market.

The emergence of sophisticated third party managers has
led to several acquisitions and mergers within the industry.
The resulting influx of investment capital is allowing these
companies to expand both vertically and horizontally, with
the resulting larger companies increasing their services and
locations worldwide.  If the current trend continues, it
appears that fewer and larger forwarders, or "mega-
forwarders", will be managing the movement of international
shipments.  This trend is occurring within Europe, as well as
in North America.

If one were to forecast what changes are likely to occur in
the industry in the future, I would venture to say that
the Electronic Forwarder will emerge in the mid-1990's.  The
Electronic Forwarder will be a fully automated
forwarder/broker who has access to a worldwide communications
network for the electronic exchange of documents and
shipment-related information.

It will be possible to exchange information instantaneously
between clients, carriers (both domestic and international),
ports, government agencies, off-shore forwarders and brokers,
as well as ultimate consignees.  This information will be
available totally electronically and will provide immediate
accessibility from mainframe, mini-, and micro- computers
located around the world.

New products will include applications that address both the
operational and customer support needs of the industry.  They
will meet the needs of both back-office support systems as
well as the primary activities of the companies in the
international trade industry by integrating software with a
worldwide communications network that provides:

-shipment tracking and tracing (international and domestic)
-transportation scheduling
-electronic booking
-equipment tracking and management
-export/import documentation generation and exchange
broadcast messaging EDI with full standards support.
-electronic payments
-manifesting systems
-bay plan management

Although initially these applications wil be developed for
access via micro, mini, and mainframe computers, addressing
voice response systems via a handheld telephone handset will
be addressed.  These are just a few of the applications the
GE Information Services are developing to address the needs
of the industry.

transportation services at GE Information Services.  For more

EDI Standards

Edifact and CEN Join Forces
(Reprinted from EDIFACTS, the bulletin of the Western
European EDIFACT Board.)

In Helsinki, at a meeting held on the 27-28 September 1989,
the WE/EB arrived at an agreement with the European standards
body, CEN, which will give it associated body status.

Cen, the European Committee for Standardization, is made up
of the national standards bodies of the 18 EC and EFTA Member
States.  It works to implement harmonized standards in
Europe.

Once standards have been issued by CEN, they must be adopted
by the CEN members as national standards.  CEN has already
adopted some of the components of UN/EDIFACT, issuing the
data element directory as EN27 372 and the syntax rules as
EN29 735.  In the future, it will issue relevant UN messages
as European standards.

The signing of this new agreement will strengthen the
standards - making the role of the WE/EB, putting European
companies one step ahead in their preparations for the
integrated market place of 1992.

Technical Help To Exporters

European Certification Update

A look at what has happened to approval marks over the last
seventeen years.

In June 1972, Technical Help to Exporters' Quarterly Bulletin
featured an article on approval marks.  It looked at a range
of European marks then in existence, and the extensive use
which many European manufacturers made of them to sell into
different countries. Seventeen years on, an understanding of
the need for approval marks in the markets of different
countries remains just as important, despite moves towards
European harmonization.  All the marks shown in the 1972
article are still in existence; in fact, a few have been
added-particularly in Germany where the need for some third
party indication that a product is safe is most widespread.

It must be admitted that most serious exporters are much more
aware of the need for some sort of an approval mark than they
were seventeen years ago.  But many still think that the
'Common Market' and the approach of '1992' will obviate the
need for them to do much about it.

Directives from the European Commission on subjects such as
construction products, toys, personal protective equipment,
and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) are now illustrating
a European CE mark which is intended to indicate compliance
with the directives.  In some cases a manufacturer can put
this mark on his product and thus make his own claim of
compliance.  In other cases some test results from a
'recognized' laboratory must be available to support the
claim.  This raises many questions:-Will the need for
national marks go away?  Will national marks be obsolete
after 1992? Will national marks still be applied in addition
to the CE mark, or will national marks come to mean more than
they mean today, having 'quality', 'performance', or 'fitness
for purpose' connotations?  The German government's GS mark
which means 'tested for safety' is in fact used together with
the mark of the organization which did the testing, such as
VDE, TUV, BG, RAL, etc.

In the UK the British Standars Institute (BSI) Kitemark which
has existed since 1902 and the Safety Mark which was
developed in 1973 both mean something to purchasers in
Britain.  Both require a product not just to be safe but also
to be backed up, by BSI, as an indication of established
quality control.  The license has to satisfy BSI that his
manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing a
product made under quality controlled conditions.  Other
countries' marks indicate a similar process and are
recognized as such by purchasers in these countries.  They
are not, therefore, going to disappear overnight in 1992 just
because the Commission publishes a directive which
promulgates a CE mark.

Maybe one day we shall see fewer certification marks than
there are today but, as in the USA, it will be the market
place that will determine which, or even if, a certain mark
is needed.  Exporters can not ignore the need for
certification now and in the future.

Standards Europe

Report of US - EC Standards Discussions

Report provided by the Department of Commerce

On October 4 and 5, 1989, the U.S. Department of Commerce and
U.S. private sector experts met with experts on standards-
related matters from the European Community Commission and
the Committee for European Standardization (CEN) and the
Committee for European Electrotechnical Standardization
(CENELEC) to discuss U.S. concerns arising from the EC's 1992
initiatives to harmonize European standards, testing, and
certification.

Mandate and Objective

This was the first meeting between the United States and the
European Community that brought government and private sector
experts together for a detailed review of standards-related
matters.  In recent months, representatives of U.S. and
European private sector standards interests met on these
issues.  However, there was a growing and an overwhelming
expectation from the users of standards that governments
needed to formally engage on this matter to develop a broad
and balanced review.

It was expected that this meeting would clear up confusion
and misunderstanding and relieve concern stemming from the
EC's EC 1992 initiatives in standards, testing and
certification.  It was further expected that, where problems
were identified, the governments and their private sectors
would determine the appropriate next steps.

The meetings resulted from a May 31 agreement between U.S.
Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher and the EC Commission
Vice President Martin Bangemann.  At that time the U.S. and
the EC governments agreed that they:

-share the goal that the EC's single market should contribute
to sustaining an effective liberalization of trade and
investment.

-commit to the work of international standardization bodies
and the principle of transparency in standardization, testing
and certification.

-afford imports equal access to testing and certification
procedures as enjoyed by domestic products.

-encourage the recently-initiated exchanges between European
and United States standards bodies that advance these goals.

-meet and formally discuss any issues of mutual concern
regarding regulations, private sector standards activity, or
access to testing and certification for products.

Standards Development In The European Community

The European Community has devised a series of sectoral
strategies to terminate trade barriers within the EC market
due to standards-related practices.  These strategies follow
two general frameworks-one for regulated products and one for
non-regulated products.

The European Community intends to regulate food, drugs,
autos, and tractors by issuing mandatory harmonized European
technical specifications legislated entirely by the EC
Commission.  Any product meeting these legislated standards
is guaranteed the free circulation of the entire EC market.

The European Commmunity also intends to legislate harmonized
essential requirements covering safety, consumer protection,
and the environment for a wide range of products listed in
the Annex.  Products able to meet these essential
requirements are guaranteed free circulation throughout the
European Community.

The essential requirements and the criteria to meet these
essential requirements differ widely from product to product
depending on the level of risk and commercial factors.  Each
EC product directive specifies these differences.  Directives
are published in the EC Official Journal.

These product specific directives mandate the criteria to be
applied for declaring conformity to the mandatory
requirements, types of testing, and the nature of the
certification required in order to market the product in the
European Community.

The EC Commission has asked the European standards entities,
CEN and CENELEC to develop voluntary product standards that
in general are presumed to meet the mandatory requirements in
the EC directives.  In the case of construction products, the
EC Commission is developing "interpretative documents" and
code-type standards that concern the general safety
requirements of the building and engineering works themselves
which will ultimately be regulations.  At the same time,
CEN/CENELEC is developing voluntary standards for the
products that fall under this sector.

For telecommunications equipment and software, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute is developing
harmonized standards for terminal equipment and software.
These standards must be adopted by telecommunications
administrations in Europe.  Any product meeting these
standards is free to circulate in the European Community.

All other products not covered by directives are unregulated.
Technical specifications associated with the sale of these
products are those specified between a willing buyer and a
willing seller.  Such unregulated products are guaranteed
free circulation throughout the community.

Freedom of circulation in the EC Community for regulated and
unregulated products is supported by the legal principle of
mutual recognition.  That is, any product that is able to be
sold in one EC member state market is guaranteed access to
all other EC markets.

For the regulated products listed in the annex, the
CEN/CENELEC needs to develop 900 product standards by
January 1, 1993.  In the event that harmonized CEN/CENELEC
standards are not completed by that date, the European
Community will adopt an interim standard until the
CEN/CENELEC work can be completed.  This interim standard
will probably be selected from the existing European
standards which most closely approximates the requirements in
the EC legislation.  The EC could select a non-EC standard.
The EC probably will not allow the mutual recognition of
existing national standards as the transition.

Although the EC Commission has no intention of changing
product standards legislation already adopted, in certain
instances current legislation will be amended to simplify
requirements within product groups and improve consistency of
approach for companies.  For example, the machinery directive
will be amended to include small forklift trucks and lifting
and loading equipment which were covered by previous
legislation.  In like manner, the EC is reevaluating the
consistency of approach for electrical products which could
result in amendments to recent directives and the termination
of older directives.

Because the EC product directives were developed over a
period of 5 years or more, there are a variety of
inconsistent requirements for products regarding testing,
certification and marking.  The EC Commission can be expected
to develop various amendments as the system evolves.

For telecommunications equipment and software, the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute is developing
harmonized standards for terminal equipment and software.
These standards must be adopted by telecommunications
administrations in Europe.  Any product meeting these
standards is free to circulate in the European Community.

All other products not covered by directives are unregulated.
Technical specifications associated with the sale of these
products are those specified between a willing buyer and a
willing seller.  Such unregulated products are guaranteed
free circulation throughout the community.

Freedom of circulation in the EC Community for regulated and
unregulated products is supported by the legal principle of
mutual recognition.  That is, any product that is able to be
sold in one EC member state market is guaranteed access to
all other EC markets.

For the regulated products listed in the annex, the
CEN/CENELEC needs to develop 900 product standards by
January 1, 1993.

In the event that harmonized CEN/CENELEC standards are not
completed by that date, the European Community will adopt an
interim standard until the CEN/CENELEC work can be completed.
This interim standard will probably be selected from the
existing European standards which most closely approximates
the requirements in the EC legislation.  The EC could select
a non-EC standard.  The EC probably will not allow the mutual
recognition of existing national standards as the
transition.

Although the EC Commission has no intention of changing
product standards legislation already adopted, in certain
instances current legislation will be amended to simplify
requirements within product groups and improve consistency of
approach for companies.  For example, the machinery directive
will be amended to include small forklift trucks and lifting
and loading equipment which were covered by previous
legislation.  In like manner, the EC is reevaluating the
consistency of approach for electrical products which could
result in amendments to recent directives and the termination
of older directives.

Because the EC product directives were developed over a
period of 5 years or more, there are a variety of
inconsistent requirements for products regarding testing,
certification and marking.  The EC Commission can be expected
to develop various amendments as the system evolves.

The European Community requires all member states to regulate
further national standards development so that new standards
activity does not interfere in the EC internal market.
Generally, member states must notify the EC of new national
standards development proposals and the EC Commission must
decide if it wants to intercede with a proposal for the
development of an EC-wide standard.  Also, under the Single
European Act, EC member states may keep a previously existing
essential requirement more stringent than the EC proposal if
the EC Commission agrees.  These are the only exceptions to
the harmonization process.

International Standardization and EC 1992

In order to complete its work by January 1, 1993, CEN/CENELEC
has stated that it wants to use international standards (ISO
and IEC standards) where these standards are appropriate to
meet the EC's essential requirements and the standards can be
developed in a timely manner.

The United States stated that sole reliance on ISO/IEC
requires effort to make the ISO/IEC activities and procedures
relevant to manufacturers and professionals in the respective
markets.

The United States stated that it was interested in using the
ISO/IEC forum as one of the ways to participate in the EC
standards development. In some products, the EC had adopted
IEC and ISO standards.  However, in many product areas there
was no international work, international work had been
blocked, or international work was not being used.

The United States government and the EC Commission agreed to
review the ability of their respective private standards
bodies to live up to their commitment to use international
standards.

Transparency of EC Commission and CEN/CENELEC

The EC Commission will not share early drafts of EC
directives.  The only official access to information on
essential requirements is in the EC Official Journal.

The EC Commission is willing to consult with U.S. interests
at any point over its regulations.  CEN/CENELEC stated that
it has recently instituted several changes to make its
process more transparent to non-members. CEN/CENELEC
publishes draft standards and monthly activity reports that
summarize working group activities.  These publications are
available through ANSI New York City.

CEN/CENELEC has agreed to accept comments from U.S. interests
through ANSI in New York City.  Comments may be made at any
stage of standardization.

ANSI intends to submit all U.S. comments on CEN/CENELEC
standards activities to review by the Technical Advisory
Groups (TAGs) before being submitted to CEN/CENELEC.  In
the absence of TAGs, ANSI intends to submit comments directly
to CEN/CENELEC.

CEN/CENELEC have encouraged their working groups to accept
oral presentations from non-EC interests.

ANSI reported that its proposal to ISO to have members of the
ISO technical committees participate in the standards
development work of the CEN/CENELEC had been refused. ANSI
reported that CEN agreed to joint review of work plans.

The US government and the EC Commission agreed to review the
effectiveness of these methods of transparency worked out
between CEN/CENELEC and ANSI.

Testing and Certification

For regulated products, on the date of implementation of EC
product directives, the European Community intends to allow
only the sale of such products that bear a CE mark of
conformity to EC essential requirements.  Regulated products
without this mark cannot be sold in the EC.

The ECE mark will signify that the regulated products have
complied with the EC essential requirements and will be
allowed free circulation in the EC.

The CE mark signifies that the product conforms with the
essential requirements in the EC directives in a manner
specified in the applicable EC product directive.

While many of these product directives rely on CEN/CENELEC
product standards, other standards may be recognized and in
some product directives adherence to standards are not
expected.

No mark is required for non-regulated products except those
agreed by a willing buyer and seller.

Additional marks will continue to be affixed to products as
"quality" marks signifying performance or safety levels more
stringent than that specified by the CE mark.  Absence of
those national "quality" marks does not affect the legal
right to market a product.

For the most part, the date of implementation of these EC
product directives is in 1992 but no later than January 1,
1993.  (Toys, pressure vessels and electromagnetic
compatibility are implemented in 1990 and 1991).

EC product directives covering products listed in the annex
specify the means of proving conformance.  These mandatory
procedures offer some flexibility to manufacturers to choose
among options to show compliance but the specific directive
dictates the type of conformance procedure and these
requirements must be met.

Proof of conformance requires that the CE mark be affixed to
the product.  Depending on the EC product directive, the CE
mark can be affixed by the manufacturer or an approved body.

Interpretation of essential requirements related to EC
product directives summarized on the previous pages and the
interpretation of compliance with European Norms or standards
generated by CEN/CENELEC rely upon approved bodies to perform
tests, certify compliance, audit quality control systems and
so on.

At this time, member state governments are the only entities
that can approve these testing and certifying bodies to
perform the services required in the EC directives.

The EC Commission states that approved bodies in the EC must
carry out the third party intervention in a non-
discriminatory manner.

At this time, member states will only approve entities to
perform services required by the EC directives that are
located within their national boundaries.  Member states also
are required to accept the approvals of all other member
states in the products covered by the directives.

Selected EC product directives rely on accreditation of
quality assurance techniques in manufacturing plants as the
means to show compliance with an essential requirement.
CEN/CENELEC has adopted EN29000 series standards on quality
assurance to advance harmonization.  EN29000 is the European
version of ISO 9000.

In like manner, EC testing labs, inspection and certifying
bodies follow EN45000 standards on establishing competence of
bodies.  CEN/CENELEC is developing sectoral elaborations for
these rules as well as EN29000.

It is EC Commission's recommendation that in the future
foreign bodies be approved to perform regulated activities
called for in the EC product directives outside the EC.  In
order to have any force in the marketplace, the EC Council
must adopt the EC Commission recommendation.  Council
adoption may come as soon as January 1990.

The EC Commission has recommended that foreign testing and
certifying bodies be required to satisfy the same criteria
for becoming an EC approving authority as is inherently
applied to the EC testing and certifying authorities.
Therefore, foreigners must be prepared to:

-guarantee adherence to the EC essential requirements

-adopt EN29000 and EN45000 series of standards as the basic
technical instruments for performing regulated activities.
(Any sectoral adaptations to these basic series developed by
the EC must also be complied with.)

-competence must be maintained on a continuous basis.

-guarantees must be developed for equivalent and equal access
to the market provide for mutual benefits under the systems.

In the case of foreign approvals the EC will look for a
national system that can guarantee that approval bodies meet
EC requirements.  This does not have to be the U.S.
government nor does it have to be a single system for all
products or approvals.

The EC Commission expects that the approved bodies notified
under the directives will carry out the negotiations with
third country entities to establish mutual recognition
agreements.  EC Council will approve these agreements before
they can be implemented to assure that the objectives of the
EC have been met.

All existing bilateral agreements between EC member state
testing and certifying bodies and third country bodies will
have to be transposed (renegotiated) as EC-wide bilateral
agreements when the EC product directives are implemented
under the conditions stated above including "mutual
benefits."

In addition to the CE mark, many EC directives require
additional product labels that give an EC contact point for
the manufacturer.  In virtually all directives, the European
standard developed by CEN/CENELEC carries additional weight
that aids the manufacturer to establish conformity to the
essential requirements in the EC product directive.

Office of European Community Affairs, International Trade
Administration, Washington D.C. 20230.

1992 Center in the U.S.

George Mason University Center

Focus on 1992

George Mason University's Center for European Community (EC)
Studies, which opened last month in Norfolk, Virginia, is no
ivory tower enterprise.  The Center was established with the
explicit purpose of providing the business community with
information and assistance in understanding developments in
European efforts to establish a single market by 1992.

GMU's designation as a European Documentation Center, by the
European Commission in Brussels, will help it to accomplish
this goal.  The Center will receive all EC official
publications and will have unlimited access to EC databases
in Brussels and Luxembourg.  With these resources, it will be
a unique information base for Northern Virginia and the
greater Washington area; both of which generate a strong
demand for international economic information.

The colleges of George Mason University will also benefit
from the center's resources, as well as its promotion of
research, conferences, and seminars on EC issues.  The
undertaking of collaberative research projects between
European and American academics will also benefit the rest of
the University.

Another GMU program of particular interest to exporters is
the Entrepreneurship Institute.  Established in 1986, the
institute has focused its efforts on encouraging
entrepreneurial approaches to business.  On the international
level, the institute aims to promote export expansion,
particularly amongst small, high-technology companies.  The
European center will give impetus to their efforts by
providing access to information about the latest developments
in the European market.

The EC Center will also house the headquarters of the
European Community Studies Association (ECSA), an association
of European scholars and researchers in the United States.
The organization held its first conference in May 1989 with
its second planned for May 1991.

European Community Studies, George Mason University, Suite
450, Quincy Street Station, 4001 North Fairfax Drive.

Predex Forecast

Update of a Ten-Year Forecast

Provided by Predex Corp.

The Rand

Ten years ago a client asked us to forecast the rand ten
years out.  Last March the Financial Mail reported the
results (see below), and wondered how the model, updated with
data of the past decade, would forecast the next ten years.
Under the conditions described below, this simple model sees
the rand recovering in 1990-91.

How bad can a worst-case scenario be?  Worse even than a
forecaster's wildest expectations.  A 10-year projection on
the rand, made in 1980 by U.S. currency analyst Charles
Ramond, plotted a series of alternative outcomes based on 12
different scenarios-and failed to come up with any estimate
as bad as reality.

Though Ramond, president of Predex Corporation, "oldest
independent forecaster of currencies," correctly interpreted
the trend, he failed to foresee the strength of the forces
working against the rand.  His worst-case prediction was
pitched at a rand of around US75 cents in 1988 - instead of
the 43 cents it actually averaged last year.

Why was reality so much worse than expected?

Within the confines of the model, two assumptions turned out
to be grossly understated.  The predictions thrown out by
what Ramond describes as a naive model were based on two
factors: the real price of gold (the price adjusted for US
inflation), and US inflation in relation to the SA inflation
rate.

When the forecast was written in 1980, says Ramond, the rand
had been worth between $1,15-$1,40 for most of 14 years.
"Inflation was raging worldwide, US long rates were nearing
20% and a Federal Reserve (Fed) chairman named Volcker was
about to throttle that inflation with the deepest US
recession since World War 2."

As a result of Volcker's success, Ramond was wrong in two of
three assumptions. Though he correctly predicted SA's
inflation rate was likely to be higher than that of the US if
it was not the same, he did not foresee:

-The real gold price falling, as it has uninterruptedly up
until the present; or

-The wide divergence between inflation rates in the US and
SA.

Ramond estimated the lowest year-on-year change in US CPI
would be 5%. "It actually reached 2% before rising again.
Similarly for SA, the highest CPI we assumed in any year was
14%-which it has exceeded for the past four years."

Factors not taken into account by the model, which exerted a
powerful influence on the rand in recent years, were capital
flight and credit sanctions.  The effect of these is
illustrated in the graph which carries a forecast based on
actual gold prices and relative inflation rates of the US and
SA, contrasted with what happened in the years to 1988. The
discrepancy is due to factors outside the model.

Crucial to the future course of the rand is the continuing
success of US monetary policy.

On this score Ramond has some reservations.  He says, in
a recent presentation on the US economy, present Fed chairman
Alan Greenspan referred to an (unidentified) economic
indicator which has been flashing warnings of inflation for
several years.  And, as a result, he has been attempting to
choke back growth in M2 since last March.

Ramond believes Greenspan's attempts to hold down
inflationary forces may be undermined by monetisation of
debts of the devasted savings and loan industry.

What is bad news for the US may then bring a measure of good
to SA.

Political Risk Letter

Country Updates

Political and Economic Forecasts from PRS, a division of IBC
USA.

Changes in Eastern Europe

This article is a summary of a special report in the
December 1989 issue of Country Forecasts, which contains
detailed analysis and comparative rankings of the countries
of Eastern Europe.

Irreversible Momentum for Economic Liberalization:

The introduction of market mechanism in the Soviet Union and
most of the other Eastern European states is irreversible.
At the same time, the movement toward open economies will be
slow and tortuous.  Many pockets of political and
bureaucratic opposition remain to disrupt reform, so that the
rules of the game will be altered frequently.  The key
elements will be ability of Gorbachev to remain in power in
the Soviet Union and the progress made in East Germany toward
economic coordination with West Germany.

Political reform, on the other hand, will proceed at a much
slower pace, with movement toward liberalization intermixed
with repression.  Political liberalization may even be
stymied, particularly if nationality conflict increases
substantially in the Soviet Union.  However, even a return to
widespread political repression, would only slow, not
reverse, economic liberalization.

Business Prospects Are Improved, But Limited:

Within the next 3 to 5 years the risks of unexpected and
unusual costs outweigh the potential for profits except for
the sale of products and services that improve the base for
long-range economic development.

Key Risk Factors:

-A chronic shortage of foreign currency.

-Poor training, experience, and attitude among both labor and
management.

-An entrenched bureaucracy resistant to change.

These problems are similar to those that plague most Third
World countries.  The difference with Eastern Europe is that
its economies, while under-developed, contain much more
potential than those of Africa and Latin America.  The
workforce is relatively educated and the underclass is
relatively small.  In addition, the economic development of
Eastern Europe is a much higher priority to the countries of
Western Europe than economic development in Latin America or
sub-Sahara Africa is to the industrialized countries.

Better business prospects are by no means certain.  In any
case, the opportunities will not be uniform throughout
Eastern Europe. Continued improvement depends on several
economic and political conditions, including avoidance of
nationallity conflicts and territorial disputes; continued
cooperation between the United States and the USSR; the
coming to power of competent leadership in Eastern Europe;
and adequate aid and investment from OECD countries.

If these conditions were to develop, the economies of most
Eastern European countries could be equal in strength and
business potential to some of the newly industrialized
countries by the year 2000.

Pre-1945 Economic Performance Will Be A Guide To The
Future:

In estimating the varying strengths and weaknesses of the
economies of Eastern Europe, the health of the economies
prior to World War II is a better guideline than the current
political attitudes toward reform.  It is easier to change
political leaders, official government policies, and even
ideology than the attitudes of potential business managers,
the discipline and skill of the labor force, and economic
infrastructure.  In addition to these crucial long-term
economic factors, it is also necessary to look at each
country's debt, hard currency positions, and experience with
private market mechanism during the last forty years.  Based
on these political, economic, and financial considerations
Eastern European countries are ranked below-from the best to
worst-with respect to climate for international business over
the next ten years:

(1) East Germany
(2) Czechoslovakia
(3) Hungary
(4) Poland
(5) Romania
(6) USSR
(7) Bulgaria
(8) Yugoslavia

The events in Eastern Europe will have a variety of effects
on other parts of the world.  Most important is in Western
Europe, especially West Germany. German firms already have a
head start on trade and investment in Eastern Europe, and
will be able to move quickly to take advantage of the new
opportunities in the region.  The movement toward EC 1992
will not be significantly slowed by recent events, as long as
the question of German reunification does not become a
stumbling block.  Firms from North America and Japan will
find it much more difficult than European firms to capitalize
on developments on the continent.

Bulgaria-Slow Economic Reform

After resisting pressure for reform from both the Soviet
Union and within the country, Bulgaria's long-term leader,
Tidor Zhivkov, stepped down in November.  The government had
permitted more dissent in recent months despite occasional
crackdowns, and had allowed some private activity in the
service sector at the urging of the Soviet Union.  However,
events in East Germany in November appear to have convinced
the leadership that Zhivkov had to go and that economic
reform had to be pursued more vigorously.

Poor economic conditions and resistance from within the
bureaucracy and party will limit the speed of economic
reform.  The new leadership itself is drawn from those who
were influential in the Zhivkov regime.  The new Communist
party leader is Petar Mladenov who was the Foreign Minister
udner the previous regime for 18 years.  The most crucial
factor, however, will be the degree of economic progress in
the more reformist Eastern Europe.  Bulgaria will continue to
follow rather than lead in dismantling the state control of
its economy.

Brazil-Collor Slight Favorite

The first state of the voting has left a clear choice for the
Brazilian electorate which votes on December 17th.  The
front-runner in the first round was the forty year old former
state governor, Fernando Collor de Mello, who will face the
labor leader Luis Inacio da Silva, popularly referred to as
Lula. Collor is advocating privatization and austerity and
openness to international business while Lula is calling for
strong central government control, land reform, and less
openness to international business.

With a television debate and stronger party base for Lula,
Collor will have a tough time winning the election despite
his strong showing in the first election.  However, support
from the center and right along with his youth should enable
him to win a close race. Because the two houses of Congress
are likely to be hopelessly divided among several parties,
whoever wins the presidency is likely to pursue policies less
extreme than the positions they currently advocate.
Nevertheless, a victory by Collor is much preferred by the
domestic and international business community.

China-Business Conditions Decline

Despite an attempt to attract new foreign investment with
promises of more open-door policies, the government will be
unable to reverse declines touched off by the student
uprising in June 1989.  Foreign exchange reserves are
drastically down, from $19 billion in April to $14 billion in
June.  Foreign debt service payments to reach peak in the
1990-1992 period, although the debt service ratio is still
low compared with other Third World countries.  China will be
paying higher interest rates because of a reduced credit
rating by international financial institutions.

Japanese businesses have maintained their investments in
China, but Japanese banks are not likely to put in more
money.  Several joint-venture automobile factories have been
forced to close because of reduced domestic demand and
bureaucratic inaction.  More restrictions on imports can be
expected to protect foreign reserves.

Tough austerity measures have slowed growth and halted what
was becoming a runaway inflation.  However, popular
dissatisfaction with the measures will require tight
political control, which will further reduce worker morale.
The replacement of troops with police at key points in
Beijing will likely be followed by other symbolic acts on the
political front, such as the removal of martial law, in order
to reduce human rights pressure.  Business interests have
lost influence among the leadership, and the ascendance of
the hardliners is likely to last for some time.

Shipping Regulations

Report on the 1984 Shipping Act

The following has been abstracted from an executive summary
of the Section 18 Report on The Shipping Act of 1984,
published by the Federal Maritime Commission, September 1989.

Overview

Under the 1984 Act's new agreement review process and
standard, the Commission experienced (a) an increase in the
average number of agreements and modifications filed each
year; (b) a reduction in average processing time per
agreement; and (c) a decline in the cost of proceedings
before the Commission.  These changes freed more Commission
resources for expanded enforcement actions which brought
about significant increases in penalty collections.

These procedural improvements also enabled the Commission to
devote more time to address foreign government restraints on
shipping.  The Commission instituted more proceedings under
section 19 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, since enactment
of the 1984 Act than at any other comparable period of time.
These Commission actions have had a positive influence on
trading conditions in the US foreign commerce.

The 1984 Act's reforms did not bring about the negative
consequences that some observers predicted.  The creation of
"superconferences" and the increase in rationalization
agreements did not result in sharp rate increases,
curtailment of shipping services, or loss of independent
carrier competition.  The 1984 Act did not have a significant
impact on rate levels, service frequency, and the strength of
independent competition.  The US trades remained open and
competitive.

The popularity of the IA and the service contract provisions
of the 1984 Act led to a disagreement about whether common
carriage obligations should be relaxed.  In particular, major
shippers have called for a greater role for contract
carriage.  These shippers would like Congress to establish a
clear distinction between common carriage under tariff rates
and carriage under service contracts.  They would (a) require
that the terms of service contracts be kept confidential; and
(b) prohibit conferences from restricting the right to their
members to enter into service contracts.

Carriers, on the other hand, assert that these steps would
ultimately undermine the tariff system, the conference
system, and the principle of common carriage in ocean
shipping.  Instead, they advocate continued filing and
publication of the "essential terms" of service contracts and
the availability of those terms to similarly situated
shippers.

The Impact of the 1984 Act on the International Shipping
Industry

As required by the 1984 Act, the Commission collected and
analyzed information on the Act's impact on rates, service,
independent carriers, and regulatory proceedings.  In
addition, the Commission conducted a series of annual surveys
to solicit the views of the maritime industry on the
consequences of the 1984 Act.  These survey results were
supplemented by policy papers presented by industry
representatives serving on the Section 18 Study Advisory
Committee.

The major conclusions to be drawn from this information are
as follows.

Data and Analysis on the Impact of the 1984 Act

(1) The Commission experienced an increase in the average
number of carrier agreements and modifications filed each
year, and a reduction in the average processing time per
agreement.

(2) Changes in the agreement review process and standard of
review made easier the creation of superconferences and the
use of conference intermodal authority.

(3) The 45-day agreement effectiveness provision in the 1984
Act decreased the average processing time for agreements to
become effective to less than one-third of that required for
approval prior to the 1984 Act.  The total cost of major
proceedings declined as well.

(4) Following implementation of the 1984 Act, there was a
decline in the number of major proceedings before the
Commission coupled with a modest increase in the average
length of those proceedings.  The Commission was able,
therefore, to concentrate its resources on more complex
proceedings and other issues, including enforcement cases and
strategies.

(5) Independent action rates and service contracts expanded
the commercial options available to the shipping public.  In
some trades, port-to-port tariff rates became the exception
rather than the rule.

(6) The main factors that explain freight rate structures
(value, tonnage, distance, direction, stowage, refrigeration)
did not change appreciably as a result of the 1984 Act.
Where change was noted - in the significance of the direction
variable (i.e., outbound US versus inbound US)- the most
likely cause appeared to be trade flow imbalances, rather
than provisions of the 1984 Act.

(7) Quarterly rate data on the major moving commodities in 18
US trades between 1976 and 1988 indicate that fluctuations in
the supply of and demand for liner shipping services - not IA
and service contract provisions -were the basic cause of the
rate changes that occurred after implementation of the 1984
Act.

(8) A comparative study of rate stability in 18 US trades
before and after implementation of the 1984 Act indicates
that only six US/Pacific trades experienced a decrease in
rate stability.  However, that decrease began in 1982,
suggesting that changes in the international economy were the
primary cause.

(9) A comparison of shipping capacity growth rates before and
after implementation of the 1984 Act showed that, of the six
US trades studied (North Europe, the North Pacific, the South
Pacific, Italy, Australia and Brazil), three trades exhibited
no dramatic changes in growth; two trades showed significant
increases in capacity growth; and one trade, the Australia
trade, showed a decrease in capacity growth.  These results
suggest that the prevailing economic conditions in specific
trades, rather than particular provisions of the 1984 Act,
were the important influences on the level of capacity
provided to shippers.

(10) A comparison of the largest US trade, the Pacific trade,
with the largest non-US trade, North Europe/Far East,
involving nine basic service parameters, revealed broadly
similar patterns of change during 1984 to 1988 period.  These
results further support the view that factors other than the
1984 Act were mainly responsible for changes in service
levels.

(11) Data from the six trades studied indicate that no
contraction in the average number of direct ship calls
occurred between 1984-1988.  In fact, the average number of
calls made annually in the US port regions studied increased
slightly.

(12) As inland transport costs declined relative to all-water
transport costs, service concentration at the US range
closest to the foreign destination increased.

(13) The relative strength of independent carriers, as
reflected in the proportion of total shipping capacity
provided, has changed little since the implementation of the
1984 Act.  In some individual trades, such as the North
Europe trade, independents made significant market share
inroads.

(14) Independent carriers made significant gains in terms of
tonnage carried in the largest US trade, i.e., the Pacific
trade.

(15) Comparisons of value-to-tonnage ratios between
conference and independent carriers show that in most US
trades, conference cargo mixes yield a higher ratio.  But
figures also show that independent carriers reduced the
difference between their ratio and those of the conferences
in most US trades.  Independents appear to be increasing the
proportion of high-valued cargo in their cargo mix.

(16) The Brazil trade, with its bilateral maritime agreement,
revenue pooling agreements, and cargo reservation laws, is
characterized by high conference market share with no
independent action on rates.

Industry Views on the 1984 Shipping Act

The views offered by various industry segments affected by
the 1984 Act varied widely.  They varied both across
industries and within each industry.  A presentation of each
industry group's views is contained in Chapter 7.  To the
extent that consensus exists on some key points, the
following broad conclusions can be drawn:

(1) There is industry support for retaining an "open"
conference system in the US trades.  Alternative approaches,
such as prohibiting conferences or allowing "closed"
conferences, had little support.

(2) A majority of the international ocean shipping industry
supported the proposition that tariffs continue to be filed
with, and enforced by, the FMC.

(3) The revised agreement review process in the 1984 Act has
proven beneficial.

(4) The more controversial 1984 Act provisions are (a) the
mandatory independent action provision, and (b) the provision
permitting service contracts.  Generally, shippers tended to
endorse shorter notice periods for IA and the extension of IA
to service contracts, while carriers tended to prefer the
opposite.

Volume and Mass Tariff System

(1) In response to Commission surveys, neither users nor
providers of tariffs favored a system of tariffs based solely
on volume and mass (i.e., weight or measure) or a
freight-all-kinds system.

(2) An analysis of the economic implications of adopting a
system of tariffs based on volume and mass suggests that such
a system could cause distortions in the existing
transportation system.

(3) Volume and mass tariffs might lead to a simpler system,
and therefore require less regulatory oversight.  Such a
system could also:

(a) reduce the movement of low-valued cargo in the US trades;

(b) increase the impact of IA on conferences;

(c) create distortions in the choice of ports if Canada, for
example, does not impose a similar system; and

(d) complicate intermodal ratemaking.

(4) Based on both data and theory, it is difficult to make a
case for adopting a system of tariffs based on volume and
mass of shipment.

(5) There was some support, especially among shippers, for a
lump-sum per container system.  This suggests support a more
simplified tariff structure.

(6) There is little data to support the contention that the
current rate structure results from conferences' exercise of
monopoly power.

Antitrust Immunity for Ports and Marine Terminal Operators

(1) The regulation of marine terminals was a reaction to the
pricing policies of railroad-owned marine terminals and their
effects on competition among shippers lines.  The current
system of terminal control and coordination by state-
sponsored public port authorities does not present similar
threats to competition.

(2) The need for antitrust immunity to lessen excessive
competition depends on one's theoretical point of view.  The
neoclassical economic interpretation concludes that there is
no strong case for antitrust immunity.  On the other hand,
the Austrian economic view states that a case can be made for
granting antitrust immunity.

(3) Public or quasi-public agencies are not motivated solely
by economic considerations, and antitrust principles based on
the traditional ideas of competition may not be fully
applicable.  Interport conferences that include members from
two or more states generally are not successful in reducing
interport competition.

(4) There is no clear public benefit in allowing private
marine terminal operators to collectively fix rates and
charges within a port.  Granting antitrust protection for
such purposes may not be necessary or economically
justifiable.

(5) The need to provide antitrust immunity for port
authorities and private terminal operators to allow "parity"
with carrier conferences is questionable.  Carriers'
bargaining strength over terminal leases or services is
generally due to port-related geographical and logistical
factors and the availability of alternative ports-of-call,
not to the carriers' 1984 Act antitrust immunity.

(6) Public port authorities may enjoy protection from US
antitrust laws even without 1984 Act antitrust immunity.
However, not all ports may enjoy the same level of immunity.
This could result in a nonuniform application of antitrust
immunity.

(7) Whether to retain the current 1984 Act antitrust immunity
provisions dealing with marine terminals, or to limit them
only to public port authorities, or to remove them
altogether, requires a value judgment that balances all
regulatory concerns.  These include economic analysis,
antitrust policy, state and federal regulatory
responsibilities, and established industry practices.

FMC Tariff Filing and Enforcement

(1) The historical record reflects a continuing reliance on
tariff filing and enforcement.

(2) Based on annual survey responses, a majority of the
shipping industry favor the continuation of the existing
tariff filing and enforcement system.

(3) Surveys indicate that carriers believe they should
continue to have the right to file excepted commodity rates,
but oppose IA on these rates.  Shippers are divided on the
filing issue but favor mandatory IA on excepted commodity
rates.

(4) Surveys of the tariff filing and enforcement practices of
foreign governments reveal a trend towards increased tariff
regulation.

(5) The commission would find it difficult to meet its
legislatively mandated responsibilities in the absence of
tariff requirements.

(6) Of the policy options considered, only the existing
system ensures a nondiscriminatory ocean transportation
system.

(7) The existing tariff filing and enforcement mechanism, in
an open conference environment, can promote market
efficiency, ensure fair treatment of shippers by carriers,
and preserve just competition between carriers.

Summaries of Supplementary Reports

Service Contracts

(1) Service contracts have had a significant impact upon the
maritime community.  During the period of study, carriers and
conferences filed 17,103 service contracts and substantial
amounts of cargo moved under those contracts.

(2) Sixty-nine percent of service contract filings were by
independents (or individual conference carriers), and 31
percent were by conferences.

(3) Evergreen Line filed more service contracts (2,333) than
any other carrier or conference.  The Asia North America
Eastbound Rate Agreement ("ANERA") had the second highest
total (1,317), and the North Europe-U.S. Atlantic Conference
was third (1,253).

(4) There was a wide variation in rates between service
contracts and tariffs for similar commodities carried by
conferences.

(5) Industry opinions are mixed on both effects of service
contracts and the extent to which the service contract
provisions of the 1984 Act should be amended.

(a) Since 1986, carriers have increasingly indicated that
service contracts have had a positive impact on their firms.

(b) Shippers, especially those who have successfully
negotiated them, view service contracts favorably.

(c) Majority support existed in the maritime community for
continuing to require that the essential terms of service
contracts be made publicly available.

However, a significant number of shippers prefer confidential
contracts.

(d) Carriers oppose, while shippers support requiring
independent action on service contracts.

Independent Action

(1) IA allows conference members to offer lower rates and
more responsive service to shippers.  IA enhances the
competitiveness and flexibility of conferences because the
members are able to compete both among themselves and with
independents.  If intraconference competition becomes too
intense, the ability of the conference to stabilize rates can
be threatened.  Although mandatory independent action may
have expedited changes in tariff rates, market conditions
determined their ultimate levels.

(2) The large number of IAs taken by two conferences in the
Pacific trades, the Transpacific Westbound Rate Agreement
("TWRA") AND ANERA, may reflect the level of competition from
independents in those trades.  The recent decrease in the use
of IAs by TWRA carriers may be explained by growing US
exports that have served to reduce excess shipping capacity.
Slowing imports may be the reason for the growing use of IA
by ANERA carriers.

(3) Mandatory independent action in conference agreements was
not subject to as much debate as was the length of the
maximum IA notice period.  The current ten-day maximum period
was opposed by carriers and supported by shippers.  While the
ten-day notice period may have facilitated carrier rate
reductions, it did not cause them.  The cause was more likely
overtonnaging.

(4) Service contract rates were affected by IA on tariff
rates because tariff rates were often the basis for
negotiating service contract rates.

(5) It is difficult to formulate specific conclusions
concerning IA on service contracts (i.e., a member's right to
enter into individual service contracts), because of the
minimal amount of such activity under the 1984 Act.  The
impact of service contract IA on the conference's ability to
establish uniform rates in an overtonnaged market could last
longer than for IA on tariffs, because a service contract
effectively diverts at least a portion of a shipper's cargo
from other carriers for the duration of the contract (rather
than for a single voyage).

Technical Adjustments, Clarifications, and Anomalies

The Commission has identified certain provisions of the 1984
Act which are unclear or might create unintended effects.
these provisions are discussed in the Section 18 Report's
final chapter.
