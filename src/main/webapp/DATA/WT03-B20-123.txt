<h1>Renewable Energy: Solar Thermal</h1><p>
<p>
Solar thermal technology converts sunlight into usable forms of heat.  
This
heat can be used directly, for example, in passive solar building design 
and
roof-mounted water heating systems used for residential, commercial, and
industrial applications.  Other solar thermal systems use the captured 
heat to
drive electric generators, producing electricity on a utility scale; 
these are
known as solar thermal electric systems.<p>
<p>
<h2>Resource</h2>
Solar thermal technology is diverse.  Small systems can be installed on 
the
roofs of homes to heat water for domestic use.  Moderate-size systems can

supply hot water, steam, and hot air to schools, hospitals, businesses, 
and
industries.  Large solar thermal electric installations can generate
electricity in quantities comparable to those generated in 
intermediate-size
utility generating plants (that is, 100 to 200 megawatts [MW] of
electricity).  The technology can also be used to destroy environmental
contaminants in air, water, and soil.<p>

Among the first mechanical uses of solar thermal energy was a 20 square
meter, parabolic concentrating reflector, steam-driven printing press at 
the
World's Fair in Paris in 1878.<p>

Within 15 years, renewable energy, including solar thermal technologies, 
could
be generating enough electricity to power 40 million homes and to offset 
70
days of oil imports.  This technical potential equates to 42% of the 
number of
homes in the U.S. in 1994.<p>

Solar collectors covering less than half of Nevada could supply all of 
the
United States' energy needs.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use</h2>
Passive solar buildings are being built today that save as much as 50% on

heating bills for only 1% more in construction costs.<p>

More than 350 MW of solar thermal electric systems have been installed in 
the
United States, enough to serve the residential needs of the city of 
Seattle;
this equals 90% of the world's installed solar capacity.<p>

Solar thermal electric systems operating in the United States today meet 
the
needs of 350,000 people (equal to the population of the city of Miami) 
and
displace the equivalent of 2.3 million barrels of oil annually.<p>

The U.S. has about 400 MW of privately financed solar 
steam-to-electricity
facilities that are interconnected to utility-grade power plants.<p>

More than one-half million solar hot water systems have been installed in 
the
United States, mostly on single-family homes.  The majority of these 
systems
are used to heat swimming pools.<p>

Typically, a homeowner relying on electricity to heat water could save up 
to
$500 in the first year of operation by installing a solar water heating 
system.
The savings over time increases due to increasing electricity rates.  The

average solar heating system pays for itself in 4 to 7 years.<p>

Roof-mounted solar hot water systems are often designed to look like 
skylights,
making them more pleasing in appearance to homeowners and their 
neighbors.<p>
<p>
<h2>Projected Use</h2>
Solar thermal electric capacity is predicted to increase 130% worldwide 
by the
year 2000.<p>

The cost of building, operating, and maintaining solar thermal electric 
systems
has decreased dramatically--in some cases by a factor of ten--during the 
last
decade.  Some designs will be economically competitive with conventional
electricity-generating technologies by the year 2000.<p>

By the middle of the next decade, some solar thermal electric 
technologies
could be producing electricity at $0.06 to $0.07 per kilowatt hour (kWh).

Average electricity prices were $0.08/kWh for residential users and $0.05 
for
industrial users in 1993.<p>

The cost of solar water heating systems declined by 30% between 1980 and 
1990.
Further cost reductions will not be as dramatic, but prices will continue 
to
decrease as demand increases and manufacturers take advantage of 
economies of
scale.<p>
