<h2>Advance Statements about Medical Treatment</h2>
<h3>Chris Docker</h3>

<h4>A New Code for the Professions from the
British Medical Association on <i>Living Wills</i></h4>
<P>In 1994 the House of Lords Select Committee
on Medical Ethics called for a Code of Practice on Advance Directives
for health professionals. The BMA took up the challenge and
coordinated a multi-professional group that this month published the
Code as an impressive booklet.
<P>It comes as a 40-page paperback containing the principle points of
the Code expanded with explanatory notes throughout. The main
points are repeated in a concise 16-page insert contained in a back
pocket.
<P>The Code takes immediate pains to point out that there are a wide
variety of advance statements (living wills) under consideration,
including directives, statements of wishes, beliefs and values, triggering
statements, oral statements, notes of a discussion, or the nominating
of a representative. It includes sections on the current legal position,
the drafting of such statements and directives, assessing capacity, and
implementation. Two handy flowcharts are provided - one on the types
of statement (reproduced opposite) and one on the decision-making
process the health care team should follow when confronted by such
a document. The health care team must ask if the statement is a
clear and applicable refusal of treatment, and address such questions
as, is it is valid? is it an emergency? is the patient pregnant? and so
on. A clear framework is given showing when the advance statement
should or shouldn't be followed, and how to act in each particular set
of circumstances. The differences between Scotland, England and
Wales are considered, the liability of health professionals, and the -
situation with regards to conscientious	objection. Finally a very
responsible nine-point <i>minimum requirements</i> list is
appended.
<P>All in all the booklet seems set to have a profound effect on the
attitude of health professionals towards the implementation of living
wills. The BMA clearly have done their homework very well; aware of
some of the pitfalls that the USA has fallen into with its legislation on living
wills dating from 1990, the drafters of the new Code have gone back
to basics to stress the underlying values of the patient that must be
respected, and the place of advance statements in this process. It will
hopefully prove a salutary lesson to the drafters of living wills that
produce overly medicalized or quasi-legal documents, which research
indicates are so ineffective in practice. It will provide an unambiguous
and easily digestible guide to health professionals that have struggled
with the quagmire of confusion and questions over what comprises
ethical conduct and good medical practice if a living will is presented.
Perhaps most importantly, by emphasising the underlying values about
which there is in fact little argument, the Code is an inestimably
important step in reconciling the differences between the
"pro" and "anti" lobbies on this important question.
