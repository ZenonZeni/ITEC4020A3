&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of all the oceans in the world, the Pacific is without a doubt the most fascinating and intriguing body of water.  From Cape Horn to Alaska and from Tasmania to the Kuril Islands, numerous islands dot the azure blue waters of the Pacific.  The variety of these island groups is a diversified as the underwater spectacle of the Pacific.  Scattered in the North Pacific between Hawaii and the Philippines lie the 2,100 islands of Micronesia.  Although these islands cover an ocean area larger than the continental United States, the actual land mass is smaller than Rhode Island.  Within the island group of Micronesia lie two of the most fascinating islands - <B>Yap and Palau</B>.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Yap</B>, the land of giant stone money - is perhaps Micronesia’s most traditional island.  Here we have an opportunity to walk along ancient stone pathways and observe traditional Yapese village life.  We learn how early navigators set out to quarry huge disks of limestone from Palau’s Rock Islands, and ferried them back in their canoes to Yap.  During the winter months large numbers of Manta Rays congregate, and we hope to snorkel at close range with these wonderful leviathans.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The waters of <B>Palau</B> are considered by divers and snorkelers alike to be one of the world’s best snorkel and diving sites.  Teeming with fish (more than 1,400 species) and colorful reefs the waters are nearly as warm as the air.  Five days will be spent on board our chartered luxury yacht, the <I>Sun Dancer II</I>.  During these days we will have ample time to explore some of the most renowned snorkeling sites such as Blue Hole, Turtle Cove, The Wall, Blue Corner and Ngmelis.  We have put together an equally exciting program ashore with excursions to the picturesque Rock Islands and world-famous Jellyfish Lake; a special presentation at the Belau National Museum; and visits to historic World War II sites.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our expeditions will be led by the experienced team of Jack Grove and Dick Dewey.  Both Jack and Dick have been to the Pacific numerous times.  They will accompany us ashore and in the water each day to point out and interpret the myriad wildlife we see and augment our experiences with discussions and informal illustrated lectures.<BR>
