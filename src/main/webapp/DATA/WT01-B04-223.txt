<BR><BR>
<p><FONT SIZE=+2>W</FONT>e accomplished all of our major goals and formed key strategic alliances that will propel our
proprietary "waste-to-glass" technology into worldwide markets.  Our stock price rose from
$4.00 at the beginning of the year to $14.25 at year's end.

<p>	Our success is directly tied to meeting all of our important milestones:  We set out to
form key strategic alliances that would add financial strength, market access, and broadened
capabilities; to complete plant construction and obtain required government operating permits;
and to expand our technology base.  We achieved all this and more.

<br><br>
<p><strong>Strategic Alliances</strong>

<p>	In January 1995, we closed a financing transaction with The Carlyle Group, a
Washington, D.C.-based private merchant bank, making it our controlling shareholder.  Carlyle's
substantial investment in the Company greatly improved our financial position and provided the
resources we needed to rapidly advance our waste-to-glass (vitrification) technology to
commercialization.  Through the experience of its partners, Carlyle also provides GTS Duratek
with unique political insight for working in the government arena.

<p>	In November, we formed an important strategic alliance with BNFL Inc., the U.S.
subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels plc.  This relationship brings additional financial resources
for research and development to the Company.  As one of the   world's largest processors of
high-level radioactive waste, BNFL's selection of GTS Duratek as its strategic ally for
vitrification technology is a significant endorsement.  We have agreed to pursue up to five major
Department of Energy (DOE) environmental restoration projects and to investigate international
opportunities with BNFL.  BNFL is also providing research and development funding over the
next five years to advance our waste treatment technologies.

<br><br>
<p><strong>Construction/Permitting Milestones</strong>

<p>	There were several crucial milestones we absolutely had to achieve on time to meet
contractual commitments made to DOE clients and our joint venture partners.

<p>	Under our DuraChem joint venture with Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc., we set a goal to
have the first vitrification facility for commercially generated low-level radioactive waste
completed before the end of 1995.  In November, DuraChem got its South Carolina operating
permit, and we began the startup of our DuraMelter 3000SC at Chem-Nuclear's low-level
radioactive waste consolidation center in Barnwell, South Carolina.

<p>	We committed to complete construction of the world's largest low-level radioactive waste
melter, our DuraMelter 5000, at the DOE's Savannah River Site "M-Area" by early January 1996. 
On January 10, we informed the client, Westinghouse Savannah River Company, that the facility
was complete and ready for its operational readiness assessment.  We expect to start up and test
the facility during the first half of 1996, and during the 12 months following testing, we will
convert approximately 90,000 cubic feet of radioactive sludge to environmentally safe glass for
long-term storage or disposal.  This is the first commercial-scale application of vitrification
technology for stabilizing DOE waste, and we view the M-Area project as a prototype for future
DOE waste processing privatizations.

<p>	We committed to design a DuraMelter 1000HT (high temperature) pilot-scale melter for
Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Corporation (FERMCO) and have the
components fabricated and delivered to the DOE's Fernald site during the summer of 1995.  As
of early September, all components were on site.  We are also providing consulting support for
FERMCO during construction, startup, and testing of this first-of-a-kind melter facility, which
will process high-radon K-65 silo waste.

<br><br>
<p><strong>Technology and Consulting Expertise</strong>

<p>	In late 1995, with the acquisition of the San Leon, Texas, Bird Gulf Coast Recycling
Center _ now DuraTherm, Inc. _ we entered the business of recycling hazardous waste into
value-added products.  The DuraTherm facility uses patented thermal desorption technology to
extract usable fuel from petroleum refinery and petrochemical plant sludge waste.  The
by-product from the thermal desorption process is a powdery residue, which we believe is an
excellent candidate for conversion to glass that can be reused.  We temporarily suspended
operations at the facility while we make approximately $3 million of capital enhancements, and
we plan to reopen it during the second quarter of 1996.

<p>	We acquired Analytical Resources, Inc., a small environmental consulting firm supplying
specialty environmental consulting services to the DOE.  This acquisition gives us the senior
environmental management and professional consulting talent we will need to further grow our
environmental restoration and waste management services business.

<br><br>
<p><strong>Consulting, Training, and Staff Support</strong>

<p>	Our commercial nuclear power plant and DOE professional and technical services also
grew during 1995.  At Duke Power Company's seven nuclear units, we added engineering and
quality control to the radiation protection, instrumentation &amp; electronic, and clerical support we
are supplying.  We now have contracts to supply radiation protection services for nearly one-fifth
of the nation's commercial nuclear power units, and our staff at the DOE's Fernald site is
approaching 100 technicians.  At the Savannah River M-Area project, we are providing operator
and environment, safety and health (ES&amp;H) training, and a complete radiological
control/industrial safety organization.

<p>	Our shareholders should view GTS Duratek as a company that sets an aggressive
"milestone" agenda each year then goes out and accomplishes it.  We are determined to deliver
on our promises and commitments to our clients and, therefore, to our shareholders.  By meeting
our milestones in 1995, we increased profits by 465 percent over that of 1994.  

<p>	As we go forward, our agenda continues to be aggressive.  We have a plan that includes
adding new technologies to our portfolio that fit with our core mission of implementing
proprietary, low-cost technologies to transform waste into environmentally safe forms for
disposal and, wherever possible, to recycle the material as usable products.  The projects
highlighted on the following pages exemplify our progress and our commitment toward fulfilling
our plan.

<p>	We thank our employees for all their hard work in 1995 and our shareholders for their
continued support.  We are committed to even greater achievements in 1996.

<p>Sincerely,

<br><br>
