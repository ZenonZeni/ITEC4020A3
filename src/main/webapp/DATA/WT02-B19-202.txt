YES  I  CAN!  GUIDELINES</b></center><p> 
 
 
If you would like to nominate a youth or child with a disability for a Yes I Can! Award, please follow the 
directions below:<p> 
<ol> 
<li>	Each applicant must be nominated by TWO people.  Each nomination form must  
	be individually completed and should provide specific information about the  
	nominee.  A form completed by one person and duplicated as the second 
	form will not be accepted.  One of the nominators should be other than a family 
	member. <p> 
 
<li>	Nominee must be selected in one category only and in the same category by 
	both nominators.  Failure to do so will result in an incomplete form and will not 
	be judged by the Selection Committee for the international awards. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Please print or type all information.  It is extremely difficult for the Selection 
	Committee to judge forms that are not legible. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Answer ALL questions. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Photos and news clippings which help to support the nomination are encouraged 
	and may be submitted.  Please do not send video or cassette tapes.  Due to 
	the large volume of nominations received, the Selection Committee does not have 
	the time to view these tapes.  None of the additional material submitted with the 
	application will be returned. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Please be sure to check the box on the nomination form that will indicate which 
	nominator should receive the certificate to present to the nominee.  Certificates 
	will not be sent directly to the nominee. <p> 

 
<li>	Nomination forms must be postmarked no later than January 6, 1997. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Whenever possible, both nomination forms should be returned together.   
	Matching nomination forms that arrive separately adds a considerable amount of 
	time to the selection process. <p> 
 
 
<li>	Send completed forms to:</ol><p>
