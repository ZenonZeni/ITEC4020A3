 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENT </H2>

<P>   The earth is composed of over 100 elements and the most abundant of all of them is oxygen. Oxygen is absolutely essential for the existence of all living matter. We can go for weeks without food and days without water but we cannot live over four minutes without oxygen. There is no other substance on earth that we are so dependent on for our existence. In addition, all living matter contains oxygen, which is combined with other elements, not only as water in all cellular and circulatory fluids, but also as a component of all organic compounds such as carbohydrates (sugars, starches, cellulose, fiber), glycogen, fats and proteins.   Even the clay and rock structures of our soils are loaded with oxygen-containing compounds in the forms of oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulfates and others.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW DO WE GET IT?</H2>
P>   We mostly think of the oxygen in the air we breathe, but it is everywhere.  However, it is a major component in the water we drink and an ingredient of tens of thousands of different molecules that make up our foods. We breathe it, drink it and consume it in our food. Today, we can even supplement with it.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE KINDS OF OXYGEN</H2>
<P>   In its simplest form, oxygen is an atom that exists as one atom all by itself and is referred to just as "O" (singlet oxygen). The most well known and most common form of oxygen is when two atoms of oxygen combine to make molecular oxygen known as 02.</P>
<P>   Many attempts have been made by medical researchers to provide oxygen to the tissues of the body.   Hyperbaric chambers have been developed to put oxygen under pressure, forcing it into the tissues and blood stream.  Ozone is a very reactive form of oxygen that contains three atoms of oxygen and is symbolized by 03. Hydrogen peroxide has been given extensively, both orally and intravenously.</P>
<P>   However, magnesium peroxide is the form of choice today. The magnesium peroxide in Life Plus OXY-GEN CAPS is more stable than regular hydrogen peroxide and when it is utilized in the body it also provides the beneficial mineral, magnesium. Magnesium peroxide is also easier to handle and can be encapsulated in the dry form.  Life Plus OXY-GEN CAPS are an excellent method of supplementing the body with the quality oxygen needed for optimum health for energy, fighting infections and detoxifying.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FREE RADICAL FLAP</H2>
<P>   A commonly misunderstood aspect of hydrogen peroxide is that it is a free radical. This is simply not true. By definition, a free radical has an unpaired electron.  They are very short lived, usually only one ten-thousandth of a second.   If left unchecked, they can cause damage, but they also provide a much needed function in the body as well.  Therefore, balance is always the key. When hydrogen peroxide enters the blood stream, catalase enzyme immediately breaks it down into water and atomic or singlet oxygen. As mentioned above, this singlet oxygen does not exist long enough in the body to harm cells.  As a matter of fact, hydrogen peroxide is formed in the special white blood cells known as macrophages. They have a special enzyme called peroxisome, which produces hydrogen peroxide.  The singlet oxygen they produce literally kills invading bacteria as the singlet oxygen stimulates the oxidation-reduction cycle, which includes detoxification functions in the body as well as the destruction of anaerobic pathogens.</P>
<P>   Environmental contaminates in the air are not only harmful to every cell of our body, but also replaces the amount of oxygen percentage we breathe.  This can result in various problems such as a sense of fatigue, the inability to concentrate, repair of damaged cells and the inability to fight off infection and degenerative diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, the leading causes of death today.   Many researchers believe that the increased discomfort experienced by those suffering from arthritis before a storm or in more humid climates may result from a reduced amount of oxygen in the air.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> OXYGEN DEPLETION</H2>
 <P>  Several factors contribute to oxygen depletion. One of the most overlooked factors that may be contributing to the increased incidence of degenerative disease is the reduction of oxygen content of the air we breathe from about 35% to 19%. This is about a 50% reduction of the oxygen in the air around us.  Mineral deficiencies are another factor.  Minerals help inhibit the formation of toxins in our soils and the lack of minerals throws an extra burden on oxygen.  In addition, overeating can cause oxygen deficiency as more oxygen is required to complete the digestive process and additional metabolic waste.   Improper breathing contributes to the oxygen debt.  All infections reduce oxygen reserves, and researchers have shown that fluoride in our drinking water slows down the process of oxidation of our foods.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ENERGY</H2>
<P>   Probably the most recognized result of decreased quality oxygen uptake in the body is the lack of energy and, on the other hand, increased energy levels are common place with higher levels. Even though the oxygen saturation in the veins of modern man is only 60-70%, some experts see a need for supplementing oxygen to supply up to the 80% range.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FORMULATION</H2>
<P>  Life Plus OXY-GEN CAPS are based on original research and formulation of Dr. Kurt W Donsbach, D.C., N.D., Ph.D. His famous oxygen-saturated aloe vera based formula is meticulously manufactured with cold processed aloe vera used as a stabilized carrier for numerous nutritional constituents, including magnesium peroxide and pure anaerocidal oxygen. Each OXY-GEN capsule contains singlet oxygen equivalent to twelve drops of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide derived from magnesium peroxide and pure anaerocidal oxygen. It is formulated in a proprietary blend of herbs and herbal extracts of Ginkgo Biloba, Ginseng, Suma, Mint Tea, Bee Pollen, Citrus Pectin and Myrr.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUGGESTED USE</H2>
<P>  OXY-GEN CAPS are packaged in bottles of 64 capsules and are recommended to be taken two capsules at one time with water from one to three times per day as desired.  It is recommended that they be taken between meals away from food, at least one-half hour before meals or two hours after. This is simply to help provide for the most efficient absorption. Children usually take one capsule per day for each forty pounds of body weight.</P>


<P>Suggested Use: Two capsules one to three times per day with water as an oxygen supplement at least one-half hour away from food before meals or two hours after. Children usually take one capsule for each 40 pounds of body weight.</P>
