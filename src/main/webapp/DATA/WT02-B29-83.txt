	<STRONG><A NAME="performance">How does NYLBS determine a typical
performance
guarantee arrangement 
with a
client?</A></STRONG><BR>

Performance and service standards are established with each
client, based upon the
client's stated
objectives.  We guarantee the quality of our services and are
prepared to discuss
our contractual
service guarantees with you during our presentation.  In general,
we maintain a
zero defect standard
and continuous quality improvement processes.  We periodically
measure our
performance against
these standards and invite client participation using periodic
performance
questionnaires and
scheduled meetings.
<P>
Examples of our typical performance standards include:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Same-day investment of funds received prior to 4:00 p.m.
ET on a NYSE
business day
	<LI>Same-day transaction processing of requests received
prior to 4:00 p.m.
ET on a NYSE
business day
	<LI>Generation and mailing of distribution and loan checks
within two
business days of receipt of
appropriate paperwork
	<LI>Answering 95% of all participant calls within 2 rings
</UL>

<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="assistance">What kind of assistance does NYLBS provide
during the
conversion
process?</A></STRONG><BR>

NYLBS' conversion specialists will work with you to ensure a
seamless, efficient
conversion to our
401(k) Complete&reg; platform.  We generally need
three
months' lead time to convert a defined contribution plan to our
system.  We will
perform preliminary
auditing and testing of payroll and conversion data to ensure a
smooth transition.
<P>
During the conversion process, we will:

<UL>
<LI>Confirm your current administrative procedures
<LI>Verify your objectives
<LI>Provide a conversion schedule
<LI>Develop priorities and establish responsibilities of all
parties
<LI>Ensure deadlines are met
<LI>Establish administrative protocols.
</UL>
<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="team">Who is part of the NYLBS conversion
team?</A></STRONG><BR>
NYLBS has found that the conversion process goes smoothly when
we use an
established team of
conversion professionals, including a conversion manager,
conversion specialist,
client service
manager, consultant, communications consultant and sales
director.  Once the plan
has been fully
converted, the responsibilities for day-to-day plan
administration will transition
to the NYLBS
recordkeeping account team.

<P>
	<STRONG><A NAME="committed">Is NYLBS  committed to remain in the defined
contribution
business?</A></STRONG><BR>
Our clients are the reason for our existence and success as a
company.  Outstanding
service to our
clients is critical to our future.  Our service reputation and
quality of response
to our clients' needs and
expectations on a day-to-day basis are what distinguish us from
our competition. 
We believe in
continuous training of management and staff and continuous
improvement in our
processes,
capabilities and service offerings.    We are
firmly committed to remain a quality service provider in the
defined contribution
industry.<P>

  <STRONG><A NAME="market">What distinguishes the NYLBS defined contribution
recordkeeping system
from other
systems
on the market?</A></STRONG><BR>
The NYLBS recordkeeping system (PARTS<SUP>&reg;</SUP>) is a proprietary
system
developed, owned
and
maintained by NYLBS. Designed by a team
of in-house specialists to perform either daily or traditional
balance forward
recordkeeping,  the
primary advantage to PARTS is that it was written by
administrators for
administrators.  Unlike many of our
competitors, we
have complete control of software development and modifications
for our system, so we
are not dependent upon third-party software.  In addition,
because our software is
custom designed for our
specific application, the quality of both our operating processes
and staff
training levels is significantly
improved.
