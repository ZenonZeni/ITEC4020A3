<H3>Meeting Standards in the 21st Century. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/coddbio.html">Grahame Codd</A> and Roger Wrayford.</H3>
The paper discusses BNFL's New Oxide Fuels Complex (NOFC). This facility at the Springfields site covers
 the whole oxide fuels manufacturing process, including conversion of UF<SMALL><SUB>6</SMALL></SUB>
 to UO<SMALL><SUB>2</SMALL></SUB>, granulation, 
pelleting, canning, and shipping of finished AGR and LWR fuel. The project was conceived in 1989,
 and was operational by 1995. Its aims were to provide a single manufacturing facility which is capable
 of producing the current 300 t/y of AGR fuel plus over 300 t/y of LWR fuel; is capable of processing
 RepU; meets and surpasses current and planned health and safety legislation by means of its own
 developed technology and working practices; and which removes process inefficiencies, improves
 flexibility and provides for future developments in the RepU market.

<P>
The plant's key concepts are to minimise operator doses, abnormal plant states, and discharges. Firstly
 the plant's physical structures to ensure this are described. Operator doses, particularly from RepU, are
 minimised by built-in shielding, including blockwork walls and thick steel flooring; by the fast tracking
 of uranium through the plant to prevent significant in-growth of U<SMALL><SUB>232</SMALL></SUB> daughters;
 and by the layout of the
 plant, which reduces spread of uranic contamination and exposure to airborne material. There is also both
 primary and secondary containment of the potentially contaminated area, and stringently controlled entry.
 Numbers of operators directly handling material are reduced by 40% compared with existing facilities and high
 degrees of automation are employed. These measures have achieved a plant contamination level of under
  4 Bq/cm<SMALL><SUP>2</SMALL></SUP> and an internal average dose over the last three months of 0.01 mSv, both well under international
 standards. Abnormal plant states are avoided through remote handling and a three level control system, and
 discharge is minimised by control of process, an important quality parameter; and by absolute filtration at source
 to prevent aerial discharges, and recovery of uranium in liquid effluent.

<P>
Secondly human factors which realise the key concepts are described. A Total Quality Management
 philosophy is implemented, and investments made in personnel development. The effectiveness of this
 strategy was demonstrated by the Sizewell order success. Quality is integrated into production activity,
 rather than using a separate quality assurance department. Training schemes ensure a flexible workforce,
 and the concept of teamworking facilitates quality management, also reducing manning levels and bringing
greater ownership and control. Management systems include manufacturing resource planning (MRP II), the
 'just-in-time' principle, and a safety conscious information technology system, with overall control maintained
 by the management information system.

<P>
BNFL's experience with NOFC has demonstrated that its ideals are being met and is confident that it can 
competitively meet 21st century standards for nuclear fuel production.
