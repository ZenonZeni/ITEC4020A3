<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
October 21,1996</I>

<P>
Mr. Greenspan also called attention to the relationship between
inflation and profit margins during the current business cycle.
He reported that profit margins have risen to high levels in the
face of small price increases because of both modest wage growth
and the success which firms have enjoyed in boosting productivity.
If margins now erode because of accelerating wage growth or declining
productivity, firms will come under greater pressure to boost
prices in order to restore profitability.
<P>
<I>Most American forecasters believe that the U.S. corporate sector
will experience a profit squeeze during 1997. </I>On the basis
of the Blue Chip survey of the consensus, forecasters are projecting
a profit gain of only 3.3% during 1997 compared to 9.0% this year.
In 1996, forecasters expect profits to grow at a rate twice the
economy's projected nominal GDP growth rate of 4.6%. In 1997,
by contrast, they are expecting profit growth to lag behind their
estimate of nominal GDP growth of 4.7%. The pessimism of economists
about the profit outlook is not universally shared on Wall Street.
Surveys of corporate profits on the basis of forecasts by company
security analysts suggest that profit growth will be 10-15% next
year. Economists are pessimistic about profits because they believe
that rising wages and slower productivity growth will depress
margins. Analysts implicitly appear to believe that output growth
will either be stronger or that firms will obtain larger price
increases to offset rising wage costs.
<P>
<I>The performance of corporate profits next year will have a
major influence on both the longevity of the current business
cycle and the relative returns provided by debt and equity.</I>
If the corporate sector enjoys 10-15% profit growth during 1997,
the odds are high that output growth will remain close to 3.0%
and set the stage for at least two or three new rounds of Fed
tightening. If earnings growth is only about 3.0%, by contrast,
the odds are high that output growth will slow to only about 2.0%
and that firms will have absorbed rising labor cost pressures
in their profit margins. After declining corporate profits have
depressed investment and employment, the Fed would probably be
able to ease monetary policy during the second half of 1997. There
are sectors of the equity market which could perform well In the
face of a general contraction in profit margins. The winners would
include growth stocks operating independently of the business
cycle, multinational companies able to benefit from a recovery
in Europe and Japan, and financial stocks. But declining profitability
at large labor intensive and cyclical companies would inhibit
the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
<P>
In the early stages of the business cycle, it is possible for
firms to enjoy large increases in output with falling costs because
they enjoy the disinflation effects of depressed utilization rates,
high unemployment and large productivity gains. <I>But as the
business cycle matures and utilization rates rise, it is difficult
to sustain an environment which is positive for both profits and
inflation. </I>Unless wages continue to be insensitive to the
unemployment rate, the economy appears to be entering a zone in
which there will be negative trade-offs between profits and prices.
<P>
It is possible to rationalize the current equity market rally
as a pure liquidity phenomena resulting from easy monetary policy
all over the world. But it is difficult to imagine the U.S. equity
market sustaining its recent robust performance into 1997 if profit
margins are poised to contract as the price of restraining inflation.
In 1995, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan defended the stock market's
high valuation ratios as a reflection of corporate America's success
at boosting profits and developing new technology for enhancing
productivity. His reluctance to speak positively about the U.S.
stock market this autumn may reflect a concern that equity prices
are now exaggerating the corporate sector's ability to sustain
high profit growth without more upward pressure on inflation.
<P>
The financial markets have accepted the verdict of the opinion
polls that President Clinton that will win re-election by a healthy
margin, but they have not yet discounted the risk of a Democratic
takeover of the Congress. Many investors perceive that the American
people like divided government and thus will offset their vote
for the president by voting Republican in the congressional races.
There is no clear historical pattern to the coat-tail effects
of landslide presidential election victories. Ronald Reagan enjoyed
great coat-tails power in 1980 while Lyndon Johnson helped to
elect many Democrats to Congress in 1964, but Richard Nixon had
little drawing power in the congressional races during 1972 while
the Reagan re-election landslide of 1984 had only a modest impact
on the congressional races. <I>The fact is almost two thirds of
U.S. presidential elections since 1920 have been characterized
by landslide victories (margins over 10%). </I>Incumbent presidents
who enjoy successful first terms which do not generate primary
opposition also tend to expand their victory margins when seeking
re-election (Roosevelt in 1936, Eisenhower in 1956, Nixon in 1972
and Reagan in 1984). As a result, there would be nothing unique
about Clinton winning re-election with a victory margin of 10-15%
or what the opinion polls have been predicting recently. Political
analysts will long ponder the president's seeming immunity to
personal and financial scandals as well as his ability to shift
his extraordinary ideological profile so effectively, but the
voters appear to be reacting to perceptions of the economy and
the general international environment, not the issue of character
or partisan disagreements about tax policy. According to the University
of Michigan survey of consumer confidence during September, the
public has a more positive view of government economic policy
today than at any time since mid-1988.
