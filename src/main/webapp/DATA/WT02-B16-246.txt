<H2>Case Study: Electricity for a Modern Home</H2>

<P>
When the Chases moved to their PV-powered home in the wilds of
southwest Florida, they were able to bring along all of their
electrical appliances. 

<p>

<font color="#F79D00">Integrating PV into a home doesn't have to be complicated. A
project partially funded by DOE and led by Fully Independent
Residential Solar Technology (FIRST), Inc., focuses on
incorporating PV products into the increasingly popular modular,
manufactured house.</font> 
<br clear=all>

<p>When Joyce and George Chase discovered it would cost $15,000 to
extend a utility line to their new home on the Peace River in
southwest Florida, they decided instead to use a stand-alone PV
system to power their appliances and lights. George, whose
weekend cabin on the same site had been powered by a stand-alone
PV system and battery, designed the house from scratch with the
cooperation of the local building inspector. 

<p>Today, a visitor to this modern 185-m<sup>2</sup> (2000-ft<sup>2</sup> ) home would
never guess there is no utility power. All fixtures, outlets, and
electrical appliances are standard. Although most of the Chases
appliances operate on <a href="acdc.html">dc</a>, an <a href="balance4.html">inverter</a>
 converts some of their dc
power stored in <a href="balance3.html">batteries</a> to ac for those that require ac power.
George put the battery and control rooms in a central spot that
shortened the length of wire needed, keeping costs down and
increasing efficiency. Based on advice from the inspector, George
installed larger-gauge wire for the dc circuits. Today, the
Chases have all the conveniences of the city, from a hair dryer
and a microwave oven, to a clothes washer, TV, and ceiling fans.
