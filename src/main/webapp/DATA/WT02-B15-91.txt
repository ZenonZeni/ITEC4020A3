<h1>Group Self-Insurance For Workers&#146; Compensation: What are
the Benefits?</h1>

<p><em>By Dan Lewis, Manager, Account Services</em></p>

<hr color="#008080">

<p>When commercial insurance carriers began leaving the
workers&#146; compensation marketplace in the mid to late
1980&#146;s, group self-insurance became a viable workers&#146;
compensation solution for many healthcare organizations. In fact,
these market conditions brought about the creation of the five
workers&#146; compensation groups that Specialty Insurance
Services, Inc. manages today:</p>

<ul>
    <li><font color="#008080">Healthcare Providers group</font></li>
    <li><font color="#008080">MHA Private Workers&#146;
        Compensation Group</font></li>
    <li><font color="#008080">MHA Public Workers&#146;
        Compensation Group</font></li>
    <li><font color="#008080">SunHealth Group Self-Insurance
        Association of North Carolina</font></li>
    <li><font color="#008080">THA-Workers&#146; Compensation
        Group</font></li>
</ul>

<p>These groups continue to provide their members many advantages
that cannot be obtained in the commercial marketplace. In
addition to providing a long-term, stable workers&#146;
compensation market, groups provide the following advantages:</p>

<p><font color="#008080">Cost reduction</font>-Since groups
eliminate many expenses that would be incurred with insurance
companies, such as insurance company profits and assigned risk
charges, members generally see reduced costs. Investment income
earned by the group also reduces overall costs.</p>

<p><font color="#008080">Specialized services</font>-loss control
and claims services are tailored to meet the specific needs of
the group&#146;s members. This can result in improved loss
experience, which further reduces the members&#146; cost.</p>

<p><font color="#008080">Self-governance</font>-a group is
governed by an elected board, which makes decisions on behalf of
the members of the group. This allows the members to make
decisions concerning the direction and operation of the group.</p>

<p><font color="#008080">Ownership</font>-members of the group
share in the equity (profit) of generated by the operation of the
group. This is contrasted with a commercial carrier, where the
profits stay with the insurance company.</p>
