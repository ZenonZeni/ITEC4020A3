<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>COMMENTS OF MEDIA ACCESS PROJECT, CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY
AND TECHNOLOGY, THE BENTON FOUNDATION ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION, AND
VOTERS TELECOMMUNICATIONS WATCH </H3>

<P>Media Access Project, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Benton
Foundation, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Voters Telecommunications
Watch (hereinafter collectively referred to as &quot;Commenters&quot;),
respectfully submit the following comments in response to the Commission's
<I>Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Third Report and Order, and Notice of
Inquiry</I>, released December 24, 1996 in the above referenced docket
(&quot;<I>NPRM</I>&quot;). These organizations represent the interests
of the public, including both current and future users of the Internet
and similar interactive computer networks. Specifically, Commenters address
these comments to the portions of the <I>NPRM</I> that consider whether
to &quot;permit incumbent LECs to assess interstate access charges on information
service providers.&quot; <I>NPRM</I> at &para;&para;282-90. </P>

<H3>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE COMMISSION SHOULD CONSIDER THE
EFFECTS OF THIS PROCEEDING ON THE ABILITY OF ALL AMERICANS TO ENGAGE IN
ONLINE SPEECH AND TO HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO INFORMATION.</H3>

<P>Commenters urge the Commission to keep in mind that the issues presented
in this section of the <I>NPRM</I> have an impact which goes far beyond
the profitability of the industries involved or the alleged congestion
to the public switched voice network. The Commission has erroneously focused
only on the conflict between incumbent LECs and the information services
industry, and has downplayed the needs of information service <B><I>users</I></B>.<A NAME="bod1"></A><SUP><A HREF="#fn1">1</A></SUP>
In the <I>NPRM</I>, the Commission notes that the information services
<B><I>industry</I></B> has grown dramatically, and recites the policy of
the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-104 (1996)(&quot;Act&quot;),
as well as its own longstanding goal, to avoid unnecessary regulation of
this industry. <I>NPRM</I> at &para;282. It posits, however, that there
may be an increasing effect from such services on the public switched network,
and it asks how its rules can provide &quot;incentives for investment and
innovation in the underlying networks that support the Internet and other
information services.&quot; <I>Id.</I> at &para;&para;282-83. Moreover,
in tentatively concluding to continue to apply the existing rate structure
to ISPs, it states that a central concern is the &quot;potentially detrimental
effects&quot; on the information services industry. <I>Id.</I> at &para;288.</P>

<P>What is absent from this discussion is any mention of the effects <B><I>on
the citizens</I></B> who use or benefit from the use of information services.
Indeed, the Internet has assumed an important and growing role in the social,
economic, and political life of its users. Thus, if the Commission regulates
the information services industry, it would also regulate an arena of citizen
speech and political discourse; a measureless source of information and
entertainment; and an efficient, international means of commerce.<A NAME="bod2"></A><SUP><A HREF="#fn2">2</A></SUP>
Furthermore, Commenters believe, under the Communications Act's mandate
that the FCC ensure that common carrier rates remain &quot;just and reasonable,&quot;
47 USC &sect;201, the Commission cannot limit the debate by overlooking
the impact on the users of the Internet. Thus, the Commission must also
consider how a change in the rate structure for ISPs would affect this
new means of expression and communication, and whether it would limit the
ability of lower-income Americans to access the Internet. </P>

<H3>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE COMMISSION SHOULD CONTINUE TO
APPLY THE EXISTING PRICING STRUCTURE TO INFORMATION SERVICES PROVIDERS.
</H3>

<P>Commenters applaud the Commission's tentative conclusion that the existing
pricing structure for information services providers &quot;should remain
in place at this time.&quot; <I>NPRM</I> at &para;283. As it has observed
throughout the <I>NPRM</I>, the Commission notes that the existing access
charge regime &quot;includes non-cost-based rates and inefficient rate
structures,&quot; and should not be extended to an additional class of
users, especially the still-evolving information services industry. <I>Id.</I>
at &para;288.</P>

<P>Commenters agree with this conclusion that, on legal and policy grounds,
the Commission should continue to exempt ISPs from the current access charge
structure. Imposing these fees would risk quashing the broad participation
and high accessibility of what has become a highly important mode of speech.
The Commission should only discontinue the exemption - if at all - after
careful consideration, and in any event not until after the existing access
charge structure is r formed.</P>

<P>The Internet has become a significant mode of democratic participation,
and imposing access charges could have enormous detrimental impact on its
market penetration as well as its egalitarian and open nature. <I>See NPRM</I>
at &para;288. These usage-based fees might be borne by ISPs, at the risk
of causing industry fallout, or passed on to consumers, which could diminish
total use and especially limit use by lower-income citizens.<A NAME="bod3"></A><SUP><A HREF="#fn3">3</A></SUP>
In either event, this is a major decision with far-reaching implications
not only for the industry, but for citizen speech and access to information.</P>

<P>By many accounts, the Internet has experienced rapid growth precisely
because government has not extensively regulated it. <I>See</I> Act, &sect;230(a)(4).
More specifically, it has allowed service providers to compete freely with
flexible pricing options that respond to user needs. This flexibility and
competition is beneficial, especially in such a rapidly growing and evolving
industry. The Commission should, therefore, be very careful before imposing
a new pricing structure, and should closely examine its need and probable
impact.</P>

<P>The <I>Notice of Inquiry</I> which was initiated as part of the <I>NPRM</I>
proposes to conduct exactly this type of exacting scrutiny, <I>NPRM</I>
at &para;&para;311-18, and Commenters believe it would be a better forum
to examine these questions. Indeed, the Commission heard a large body of
testimony at its Bandwidth Forum on January 23, 1997, that shows that there
are many broad, complex questions surrounding capital investments, technology,
and the economics of both voice networks and interactive computer networks.
These are the type of questions, and will have the type of long term implications,
that merit the careful study of a separate proceeding.</P>

<P>Before determining whether to apply access charges to ISPs, the Commission
should wait until it has better determined how it will reform these charges
as a whole. Existing fees have been widely denounced as inefficient and
unfair, and the <I>NPRM</I> proposes to make several changes in their structure.
It would be arbitrary in the extreme to impose these charges on a fledgling
industry, especially when their structure is in flux. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CONCLUSION</H3>

<P>In light of the likely change in access rates; the undetermined impact
upon the public switched networks, ISPs, and Internet speakers and users;
and the rapidly changing nature of the Internet and data network technologies,
application of the interstate access charge regime to ISPs would be fraught
with risk, at least at this time. Commenters agree with the commission's
assessment that, &quot;[There is] no reason to extend this regime to an
additional class of users...&quot; </P>

<HR WIDTH="50%"><A NAME="fn1"></A><A HREF="#bod1">1</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed,
to the extent that greater, more robust speech rights and participation
in civic activities benefit all members of society, this decision will
affect <B><I>all</I></B> citizens.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn2"></A><A HREF="#bod2">2</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>See</I>
Appendix A for a list of examples of politically oriented web sites and
newsgroups, which is also available online at: <A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/internet_bomb.test.html#appendixA">&lt;http://www.cdt.org/policy/terrorism/internet_bomb
.test.html#appendixA&gt;</A>. The significance of the Internet as a means
of speech and source of information has been recognized recently both by
the courts and Congress. &quot;It is no exaggeration to conclude that the
Internet has achieved, and continues to achieve, the most participatory
marketplace of mass speech that this country - and indeed the world - has
yet seen.&quot; <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>, 929 F.Supp. 824 (E.D. Pa. 1996)(opinion
of Dalzell, J.). Congress found in the 1996 Act that the Internet and other
computer services &quot;represent an extraordinary advance in the availability
of educational and informational resources to our citizens....[and] offer
a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities
for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity.&quot;
Act, &sect;230(a)(1), (a)(3).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn3"></A><A HREF="#bod3">3</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commenters
wish to clarify, however, that this statement addresses both possible effects
of the imposition of fees, and makes no attempt at this time to estimate
the probability whether such fees would be borne by ISPs or passed on to
consumers.</P>
