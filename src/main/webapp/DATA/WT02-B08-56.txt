<h1>Plastic Surgery</h1><hr size=4><p>



<font size=4><b>History</b></font><br>

Although the word &quot;plastic&quot; is used in this medical specialty, most surgeries performed in this field do not use plastic.  The term was initially used to explain the shaping and molding of various features.  Modern plastic surgery developed following World War II, when scores of British airmen sustained grave facial disfigurement during battle.  Doctors created new techniques to reshape their faces and eventually the term &quot;plastic surgery&quot; was used to describe the vocation.<p>



<font size=4><b>Type of Plastic Surgery</b></font><br>

There are two categories of plastic surgery - <i>reconstructive</i> and <i>cosmetic</i>.<br>

<i>Reconstructive plastic surgery</i> is used in a wide variety of medical cases including:<br>

<dd>

<ul>

<li>birth defects

<li>cancer reconstruction

<li>severe burns

<li>facial trauma

<li>skin tumors

<li>hand surgery

</dl></ul><p>



 

<i>Cosmetic plastic surgery</i> is a voluntary surgery performed to improve or enhance a physical feature.<br> The most common cosmetic surgeries include:<br>

<dd>

<ul>

<li>liposuction

<li>breast enlargement

<li>breast reduction

<li>breast lift

<li>rhinoplasty (nose)

<li>face lift

<li>chin or cheek implant

<li>eyelid lift

<li>fat grafting

</dl></ul><p>





<font size=4><b>Is Cosmetic Surgery Right for Everyone?</b></font><br>

Thousands of people choose to have cosmetic surgery every year and are thrilled with the results.  But it is important to note that cosmetic surgery is a physical and emotional decision.  Not only must there be enough probability that the area may be surgically corrected or enhanced, but the patient must also be emotionally ready to alter the chosen physical feature.<p>



<font size=4><b>How to Choose a Plastic Surgeon</b></font><br>

There are several factors to consider when deciding on a plastic surgeon:<br>

<dd><ol>

	<li><b>Recommendations.</b>   Ask friends or family who have had plastic surgery about their doctor.  There is no substitute for first hand knowledge.<p>



	<li><b>Qualifications.</b>   Be sure the surgeon is Board Certified or Board Eligible.  Most qualified surgeons are also members of  the ASPRS (American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons).<p>



	<li><b>Experience.</b>  Choose a surgeon who is well-trained and experienced in the surgery you are pursuing.  You may wish to speak with more than one doctor to obtain this information.<p>



	<li><b>Comfort Level.</b>    You need to feel comfortable with the surgeon and confident that he/she understands your needs and concerns.</ol></dl><p>
