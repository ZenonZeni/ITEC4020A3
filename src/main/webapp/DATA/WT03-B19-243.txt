Melbourne : Australia's business capital
</H1>

Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria, is strategically placed to 
serve as a gateway to the world's most dynamic region, Asia, which 
has achieved substantial real economic growth during the past 20 years 
and now accounts for about 40% of world GNP. Melbourne's time zone is 
two hours ahead of Beijing's, one hour ahead of Tokyo's and overlaps with 
the trading hours of the American west coast, which is a major advantage 
for firms that have regional business links.
<BR>
<BR>
Melbourne is home to many of Australia's top corporations. Six of Australia's ten
largest corporations and seven of Australia's ten largest foreign organisations 
have their head offices in Melbourne.
<BR>
<BR>
A 1995 summary by the accounting firm, Price Waterhouse and the geographic 
research company, MapInfo, into Australia's major growth zones found 
that Melbourne contained 37 such zones, more than any other Australian 
city. The zones, equating to local government areas, were identified on 
the basis of low unemployment, high population growth, high retail sales, 
high disposable income and strong housing commencement activity.
<BR>
<BR>
With a metropolitan population of about three million, Melbourne is also 
strategically located in Australia's south-east where most of the nations 
consumer and industrial markets are situated and where about 70% of 
the population are living.
