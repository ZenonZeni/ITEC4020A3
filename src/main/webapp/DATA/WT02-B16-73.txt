<i>A Letter From The Secretary Of Energy</i>
<p>
The National campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is not
just an environmental mission.  Energy efficiency and renewable
energy are economic "wins" for participants in "Energy Partnerships
for a Strong Economy:  A Better Climate for Jobs."
<p>
Business, industry, States, local communities and consumers benefit
from new job opportunities; more affordable housing; cleaner air;
and a sustainable, and therefore stable, economic base of business
and industry.  Citizens benefit from redirection of 
their tax dollars into reduced energy costs.  Industries enjoy new
cost savings, smaller energy bills and renewed viability through
the direct and indirect benefits of emerging technologies and the
jobs they create.  And yes, America's children will enjoy
 a cleaner environment.
<p>
DOE's "Energy Partnerships for a Strong Economy" is not a new
bureaucracy.  It is a fresh, innovative approach to environmental
quality and economic growth designed to leverage Federal dollars
through partnerships with private industry. These activities 
do not duplicate, but rather incorporate, existing State and
Federal programs and accelerate their benefits.
<p>
Above all, "Energy Partnerships for a Strong Economy" is flexible
enough to meet the needs of our diverse Nation, while focused
enough to achieve America's economic and environmental goals.
<p>
Whether you are a large corporation, a small business, or a town or
county, DOE can provide you with more information on a range of
actions that make economic and environmental sense.

<p>
If you have a question, an idea, a comment, or want to participate,
call us at <b>1-800-DOE-EREC.</b>
<p>
Sincerely,<p>

Hazel O'Leary (signature)<p>
Secretary of Energy
