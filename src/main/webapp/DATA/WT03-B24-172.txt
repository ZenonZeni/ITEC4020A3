SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE) --Dec. 20, 1995--Terrapin Technologies,
Inc., a privately held pharmaceutical discovery company, has received another
$2 million from both current and new investors, and completed its mezzanine
financing with a total of $13.7 million invested.<BR>
<BR>
Lead mezzanine investors are funds under management by Hambrecht &amp; Quist
Capital Management.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have exceeded our goal for this financing and are very encouraged
by the strong vote of confidence.&quot; said Clifford Orent, company chairman
and chief executive officer. &quot;As we forge ahead our near-term focus
is on product candidates which address major medical needs in the fields
of oncology/hematology and diabetes. We believe our novel treatment approaches
represent significant breakthroughs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Terrapin's lead product candidate, TER199, is a novel, orally active molecule
which addresses the $1 billion colony stimulating factor market. The company's
goal with this product is to provide a single, oral therapy that can protect
and restore bone marrow in patients undergoing chemotherapy.<BR>
<BR>
Therapeutic applications include rescuing cancer patients from myelosuppression
after chemotherapy, treating neutropenia, enhancing bone marrow transplantation,
stimulating platelet growth, and treating thrombocytopenia.<BR>
<BR>
Preclinical (in vivo) studies have shown that TER199 has the extraordinary
capability to accelerate the reappearance of circulating neutrophils, platelets,
erythrocytes and lymphocytes following their suppression by cytotoxic agents.
Terrapin's objective is to file an investigational new drug application
(IND) in 1996 to initiate human clinical studies.<BR>
<BR>
Terrapin's diabetes program is focused on a family of compounds, including
TER3938, which directly activate the human insulin receptor and could lead
to a major advance in the $3 billion diabetes market.<BR>
<BR>
The company believes that its treatment approach offers the opportunity
to more effectively regulate glucose and insulin plasma diabetes. In preclinical
(in vivo) models of type II (adult onset) diabetes, TER3938 has been shown
to lower blood glucose and circulating insulin levels.<BR>
<BR>
The company is now applying its medicinal chemistry expertise to identify
a novel compound based on TER3938 for entry into human clinical studies.<BR>
<BR>
Terrapin is building a portfolio of product candidates targeting unmet medical
needs in oncology/hematology, diabetes and immunology. Working with corporate
partners and on its own behalf, the company is utilizing its proprietary
molecular fingerprinting technology, known as TRAP (TM), to rapidly identify
small-molecule drug candidates which offer significant medical potential.<BR>
<BR>
This powerful technology allows the discovery of therapeutic leads from
large chemical libraries at an unprecedented level of efficiency.<BR>
<BR>
Terrapin is located in South San Francisco, California<BR>
