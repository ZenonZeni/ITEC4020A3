<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>HISTORY</B></H2>
<P>The SAA was founded in 1991 when the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators (WASDA) and the Association of Wisconsin School Administrators (AWSA) joined their advocacy efforts. With the addition of the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials in 1992 and the Wisconsin Council of Administrators of Special Services (WCASS) in 1994, the SAA has grown to represent virtually every licensed school administrator in the State of Wisconsin. This increasingly diverse membership provides a broad perspective and a deep understanding of educational issues.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>MISSION</B></H2>
<P>To advocate on behalf of school administrators in their efforts to strengthen Wisconsin's national leadership in education so that our children receive a world class education.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>ADVOCACY</B></H2>
<P>The SAA's diverse membership is united by a commitment to continuously improve the quality of Wisconsin public education. The SAA will support legislation which focuses on the following basic principles:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The education of our children must be state government's primary purpose. The state must adhere to its constitutional obligation to &quot;provide by law for the establishment of district schools, which shall be as nearly uniform as practicable,&quot; and &quot;free and without charge for tuition to all children between the ages of 4 and 20 years.&quot;</LI>
<LI>All children deserve to receive an education that meets their needs and abilities.</LI>
<LI>There must be coordination among school programs and community-based programs to ensure that the whole child receives attention.</LI>
<LI>Parents must be active participants in the education of their children, from birth to graduation.</LI>
<LI>Standards must be established by which parents, communities, and government can determine the quality of education provided to our children and measure their performance.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The SAA legislative agenda, which is published annually, outlines legislative positions and the beliefs they are based on in the following areas:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Educational Programs</LI>
<LI>Finance and Facilities</LI>
<LI>School Governance</LI>
<LI>Support of Educational Leaders</LI>

</UL>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>SERVICE</B></H2>
<P>The SAA serves as a vehicle for members to collectively advance the policy deliberations of today's most important educational issues. For example, every year the SAA sponsors project teams consisting of volunteers from around the state who are interested, have expertise and are willing to work intensively to analyze issues that impact upon the children educated in Wisconsin. Through their work these teams serve our members and the public alike.</P>
<P>If you would like information on current project team proposals, please contact the SAA.</P>
