<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Toxic organic and inorganic contaminants in waste streams generated by chemical, metallurgical, and other industries must be destroyed or removed before the waste streams are released to the environment.  The activities of the DOE alone could generate more than 200,000 m3 of aqueous mixed waste, contaminated with both toxic organics and metals, that would require treatment over the next 20 years.
<P>
Many researchers have undertaken extensive studies of photocatalytic techniques assisted by titanium dioxide (TiO2) for the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from aqueous waste streams.  These techniques have been proven effective for oxidative destruction of the most resistant organic compounds and for reduction of several heavy metals.  However, reduction of toxic heavy metal ions, such as lead (Pb2+), had not been reported.

<B>Argonne's technology holds promise for remediating groundwater contaminated with long-lived radioactive materials.</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
Successful application of the technology would enable removal, detoxification, and recovery of heavy metals, along with the destruction of organics in combined waste streams.  This would represent a significant breakthrough for the treatment of heavy-metal-contaminated waters at DOE and industrial sites.  By recovering the metals in metallic form, heavy-metal toxicity is minimized, and the number of steps required for recovery is reduced.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Basic research on surface modification of colloidal TiO2, which was conducted by Argonne National Laboratory's Chemistry Division, is being applied by Argonne's Energy Systems Division to develop materials that effectively remove lead and mercury ions from aqueous solutions.  The goal is to develop an industrial process for selective heavy-metal recovery and simultaneous removal of organic and metal contaminants from aqueous waste streams.
<P>
Argonne chemists are using metal-binding peptides and related mercapto-reagents to modify the particle surface of TiO2 colloids.  Surface modification enhances the reduction properties of conduction band electrons, yielding materials that are selectively optimized for photochemical reactivity towards toxic metal ions.  In parallel research, Energy Systems engineers and scientists are conducting batch, bench-scale experiments on aqueous solutions containing various metal and organic contaminants to determine process kinetics and optimal treatment conditions.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Preliminary results indicate that in solutions containing lead only, the surface-modified catalyst reduces lead ions effectively.  In lead-phenol and lead-naphthalene solutions, the presence of lead has little effect on phenol or naphthalene degradation.  Phenol does not appear to affect removal of lead ions significantly.  Naphthalene, however, by absorbing ultraviolet light, interferes with the illumination of colloid particles and deters the photocatalytic process.  Reduction in lead concentration is delayed until a significant portion of naphthalene is degraded.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne researchers will design methods for metal and catalyst recovery and will test other compounds for surface modification of TiO2 colloid particles.  Systems and economic analyses will be performed, and a continuous flow treatment process will be designed and tested.
