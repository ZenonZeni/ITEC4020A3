During 1994, the department conducted clinical and basic research in a variety of areas. This work involved clinical populations with major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, acute mania, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, stroke, and other psychiatric and neurological populations. The department provided primary clinical services through its Memory Disorders Center, Huntington's Chorea Center, Late Life Depression Center, Electroconvulsive Therapy Service, and inpatient depression subunit. The department also provides the clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) service at the New York State Psychiatric Institute.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Federal funding was continued from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for research on the affective and cognitive consequences of electroconvulsive therapy (Principal Investigator: Dr. Sackeim; Co-Principal Investigators: Drs. Devanand and Prudic), continuation pharmacological treatment following response to ECT (Principal Investigator: Dr. Sackeim; Co-Principal Investigator: Dr. Prudic), and the treatment of psychosis and behavioral disturbance in Alzheimer's disease (Principal Investigator: Dr. Devanand). The MERIT Award to Dr. Sackeim on the affective and cognitive consequences of ECT was renewed for another five years. The conclusion of this next funding period will represent 20 years of continuous research aimed at improving this form of treatment.

New R01 support was received from the National Institute of Mental Health for a study of the predictors of questionable dementia (Principal Investigator: Dr. Devanand). Many older individuals report deficits in their cognitive functioning, but it is often difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in such cases. This study uses functional and structural brain imaging and neuropsychological measures to identify early signs of incipient Alzheimer's disease. This project received a supplement to add MRI measures of hippocampal atrophy as another predictor. Another new R01 from the National Institute of Mental Health concerns the pharmacological treatment of dysthymia in the elderly (Principal Investigator: Dr. Devanand). This work involves a random assignment, placebo-controlled trial, assessing the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine as treatment for chronic mild depression in late life. The study is conducted in the Late Life Depression Research Center.

The National Institute of Aging (NIA) continued support for a large program project grant on the epidemiology of Alzheimer's disease in Northern Manhattan (Principal Investigator: Dr. Mayeux), for a study of the predictors of the course of Alzheimer's disease (Principal Investigator: Dr. Stern), and for the Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Research Center (Principal Investigator: Dr. Shelanski). NIA funding continued for a project on the neuropathology of schizophrenia, involving collaborations among the Divisions of Brain Imaging and Neuropathology and Neurotoxicology, and the Department of Biological Psychiatry (Principal Investigator: Dr. Prohovnik).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The department is also participating in the center grant from the Memory Loss and Aging Consortium of the Charles A. Dana Foundation (Center Directors: Drs. E. Kandel and R. P. Rowland), with Drs. Mayeux and Sackeim each as principal investigators on projects within the center. New findings to emerge in this research included the first demonstration that pre-existing cognitive impairment in the context of major depression predisposes to more severe and persistent amnesia following ECT.

Dr. Sackeim was named an Honorary Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, the Jules Roth Scholar in Residence at the State University of New York in Purchase, and he received the Joel Elkes International Award from the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

The following sections highlight the new research conducted in the Huntington's Chorea Center and the Memory Disorders Center.

<B>Huntington's Disease Center</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Huntington's Disease Center at the New York State Psychiatric Institute was opened in October 1991 to offer diagnostic, treatment, and counseling services to Huntington's disease patients and families. Services include neurological, neuropsychological, and psychiatric assessments as well as social work services.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Since its inception, the Center has served over 100 people and their families and is actively following approximately 70 patients, making this Center one of the largest in the country. The Center is staffed by two neurologists, a psychiatric attending and resident, a nurse practitioner, and a social worker. Over the past three years training has been provided for two fellows in movement disorders, four psychiatric residents each spending six months in the Center, three genetic counseling students, and four social work graduate students.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1993, Columbia University became part of the Huntington's Study Group, a group of 20 Centers throughout the United States and Canada who have created a collective database and systematic examination forms, with the goal of conducting large multi-center therapeutic interventions for Huntington's disease. Our Center has been an active participant in these efforts.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As part of the Huntington's Study Group, we are currently participating in a phase II trial of OPC-14117, a powerful antioxidant, in a double-blind placebo-controlled, parallel design. This study is being conducted at the Irving Center for Clinical Research at Presbyterian Hospital.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Memory Disorders Center</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Memory Disorders Center continues to serve its role as a diagnostic and treatment center for dementia disorders. The center evaluates approximately 200 new patients yearly and has over 200 patients on its active follow-up roster at any time. Through its role as the primary diagnostic site for the Center for Alzheimer's Disease clinical core, the center serves as a referral resource for ongoing dementia research.

To determine whether limited educational or occupational attainment are risk factors for incident dementia, 593 non-demented individuals age 60 or older in a registry of elders at-risk for dementia in North Manhattan were identified and followed for one to four years. The risk of dementia was increased in subjects with either low education (RR=2.02; <BR>
1.33-3.06) or low lifetime occupational attainment (RR=2.25; 1.32-3.84). Risk was greatest for subjects with both low education and low lifetime occupational attainment (RR=2.87; 1.32-3.84). The findings suggested that increased educational and occupational attainment may reduce the risk of incident AD, either by decreasing the ease of clinical detection of AD, or by imparting a reserve that delays the onset of clinical manifestations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We have also examined age at symptom onset of AD as a predictor of rate and pattern of cognitive decline. Forty-four early (onset before age 65) and 83 late onset patients were compared. Although early and late onset subjects were comparable at baseline for overall dementia severity on the modified Mini-Mental State exam, there was significantly more rapid decline in early onset subjects after two years of follow-up. The results provided longitudinal evidence of more rapid cognitive decline in subjects with early onset Alzheimer's disease, and suggest that early onset AD may be characterized by predominant impairment of attentional skills.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To examine whether extrapyramidal signs (EPS) or psychotic features are associated with more rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease, 236 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease were recruited in three cities and followed semiannually. Using Cox proportional hazards models which adjusted for age, sex, disease severity, and estimated duration of illness at study entry, the presence of EPS at entry was associated with higher relative risk of reaching the endpoints of moderate cognitive impairment (RR=2.35, 95% CI=1.12-4.92) or severe functional impairment (2.31, 1.37-3.90), nursing home entry (2.51, 1.32-4.76), or death (3.04, 1.31-7.05). Psychosis predicted only the functional endpoint (1.85,1.18-2.90). This study confirmed that EPS and psychosis are robust predictors of disease endpoints and rapid progression in Alzheimer's disease.
