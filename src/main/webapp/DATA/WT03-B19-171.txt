<P>
Victoria has an immigrant population drawn from nearly 160 nationalities.
<P>
About 25 per cent of the present population was born outside Australia
and about 16 pr cent of the present population was born in non-English
speaking countries.  Many of these are from Asian countries, including
45,000 people from China and Hong Kong; 62,000 from India; 23,000
from Malaysia; 16,000 from the Philippines and 44,000 from Vietnam.
<P>
Because of the high number of first- and second-generation Asian
immigrants in Victoria, and the high priority accorded to teaching
Asian languages in Victorian schools and universities, knowledge
of these languages is widespread.

management and finance'</h3>

The Strategic Industry Research Foundation (SIRF) is a Victorian
Government initiative whose mission is to contribute to the State's
economic development by fostering the application of R&amp;D and
other innovative strategies to improve business performance.
<P>
SIRF encourages collaboration between industry, enterprises, and
private and public sector research organisations. SIRF also develops
sources of funding for strategic R&amp;D.
<P>
Since 1990, SIRF has attracted investment of more than $US94.2
million from public and private sector organisations to conduct
industry led R&amp;D collaborations.
<P>
Major industry led initiatives have been established in information
technology, agricultural research, alternative energy technologies,
marine and heavy engineering, biotechnology and industrial
maintenance. Market driven R&amp;D and innovation programs are
also
underway in telecommunications, facilities management, food
manufacturing, automotive components, aerospace, and waste
and environmental management.
