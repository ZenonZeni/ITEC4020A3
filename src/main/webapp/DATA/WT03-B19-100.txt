Gimps and the GOP - Monday, August 12

<H3>Monday, August 12</H3>
<H2>Shiny Happy People</H2>

<p>SAN DIEGO - There are times when being in a wheelchair gives me something of a Moses complex.
<p>I roll up to the Convention Center this morning, and . . . eek . . . between me and the metal detectors there lies an angry throng of abortion protesters.  Two throngs, actually - one pro-life, the other pro-choice.  And both of them are angrier than shit.  Now, my usual response when I see large throngs of angrier-than-shit people is to get as far away as I can as fast as I can - especially when they're angry about abortion, an issue which just seems to bring out the worst in both sides.  But I had no choice this time.  I was going to have to plow right through them.
<p>It'd be cool if I could say I went in at ramming speed, swinging my detachable footrests with kneecap-shattering accuracy and cutting a bloody swath through the sea of fanaticism - but no such luck.  This crowd did what every crowd does when it sees me coming: It parted before me like the friggin' Red Sea, that's what.  Normally, I find this quite convenient - I just wish it made for better copy, that's all.
<hr>
<p>One thing's for sure: You won't be hearing much about abortion within the convention hall itself.  There's been little or none of the Family Values rhetoric that scared voters away from the GOP in 1992.  Hell, even Pat Robertson is telling everyone that the abortion plank in the platform doesn't matter and that the real issues are taxes and welfare reform.  If I hear the word "tolerant" one more time, I'm going to start wondering if I'm at Woodstock.
<p>Of course, there's always the odd delegate who simply won't get with the program.  Colin Powell's declaration that he is pro-choice on abortion and in favor of affirmative action was greeted with more than a few boos from the convention floor.  (Did you hear them on TV, or does the Republican National Committee have a "boo-filter" set up to keep all but happy thoughts from making it out over the airwaves?)  And on the way out of the Convention Center, as I was passing a gay-rights demonstration in the official "free-speech area" (a fenced-in parking lot which has been designated as a safe play area for various activist groups), I heard some woman behind me gasp with disgust and say, "I'll just bet that the media will give those faggots just as much time as Colin Powell!"
<p>Strangely enough, that little dose of narrow-minded bigotry made me feel a lot better.  Too much love combined with politics and I start getting twitchy.
<hr>
<p>So I guess Colin Powell is the designated Child of Immigrants for this convention.  The Democrats do it, too - it's a required element for one of these shindigs, I suspect - someone's got to go to the podium and talk about the joys and travails of being a child of immigrants.  I'm waiting for 50 years from now, when Senator Rrrplginflurx of Planet Zagnut 7 gets up and says, "When my parents crash-landed here, they had nothing but a few food-supplement pills and a dream.  They knew the value of hard work, and that it took a strong family to raise a pouchful of eggs to full maturity.  And they taught me that shedding my skin in public wasn't just illegal, it was shameful."
<hr>
<p>I really, really wish the ADA helpers would leave me alone, too.  They're a corps of volunteers, dressed in blue golf shirts, who roam the convention hall ready to help disabled people if they ask for it.  This I don't mind - what I do mind is getting pounced on every time I look slightly lost (which is a lot of the time even under normal circumstances).  "Can I help you, sir?"  "Just holler if you need assistance, sir."  "If there's anything I can do, sir, please feel free to ask."
<p>Yeah, there's something you can do - you can stop hovering over me like killer bees, that's what.
<p>Any much more of this and I'll start thinking they're really there to quell any Gimp uprisings before they get out of control.  But then, I'm paranoid.
