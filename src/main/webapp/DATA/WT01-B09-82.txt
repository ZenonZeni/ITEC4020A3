<B>Project Title:  High-Efficiency HVAC System for EVs<p>
Performing Organization:  Glacier Bay
</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Kevin Alston (415) 578-0871</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>Glacier Bay, the leading manufacturer of high-performance marine cooling systems, is bringing its innovative design concepts to the electric and hybrid electric vehicle market.  Glacier Bay has developed and is currently marketing an HFC-134a cooling system which has been rated by a marine products independent testing agency as the most energy efficient on the market.</P>

	<P>In this program, Glacier Bay will adapt their patented high-efficiency temperature control systems to electric and hybrid electric vehicles.  The Glacier Bay technology will produce a 50% reduction of energy consumption by the heating and air conditioning system, compared to today's most efficient prototypes; a 50% reduction in the size and weight of the system; increased heat output in cold climates (operating down to -14 °C); and reduced maintenance, as a result of the hermetically sealed design.</P>

	<P>The Glacier Bay system is expected to provide an energy efficiency rating of 11.22 under severe driving conditions, with an average rating of 15 under normal operations.  This compares to a rating of 6.17 for the most efficient prototype available today, as recently tested by the Electric Power Research Institute.  The Glacier Bay system will also be designed to accommodate a range of operating voltages, obviating the need for a separate battery pack for the heating and cooling system.</P>

<P><B>Milestones</B></P>

<P>During the first twelve months of the project, Glacier Bay will design and bench test the prototype system.  By the end of the 18-month project period, Glacier Bay will test the production version in two electric vehicles.
