<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Traditional Views of Mathematics Teaching</H2>

In a typical mathematics class, the teacher begins by checking homework and/or answering questions from the previous class, followed by lecturing on the next topic, then providing examples of typical textbook problems, and concluding by assigning numerous exercises for students to complete for homework.  Generations of students learned mathematics in this manner.  However, the traditional lecture method for teaching mathematics is receiving increasing criticism from a variety of sources.  The lecture method places the student in a passive role as a learner, and according to <i>Everybody Counts:  A Report to the Nation on the Future of Mathematics Education</i>, the National Research Council reports:<BR>
<DL>
<DD>Evidence from many sources shows that the least effective mode for mathematics learning is the one that prevails in most of America's classrooms:  lecturing and listening.  Despite daily homework, for most students and most teachers mathematics continues to be primarily a passive activity:  teachers prescribe; students transcribe.  Students simply do not retain for long what they learn by imitation from lectures, worksheets, or routine homework.  Presentation and repetition help students do well on standardized tests and lower-order skills, but they are generally ineffective as teaching 	strategies for long-term learning, for higher-order thinking, and for versatile problem solving.
</DL>
If this is the case, then the nature of effective mathematics teaching must change.  Today, students need to be prepared for the technological world in which they live.  It is becoming increasingly important to possess skills that include lifelong learning, higher-order thinking, and problem solving skills.  As noted above, this is not being accomplished by traditional educational practices.  This is not to say that the lecture mode of instruction should be completely abandoned, but rather become one of many tools that teachers have available to provide <A HREF="http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/math/ma3tasks.htm">meaningful learning experiences</A> for students.<BR>
