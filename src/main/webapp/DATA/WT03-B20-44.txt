1. Except where another source is directly or indirectly identified, the statistics used in Chapters 1 and 2 are from published Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports or from the data bases used to develop those reports. The primary sources of data are the following EIA reports: Annual Energy Outlook 1995 [DOE/EIA-0383(95)], January 1995; International Energy Annual 1993 [DOE/EIA-0219(93)], May 1995; Annual Energy Review 1994 [DOE/EIA-0384(94)], July 1995; International Energy Outlook 1995 [DOE/EIA-0484(95)], June 1995. EIA is an independent statistical agency within the Department of Energy; other than providing its most recent data, EIA played no role in the formulation of value judgments or development of policies presented in this document.<BR>

2. Different crude oils and petroleum products have different energy (or heat) content. For example, 1 gallon of distillate fuel oil contains almost 11 percent more energy than 1 gallon of motor gasoline, and 1 barrel of imported crude oil contains about 2.7 percent more energy than 1 barrel of domestically produced crude oil. Therefore, computations of petroleum import dependence differ depending on whether the measure is volume or energy content.<BR>

<P>

In terms of volume, the United States imported 8.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products in 1994, and we exported 0.9 million barrels per day. Net petroleum imports were thus 8.0 million barrels per day. Also during 1994, U.S. consumption of gasoline, fuel oil, and other petroleum products totaled 17.7 million barrels per day. Therefore, on the basis of volume, net imports accounted for 45 percent of consumption.<BR>

<P>

In terms of energy content, however, import reliance was more than 49 percent. This is because the 8.0 million barrels per day of net petroleum imports over the year contained 17.1 quadrillion Btu (quads) of energy, and the 17.7 million barrels per day of consumed petroleum products contained 34.7 quads.<BR>

3. Energy-related CO2 emissions published in the Annual Energy Review 1995 are 92 million metric tons higher than those estimated in the Climate Change Action Plan published in October 1993.  Most of this difference is attributed to differences in assessments regarding the impact of the Plan.  EIA prorates the impact of the Plan based on the funding received in fiscal year 1995, which was substantially less than the Administration's request.  Other factors contributing to EIA's projection of higher CO2 emissions include higher economic growth and lower energy price assumptions than those used in 1993.  An update of the Plan is scheduled for the fall of 1995.<BR>

4. For an analysis of gains in energy savings since 1972, see U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Policy, Energy Conservation Trends: Understanding the Factors Affecting Energy Conservation Gains and Their Implications for Policy Development [DOE/PO-0034], April  1995. That study concluded that the U.S. economy used 30.6 quads less in 1991 than if the overall energy intensity of the U.S. economy had remained at its 1972 level. The annual primary energy savings in 1991 were worth approximately $250 billion, and the cumulative energy savings over the 1972-91 period were worth approximately $2.5 trillion (in 1991 dollars).<BR>

5. See, for example, World Energy Council (WEC) Commission, Energy for Tomorrow's World-the Realities, the Real Options and the Agenda for Achievement (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1993), which analyzes four energy cases "believed to cover the broad range of likely outcomes for global energy demand and supply to 2020."<BR>

<P>

6. This framework is described in key Administration policy documents such as Science in the National Interest, Technology for America's Economic Growth, and Technology for a Sustainable Future. <BR>
