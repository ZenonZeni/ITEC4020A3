<p><font size="2">Bombs and the Bill of Rights</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">By Joseph D. McNamara</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Wall Street Journal - May 5, 1995</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Almost 35 years ago I was the first policeman
to reach the scene of a fatal bombing. Someone known as the
Sunday Bomber had placed a powerful explosive under a seat in a
subway car. The bomb went off on a quiet Sunday Morning in New
York City at the West 125th Street station, a block from where I,
a rookie patrolman, stood. I ran to the site and at the bottom of
the subway stairs found a scene from hell. A huge hole had been
torn through the steel subway car and dozens of people stood
dazed and bloody. I approached what appeared to be a bundle of
rags. It was a teenage girl blown almost in half. I leaned over
to hear her feeble plea. 'Help me.' But no one could. She died
before reaching the hospital.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It was nowhere near the scale of the Oklahoma
City tragedy, but I remember the feeling of helplessness and rage
at whoever had planted the bomb and the determination that
something extraordinary had to be done to protect other innocent
victims. Nevertheless, my experience in law enforcement during
the following 35 years leads me to be nauseated and concerned by
the political posturing in Washington following the Oklahoma City
bombing.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The public needs reassuring that the government
will not allow widespread terrorism and that government officials
share the public grief for the innocent victims and their
families. However, the eagerness of the president and
congressional leaders to move in front of TV cameras with hasty
proposals for major increases in federal power rings of
self-aggrandizement and cheapens the nation's sincere moment of
sorrow. The hurried recommendations-to hire more federal agents,
to change intelligence-gathering guidelines. to increase wiretap
surveillance, and to involve military personnel in investigations
or civilians-are hypocritical and potentially harmful.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If our elected leaders truly believe that
increased danger of terrorism warrants such extraordinary powers,
how do they explain that few federal and government facilities
have taken precautions to prevent attacks since the Oklahoma City
bombing?. I have inspected a number of facilities since the
attack. Security personnel have not been on alert, nor has the
government taken the routine precaution of diverting vehicular
traffic to prevent car bombings.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We should also remember that Timothy McVeigh,
charged in the Oklahoma City bombing, was quickly apprehended
without the U.S. passing new laws and spending additional
billions of dollars. It is also important to recall that during
the 20 Years since reasonable guidelines were established for
intelligence gathering by federal agents on citizens, the U.S.
has not been overwhelmed by terrorist acts. The FBI can and does
gather intelligence on domestic groups when appropriate.
Furthermore, despite our horror in viewing the Oklahoma City
blast victims, we should remember that more than 25,000 Americans
are murdered each year and less than 100 of the killings are by
explosives. More important, it is unlikely that any of the
suggested anti-terrorist legislation would have prevented the
Oklahoma City bombing.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">My own experience, which includes heading
police forces of two of the nation's largest cities, is that
law-enforcement intelligence activities are only occasionally
important but require constant oversight. The Militia paranoids
are wrong in believing that law-enforcement officers are
essentially fascist. Yet there have been countless examples
showing that power can be abused by initially well meaning
officers given too much secret discretion. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Recall Richard Nixon's involvement of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and near involvement of the
Central Intelligence Agency in the Watergate coverup. And. much
more recently, there was President Clinton's slip in implying
that radio talk-show hosts critical of his administration were
encouraging potential bombers. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Would a president view criticism as potentially
violent and therefore worthy of secret FBI surveillance under the
new legislation?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It would be most wise to temper our revulsion
for the killers responsible for the Oklahoma City murders and our
sorrow for the victim with the realization that during this
century the greatest terrorists have been governments like Nazi
Germany. Stalin's Soviet Union, Mao's China, and Pol Pot's
Cambodia. They murdered millions and millions of their own
citizens in the name of providing security.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If terrorism increases here, it will be
necessary to take additional precautions to protect the nation
However, the most reliable way to prevent terrorism is by
conducting government in a manner that wins the public's trust
and destroys the appeal of the lunatic fringe. It would be ironic
if anti-terrorist legislation helped destroy the protections of
our Constitution and turned the delusions of the paranoids into
reality.<br>
