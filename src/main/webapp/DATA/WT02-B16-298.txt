<h2>Other Wind Sites</h2>
</center>


<p><a href="http://www.igc.apc.org/awea">The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA)</a> - works to further the 
development of wind energy as a reliable energy alternative.  Its site 
offers an extensive publications catalog, a FAQ, and articles from Wind 
Energy Weekly newsletter


<p><a href="http://www.enterprise.net/manxwind/bwea.htm">The British Wind Energy Association (BWEA)</a> - represents wind in the 
United Kingdom.  BWEA’s page is under construction, but offers an 
e-mail link to the Association, and detailed information on the UK’s Non 
Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) program, under which the government 
provides subsidies for a limited number of renewable energy projects.


<p><a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/energy/earthtext/windintro.html">The California Energy Commission</a> - Offers a brief overview of wind in 
California, still the world’s leader in installed wind energy capacity.


<p><a href="http://keynes.fb12.tu-berlin.de/luftraum/konst/canwea.html">The Canadian Wind Energy Association</a> - Membership information, news 
items, and other wind links.


<p><a href="http://193.133.97.7/re/">Centre for the Analysis and Dissemination of Demonstrated Energy 
(CADDET)</a> - Contains some general wind information and a few tantalizing 
bits of information about wind applications.


<p><a href="http://nwtc.nrel.gov">National Wind Technology Center (NWTC)</a> - The first-class 
research, development and test facilities available at the NWTC make the Center a complete indoor
and outdoor laboratory for wind turbines and individual components.

<p><a href="http://risul1.risoe.dk/amv/">Risoe National Laboratory</a> - The Meteorology and Wind Energy 
Department at Denmark’s national laboratory


<p><a href="http://www.sandia.gov/Renewable_Energy/wind_energy/homepage.html">Sandia National Laboratory’s Wind Energy Technology program</a>, part of 
the U.S. Department of Energy’s wind program, seeks to develop knowledge 
and tools to address critical technical questions affecting the 
commercialization of wind.
