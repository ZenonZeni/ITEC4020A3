In 1994, the General Clinical Research Service (PI 5) continued to devote 12 to 15 of its beds to research and treatment of patients with severe personality disorders. The remainder of the beds were reserved for depressed and/or suicidal adults and teenagers who participated in studies sponsored by the Departments of Biological Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Child Psychiatry. During the year, Drs. Craig Tomlinson and Adele Tutter did senior resident electives on the Service.

The Unit for Personality Studies (UPS) research protocol, which utilized standardized instruments for the assessment of DSM-III-R personality disorders, continued in data-analytic and report-writing phases. Combining data collected on PI 5 patients with data on patients from the Psychoanalytic Center and the Depression Evaluation Service (DES), the Unit for Personality Studies published reports on the validity of self-report scales for personality disorders, the validity of self-defeating personality disorders and serotonergic sensitivity in borderline personality disorder. A paper on Axis I/Axis II comorbidity was accepted for publication. Papers on the relationship of anxiety disorders to personality disorders and on the specificity of dependent personality disorder for depression were submitted for publication. These studies continued under the direction of Andrew Skodol, M.D. with the participation of Drs. John Oldham, Steven Hyler, Lyle Rosnick, David Kellman, Ron Goldman, Jane Waters, Norman Doidge, Patrick McGrath, Peggy Gallaher, Susan Vaughan, Eric Hollander, and Dan Stein.

This past year PI 5 continued to serve as the site of an investigation of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a treatment for major depression. This project, sponsored by the Department of Biological Psychiatry, is headed by Dr. Harold Sackeim, Principal Investigator, with Joan Prudic, M.D., and D.P. Devanand, M.D., as Co-Principal Investigators, assisted <BR>
by M. Nobler, M.D. and Barbara Erwin-Mcguire, Ph.D. until August 1994, and Shoshana Peyser, M.S.W. thereafter. In 1994, twelve patients were admitted to PI 5 for this protocol. This work was given a MERIT Award from NIMH with funding through 1995 and an extension to 2000. The findings  from the second ECT study, completed in 1990, have been extensively published, with 81 articles in print or press, and eight more in review. Several data sets are in preparation for further publications. In addition, ten patients admitted to PI 5 also participated in a second multi-center study on continuation pharmacotherapy following ECT, now in its third year.

The Division of Neurochemistry continued a large study of various forms of self-injuring behaviors. Over a period of three years, 180 individuals with depression, suicidal behavior, other self-injuring behavior and compulsive hair-pulling (trichotillomania) will be studied in a battery of neuropharmacological and psychological assessments. This research project, led by Dr. Barbara Stanley, is a continuation of previous research that has been carried out by the Division of Neurochemistry over the last seven years and will focus on dysregulation of the serotonin neurotransmitter system in people at high risk for various self-directed, damaging behaviors, particularly suicide. Clinical applications of the results of the study will include developing strategies to reduce the risk of dangerous suicidal behavior among people at high risk for such behavior. In addition, this study will obtain genetic material from 500 individuals, providing a database for the study of possible genetic markers of these conditions. Data from this study will also provide an opportunity to examine biological correlates of severe character pathology. In addition to the scientific and medical value of these investigations, the applied goal of this kind of research should lead to strategies which may enable doctors to reduce the risk of dangerous behaviors, allowing patients to avoid hospitalizations and continue safely in outpatient treatment.
