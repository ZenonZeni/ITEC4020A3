<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Wankel Engine</FONT> {wang'-kul}

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT>he Wankel engine is an advanced type of
internal-combustion engine developed in 1956 by <A HREF =
"dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A>, a German mathematician [engineer -
<FONT SIZE=-1>AM</FONT>].

<P> The <A HREF = "rce.html">Wankel engine</A> differs greatly from
conventional engines.  It retains the familiar intake, compression,
power, and exhaust cycle but uses, instead of a piston, cylinder, and
mechanical valves, a triangular rotor that revolves around the eccentric
[shaft].  The three apexes, or tips, of this rotor remain in constant,
snug contact with the combustion-chamber walls.  The only other moving
part is the crankshaft.  The Wankel engine has 40 percent fewer parts
and roughly one-third the bulk and weight of a comparable reciprocating
engine.

<P> In addition to the simplicity of design, there is little or no
vibration in the Wankel.  There are no problems with heat dissipation,
hot spots, or detonation, all of which are considerations in the
conventional reciprocating engine.  Wankel engines, most of which are
liquid-cooled, are capable of running at unusually high speeds for long
periods of time.  The motor exhibits a high power-to-weight ratio and an
exceptionally good torque curve at all engine speeds.

<P> Within the Wankel, three chambers are formed by the sides of the
rotor and the wall of the housing.  The shape, size, and position of
these chambers are constantly altered by the rotor's clockwise rotation
and the faster rotation of the eccentric [shaft].  The usual four-stroke
cycle occurs with the simple valving and power-stroke frequency of the
two-stroke engine.  The rotor opens the intake port and the fuel and air
enter as in the conventional engine.  The rotor continues, closing the
intake port by passing beyond it; then compression begins, followed by
ignition, combustion, and expansion for the power stroke until the apex
seal at the tip of the triangle opens the exhaust port.  The exhaust
cycle then takes place, again with no speed-restricting valve mechanism.
The engine is unique in that the power impulse is spread over
approximately 270 degrees of crankshaft rotation, as compared to 180
degrees for the conventional reciprocating two-stroke engine.  Although
it is still an experimental engine for most manufacturers, the Japanese
auto maker <A HREF = "mazda.html">Mazda</A> has used the Wankel to power
some of its <A HREF = "rx-7.html">sports models</A>.  The major problems
with Wankels -- or rotary engines, as they are often called -- has been
their low fuel efficiency and the difficulty of designing engines of
larger than two-rotor capacity.  In the late 1980s, however, a
three-rotor engine was introduced [to production].

There is a reference to <A
HREF="http://triton.mathematik.tu-muenchen.de/~kaplan/fakul/node28.html">Othmar
Baier</A>, a Professor of Geometry at Technische Universit&auml;t
M&uuml;nchen, 1960-71 who worked with NSU and Wankel on eine
Rotationskolbenmaschine.  Wankel had arrived at the peripheral housing
shape by practical means.  In 1954 Baier identified the mathematical
classification of the shape as epitrochoidal [<A HREF =
"glossary.html#epitrochoid">gloss</A>].  He wrote VDI report No. 45 in
1960 which gives some mathematical treatment of the RCE.  He assisted
the preparation of the Wankel's 1964 classification of rotary machines.
