EUROPEAN APPROVAL TIMES LEAVE US LAGGING BEHIND

BRUSSELS - A study on European approval times for medical technology
has revealed that patients in the US wait up to three times as long as
their European counterparts for government approval of new medical
devices.

The study, conducted by Medical Technology Consultants Europe Ltd
(MTCE, Brussels), found that higher-risk, breakthrough medical devices
were approved in European Union (EU) within 80-120 days, provided the
manufacturer passed a European Union facility inspection (which is
completed within 120 days).  The study also found that new lower-risk
devices entered the European market with no delay once a manufacturer
passed the initial facility inspection.  Similar devices take an
average of 178 days to be approved in the US.

One reason for the speedier approvals, noted the study, is the number
of authorised bodies that can carry out the approval procedure.  "The
approval procedures are carried out by a number of authorised
certifying bodies spread throughout Europe, rather than the one
authority in the US [the Food and Drug Administration]." MTCE said that
there are 35 third-party organisations, known as authorised bodies to
carry out the approval procedures for medical devices throughout the
EU.

Point of contention

This is a particular point of contention, with the US Food and Drug
Administration.  In testimony before the US Congress, FDA commissioner
David Kessler recently criticised key provisions in FDA reform
legislation allowing third parties to take part in the review process.
However, US device manufacturers are citing the European study's
findings as additional proof that FDA reform is essential.

Maurice Freeman, MTCE's principal and a former European Commission
medical device official, said, in a statement prepared for the US
Senate Committee on Labour and Human Resources (which has jurisdiction
on FDA reform legislation), "Many patients who benefit from the
applications of such new devices in Europe would have [under US
approval times] either not received the benefits from the use of such
devices or in many cases would have died."

The FDA takes four times as long to approve breakthrough medical
devices than is allowed by US statute, according to the Health Industry
Manufacturers Association (HIMA - the US trade group for medical device
and diagnostic manufacturers).  HIMA says the approval times for these
devices have nearly doubled since 1990 and; the FDA's record on
approving incremental improvements to existing devices is similar, with
approval times also nearly doubling since 1990.

"Manufacturers simply aren't as eager to research and develop devices
in the US knowing that they'll face these egregious delays," said HIMA
president Alan Magazine.  "It's a double whammy - the patients wait for
devices stuck in the FDA's pipeline, and manufacturers have little
incentive to bring new devices into that pipeline in the first place."

The difference between the US and EU review process for medical devices
is not a matter of safety, Mr Freeman said.  "The European route is
extremely rigid in its requirement for the manufacturer to provide
suitable evidence as to the development process, to verify the design
by comprehensive review process and to manufacture under controlled
conditions," he added.  The current EU review process for breakthrough
medical devices was implemented in 1992.

Both the American and European systems contain sound elements that are
essential in protecting public health, notes HIMA.  "We are aware of no
study that shows that medical devices on the market in Europe are less
safe than those in the US," Mr Magazine said.

According to another recent study conducted by The Wilkerson Group, a
New York-based independent consulting firm, FDA delays in approving
devices will lead to the loss of US jobs to nations where approval
processes are more streamlined - an estimated 50,000 over the next five
years.  Governments in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and elsewhere
have already begun to highlight the impediment of FDA regulatory delay
in their marketing materials to attract US businesses overseas.

IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC DIRECTIVE CLEARS EP FIRST READING

STRASBOURG - European Union (EU) proposals to extend legislation on the
sale and use of medical devices to in vitro diagnostic equipment
cleared its first reading in the European Parliament on 12 March.
However, the assembly's endorsement was heavily qualified by 50
amendments, many of which were accepted by Industry Commissioner Martin
Bangemann.

Among the key issues that emerged were compulsory use of "local"
language - resisted by industry - and whether the EU should operate a
central data bank to aid monitoring.  Ethical aspects of devices using
human substances were another area of concern, with several speakers
calling for these to be dealt with under separate procedures.

Commissioner Bangemann said he was prepared to take on board 47 of the
78 amendments originally tabled, although a dozen involved linguistic
problems and were not put to the vote.  Among the accepted amendments
were those concerned with safety, protection and quality.  There were
accepted provisions concerning incidence reporting and use of a data
base for medical devices on the market.  One change placed the
Commission in the reporting loop with member states and may mean a
possible role in decisions to withdraw problematic devices.
Commissioner Bangemann also accepted an amendment making it clear that
the Directive would not affect "national laws which provide for the
supply of diagnostic medical devices and products by a medical
prescription".

Accepted amendments also clarified definitions and made wording
changes, such as "clinical laboratories" being called "medical analysis
laboratories".  In those provisions that pertained to human tissues and
substances produced from such tissue, the word "cells" was added.
Additionally, "packaging" was added to items that discussed standards
of design and manufacture.

Much of the debate centred on those amendments that the Commissioner
was not prepared to accept.  Chief among these were language and
labelling concerns.

Labelling could involve major costs

On use of languages, Commissioner Bangemann accepted it would normally
be self-evident that the language of the country of intended sale
should be used.  "However, in this specific case, this is not so
logical because 95 per cent of these products are for use by experts,
people who as a general rule are familiar with two or three languages
used in medicine.  It's not just a matter of labelling but also
handbooks and software, which are becoming increasingly important in
the use of these devices.  Therefore, it would involve major costs,
particularly in the case of smaller member states," he said.

Producers in smaller states, seeking to release their products on the
single market would be forced to have information translated into the
11 principal languages used in the 15 EU member states.  Commissioner
Bangemann insisted that the proposals would not preclude member states
from introducing a rule to that effect for its own producers.  However,
the Commission was prepared to re-examine the idea if it attracted
support in the Council of Ministers.  The original text of Article 4(3)
provides that member states may require information to be provided "in
their national language(s) or in other Community language(s) to the
extent that it is needed for safe and correct use of the device".

He also rejected Scottish Nationalist member Mrs Winnie Ewing's
(successful) Amendment 71, which would add "reagents and reagent
products of biological origin for the diagnosis of genetic diseases,
the detection and dosage of tumorous markers and the dosage of
hormones" to the Directive's annex listing of reagents and reagent
products for which conformity assessment procedures would be required.

In the Commission draft, this listing is limited to blood grouping and
detection of markers of HIV infection, Hepatitis B and C.  The
Commissioner also said he would be prepared to revisit this question.

As drafted, the Directives will cover reagents, instruments and
equipment for examining tissues or substances from the human body for
medical purposes and would include kits for conducting pregnancy or
cholesterol tests.  Currently subject to national rules, these devices
will have to comply with EU safety requirements before being marketed.

Time schedules complicated

The time schedules involved are complicated: the Directive will become
law 20 days after publication of the final, definitive text.  But
member states will have to allow continued marketing of devices
complying with current, national rules for a period of four years after
that act of final adoption.  Meanwhile, member states will then have to
transpose the Directive's requirements into national law by April 1998.

The proposals now go to the Council of Ministers, so that the 15 EU
member state governments can agree their own "common position" on the
proposals from the European Commission.

Rapporteur for the assembly's committee on industrial policy, French
parliamentarian Alain Pompidou, himself a professor of medicine, noted
that the legislation was a follow-up to two medical device directives
dating from 1990 and 1993.

Like several other speakers, Prof Pompidou was uneasy about the "hands-
off" approach followed by the Commission.

Procedures leaving quality control as a matter for manufacturers might
be justified for instruments using stable materials and electronic
circuits.  Prof Pompidou said the use of diagnostic medical devices
involved two major problems: stability of biological reagents, in the
case of 35 per cent of devices using immunological or other type
reagents, and the "potentially dramatic and tragic consequences of
diagnostic errors".

Arguing the case for EU monitoring and a requirement for defective
equipment to be recalled, Prof Pompidou said procedures had to be put
in place to identify and react to problems.  He described amendments
covering use of local language as "superfluous as far as health
professionals were concerned, but vitally important for self-testing
kits".

While Commissioner Bangemann was not prepared to go along with calls
for a full-blown, centralised EU monitoring system, he indicated that
the Commission might be prepared to adopt some points from milder
amendments.

Pending creation of a central EU database to which national authorities
would have access, transitional arrangements might entail manufacturers
being required to make notifications not just to the authorities of
their "home" state, but also to those of each member state targeted for
sales.

He also accepted that states should be under a duty to monitor
continuously devices and "take all necessary steps to ensure that
devices may be placed on the market and put into service only if they
comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive when properly
supplied, installed, maintained and used in accordance with their
intended purpose".

GRACE MERGES NMC WITH FRESENIUS REJECTING BAXTER'S $3.8 MILLION BID

DEERFIELD, IL - Baxter International has withdrawn its $3.8 billion bid
for Waltham, Massachusetts-based National Medical Care (NMC), WR Grace
and Co's dialysis services unit.  Baxter's bid for the business was
recently rejected by Grace, which favours the merger of NMC with the
dialysis products business of Fresenius AG (Germany), though the door
through which Baxter could have waved an increased bid was never firmly
closed.

Under the agreement, NMC will make a $2.3 billion payment to Grace
(Boca Raton, Florida), whose shareholders will get a 44.8 per cent
holding in the company, Fresenius Medical Care.  Fresenius USA, the
German group's US business (which manufactures and distributes products
for treating renal failure), will become a subsidiary of Fresenius
Medical Care, with the new company based in Germany and operating its
US business out of Waltham.  NMC, which operates 549 outpatient kidney
dialysis treatment clinics in the US and 75 abroad, plans to borrow
$2.3 billion for the transaction.

The deal should be complete by the third quarter of 1996, and will
result in the formation of possibly the largest integrated kidney
dialysis company achieving 1996 sales estimated at around $3.5 billion.
 The agreement will net Grace an equity gain of $700 million, a
significant portion of which it hopes to use to purchase as much as 20
per cent of its common stock.  Fresenius Medical Care is expected to be
traded publicly on the New York and European stock exchanges.

The withdrawal of Baxter's offer ends analyst speculation about whether
the company would raise its bid, especially considering the formidable
competitive strength of a Fresenius-NMC merger.  Baxter, however,
believes the impact on its own renal business will be limited.  Even
so, Baxter remains confused by Grace's flat rejection of what it
considered a "fair" offer and was reluctant to sit and negotiate
further.

Baxter had been in discussions with Grace since December 1995, and
stands by its bid to buy out NMC (the $3.8 billion deal would have
involved a straight $2 billion payment to Grace and a $1.8 billion in
Baxter common stock).

Early in February Baxter made its offer public, a move widely agreed to
represent a forceful invitation to push Grace into formal negotiations.

Baxter's chief executive, Vernon Louks, described the bid in a letter
to Grace counterpart, Albert Costello, as "substantially more
favourable to the Grace shareholders than the Fresenius proposal." He
added: "We will not increase our offer...since Grace management
continues to refuse to discuss our proposal and has determined to go
forward with the Fresenius transaction, we hereby withdraw our
proposal."

Last year, Baxter, with annual sales of $10 billion overall, including
$1.3 billion from its kidney therapy products, announced its intention
to split the company by spinning off its hospital supply division.  The
"new Baxter", essentially its medical specialities operations (with
annual sales of about $5 billion), includes its renal business.  If the
acquisition of NMC had gone Baxter's way, it was expected to have
diluted earnings by less than 5 per cent in the first year, and started
to add to earnings after about 18 months.

WR Grace, with interests lying foremost in specialty chemicals,
originally proposed to spin-off the NMC business to stockholders late
last year, after rejecting a $3.5 billion takeover bid for NMC by the
unit's chairman, Constantine Hampers (who will stay with the company if
the merger goes ahead).  Plans were delayed, however, by US federal
investigations into NMC's billing practices.

Fresenius will assume NMC's legal obligations

As part of the merger deal, Fresenius will assume all of NMC's legal
obligations from on-going government investigations.  The company is
the subject of three federal investigations.  Most recently, The New
York Times reported, the company received a letter from the US
Attorney's office in New Jersey stating that NMC was the target of a
New Jersey grand jury investigation.

Meanwhile, a separate inquiry into contracts between NMC's dialysis
subsidiaries and physician supply and service companies is underway by
a grand jury in Virginia.  Moreover, a US attorney in Massachusetts has
issued five subpoenas for NMC records in connection with an
investigation into a number of management, employee and accounting
practices.

NMC's three divisions achieved sales of $2.1 billion overall last year;
divided between its dialysis services division, providing outpatient
and inpatient hospital dialysis services ($1.5 billion), its homecare
division, offering home treatment services ($327 million), and its
medical products group, which manufactures dialysis products ($300
million).  The world market for dialysis products is estimated to be
$3.1 billion, with the major players being Baxter (holding 42 per cent
of the market), Fresenius AG (13 per cent), and Gambro AG (32 per
cent).

Meanwhile, Baxter recently opened its second medical products factory,
Eurovac Ltd, in Malta to manufacture CRD flex suction canisters.  The
company expects the plant to export 3.7 million units, valued at $3.4
million.  during its first year of operation, primarily to Germany and
Italy.

SMITH & NEPHEW PROFITS UP IN 1995

LONDON - Healthcare group Smith & Nephew Plc (S&N) announced pre-tax
profit before exceptional items up by 5 per cent to #180.4 million
($275.7 million) for the year to 31 December 1995.  Exceptional charges
of #14.6 million stemming from the integration of acquisitions were
largely offset by #11 million in gains from disposals.Turnover
increased from #965 million to #1.02 billion despite much tougher
market conditions, including pressures on healthcare budgets worldwide.

Chairman Eric Kinder said: "We do not expect any easing of the
difficult market conditions in North America, but further improvement
in Europe is likely together with continued progress in the Far East."

Turnover rose from #173.1 million to #186.1 million in Africa, Asia and
Australia.  With a rapid increase in sales for the second half of the
year, Asia and Japan experienced particularly strong growth at 30 per
cent and 25 per cent respectively.  Sales in the UK grew by 12 per cent
to #175 million, attributable to the establishment of a single sales
force for healthcare products which generated substantial orders from
the National Health Service, combined with a strong performance from
the consumer healthcare sector.  In Continental Europe, sales expanded
by 8 per cent to #230.3 million; the markets in France and Spain had
recovered in the second half of the year, while S&N was beginning to
build a stronger position in Germany.

In North America the expansion of managed care combined with the
consolidation of hospital groups and the increase in co-operative
buying organisations meant that S&N had to deal with a smaller number
of professional buying groups.  Sales slowed in the second half, but
still rose by 5 per cent to #404.7 million for the year.

Strong product lines during the year included chronic wound dressing
Allevyn, wound cleanser IntraSite Gel and IV3000, an intravenous
catheter dressing.  Rehabilitation products, extended by the
acquisition of Homecraft for #29 million during the year, also
performed impressively.  The slowdown in the US market had retarded the
growth of trauma, endoscopy and orthopaedic implants, although they
continued to do well in other markets, achieving sales growth of
between 4 and 6 per cent.

On the whole, selling prices were expected to remain "at best static",
but Mr Kinder believed the strengths in S&N's marketing and research-
backed innovation "will enable us to drive forward the competitiveness
of our product range to achieve steady growth and to outperform global
healthcare markets".

ESAOTE SEES INCREASED SALES, HOPES TO GO PUBLIC

GENOA - Spurred by exports, the Italian company Esaote reported
increasing sales of electro-medical devices in 1995 with plans to be
quoted on the stock market later this year.

The Genoa-based firm put its 1995 sales at L258 billion ($1.6 million),
up 11 per cent from the previous year, with its net income rising from
L4.8 to L8 billion.  Esaote will hold an extraordinary meeting of its
shareholders to decide its entry into the stock markets, possibly in
July 1996.

The company, characterising internal demand as "stalled", said its
overseas business now accounts for 53 per cent of sales, doubled from
two years ago.  In addition, the position of its overseas affiliates -
the US Biosound, Esaote France and Esaote Deutschland - are also
reported to have improved.

"The salient point of our growth", says Carlo Castellano, president and
chief executive officer of Esaote, "is our increasing global role in
the strategic sectors such as ultrasonic devices, tomography and
dedicated magnetic resonance."

Once a government-owned company and privatised in the recent flurry of
divestments by the state, 15 per cent of Esaote's shares were bought by
the Italian pharmaceutical group Bracco last year for L18 billion.
Bracco together with other major shareholders, such as Advent
International, Electra Investment Trust, Ipef-Euroventures Italia, Arca
Merchant and Sofipa, control 71.8 per cent of the company's shares.
The remainder belongs to Esaote's managers.

PRIVATISATION ON AGENDA FOR ORTOPEDICHE RIZZOLI

BOLOGNA - Officine Ortopediche Rizzoli, one of Italy's prominent
producers of artificial limbs, is considering privatisation to break
out of its current slump and is thinking about changing its focus to
high-technology products.

Ortopediche Rizzoli, which began producing wooden limbs in Bologna 100
years ago, is still a prestigious name in the production and sales of
orthopaedic artificial limbs.  In addition, the company produces
surgical equipment, wheel-chairs and other rehabilitation products
(some of it by handmade methods).

Its privatisation - the company is 94 per cent publicly-owned including
partial ownership by the city of Bologna - is expected this year.
Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara, a local entrepreneur who owns the Bologna
football team, has offered Ortopediche Rizzoli some L11 billion ($6.8
million), according to La Repubblica (the Italian national daily).  Mr
Frascara told La Repubblica he believes he could double the company's
sales.

Last year, the company's sales remained constant at L43 billion and it
broke even, although a net loss of about L1 billion is predicted for
1996.  Sales of orthopaedic devices account for 85 per cent of its
business, with 70 per cent of its total production going to Italian
hospitals and 30 per cent to private institutions and citizens.

In one high-tech venture, the company shot to fame at home and abroad
through its pioneering work in mioelectric hands capable of interacting
and amplifying cerebral impulses through receivers.  It also introduced
"intelligent" prosthesis to Italy.  One of its products is the "Bologna
Boot", which assists persons with spinal defects to walk with ease.

INCENTIVE SECURES OWNERSHIP POSITION IN GAMBRO

STOCKHOLM - Incentive Ab has consolidated its ownership position in
Gambro, the Swedish manufacturer and supplier of dialysis systems,
acquiring the outstanding 25 per cent of shares in the company from
pension funds, financial institutions and private owners in Sweden.

Incentive shareholders accepted the offer to such an extent that it
held 99.4 per cent of the capital and 99.7 per cent of votes.

Incentive's push to streamline its hold on Gambro came less than eight
weeks after the company presented a bid worth SKr10.3 billion ($1.4
billion) for the outstanding shares in Gambro.  Incentive's pre-bid
status was already strong, with the investment company holding 42 per
cent of shares and 58 per cent of votes.

A significant factor in the success of the bid was the acceptance of
the Crafoord Foundation, which was the second biggest owner in Gambro
after Incentive, with 2.2 per cent of shares and 11.3 per cent of
votes.

Gambro was founded by Holger Crafoord in 1964, and was initially
focused on the development of kidney dialysis machines and after care
products, areas in which the company still holds a strong market
position worldwide.

The bid emerged as Gambro issued an updated profit forecast for FY1995,
projecting earnings of SKr1.5 billion for the year, that was below what
some analysts had been anticipating.

Incentive's action in bidding for Gambro signals a change in the
company's strategy, which has been focused on acquiring minority and
strategic holdings in many of Sweden's leading industrials.  The
company's portfolio includes large shareholdings in Ericsson, Asea
Sweden and Electrolux.

Incentive is now expected to divest these shares as part of a new
policy of developing into a healthcare and energy systems group.
Resultingly, analysts forecast the company will divest non-core
interests in 1996.

"Once the Gambro acquisition is complete, more than half of the
Incentive group's annual sales will be generated from activities linked
to medical and diagnostic systems.  We intend to invest more heavily
into this business segment and sell-off non-core activities in the
future," said Incentive's chief executive officer Mikael Lilius.

The takeover is expected to boost Incentive's profit per share by about
SKr7 to SKr10 in the short-term.  "The long-term picture is more rosy,
and we expect a goodwill gain from the takeover of SKr8 billion and
increased profitability," said Lilius.

GEHE CONSIDERS TAKEOVER BID FOR HAFSLUND-NYCOMED

BONN/OSLO - Gehe, the German medical technology systems group, is
reported to be considering a hostile takeover bid on Hafslund-Nycomed,
Norway's leading supplier of healthcare products and hospital
equipment.  Gehe, which had revenues of $10.4 billion in 1995, is
stated to be particularly interested in acquiring the Norwegian
company's highly-profitable and international X-ray contrast fluids
division.

Hafslund-Nycomed will, under a plan approved by its board at the end of
1995, be split into two companies - medical products and power
production/distribution - both of which are to be listed on the Oslo
Stock Exchange in 1996.  Hafslund is also examining a possible listing
in Stockholm.

Gehe is in an acquisitive mood at present.  The company recently
presented a #5/share offer to acquire UK pharmaceuticals company Lloyds
Chemists, which has a market value of #6 billion ($9.5 billion).

The Norwegian group has been looking for an international partner since
1994.  Its search was nearly realised in 1995, when Hafslund signed a
letter of intent to merge with the US company Ivax.  This deal fell
through when Hafslund's Norwegian shareholders held out for a higher
price which Ivax refused to pay.  Although the merger was abandoned,
both companies agreed to enter into a long-term co-operation deal.

LEIRAS SET TO BE SOLD

HELSINKI - Leiras Oy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Huhtamaki group
and Finland's second biggest manufacturer of medical products, has
denied any connection between its intended sale and recent negative
publicity surrounding controversial tests carried out for the company's
contraceptive implant, Norplant, in Africa.

Huhtamaki is holding talks with at least four potential buyers,
including Astra, Ciba Geigy, Upjohn-Pharmacia and Bayer.  Orion,
Finland's largest pharmaceuticals manufacturer, is reported to be
looking for an international partner ahead of tendering a bid for
Leiras.

Huhtamaki's chief executive officer Timo Peltola said the group's
decision to divest Leiras was based on the need to restructure and
concentrate its future business around a single core division, foods
production and marketing.

"Our conclusion has nothing to do with the recent publicity involving
Norplant.  The simple truth is that Leiras is not large enough to
support the heavy investments in research and development (R&D) it
needs to make in future years" said Mr Peltola.  Leiras specialises in
developing and producing bone metabolism and ophthalmics as well as
oral contraceptive pills and implant devices.

The negative publicity that surrounded Leiras emerged following a
British television programme's (BBC's Panorama) investigation into
trial tests of Norplant within the framework of a tribal village in
west Africa.  The programme, which focused on the alleged unsystematic
nature and side-affects emanating from the tests, quoted international
researchers from the US and elsewhere who questioned the product's
reliability and innocuousness.

The negative publicity affected the value of Huhtamaki's shares and
caused much discussion within senior company circles, despite a company
declaration that associated tests in Africa had been conducted under
contract with a research firm outside the group.

"The rising trend in R&D expenditure, coupled with the downward
pressure on drug pricing due to cost savings programmes launched by
healthcare providers, is forcing the industry to seek greater economies
of scale from larger unit sizes.  The wave of mergers which has
affected the top 40 companies globally is now making itself felt among
smaller firms too," said Mr Peltola.

Describing Leiras's profit and R&D track-records as "excellent", Mr
Peltola said that the cost benefits to the company of remaining
independent were rapidly disappearing.  The company's R&D outlay
amounted to 20 per cent of net revenues in 1995, while the company
would find it increasingly difficult to find sufficient resources to
market its products internationally.

"We feel that Leiras's potential will be best realised as a specialised
unit within a major international pharmaceutical company.  The
divestment has attracted a lot of attention, and we expect to close the
sale during the spring," said Mr Peltola.

Leiras reported operating earnings of $32 million on revenues of just
over $204 million in 1995, in a year when the firm accounted for 11 per
cent of Huhtamaki group's total sales volume.  Some 51 per cent of
Leiras's production was exported.  The company operates three
production plants in Finland, with sales subsidiaries located in
Singapore, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

SPECTRAL DIAGNOSTIC DISAPPOINTED WITH US SALES EFFORTS

VANCOUVER - Everyone says that Spectral Diagnostics Inc of Toronto (SDI
on the Toronto Stock Exchange) has a good product.  It's a credit-card-
sized diagnostic kit that can determine in seconds from a blood sample
whether an emergency room patient has, or has not had, a heart attack.
Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in March l995, Spectral
expected hot sales of the product to hospitals and emergency care
centres across North America.

It chose Dade International of Deerfield, Illinois (a Baxter
subsidiary) as its US marketing partner.  However, sales revenue since
product launch a year ago has been disappointing: C$400,000 ($289,855)
in April-September l995, and only $70,000 in the last quarter of the
year.  Share price, which had boomed up to C$40 on news of the FDA
approval, has slumped, and is bumping along this year in the C$10-12
range.

Spectral appears to be less than satisfied with its US partner's
efforts.  It recently reorganised its arrangement with Dade, allowing
it to find additional marketing partners, or even replace Dade
entirely.

Chris Plaxton, Spectral executive vice-president said: "We wanted to
see sales increase at a faster pace than we thought we were going to
see them increase with just the Dade International sales force.  Also,
Spectral is prepping a new diagnostic product for the marketplace.  A
successor to the CK-myoglobin test kit now on the market, this would be
a four-component test, refining the diagnosis by adding two more
cardiac markers."

So far, however, Spectral has not announced any new marketing
arrangements, nor has the filing process for the new test yet been
completed.

I-TA SWINDLES INVESTORS

TAIPEI - The financial slump that has hit Taiwan's businesses hard
recently claimed a local medical instrument company as one of its
latest victims.  However, instead of down-sizing operations and
applying to the banks for loans, the company's operators "swindled"
their investors.

Chen Hsi-i and Hsueh Kuan-tsu, I-Ta medical instrument company's
general manager and owner, have been charged with fraud by Wu Yin-chih,
as well as two men surnamed Hung and Kuo.

Chen and Hsueh apparently approached the three investors with a
business proposal to expand the company's operations into mainland
China.  Chen and Hueh reportedly then deceived the investors into
thinking the I-Ta company was stable and had plenty of finances.

The pair wrote cheques to guarantee a NT$2 million ($7million) loan to
Hung, and asked Kuo for NT$1.2 million as a bidding deposit.  They
asked Wu to give them NT$1.5 million to finance the project and
promised that the money would soon be repaid.

After giving the pair a total of almost NT$5 million, Wu, Hung and Kuo
realised their money had gone to saving the financially crippled I-Ta.
They filed charges with the Taipei District Prosecutors Office on 29
February.

Chen and Hsueh have denied any wrongdoing.

Sales were up 19.7 per cent to NZ$16.08 million in the first six
months.  The directors of publicly-listed Ebos expect profit momentum
to be maintained in the full year to June 1996.

Full-year results will receive a one-off boost after tax of some
NZ$600,000 following the sale last year to Johnson and Johnson of
Ebos's orthopaedics marketing business in Australia.  Ebos will hand
over management of this business in August this year.

FAULDING SEES MIXED RESULTS

SYDNEY - Australia's Faulding has reported mixed results for its
devices business in the six months to 31 December 1995, with better
than expected profits at Faulding Imaging and a loss at Selby
Scientific.  Primarily a drug distributor, Faulding, the largest
Australian pharmaceuticals company with first-half revenues of A$781
million ($582 million) up 13.8 per cent, also is a distributor of
devices.

Faulding Imaging's main activity is distribution in Australia of the
medical equipment and microscope lines of Olympus Optical of Japan.
Selby supplies scientific equipment and laboratory consumables in
Australia and New Zealand.

Sales figures for individual subsidiaries are not released, but the
company says sales at Faulding Imaging were marginally below those for
the previous corresponding period.  Profit contribution, on the other
hand, was ahead both of the 1994/95 first half result and budget.

At Selby Scientific sales matched the result for the same period in
1994/95, but the division recorded an after-tax operating loss of NZ$1
million ($645,161), which comes on top of an A$1.9 million loss in the
1994/95 year.  Faulding hopes for improved profitability following a
recent restructuring of the group.

FIRST HIV ANTIGEN TEST APPROVED

ROCKVILLE, MD - On 14 March the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the first antigen test kit to screen blood donors for HIV-1.
The new kit was also approved for use in diagnosing HIV-1 infections
and monitoring the progress of the disease itself.

The screening kit, manufactured by the Coulter Corp of Florida, is
known as the Coulter HIV-1 p24 Antigen Assay.  Based on an 8 August
1995 FDA recommendation to all registered blood and plasma
establishments, the test can be used within 90 days of the approval.

The Coulter test uses antigens (the virus' own proteins) which can
detect the virus about a week earlier than the antibody tests used
currently.  By reducing the "window period", when donors may be HIV-
infected but still have negative antibody tests, it has been estimated
that HIV-1 antigen screening could prevent around 25 per cent of the
current cases of Aids transmitted by transfusion.

Although the FDA has recommended that the test be used to screen blood
donations, it does not recommend that it replace the HIV antibody test
for routine patient testing and counselling in a medical setting.

The kit will be marketed to blood establishments by Ortho Diagnostics
Systems Inc, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (New Jersey).  There are
about 14 million blood donations processed annually in the US.

NEW DEVICE CAN WRITE WITH EYES

PARIS - Scientists at the National Health and Medical Research
Institute in Lille, France have developed a device that will assist
quadriplegics who cannot communicate.  The device allows them to write
with their eyes.

As the patient looks at a special keyboard, a laser-guided camera
records the stare as the patient's eye moves from letter to letter.
The camera feeds the selected letters into a computer, and the text
appears instantaneously on a computer screen.

The device, which is the result of five years of research, was
displayed at a recent Paris exhibition on language-learning techniques.
 Within a year, researchers expect that the device, called Deltavision,
will be fine-tuned and ready to market.

Delta 7, a humanitarian group that represents the interests of
paralysed people, organised funding for the project.

The Deltavision device is simple to use.  A camera in the middle of a
visual keyboard facing the patient focuses on the eye.  A red beam
reflects eye movement back to the machine.  Users need only look at a
key for less than a second for it to register, and can write about 50
characters per minute.  However, the system will only work for
quadriplegics with eye movements that are normal.

The technique has been successfully used by 100 quadriplegics in pilot
projects at rehabilitation centres in Nantes, Le Mans and Bordeaux.
The prototypes cost $20,000, but once the device is marketed, possibly
next year, Association Delta 7 expects the price to go down because of
larger-scale production.

additional regulatory approval from any country," said Menahem Nassi,
president and chief executive officer.  "We believe that the CE mark
will streamline future product approvals, thus impacting the time to
market for our devices in key European markets."

Cardiometrics' products have been approved for use in most European
countries, and, to-date, more than 44,000 FloWire devices, the
company's lead product, have been sold for use in more than 300 medical
centres worldwide.  International sales currently account for about 75
per cent of Cardiometrics' revenue, as recently reported by the company
in its year-end earnings.

LASERSCOPE SEEKS BRAND RECOGNITION IN EUROPE

LONDON - Laserscope of California has received the Conformite Europeene
(CE) and International Standards Organisation (ISO) 9001 registration
from the British Standards Institution.  Robert McCormick, Laserscope
president and chief executive officer said, "These certifications will
allow us to compete more effectively in Europe and other international
markets by greatly simplifying the regulatory approval processes."

"Because the CE mark allows us to market the same model product in each
European nation," he said, "Laserscope brand recognition should grow.
From a manufacturing standpoint, we will no longer be compelled to
design, build and inventory different product configurations for each
individual country."

In 1995, international revenues represented 23 per cent of Laserscope's
total revenues, compared to 17 and 13 per cent of total revenues in
1994 and 1993, respectively.

Laserscope designs, manufactures, sells and services an advanced line
of medical laser systems and energy delivery devices for the hospital,
outpatient surgical centre and physician office markets.  It sells its
products in the US, the UK and France through its own direct sales
force and serves 20 other countries in Europe, the Middle East and the
Asia-Pacific region through regional distributors.

The Easi-Breathe inhaler is a proprietary product of the respiratory
franchise of the Ivax Corp (US).  With this inhaler, the company says
the patient does not need to co-ordinate inhalation with actuation,
because the active ingredient goes directly to the lung, not to the

FDA APPROVES CHOLESTEROL SYSTEM

NEW YORK, NY - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved
Liposorber LA-15 System, a medical device manufactured by Kaneka
America Corp of New York to lower cholesterol in people who, because of
a genetic disorder, have extremely high cholesterol levels and are at
very high risk of heart attacks early in life.  This small group of
people, about 4,000 in the US, is not helped by low fat diets and
cholesterol lowering medications.

The device is a filtering system that removes low density lipoprotein
(LDL) from the blood via a plastic tube inserted into the patient's arm
and connected to the filtering machine.  The process, similar to kidney
dialysis, is performed at a medical facility and takes about three
hours to remove the "bad" cholesterol and must be repeated every one to
two weeks.

A clinical study of 74 patients, who were on cholesterol lowering drugs
and diet, were treated with the device at 11 US sites.  After each
treatment the LDL levels in all patients were immediately reduced;
however, after 14 to 30 days, the LDL rose to levels that were apparent
before treatment.  Long-term benefits of the treatment, such as whether
it reduces angina, heart attacks or death, were not shown.

FDA is requiring the manufacturer to establish a patient registry to
track patients who receive this treatment in order to help determine
long-term risks and benefits.  Patients who receive this treatment
should remain on a low fat diet and continue to take cholesterol-
lowering medication.

FDA REJECTS NON-INVASIVE BLOOD SUGAR TESTING DEVICE

PITTSBURGH, PA - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Clinical

approval Biocontrol Technology's non-invasive glucose sensor for
diabetics.  The meeting held in late-February 1996 was sparked with
emotional, fiery and combatant exchanges by the public and the sponsor
directed against the advisory panel.

calibrated in a four hour process to recognise the individual user's
particular glucose pattern by calling on internal algorithms.  Once the
calibration has been completed, the forearm is placed on the sensor,
the start button pushed, and infrared light passes through the skin
into the blood and is reflected back to the sensor's computer.  The
pattern is analysed, converted to a blood glucose level, then displayed
on a digital screen quickly.

The company's device, if it was approved, would most likely have
replaced the current monitoring devices on the market today.
Presently, all devices that are on the market require an invasive
pricking of one's finger up to 10 or more times a day to monitor and
maintain accurate control of diabetes.  This is a painful and
debilitating experience for diabetics, especially children.

The meeting was marked by passionate pleas to the panel for approval of
the device during the open public session by mothers of diabetic
children and young and old diabetics.  Each speaker had a story of the
hardships of invasive testing and the resultant physical and
psychological injury suffered.  Even the company was engaged in heated
exchanges with members of the panel.

The main reasons for not recommending approval of the device were based
on the fact that the clinical study data presented by the company do
not support the intended use of the device.  There were 85 persons
initially enrolled in the clinical study but only eight were able to
qualify and complete the study.  The scale used to access accuracy of
the data was not acceptable because it was not considered an accurate
measure of error, said the panel.

The committee said more data are needed over a longer period of time,
and further study is needed with an increased number of patients,
including pregnant women and children.

MIDAC RECOMMENDS IN FAVOUR OF IMMUNOMEDIC'S CEA SCAN

ROCKVILLE, MD - Immunomedics Inc of New Jersey announced that the
Medical Imaging Drugs Advisory Committee (Midac), an external advisory
panel for the US Food and Drug Administration, unanimously recommended
approval for CEA-Scan, the company's diagnostic imaging product for
colorectal cancer.The FDA will now review the panel's decision.

"We are delighted that our first cancer imaging and diagnostic product
is in the final stages of the regulatory approval process and that the
panel recommended CEA-Scan's use in several settings," said Dr David
Goldenberg, chairman of Immunomedics.

CEA is expressed by more than 90 per cent of colorectal cancers, as
well as by a large number of other carcinomas, including lung, breast,
pancreas, uterus, and ovarian, and it has been show that this tumour
marker can serve as a useful target for radiolabeled antibodies.

In addition to CEA-Scan, the company's infectious disease imaging
agent, LeukoScan is undergoing regulatory review in Europe for imaging
osteomyelitis (bone infections).

FDA CLEARS PHADIATOP ALLERGY TEST

LONDON, CO - Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc received US Food and Drug
Administration clearance to market Phadiatop, a yes/no blood test to
determine whether a patient has an inhalant allergy.  Physicians using
the test take a blood sample to run through Phadiatop system to test
for a variety of different substances that may cause allergies.  The
results are obtained within hours.  The test is an alternative to skin
testing.

Mark D Myslinski, general manager for the Diagnostics Division of
Pharmacia & Upjohn, said that the Phadiatop system offers "physicians
and laboratories a blood test that may determine whether a patient's
symptoms are being caused by allergy or by a cold".  He noted that by
accurately diagnosing the cause of symptoms that are so similar,
appropriate treatment can be provided within a short time.  It is
estimated that 30 per cent of the US population suffers from allergy
symptoms.

Phadiatop is the latest in a panel of allergy tests that are offered in
the company's Pharmacia CAP System.  This system is currently being
used in over 2,000 laboratories worldwide.

VITRASERT CLEARED FOR MARKETING

EMERYVILLE, CA - Vitrasert, an intraocular implant system to deliver
ganciclovir directly to the eye for the treatment of cytomegalovirus
(CMV) retinitis in people with Aids, was cleared for marketing by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Manufactured by Chiron Corp
(California) the device will be marketed and co-promoted by Chiron
Vision and Roche Laboratories, producer of Cytovene-IV (ganciclovir
sodium).

The Vitrasert implant is surgically placed in the posterior portion of
the eye through a five to six millimetre incision and allows the
sustained diffusion of ganciolovir locally for five to eight months.
The implant can be removed and replaced, after drug depletion.  The
implant procedure is undertaken in an out-patient setting and usually
takes less than one hour.

SCALAR LAUNCHES SKIN MOISTURE TEST

TOKYO - Scalar Corp, a Japanese maker of video microscopes for medical
and industrial applications, has developed an inexpensive and light-
weight moisture checker.  According to a company spokesman, patients
place one end of the device on their skin, usually the face.  After
five seconds, the Scalar Moisture Checker beeps and gives a read out of
moisture content.

Scalar Corp hopes to expand the market for moisture checkers with its
new product.  The company claims conventional models are relatively
expensive so they are rarely installed in places other than a
laboratory.  However, the Scalar's device weighs 85 grams and sells for
Y12,800 ($134).

A prototype of the Scalar Moisture Checker was completed in March and
mass production is expected to commence in the near future at the
company's factory in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

The spokesman expects beauty shops and department stores to be the
first customers.

Scalar Corp also believes the product will be a success amongst
dermatologists.  It is investigating worldwide regulations, after which
it will make a final decision about how and when to approach the
medical community.

OMRON'S BLOOD PRESSURE MONITOR

TOKYO - Omron Corp, Japan's largest maker of blood pressure monitors,
recently launched what it calls the world's smallest and lightest hand-
held blood pressure monitor.

The digital blood pressure monitor HEM-808F uses a small optical sensor
in a finger cuff to measure blood flow.  The cuff collapses into the
body of the device after use.  It measures only 9x6x3 cm - about the
size of a pack of cigarettes, so customers can carry it with them at
all times.

A company spokesman reports that Omron developed the product because
conventional models are too large for portability.  "Patients should be
able to take a reading whenever they feel the necessity to do so," the
spokesman said.

The company plans to launch the monitor in all major international
markets by end-1996, if the time required for satisfying local
regulations of each country permits.

Production of the HEM-808F is underway at Omron's plant in Mie
Prefecture, Japan.

SMARTLIGHT ATTRACTS INVESTMENT

HAIFA - A group of Israeli investors including the Walden Israel Fund,
the Mofet Fund, and Quantum and Evergreen, invested $1.6 million in
Smartlight, a high-tech medical device company.

Smartlight has developed a sophisticated light box that enhances the
reading of X-rays.  The system is based on electro-optics technology.

Dan Inbar, one of the company's founders and vice-president of research
and development, explained to MDBN that the light box extracts the
picture at a much deeper resolution than the standard light box used by
hospitals.  He says the box will greatly reduce the 30 per cent margin
of error currently found in radiological studies.

"We studied the psycho-physic limitations of the human eye and
developed a light box that works with those limitations," he said.

The light box was introduced last year in the US, "with great success",
said Mr Inbar.  The company, which plans to produce the product in
Israel, has already started to sell it in the southwest region of the
US and has further plans to expand in Europe.

This is the second time Walden has invested in Smartlight.  It now owns
a 12 per cent stake in the company.

EUROPEAN STANDARDS TRY TO BREAK LANGUAGE BARRIER

BRUSSELS- New European standards on the information to be provided by
manufacturers of medical devices and the graphical symbols which may be
used are expected to be published before the end of this year.  John
Webster, who chairs the European working group responsible for the
standards, believes the adoption of new symbols for use on medical
devices will greatly assist manufacturers in marketing their products
throughout Europe.

He says the European Committee on Standardisation (CEN) is likely to
adopt standardised symbols for "do not reuse" (the number 2 with a line
drawn through it), a "use by" symbol showing an egg timer, and other
symbols for sterile, date of manufacture, serial number and batch
number.

The new symbols are likely to be welcomed by an industry for which
language requirements are becoming an increasing burden.  More and more
European Union member states are insisting that devices be in local
language packaging.  Some countries which once accepted English, such
as Sweden and Norway, now require the instructions for use to be in
their own language.  Others are considering adding a second or third
language requirement.

Mr Webster says this causes problems for manufacturers, as some words
and phrases do not easily translate into other languages.  He believes
the new language requirements are pushing up the cost of medical
devices - at a time when governments are struggling to contain
healthcare costs.

UK GROUP TO SHOW TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITIES TO US COMPANIES

LONDON - Officials of the County Durham Development Company (UK) met
with representatives of more than 25 Indiana-based medical device
manufacturers to encourage them to do business in the UK.

As part of the effort to attract US investment, the CDDC is sponsoring
a medical technology fair in late-May to show the US companies what
they have to offer.  The event, which will exhibit over 100 new medical
devices, will seek to license the inventions to medical device
manufacturers in the US and Europe.

Rob Allaker, international marketing executive for CDDC, told MDBN:
"The market is huge in Britain, the National Health Service imports 75
per cent of the medical devices it uses."

PRODUCT LIABILITY BILL HAS A CHANCE TO BECOME LAW

WASHINGTON, DC - The US Senate is expected to pass by end-March a
compromise bill that would reduce somewhat the potential legal
liability of companies selling medical devices in the US.  The House of
Representatives, however, has not yet scheduled a date for
consideration of the measure.

The compromise bill was worked out by a conference committee, composed
of members of the Senate and House.  That committee was charged with
resolving the major differences between the House bill that was highly
favourable to industry and the more narrow Senate bill that passed the
respective chambers last year.  If the compromise bill is passed by
Congress, it is expected to be signed into law by President Clinton.

Some good news for industry

The bill does provide some good news for the medical device industry,
although provisions most sought by the industry are missing.  The bill
severely limits the liability of biomaterial suppliers for injury from
a medical implant or device.  Biomaterial suppliers would be liable
only if a claimant establishes that the supplier failed to meet the
contract requirements or specifications for the implant, or failed to
properly register the implant with the secretary of Health and Human
Services.  In addition, the bill provides an expedited dismissal
procedure for medical device defendants.

Absent from the bill, however, is language that would bar those who
claim they were injured by medical devices from winning punitive
damages if the product had been approved for sale by a regulatory
agency except under extremely limited circumstances.  The legislation
does limit punitive awards assessed against those found liable in court
for selling products that injure consumers and ends joint and several
liability for injuries.  It also bars suits for products sold more than
20 years before the injury is claimed and gives consumers only two
years after they suffer an injury to claim damages.

In general, the cap on punitive damages is the greater of twice the
compensatory (economic and non-economic) damages, or $250,000.  This is
a cap that pre-empts state laws to the extent that they are more
permissive.  Moreover, sellers may not be held strictly liable or
liable on the basis of a breach of an implied warranty.  This bill
would also extend this standard to any entity that rents or leases a
product by providing that such an entity shall not be liable for the
act of another, solely by reason of ownership of such product, but
shall be liable under the same standards as applied to product sellers.

Actions for commercial loss are excluded from the scope of the bill.
Thus, the bill does not apply to a business seeking its lost profits if
a defective product causes a work stoppage.

The fact that the bill was near passage prompted consumer groups to
launch a last-minute public campaign to pressure members of Congress to
vote against it.  Officials of Citizens Action and the Consumers Union,
at a news conference on 7 March said: "The legislation would gut the
laws that now protect Americans from defective and dangerous products
and let manufacturers that put profit before safety get away with their
misconduct."

Steven Spiel, associate vice-president for policy and communications
for Health Industry Manufacturers Associations, however, said this is
not the case.  "This bill will do a great deal to encourage companies
to continue to invest in new innovative products for US patients and
will help keep jobs in the US as well.  In fact, this bill is great
news for consumers."

"It will only limit punitive damages, and it will eliminate the lottery-
like system which serves no one," Spiel said.  "In many instances, the
reward has little relationship to the damage alleged," he said.

FDA TO EASE RULES FOR LOW-RISK DEVICES

ROCKVILLE, MD - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is exempting
122 categories of low-risk medical devices from pre-market review,
adding to the 450 categories already exempted from such review.

The agency, in an "FDA Talk Paper", states this action is part of the
drug and medical device reforms announced last spring as contained in
the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review.  The agency
also said it is in line with its commitment to speed up patient access
to new medical devices.

The devices to be exempted from the review include: gas pressure
gauges, oxygen masks, pacemaker chargers, dental floss, pneumatic
tourniquets, patient scales, examination lights and therapeutic
massages.

These products will continue to be regulated by the FDA and remain
subject to good manufacturing practice regulation, FDA factory
inspections, and other general reports.  However, the exemption means
that manufacturers will be allowed to market the products without
getting prior clearance from the agency.

To exempt the products, the agency reclassified three categories of
devices from Class II (medium risk) to Class I (low risk).  In
addition, the agency exempted two categories of devices already in
Class I.  The medical devices amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act and FDA regulation allow certain types of Class I devices to be
exempted from pre-market review.

With this action, notes the FDA, nearly 75 per cent of all Class I
devices are now exempt from pre-market review.  This represents one-
third of all classified medical devices.

The final regulation listing the 122 exempted device categories became
effective on 15 February.  All manufacturers who had pre-clearance
submissions pending FDA review on 15 February should have been notified
by letter that their device is exempt.

Meanwhile, the FDA has just published a proposed rule in the 14 March
Federal Register for analyte specific reagents to be reclassified as
restricted devices.

1996 PASSAGE OF FDA REFORM BILL IN QUESTION

WASHINGTON, DC - Despite strong support from the US medical device
industry, it remains uncertain whether legislation mandating prompt
Food and Drug Administration action on applications for new device
approvals will win congressional support this year.  Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-Kansas) chairman of the Senate Labour and Human Resources
Committee, has called for a mark-up late this month on her FDA reform
bill, S.  1477.

Because of a heavy congressional schedule and the fact that it is a
presidential election year, some observers say the legislation will not
be passed.

Moreover, Representative Thomas Bliley (R-Virginia), chairman of the
House Commerce Committee, has yet to introduce his version of the FDA
reform bill, nor has he indicated when he could possibly introduce such
legislation.

Also, the opposition of FDA Commissioner David Kessler to the Kassebaum
bill has dampened its chances for passage.  In testimony before
Kassebaum's committee Mr Kessler said he backed the principles of the
Kassebaum bill, but called for changes in the legislation to ensure
safety.  He criticised key portions supported by the industry,
including provisions to set shorter timetables for approval of devices
and allowing third parties to take part in the review process.

Mr Kessler told the panel: "Improvements also have been made in the
timetable for the review and approval of medical devices.  With respect
to the 510(k) process, through which 98 per cent of all medical devices
evaluated by FDA reach the market, the average review time in fiscal
year 1995 was 137 days, down 24 per cent from the 184-day average in
fiscal year 1994.  The average review time for those devices needing
premarket applications is still too long, but we are making progress
there as well.  The average PMA review in fiscal year 1995 was 20
months."

Mr Kessler proposed to Congress on 12 March, that user fees be imposed
on the industry to permit the FDA to hire more people to expedite the
review of new products.  While several medical device companies favour
the fees, the two major trade associations representing large and small
manufacturers strongly oppose such action (the Health Industry
Manufacturers Association and the Medical Device Manufacturers
Association).

UNCERTAINTY OVER MRI ORDER

VANCOUVER - Ontario radiologists still hope that the Ontario government
will honour a promise to approve the addition of 23 more magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scanners to the province's present 12 in
service, even though the commitment dates back to November l994, before
the present provincial government was elected.  So far, the Health
Ministry has given no word.

Desmond Walker, president of the Ontario Association of Radiologists
said, "The approval of these MRI scanners would dramatically reduce the
nine-month waiting lists which are believed to be the longest in the
industrialised world." Turkey, he noted, has more MRI scanners per
million people than Canada does.

MEDICAL DEVICE MAKERS URGED TO LOOK EAST FOR NEW BUSINESS

WASHINGTON, DC - The US Commerce Department's export promotion
officials are telling US medical equipment makers to look to Asian
markets for medical devices.  Asian markets are growing at double-digit
rates, much faster than the traditional markets of North America,
Europe and Japan, reported the US Journal of Commerce.

Global trade patterns are shifting and "we are encouraging (the US)
industry to focus more on Asia" as well as Latin America, said Jeffrey
Gren, director of Commerce's Office of Microelectronics, Medical
Equipment and Instrumentation.

Besides supplying US medical device makers with market data, Commerce
officials help arrange trade missions, exhibits and seminars key to the
Asian market.  They also work directly with foreign governments to
improve market access.

The US represents roughly half of the world's $90 billion a year
medical device market, but its share is shrinking, as Asia and Latin
America's shares rise, Mr Gren said.

In China, said Commerce analyst Paul Barry, "We expect sales to
increase dramatically over the next couple of years", as China embarks
on a new five-year plan.

Help manufacturers cash in

To help US manufacturers cash in, Commerce is arranging a US visit by
members of the People's Liberation Army, which operates hundreds of
hospitals and thousands of clinics in China.

In May, a US medical-dental industry trade mission will visit China,
and in June, the United States plans to take part in a Beijing
International Medical Equipment Exhibition.

South Korea, Taiwan and India also are among other fast emerging Asian
markets.  Boosting US sales prospects, South Korea's Health Ministry is
due to announce guidelines simplifying its testing and other medical
device regulations.  Taiwan is moving to a "universal coverage" health
system, though it may soon issue new rules that could force down US
medical device prices.

In India, said a Commerce analyst, "we see rapid growth for high-end
medical products, such as diagnostic and imaging equipment".

TURKMENISTAN REQUIRES LICENSING OF MEDICAL EQUIPMENT

ASHKHABAD - As part of its new healthcare reforms, Turkmenistan has
introduced new rules for registration of medical equipment and
pharmaceuticals.  Under the rules, implemented on 1 March, all
producers and suppliers of the medical equipment and pharmaceuticals
must register with a new department in the Health Ministry created for
this purpose.

Equipment without the proper registration and documentation are
prohibited from being imported to the country.  The licensing system is
part of the country's healthcare reform which started at the beginning
of this year.  Turkmenistan also introduced medical insurance in
January.

SECTOR TO SEE "MODEST GROWTH"

SYDNEY - The Medical Industry Association of Australia published its
industry analysis for 1994 in its annual survey: "Industry Survey
Number 4".

The analysis of industry trends is based on data from 33 companies.
Although the number of companies involved in the supply of medical
devices and diagnostics in Australia is thought to exceed 600, MIAA
says the 33 companies constitute, in terms of sales, the "core"
industry.

Companies engaged in local manufacture have experienced sharply
different trading conditions over the period to those engaged solely in
importing.  "Importers have experienced continuous and substantial
sales growth in both the domestic and re-export markets while local
manufacturers have faced little growth in domestic sales and widely
fluctuating export levels," reports MIAA.

Reflecting these contrasting market conditions, manufacturing (and
overall) employment levels contracted sharply, despite modest growth in
non-manufacturing staff numbers.

Sharp differences across the various segments of the domestic market
were seen in 1994, with growth rates in the private hospital sector far
outstripping those in the public hospital market.

The diagnostics sector of the industry would have felt the impact of
these market changes more severely than the devices sector, since the
bulk of diagnostics sales are concentrated in the slower-growing
segments of the market.

Because of the diversity of the results, MIAA says it is difficult to
predict the outlook for future growth, but the group says at best, the
outlook is for modest growth.

* Domestic sales to the public hospital sector remain the backbone of
the industry's activities, accounting for 46 per cent of total sales in
1994.

* The government currently finances around 44 per cent of all
expenditure on public hospitals; total Commonwealth outlays on hospital
services are projected to rise by only 12 per cent between 1994-95,
A$5.3 billion ($3.9 billion), and 1998-99, A$5.9 billion.

AUSTRALIA HELPS CHINA ESTABLISH AUDIOLOGY TECHNOLOGY COURSES

SYDNEY - Australia has agreed to help China establish audiology
training schools in the major teaching hospitals in Beijing and
Shanghai.  Each school will have a centre with facilities for assessing
hearing, fitting aids and making ear moulds.

Last year, representatives from three bodies, Australian Hearing
Services, Cochlear Pty Ltd, Ascom Audiosys, and a group of Australian
universities led by Macquarie University, met with Chinese officials to
set up a new cadre of Chinese ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists.
These specialists will train fellow ENT specialists in audiology using
the latest scientific devices and techniques.

A spokesman for Macquarie University said Australia would advise on
facilities, equipment and local staff, and the Chinese government would
pay for local costs.  Australia would also provide computer equipment
for programmable hearing aids and associated software for Australian-
made aids, he said.

Professor Philip Newall of Macquarie University commented: "Audiology
has developed rapidly with recent improvements in electronics, computer
science and technology.  It has become highly specialised in the West
with new branches such as clinical, paediatric, industrial, educational
and hearing-aid audiology.  Hearing devices too are increasingly
sophisticated.  As yet, there is no formal audiology school in China.
ENT departments in hospitals and rehabilitation centres fit mainly
children with hearing aids.  The rest of the population buys them
through department stores without testing or fitting."

Professor Newall is also closely associated with an increasing
Australian presence in audiology in Thailand.  "The Thai government is
providing hearing aids free of charge under a new law for the
disabled," he said.  "The initial contract is for 6,000 units, and it
is hoped some will be made in Australia and fit to Australian
specifications."

INCONTROL TO START CLINICAL TRIALS

BRUSSELS - InControl Inc (Europe operations, Belgium) has submitted its
application to European authorities to begin clinical implant trials of
the Metrix atrial defibrillation system in up to 12 selected centres in
Europe.  At the same time, the company has also submitted an
application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting
permission to start US trials.

Though implanted pacemakers have long been used to treat slow heart
rhythms and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are used to
treat ventricular fibrillation, the Metrix atrial defibrillator is one
of the first devices designed especially for patients with atrial
fibrillation.

Intended to be placed and programmed by physicians using techniques
similar to those used for implanting pacemakers, the Metrix atrial
defibrillator is designed to detect the presence of atrial fibrillation
and deliver a low-energy carefully-timed shock to convert the rhythm to
normal.

PORTABLE DIALYSIS MACHINE PROVES "SMOOTHER & GENTLER"

VANCOUVER - A nocturnal hemodialysis system has just completed two
years of clinical testing at Toronto's Wellesley Hospital.  The team
doing the test has recommended to the Ontario Health Ministry that the
treatment be made standard for patients requiring dialysis.

The modified dialysis machine was designed by Dr Robert Udall of
Toronto Western Hospital, with a grant from the Health Ministry.
Compared to conventional dialysis, which is done two or three times a
week for three or four hours, under nursing supervision, the operation
of the eight-hour-a-night dialyser is described as "smoother and
gentler".

The machine is linked by phone to a computerised monitoring station at
the hospital, and a technician calls the patient within two minutes of
any irregularity in its function.  In two years testing on six
patients, no emergency home visits were required.  The design of the
machine is presently being refined in order to make it more portable,
so that a patient could travel with it in his luggage.

Dr Andreas Pierratos, head of the Wellesley team, says that the new
nocturnal dialysis system will cost only $25,000 a year per patient,
half the annual cost of conventional dialysis.  With 9,000 patients in
Canada requiring such treatment, the cost savings would be
considerable.

ST JUDE MEDICAL AND HEARTPORT TO TEST MITRAL VALVE REPAIR SYSTEM

ST PAUL, MN - St Jude Medical Inc and Heartport Inc (Redwood City,
California) received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for
its human clinical trials of its port-access mitral valve repair and
replacement system.

The surgical system permits less invasive port-access heart valve
surgery to replace and repair diseased heart valves.  It has the
potential to reduce trauma, pain and debility that can result from
conventional open-chest surgery.  Additionally, side effects, recovery
time and hospital stays and costs are reduced.

The port-access procedure allows surgery to be performed through small
incisions or "ports" between the ribs.  The system promises to replace
the traditional procedure for mitral valve surgery of opening the chest
or "cracking" it by making a large incision, sawing the breastbone in
half and forcibly spreading open the rib cage with a steel retractor.
This conventional surgical procedure usually requires that patients
spend eight to 12 days in the hospital and an equal time for recovery
at home.

Mechanical heart valve system

The two companies have a worldwide agreement to develop products,
supply components, as well as to patent, license and sell them.  St
Jude will sell a new, jointly developed product, the St Jude Medical
Port-Access Mechanical Heart Valve System that incorporates Heartport
Port-Access Technology.

St Jude Medical has an exclusive licensing agreement with Professor
Jacques Seguin of France for a unique, semi-rigid annuloplasty ring, a
product used in the repair of diseased heart valves that is compatible
with Heartport's Port-Access system.

PERCLOSE TO START CLINICAL TRIALS

MENLO PARK, CA - Perclose Inc has completed enrolling 500 randomly
selected patients for its Investigational Device Exemption trial for
the Prostar 9F and 11F Percutaneous Vascular Surgical systems.  The
company also announced that the initial human clinical testing of the
single suture Techstar 7F system has been completed and has validated
the device's safety and efficacy for human use.

The Prostar 9F and 11F are minimally invasive surgical systems used to
close arterial access sites following therapeutic catherisation
procedures, such as angioplasty and stenting.

Economic benefits

Hank Plain, Perclose's president and chief executive officer, said: "We
believe that the Prostar system provides patients with significant
clinical and economic benefits, including more rapid achievement of
hemostasis, reduced time to ambulation and increased patient comfort."

The Techstar 7F system was clinically tested and evaluated following
therapeutic and diagnostic coronary procedures in Canada.  Plain notes
that the Techstar system is offered in 6F, 7F and 8F sizes providing
physicians with a complete line of arterial access site management
devices that address the full range of clinical needs and physicians'
size preferences.

The company plans to begin marketing the system during the second
quarter 1996 in Europe, Japan and Canada.

IDS TO CLINICALLY TEST CTLM

SUNRISE, FL - Imaging Diagnostic System Inc has received approval from
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to begin clinical testing of
its Computed Tomography Laser Mammography (CTLM).

CTLM represents a painless and radiation free alternative to
traditional mammography.  The machine uses a high-speed laser and
sophisticated computer technology to produce ultra sharp three-
dimensional, cross-sectional images of the breasts, without discomfort
from breast compression.

The clinical trials under the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption
application will begin at the Strax Breast Institute in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida and will be expanded this year to screening
facilities at cancer detection centres across the US.

Dr Richard J Grable, chief executive officer and inventor of the
technology, said: "When the FDA granted a prompt review of our
applications, we were excited.  But now we're ecstatic it has resulted
in the FDA's first acceptance of clinical trials using our medical
optical imaging." The company projects more than $5 million in sales
this year in fulfilling orders from the Far East, Middle East and
Europe.

SLIGHT RISK FROM BREAST IMPLANTS

CHICAGO, IL - The largest study to-date on the health risks associated
with breast implants shows that women with implants are 24 per cent
more likely to self-report connective-tissue diseases than women who
have never had breast implants, according to an article in the late-
February issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

The researchers noted: "The data from this large retrospective cohort
study are compatible with previous recent reports from two other cohort
studies that provide reassuring evidence against a large hazard of
breast implants on connective tissue diseases." However, they also
indicate a small but significant increased risk of ...  any connective
tissue disease."

The researchers found the small increased risk remained virtually
constant regardless of the woman's age or how long she had the implant.

Connective tissue diseases are a group of disorders associated with
abnormality of the immune system in which the body reacts against its
own cells, tissues and organs.  The researchers found the increased
risk was of borderline statistical significance for rheumatoid
arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome (a condition where the eyes and mouth
become excessively dry), polymyositis or dermatomyositis (a rare,
sometimes fatal disease in which the muscles and skin become inflamed,
causing muscle weakness and a skin rash) and scleroderma (a rare
condition that can affect many organs and tissues of the body).

Dr Charles Hennekens, Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Massachusetts, and colleagues analysed questionnaires
completed by 395,543 female health professionals.  A total of 10,830
women reported they had breast implants and 11,805 reported they had
one of more connective tissue diseases between 1962 and 1991.

In 1992, the US Food and Drug Administration imposed a moratorium on
the use of silicone breast implants until their safety could be proved;
however, they are still available under clinical trials and women can
still get saline implants.

The results of the study are in line with FDA commissioner David
Kessler's testimony to Congress last year that the risk of getting a
serious disease from the implants is minimal.

The researchers noted: "Further research is necessary before firm
conclusions can be drawn.

The study was partially funded by former implant manufacturer Dow
Corning Corp.

IT TO CAPITALISE ON EXPERTISE IN POLYMER-BASED PRODUCTS

CHESHIRE UK - The implantable and extracorporeal devices sector provides
a $12 billion opportunity for sales of biomaterials, an area that has a
worldwide growth potential estimated at 7-12 per cent per annum.  This
market provides the Innovative Technologies (IT) Group with a huge
potential for capitalising on its research and development expertise in
alginate and polymer-based woundcare and medical products.

IT is aiming to establish itself as a"one-stop shop" for advanced
woundcare products and other medical devices based on its polymer
technology and to continue to gain market share as a supplier of
materials and manufacturing process technology.  Though IT's sales
focus at present is on alginate and polymer film-based woundcare
products, the company envisages a future in fields as far reaching as
self-lubricating hip joints, heart-assist devices, catheters, medical
and clean room gloves, condoms, and drug delivery.  In a number of
these areas IT is already involved in research with industry partners
including PharmaPlast AS (Norway), Nycomed AS (Norway) and Portex Ltd
(UK).  It is also carrying out research through the UK Department of
Trade and Industry LINK-funded programmes.

IT's core expertise in alginate and polymer woundcare products has
resulted in the development of tailor-made products for all categories
of wounds at various stages of healing.  The company quotes figures
which estimate the worldwide woundcare market to be some $9 billion,
with a hi-tech segment approaching $2 billion and growing at over 20
per cent annually.

Managing costs of healthcare

Managing the costs of healthcare is an increasing priority in any
number of medical fields, and to this end IT believes it can make
"unusually cost-effective" alginate and film dressings.  This is partly
possible through the ability of "intelligent film" to manage wound
fluid, resulting in a dressing which needs changing less frequently,
saving nursing time and therefore money.  Results so far suggest that
these dressings can be left in place for up to seven days.  To-date,
the design and development of a wide range of woundcare products has
been completed, including film, alginate, hydrocolloid, hydrogel and
special gauze dressings.  The company does not sell under its own label
but designs, develops, produces and manufactures for major companies
with "significant sales teams".

Focused research has been one of the keys to IT's success, financial
director David Chellingsworth maintains.  But there is also "a lot
bubbling beneath the surface".  Although the bottom line is to generate
revenues and profits for shareholders (the company was listed on the
USM in 1994, and now - as of a couple of weeks ago - on the London
Stock Exchange) it is important "not to lose track of the fact that you
must not stifle the creativity that lies beneath the surface".  (In
fact, IT's polymer technology does not stop at medical products, and
its offshoot textiles group is forming alliances with the aim to
develop waterproof, breathable textiles through the use of its
superurethane films as fabric coatings).

Unique position

IT also believes it has the potential to become one of the lowest-cost
producers of finished woundcare products, especially as alginate and
polysaccharide wound dressing manufacture has been integrated in house.
 The company sees itself "in a unique position" within the industry,
with fully integrated manufacturing capabilities for films, from
polymer design to finished products, including the facility to convert
and package many woundcare products, such as hydrocolloids and
hydrogels.

With major sales being generated by its line of "basic" alginate
dressings, the company has major clients in Europe and North America.
New products are planned for launch in the first half of 1996.  The
woundcare market is still open to innovation and new ideas, David
Chellingsworth suggests, with many more niches to explore.  IT has the
facilities and expertise to further develop any viable ideas brought to
the company from third parties.  The company recently invested in its
own leading edge conversion capability with laminating and packaging
facilities.  (The US market for custom conversion of non-woundcare
medical devices, excluding drug delivery patches, is $50 million, IT
claims).

The order books are filling steadily, David Chellingsworth says.
According to IT's chairman in his interim report at the end of last
year, the aim is to achieve annual sales in the order of #10 million
($15.9 million) within two years.  Though IT is quite a small company
(of some 80 individuals in total), it is targeting a fairly large
market with "top of the range" products.  Even a year or so ago there
was little to show in terms of sales, and no major contracts had been
signed.  Things have progressed a long way since then.

DEVICES SECTOR SETS SIGHTS ON MARKET AND INDICATION EXPANSION

LONDON - LocalMed, a California-based private medical devices company,
recently completed a $16 million private placement of preferred stock.
As lead investor, International Biotechnology Trust invested $3
million.  Hambrecht & Quist and Johnson & Johnson Development Capital
also participated in the preferred stock offering.

LocalMed markets devices which are used, in conjunction with balloon
catheters, to deliver drugs locally during angioplasty.  Its
InfusaSleeve system received FDA 510(k) approval in late-1994 and is
marketed by a direct sales force in the US and by distributors in the
rest of the world.  The local drug delivery catheter is used in
conjunction with a standard PTCA balloon catheter to deliver drugs to
the coronary arteries during angioplasty, effectively converting the
PTCA catheter into the drug delivery device.  LocalMed, founded in
1993, is developing other devices which will be used during cardiac
surgery.

Medtronic announced late-February that its Hemopump Cardiac Assist
System is being released to the cardiac surgery market in Germany and
on a limited basis to customers in other parts of Europe.  The Hemopump
is a catheter-mounted left ventricular assist system designed to
augment cardiac output.  The company is progressing toward US
regulatory approval to resume a modified clinical trial focusing on the
Hemopump's effectiveness during coronary bypass procedures.  Trials are
expected to take place during the 1997 fiscal year.

Keen support from city analysts

UK-based Cortecs, a biopharmaceutical company keenly supported by
several city analysts, hopes to launch before the end of the year a
simple rapid testing kit for osteoporosis.Analysts estimate the
potential size of the worldwide market for a diagnostic kit for
osteoporosis at up to $1 billion, three times bigger than that for any
other diagnostic product currently being sold.  A working prototype has
been established in collaboration with Danish company Osteometer
Biotech AS, and trials are expected to commence over the next three
months.  Cortecs took just eight months from the date of signing the
deal to create a working prototype.

Osteometer originated the bone breakdown technology, which Cortecs
secured access to last year through an exclusive licensing agreement.
The product has in recent studies been shown to be the only bone marker
which is predictive of hip fractures.

Combining diagnostics with therapeutics in a single disease area
provides enormous leverage when it comes to negotiating future
distribution and detail sales force arrangements.  Jonathan Pockson,
finance director of Cortecs, told MDBN: "If we can have a diagnostic
kit for osteoporosis, plus an oral version of calcitonin to handle the
disease, then effectively Cortecs will have a very strong control of
the disease state in a massive field.  It represents a significant
opportunity for the company and represents a follow on product from our
enabling technology.  "

Helisal, the company's recently-launched H.pylori diagnostic, is
proceeding as the company forecast.  Approval from the FDA is believed
to be imminent.  It is gradually building momentum in Europe as part of
H.pylori eradication therapy; H.pylori is a bacteria linked to stomach
ulcers, cancer and heart disease.  The results from the Phase II
studies of oral calcitonin are expected soon.  Cortecs posted "solid
all around progress" in its interim financial reports posted on 11
March, said the company.  It hopes to post profits in 1997.

International demand to grow quickly

California-based Microbics Corp, which develops and markets biosensor-
based systems for monitoring toxicity in environmental and process
control markets, is looking to raise about $20 million to fund the
expansion of sales and marketing and to support new systems
development.  International demand for toxicity testing is expected to
grow quickly over the next five years.

The anticipated pre-money valuation of $40 million offers considerable
upside for a company with forecast net earnings in excess of $20
million in 2001.  The company plans to move its headquarters to the UK,
with a full flotation on the London stock market in early 1998.

Shield Diagnostics expects within the next month to announce
preliminary data from the current Houston-based trials on its lab-based
test (AFT), for activated factor 12 a diagnostic test to predict
susceptibility to coronary heart disease.  Market estimates put the
market for such a test at between #50 and #100 million.  Further
product enhancements are likely, perhaps with a rapid assay test for
point-of-care use.
