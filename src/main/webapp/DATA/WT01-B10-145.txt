<H2>News From Our Alumni</H2>
<B>Dr. Jack R. Vinson</B> ('51, BME '52), the H. Fletcher Brown Professor
of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Delaware, writes
that several other Cornell alumni are in his department, including <B>Michael
D. Greenberg</B> ('56, BME '58, PhD(Mech) '64) and <B>Leonard Schwartz</B>
('64, A&amp;EP '65, ME(Aero) '66).  Professor Vinson also mentions that
he keeps in touch with classmates <B>George Sutton</B> (BME '52) and <B>Charlie
Moore</B> ('51, BME '52) (who recently returned to Cornell as Athletic Director).
 For many years Sutton has been Editor-in-Chief of the AIAA Journal.  <B>Jim
Withington</B> ('87) and wife became parents last year for the first time.
 After completing his Ph.D. at Penn State, Jim has been taking care of his
parents' farm in southwest Oregon, while his father recovers from illness,
and is also doing some consulting in his spare time.  <B>Spencer Kellog
II</B> ('37) is currently an Aviation Consultant with offices at the Islip
MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma, on Long Island, New York.  <B>Israel Katz</B>
(MME '44), a former faculty member of the Cornell Aero School dropped us
a note to reminisce about the time <B>Ed Resler</B> and <B>Frank Moore</B>,
recently retired from our faculty, were students in his class.  Professor
Katz was for many years Dean at Northwestern University, and in 1993 was
presented with the New England Award by the Engineering Societies of New
England.  He continues to consult actively in the Boston area.<BR>
