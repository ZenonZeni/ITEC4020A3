find it very helpful and promising. - P.E. of New York, NY</i> </p>

Growth Stocks Report. I have only been taking it since October, 1995
... and I have been making money consistently ever since then.
You certainly do pinpoint good stocks. I even carry around a
Quotrek now. I would have never heard of these particular stocks,
if it wasn't for the newsletter. Several of my friends also take
your newsletter now. Thank you so much ...You are the Best!!!!! -
