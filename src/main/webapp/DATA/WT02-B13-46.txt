The purpose of this conference is to explore the evidence to support

or disprove the hypothesis that: &quot;The United States risks

re-creating rural poverty through immigration. This rural poverty

may be even more difficult to extirpate; since it requires overcoming

language and education barriers in an economy that penalizes with

low earnings workers without education and skills.&quot;

</FONT></H1>


<P>

This conference was motivated by three &quot;facts:&quot;<BR>


<OL>

<LI>The populations of many cities and towns in agricultural areas

of CA are increasing, often by 3 to 5 percent per year, versus

1 percent per year for the US as a whole, and this rural population

growth is driven largely by youthful immigrants and their children.


</OL>


<OL>

<LI><FONT SIZE=2>2.     </FONT>There is almost a 1 to 1 relationship

between the number of immigrants arriving in rural areas and the

number of poor adults with few years of education. There are more

uncertain and lagged effects of population growth near major centers

of labor-intensive crop production and growth in the number of

children in K-12 education, the number of persons on AFDC and

other welfare programs, and the number of persons in criminal

justice and other systems. 

</OL>


<P>

Some data suggest that growth in the number of poor immigrants

in rural California is NOT associated with indicators of welfare

use, both because unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for

such assistance and because many are in intact families that are

hoping to succeed in the US through hard work. Other data suggest

that many immigrants seek public assistance for their eligible

US-born children and themselves, and that social service usage

can be expected to increase in an S-curve fashion as settled immigrants

develop networks that take them from low-wage and seasonal US

jobs to the social service system.<BR>


<P>

3. There is agreement that the rural poverty of the 1990s in rural

California is DIFFERENT from the rural poverty of the south and

the midwest in the 1940s and 1950s that shaped social scientists

perceptions of rural poverty, and federal government solutions

for rural poverty. The conventional wisdom in the 1960s concluded

that the best way to eliminate lower-than-average rural wages

and incomes was by helping farmers and farm workers to move to

urban jobs. Moving excess human resources out of agriculture,

it was hoped, would set in motion a series of adjustments that

would ultimately improve the economic status of those who moved

and those who remained behind.<BR>


<P>

There is widespread agreement that an &quot;encourage movement

to urban areas&quot; policy will not &quot;cure&quot; rural OR

urban poverty in the 1990s. First, the number of rural poor in

rural CA seems to increase in lockstep with job opportunities

there--despite stepped-up border controls, migrants continue to

arrive to fill jobs vacated by settled persons who abandon seasonal

farm work, and new jobs created in an expanding labor-intensive

agriculture. <BR>


<P>

Second, urban areas such as Los Angeles do not offer the blue-collar

manufacturing jobs that permitted 1950s rural-to-urban migrants

to use unions and prosperity to achieve upward mobility. Unlike

the 1950s, there is today a significant immigration from abroad

directly into urban areas such as Los Angeles, and there are fewer

blue collar jobs that can deliver upward mobility to immigrant

adults with typically less than six years of schooling.<BR>


<P>

This suggests that, while the 1960s promised &quot;virtuous circle&quot;

types of adjustments--federal assistance programs reinforced economic

factors to promote migration and upward mobility in both rural

and urban areas--in the 1990s, &quot;vicious circles&quot; may

be created, in which adults &quot;used up&quot; in the seasonal

farm labor market after 10 to 15 years find few alternatives in

rural areas other than providing services to new arrivals, and

their children educated in often weak rural school systems reject

the seasonal farm jobs of their parents, but do not have the skills

needed to succeed in local or distant nonfarm labor markets.<BR>


<H1><A NAME="_Toc355930035"><FONT SIZE=4>Policy Recommendations</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

The roots of the rural poverty being created near centers of agricultural

production in California lie in the US and Mexico. In the US,

an ever-increasing wedge has been established between seasonal

farm workers and those who benefit from their services--in many

cases, the multi-tiered production system involves packer-shippers,

who buy from operators, who in turn lease land from owners, and

who rely on custom-harvesters and farm labor contractors to recruit

and manage seasonal workers. It is difficult to regulate this

layered production system, and very difficult for farm worker

organizations to effectuate lasting changes that would improve

their conditions.<BR>


<P>

In Mexico, there are millions of farmers and farm workers with

very low incomes, and little hope of achieving even the $3000

per person per year average Mexican income by staying in the place

where they now live. Thus, migration is an integral part of the

income-earning strategies of many rural Mexican residents, both

temporarily and permanently, and within Mexico and to the US.

However, there is general agreement that events in Mexico in the

1990s are encouraging especially young Mexicans to &quot;go north&quot;

for opportunity, either in the expanding factories in border areas,

or in the US.<BR>


<P>

Opportunity in rural America at a time when Mexico is poised to

undergo its &quot;Great Migration&quot; promise a continued influx

of newcomers to the towns and cities surrounding California's

ag production centers. There are four possible policy responses--at

the border, in US fields, in US towns and cities, or in rural

Mexico.<BR>


<P>

1. Reduce especially unauthorized entries at the border. This

is the strategy of the Clinton Administration, reflected in the

build-up of the border patrol and new fencing and lighting. Apprehensions

are up sharply in 1996, and so are smuggling fees, but it does

not appear that enough migrants are being stopped at the border

to put upward pressure on wages or working conditions in California

agriculture. <BR>


<P>

Indeed, there is pessimism that unauthorized immigration can be

slowed unless a far more effective employment verification system

is developed, something that Congress seems reluctant to embrace.

This leaves enforcement efforts concentrated on one of the three

major actors in unauthorized immigration--the smugglers who actually

help migrants to evade border controls. Unless and until enforcement

becomes effective against US employers, or unauthorized migrants,

unauthorized migration is likely to continue.<BR>


<P>

2. Make US farmers responsible for more of the costs associated

with seasonal farm work. It was noted that the divorce of many

farmers from their seasonal farm workers has reduced farm worker

take-home pay. Most farmers no longer house seasonal farm workers,

so that many workers pay $30 to $40 per week for housing in the

back yards of rural colonias, and then pay $4 to $6 daily for

rides to the fields. In addition, many workers must pay to have

checks cashed, and they face above-average prices for meals and

food in the businesses that cater to them.<BR>


<P>

There are exemplary public and non-profit housing and service

facilities in some rural towns, but there construction and operation

requires huge public subsidies, and they serve only a small fraction

of the farm worker population. These housing projects, clinics,

and day care centers appear to be islands of normalcy in seas

of poverty.<BR>


<P>

The &quot;divorce&quot; of farm operators and packer-shippers

from the seasonal farm labor force means that the farm workers

not lucky enough to get into public facilities typically spend

25 to 35 percent of their wages on services that were in the past

provided by the grower. There are several ways to re-establish

the link between workers and the beneficiaries of their labor--require

farm employers to provide or pay for housing, levy fees on commodities

for public housing, much as fees are levied for research and promotion,

or raise wages enough so that seasonal workers can afford to obtain

adequate housing with out subsidies.<BR>


<P>

Each of these responses would likely raise farm labor costs, but

there is not a one-to-one relationship between rising farm wages

and consumer prices. The US Consumer Expenditure Survey reports

that average consumer unit in 1993 spent $30,700, including $4400

on food (14 percent), $2700 on food eaten at home (9 percent),

and $270 on fresh fruits and vegetables eaten at home (less than

one percent). Farmers receive about one-third or $90 of the $270

spent on fresh fruits and vegetables, and labor costs are typically

one-third of farmers' costs, or about $30 or one-tenth of one

percent of average expenditures.<BR>


<P>

If farm labor costs were to double, and if all of the increased

labor costs were passed through to consumers, and there were no

adjustments such as increased imports or consumers shifting to

other commodities, then $60 in farm labor costs might raise the

$270 spent on fresh fruits and vegetables to $300--$60 in farm

labor costs would be about one-tenth as much as the average consumer

unit spent on maintenance and insurance on their house in 1993,

or one-tenth of what they spent on telephone service, or one-tenth

as much as the women and girls in the house spent on apparel.

<BR>


<P>

3. It may not be easy to change a farm production and labor market

system that has been shaped by immigration over the past century.

If unauthorized border crossings continue, and newly-arrived rural

Mexicans continue to find jobs in seasonal US agriculture, then

possible solutions to the &quot;new&quot; rural poverty associated

with the transfer of rural Mexicans to rural America may be found

in either in rural or urban America, or rural or urban Mexico.

<BR>


<P>

In rural America, a farm worker service economy has developed

in many areas-- the &quot;best jobs&quot; involve providing public

and private services to newcomers who need them. In a farm worker

town of 20,000, growing by 5 percent or 1000 per year, there may

be 5000 K-12 students to be taught, making the education system

the largest employer in many places, and generating &quot;good

jobs.&quot; Federal, state, and local jobs are also prized, as

our clinic and similar jobs.<BR>


<P>

The private farm worker service economy is driven by the needs

of often single male farm workers for housing, meals, transportation,

and other services. Those who study the farm worker service economy

have policy recommendations that can be framed by two extremes--don't

worry too much, because those being &quot;exploited&quot; by high

prices etc. are volunteers who took risks to cross the border

to escape even worse conditions, versus do worry--step up enforcement

of housing and other laws--because what the US and California

has established as minimum levels of decency are being violated

every day.<BR>


<P>

Young people wanting to escape from their parents as well as limited

opportunities in their communities have always been prone to migrate

toward &quot;bright lights.&quot; In the past, many youth raised

in rural towns migrated to cities such as Los Angeles. What awaits

them in LA? Census data suggest that Mexicans and Central Americans

are most likely to be trapped in the parts of the Los Angeles

labor market that is least likely to offer upward mobility. This

sets the stage for frustration rather than opportunity.<BR>


<P>

4. What about reducing the supply of immigrants that is changing

the face of rural California and rural America at its source,

in rural Mexico. Although not the subject of a great deal of discussion,

the facts offer little hope. There are 25 to 30 million people

in rural Mexico, and most are farm families that earn less than

one-third of Mexico's average income of $3000 per person per year.

<BR>


<P>

Most projections are that the farm population will be reduced

by about one million per year, the same rate of out migration

from agriculture that the US experienced in the 1950s. This shift

out of Mexican agriculture could be accommodated in Mexico, either

in rural areas with job creation, or in urban areas.<BR>


<P>

However, there is little prospect of rural job creation on the

scale necessary to make migration from rural towns unnecessary.

And once migration is necessary, then it is clear that established

networks are as likely to move rural Mexicans to rural America

as they are within Mexico, since they often have more relatives

and better job contacts in the US than elsewhere in Mexico.<BR>


<H1><A NAME="_Toc355930036"><FONT SIZE=4>Next Steps</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=4>

</FONT></H1>


<P>

The &quot;Changing Face&quot; title of this project is meant to

suggest that the demographics of rural America are changing rapidly,

as e Mexican, Central American, and Asian immigrants take jobs

in agriculture and agriculture related industries. The federal

government spends over $600 million annually on farm worker services,

and additional funds on rural development, but many of these programs

remain rooted in the 1960s philosophy that the solution for rural

poverty is rural-urban migration.<BR>


<P>

This project will be extended in two directions. First, we will

examine the policy recommendations outlined above in more depth

with federal policy makers. How much awareness is there of the

speed with which the demographics of rural America are changing?

To what extent have they thought about the need to revamp programs

begun in the 1960s to help persons trapped in agriculture to deal

with the integration of immigrants in the US?<BR>


<P>

Second, we intend to hold conferences in other areas of the US,

in which it appears that the composition of the farm and &quot;near

farm&quot; labor forces began to change very rapidly in the 1980s,

toward Hispanics and Asians in the midwest, and toward Hispanics

and Caribbean immigrants in the southeast and northeast. To what

extent are the patterns observed in CA also observed in these

other areas?<BR>


<P>

<CENTER><B>Conference Questions and Guidelines<BR>

</B></CENTER>

<P>

This is a working conference; we expect the 45 participants to

participate actively with researchers and local government officials

to discuss developments in these communities and what might be

done. A conference to discuss the policy implications of the rural

community studies presented at this conference is planned for

1997 in Washington DC.<BR>


<P>

<B>Community Studies Discussion Questions</B>

<P>

1. What are the major issues--pluses and minuses--associated with

high rates of immigration--adding one percent or more to the population

every year via immigration, or doubling the population of the

community when seasonal workers arrive? How would these issues

be affected if the inflow of new immigrants were stopped or significantly

reduced into your community, the aim of current border control

efforts and immigration reform legislation?<BR>


<P>

2. There is no generally accepted definition of immigrant integration.

However, when two or more distinct groups share a geographic area,

two extremes delineate their possible interaction--<B>integration

or assimilation</B> means eliminating boundaries between groups,

encouraging convergence in language, values, earnings etc. <B>Pluralism

or multiculturalism</B>, on the other hand, means encouraging

the maintenance of cultural diversity, and tolerating or welcoming

ethnic enclaves. These are sometimes referred to as the melting

pot versus the salad bowl approaches to accommodating immigrants.

<BR>


<P>

Which type of integration is occurring in your community/region?

Why? What are the major factors affecting integration in this

community/region, e.g., jobs, housing, schooling, governance?

What public policies are most important in regulating the speed

and extent of integration in your community/region, e.g., housing

for families, jobs for adults, or education for children?<BR>


<P>

3. Many newly-arrived immigrants find jobs with the help of ethnic

networks. Do immigrant networks in rural communities confine immigrants

to low-wage jobs, or give them a hand up the job ladder? Some

have speculated that rural communities are distinguished from

immigrant cities such as Los Angeles--where immigrants are concentrated

at the top and the bottom of the skill and earnings distribution--because,

in rural areas, the top or the role models are missing--there

is a pyramid-shaped distribution of skills and earnings, i.e.,

a wide base of low-skill people and jobs that tapers off abruptly.

Is this true in your community/region?<BR>


<P>

4. Federal and state governments are considering decentralization

and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing

local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would

decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the

eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect

immigration patterns in your community/region?<BR>


<P>

<B>Policy Implications Discussion Questions</B>

<P>

1. Are there any particular communities/regions or public or private

policies that stand out in promoting successful integration, or

in impeding immigrant integration? What are the communities that

currently have a majority of foreign-born residents, and continue

to grow by one to five percent per year via immigration, likely

to look like in 10 years if current trends continue, i.e., are

current immigration patterns sustainable?<BR>


<P>

2. What seems to be the most variable affecting the success of

integration--number of immigrants, characteristics of migrants,

situation and attitudes of the community in which they settle,

or some combination of these? What does this variable suggest

about prioritizing government efforts to accelerate integration

in immigrant communities in agricultural areas--should housing,

jobs, education, crime etc.-- be tackled first, and why? <BR>


<OL>

<LI>Federal and state governments are considering decentralization

and block grants--giving less assistance to communities, but allowing

local leaders to decide how to spend assistance funds. How would

decentralization and block grants--plus new restrictions on the

eligibility of legal and unauthorized immigrants for public benefits--affect

immigration patterns in your community/region?
