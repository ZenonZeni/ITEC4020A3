<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 224</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>Phasing out CFCs:<BR>
The Vienna Convention<BR>
and its Montreal Protocol</H1>
<HR>
<B>International legal efforts to protect the ozone layer also have important 
implications for climate change.</B> The 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of 
the Ozone Layer and the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone 
Layer do not directly address the issue of climate change. However, they do seek to phase 
out <A HREF = "fs031.html">chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</A> 
and halons, an important group of greenhouse gases. Elaborated under the auspices of the 
United Nations Environment Programme UNEP), the Vienna Convention commits its 
parties to protect human health and the environment against the "adverse effects" of 
human-induced modifications of the ozone layer. The Convention’s definition of "adverse 
effects" is very broad and includes "changes in climate". The Convention entered into 
force in September 1988 and, as of January 1993, 105 states and the European 
Community are parties to it.<P>
<B>As a framework convention, the Vienna Convention sets out broad principles . . 
.</B>            It requires states to cooperate on research into the causes and effects of 
ozone depletion and its possible climatic effects, as well as on alternative technologies; to 
cooperate on the adoption of legal and policy measures to counteract activities that are 
harmful to the atmosphere; and to facilitate the transfer of technology and the transmission 
of information, especially to developing countries. <P>
<B>...while the Montreal Protocol regulates the details.</B> The protocol entered into 
force on 1 January 1989. As of January 1993, 100 states and the European Community - 
accounting for over 95% of the world’s consumption of the substances controlled by the 
Protocol - had become parties to it.<P>
<B>The Montreal Protocol was amended and adjusted in June 1990 and November 
1992 to incorporate stronger measures.1</B> Whereas the Protocol originally obliged 
parties to reduce their production and consumption of CFCs by 50% by mid-1999 and to 
freeze their use of halons, the 1990 amendment provides for a complete phase-out of some 
of the controlled substances by the year 2000. The changes made in 1990 entered into 
force in 1992. At their 1992 meeting, the parties accelerated the phase-out, banning some 
gases by 1994 and others by 1996. In addition, they targeted some new substances for 
phase-out.<P>
<B>The Montreal Protocol regulates the production and use of CFCs, halons, and 
carbon tetrachloride, which are all <A HREF = 
"fs002.html">greenhouse gases</A>.</B> It obliges states 
to totally phase out these substances in accordance with the schedule. Because this may 
also help to reduce the greenhouse effect, many international climate meetings have 
strongly urged states to ratify the Montreal Protocol. The most relevant mechanisms of 
the Protocol, as amended in 1990 and 1992, are the following:<P>
	A schedule is established for phasing out the target chemicals;<P>
	Countries may "exchange" the rights to produce a particular substance as long as the 
total production permitted by the schedule is not exceeded;<P>
	The trade in controlled substances with non-parties will be banned in accordance with a 
schedule set out by the Protocol. Parties must discourage exports of technologies for 
producing the controlled substances, and refrain from granting subsidies or aid for such 
production, to non-parties;<P>
	Developing countries whose annual consumption of CFCs and halons is less than 0.3 
kilograms per capita may delay their compliance with the control measures of the 
convention for 10 years if their consumption never exceeds this level. Thus the Protocol 
establishes a dual standard for developed and developing countries;<P>
	Parties must regularly assess and review the provisions of the Protocol by, for example, 
convening special panels of experts;<P>
	An elaborate financing mechanism, including a Multilateral Fund initially containing 
US$160 million, was set up on an interim basis in January,1991 to provide financial 
assistance to developing countries. The fund is financed by the developed-country 
parties and was increased to US$240 million when China and India acceded to the 
Montreal Protocol. It was established on a permanent basis in 1992; <P>
	Various institutional mechanisms were also established, including an Implementation 
Committee (given a strengthened role in 1992), an Executive Committee, and an Ad 
Hoc Technical Advisory Committee on Destruction Technologies;<P>
<B>The Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol could serve as a model for 
the further development of the Climate Convention. </B>Like climate change, damage 
to the ozone layer is a global environmental issue of considerable complexity. The 
regulatory approach adopted in this case was to set out general principles in a framework 
treaty (the Vienna Convention) and to lay down specific rules in the Montreal Protocol. 
Measures were gradually strengthened as scientific findings influenced the political will to 
act. Due to the similarities between the two issues, climate change also lends itself to this 
formula: future protocols could provide more specific measures to strengthen the 
Convention. Indeed, as some of the problems that the two issues pose for developing 
countries are also similar, the <A HREF = "fs250.html">Climate 
Change Convention</A> already adopts some similar approaches.  Some of these 
problems are that developing countries, although at present producing only a small share 
of the harmful substances, will produce an increasing share as they develop economically; 
that developing countries may be impacted more severely than developed countries by 
climate change, since they have less capacity to adapt;  that reducing the consumption of 
harmful substances used in industrial processes may adversely effect the economic growth 
of developing countries, but growth is a priority for these countries; and that developing 
countries will need technical and financial assistance to implement the measures imposed 
by the treaties.<P>
