Don Mottram graduated from Leeds University with a BSc in Colour Chemistry in
1967 and a PhD in 1971. He was formerly head of the Flavour and Analytical
Section at the AFRC Meat Research Institute, Bristol. In 1988 joined the
University of Reading where he is Reader in Food Chemistry. His current
interests include flavour chemistry, methods for flavour analysis, flavour
binding and release, the occurrence of taints in food. He is chairman of the UK
Universities' Research Flavour Consortium.<p>
<p>
<b><i>Research interests</i></b><p>
These are mainly in the area of flavours, their analysis, and the factors
affecting their formation and retention in foods and beverages. The objective
is to provide means of enhancing or improving flavour in food.<p>
<i>Flavour formation during cooking</i><p>
During heating of food, flavour develops from the Maillard reaction between
amino acids and sugars and also from the oxidation of lipids. Current research
is aimed at understanding these complex reactions and the routes by which the
intermediates from both types can interact to give aroma and flavour compounds.
Work involves the study of model systems as well as investigations in food
products such as meat and extruded cereals.<p>
<i>Analysis of flavour in foods</i><p>
Both sensory evaluation and chemical analysis of volatile aroma compounds are
used to study the nature of flavour in foods and beverages. The techniques are
applied to both desirable and undesirable flavours and rely heavily on gas
chromatography and mass spectrometry.<p>
<b><i>Current Projects</i></b><p>
<ul>
<li>Flavour generation in extruded cereals. 
<li>The chemistry of meat flavour.
<li>Flavour of novel foods.
<li>Chiral compounds in the aroma volatiles of fruits.
<li>Flavour in foods processed by non-coneventional means.
<li>Phenolic components of exotic fruits.
