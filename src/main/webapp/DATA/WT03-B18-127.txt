of Robotics</H1>

ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="t.gif" ALT="T">wenty-five years ago, when I became one of the
industry's handful of robotics originator's, we made a bold but correct
assumption.  We believed companies that did not introduce robotics into their
manufacturing processes would surrender any competitive edge they held and would
lose the major benefits that the technology offered in improved productivity,
higher quality products, and reduced tine.  We were right.</P><P>Today, after
nearly three decades of living with the limitations in technology, the robotics
industry is taking advantage of a new revolution: PC-based simulation.  Software
that combines off-line calibration of robot and workcell has catapulted robotics
into the fast lane worldwide.</P><P>Simulation packages have been developed
based on the premise that PC's would become faster, cheaper and contain more
memory.  Developers predicted the Pcs' capabilities in the future would bring
them to am operating level where computer workstations are today.  Even the most
daring prognosticators underestimated the possibility or potential of PC-based
simulation software.  No one fathomed robotic simulations being done.  Receivers
need a personal computer with Microsoft Windows period.  Manufactures now are
focusing on these software developments, and the stakes are much higher than 25
or 30 years ago.</P><P>I predict this new approach to simulation, using a
standard PC, provides a universal solution to universal problems.</P><P>It is
changing the way we so business internationally now.  If you aren't already a
user, you are in the process of losing your competitive edge even as you read
this article.</P><P><B>OLD PROBLEMS,  NEW SOLUTIONS</B></P><P>Several
barriers have kept robotics simulation, off-line programming and on-line robot
and workcell calibration from reaching fill potential.  Today, those barriers
are gone   Wiped out.  Demolished by this new PC-based approach.  The
state-of-the-art for simulation is altered.</P><P>One of the greatest
challenges has been to devise a way to send a program to a robot, a program that
makes the robot perform flawlessly without human intervention.  Historically,
we've demanded inexpensive robot  hardware, then assumed the self-limited
posture that it's perfectly acceptable to stand with a robot and teach its
points by hand.  I have believed for more than 25 years that a teach pendent
must not be an acceptable way of life.</P><UL>
<LI><I>It's been an industry constant because to date, we never knew what the
real robot on the floor looked and acted like in comparison to what the &quot;perfect&quot;
robot in simulation-software looked and acted like.  It didn't matter that we
copied the manufacturer's specifications exactly.The mechanical model always had
something that didn't match the specified data.  Robots always have been
manufactured to be repeatable, not accurate.  The new generation of PC-based
simulation software solves that problem.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Price/performance has always been a major barrier.  The old method
required a non-portable computer system to operate the software.  Total costs
are about $110,000.  These systems have failed to successfully perform off-line
programming functions because they do not take into account the actual robot
kinematics.  Quantifying the actual robot's kinematics is left up to the others
at substantially higher costs.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Simulation's costs benefits and tine saving have industry members
looking for the fine print, the down side.  There is none.  Simulation, the
robotics industry breakthrough that users have been waiting for, and it s
already started to change the fabric of North American manufacturing.  Even
companies receiving proposals and products from suppliers now are insisting on
vendor simulations to accompany their proposals.  This forces a complete
analysis of a pries down the line to the component level.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Statistical analysis in simulation means we can provide predictions of
overall production on an annualized basis.  Once a user has created the
simulation, he or she can analyze cycle rates for all the pieces of equipment in
a workcell.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Simulation now can be used to layout the entire manufacturing prices-
from concept to finished production.  A user has the ability to &quot;test drive&quot;
a system at all levels of the process before committing hardware.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Simulations can be transmitted worldwide for analysis via E-mail of
Internet to anyone who has a PC- a major sales, engineering, manufacturing
advantage.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Simulation, formerly regarded as an engineering function, one becomes
an affordable vendor tool to show prospective buyers that the system works, and
the vendor has done his or her homework.</I></LI>
<LI><I>Simulation before starting floor operations prevents costly crashes and
downtime.</I></LI></UL><P>Simulation now provides an answer to the challenge of
calibration to be used in production.  This is rarely, if ever, the case.  :Lets
assume that the robot ordered  can reach exactly 2 meters.  But constraints in
the reach pattern are directly affected by the inaccuracies we find in every
robot.   The real robot, for a number of valid reasons, may not reach 2 meters,
it may fall 20-30 millimeters short.  Unless a calibrated robot model is used in
the simulation, and off-line program generated will most likely not work.  This
decade-old solution: Call the pipe fitters and bring a fork lift to relocate
parts of the system.  Software simulation now locates the problem before the
machines are bolted down, re-verifies at the time of installation, assists in
correcting any remaining problems.</P><P>Anyone who has even a passing
acquaintance of PC-based simulation and its potential applications doesn't need
to ask, &quot;What's on the horizon?&quot;  But I love it when they ask anyway. 
My predictions for the industry include:</P><P>Best estimates suggest the size
of the North American simulation market today is between $30 and $35 million. I
have now doubt that in the next couple of years, the market will have surged to
over $100 million, and the wave's crest isn't even in sight.</P><P>Within the
next two to five years, we'll see the widespread entry of PC-based open
architecture controls.  They will replace today's specialized controls that
require specialized interfaces.  I believe that leading PC simulation software
packages will plug and play on mist-if not all- of those PC controllers.  We'll
see- and demand- PC-based, resident  simulation in engineering at vendor
facilities builders shops and at production facilities.</P><P>Simulation will
be neutral to the robot and specific to the application. Systems integrators and
robot users will demand objective analyses of the entire range of robot 
manufacturing, and robot manufacturers therefore will not be in the field of
objective simulation analysis of robotic systems.</P><P>Factories with robots
from different manufacturers will increasingly rely on simulation and demand
services from companies that do not have ties to robot or supplier companies. 
Users will insist on an objective evaluation of robot function and system
performance  for a wide range of manufacturers products.</P><P>PC-based
simulation will be a global fact of life for manufacturers and users, and the
transition is underway.</P><P>Robot Simulation, Ltd., UK's research and
development team that selected the personal computer for simulation software
development, broke out of the mainframe minutes that crippled progress for
years.  What they created - a portable,  PC-based robotic simulation  program
with off-line programming and on-line robot calibration capabilities- means
every robotics manufacturer, systems integrator and robot user can have access
to an affordable and effective tool for increasing production profits.  I
believe, without hesitation or doubt, that PC-based simulation technology is the
sleeping giant of the 1990's.  And the giant has just yawned.</P><HR
