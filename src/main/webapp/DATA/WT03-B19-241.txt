<B><I>Australia</B></I>
<P>
Transport and storage contributed 5.8% of GDP in 1994-95 and has remained 
constant around 5.3% for ten years.
<P>
Australia's freight when measured in tonnes/kilometres was 4,245 billion in 1991,
 shared almost equally between rail, road and sea, with very little by air. When
 measured in dollar performance however, air freight accounts for 28% of total 
import value or 40% of total export value.
<P>
Road freight dominates freight transport in Australia moving 1000 million tonnes
 of freight per annum over an average distance of 90 kilometres. Most freight is
 carried interstate over relatively short distances (47% from Melbourne). Recent
 studies show that the road freight industry generally operates at a world best
practice level.
<P>
Rail is undergoing a restructure to lift its capacity to compete at an 
international best practice level. Rail is suited to bulk freight over long 
distances such as coal, ores, quarry products, grain and petroleum products. In non-bulk categories, rail faces fierce competition from road transport. Most of the increase in rail freight (4.5% between 1990-91 and 1991-92) was due to increases in coal volumes.

<P>
Air plays a significant role in transporting goods that are of high value and 
are time sensitive. Most freight goes on passenger flights. In 1990-91, 650,000 tonnes were moved by air, about half of this internationally.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
Victoria is the transport hub of south-east Australia acting as the national 
distribution centre for major manufacturing and retail chains. It is committed 
to making the best use of its national rail network (with excellent links to the port), its interstate and intrastate highways, its curfew-free airport and the largest port in the southern hemisphere, by developing further links to build a totally integrated transport hub. This involves 12 special national roads projects, interstate links, the City Link road project, ring roads planned, the Dock 
Link heavy duty road linking rail to the port, and upgrading of the airport. 
Support for the use of electronic commerce will assist the integration of these transport services.
<P>
The Port of Melbourne handles over one third (by value) of imports and exports.
Victoria loads significantly more cargo for sea export than it originates and 
gains more interstate trade, in both weight and value terms, for sea export.
<P>
<B><I>Prospects</B></I>
<P>
Opportunities exist in the transport and storage industry itself, and for 
industries dependent upon access to an effective transport service.
