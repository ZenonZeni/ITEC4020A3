GRIMMA TO UPGRADE UKRAINIAN SUGAR PLANTS

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Germany's MASCHINEN- UND ANLAGENBAU GRIMMA (MAG) said it was seeking a
DM100 million contract to modernise five sugar refineries in Ukraine.
Grimma is negotiating with various banks to arrange the necessary credits
to finance the work, but intends only to provide equipment and know-how
itself. Ukraine, like other countries in the Commonwealth of Independent
States, is struggling to revive its run-down industry and wean itself off
dependence on bartered sugar imports from Cuba.

SCOTTISH AND NEWCASTLE TAKES CONTROL OF SOUTH AFRICAN BREWER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

One of the largest brewing groups in Britain, SCOTTISH AND NEWCASTLE, has
bought a 75% stake in niche South African beer maker MITCHELL'S BREWERY
for an undisclosed amount. Mitchell's started operations in Kynsna on
South Africa's south coast in 1983, adding further small brewing
operations in Cape Town in 1989 and Johannesburg in 1991. The company
currently produces around 1,500 hectolitres of beer a month, giving it a
domestic market share of less than 1%. The South African market is
dominated by SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES which has a 97 % market share.

ESTONIAN BREWER SELLS STAKE TO FINNISH GROUP

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Estonian brewer TARTU OLLETEHAS, has agreed to sell 15% of its shares to
Finland's OLVI. The Estonian brewer said the deal would boost its exports
by means of Olvi's sales network and become the best brewer in the Baltic
states. Olvi is encroaching on a Baltic market which has so far been the
preserve of BALTIC BEVERAGE HOLDING, a joint venture between HARTWALL AND
PRIPPS RINGNES, owned by Norwegian food conglomerate ORKLA and VOLVO, of
Sweden. Olvi paid Nkr10 million for the shares. It also said it wanted to
put at least a quarter of its shares onto the burgeoning Tallinn stock
exchange. Tartu Olletehas had share capital of Nkr7.5 million and turnover
last year of Nkr175 million. The brewer is owned by MAGNUM KONSUMER, which
is also the main stakeholder in the TALLINN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, which
recently sold 10% of its shares to foreign investors. Both parties have
agreed that next year 25% of Tartu shares will be listed on the Tallinn
stock exchange.

FYFFES SELLS STAKE IN BANANA FIRM TO DOLE

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Irish fruit wholesaler and distributor FYFFES Plc has sold its 50%
shareholding in the BANANA TRADING CORPORATION to a wholly-owned
subsidiary of DOLE FOOD COMPANY Inc for a total consideration of USD26.3
million. Fyffes has also entered into new long-term shipping agreements
with Dole for shipping part of its banana requirements from Latin America.
Fyffes said the shipping agreements would be of benefit to Fyffes and Dole
and would give both companies significant economies of scale. Banana
Trading Corporation owns a Guatemalan banana farming business along with
other related assets including certain banana farming assets in Honduara.

LA MODERNA TO CLINCH DEAL WITH ROYAL VAN NAMEN

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Mexican conglomerate EMPRESAS LA MODERNA is close to a deal to buy Dutch
fresh produce distributor ROYAL VAN NAMEN. With annual sales of some USD50
million, Van Namen is one of Europe's largest produce distributors and
would add to La Moderna's growing network of distribution in the Americas.
Produce would be shipped to Europe from the Americas and vice-versa. La
Moderna grows and buys fresh produce from Chile to Canada. About 75% of
its production is currently sold in the United States and Canada. The
fragmented fresh produce market - with the largest player capturing only
7% of the market - is fertile ground for La Moderna to leverage its vast
distribution capabilities Demand in the US fresh produce market is
expected to grow more than 10% a year. A pure cigarette company just three
years ago, La Moderna has expanded into agri-biotechnology and packaging.
Its agri-biotechnology division consists of a fresh produce division and a
seeds company SEMINIS. The group's produce division exported USD250
million worth of vegetables last year. Moderna's produce company
BIONOVAJUST merged with Oakland-based DNA PLANT TECHNOLOGY to form DNAP
HOLDINGS.

BASS CRITICISED FOR HOOPERS HOOCH CAMPAIGN

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The advertising campaign launched by British brewer BASS to promote its
"Hoopers Hooch" low-alcohol fizzy drink has drawn criticism in
professional circles and from authorities worried about the temptation of
alcohol for young consumers. For similar reasons, Carlsberg Tetley was
recently forced to change the labelling on its "Tchickhead" brand and
Whitbread has been censured by Alcohol Concern for the implicit incitation
to violence and the anti-social behaviour that its "Lemon Jag" and
"Vanilla Heist" beers inspire amongst youngsters..

SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES ACQUIRES POLISH BEER MAKER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

SOUTH AFRICAN BREWERIES, together with EURO AGRO CENTRUM, has acquired 52%
of the capital of the Polish brewery group TYSKIE in Tychy. SAB, which has
made enormous strides on overseas markets since 1993, has thus moved up
into fourth place on the world brewers' league, with a total production
capacity of 38 million hectolitres, behind ANHEUSER BUSCH (107 million
hectolitres), HEINEKEN (64 million hectolitres.) and MILLER, a subsidiary
of the US Philip Morris group (54 million hectolitres). With the Tychy
brewery, as well as the Lech brewery in Poznan, in which they already had
a controlling stake, SAB and EAC now hold 20% of the Polish beer market.
Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, SAB is now the biggest brewery group in
Hungary and is set to become Romania's number one too. In the 1995/96 year
(ending March 31), SAB turned out 24.6 million hectolitres of beer in
South Africa and 11.4 million hectolitres abroad. SAB has just made a loan
issue on the international capital market for USD300 million, in order to
raise funds to reinforce its long-term strategy.

BONGRAIN REPORTS SLIGHT RISE IN TURNOVER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Back home in France, Bongrain has just published its latest half-yearly
results, which show a slight increase in sales turnover to 5.055 billion
French Francs, up from FF 4.935 billion at end-June 1995. Sales were badly
affected by poor weather conditions in June, but picked up sharply in
July, which will help lift second half 1996 figures. Bongrain's turnover
also progressed at international level.

The French group's operating profits, which in the first half of 1995 had
reached FF 312.2 million, fell back to FF 250.3 million, as a result of
several different factors. For a start, manufacturers have not been able
to offset the increase in the price of milk paid to producers in relation
to its cheese-making quality by a rise in retail prices from Autumn 1995
onwards. And at the same time, by-products and surpluses have lost a lot
of their value (-20% in the case of lactoserum, for example) - something
which accounted for nearly half the drop in operating profits.

Bongrain has meanwhile continued to invest in the main brand names and in
advertising at European and international level. The group has also
managed to reinforce its presence on new markets.

Bongrain's overall profit in the first half of this year works out at FF
148.1 million (FF 184 million in the previous six-monthly period), and net
group profits at FF 129.5 million compared with 164.6 million for the
first six months of 1995.

Although no forecasts were made for the year as a whole, Bongrain is
expecting a difficult year. The company is nonetheless pressing on with
its innovation strategy, with several major launches on the cards for its
subsidiaries.

BONGRAIN FINALISES ACCORD WITH MAJOR CZECH CHEESE MAKER

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

French food group BONGRAIN, which already has a foothold in the Czech
Republic via its PRIBINA subsidiary, is busy finalising an agreement to
take over the Povltavske Mlekarny cheese-making concern, to the South East
of Prague. The Czech firm, one of the biggest in the dairy sector,
produces soft cheese and fresh cheese, as well as other dairy products. It
has an annual turnover of more than 100 million French Francs and employs
275 people. Thanks to this latest transaction, Bongrain will become sole
owner of the Hermelin soft cheese brand sold by Pribina and Pvltavske
Mlekarny.

UNILEVER OPENS FIRST SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CENTRE IN CHINA

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The Anglo-Dutch agri-foods and consumer products group UNILEVER opened on
October 7 its first scientific research centre in China, which is to serve
as a starting point for a successful partnership between the food industry
and academia in the country. Set up in Shanghai's Institute of organic
chemicals, the new research centre will help Unilever to draw on the
strength of the local Chinese scientific world and, at the same time,
steer the locals towards developing the most suitable technologies. The
research centre will use its scientific know-how to help match consumer
preferences with Unilever's branded products as a means of boosting sales
in China, and particularly the business of the twelve joint ventures the
Anglo-Dutch group already has in the country.

VRANKEN GROUP BUYS HEIDSIECK CHAMPAGNE FROM SEAGRAM

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Canadian drinks group SEAGRAM announced on October 14 that it had signed a
deal to sell its famous champagne Heidsieck Monopole to Vranken. The
sell-off covers not only the brand name, but also the business premises
and stocks - some 4.5 million bottles or more than three years of sales -
and roughly 130 hectares of vineyards. Heidsieck Monopole's 70-strong
workforce will also be taken on by the Vranken group and no redundancies
are foreseen. The price tag on the transaction was not revealed, but it is
estimated in professional circles to be in excess of USD400 million.
Paul-Francois Vranken, a Belgian businessman who set foot in the Champagne
region just 20 years ago, has become, through successive acquisitions and
launches of new brands like Charles Lafitte and La Demoiselle, the fifth
biggest champagne trader, producing some 8.5 million bottles in 1995 and
with a sales turnover of more than 600 million French Francs. Until
recently, Mr Vranken was still short of a big brand name - a gap that he
will now try to fill by relaunching the Heidsieck Monopole.

To start with, he launched the Charles Lafitte and La Demoiselle brands of
champagne. Then, in 1994, he brought his company into a new phase of
external growth by taking over the Barancourt house which has a sales
turnover of more than two million bottles of champagne a year, and then
through the acquisition of Champagnes Charbaut (with sales of 1.2 million
bottles). These acquisitions enabled the Vranken group to sell more than
8.5 million bottles of champagne this year and post a turnover of nearly
FF 700 million.

Last year, Heidsieck Monopole sold 1.2 million bottles of champagne,
three-quarters if which were intended for the export market. From
Seagram's point of view, this transaction is a follow-up to the
restructuring plan its champagne branch launched last Spring.

DANISH GROUP BUYS PFIZER'S CHY-MAX DAIRY CLOTTING AGENT RANGE

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The Danish group CHR. HANSEN has strengthened its position as market
leader in the field of dairy clotting agents by acquiring from PFIZER of
the United States the CHY-MAX range, along with all patents and related
rights. A production contract has just been signed with the American
company, which will continue to manufacture the CHY-MAX range of clotting
agents at its Indiana factory in the US. Last year, the CHY-MAX product
range's worldwide turnover was nearly USUSD14 million, according to a
communique, which did not, however, reveal the price tag on the
transaction with HANSEN. CHY-MAX is a range of dairy clotting agents
produced via fermentation and used in cheese-making. Chr. Hansen already
owned a similar range of products called CHYMOGEN. The Danish company,
better known as a major supplier of food ingredients, is a subsidiary of
Chr. Hansen Holding A/S, a firm specialised in biotechnology applications
for food ingredients, anti-allergy treatment and for technological
services for agriculture. The holding company has a workforce of about
2,000 in 30 different countries, and, for the 1994/1995 financial year,
reported a turnover of 1.8 billion Danish Kroner.

DANONE TAKES CONTROLLING STAKE IN CHINESE BREWER, DONGXIBU

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

French agri-foods group DANONE has strengthened its foothold in the
rapidly-growing Chinese beer market, by taking a 60% stake in the WUHAN
DONGXIHU BEER COMPANY, the fifth biggest brewer in China. Thanks to this
acquisition, the French group has moved up to fourth place on the Chinese
beer market, according to Danone, although it did not reveal the price tag
on its latest investment. The Chinese market, which is now as big as 160
million hectolitres of beer, is still very fragmented. Dongxinu is fifth
in the league table, with a production figure of 2.9 million hectolitres
of beer a year. Situated in Wuhan, in the Hubei province (in central
China), Dongxihu holds 40% of the market in the province, which is home to
60 million people.

Last January, Danone had announced plans for a joint venture with Haomen,
the tenth biggest beer maker in China, based in the Beijing region. China
itself has the second largest market for beer in the world, behind the
United States. And the market is expanding rapidly. It is set to cross the
200 million hectolitre mark by the year 2000, making it the biggest market
in the world.

Last year, the Danone group turned out 25 million hectolitres of beer
(Kronenbourg). It is the leading brewer in France, Italy and Spain and the
second biggest in Europe. In China, Danone is also present on the market
for biscuits, fresh dairy products (Danone brand), Chinese milk-based
drinks (Wahaha) and sauces (Amoy).

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The December 1994 Directive on packaging and packaging waste sets
ambitious targets for recovery and states that recycling and re-use must
contribute an important part of recovery. Recycling of plastics can give
rise to concern about the migration of contaminants from the recycled
plastic into a packaged food. One component of a research project
currently being carried out in the United Kingdom under the EU-sponsored
Agriculture and Agro-Industry R&D programme (AAIR) is studying the
effectiveness of a virgin layer of plastic (PET) (polyethylene
terephthalate) in limiting the migration of chemicals from recycled PET,
i.e. three-layer plastic bottles (for soft drinks) were made with a buried
layer of either virgin PET or PET contaminated deliberately with
chemicals, and migration levels were measured in parts per million (ppm).

The results of research work undertaken so far show that even with a high
level of deliberate contamination of the middle layer of the 3-layer
bottles, with hightly mobile model contaminants, migration was not
detectable after the standard conditions of 10 days at 40 degrees C or 
even after 6 months at room temperature.

This has brought the research workers to the conclusion that an intact PET
layer represents an efficient functional barrier against migration from
contaminants encapsulated in a recycled PET material under normal
conditions of use for soft drinks. The results also allow the conclusion
that the 25% recycled material employed in this test could be increased to
any technically feasible percentage provided that the characteristics of
the functional barrier layer remained unchanged.

BIOTECHNOLOGY: NEW MEANS OF BOOSTING WHEAT PRODUCTION

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The use of modern biotechnology processes is the best way of raising world
production of wheat and meeting growing demand for this staple food,
concludes a study published on October 18 by the International Centre for
the Improvement of Wheat and Maize. The Mexico-based research centre
employs scientists from some 40 different countries, including two giant
wheat and corn producer nations - the United States and France.

Thanks to biotechnology, more wheat can be harvested from the same surface
area using the same amount of water for irrigation and the same quantity
of fertilizers; it can also help keep the impact on the environment to a
minimum, pointed out Matt Reynolds, the main author of the study. Other
means of boosting production - expanding the sown surface area or wider
use of fertilizers - are not viable in the long term, argues the
scientist. "We can use biotechnology to identify the genetic
characteristics of adaptation and resistance to insects and diseases",
said Mr Reynolds, adding that the size of the grains and the taste of
wheat were equally important.

The development of a new prototype wheat crop and the idea of leaving the
ears to develop over a longer period of time are among the other solutions
suggested by the study to the problem of meeting rising world demand for
cereals. The Mexican research centre's study also recommends the use of
"hybrid" crops, which are more hardy and resistant to disease, insects and
parasites than older generations of crops, even though they are not fit
for reproduction. The authors of the study point out that a possible
stagnation of wheat yields would further aggravate the problems of poverty
and famine in the world, since wheat is "the staple food of humanity".
"While the world population is growing at a rate of 2.5% a year, wheat
yields are increasing by only 1% a year", pointed out Timothy Reeves,
Director of the International Centre for the Improvement of Wheat and
Maize.

RESEARCH PATENTS: NEW EUROPEAN PATENT SEARCH SERVICE WILL HELP AVOID
DUPLICATION

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

For the last few months, European scientists have been able to draw on a
new European patent search service called QUICK SCAN, which the European
Commission would like to promote among a wider user base. It is targeting
small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, because this new service
- one of the various support measures offered under the Community's
specific programme for the dissemination and exploitation of the results
of research and technological development activities (INNOVATION) - can
help avoid duplication of research effort and unnecessary expense on
investment.

According to the European Commission's estimates, up to ECU 25 billion is
wasted every year in the EU in duplicating research and development work
already carried out elsewhere. This problem is of particular relevance to
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which are less likely to have
access to the patent information system (a study carried out by the
European Patent Office last year showed that over 60% of European SMEs do
not have access to the system). In this context, the aim of the QUICK SCAN
activity is two-fold: it not only helps avoid duplication of research and
thus promote more efficient use of funding resources, but it can also
raise awareness of the patent information system.

The Commission has sought to keep the methodology of the new service as
simple as possible. It falls under the "Technology Validation and
Technology Transfer" action line of the INNOVATION programme and projects
are subjected to a "novelty check" by the search division of the European
Patent Office (EPO). This check compares the technical developments
proposed by the project with the existing state-of-the-art in that
particular area thus enabling a well-informed evaluation of the innovative
character of the proposal.

During the months of April and May 1996, no less than 100 project
proposals selected for the definition phase under the INNOVATION programme
were submitted for assessment. 13% of these were not suitable for scanning
by the EPO for reasons of either form or content. Following the scan, 30%
of all projects submitted were classified as being "novel". In 57% of
cases, however, the novelty of the project, or parts of it, was questioned.

In at least two cases, the QUICK SCAN search results led to a complete
redirection of the project due to the discovery of information on existing
research not known to the consortium carrying out the research project. In
a few other cases, QUICK SCAN provided valuable information on possible
competitors, pointed towards interesting prior R&D work or possible end
users of a new technology.

In the eyes of the European Commission, this first exercise has clearly
demonstrated the cost effectiveness of the QUICK SCAN activity. Generally
speaking, it estimates that the costs of the scan itself amounted to only
one-tenth of the funding that has been directly saved as a result of the
scan.

FRENCH RESEARCHERS MAP COFFEE GENOME

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Researchers at the ORSTOM Institute in Montpellier have succeeded in
mapping the coffee genome, break-through that is expected to improve plant
selection. Launched at the beginning of the 1990s, research into the gene
structure of coffee was carried out by the Laboratory for genetic
resources and the improvement of tropical plants (LRGAPT) attached to
ORSTOM (the French Institute of scientific research for development and
cooperation) in collaboration with the Nestle research centre in Tours.

The map was drawn up through the molecular analysis of plant material
provided by researchers at the Man coffee genetics station in the Ivory
Coast, where several thousand varieties collected across Africa have been
nurtured and studied for almost thirty years. The map is of Coffea
canephora, more commonly known as the Robusta variety, which is grown in
West Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. It may, however,
also be used for other varieties, notably the more widespread Arabica.

Using molecular markers, it is possible with a genetic map to identify and
locate the genes carried by the chromosomes, enabling scientists to
identify genes of agronomic interest at an early stage of development:
disease resistance, yield, bean size, caffeine content, etc. The map will
make the selection of coffee plants more rapid and effective. It has until
now taken ten years to assess the potential of new strains. Moreover,
selection has traditionally been a very expensive process, because of the
large areas needed for trials and the array of tests to assess the quality
of a coffee variety. In the longer term, the map may be used in
genetically modifying coffee plants. LRGATP researchers will soon apply
their map in the context of a programme in Kenya to control the transfer
of a diseases resistance gene identified in Robusta to the Arabica
variety. Joint projects have also been launched in the Ivory Coast and
Costa Rica.

COSMETICS: EU COMMISSION GUARANTEES SAFETY OF RAW MATERIALS USED

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The safety of cosmetics and their ingredients in the European Union is
subject to strict regulation. The conditions in which cosmetic products
can be marketed without posing any risk for consumers are lid down by EU
Council Directive 76/768/EEC - the so-called Cosmetics Directive - which
has been amended on several occasions, pointed out EU Consumer Policy
Commissioner Emma Bonino in response to a written question from German
Green Member of the European Parliament Hiltrud Breyer. Worried about the
"mad cow disease" scare in the United Kingdom, the MEP was asking if
cosmetics users ran any risk of infection through broken skin, and, more
particularly, if the UK still used beef derivatives as raw materials in
cosmetic and was taking the same safety precautions as in Germany and
other EU Member States.

Permanently reinforced safety standards.

In reply to the German MEP's first query, Mrs Bonino simply said that the
Commission's services had no knowledge of any study that had assessed the
risk of infection through the use of cosmetics on a cut or broken skin
surface.

As for any risks related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the
Commissioner recalled that Council Directive 93/35/EEC amending the
Cosmetics Directive for the sixth time, had tightened up safety standards
for cosmetic products. This Directive requires cosmetics manufacturers or
importers in the European Union to provide the national authorities, or
monitoring purposes, with an information file, giving data notably on the
qualitative and quantitative aspects of the product, as well as the
physical, chemical and microbiological specifications of both the raw
materials used and the finished product, purity criteria and conditions
for microbiological control of cosmetic products, the method of
production, and an evaluation of the safety of the end product from the
human health point of view.

As for the risks posed by BSE, the Commissioner recalled that, at the
beginning of the 1990s, the World Health Organisation and various national
and EU scientific and veterinary committees concerned by the mad cow
scare, including the EU Scientific Committee for Cosmetics, recommended
that manufacturers used only beef derivatives from countries free from
bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The European cosmetic toiletry and
perfumery association (Colipa) has made quite clear that it has
scrupulously followed the experts' recommendations.

Thus specified beef offal supplied to cosmetics producers must be
accompanied by a certificate of origin. Colipa also confirmed earlier this
year that beef cattle offal most likely to pose a risk of contamination,
such as brain, spinal cord and eyes were "not used in the manufacture of
cosmetic products in the Community".

At the EU level, legislation adopted since the early days of the BSE
epidemic has been largely of a veterinary nature. After the British
Government admitted there was a potential risk of BSE transmission to
humans last Spring, the European Commission imposed a blanket ban on UK
exports of beef, beef products and derivatives. Directive 96/239/EC of
March 27, 1996 prohibited British exports of any products originating from
cattle slaughtered in the UK intended for medical, cosmetic or
pharmaceutical use. Decision 96/362/EC of June 11, 1996 stipulates that
the UK may only allow production of such products in plants under official
veterinary control which have proved that they respect the necessary
conditions. This measure states that rules governing products from the UK
also apply to production of medicines, cosmetics etc. for the domestic
market. But with this piece of legislation, the Commission also gave the
go-ahead for a partial lifting of the embargo on gelatine and tallow. The
embargo is being relaxed gradually, insofar as strict conditions laid down
by law are respected. For its part, the United Kingdom has taken a whole
host of measures since 1988, including steps to keep specified beef offal
off the market.

Tallow is mainly used for making soaps. Among the other beef extracts that
can be used in the manufacture of cosmetic products, some, such as
gelatine, are taken from various cattle tissue (bones, skin etc.) and are
used in different types of products (shampoo, soap, hair care products).
Other derivatives are extracted from specific organs such as the placenta
or the thymus and are only used for making a very limited range of
cosmetic products. The Commission nonetheless recalled that:

- beef derivatives are not used in cosmetics in their natural state, but
first have to undergo various chemical treatments;

- in most cases, raw materials of animal origin only account for a very
small percentage of the make-up of the end cosmetic product.

Under the sixth amendment to Directive 93/35/EEC, the list of ingredients
that may be incorporated into cosmetics has to be given on the label of
the product. In the case of beef derivatives, listed in a
recently-published inventory of ingredients used in the manufacture of
cosmetics, the organ from which they are obtained will also be mentioned
if it is a clearly-defined organ such as the placenta or spleen.

BIOMEDECINE: YEW TREE YIELDS CANCER-FIGHTING PRODUCT

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

An Italian company based in Milan, Indena, has developed a new medicine
that can used to treat cancer - taxol - which is made from raw materials
derived from the yew tree. The raw materials are supplied by Bioagrico, a
company based in Beert-Pepingen in Belgium, which prunes and trims yew
trees (Taxus baccata) free of charge, recovers the leaves and branches and
packs them up for delivery to Italy where they are processed.

The yew tree, a conifer that is easily pruned, is well known in the
European countryside. It can also be deadly if just a few score or hundred
grammes are ingested. Horses and sheep are particularly at risk (they can
die only a few hours after eating just 200 grammes of yew tree leaves).
The yew tree's pine needles and berries are also highly toxic.

The basic substance used for making taxol is baccatin, a substance
extracted from yew tree pine needles and which can be used in treatments
against several different types of cancer. Some twenty years ago, it was
extracted from the bark, but this endangered the survival of the trees
themselves. The substance can also be extracted from pruning or clipping
waste. In Belgium, Bioagrico has been awarded a contract to supply yew
tree clippings up to the year 2007, unless in the meantime another, more
effective substance is found to combat cancer. Currently, Bioagrico prunes
yew trees owned by 4,200 private citizens, with each cropping bringing in
about 50 kilogrammes. In season, several teams are busy working at the
same time on private yew trees, while gardeners may also send their
cuttings to Bioagrico. The "harvest" is then dried before being dispatched
to Italy. The Belgium-based company prunes yew trees in all regions of the
country and is seeking to expand its expertise to other Member States of
the European Union.

PYRETHRINS: EU PROJECT SEEKS TO RE-CONQUER NATURAL INSECTICIDE MARKET

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

A non-food research project seeking to improve and develop cultivation of
pyrethrins (natural insecticides) in Mediterranean Europe has just
received the backing of the European Commission. Bringing together
agronomists, chemists and biologists from various Member States of the
European Union, this project is being coordinated by the French firm
Sanofi Chimie and will benefit from EU financial assistance to the tune of
ECU 1.231 million for three years. Known in Europe since antiquity, but
abandoned for the last few decades, pyrethrin growing could allow the
cultivation of up to 5,000 hectares of poor and arid soil in southern
Europe, thanks to this research project.

Australian offensive.

Natural pyrethrins were the first insecticides used by man. Known from
time immemorial, cultivation of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefoium, from which
they are extracted developed in Europe from the Middle Ages onwards and
were widely used until the appearance of the first synthetic insecticides
in the middle of the 20th century. Today, because of their total
harmlessness to man and domestic animals as well as their excellent
biodegradability, they remain the reference point as active materials in
the field of domestic use, body hygiene (anti-lice products), animal
health (for keeping insects out of livestock farm buildings) and
biological agriculture, etc... All these are fields where the consumer and
EU regulations encourage the use of "clean", rather than synthetic,
insecticides, preferably of "natural" origin.

Although use of natural pyrethrins is still significant and even
expanding, cultivation of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium historically
deserted Europe after the Second World War, shifting to Africa on a wide
scale (notably Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania). Today, these African
cultivations are threatened either because of the political instability of
the region, or because of inadequate productivity. An important market is
thus up for grabs. Europe, for its part, although a high user of these
natural insecticides (with 20% of the world market) is at the moment
lagging behind, for it is the Australians who are taking over from the
Africans and developing vast areas of mechanised cultivation in Tasmania.

If improved varieties similar to or better than those being grown in
Australia - and adapted, as in Tasmania to intensive, mechanised
cultivation - can be developed, a whole new market could no doubt be
re-conquered by European farmers, by growing a high added value crop that
is perfectly suited to fallow land and poor and arid land too.

The research project that has just got off the ground has the following
main aims:

- to study the action of natural pyrethrins, an especially the comparative
activity of the various active principles identified in the plant, as well
as the possibilities of biological synergies;

- to implement a genetic selection process designed to obtain varieties
with maximum active principle content

- to develop an optimised cultivation technique which is economically
adapted to European farms, notably through mechanisation.

More specifically, the project involves crop improvement work (evaluation
of germ plasma in the field, study of yield factors of the leaves,
isolation of different isomers, modes and sites of action of the different
isomers among insects), techniques such as interpolating cultivation and
hybridation, diseases, crop maintenance, climatisation and field
transfers, harvesting etc. and studies into the extraction/purification
process.

FARM PRODUCT PROMOTION: COMMISSION PLEASED WITH COMPANY POLICY

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Food product promotion campaigns sponsored or run by the European Union
have taken on much greater importance in recent years and have even
qualified to have their own unit within the European Commission in
Brussels Unveiling at the Paris food show in early October the promotion
campaign for grape juice contracted out to Sopexa (a French company for
promoting sales of farm and food products), Sergio Ventura, who runs the
Agricultural Product Promotion Unit of the Commission's
Directorate-General for Agriculture (DG VI), recalled that there had
originally been no general legal base for promotional measures financed by
the EU. However, some specific sectors had their own legal base allowing
EU-sponsored promotion campaigns for a few products like milk, textile
fibres, olive oil, etc.). Later on, the necessary legal foundations were
gradually laid to enable the use of Community funds for promoting other
products. And, from 1991 onwards, a specific division was created to
manage all the product promotion schemes. With the recent reorganisation
of DG VI's structure, the existence of the Promotion Unit has injected a
bit more coherence into this field of marketing.

Grape juice consumption boosted by 70%.

His trip to Paris gave Mr Ventura the chance to explain to Sopexa's
managers that there is still a wide variety of promotional actions,
ranging from direct actions 100% managed by the European Commission, which
puts out calls for tender via specialised public relations agencies, to
actions delegated to the Member States themselves. Even in this latter
case, the Commission is still responsible for ensuring the follow-up from
the conception stage to follow-on operations, including the choice of
agencies proposing to organise the promotional measures. And some are 100%
financed by the European Union, while other actions involve joint
participation in the costs by associations or producer groups benefiting
from the promotion campaigns.

Mr Ventura illustrated his explanation with the long-running grape juice
promotion campaign as an example. Launched in 1986 at a meagre cost of
only ECU 4.6 million to the farm budget of the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fun (EAGGF), the campaign has helped boost sales of
grape juice in France, Germany and Spain (Belgium and Italy had originally
taken part, but have since dropped out). In the case of France (which
accounts for 50% of EU production of grape juice), for example, the EU
funds are channelled through the national interprofessional wine office
Onivins, which in turn gives Sopexa a budget of eleven million French
Francs. The advantages of promoting consumption of grape juice are of
course linked to the high costs of intervention and distillation in the
table wine sector. Grape juice is also sold on a highly competitive
market, dominated traditionally by citrus fruit juices, but it has
benefited from the strong growth of the fruit juice market worldwide.

In terms of product image, the overall impact of the advertising and
promotional actions carried out in France over the last ten years has been
quite clear: grape juice has come to be seen in the eyes of consumers as a
more modern, more original and party-type drink, according to a market
research study undertaken last year. Moreover, grape juice could count on
the support of nutritionists, just as wine could draw on the support of
the medical world for the famous "French paradox" (namely that regular,
but moderate, consumption of wine can help avoid cardio-vascular
illnesses).

The numbers show very positive results too, points out the Commission. For
instance, consumption of grape juice in France has risen by nearly 70% in
the space of ten years, with household purchases rising from 220,000
hectolitres to 374,000 hl in 1995. On a fruit juice market which, last
year, began to see a slow-down in its growth rate (+11%), sales of grape
juice continued to expand strongly, both in volume terms (+16%) and in
value (+15%). This expansion was evident in all the main regions of
France: sales progressed in the West, the South East and the Paris region,
which all had previously recorded below-average consumption of grape
juice, while the North remained well above average. And two and a half
million more homes have been converted to grape juice since 1987 - an
increase of 60% in ten years (+12% for 1995 alone).

BEER: GREEN PAPER ON EXCLUSIVE PURCHASING AGREEMENTS IMMINENT

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

Already a year late, the European Commission is expected to publish a
Green Paper on selective distribution and exclusive purchasing agreements
in the beer sector - authorised since 1967 under an exemption to Community
competition rules - but probably not until the end of this year or the
beginning of next. EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert is
considering extending until 1999 block exemption Regulations based on
Article 85.3 of the EU Treaty for beer sector agreements. The Commission
said on October 16 that the proposal was to avoid a "legal vacuum" that
may occur if the block exemptions from EU competition rules were to expire
before the consultations on the Commission's Green Paper for their
replacement had been concluded. Requested by Member of the European
Parliament David Thomas (PES, UK) to comment on consultations with beer
producers and distributors, the Commission indicated that no formal
meetings had as yet taken place.

The first derogation to the general ban on agreements laid down by the
Treaty of Rome dates back to 1967 (Regulation 1967/67). This regime was
extended for 15 years in 1983 by virtue of two separate block exemption
Regulations, one covering selective distributions (1983/83), the other
exclusive purchasing (1984/83). The latter text, general in scope,
required more specific provisions for particular sectors, including
brewing, and notably the British beer industry, where the breweries hold
beer-supply contacts with pubs owned by them. The Regulations now cover
tens of thousands of agreements by which a supplier, on the one hand,
appoints a reseller as his exclusive distributor in a given area
(Regulation 1983/83), and on the other hand, a reseller agrees to buy all
his products from one supplier only (Regulation 1984/83).

At the time of their adoption, the Commission was acting on the assumption
that exclusive purchasing contracts in this sector required a major
investment by the supplier and a long-term commitment by the seller and
therefore justified exclusive contracts. The Commission therefore decided
to make special allowances for beer-sector agreements. The maximum length
of an exclusive contract was set at five years for beer and other drinks
and from five to ten years for beer exclusively. Specific clauses covered
situations where the supplier and seller had also signed a lease for
points of sale. It was agreed that the length of the purchasing contract
could correspond to that of the lease, even if the latter was for a period
of more than ten years.

The British way of life.

Under pressure from the breweries, British MEPs have visited Brussels to
ask Mr Van Miert for an extension of the exemptions for a minimum of 15
years. An EU source said the Commissioner was not unsympathetic to the
legal uncertainty for breweries caused by the possible review of the
exemptions, and that he had also understood the "tied tenancy" pub-supply
agreements were "part of the British way of life". The Commissioner has
also been lobbied hard by British all-party MEPs who are strongly in
support of an extension to the exemptions. One solution which may be put
forward in the Green Paper would be to carry on with sectorial block
exemptions. Another would be to base exemptions on the market share of the
company operating the restrictive agreements. In the meantime, when Mr Van
Miert makes a formal proposal for the extension of the rules, his decision
must be approved by the full team of Commissioners.

Threat to "real ale"?

Meanwhile, a meeting in Brussels on October 11 between Commission
officials and the European brewers' lobby group, the Confederation des
Brasseurs du Marche Commun, failed to make much progress towards solving a
dispute over tied tenancy rules allowing pubs tied to national brewers to
sell a beer from another, i.e. foreign, brewer only if it has been
produced by traditional "real ale"-making methods. The Commission is
worried that this discriminates against beer imported from other EU
countries, where beer is rarely cask-conditioned. But the UK is now
threatening to drop the "guest beer" provision altogether if it is forced
under Community law to include continental European lagers in the
definition of a "guest beer".

SPIRITS: RUSSIAN AND CHILEAN "PROTECTIONISM" CRITICISED

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

New Russian plans to limit vodka and ethyl alcohol imports from the
beginning of 1997 have sent a tremor through Brussels. The hangover from
the measures announced by Moscow could mean a serious drop in EU sales in
1997 - 50 million litres instead of the 200 million litres exported in
1995. EU officials thought they were seeing double when they learnt of
these new Russian plans, since negotiations were in theory still under way
on current limits on vodka imports following Commissioner van den Broek's
trip to Russia in March. There is no justification for introducing new
unilateral safeguard measures, the Commission said on October 9. The
threat to outlets in Russia is not the only thing worrying EU spirits
producers, who are still voicing loud complaints about discriminatory
taxes applied to alcoholic drinks in Chile.

Russian unilateralism.

Negotiations on a possible ceiling for EU (and Belgian, in particular)
exports of vodka to Russia started back in March following a visit by EU
External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek. Following the Russian
announcement of import restrictions, the Commission said that, until it
had received more information, consultations would continue between EU and
Russian negotiators in the framework of the Interim trade Agreement
between the two sides, which came into force on February 1, 1996. The
Commission reckons that imports of ethyl alcohol in 1995 and 1996 did not
harm Russian domestic interests at all and thus there was no justification
for the unilateral introduction of safeguard measures. Besides, protective
measures of this kind go against the letter and the spirit of the Interim
Agreement. Brussels has now asked the Russian authorities to continue
consultations on the issue and - pending their outcome - to suspend the
safeguard measures.

This is not the first time the EU has had to remind the Russians of their
obligations under the Interim Agreement. Under a unilateral trade rule
imposed by the Russian authorities on March 13, EU exporters of vodka were
required to sell into Russia at a minimum price of USD8.2 per litre,
putting them at an obvious competitive disadvantage to vodka exporters in
the Commonwealth of Independent States, who are subject to a minimum price
of USD3.8 per litre. The new rule not only hit EU vodka suppliers and
their estimated ECU 200 million trade with Russia; it also dealt another
blow to EU confidence in the reliability of the Russian signatures on the
trade pact with the EU.

In 1994, the EU Member States exported ECU 266 million worth of alcoholic
drinks to Russia (including ECU 167 million worth of vodka). This figure
was almost reached in the first eight months of 1995, when EU sales of
alcohol to Russia were worth ECU 240 million (including 150 million
generated from vodka sales).

Discriminatory Chilean taxes.

Having seen their long-running campaign against Japan's alcohol taxes
vindicated in the World Trade Organisation, European spirit producers are
now turning their attention to Chile's taxes which, they say, discriminate
against foreign spirit imports. The Confederation of European Spirits
Producers (CEPS) welcomed the recent decision by the WTO's Appellate Body
to uphold an earlier ruling by the Dispute Settlement Body, that Japan's
tax regime discriminated against foreign imports. But CEPS President
Christian Delclaux warned on October 8 that similar rules were being
planned in Chile. "Given the WTO ruling, we are amazed at reports that the
Chilean administration is now proposing to submit GATT-inconsistent
legislation to the Congress", he said.

Mr Delclaux says although the new proposals address Chile's current
discrimination, they would still maintain differences in taxes.
"Maintaining such a wide variation in the levels of taxation is
discriminatory - and the WTO has just affirmed this fact", he pointed out.
"If Chile believes this is an acceptable solution, it is sadly mistaken.
Indeed, I am certain that if producers and exporters of Chilean wines were
treated in a similar discriminatory manner in, for example, the United
Kingdom - their second largest export market - they would feel likewise."

Chile - and, to a certain extent, South Korea - the alcohol tax regime
bears remarkable similarities to that of Japan. Under current Chilean law,
whisky is taxed at a rate of 70% ad valorem at wholesale. Other spirits
are taxed at 30%, while pisco, the country's top selling local brew, is
taxed at 25%. Mr Delclaux says that the current differentials should be
removed by applying a uniform tax rate, based on alcohol content, for all
spirits.

EU producers set out trade objectives

European spirits producers have meanwhile welcomed EU External Relations
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan's support for their tariff and other
objectives for the WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore in December and
the subsequent work programme. Much of what the European spirits industry
is seeking is very close to the Commissioner's own thinking for Singapore
and the WTO's work in coming years, according to the CEPS. Sir Leon has
also said the Commission will continue to work closely with the industry
to promote the shared objective of improving market access for European
exporters throughout the world. "Given that the value of EU spirits
exports to markets outside Europe totals nearly 4,000 million ECU, the
Commissioner's personal endorsement of our WTO objectives, especially
improved market access for distilled spirits in world markets, is most
welcome", said CEPS President Christian Delclaux on October 17.

CEPS is urging the Commission to help secure at the Singapore Ministerial
"substantial reductions" in the import tariffs applied to distilled
spirits beyond those agreed in the Uruguay Round in 1994. This includes
expansion of the 'zero for zero' import tariff phasing-out arrangements
for brown spirits, e.g. Cognac and Scotch Whisky (agreed by the EU,
Canada, Japan and the United States) to encompass all spirits and liqueurs
and extension of the arrangements to other WTO signatories.

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

The European Commission has signed a contract for a study of the
food-products market in Korea with a French company, Sofres S.A. and its
subsidiary in Seoul. Of the thirteen firms that offered their services in
reply to the Commission's call for tenders, the Directorate-General for
External Relations (Commercial Policy and Relations with North America,
the Far East, Australia and New Zealand, Unit China, Korea, Hong Kong,
Macau, Taiwan) selected the French firm on the basis of a number of
criteria such as the fee proposed for the study, professional
qualifications and experience of the personnel, the number of people
working on the market study etc. Sofres S.A. will receive ECU 125,345
(excluding travel and subsistence expenses) for carrying out the market
study covering a number of sectors of the food products market in the
Republic of Korea.

EXTRACTION SOLVENTS: COMMISSION PROPOSED TO UPDATE 1988 DIRECTIVE

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

To take account of scientific and technical progress, the European
Commission is proposing to amend for the third time Directive 88/344/EEC
on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on extraction
solvents used in the production of foodstuffs and food ingredients. The
proposed changes concern mainly the use of certain solvents, their
conditions of use and maximum residue limits in food. The European
Parliament has just given its stamp of approval to the proposal during its
October 23 plenary session in Strasbourg.

According to the draft Directive, the Annex to Directive 88/344/EEC would
be amended as follows:

In Part I, the substance butyl acetate is deleted (as it is no longer used
in agri-industry).

In Part II:

The entry for hexane is modified.

In Part III, the substance methyl-propanol-1 is deleted and in its place
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is added with a maximum residue limit of 0.02
mg/kg in the foodstuff due to the use of extraction solvents in the
preparation of flavourings from natural flavouring materials.

The Member States must amend their laws, regulations and administrative
provisions so as to authorise trade in products complying with this
Directive by July 1, 1997 at the latest, and must ban trade in products
not complying with this Directive from January 1, 1998 onwards.

INWARD PROCESSING: COOPERATIVES OPPOSE EU COMMISSION PROPOSAL

from AGRI-INDUSTRY EUROPE, 25 October 1996, No. 29

French agricultural cooperatives - whether involved in upstream farm
production or downstream in the agri-food processing industry - are up in
arms about a draft proposal from the European Commission that seeks to
amend arrangements for access to international trade. The cooperatives are
particularly critical of the proposed changes to the inward processing
regime which attracts a wide range of agricultural products. The draft has
also been given a cautious welcome by European agri-food industry
specialists. But there may be room for improvement as, according to some
sources, it appears that the future rules for the system of inward
processing traffic have not yet been finalised within the Commission's
Directorate-General XXI (Customs and Indirect Taxation).

The inward processing regime is a system that enables goods to be imported
into EU customs territory for processing - without having to pay customs
duties. The only condition required of these goods is that they are
immediately re-exported outside the EU after processing, other wise they
will be liable for normal customs duties. In their position paper, the
French farm cooperatives, who are supported in their quest by cooperatives
in other EU Member States, reckon that this system cannot provide an
adequate response to the new, liberal regime ushered in by the GATT
Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture and can only be regarded as an
exceptional regime.

Widening its scope, say the cooperatives, would "not be compatible with
global respect for  Community preference". Not can it provide an
alternative to the traditional, unsatisfactory, policy of export
restitutions.

They also feel the Commission's draft proposal will risk encouraging
production of agricultural raw materials to move elsewhere: since the
"substitutability" of foodstuffs cannot rely solely on volume and price
equivalents. The farmers say what is needed is a "material yield"
equivalent, enabling a qualitative differentiation to be made on the basis
of raw material accounting. The processing stage between import and export
of a food product must be visible through the use of two different customs
tariffs, one on the way in and one on the way out. The French cooperatives
reckon that the proposed reform goes against the policy guidelines
requested by the farming industry itself.

The European Commission's draft proposal assumes that the GATT Agreement
on Agriculture has restored world market prices for agricultural products
to normal. But this hypothesis, according to the cooperatives, needs to be
given more in-depth consideration because there is still considerable
speculation son markets that are supposed to be better governed nowadays.
To sum up, the French farm cooperatives really want to see a simpler,
clearer and less expensive system. Above all, they cite the principle of
acceleration and greater transparency of the system, the need for faster
clearance of the backlog of requests for licences and recourse to
computerised means of transmission.
