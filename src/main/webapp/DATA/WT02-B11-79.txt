<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   The federal government and Sao Paulo state have
agreed on a bailout plan for troubled bank Banespa,  removing a two-year-old
monkey from Cardoso's back. Meanwhile, the central bank has approved loan
guarantees from the treasury to help refinance state debts, thus extending help
to state banks as well as private ones covered under the Proer rescue program. 
&#167;  Cardoso has turned to new export incentives to bolster the real against
growing devaluation demands from the right.  Page 2</P>
<P><B>CHILE</B>   &#167;   A severe drought has hit the hydroelectric
generation and agricultural sectors hard, dragging the stock market and pension
fund returns south.  &#167;  Unwieldy regulations and cautious investors have
delayed PanAmerican highway improvements.  Page 3</P>
<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   The central bank expects inflation to hold steady
in 1997 so will only slightly increase the rate  at which the peso may
depreciate against the dollar. Union officials, however, are asking for minimum
wage hikes far above the bank's 18% inflation estimate.  <B>&#167; </B> Coffee
growers are protesting the peso's strength, which they say has cost them $2.6
billion over five years.  &#167;  To avoid any appearance of impropriety in
awarding a $92 million computer contract, officials are stepping carefully
around a James Bond-style intrigue.  Page 4</P>
<P><B>ECUADOR</B>  &#167;   Bucaram unveiled a sucre-dollar convertibility
modeled after Argentina's, but whether he can stay  a steady policy course is
another matter. Between now and April, congress will debate convertibility and a
balanced budget requirement among some 60 points of his far-reaching
modernization program, including , tax, political, labor and banking reform.

<P><B>MEXICO</B>  &#167;   Distancing himself from a series of
politically-sensitive snafus as he tries to salvage his own political  standing,
Zedillo replaced controversial attorney general Lozano with a non-partisan

military spending and impunity in human rights.  Page 7</P>

<H1>Environmental Projects Report</H1>
<H1>Blooming Market for Environmental Projects: Oasis or Mirage?</H1>
<P>Latin America's backlog of pollution problems and strong pressures to build
a green future are placing environmental projects alongside telecommunications
and power on national agendas. The growing list of potential projects ranges
from cleaning polluted waterways and contaminated mines to installing massive
sanitation systems and writing environmental legislation. With the World Bank
forecasting market growth of 12% annually &#150; $12 billion a year for water
and sewerage alone &#150; the many US environmental firms see a rare chance to
globalize. But many obstacles stand in their way.</P>
<P>A growing market, for example, does not mean an easy market. Environmental
law and implementation vary widely, meaning firms have to acquaint themselves
with the letter of local law as well as the spirit. Furthermore, some markets
are dominated by competitive foreign firms, especially European water companies.
Of equal importance, US firms often misjudge the challenge of financing emerging
markets infrastructure, says Don Deieso, president and CEO of Metcalf &amp;
Eddy, one of the country's oldest environmental firms. &quot;Many folks in our
industry rush to these opportunities without asking the fundamental question:
Are they financeable?&quot; </P>
<P><B>Clean Up Pressures.</B> Firms willing to deal with the complexities are
assured of a market growing in response to a variety of pressures. The issue of
clean water, air and land has come to a head for Latin American governments,
driven by national &quot;green&quot; movements, commitments for sustainable
development under various conventions, including the December 1994 Summit of the
Americas, and environmental standards under free trade agreements, such as
NAFTA. Moreover, before getting involved in projects, multilateral agencies and
private institutions are screening them for environmental impact. At large
corporations, it is the policy to impose worldwide standards on international
operations, sometimes as a precaution against future changes in the law.
Furthermore, companies that follow an environmental ethic are keen to see
penalties for polluters, in part because their practices confer a cost
advantage. </P>
<P><B>Finding Financing. </B>Water projects, which are fast becoming a leading
area in Latin America's environ mental market, share a challenge common to other
infrastructure in Latin America: the need to raise long- term financing that
will be repaid by fees collected. To attract private capital, risks have to be
mitigated. User fees must reflect the true cost of service, and fee-setting
rules must be transparent to ensure predictable income and insulation from
politics. </P>
<P><B>Working With Cities. </B>Creditworthiness of the offtakers, often
municipalities buying the service, is another potential risk. One solution is
being pioneered in the city of Bogota. With Chase Manhattan Bank as advisor, the
city is structuring a BOT project with the winning bidder, the French water
company Degrement, a subsidiary and partner of Lyonnais des Eaux, to allow other
municipal revenues to be pledged in the event of nonpayment. In a similar
solution, the Mexican government is extending revolving lines of credit through
the state-owned public works bank Banobras for sponsors to draw on if the
municipality defaults.  </P>
<P><B>Beware Of Shifting Rules.</B> When doing business in Latin America, US
environmental companies often find themselves at the beginning of the learning
curve. Financing is one challenge, but they also need to look out for
environmental and commercial laws that are backed up by the local authorities.
Industry spokesman Deieso cites two instances where companies were forced to
accept rate reductions despite having signed contracts that they thought gave
them ironclad protection.</P>
<P><B>Ways To Find Help. </B>Through new industry organizations such as the
Environmental Export Council and the Environmental Technologies Trade Advisory
Committee, small US companies may find support in breaking into Latin America's
high-growth markets. Deieso advises them to work through the large engineer ing
and construction companies. &quot;It is a very expensive market to do on your
own. You can go to bankruptcy in a New York minute.&quot; He also recommends
local con struction and engineering firms for their high quality and as
essential partners in any venture.</P>
<P><B>Where's The Work?</B> To identify opportunities, multiple leads have to
be followed. Entities including the US Agency for International Development
(USAID) and ExIm Bank have started departments to help companies find, win and
fund environmental jobs. Government projects &#150; the bulk of opportunities &#150;
are made public through a bidding process, and the World Bank or the
Inter-American Development Bank will have a stake in any big project. Indeed, a
glance at the accompanying chart reveals the huge and expensive projects these
institutions are lining up. Typically, these projects involve dozens of smaller
contracts. Private sector projects are much tougher to identify and, experts
say, a local presence is essential.</P>
<P><B>Market Momentum. </B>Also active on behalf of firms is the Commerce
Department's Office of Environmental Technologies Exports (OETE), which opened
in 1994. It has listed 250 opportunities in Latin America, includ ing 96 in
municipal water treatment, 49 in consulting and 34 in industrial wastewater
treatment. The most promising markets for such goods and services, according to
Kristine Bretl, the Latin American specialist at the OETE, are Brazil, Mexico,
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.</P>
<P>Based on World Bank estimates, says Bretl, <B>Argentina</B> must invest $13
billion to meet water supply and wastewater treatment targets for the year 2000.
<B>Brazil</B> must invest over $19 billion in environmental technol ogies over
the next 10 years. However, Brazil is a harder market to crack than is
Argentina, where Lyonnais des Eaux projects in Buenos Aires and Santa Fe have
produced a positive track record for private involvement. Bretl notes that &quot;85%
of Brazil's market is supplied by domestic firms,&quot; but says &quot;significant
opportunities exist, especially as more municipal privatizations occur.&quot; 
One new opportunity is in Sao Paulo state, whose sanitation company (SABESP)
allows subcontracting.</P>
<P>After the 1994 peso devaluation stalled developments in<B> Mexico</B>, the
country's environmental technologies market reached $1.5 billion in 1995 and
will grow 8- 14% annually for the next three years. US companies can expect
their share of this market to grow to as much as 85% by 1998. In <B>Chile</B>,
water privatization opportunities are &quot;just around the bend&quot; pending
legislation to privatize regional water companies, with estimated combined
assets of $44 million. Given the Chileans' general preference for US products,
as well as the ease of doing business in that country, Bretl says the Chilean
market presents one of the best opportunities for US environmental technology
exports.</P>
