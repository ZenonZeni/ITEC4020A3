<P>
The focus of research in the G K Williams CRC for Extractive Metallurgy is on the high temperature extraction and refining of metals. The centre was established in 1991 and operates on two sites approximately 20 kilometres apart at the University of Melbourne and at the Clayton site of the CSIRO Division of Minerals.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Research is carried out within two program areas. The Process Chemistry program is concerned with the high-temperature chemistry associated with the processing of minerals through to refined metals and with the unique molten phases produced during smelting and refining processes - slags, mattes and alloys.
The Process Engineering program concentrates on injection of powders and gases into molten phases, the handling and flow characteristics of molten products and heat transfer in high-temperature reactors.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
A number of research successes are being transferred to industry including:
<UL>
<LI>A flow control valve for molten material.
<LI>Design and application of a novel cooling element for high-temperature furnaces.
<LI>Selection of slag composition and operating conditions for a number of smelting and refining processes for optimum operation based on thermodynamic modelling and high-temperature measurements.
<LI>A novel process for carbothermic smelting of aluminium has been developed.
<LI>A process for recovering sulphur from sulphur dioxide-bearing bases has been developed which uses wastes from mining as reagents.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The extractive metallurgical industry is process-oriented and research is usually applied by making incremental changes to a small number of large, capital-intensive processes.
Transfer of this knowledge takes place through a range of activities, the most important being publication of results, patenting of novel process developments, identification of potential commercialising partners, plant trials to demonstrate concepts, company presentations on-site, movement of higher degree students and post-doctoral fellows into Australian companies, and consulting activities by staff of the centre.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Many mining companies have their head offices in Melbourne, making the city an ideal location for the transfer of research to industry. The centre brought together the two leading pyrometallurgical research groups in Australia, which are both located in Melbourne.
 There are also three corporate metallurgical laboratories in Victoria.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The centre trains postgraduates and postdoctoral personnel in research techniques, research planning and research management in extractive metallurgy, and contributes to the continuing development of practising metallurgists by providing specialist short-courses, symposiums and workshops. Major international conferences are organised in strategically important areas of extractive metallurgy.
<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The centre can assist metallurgical companies and their suppliers find solutions to their pyrometallurgical problems through collaborative and contract research and consulting activities. It can also provide expert advice and training programs.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Funding to the centre comes through the Australian Government's CRC Program ($1.9 million per annum) and the Australian metallurgical industry ($730,000 in 1994-95). Further grant money is obtained through the Australian Research Council.
