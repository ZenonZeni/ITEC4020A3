<B>Background Information on MNR's Red Tape Changes
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources has proposed changes to reduce Red Tape in forestry and forest fire legislation, the Conservation Authorities Act, the Public Lands Act, the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act, provincial park legislation and surveying legislation.<P>

Many of the changes will improve the delivery of government services; others update aspects of legislation, consolidate a number of Acts into simpler, more-focused legislation and remove unnecessary regulation.  In some cases, MNR used Red Tape changes as an opportunity to improve government by strengthening fines and the ability to control activities related to natural resources management.  The changes will also create new opportunities for business and industry involved in resource management activities.<P>

MNR will maintain its ability to manage natural resources sustainably.  This fact sheet outlines the intent of the changes to various pieces of legislation.<B><P><BR>


Crown Forest Sustainability Act (CFSA):</B><P>
MNR will add a clause to the CFSA to resolve tax issues between the forest industry in Ontario and the federal government.  The change will clarify that funds dedicated by the forest industry to the provincial Forest Renewal Trust Fund are Crown assets for forest renewal.  This amendment protects forest renewal funds by clarifying that funds dedicated by the forest industry to the provincial Forest Renewal Trust Fund are Crown assets for forest renewal.  This will avoid the risk of these funds being subject to taxation.<P>

All the money in the renewal trust fund will be available for forest renewal.  This is consistent with the original intent of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act.<P><BR>

<B>Forestry legislation:</B><P>
MNR will reduce the number of Acts related to forestry to 5 from 11.  MNR will consolidate key elements of five Acts into a proposed new Forestry Act which will:<P>
<UL>
<LI>incorporate parts of the Woodlands Improvement Act (WIA) covering MNR's commitment to assisting forestry on private land.  MNR will repeal the WIA
<LI>include parts of the Trees Act that authorize municipal governments to enact bylaws that cover what can be done with trees in a municipality.  MNR will repeal the Trees Act
<LI>increase fines for improper cutting of trees to help protect important forest resources on private land and increase other fines
<LI>include parts of the Forest Tree Pest Control Act to provide authority for dealing with serious insect infestations on Crown or private land.  MNR will repeal the Pest Control Act
</UL><P>

MNR will also repeal the Spruce Pulpwood Exportation Act and the Settler's Pulpwood Protection Act because the CFSA covers these Acts and will repeal the Forestry Workers Employment Act because current labor legislation addresses this Act.<P><BR>

<B>Forest Fires Prevention Act:</B><P>
Changes remove Red Tape from declaring Restricted Fires Zones during serious periods of forest fires.  Restricted Fire Zones are a tool MNR uses to help protect public safety during forest fire emergencies.<P><BR>

<B>Public Lands Act:</B><P>
Changes clarify MNR's ability to conduct land use planning.  The ministry will improve its land use planning process, set clear rules for appropriate, environmentally sensitive development and give industries working on Crown land more certainty about making business decisions.<P>

Other changes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>shorten the time to sell a piece of Crown land larger than five hectares making the time frame consistent with the treatment of small lots
<LI>simplify the sale of waterlots under the Act
<LI>simplify the process for transferring administrative control of public land to other provincial ministries, to Crown agencies or to the federal government
<LI>establish the province's ability to remove conditions on patents that restrict the right of landowners to develop natural resources on their land
<LI>allow MNR to develop management agreements to use public land with government and non-government organizations
<LI>simplify the setting of fees for using public land
</UL><P><BR>

<B>Ontario Parks legislation:</B><P>
Changes increase the maximum fine for damaging park natural and cultural heritage and other offences to $25,000, from $5,000, consistent with fines by other agencies.<P>
Other changes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>allow MNR to enforce clean-up and repair orders
<LI>define the authority of Park Wardens
<LI>simplify and consolidate regulations covering activities in parks
</UL><P><BR>


<B>Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act:</B><P>
Some changes emphasize public safety and increase the level of fines.<P>Other changes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>streamline the approval process for construction and repair of dams
<LI>add the ability to issue a stop-work order consistent with protecting public health and safety and with protecting natural resources
<LI>allow the development of management agreements
<LI>repeal sections of the Act that relate to log drives (using lakes and rivers to move timber), because the activity has not been undertaken for years
<LI>use the municipal tax system to collect debts from private landowners to reimburse MNR for work it does to deal with unsafe structures around water that pose a public risk

</UL><P><BR>


<B>Conservation Authorities (CA) Act:</B><P>
Changes will follow up on the province's earlier introduction of changes that clearly identify flood control and protection of provincially significant conservation lands as the provincial interest in CA matters.<P>
The latest changes:<P>
<UL>
<LI>will clarify the CA role in hazard management consistent with the provincial interest in provincial policy statements.
<LI>will revise regulations on fill and construction to focus on important wetlands, shorelines and other natural hazard areas
<LI>will streamline approval of CA regulations
<LI>will provide municipalities in a CA watershed with at least 30 days notice of proposed budgets and levies
<LI>will remove the province from involvement in CA business that is not related to the provincial interest.  This includes grouping municipalities for appointment of members to a CA, enlarging a CA, amalgamating CAs, and a number of housekeeping changes.
</UL><P><BR>


<B>Surveying legislation:</B><P>
Complementary changes to the Surveys Act and the Surveyors Act will transfer the responsibility for developing standards for monumentation to the self-governing Association of Ontario Land Surveyors, whose members have the expertise and experience to administer these standards.  Any proposals made by the association require government approval before implementation.  Monumentation refers to physical reference points placed during the surveying of land.<P><BR>

<B>Mining Act:</B><P>
Changes will allow for the consolidation of three regulations covering the disposition of Crown-owned oil and gas into one regulation.<P><BR>

<B>Public Review of MNR's proposed red tape changes:</B><P>
MNR will post all its proposed Red Tape amendments on the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) registry for 45 days for public review and comment.  The names of people to contact are included with each posted amendment.  MNR will consider comments it receives before finalizing proposed amendments.
