<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>"ARMED" FOR HEALTH</CENTER></H3>

You can boost aerobic intensity by increasing the arm movements you make at or
above shoulder level. Arm movements make your heart pump blood against the force of
gravity.
<P>
        Overweight people may have to work harder to get a good aerobic workout in a
swimming pool, since their extra body fat lets them float more easily.

Bicycle riding is a wonderful form of exercise, and for most, the results are
completely beneficial. But a small percentage of men who ride long distances and/or
ride very often experience sexual problems that can be traced to their bicycle's hard
seat. The normal bicycle seat is pointed, putting pressure at the base of the penis.
This constant pressure on that area can result in loss of sensitivity to the penis
and even temporary impotence. The solution: a split bicycle seat that has one side
for the right buttock and one side for the left.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>SUBDUE PMS - WITH YOUR FEET!</CENTER></H3>

<P>
In the first study of its kind, reflexology has shown clear effectiveness against
premenstrual syndrome. Reflexology involves manual manipulation of key reflex points
- especially nerve endings in your feet, which correspond to specific body parts and
systems. (See pages 108-109 in Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide for more
detailed information on reflexology.)

<BR>
MONTH REFLEXOLOGY PROGRAM HAD
<BR>
46-PERCENT MILDER PMS
<BR>
SYMPTOMS THAN WOMEN GIVEN
<BR>
PLACEBO REFLEXOLOGY.</CENTER></H3>

<P>Los Angeles researchers found that women who underwent a two-month reflexology
program had 46-percent milder PMS symptoms than women given placebo reflexology The
reason this works may be because reflexology helps to normalize the adrenal hormones
released during stress. These hormones are known to increase in the premenstrual
period.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>QUIT YOUR BELLY-ACHIN'
</CENTER></H3>
<P>
        If you have persistent stomach pain, please see your physician.  Meanwhile, there
are a few immediate measures that may help. Avoid pepper, caffeinated beverages
(easier said than done if you are a coffee-drinker), and alcohol. These substances
may stimulate acid secretion.  In addition, you shouldn't smoke (another tough habit
to break). Finally, don't use aspirin or medications containing it because aspirin
irritates the stomach.

        Liquid acidophilus is a marvelous stomach-ache reliever Take one tablespoon at
first sign of distress. If discomfort persists, take a second tablespoon in half an
hour Chances are you won't need a third dose!

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>CUSTOM-DESIGNED ICE PACK
</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Fill a re-sealable plastic bag with two cups of water and one-third cup of rubbing
alcohol. Close tightly and put in the freezer. The liquid stays slushy and the ice
pack will mold to any part of the body. Have on hand when you need an ice pack to
relieve an ache or a bruise.

<P>You don't have to choose between gray hair and cancer-causing chemicals. Check
your health food store for these hair dyes made from vegetable and plant sources:
Permanent dye - Herbatint, 4 oz for $12.50; Semi-permanent dye - Vegetal, 4 oz for
$15.99. If not available in your health store, call Bioforce of America at
1-800-445-8802.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>SKIN BRUSHING
<BR>
FOR OVERALL HEALTH</CENTER></H3>

<P>Unlike other organs, your skin can be noninvasively accessed and, by a variety of
therapeutic techniques including skin-brushing, act to rejuvenate inner organs. 
Skin-brushing is particularly therapeutic and can impact your body's entire
functional spectrum.
<P>
        Variations of skin-brushing have been practiced for thousands of years. The Greek
athletes used specialized spoon-like skin scrapers. Cherokee Indians used dried corn
cobs; Comanches used sand from Texas river bottoms. You can buy an Inexpensive loofa
sponge at most health stores and do as the Japanese did before their traditional hot
bath.
