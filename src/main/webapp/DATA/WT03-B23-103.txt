</ul><hr><B><A NAME="commentary">COMMENTARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS <B><!--COMMENTARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS--></B></A></B> <P>
<B>The following section provides a commentary and recommendations on numerous issues raised in the course of this report. It also raises some other issues of concern in other areas of policing and makes recommendations specific to these areas as well.</B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr1">1. <I><B>The Role of the Police and The Media: </B></I><B><!--1. --></B></A></B> <P>
<I><B>The Role of the Police and The Media: </B></I> <P>
<B>The relationship between the police and the media while understandably close under certain circumstances can lead to a reliance by journalists on police as their source of information. It is common practice for the police media unit to selectively release details about crimes which support police claims of a &quot;crime problem&quot;. </B> <P>
<B>It is most important that the use of police resources be used wisely, efficiently and in a non-discriminatory manner. Not to do so may lead to claims of the police manipulating &quot;moral panics&quot; and the abuse of current police powers. The role of an impartial, independent and well resourced Bureau of Crime Statistics is most important if truly effective crime prevention strategies are to be developed and implemented. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation: </B> <P>
<B>That the Crime Statistics Unit currently housed within the Department of Justice (the same Department covering the Police) be disbanded</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation :</B> <P>
<B>The &quot;independent&quot; Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research be re-established in Victoria. That its workings be overseen by an independent board. That every attempt be made to de-politicise the selective gathering and presentation of statistics. </B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr2">2. Independent Community Visitors Scheme<B><!--2. IndependentCommunity Visitors Scheme--></B></A></B> <P>
<B>The descriptive data presented in this report supports the experience of Community Legal Centres in identifying that the largest number of complaints about mistreatment by police relate to events that take place in police stations. Despite the long term existence of Police complaints mechanisms it is of considerable concern that no local initiatives have been implemented to address the need for a preventative independent accountability mechanism for the operation of police stations.</B> <P>
<B>The development of an independent community visitors scheme with powers to randomly visit police stations, to protect the rights of individuals in custody is urgent. The establishment of independent community visitors schemes covering all police stations in Victoria is in the interests of the police, members of the public taken into police custody, and the Victorian community in general. An added benefit of such an approach if properly implemented is that of making the police directly accountable to the community that they are serving. Such measures have already been implemented in some parts of England. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That a community visitors scheme with powers to randomly visit police stations be implemented throughout Victoria. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation :</B> <P>
<B>That community visitors have the right to unimpeded freedom of movement throughout the police station and the legislative capacity to formally report activities, circumstances and recommendations to the responsible authorities for further investigation and action. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation :</B> <P>
<B>That it be a criminal offence for police to obstruct a community visitor in the course of their duties.</B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr3">3. Strip Searches And Photographs<B><!--3. Strip SearchesAnd Photographs--></B></A></B> <P>
<B>In contrast to the existing controls over police powers regarding fingerprints and blood samples, (which up until May 1993) have been under some limited independent accountability through the Magistrates' Courts, there has been no legislative protection introduced in relation to strip searches, internal body searches, frisktype searches, or the taking of photographs of individuals being investigated by the police. </B> <P>
<B>Fundamental issues of accountability and legislative protection are absent in relation to the most basic of all human rights, namely the protection and dignity of our bodies. The experience of Community Legal Centres and Community Groups supported by this reports findings identify numerous issues which require urgent legislative action. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation :</B> <P>
<B>Unless life is at risk body searches and strip searches should be banned. Under most circumstances prior to police initiating a strip search or body search Police should be required to seek the consent of a Magistrate and if the body search is to occur that it only occur with the assistance of a Medical Practitioner. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation :</B> <P>
<B>It should be a criminal offence for strip searches to be conducted by members of the opposite sex. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation :</B> <P>
<B>That a register be established and an independent monitoring mechanism be established to oversight the use of strip searches and their proper and improper use by police.</B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr4">4. Development Of Local Police Accountability <B><!--4. DevelopmentOf Local Police Accountability --></B></A> </B> <P>
<B>Legal Centres believe that the Victorian Police Force has progressively become more isolated and alienated from its local communities. The very nature of a very large, highly mobile and transient force is undoubtably an important factor leading to this two way split. </B> <P>
<B>Attempts at community police liaison and developments such as police community consultative committees (P.C.C.C.) have generally not been successful often because of the perception of local communities, which view these developments as police controlled public relations exercises rather than genuine attempts to develop accountability and dialogue with local communities. These local committees have never possessed any real decision making powers, and on occasions have been subject to directions higher in the police force quashing local community initiatives aimed at developing local accountability. </B> <P>
<B>There can be no substitute for the development of real dialogue and accountability of police to their local communities. What is needed is local management committees with real powers to direct the use of police resources available to their community, including the prioritising of police work in the prevention and detection of crime within that community.</B> <P>
<B>Clearly appropriate guidelines need to be established for the operation of community management structures for police. Much work needs to be done to ensure that these management committees are appropriately resourced. These committees should be provided with guidelines, developed in consultation with the community, that balance the need to protect individuals rights from unnecessary interference and arrest, against the need of the community to implement effective crime prevention and an adequate response when crime does occur.</B> <P>
<B>As of the present time no government in Victoria has yet addressed the widening gap between police and local communities. The future safety of our community requires a move away from police officers barricaded from the community by roller doors, high security fences, and motor vehicle windows two thirds closed. These images tell the community that the police do no trust the community and therefore are not to be trusted themselves.</B> <P>
<B>The development of local community management structures must not be left in the hands of the police force, but rather with the appropriate input from bodies such as the Law Reform Committees, Ethnic Communities, Womens Groups, Youth Organisations and local government to name a few of the obvious participants.</B> <P>
<B>More police, with more powers and more community alienating equipment is not the solution. More can be done with less in the area of Policing, what is really needed is a different style for achieving outcomes. </B> <P>
<B>What is required in Victoria is a radical rethink of the direction in which our police force is going and the way in which our police are held accountable to local communities.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation: </B> <P>
<B>That the role and function of PCCC's be independently evaluated and monitored.</B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr5">5. Complaints Against Police: <B><!--5. Complaints AgainstPolice: --></B></A></B> <P>
<B>Under the current system the great majority of the complaints about police are in fact investigated not by the Internal Investigations Department nor the Deputy Ombudsman but by police from the same district which the officer complained about comes from. Community sentiment about the continued investigation of Caesar by Caesar could at best be described as cynical. At worst, this system of complaint procedures could be viewed with complete disrespect and loss of faith in the law and the Victoria Police Force. </B> <P>
<B>Whilst the task of this report was not to collect data on police investigation of complaints, it is worth noting that the experience of Community Legal Centres indicates that often police investigate those for whom they have a direct line of responsibility. Such a system undermines any confidence or faith an individual may have particularly if they have been strip searched, beaten, confined and subsequently threatened with reprisals if they complained about their treatment. If the growing loss of legitimacy of the Victoria Police is to at all be abated this most fundamental issue of police accountability must be addressed.</B> <P>
<B>The Victoria Police Force has long been criticised for the manner in which complaints have been handled by the force. A 1971 review by an English inspector indicated that there were no systematic records of complaints and that local police had significant powers in determining whether complaints were officially recorded and sent to police headquarters.(Goldsmith 1991 p22). The Beach Inquiry into allegations against members of the Victoria Police from 1976-78 found that little had changed. More recently an internal review in 1987 also criticised police response to people wishing to make complaints.(Richardson, J. 1987) and Melbourne <U>Age</U> journalists found in 1989 that in a survey of suburban police stations &quot;very few police officers approached indicated any familiarity with complaint recording procedures&quot;. (Goldsmith 1991 p22) This suggests the need for a thorough and systematic review of police complaints in Victoria.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That the Government implement a review of Police accountability in Victoria. It is almost 20 years since any major review of police malpractice has occurred and given the dramatic increase in complaints it is time to review police complaints and police accountability in Victoria.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>It is imperative that a broad based, impartial, independent and well resourced Police Complaints mechanism be established. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That in examining the type of structure to be established, due and proper consultation occur with the community. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>Such a structure should have powers to refer criminal charges to the Department of Public Prosecutions and to impose other disciplinary sanctions against police officers. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>Such a structure should have a clear Government mandate to make recommendations on police procedure and practices, recruitment and training policies. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That Representatives from the Federation of Community Legal Centres and the Chief Commissioner of Police meet at regular briefing sessions to exchange information on various aspects of policing in Victoria. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That a formal mechanism be put in place for the reporting by the judiciary of instances of police malpractice which have been identified in courts.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That formal mechanisms be introduced to allow victims of police mistreatment to be kept fully informed of the progress of their complaint to the authorities.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:<!--Recommendation:--></B> <P>
<B>That the Ombudsman immediately investigate ways of addressing the low substantiation rates of current police complaints, particularly allegations of assault and harassment.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That the process for dealing with proven cases of mistreatment be open to public scrutiny and input as these are community matters. </B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr6">6. Exercise Of Police Powers</A></B> <P>
<B>The extensive powers given to the Victoria Police represent a substantial privilege that has been bestowed upon them by the rest of the community.</B> <P>
<B>There are no systematic accountability procedures in place to ensure that these privileges are properly exercised and no measures to counter the actual or perceived institutionalised abuse of powers which may have developed within the Victoria Police. </B> <P>
<B>Legislation granting rights to people in police custody provides no penalties against police officers who abuse those rights and no other mechanism is available to effectively complain.</B> <P>
<B>There are no penalties imposed on police officers in relation to the denial of rights given to members of the community. This basic level of accountability is exactly what police are demanding for other members of the community who breach the law and fundamental human rights. There is an urgent need for regular independent audits of the exercise of all Victorian police powers, in particular powers relating to the following:</B> <P>
<B>6.1 <I>Granting and Refusal of Bail </I><!--6.1 --></B> <P>
<I><B>Granting and Refusal of Bail </B></I> <P>
<B>Far too many people are being placed on bail unnecessarily in relation to summary offences. Police also have extensive powers to oppose the granting of bail to people charged with offences. </B> <P>
<B>6.2 <I>The Taking of Fingerprints </I><!--6.2 --></B> <P>
<I><B>The Taking of Fingerprints </B></I> <P>
<B>Since the introduction of the Crimes (Fingerprinting) Act 1988, police have taken more sets of prints from suspects annually than prior to the implementation of the Act. The State Government is currently proposing to widen police powers to take fingerprints, by allowing police to take fingerprints from anyone over the age of 15 suspected of committing any offence no matter how minor the offence be it an indictable or summary offence. This results in the courts having a reduced role or no role at all to play in monitoring the exercise of police power in relation to such people who refuse to give their fingerprints. Furthermore, police will be able to use reasonable force against such people who refuse to give their fingerprints.</B> <P>
<B>The result of these proposed increases in police powers further reduces police accountability which is currently afforded to citizens through the appeal of fingerprinting requests to the Magistrates Court. Considerable concern is expressed in regards to the more than likely increased abuse of Community members interacting with the police, whilst at the same time these proposed changes will have no impact on crime prevention and solution. </B> <P>
<B>6.3 <I>Requesting Name and Address</I><!--6.3 --></B> <P>
<I><B>Requesting Name and Address</B></I> <P>
<B>The State Government is currently proposing legislation to make it an offence for people to refuse to give their name and address to police who believe on reasonable grounds that they may have committed (or about to commit) an offence. This unnecessary offence will result in more people being taken into police custody, thus causing a likely increase in police mistreatment against those people in custody. In South Australia where police have such a power, 20% of people charged with failing to give a name and address on demand were only charged with that offence. </B> <P>
<B>6.4 <I>Search Warrants</I><!--6.4 --></B> <P>
<I><B>Search Warrants</B></I> <P>
<B>Search warrants are issued far too easily, and in some circumstances members of the public complain of being presented with unsigned search warrants or warrants authorising searches of premises other than the one the police wish to search.</B> <P>
<B>6.5 <I>The taking of blood and other body samples </I><!--6.5 --></B> <P>
<I><B>The taking of blood and other body samples </B></I> <P>
<B>Although body samples are not often taken, and are subject to some independent scrutiny of the Magistrates' Court, an ongoing audit and assessment of the use of this power is also necessary in the interest of an efficient and accountable police force and for the protection of all citizens. </B> <P>
<B>Of particular concern is that the State Government is currently proposing that the class of body samples include such things as pubic hair, anal swabs, genital swabs, breast swabs, saliva, mouth scrapings, dental impressions, and finger and toe-nail matter. The notion that police will be able to use reasonable force to take such samples, once they have a court order, is abhorrent, and clearly open to abuse.</B> <P>
<B>The potential for the type of abuse which currently occurs through police strip searching women suspects, and to extend this to the taking of intrusive body samples is an issue of major concern. </B> <P>
<B>6.6 <I>Preliminary breath testing</I><!--6.6 --></B> <P>
<I><B>Preliminary breath testing</B></I> <P>
<B>Although a reasonably well accepted procedure by the community, a careful audit of this power needs to be undertaken on a regular basis, particularly in relation to charges of refusal to take a breath test, where there are allegations of abuse by the police. </B> <P>
<B>6.7 <I>Questioning &amp; Police Custody</I><!--6.7 --></B> <P>
<I><B>Questioning &amp; Police Custody</B></I> <P>
<B>The length of time which people are detained in police custody for the purposes of questioning should be strictly monitored to ensure that the most basic of individual rights, i.e. not to be unnecessarily detained, is protected. Special attention must be given to situations where people are held in police detention for questioning and either no charges, or charges for offences against the police officers, namely hindering, resisting arrest, and assaulting police are laid.</B> <P>
<B>6.8 <I>Legal Representation</I><!--6.8 --></B> <P>
<I><B>Legal Representation </B></I> <P>
<B>Although provision is made in the <U><I>Crimes Act</I></U>for an individual's right to contact a legal representative the provision of legal advice by a solicitor when arrested must be made mandatory, as is the case in other democratic societies. Currently if police act in accordance to the law a suspect will be permitted to telephone a lawyer. Such a right is only of use to those persons who have twentyfour hour access to a legal representative. There is an urgent need for a twentyfour hour legal service available to all persons held in police custody. This mandatory right should apply irrespective of age, race, background or severity of charge.  </B> <P>
<B>6.9 <I>The provision of interpreters</I><!--6.9 --></B> <P>
<I><B>The provision of interpreters</B></I> <P>
<B>There is no proper accountability required of police in relation to the provision of interpreters for people from a non English speaking background who do not have a sufficient command of English. Studies in the area have shown that police are very reluctant to use interpreters, and the only accountability applied to police is if the Record of Interview is challenged in a later court proceeding. </B> <P>
<B>There are no adequate records kept indicating the adequacy of police use of interpreters, and no clear guidelines requiring the police to make use of interpreters. </B> <P>
<B>6.9.1 <I>Independent Third persons</I><!--6.9.1 --></B> <P>
<I><B>Independent Third persons</B></I> <P>
<B>The use of Independent Third Persons in situations where the person in custody for questioning and investigation is under the age of 17, or has an intellectual or mental impairment, also requires proper accountability to be developed to ensure that police comply with the legal requirements in this area. The situation in relation to people with intellectual or mental impairments needs to be given legislative protection. Proper guidelines need to be developed for police to guide them in the exercise of this power, and to monitor the implementation of the power.</B> <P>
<B>6.9.2 <I>Truncheons and handcuffs </I><!--6.9.2 --></B> <P>
<I><B>Truncheons and handcuffs </B></I> <P>
<B>There are no adequate accountability procedures in relation to the use by the Victoria Police of various items of equipment carried by them as a matter of course. Police must be held accountable for the use of handcuffs, truncheons and other items used for detention or forceful arrest or entry. These items have been provided to our police force as part of the responsibility and privilege accorded to police officers because of their unique role in society. </B> <P>
<B>The failure of successive governments to address accountability of the police use of these items has allowed an attitude to develop in the police force that police will not be held accountable for the use of these items no matter how inappropriately they might be used. </B> <P>
<B>To be unreasonably or improperly detained in handcuffs or beaten by police batons is a criminal offence regardless of whether the person carrying out the action is or is not a police officer. Police must be made accountable to ensure that this equipment is only used when necessary and required by the situation.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That the State Government withdraw its proposed legislation to increase police powers with respect to taking fingerprints, body-samples and demanding names and addresses from suspects. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>Section 464C of the Crimes Act should be amended to make it a criminal offence for a police officer to deny a suspect the right to communicate with a friend, relative or legal practitioner. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>Section 464D of the Crimes Act should be amended to make it a criminal offence for a police officer to fail to get an &quot;independent third person&quot; when required.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That a police powers monitoring authority be established to independently monitor and review the use and abuse of existing police powers.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That if victim impact statements are to be used in Victoria they should also be used in Police mistreatment cases.</B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr7">7. Gun Control &amp; Police Firearms </A></B> <P>
<B>It is of crucial importance for the community and government to ensure that police officers do not endanger themselves or the community by frequent and unnecessary resort to firearms.</B> <P>
<B>In the two years between 1987 and 1989 Victoria Police shot and killed eleven citizens. In ten out of these eleven shootings the police were not themselves being shot at. In at least seven out of the eleven shootings the deceased either did not have a gun or did not have a gun capable of firing. Four of those shot and killed were shot in the back, three dying of bullet wounds to the back of the head. Due to the number of shootings and their controversial circumstances the Coroner has conducted a lengthy investigation into seven of them. As of May 1993 the findings are still being awaited. </B> <P>
<B>The accidental firing of guns by police or deliberate discharge of guns in circumstances that endanger the public are events which occur with alarming regularity. Beyond the total removal of guns from all police and the total banning of their use in the community it is imperative that the use and abuse of firearms by police be more closely scrutinised and that improved training and procedures for handling and intervention be implemented. </B> <P>
<B>Survey respondents made a number of allegations of police using their firearms to abuse members of the public. Weapons are not toys, their abuse must be sanctioned. </B> <P>
<B>The community should not accept anything less than a least restrictive force approach from its &quot;guardians&quot;. Any policy which purports to address the issue of public safety and gun control must address the way that 10,000 armed police use their firearms. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That the Government in consultation with Police and the Community undertake a major review of Police Gun policy.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>Victoria Police adopt a &quot;least restrictive force&quot; policy and that part of this policy focus on measures to eliminate the use of firearms. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>Police Officers who are still in their probationary period of training be banned from carrying guns for the period of their probation.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That the right to refuse to carry weapons by police officers be more actively promoted and the right to carry arms should be limited to certain areas of police activity</B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr8">8. Specialist Squads<B><!--8. Specialist Squads --></B></A></B> <P>
<B>At various times there is considerable concern regarding the operations of specialist squads such as the Major Crime squad (now disbanded), the Armed Robbery squad, the Asian squad, and the Special Operations group.</B> <P>
<B>There exists a strong need to review the existence of these squads and for the implementation of effective and strict accountability of any specialist squads that are considered necessary.</B> <P>
<B>These specialist squads have been and are still able to act in a total void of accountability to the outside community and to the Parliament of Victoria. The nature of complaints about the operations of these squads indicate that even the most senior levels of police management have very little control over the operations of these sections of the police force. </B> <P>
<B>It is the clear impression of legal centres, based on complaints made to us that these squads have become a law unto themselves. </B> <P>
<B>Community Legal Centres have seen too many people whose treatment at the hands of these squads can best be described as torture. The methods used by these squads are of far greater danger to the community than most of the people against whom they direct their ruthless tactics.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That Specialist Police Squads be disbanded. Failing this preferred option to disband, regular independent judicial reviews of the activities of these remaining squads should occur. These reviews should call for public comment and findings be made public.</B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr9">9. Police Training<B><!--9. Police Training--> </B></A></B> <P>
<B>Whilst police in Victoria have made substantial gains in pay and other benefits over the last decade very little work has been done to ensure that they receive adequate training in relation to dealing with young people, dealing with people from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and the development of more sophisticated and less confrontational tactics when dealing with the public. </B> <P>
<B>The 19 week training course currently provided to Victorian police while objective in many of its educational aims can be considered to be grossly inadequate in others. Despite significant increases in budgetary allocations over the past 10 years, it would appear that the Victoria Police have not chosen to give as high a priority to training as is required.</B> <P>
<B>Recent developments in police training in NSW and Queensland provide interesting models for consideration.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That an open inquiry be held into the training needs of the Victoria Police Force. Such an inquiry should consider the benefits of establishing a more substantial and thorough recruit training course. It should also consider the benefits of promoting tertiary education of force members within regular educational establishments. </B> <P>
<B>Incentives for such training should be made available and applicants should be supported financially and be duly recognised by the Force. </B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr10">10. Access To Justice The impact of police abuse of powers on access to justice <B><!--10. Access To Justice The impact of policeabuse of powers on access to justice --></B></A> </B> <P>
<B>There is a need to address the effect of an increased imbalance between police powers and resources and access to justice in the criminal justice system as a whole.</B> <P>
<B>While Police numbers and resources have increased, along with allegations of Police misconduct there has been no equivalent increase to legal aid funding.</B> <P>
<B>The Legal Aid Commission of Victoria refused almost 30% of legal aid applications for the period ending 30th June 1992 compared to 20% for the period ending 30th June 1991. Whilst 85% of legal aid recipients are living below the poverty line, many people unable to afford legal costs are not receiving any legal assistance due to more stringent legal aid guidelines. </B> <P>
<B>The Legal Aid Commission has had to increasingly reject applications due to significant budgetary constraints. Government funding has not kept pace with the increasing cost of cases due to their increased complexity and length.</B> <P>
<B>The failure of Governments to address the direct correlation between the impact on the demand for legal aid and increased police resources and powers could be interpreted by some that there is no longer a genuine commitment to justice in our community.</B> <P>
<B>People facing criminal charges in Victoria are now regularly being refused legal aid even when they have a very sound defence to the charge against them, on the grounds that they are unlikely to go to prison or receive substantial fines. These people are not in a position to be able to afford the cost of legal representation and are pleading guilty and being convicted simply because they have no means by which to present their case to the courts.</B> <P>
<B>The number of people appearing before Magistrates' Courts without the benefit of legal representation is rising dramatically probably for the first time since the development of Community Legal Centres in the early 1970's and the creation of Legal Aid Commissions in the early 80's.</B> <P>
<B>It is crucial for Government to address the direct correlation between the impact on the demand for legal aid and increased police resources and powers. </B> <P>
<B>Legal Aid impact statements should be considered as a matter of course whenever new legislation is being considered. Such statements should detail the effect on legal aid services, the court system and the corrections system of any legislative changes which in this instance would increase with police powers and resources. Linked to this, appropriate funding must be made available to ensure that the other parts of our criminal justice system are able to adequately deal with the flowon effect of these changes. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendations:</B> <P>
<B>Legal Aid Impact statements should be introduced as a matter of course whenever an increase in police powers or resources is occurring or new legislation is being considered. Such statements would detail the financial impact on the Criminal Justice System. Financial allowance compensating for the downstream impact of such powers or legislative change needs to be addressed. </B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr11">11. On The Spot Fines <B><!--11. On The Spot Fines --></B></A></B> <P>
<B>It has been said that the greater use of &quot;on the spot&quot; fines for a wide range of offences will relieve the workload of the police and the court system. In the 199091 financial year the Victoria Police collected $35 million in on the spot fines. </B> <P>
<B>Although having some benefits this system is &quot;regressive' as it disadvantages some people more than others because of the fixed nature of the fines and peoples varying ability to pay. The fines have vastly different impacts on different people because they take no account of a persons income or ability to pay. Many Victorian's are faced with heavy fines of this nature at a time when they are suffering great economic hardship. </B> <P>
<B>Most alarming however is that ordinary people have no hope of challenging them once they have been issued. Many people complain that some police officers incorrectly or unfairly issue such fines. </B> <P>
<B>It is not possible to get legal aid to challenge the fines and most people are not confident enough to put their story at court without legal representation and with the risk of receiving an even higher fine. It is true that on the spot fines save police and court time but some would say that this is high cost to freedom if it makes police officers judge and jury, and with the only real alternative for some who cannot afford to pay to spend time in jail.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>That a review be held into the operation of on the spot fines and that consideration be given to establishing a mechanism where complaints or objections are able to be heard in an informal and cost free environment. </B> <P>
<B>The review should also consider the introduction of a variable or progressive scale of fines which takes into account each persons ability to pay.</B> <P>
<B><A NAME="cr12">12. Victimless Crime <B><!--12. Victimless Crime --></B></A></B> <P>
<B>When the Victorian Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research released its 1991-92 Crime Statistics, one of the strongest trends revealed by the Bureau was the concentration of police resources on victimless crimes. </B> <P>
<B>Such findings are important in light of the significant policing of groups such as the young, Aboriginals, Public Housing Tenants and other groups often referred to as moral or victimless crime policing areas. The disproportionate concentration of police resources on prostitution and minor drug users raises serious questions about police practices and priorities which are out of step with community attitudes.</B> <P>
<B>12. 1 <I>Minor drug use</I><!--12. 1 --></B> <P>
<I><B>Minor drug use </B></I> <P>
<B>According to National Drug Offensive Surveys, the use of drugs in Victoria has remained constant since 1988. However the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research shows offences relating to Cannabis made up 79% of all drug offences an increase of 31% over the previous year. </B> <P>
<B>Marijuana use is widespread amongst Victorians and Australians in general. The targeting of this drug by police and the enormous resources required for this throughout the criminal justice system could be considered as an area for substantial law reform. Various Australian State initiatives currently exist which aim at decriminalisation and shifting Police resources into other more critical areas. Such law reform initiatives within the local context could be considered as a prime area for cost efficiencies and more appropriate allocation of resources.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation :</B> <P>
<B>That the State Government initiate law reform measures aimed at legalisation or decriminalisation of minor drug use based on similar initiatives implemented in other Australian States. </B> <P>
<B>12.2. <I>Prostitution </I><!--12.2. --></B> <P>
<I><B>Prostitution </B></I> <P>
<B>According to the 1991-92 Victorian Police Statistical Review of Crime, police filed charges against 741 people for offences related to prostitution. In comparison 1987-88 figures show 366 people were charged. The increase in prostitution related offences is an example of an increased vigilance in &quot;moral&quot; policing which is clearly out of step with community attitudes. </B> <P>

<I><B>Homosexual Sex </B></I><B><!-- --></B> <P>
<B>The charges of soliciting against Bishop Dowling, recently dropped by the DPP were considered &quot;...trivial and involved no victim in any accepted sense&quot;, according to Mr Bernard Bongiorno, QC (<U>Sunday Age</U> 30/8/92).</B> <P>
<B>The Chairman of the Law Reform Commission Mr David Kelly commented; </B> <P>
<B>&quot;The sort of thing alleged against Bishop Dowling doesn't seem the thing that criminal law should be concerned with. There are many more serious crimes. It's most unfortunate that we should bother with that&quot;.</B> <P>
<B>12.4. <I>Drunk in a public place, indecent language and obscene behaviour </I><!--12.4. --></B> <P>
<I><B>Drunk in a public place, indecent language and obscene behaviour </B></I> <P>
<B>Offences such as drunk in a public place, indecent language and obscene behaviour are often used as pretexts for taking people into custody, detaining them for a number of hours, and then subsequently charging them. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended that the offence of public drunkenness be abolished, and that people should not be arrested and charged for just using offensive language. </B> <P>
<B>On the issue of public drunkenness, a number of incidents of physical and verbal abuse arise following arrests for drunkenness. It is recommended that adequately funded programs to establish and maintain non-custodial facilities for the care and treatment of intoxicated persons should be established and that legislation should place a statutory duty upon police to consider and utilise these alternatives. Police should not be the sole arbiters in deciding on these alternatives.</B> <P>
<B>It is clear from the experience of Community Legal Centres that police use the charges of drunk and other summary offences to give them powers of arrest in the street to deal with a range of situations. </B> <P>
<B>12.5 <I>Offensive Language </I><!--12.5 --></B> <P>
<I><B>Offensive Language </B></I> <P>
<B>Police often use the charge of Offensive Language to assert their authority over people they deal with and also to control or diffuse situations. It should be emphasised that often the language used that forms the substance of this offence, is widely used in the community, and is also in common usage in the police force itself. It is submitted that this is another example of &quot;moral&quot; policing, which is out of step with community attitudes, and is no longer appropriate to be covered by the criminal law area. </B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>In line with Recommendation 79 of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody(RCIAD) and the Victorian Law Reform Commission Reports No. 25 and 32 the offence of public drunkenness should be abolished. Further in line with Recommendation 86 of the (RCIAD), people should not be arrested and charged for just using offensive language.</B> <P>
<B>Recommendation:</B> <P>
<B>In line with Recommendation 80 of the RCIADC it is recommended that adequately funded programs to establish and maintain non-custodial facilities for the care and treatment of intoxicated persons should be established and that legislation should place a statutory duty upon police to consider and utilise these alternatives. Police should not be the sole arbiters in deciding on these alternatives. </B> <H3><A NAME="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</A><!--CONCLUSION--></h3>

<B>It is the experience of legal centres that violence by police contributes significantly to violence in the community. The findings presented in this report objectively affirm this view. </B> <P>
<B>The data collected from this survey contributes to the growing amount of research on the nature and extent of police mistreatment of citizens. </B> <P>
<B>These results are worrying as they indicate a high level of fear and mistrust of the current process for handling complaints against the police. There is also a large number of people that are not aware how to complain.</B> <P>
<B>Almost half of those who complain do so to a lawyer and a further one third of the total sample had discussed the issue with a community worker. This suggests that their is a vital role to be played by lawyers and community workers and that there is a need to ensure that these professions are fully conversant with the police complaints process and that they also understand the level of fear and mistrust that the public has of the police complaints process.</B> <P>
<B>There is a great need for Government and a cross section of the community participation to be more involved in directing policing practices and priorities towards a crime prevention framework with appropriate accountability mechanisms. Discussion and debate must continue as to all aspects of policing and an honest appraisal of what needs to be improved developed. The real issues in achieving crime prevention and law enforcement must be tackled in a de-politicised way.</B> <P>
<B>The failure of Political Parties of all persuasions in Victoria to address the important issue of accountability of a major government department with an annual budget in excess of $600 million and which represents an armed force of over 10,000 individuals raises serious questions for Democracy and Justice in our society.</B> <br><Hr></ul>
