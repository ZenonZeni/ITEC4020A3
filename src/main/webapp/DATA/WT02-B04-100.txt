(1) NEW ELECTRONIC HEALTH INFORMATION PROVISIONS POSE PRIVACY RISKS

"The Medical Records Confidentiality Act" (S. 1360) remains stalled as 
Congress continues its summer recess.  The Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee indefinitely delayed mark-up of the bill due to opposition from a
number of industry groups.

Although S. 1360 (also known as the Bennett-Leahy bill) remains in limbo,
Congress did take some action that impacts medical records privacy.  The 
recently-passed Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HR 3103) contains a section known as 
"Administrative Simplification."  This section of the Act mandates the
development and adoption of standards for electronic exchanges of health 
information.  It also mandates that Congress or the Secretary of Health and
Human Services (HHS) develop privacy rules to govern such electronic 
exchanges; however, these rules may not be in place before the electronic 
system is implemented. 

CDT and other privacy and consumer advocates urged Congress to include strong,
comprehensive privacy rules in any administrative simplification proposal
considered by Congress.  While we fell short of that goal, there are a number 
of provisions in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill that impact on individual privacy,
data confidentiality and security.  Most importantly, the law mandates that
Congress enact privacy rules to protect health information within the next 36
months; and, if Congress fails to act, the law requires the Secretary of HHS 
to promulgate final regulations establishing privacy rules within the 
following six months.

While the passage of administrative simplification language without strong
statutory privacy protections included at the outset is disappointing and 
threatens privacy, the recently enacted provisions set a privacy agenda in two 
areas.  It provides an opportunity to reinvigorate efforts in Congress to act 
upon pending health information privacy legislation, and to work with the 
Department of Health and Human Services to develop privacy regulations.  

CDT believes it is critical that supporters of the Bennett-Leahy bill and
similar legislative proposals seize this opportunity to move health privacy
legislation.  It is imperative that privacy safeguards be in place prior to 
the development or adoption of standards for electronic handling of health
information.  CDT looks forward to working with other privacy and consumer
advocates to support national health privacy policy.

     -----------------------------------------

SYNOPSIS OF ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION LANGUAGE

Administrative Simplification

The law directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: 

* adopt standards for the electronic exchange of a variety of health care
  transactions;
 
* adopt standards for a unique health identifier for each individual, 
  employer health plan and health care provider;

* adopt security standards for health information; and

* adopt safeguards that require those who maintain or transmit health
  information to adopt reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical,
  and physical safeguards that will protect the integrity and 
  confidentiality, and protect against unauthorized uses and disclosures of
  health information.

It requires covered entities to come into compliance with standards within 24 
months of their adoption.  

     --------------------

Privacy Provisions

* Within 12 months of enactment, HHS must submit a report to Congress on the
  privacy of individually identifiable health information.  The report must
  address the rights individuals should have with respect to such information,
  the procedures that should be established for exercising these rights, and
  the uses and disclosures of information that should be authorized or 
  required.

* Within 36 months of passage, Congress must enact legislation protecting 
  the privacy of health information in standards for electronic exchange.

* If Congress fails to enact privacy legislation within 36 months, HHS must
  promulgate final regulations protecting the privacy of health information
  in standards for electronic exchange within the following six months.

* The law maintains existing state confidentiality statutes that are stronger
  than those enacted by Congress or promulgated by HHS.

* The law establishes criminal and civil penalties for those who knowingly 
  and in violation of the act:
     - misuse unique health identifiers;
     - obtain individually identifiable health information;
     - disclose individually identifiable health information.
