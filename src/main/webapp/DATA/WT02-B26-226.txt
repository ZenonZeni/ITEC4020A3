<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies to develop a multiyear research plan.  With an office-wide Strategic Program Planning initiative already in progress, the challenge was to integrate efforts to respond to this congressional requirement. 
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
The staff of Argonne National Laboratory's Center for Transportation Research developed a research plan and assembled a multidisciplinary team of researchers to provide quick-response technical, engineering, and economic analysis services. The effort was planned as an inter-laboratory activity, including the participation of personnel at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the University of Tennessee.
<P>
A key element of the research approach involved the use of comprehensive computer analysis techniques that provided definitive projections of energy savings and environmental and economic benefits of the advanced transportation technologies. Market-penetration estimates from the Alternative Vehicle Sales (AVS) model developed by DOE provided inputs to Argonne's Integrated Market Penetration and Anticipated Cost of Transportation Technologies (IMPACTT) and Argonne Multisector Industry Growth Assessment (AMIGA) models. The models were used to generate estimates of the reductions in petroleum use and criteria air pollutants, as well as increases in the Gross Domestic Product and employment benefits. An iterative approach was used to develop the research plan, with frequent submissions and close coordination with the sponsor.

<B>Results</B>
<P>
A comprehensive draft of the plan was developed and submitted for review and comment within six weeks of the start of work. Subsequent submittals were provided after comments were received from Office of Transportation Technologies staff, industry peers, senior DOE management and general counsel, the Office of Management and Budget, and other federal agencies.  The plan was transmitted to Congress in August 1994.
<P>
The methodology and results were also used by DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy for several ongoing technology assessment and program evaluation efforts, as well as for other submissions required by the 1992 Energy Policy Act.
<P>
Projections show that OTT's programs could boost Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by $583 billion by 2020.  As indicated in the accompanying table, the benefits will accrue from growth in the GDP resulting from reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and oil use and a projected decrease in the world price of oil due to the use of advances in transportation technology.
<P>
<P> 
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
The planning methodology has been updated and is currently being applied to office program assessment and development efforts.
