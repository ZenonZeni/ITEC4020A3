<img src="../caps/acap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="A"> lan Hed is accustomed to seeing counterfeit versions of Procter & Gamble's soaps and detergents while checking shelves of streetside kiosks. The HCMC-based country manager for one of the world's largest consumer-products company knows that some Vietnamese have Picasso-like talent when it comes to wrapping knock-off goods in P&G's packaging. He expected as much before arriving in HCMC two years ago and claims he is going after the counterfeiters as aggressively as ever, with the help of the "economic police" and the Ministry of Culture and Information's (MCI) copyright department.<p>

What he did not expect was that he would end up pursuing a case against a non-Vietnamese firm: Procter & Gamble's arch-rival, Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant. Such was the case recently when Hed saw an advertisement on Vietnam Television for Unilever's anti-dandruff, Clear shampoo. For Hed and the marketing department at P&G, the ad bore too close a resemblance to Procter & Gamble's spot for its equivalent shampoo, Head and Shoulders.<p>

"We spent a lot of money in research developing the key hair shots, we were on the air at least two months prior, and to have the ads copied is confusing to the customers," Hed said vehemently. For their part, Unilever officials said any similarity between the ads was coincidental and that it had been running an identical ad in South American markets for months.<p>

While representatives from both Unilever and P&G say the conflict has been resolved, the heated dispute points to the importance both are placing on Vietnam's emerging demand for quality goods. But even as competition between the two intensifies, they are finding themselves allied in defending their presence to local companies who fear the multinational giants are putting them out of business.<p>

The Right Products<br>
at the Right Price
</font><p>

<img src="../caps/icap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="I">t is not an exaggeration to claim that Vietnam is a promising and important market for the world's two largest makers of personal care (soaps, shampoos, toothpaste) and household products (laundry detergent). Unlike, say, auto manufacturers, P&G and Unilever can reasonably say they're targeting 65-70 million potential consumers. While their products may still be a luxury item for most Vietnamese, packets of soap, detergent and shampoo have relatively low unit price and are sold everywhere from the smallest village in Phu Yen province, to the major urban centers from Haiphong to Cantho. And sales are only increasing as disposable incomes steadily rise.<p>

Vietnam is an especially ripe market because consumers spent much of the 1980s using extremely low-quality soaps and detergents. One longtime expat said the Soviet or Vietnamese-made soaps for sale in the late 1980's "were barely fit for washing cloth, much less putting on your body." Indeed, a treasured gift still sent home by overseas Vietnamese to families for the Tet holidays are foreign-made soaps and shampoos.<p>

Unilever's brands like Lux soap, Close-Up toothpaste, and Dimension shampoo, as well as P&G's Tide detergent, Pantene shampoo, and Camay soap have been meeting the demand for better soaps since the early 1990s, when they first arrived at  shops in HCMC and Hanoi through official and unofficial imports.<p>

But to truly penetrate the market, both firms had to set up manufacturing operations. Legal imports of personal care products face strict quotas, and high import taxes. More importantly, establishing manufacturing JVs allowed Unilever and P&G to manage distribution with their JV partners,  a critical advantage for successfully navigating Vietnam's labyrinthine distribution channels and poor infrastructure.

Both companies now have manufacturing JVs producing soaps, detergents, and toothpastes. Unilever has invested $48.3 million in two manufacturing JVs: Lever Haso in Hanoi and Lever Viso in Ho Chi Minh City. In April 1994, only two months after the US trade embargo was lifted, P&G took a 70% stake in a $14.3 million joint venture with Phuong Dong company in Song Be Province. With manufacturing under way and distribution networks established, both companies are growing at a rapid clip.<p>

One industry executive estimates Unilever's detergents have already won 35% market share by volume, powered by its OMO brand launched in January, 1996. Unilever Viso general director Jacques Ferriere says, "The fact that we have gained a dominant position in one sector (detergents), and a leading position in all the others is quite an achievement."<p>

P&G's Hed estimates annual growth for their products has been between 8% and 15%. "We're pleased with our growth. It's going as per plan." Both firms are blanketing the country's shops with product, not simply targeting the urban minimarts where only a small percentage of their sales exist. Unilever's Ferriere estimates his company is working with 45,000 shops nationwide on a weekly basis.<p>

Not all of the young generation of consumers have been converted to the shampoos, however. One 26 year-old Hanoi resident, Ms. Phuong Vo, says she still prefers traditional Vietnamese hair care -- washing with the non-edible, black fruit, "bo ket." She cooks the fruit for 15 minutes then mixes it with ginger and shoots of grass that grow in rice paddies. "I hate shampoo. Only Vietnam has bo ket and it helps my hair become blacker," she said. "But only the old women and people like me use it. My friends prefer shampoo because its quicker."<p>

The Perils of Success
</font><p>

<img src="../caps/pcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="P">&G and Unilever may now be wondering whether they are enjoying too much success. Local producers of detergents, soaps and other consumer goods have become noticeably vocal recently, concerned to see their share of the market eroded by the superior products and marketing expertise of multinationals. While Unilever and P&G officials expect local brands to develop, as has been the trend in Malaysia where local producers now own 40% of the market, they are alarmed by the tone of the localization movement in Vietnam.<p>

One informed source said, "This industry is going through a very intense moment right now. We're pitted against the local industry that's using whatever tricks they can in order to try to block us, curb our growth, or smear us."<p>

Executives from local consumer-goods companies met at a seminar in HCMC in late May to debate how to fit the interests of multinational behemoths within a master plan to promote and protect local businesses. Mr. Nguyen Dinh Quang, Chief of the Ministry of Trade's chemicals import department, says some foreign companies are using marketing tricks like free giveaways and price cuts. "There are too many foreign JVs in the soap/detergent/shampoo business in Vietnam," he said. "Some use 'tricks' in advertising like giving away high-quality free samples of shampoo. After they invade the market, they increase the price, and the quality is not as good as the free samples. With this unfair strategy they manage to compete and crush the local companies in this field," he said.<p>

Some observers say the movement against foreign JVs has become especially virulent in recent weeks. Chris Bruton of Bangkok-based Dataconsult observes, "I think there's been quite a lot of moves to encourage the local brands in the aftermath of the Party Congress. There's been quite a lot of reaction against major multinationals gaining ascendency over local brands."<p>

Executives from P&G and Unilever are concerned that the government may take steps to limit foreign JVs from expanding production in Vietnam, or may force the companies into early profit-taking.<p>

P&G's Hed says that under-cutting local producers' prices is the last thing the foreign JVs want to do. He argues that P&G's brands are always more expensive than locally produced brands, and that, if anything, they're trying to raise their prices as quickly as the market will bear. "Our prices are anywhere from 20-100% higher than the local products. We do not compete on price," Hed emphasized, "we compete on the quality of our product."<p>

Reps from both companies are quick to point out the benefits that the JVs bring in the form of training hundreds of employees, transferring technology and marketing expertise, and improving the products that their respective JV partners once produced. Unilever's Ferriere says "A good part of our growth is benefitting local industry," because Unilever enters into third-party contracts with local companies who either are suppliers or produce other soap and shampoo products.<p>

Some economists believe the increased competition helps in the long run because it encourages inefficient companies to switch to businesses where they can better compete. P&G's Hed says the emergence of foreign companies has opened up new business opportunities in packaging and raw materials for local producers Duc Giang and Tico, for example.
"The companies who continue to progress, who modernize their technology, modernize their selling approaches, and are effective marketers will be the ones who survive," Hed said, "The ones who do not change, whether it's P&G, Unilever, or a local company, will be the ones who get left behind."<p>

As for the television ads in contention, Mr. Thuong Thuan, vice-director of the Copyright Protection department says Unilever agreed to change the Clear advertisement. While executives from P&G and Unilever claim the ads have not changed, for now, relations between the two HCMC offices are again cordial.<p>

And Ms. Vo, the Hanoi resident who swears by the bo ket fruit shampoo, is one reason why Unilever might be pleased to be keeping its spots the same. She said that maybe two times a month when she comes home late from work, she resorts to using Clear shampoo because, "It's quicker, it cleans the dandruff and my hair is softer." How did she learn Clear shampoo might perform these miracles? "I saw the advertisement."<p>
