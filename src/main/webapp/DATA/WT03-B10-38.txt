ADVANCE NOTES. Quietly (very quietly), a consortium of five major 
film/camera companies have been working together to come up with a 
new type of camera and film to meet the competition from the digital 
arena. In February they'll be unveiling their product to the 
photography industry. Using new technology ranging from magnetic 
strips on film, to printed information on the back of pictures, the 
new system, called APS (Advanced Photo System), is bound to attract 
general consumers and eventually professionals. Here's our two-part 
report:

FILM FOREVER !


Film and camera manufacturers know where the big dollar is. With your 
average consumer. These companies have secretly engineered a new 
film/camera product that is aimed at holding the deep foothold they 
have dug in the consumer industry. To keep these customers, they've 
in essence invented a new picture-taking method: the Advanced Photo 
System (APS).

WHEN YA CAN'T FIGHT 'EM


Long-time foes, KODAK and FUJI, plus three other entries (Nikon, 
Canon, and Minolta) have formed a consortium over the last five years 
in an attempt to secretly counter the obvious commercial threat to 
them from digital photography. The result of their efforts is a dream 
come true for anyone who isn't interested in f-stops, lighting 
formulae, flash factors, color balances, and all the complexities 
photography instructors build their careers on. The five companies 
will introduce the Advance Photo System to the world in February, and 
the system will be in stores by early spring.

Some highlights:

FILM. It'll be 24mm wide negative film, not transparencies. Exposures 
of 14,25, and 40. You won't get it back from the processor in those 
fingerprint-prone strips anymore. The rolled film will return in its 
original cassette. And you won't get blank film back if you loaded it 
wrong.  You can't load it wrong.
CONTACT SHEETS. You'll get back postcard-size sheets with miniature, 
numbered, color pictures on them, ready to select for print-making. 
There'll be no wasteful volume printing of everything on the roll. 
Instead, you'll select customized sizes for your pictures of top 
priority.
PRINTS. By pushing a button on the camera, you'll be able to encode 
on the film what eventual print sizes you want for specific shots, 
ranging from full-frame to panoramic views.
QUALITY. Overexposure and underexposure will be no longer be a 
problem, or at least, will be negligible. A beeper on your camera 
will ask you if you are trying to be creative or if you've made a 
wrong aperture decision.
AUDIO. On the more advanced systems, you'll get "film with smarts." 
The magnetic strip on the film will store spoken instructions and 
other data.
CAPTIONS. The magnetic strip will also automatically store 
information about the exposure, location, species, genus, model names 
and releases, or historical data. Your film processor can use the 
stored data to make exposure adjustments, on a frame-by-frame basis. 
You'll also get details (if you want them) printed out on the back of 
each finished picture.
PRICE. Film will be in the normal price ranges. Cameras will cost 
from $25 for a throw-away to big bucks for the sophisticated models.

Ten years ago, who would've thought you could make the Evening News?  
Well, not you, but the footage from your camcorder. It's possible 
today. We see it all the time.
We, the people, are all becoming reporters of the world around us. As 
a stock photographer, you have an inside avenue to the markets where 
your pictures are sold. New technology, both digital and film, is 
making it easier to record, catalog, and later transmit your images. 
Not just to the local media, but worldwide. The new Advanced Photo 
System (APS) portends to expand this influence of stock photography. 
Fasten your seat belts, the ride into the next century of photo 
illustration is going to be exciting.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
It's expected the new APS will take a few years to become accepted by 
the public. One hurdle: everyone seems to have a 35-mm camera. The 
cassettes for APS are not adaptable to standard 35mm cameras. And 
there's always the uncomfortable echo of past attempts to rejuvenate 
the sluggish consumer photography industry. Remember the "disk 
cameras" of a decade ago?
Here at PhotoSource International we see the APS system as a 
potentially excellent transition technology for both stock 
photographers and photobuyers. New companies will licence the 
technology and offer improvements and peripherals. Although the APS 
is aimed initially at the consumer market, as it matures, 
advancements will evolve as user-friendly technology fit for 
professionals and flow well with paralleling advancements in digital 
imagery. -RE

For Stock Photographers....
THE INTERNET AS A WHOLE, IS A HOLE


The Internet last year as a whole doubled in size.  Or rather, as a 
hole.  It's a deep pit for the unwary stock photographer.  If there's 
any substantive commerce for independent stock photographers on the 
Internet, I'd like to hear about it.

What I read and hear about are Internet products, books, courses, WEB 
Sites, peripherals, consultant software, training, conferences, 
chats, and all other varieties of the Medicine Show.  Everyone's 
gearing up to learn, but where are the sales?

C'mon.  Someone please step forward and tell us they've found the 
Internet to be a more cost-effective way to make sales than through 
conventional methods.

The single action I see on the Internet is by amateur art directors 
who are on fishing trips, trying to reel in Clip Art prices from 
uninformed photographers.

Step aside, television, we have a new pencil sharpener, a new waste 
land for procrastinators.  We've gone beyond the word processing 
merry-go-round, Oprah, Rush, and headphones.  Now it's the Internet.

In Mark Twain or Walt Whitman's era, when writers wanted to 
procrastinate, they'd sharpen pencils.  The writer would get up from 
the desk and grind away at the pencil sharpener in an attempt to look 
like something of substance was getting accomplished.  Then 
television took over as aider and abetter to procrastinators.

Net potatoes today find the Internet an escape.

So far, the Internet can hardly be called a highway of productivity.  
An hour surfing the Internet is foolishly spent on time you could be 
advancing your stock photography career.  The Internet as a highway
has no stop lights, speed limits, guard rails, or accident 
prevention--just toll booths.

The Internet for stock photographers is populated by inexperienced 
people using tools that haven't reached maturity. But it is pumped up 
by professionals--marketing professionals who know how to take an 
empty thoroughfare and turn it into the glamour and glitter of Las 
Vegas.  Listen to the rhetoric.  Put a blindfold on and substitute 
the word "Used Car" for "Internet" and you'll recognize familiar 
hype.

But take heart, it's coming.  Many interesting things can be found at 
the bottom of a pit:  gold, diamonds, ancient coins, even crude oil!

However, don't fall into the pit without some tools to get yourself 
back out, as well as a plan to mine the pit.  You can join those 
ever-present pioneers who are ready to descend into any pit on the 
chance of ascending to greater heights.  I applaud them.

We talk by phone and fax with dozens of photobuyers each week in the 
course of our photo listing gathering here at PhotoSource 
International.  Photobuyers in the magazine and book world tell us 
they are not available on the Internet and don't plan to be soon.  If 
this changes, we'll be the first to let you know. -RE

Ed. Note: Be sure to read "The Internet: Thumbs Down -- Ten good 
reasons for stock photographers to stay out of the net."

A NEW KIND OF HIGHWAY BRIGAND


The scene is a court room.  The judge, with gavel in hand, has just 
heard a stock photographer plead his case.  The defendant, an art 
director at a mid-size ad agency, has been accused of "borrowing" 
part of the photographer's photo and using it in an ad campaign.

The gavel comes down.  The judge rules for the photographer and 
glares at the ad agency art director.  "You willfully stole part of 
this photographer's picture.  I'm going to fine you within the full 
extent of the law, $750, the price you would have had to pay for this 
photo if you had acquired it through appropriate business channels."

The ad agency director smiles.

"What?"  The photographer gasps.  "You mean someone can steal my 
photos and use them for free and if they get caught all they have to 
pay is the price they would have paid anyway for the photo if they 
would have gone through regular channels?"

"I'm afraid that's the way the Copyright Law presently reads," says 
the judge.

"Yet I have to pay my attorney, and court costs, and all my downtime, 
about $3500, that it took to pursue my rights in this case???"

Gavel comes down again.  "Next case!"  says the judge.

                   MODERN-DAY BRIGANDS

    The photographer in this case could be you.  Digital technology 
already makes it very easy for art directors to "borrow" images and 
portions of images from magazines, catalogs, posters, or original 
art, and use them for their own purposes.  They know that litigation 
is too costly for an individual photographer.  The information 
highway is producing a new kind of robber, the digital image thief.

As we travel down the information highway, no other profession will 
be as vulnerable to thievery as ours.  Parts of pictures can be 
stolen with little or no detection.

And even if you detect it, it doesn't matter whether you can prove 
that part of your photo was pilfered.  If by some remarkable chance a 
thief is found out, the way the law is interpreted now, unless the 
image has formal copyright registration protection, the robber gets 
away without punishment.  And he's free to continue to roam the 
highway, picking off victims at will.  Few photographers formally 
register every one of their pictures (at $20 per).

In medieval days, when vandals roamed the countryside, the populace 
depended on the Baron and his castle for protection.  In a sense, 
individuals were torn between the evils of vandals and the 
corruptions of land barons.

                        __________
              "...the ease of picking out parts of digital images is 
too irresistible to digit pickers..."
                        ----------

Not until citizens gained individual rights and legal protection, did 
real freedom become reality.

As individual stock photographers, we have been knocked back to 
medieval times.  Digital imagery has done this to us.  The ease of 
picking out parts of digital images is too irresistible to digit 
pickers at graphic houses and ad agencies.

Large stock agencies, with their financial resources, no doubt may 
set some precedents and win a few court battles against the digital 
vandals.  But the message to commercial art directors will be:  "If 
you see an image you want, make sure it doesn't belong to a large 
stock agency or a digital service bureau.  Instead prey on the 
individual photographer who will never be able to afford to fight 
us."

For photographers, the message will be:  "I'd better give up my 
individuality and go with a large stock agency (the Baron in the 
Castle) so he can protect me."

We need a Pied Piper, someone who will lead us away from the digital 
vandals, and away from the Barons who offer us protection but 
sometimes at the cost of our creative freedom.  We need someone who 
will set a precedent with the Copyright Office and establish painful 
repercussions in the graphics community for any pilfering of an image 
or parts of an image, whether the original belongs to a massive stock 
agency, a small stock agency, or Jane Doe producing individual photos 
from her cabin in Montana.

DIGITS IS MONEY


Eventually, the banking industry will be completely digitized.  
Already, here at the farm as one example, most of our revenue the 
form of credit card payments (digits). We use a Control Data program 
called TELEMONY to deposit these digits, and the digits end up in our 
bank via the Federal Reserve.

We also offer a program for "automatic checks," called Check-O-Matic, 
for persons who are not into credit cards. Our bank talks 
electronically to the bank where their have there checking account 
(digits).

Photos are getting digitized too. Eventually, the stock photo 
industry will be completely digitized.

MONEY IN THE BANK

It can be said that digitized photos and digitized money are becoming 
synonymous, and that if you have a bank of photos, then you have 
money in the bank.

Commerce is conducted when there's an exchange of money (digits).
However, the stock photo industry today, as well as the rest of the 
commercial community, face the same hurdles to achieve security 
systems that the banking industry faced 35 years ago when electronic 
transfer of money (digits) was introduced.

Over the past three decades, banks have produced an effective 
(secure) system for transferring digits.  No secure system exists yet 
for photos (or text), or finaicial transactions in the open 
marketplace.

Several commercial companies are focusing enery and dollars to solve 
their security problems, and some even do boast of having "secure" 
systems on the Internet.  One such firm is Netscape--but two 
announcements last year of "holes" in the Netscape Navigator have 
Internet merchants scurrying for an explanation. In one case, two 
Berkeley students cracked the program's security code and publicized 
their finding on the Internet.

By the way, if you are a programmer with a hacker's mentality and are 
looking for a gainful programming position, the best way to get to 
the head of the line is to crack the Internet and publicize your 
findings.  Industry will scoop you up and employ your talents. -RE

UPDATELESS


Inevitable: Death, Taxes, and Updates. There's no getting around it, 
updates of your software is now a fact of our digital lives. A visit 
to the library to look over some 1980's computer magazines and you 
wonder how we could've been so naive in those days. Now, when a new 
accounting program comes along we know better than to call it the 
program of the century (even with only four more years of the century 
left). We're talking maybe four more months and it'll be outdated. 
Don't fight it. Without updates (new versions) of your current 
software, you fall behind. Buy the updates; they'll be worth the 
investment. -RE

WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH COPYRIGHT CHANGES?

Not enough, according to copyright attorney, Stephen R. Bergerson.
ASMP and several other groups concerned with intellectual properties 
have attempted to introduce sensible changes to the Copyright Act, 
but with little success so far.  Photographers would like to see 
changes in Sections 104(a), 405, 406, 408(a) and 412(2), which 
require that an individual photograph be formally registered within 
three months after publication or before an infringement problem 
comes up in order to be eligible for full legal recourse.
Currently it's not feasible for photographers to go through the 
formal 
                       - - - - - - - - - - -
                     "Legislation always lags
                      far behind technology...."
                       - - - - - - - - - - -
registration process for each photo (and at $20 a crack), in order to 
protect themselves "just in case," so that they're eligible to 
receive statutory damages in the event infringement happens.  This 
requirement needs to be abolished in order to eliminate the loophole 
for digital thievery as presented in the theoretical case above.
"We know that copyright changes are coming.  But Congress is trying 
to find answers for questions that haven't been asked yet," says 
Bergerson.  "Electronic transmission of images is presenting a new 
playing field.  And we're wrestling with the age-old problem of 
legislation always lagging far behind technology."

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
ADDITIONAL PROPOSED COPYRIGHT LAW CHANGES:

o Elimination of enumerated categories of works

o Add transmission as an exclusive right

o Ban copying and importation by transmission

o Expand "publication" to include transmission

o Disqualify transmissions from "first sale" exception

o Ban manufacture/importation/distribution of anti-copying systems 
overrides

o Ban fraudulent inclusion/removal of copyright info

SMOLAN GOES INTERNET 

On February 8th, Rick Smolan (Day In The Life series, Passages from 
Vietnam, etc.) and over 100 of the world's top photojournalists will 
take part in 24 Hours in Cyberspace. Their targets will be the most 
intriguing stories from the on-line frontier, from rural Nepal to 
Oakland's inner-city ghetto to the boardrooms of New York City. Their 
focus will be on the human stories behind the technology; the new 
ways in which we work, play, learn, conduct business and interact.
The results will be instantly visible around the world, through one 
of the largest on-line events ever produced. Images will be 
transmitted digitally back to the project's headquarters in San 
Francisco, where Smolan's team will assemble a unique "instant" World 
Wide Web site, with updates throughout the day. Simultaneously, 
millions of on-line viewers will be invited to submit their own 
stories of how the digital revolution is affecting their lives. Many 
of these stories will become part of the "instant" Web site as well.
A permanent World Wide Web site will be unveiled on March 15th, 
featuring even more in-depth stories, photo essays, and commentaries.

UNCLE SAM'S DIRECT REFUND 

Getting your Federal tax refund electronically deposited into your 
bank account no longer requires that you file your return 
electronically.  Now you can attach Form 8888 to your return (even if 
filing the old-fashioned way--via paper), and the IRS will send the 
refund directly to your bank. And, you'll get it about a week earlier 
than mailed refunds, too. Last year 68% of returns filed resulted in 
a refund, so get in line for yours!

TAX TACTICS:


WHEN YOUR CAMERA IS STOLEN
The best protection for your camera equipment, of course, is 
prevention.  Relatively recent law changes drastically tightened the 
rules on deductions for casualty theft losses. It is now much more 
difficult to qualify for tax relief when you suffer property damage 
of your photography equipment. The damage must be the result of an 
auto accident, fire, flood, vandalism, storm, theft, or some other 
event that is sudden, unexpected, or unusual in nature. Even in these 
circumstances there are restrictions.

Both the past and present rules allow write-offs for uninsured losses 
on property used for personal purposes only if you itemize your 
deductions.  Another restriction imposed by the old and current rules 
is that you cannot deduct the first $100 of loss from any casualty or 
theft incident.

Julian Block, a former IRS agent and tax attorney, is the author of "Julian
Block's Tax Avoidance Secrets" (560 pages) $33.95 (3 Washington Sq, Larchmont
NY 10538-2032).  He can be reached on PRODIGY (EXPT16B).

YOU AND THE LAW:


As a photographer your understanding of the law is crucial to the survival of
your business.

REVIEW OF AN AGENCY'S BOOKS AND RECORDS.  It's appropriate for you to 
have the right to review, or audit, your stock agency's books and 
records, as they relate to your images and sales, on a regular basis, 
upon reasonable notice.  An audit is at your cost, but if an error of 
5% or more is disclosed, the agency will usually agree to pay such 
cost.  Although it is rare for a photographer to actually conduct an 
official audit, it is important to reserve the right to be able to do 
so in your contract.

Attorney Joel L Hecker lectures and writes extensively on issues of concern to
the photography industry.  His office is located at Russo & Burke, 600 Third
Ave, New York NY 10016.  1 212 557-9600.

VERTICAL MARKETING
PART VI


FRAGMENTATION: The Gold Mine For the Photo Illustrator

There seems to be an immutable law of cyberspace that goes something 
like this, "The more information you have available, the less you 
have available." You've probably experienced the same thing when 
surfing the variety of TV channels you now have available to you: 
"There's nothing on TV anymore. Unless you want to watch the cat and 
dog show competition in Bulgaria." Human nature dictates that the 
more choices we have, the less satisfied we are.  (Ignorance is 
bliss.)

In the business world, the law of supply and demand takes over. A 
weekly cat and dog show from Bulgaria wouldn't last long if there 
were 1.) no viewers, and 2.) no sponsors. REALITY: If the show 
survives, it's because there's a market for it.

Where do you fit in? As a photo illustrator in the new generation of 
stock photography, the speedy delivery of text and images makes the 
global market a goldmine for you, if you specialize.

THE KEY:  FRAGMENTATION

The fragmentation of information will work in your favor. No longer 
will photobuyers be seeking a picture of a cat. They'll want a White 
Manx or an Abyssinian silver male cat. If you have a way with cats 
and love photographing them, you will become an important resource to 
a book publisher in Singapore who is producing a coffee table book on 
Black Persian cats.

To the rest of us, such photo requests will seem way out in left 
field, much the same as we feel about the arcane selection of shows 
we see listed on cable TV these days. But to you, the specialist in 
cats of the Near East, the photo request will be right down your 
alley. You'll make not only a sale, but a new contact to add to your 
cluster of buyers that you can count on for sales in the years ahead.

THERE'S HOPE

Does the trend toward specialization mean we are coming to a static 
resting place in our development as stock photographers? Bottleneck 
problems result when we acquire massive amounts of information, but 
have no speedy system to process, transmit, or filter it. But, as is 
happening in many of the medical sciences, electronics, and even 
molecular biology (using DNA as its model), our paths along 
specialized routes may all converge into one gigantic ballroom where 
we would capitalize on the quick delivery of information. Inventions 
such as molecular computers may one day be the solution. Locating and 
transmitting pictures will be as quick as turning the page in this 
newsletter. In the meantime, it's all about putting bread on the 
table, and fragmentation is the key.

HIGHWAY HEADLIGHTS

As the I-Way begins to build, keep your eye on the movers and shakers 
who are developing stock photo sites.  As electronic retrieval of 
picture information becomes easier, more and more photobuyers will 
begin to weigh the advantages of looking for their pictures on the 
I-Way.  But don't make the mistake of being a general merchant; 
you're sure to crash.  Instead, choose a specialty areas that you 
enjoy (wild horses couldn't pull you away), and begin developing 
in-depth coverage now.  Photobuyers in your niche of the marketplace 
will come first to you when they discover you have the pictures that 
they need.  -RE

CORBIS -A MONOPOLY?


I hear it over and over, 'Corbis Media is going to take over our 
industry'....at my seminars, on the Net, at conferences, meetings, 
phone calls.

No it's not.

Corbis Media is the proprietor of a large archive of images, yes. But 
a monopoly, it is not. When Corbis Media is at full capacity, it will 
represent perhaps about 1% of the images on this planet. It is no 
more going to put you out of business than your local lending library 
is going to put newspaper, magazine and book publishers out of 
business.

The impact from libraries has been the reverse:  More books are being 
bought today. 10,000 new publishers are signing up for ISBN's (the 
i.d. #'s in the book industry) each year.  Last year there were 
119,000 new titles published and over a million books printed.
There's no such thing as monopoly culture when it comes to 
communicating.

Vast libraries like Corbis, KPX\Sprint, PNI and any future ones that 
may enter the scene are essentially storehouses of generalized 
photos. These Goliaths aren't geared to collect deep files on every 
subject, every topic, every corner of the world.

For that reason, photobuyers will turn to their "specialty shops" - 
you - when they want expertise in a subject and depth of coverage for 
greater choice, to offer their readers exceptional, insightful 
photography - which after all, sells books and magazines. -RE.

TRAVEL NOTES:

Here's the travel photographer's dilemma. You're taking pictures in a 
foreign country. You come across someone whose photo you just have to 
have. You don't speak her language; she doesn't speak yours. You 
can't ask for permission to shoot, or, in case you need it, for her 
to sign a model release. And you don't want to snap away and then 
walk away. Although in the USA this might be considered normal by the 
general public, in some foreign countries it might be considered 
rude. In some cultures, worse than rude.

Here's one solution. Pull out your Polaroid camera. Take a portrait 
shot and give it to the person. Usually, they'll be delighted with 
the gift and happy to have you then photograph them with your 35mm 
camera to your heart's content.

DAVID BROWNELL
David Brownell was working for the Aspen Ski Corp. back in 1975 when 
he discovered he could turn his photography hobby into a profitable 
business. When ski magazines started buying his photos (and one of 
his shots on a cover) he knew he could compete with the pros.
The magazine work led to assignments (one company sent him to 
Kilimanjaro). Eventually he migrated to the East coast where his 
western style of ski shooting was in great demand. The move was a 
challenge: no more spectacular mountains, crisp blue skies, mild, and 
mild dry weather of the Rockies. "The East is wet, windy and COLD. I 
keep my EOS1N batteries always charged.  My socks and boots are 
always dry -never wet. And for dexterity, I wear Thermax Gloves with 
fingerless bunting gloves (available in hunting and fishing supply 
store) over top. Never use wool gloves; they have a tendency to get 
strands wound up into your film cartridges."

RIGHTS GRABS. The "siege" of the New York Times by freelance writers 
and their organizations (to protect writers' rights to appropriate 
payment) continues to attract attention.
Along parallel lines, a year ago, TIME Inc. announced a policy 
covering freelance photography that included electronic rights issues 
unacceptable to ASMP, PP of A and other photo groups.  The squeaky 
wheel gets the grease.  Some of TIME Inc.'s periodicals began mailing 
new freelance contracts that did not demand electronic rights, and 
promised royalties for electronic use starting in 1998; demanding, 
however, free use until then.  Multi more protests later, the 
magazines have reportedly again revised their contracts, dropping 
CD-ROM's from the electronic use clause and adding small up front 
payments to cover online use until royalties begin.
The American Society of Journalists and Authors (we are members) 
continues to follow the New York Times Rights Grab.  For more

A WEB SITE "HIT" is the terminology marketing people use when they 
refer to a visitor they attract to their Web Site on the Internet. 
The numbers of 'hits' are always large (15,000, 150,000, etc.). The 
numbers are impressive until you realize these aren't sales, or even 
prospects. They're curious people, window shoppers.
Here at PhotoSource International, we've been photographed and 
featured in several major magazines--TIME Magazine (a half page 
photo), POPULAR PHOTOGRAPHY, MONEY, USA TODAY (quarter page photos), 
CHANGING TIMES (on the cover).  Each person that read these articles 
could be considered the same type of 'hit.' This adds up to several 
million 'hits' over the years. Here's where you get the difference 
between advertising and publicity. While this kind of exposure is 
beneficial for the big picture and long term--does it result in sales 
today? Were we able to covert any of the inquiries? Few. Most were 
window shoppers. We've found, for our business, that the best 
advertising is direct marketing, going straight to a qualified 
prospect through the U.S. mail or a carrier service.  -RE

ON-LINE IMAGE LIBRARIES:  WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?


A handful of stock agencies and stock photographers have been 
advertising on the Web.  (Transactions have been done by traditional, 
over-the-phone price negotiations followed by manual prepayment 
through credit card, invoicing or purchase orders.)  Last month, I 
mentioned West Stock's introduction of their new World Wide Web site 
called "Muse," which offers a searchable on-line database of digital 
photographs and quick loading of lower and medium resolution images.  
Earlier this year, Index Stock already pioneered on-line transactions 
on CompuServe, a commercial on-line service. Index Stock's on-line 
database, Photos To Go, offers medium-resolution images (about 2 MB) 
for personal and in-house use in the $15 to $20 price range.  
According to Index Stock's Kathy Mullins, "West Stock's Muse site 
appears to be offering high-quality, 'catalog' grade images. In 
contrast, we've kept our Photos To Go images separate from our 
premium line of catalog images."

Muse provides two on-line resolutions for previewing:  A thumbnail 
image and watermarked JPEC image that is about 3.5" x 5" at 72 dpi.  
Images for lease are offered in the 1.1 MB size and the 4.5 MB size, 
which are similar to Kodak PhotoCD's "Base" resolution and "BaseX4" 
resolutions, respectively.  Muse offers "affordable pricing" in five 
categories:  Personal ($8-$15); internal Business Printed, i.e. 
newsletters ($15-$46); external Business Printed, i.e. brochures 
($20-$70); non-resale Electronic, i.e. Web pages or presentations 
($25-$30); and resale Electronic, i.e. interactive CD-ROM software 
($40-$45).

Picture Network International (PNI) has been operating a commercial 
on-line site for about two years.  Besides offering over 350,000 
images from 40 suppliers (mostly stock agencies), their Publishers 
Depot site also offers works of art (from Christies of the UK), 
historical images, illustrations and type fonts.  PNI has been 
securing digital images and electronic-use rights (with contracts 
lasting up to seven years) from many top stock agencies over the past 
two years.  Now they are offering 5-year interactive CD-ROM licenses 
for as low as $40, for production runs under 20,000; and Publishing 
on Demand (under 5,000 copies) for as low as $30 (18 megabyte files 
are $100).  Although PNI does not offer instant transactions like 
West Stock's Muse site, they claim to provide delivery by writeable 
CD-ROM or on-line delivery within 24 hours.

COPYRIGHT:

Can you use elements of a work you do not own if what you produce 
isn't recognizable as derived from the original work?

Copyright does not protect a work's ideas, processes, or systems.  
Anyone is free to copy those elements.  Only the "expression" in a 
work is protected.

However, if protected "expression" elements of a photo are copied and 
then transformed by the copier into something that is not 
recognizable as the original work, technically, this is still 
copyright infringement (because it is an unauthorized exercise of the 
copyright owner's exclusive reproduction right - even if the copy has 
been transformed into something very different.)  In addition, 
transforming the copy to a new and different work may also be an 
infringement of the copyright owner's exclusive right to modify the 
protected work.

Practically speaking, though, it can be both costly and difficult for 
the copyright owner  to prove infringement in this type of case.  
Copyright infringement is generally established in court by proving 
that the defendant's work is "substantially similar" to the 
copyrighted work.  If the copyright owner's work and the defendant's 
work are not similar, the copyright owner will not be able to prove 
infringement unless the defendant actually admits to having copied 
the protected work.

Phd Technology
KEEP IT TO ONE FINGER


There's a marketing truism: "If you want to live with the masses, 
sell to the classes; if you want to live with the classes, sell to 
the masses."  Applying this to camera production, vendors have 
learned that indeed the megabucks are with mass products for the 
general consumer, not the showcase elite products aimed at 
professionals.

As we move into digital delivery of pictures, however, I see 
manufacturers ignoring this time-tested axiom.

In the race to capture the Digital Image Industry (and it must be an 
important one if Apple, Microsoft, Kodak, Fuji, Sony, IBM, and all 
the other brothers have jumped in), I will make a prediction that the 
technology that will win out, will be Phd Technology.  (Phd = Push 
Here Dummy).

Every bell and whistle you add to something makes it more complicated 
for the operator.  When sales dip, manufacturers put their engineers 
to work to simplify, simplify, and make equipment easier to use.  
We've seen this happen in our generation with cameras, automobiles, 
and telephones.

As photographers move onto the I-Way, computer technology will no 
doubt give way to Interactive Video technology, with all the latter's 
one finger 'touch screen' push-button ease of operation.  If you plan 
on providing a service for photobuyers on the I-Way you'll appeal to 
them and win over the competition if your buyers can reach you with 
one finger (digit). -RE

A WORKABLE SYSTEM


We all like to avoid work.  Unfortunately, few endeavors exist that 
don't entail some work.

"Stay out of my darkroom!" the photographer says.  Or, "Stay out of 
my kitchen!" the chef says.  What they are saying to us is, "I've 
developed a routine.  I, alone, understand it.  I know where 
everything is.  If you come in and disturb my routine -- you'll make 
more work for me."

Since the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of most of the activities 
we involve ourselves in -- housekeeping, driving daily to work, child 
rearing, marketing our photo illustrations -- we find ourselves 
attempting to develop a system to get through the nitty gritty tasks 
that contribute to the success of the main endeavor.  A system, once 
we perfect it, eventually becomes a habit.  As the saying goes, "You 
can get used to anything."  Once we form the habit (even the task of 
meeting the rush hour traffic) it eases the pain.  The unpleasantness 
of tasks we must accomplish in order to `get through the day' can 
always be eased by developing a system that works for you.

Some of us "develop" our `systems' by leaving ourselves to the mercy 
of chance.  We let outside pressures ("do it or else") or inside 
pressures ("I am consumed by my desires") take over.  We sometimes 
succeed despite the odds. The burn-out rate associated with this 
approach is high, however.

A system, to be good, has to be tempered.  A very dear friend of 
mine, a German photographer, who introduced me to the camera back in 
1956, was a perfectionist in his photography and his darkroom.  Not 
even his wife was allowed to be present when he was working.  He 
served up a stress-filled life for himself, and his heart attack in 
1975 was not a surprise.  Another friend, a brilliant photographer 
who coached me in photo illustration back in 1964, allowed inner 
pressures to build intolerably and he took his own life in 1981.  A 
system has to be tempered.

Unfortunately, much press is given to the artist with a cataclysmic 
lifestyle whose angst is supposedly the source of his genious. 
Successful artists who have had happy childhoods and create a 
healthful and smooth lifestyle don't make for interesting reading.  
But there are hundreds of chipper and balanced artists out there who 
can serve as role models - and examples of having hammered out their 
own systems for success in living as well as their art.

Because you have been blessed (or plagued!) with the gift of 
creativity, you have the added challenge of working out a system not 
only for your personal family situation, but your life of creativity 
as well.  Over the years, I have observed that the majority of 
artists who survive intact are not those who got there by sheer 
`talent,' or who moved forward mainly on the nervous energy of their 
"burning desire" (both elements are, of course, important) -- but 
rather those who tempered these elements into a manageable lifestyle 
and built a system that worked, for them.
