<H3>Report Card</H3>
<HR>

<P>
In the Case Studies, all of these assessments are brought together
as one table. It is to be read and interpreted like a report card
with the exception that the score for each disturbance factor
is relative only for that factor. It was meant to compare between
landcover types and not across disturbance factors.
<P>
Because the relative importance of the individual disturbance
factors was large, eg clearing and fragmentation was judged to
be of far greater consequence than fire season, comparisons between
landcover types based on the total at the bottom of the table
will be misleading.
<P>
Thus, these scores are relative and not absolute numbers; there
can be no simple bottom line of the report card. Furthermore,
unlike traditional report cards, the lower the score (*) the better:
that is, the lower the score, the lower the actual and potential
landcover disturbance, and thus the lower the threat to impoverishment.
<HR>

<H4>The Scoreboard</H4>
<HR>

<P>
The purpose of generating <A HREF="tables.htm">Tables 13 - 17</A>
was to bring all the disturbance factors together simplified to
scores. These scores for each landcover type are relative within
that disturbance factor. Nonetheless, these five summaries can
be examined as a scoreboard and some interesting conclusions made.
<P>
From <A HREF="chap4b.htm#table13">Table 13</A>, it is apparent that a
high clearing score is usually matched by a high fragmentation
score. This is not an entirely surprising conclusion but it does
indicate the pervasiveness of the disturbance offered by clearing
to all landcover types within the ILZ.
<P>
In contrast, within the ELZ, <A HREF="chap4c.htm#table14">Table 14</A>,
only five of the thirty-one landcover types assessed were significantly
disturbed, five were substantially disturbed, and the remaining
nineteen were rated as slight. These large differences are generated
by the interaction of the relative areas subject to grazing and
the resilience of the landcover type to disturbance. Some landcover
types, such as the grasslands (xG), are resilient compared with
the mulga country (wS2). Furthermore, for all landcover types,
there is no correlation between the ILZ and ELZ disturbance scores.
<P>
The range of scores for tenure vulnerability is both limited and
high; <A HREF="chap4d.htm#table15">Table 15</A>. No landcover type is
well protected by tenure. This may be a somewhat surprising conclusion
given that 7% of the continent is within conservation reserves;
<A HREF="chap2c.htm#table4">Table 4</A>.
<P>
The density distribution of the four feral animal species varies
notably between landcover types; <A HREF="chap4e.htm#table16">Table 16</A>.
No single landcover type has a low or high score for all four
species.
<P>
Little comfort can be taken from this. We suspect that relationship
between feral animal density and the rate of biotic erosion is
non-linear with a low threshold; low densities are sufficient
to cause disproportionately high rates of other species loss.
<P>
Finally, the scoreboard for fire disturbance presents a contrast
between the two factors; <A HREF="chap4f.htm#table17">Table 17</A>. For
fire season, only seven landcover types have a low disturbance
score, with the majority being assessed as moderate. In contrast,
the fire frequency score is assessed as low for the majority of
types. The extremes of these two disturbance factors are not correlated:
no landcover type has a low or high score for both fire season
and fire frequency. <HR>
