The department's research centers on the processes involved in the development of behavior and its underlying biological systems. We aim to understand more precisely how natural events and behaviors affect the course of normal development, and how certain experiences can produce aberrant responses that constitute models of clinical conditions. Projects range from molecular genetic studies of gene expression for a peptide regulating salt appetite in rats to linguistic analysis of cues enabling human infants to recognize their own mothers' voices within hours of birth. Thus, we hope to describe mechanisms at several different levels of organization that determine the expression of genetic potential as this is influenced by the environment. The most pervasive early environment for humans and most other mammals is the mother-infant relationship. Many departmental projects are devoted to understanding the behavioral and physiological processes at work within that relationship. Knowledge of these processes is essential for a clear understanding of how the expression of genetic potential is regulated by the environment of early life and, in turn, how these experiences influence the risk for the expression of anxiety disorders, cardiovascular disease, and vulnerability to mental illness under stress later in life.

<B>Fetal Behavior and Intrauterine Influences</B>  Following his discovery that a newborn baby recognizes and prefers her/his own mother's voice within a few hours of birth, Dr. Fifer, in collaboration with Dr. Myers, has extended these observations into a program of research on fetal responses to sound and to maternal emotional state, and on preterm development of sleep-wake state organization. Together, Drs. Fifer, Myers, and Yongue have been funded to incorporate these approaches in a study of early markers of risk for Sudden Infant Death and other neurological disorders. This project involves a mutually beneficial technology exchange between the sophisticated research environment of New York State Psychiatric Institute and the high risk rural populations in the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.

With funding from a new National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) grant, Drs. Hutchings and Zmitrovich have developed the first valid animal model for studying the developmental effects on the offspring of pregnant mothers who have been given methadone maintenance treatment. With a new post-doctoral fellow, E'mett Williams, they are now extending this work to the study of buprenorphine, a novel therapeutic compound for the treatment of heroin addiction in order to determine its safety for use during pregnancy.

<B>The Early Development of Motivational Systems</B>  Dr. Barr's research focuses on the neural circuitry that mediates the functional effects of opioid peptides and opiate drugs. He is mapping the neural substrates for opiate induced analgesia and opiate induced reward to determine how those substrates change during normal pre- and postnatal development. Most recently, he and his co-workers have begun to describe in detail the opiate abstinence syndrome that is seen in the neonatal rat following chronic treatment with opiate drugs. Understanding the physiological mechanisms of that syndrome will aid in our understanding of the effects of prenatal exposure of human infants to heroin and methadone.

Dr. Myers has found further evidence of important linkages between feeding behavior in infancy and certain longterm developmental effects individual of variation in this basic behavior of neonates. In studies of newborn human infants, he and his colleagues have found an unexpected relationship between high birth weight and reduced cardiovascular reactivity during feeding. In rat studies, he has gathered evidence that the longterm consequences of rapid weight gain early in life on obesity and hypertension are more pronounced in males. Investigations of the mechanisms underlying these findings are ongoing.

Dr. Yongue continued his work on neural mechanisms underlying the ingestive behavior and cardiovascular function of inbred strains of rats. In the past year, his work has focused on findings from his laboratory that fetal neural grafts from a genetic hypertensive strain alter blood pressure and ingestive behavior in normotensive hosts. In addition, Drs. Yongue and Resit Canbeyli continued their investigations of neuroendocrine differences in salt appetite during early development in genetic hypertensive and normotensive rats.

<B>Early Separation Anxiety</B>  Drs. Hofer, Brunelli, Shair, and Carden are studying the psychobiological mechanisms by which separation of young rats from their home nest, siblings, and mother induces a high rate of separation calling. They have found that this infant behavior responds (selectively) to drugs that alleviate or that produce severe anxiety in human adults. Thus, the brain systems involved appear to be remarkably similar to those thought to be responsible for human anxiety disorders. Dr. Brunelli completed initial studies on a genetically diverse strain of rats (N:NIH) that are now being selectively bred for high and for low levels of isolation distress calling during infancy. This line of work investigates the association of early separation distress with adult measures of anxiety, as a model for the development and inheritance of anxiety disorders. Dr. Carden has shown that the three different types of opioid receptors begin to contribute specifically to certain isolation and attachment behaviors of rat pups as soon as three days after birth. She has been able to measure differences in brain opioid levels (met-enkephalin) as a result of isolation, providing a potential link between attachment and brain mechanisms of reward.

<B>An Animal Model of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)</B>  Two major difficulties in combating the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome are identifying which infants are at greatest risk for this devastating phenomenon, and predicting when these events might occur. Home monitoring of infants thought to be at risk has proved expensive and ineffectual. In our animal model of SIDS, Drs. Shair, Myers, and Hofer have recently found that, prior to experimental manipulation, high heart rate is a predictor of susceptibility to unexpected mortality. After our experimental procedures, low heart rate predicts impending death. These results show how animal models can suggest complex and unimagined patterns that may underlie the difficulties in predicting risk of human disease.

The department continues to play a central role in an NIMH-funded Research Training Program for postdoctoral fellows in the Psychobiological Sciences, directed by Dr. Hofer. The 20 faculty members represent five other departments from Psychiatric Institute and the Perinatology Division of the Pediatrics department at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students from Columbia, Hunter College, and several other universities conduct research and receive training in the department. Dr. Jonathan Polan, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Cornell, began a two-year advanced research training fellowship in this department with funding from the Reader's Digest Foundation .
