U.S. APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS LANDMARK VERDICT IN TOBACCO TRIAL

The Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a precedent-
setting jury verdict in a product liability suit against tobacco
manufacturers, setting aside the $400,000 award and sending the case
back because of errors it found in conduct of the trial.

The 87-page verdict opened some new avenues of argument
for plaintiff's attorneys and reinstated two tobacco companies as
defendants. But its temporary effect, at least, was to maintain the
industry's unbroken string of victories in product liability suits
brought by smokers and their families.

The verdict was returned in 1988 in a suit by Antonio Cipollone,
widower of Rose Cipollone, who died of cancer in 1984 at the age of
58 after more than four decades of smoking.

Like the trial judge, the appeals court accepted a distinction
between tobacco companies' liability before and after 1966, when the
government began requiring warnings of health hazards on packs. But
interpretations differed on several points.

At the trial, only the Liggett Group Inc. was found liable because
before 1966 Rose Cipollone smoked only one of its brands. Phillip
Morris Inc. and Lorillard Inc. were dismissed as defendants because
she smoked their cigarettes after that period.

And the jury returned a verdict only for Antonio Cipollone, not
Rose's estate, because it found her principally responsible for her
own injury.

The appellate court overturned U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin on
both counts.

Elements of the Third Circuit's decision:

* To prevail on the theory known as express warranty, plaintiffs'
attorneys must prove not only that tobacco companies ran pre-1966
advertisements implying that smoking wasn't harmful but also that the
plaintiff relied on those representations.

Rose Cipollone's reliance on the ads cannot be presumed but must be
proved, the court said, and Liggett's lawyers should have the chance
to prove that Rose Cipollone either was unaware of the ads or didn't
believe their message.

"The advertising constituted an express warranty...as long as Mr.
Cipollone can prove that Mrs. Cipollone was aware of the
advertisements and as long as Liggett does not prove that she
disbelieved them," the appellate court ruled.

Sarokin had ruled that it was enough to show that the commercials
were in public use, and it was this ruling upon which the $400,000
award to Antonio Cipollone was based.

* New Jersey's comparative fault law mitigating the manufacturers'
liability for failure to warn should be applied only to the period
before 1966.

The jury found Rose Cipollone was 80 percent responsible for
continuing to smoke and Liggett 20 percent responsible for failing to
warn her of the dangers, so her estate received no award.

But the appeals court ruled that the question of her responsibility
for her actions applied only to the period before warning labels were
required, rather than to her entire life.

"The jury should have been instructed that Mrs. Cipollone's post-1965
conduct bore only on the apportionment of damages, but not on her
comparative fault for her own injuries," the court said.

* The doctrine of inherent characteristics, which holds that
manufacturers cannot be sued if the product's defects are both
inherent and well known, applies only to the period after 1966.

For alleged injuries occurring before that period, a jury can decide
the facts on whether the average person can be expected to know about
the dangers of smoking and, if not, whether a company should be held
liable for defects of a product because its risks outweighed its
benefits.

Sarokin had ruled that the doctrine applied to the years before 1966
and thus barred recovery from Liggett for health effects due to the
design of the cigarettes.

The appeals court rejected Liggett's claim there was insufficient
evidence to prove that smoking the company's cigarettes caused the
cancer.

"The jury could have reasonably concluded...that Mrs. Cipollone's
smoking from 1952 to 1966...caused her lung cancer," the court said.

Both plaintiffs' and defense attorneys claimed victory.

"We repeatedly stated that the verdict was wrong and would be
reversed on appeal," said Liggett General Counsel Josiah Murray.

Plaintiffs' attorney Cynthia Walters expressed pleasure in the
decision, even though it overturned the $400,000 award.

"From our standpoint, we won beyond dispute on two areas of great
concern," she said.

U.S. JUDGE RULES OUT PUNITIVE DAMAGES FOR FLIGHT 103 VICTIMS

U.S. District Judge Thomas J. Platt of New York ruled
Jan. 3 that an international agreement bars families of victims of
the 1988 bombing of Pan American Flight 103 from suing the airline
for punitive damages.

The ruling "adds insult to injury in today's world," Platt said, but
the Warsaw Convention covering international flights limits relief to
compensatory damages.

He said "it is simply not within this court's power to construe the
treaty in a manner inconsistent with the contracting parties'
expectations."

Central to the plaintiffs' case is a charge that Pan Am received a
warning of a bomb threat but neither increased security adequately
nor notified passengers of the risk.

Many of the 259 victims on the plane were American college students
studying abroad who were returning home for the Christmas vacation.

Flight 103, en route from Germany to the United States, blew up over
Lockerbie, Scotland, apparently as the result of a terrorist bomb.

Suits brought by families across the country have been consolidated
into one proceeding in the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn.

Of more than 150 plaintiffs involved, 95 are represented by the New
York law firm of Kreindler & Kreindler, which specializes in aviation
litigation.

The firm's Lee Kreindler indicated there will be an appeal of Judge
Platt's ruling.

"I don't think this is the last word on it," he said.

The Warsaw Convention limits compensatory damages to $75,000 unless
willful misconduct is proven. It doesn't explicitly address punitive
damages, but Platt said the ban is implicit.

"While the Warsaw Convention does not expressly refer to punitive
damage claims, it appears that the Warsaw Convention bars such claims
whether or not willful misconduct exists," he said.

He said those who drew up the treaty in 1929 had a "shared
expectation" of setting "some uniform limit on an airline carrier's
liability in order to promote the civil aviation industry which at
the time of the Warsaw Convention was in its infancy."

"I think the judge was eminently correct in his decision," said James
M. Shaughnessy, a lawyer for Pan Am.

He added that he is not worried about an appeal.

Pan Am argues that it was prohibited by the U.S. government from
notifying passengers of the bomb threat.

The ruling in New York doesn't affect a case being brought against
Pan Am in the Florida courts by families of British passengers and
the 11 persons who were killed on the ground when the jet crashed in
Lockerbie.

"This group specifically chose to pursue our cases through the
Florida courts since it was felt that there would be a better change
of establishing punitive damages through the Florida courts than in
New York," spokesman Peter Watson said in London.

TAIWAN GOVERNMENT HELD LIABLE IN JOURNALIST'S SLAYING

The government of Taiwan can be held liable for its role in the
California slaying of a journalist and critic of the regime, the
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held Dec. 29.

Henry Liu was shot and killed in Daly City, Calif., on orders of Vice
Adm. Wong Hsi-ling, then director of Taiwan's Defense Intelligence
Bureau. But Taiwan claimed Wong was acting outside his official
duties and had a personal grudge against Liu.

Several of those involved in the scheme, including Wong, were
convicted of murder in Taiwan, and one was convicted in California.

Liu's wife, Helen, filed a wrongful death action against the
government of Taiwan.

Overturning a lower court, the Ninth Circuit said she could proceed.

"Wong's act of ordering the assassination of Henry Liu was not wholly
personal but arose from his employment as director of the DIB," the
appellate panel said.

"When an employee, such as Wong, uses governmental authority in a
mistaken attempt to benefit his employer by silencing an outspoken
critic of the government, there is nothing inequitable about
spreading the loss among all the beneficiaries of the government."

Judge Robert Boochever also wrote that holding Taiwan accountable
wouldn't interfere with formation of foreign policy by the executive
branch of the U.S. government.

John Martel, an attorney for Taiwan, said he would review the
decision and consider an apepal.

He said the government of Taiwan "was as appalled as anyone" by the
killing "and there is no proof that the government had anything to do
with it."

CALIFORNIA PUNITIVE DAMAGES UP SINCE 1987, TORT REFORMERS SAY

The average amount of punitive damages awarded by California juries
has risen by 178 percent since 1987 alone, according to a study by
the Association for California Tort Reform.

The average award for punitive damages in 1989 was
$3.01 million, up from $1.69 million in 1987, the group reported.

The study was based on a review of 1,846 jury verdicts reported by
Jury Verdicts Weekly.

It found 48 punitive damage awards of $1 million or more and 19
awards of $5 million or more.

At the same time, the number of awards is down, from 15.2 percent in
1987 to 9.3 percent in 1989.

Tort reformers say that's because of a change in the law and
increased willingness of defendants to settle.

Victor Schwartz of the Washington, D.C., law firm of Crowell &
Moring, a specialist in torts, noted that in 1987 California raised
its standard of proof for punitive damages from preponderance of the
evidence to clear and convincing evidence.

In addition, he said, "many punitive damage cases are being channeled
into settlement" because punitive damages "are constantly being used
as a threat by plaintiffs' lawyers, and many defendants prefer
settlement to the Russian roulette system of punitive damage
litigation."

The study's findings were presented last month to the California
Legislature's Joint Committee on Tort Liability.

"This study indicates that the threat of punitive damages is a real
and major concern for the business community of California," said
Frank Schubert, president of the Association for California Tort
Reform.

"When one out of ten jury verdicts is likely to result in a punitive
damage award averaging more than $3 million, it is not difficult to
understand why business leaders are leery of California's legal
climate.

"It is a major reason why California is slowly losing its competitive
edge to less litigious international competitors."

FLORIDA SUPREME COURT FINDS INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER SELF-DEFENSE

The Florida Supreme Court ruled Dec. 21 that a clause common to
homeowners' insurance policies bars coverage for policyholders who
injure assailants in their homes in self-defense.

State law authorizes individuals to use force in self-defense, the
court acknowledged, and self-defense is a "worthy" motive for causing
injury.

Self-defense is nevertheless an intentional act and thus excluded
from coverage under a clause barring claims for intentional acts, the
court held in a 5-2 decision.

The case arose from an incident in which Edward Marshall shot his ex-
wife's son after the younger man broke into the house. A jury said
Marshall acted negligently and awarded the son $575,000 in
compensatory and punitive damages.

State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., which wrote the policy, refused to
pay the claim.

The court's unsigned majority opinion said clauses excluding coverage
for intentional acts are non-negotiable elements of most homeowners'
liability policies.

Allowing coverage of intenational acts, even in self-defense, would
skew actuarial tables and encourage individuals to commit wrongful
acts, the court said.

"We will not rewrite a policy under these circumstances to provide
coverage where the clear language of the policy does not; nor will we
invoke public policy to override this otherwise valid contract," the
majority said.

Justices Parker Lee McDonald and Rosemary Barkett dissented, saying
they would side with courts in other states that ruled acts of self-
defense are not the sort of intentional acts that would be
consciously undertaken by a homeowner because he or she is aware of
insurance against liability.

"It would be ironic to exonerate an individual on the basis of self-
defense but deny him insurance coverage of the costs of defense; yet
allow insurance coverage to a person who negligently causes injury,"
McDonald wrote.

FLORIDA COMMISSIONER CHARGES LAWYERS WITH INSURANCE FRAUD

Nine persons including two lawyers have been charged with
racketeering in a scheme to defraud insurance companies with false
medical claims, Florida Insurance Commission Tom Gallagher charged
Dec. 22.

Those charged included Mark Marks, 64, head of a law firm with
offices in Miami, North Miami, Pompano Beach and Fort Lauderdale, and
his son Gary, 32.

Prosecutors charged that the pair arranged for medical tests from the
Center for Neurological Services in Fort Lauderdale and dictated both
what the test results and the bills for the service should be.

They said employees of the law firm were told to alter or conceal
clients' medical records to provide false information to insurance
companies.

Those who cooperated allegedly shared up to thousands of dollars from
a fee-sharing fund.

Gallagher called the operation "an outrageous example of a criminal
conspiracy" designed to "cheat insurance companies out of millions of
dollars."

"The insurance companies were the biggest target, but the people are
the real victims," he said.

"Every lost dollar in insurance gets passed on to the public in the
form of more expensive insurance premiums."

PENNSYLVANIA COURT HOLDS UNION ISN'T LIABLE FOR STRIKE VIOLENCE

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Jan. 3 that the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters isn't liable for damages over violence in a
1977 strike against Freeport Transport Co.

The court said liability of Teamsters Local 538 was clear, but said
evidence didn't prove the international union was involved.

The high court upheld the trial court's judgment of $51,753 in
compensatory damages against the local and the international but
struck down an award of $250,000 in punitive damages against the
international.

Testimony showed that the international union said strike-related
violence would end if amnesty were provided one striker, Jack
Robison. Dissenting Justice John Flaherty said that was enough to
prove union involvement but the majority disagreed.

Robison was later convicted on criminal charges stemming from strike
violence.

"The appearance of a representative of the international in an effort
to end a strike does not mean that the IBT approved or encouraged the
violence during the strike," the court said.

It said the Pennsylvania Labor Anti-Injunctrion Act requires "a
higher showing than the common law rules of agency to establish a
union's liability."

PENNSYLVANIA COURT BARS WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT OVER PREMATURE TRIPLETS

A three-judge panel of Pennsylvania Superior Court has upheld a lower
court's ruling that a wrongful-death suit cannot be filed in the case
of triplets who were born prematurely.

"In the absence of any expression of intent from the Legislature or
any analysis by our Supreme Court, we cannot decide that fetuses born
prior to attaining viability should now be accorded the same rights
that children who have attained viability have been accorded under
the Wrongful Death and Survival Acts," the court said.

Michael and Ann Hudak conceded that their triplets weren't viable
after their premature birth. But they alleged that a group of
Williamsport doctors was negligent in failing to provide proper
treatment to stop premature labor.

UTAH SUPREME COURT HOLDS CITY, COUNTY & STATE LIABLE FOR FLOODING

The Utah Supreme Court has ruled that the city and county of Salt
Lake and state of Utah can be sued over failure to maintain a
culvert, resulting in flood damage to several stores in 1983.

A district court judge had dismissed the case on grounds of
government immunity. But the state's highest court unanimously held
that the immunity applied to policy decisions, and failure to clean
the culvert was an operational decision that didn't necessarily
follow established policy.

The Legislature passed legislation later in 1983 extending government
immunity to flood control, but the Supreme Court ruled that it wasn't
retroactive.

WASHINGTON SUPREME COURT RULES INSURERS MUST PAY FOR WASTE CLEANUP

The Washington State Supreme Court ruled Jan. 4 that insurers for the
Boeing Co. and several other corporations must help their
policyholders pay for cleaning up hazardous waste.

The decision was the latest in a string of court disputes over
whether cleanup costs are "damages" as the term is used in standard
comprehensive general liability coverage.

In its 7-2 ruling, the Washington court said they were.

The suit arose over cleanup of a land owned by Western Processing in
Kent, Wash. A major site for hazardous industrial waste for many
years, it was put on the original Environmental Protection Agency
list for Superfund cleanup.

On one side are Boeing, which said it's spent $40 million on the
cleanup; Northwest Steel Rolling Mills, Inc.; RSR Corp.; John Fluke
Manufacturing Co., Inc., and Davis Walker Corp.

They were notified in 1983 that, as generators of waste at the site,
they were responsible for costs of cleaning it up. They agreed to do
so in a consent decree entered in 1987.

In turn, they sought indemnification from their insurers: Aetna
Casualty & Surety Co., Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., Granite State
Insurance Co., American Centennial Insurance Co. and Hartford
Accident & Indemnity Co.

The suit was filed in federal court, which certified the question of
insurance company liability under Washington law to the state Supreme
Court.

Writing for the court, Justice Fred Dore gave short shrift to
insurers' arguments that cleanup costs ordered by government aren't
damages.

"Response costs in response to actual releases of hazardous wastes"
are damages within the meaning of the insurance policies at issue, he
said.

"The reported decisions across the country, the lay dictionary, the
insurance dictionary, the failure of the insurance industry to write
down what it meant, each of these facts lay waste to insurers'
argument," Dore said.

But the majority said the term doesn't cover safety measures or other
preventive costs taken in advance of any damage to property.

Chief Justice Keith Callow wrote a dissent in which he said the
majority ruling "upsets settled rules of insurance construction,
violates controlling precedent, and contravenes public policy."

LAWYER ATTACKS IDEA OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL TRUST FUND

Legal Times published an opinion article in its Dec. 18-25 issue
attacking the proposal of Maurice Greenberg, president of American
International Group, for a National Environmental Trust Fund to pay
for cleaning high-priority hazardous waste sites.

"Greenberg's proposal, if enacted into law, would allow the insurance
industry to escape part or all of its massive contractual liablity to
private- and public-sector policyholders for environ-mental cleanup,"
Peter Kalis wrote in the legal news weekly published in Washington,
D.C.

Kalis is a partner in the Pittsburgh firm of Kirkpatrick & Lockart
who represents manufacturers in their disputes with insurers.

Greenberg's proposed fund would be financed by a tax on all
commercial and industrial property/casualty insurance policies, as
well as equivalent fees paid by self-insured corporations.

In suggesting it last March, he argued that most pollution of soil
and ground water "did not result from deliberate, conscious acts" but
is "the residue of progress." Because all U.S. society benefited, he
said, we have a common interest in cleaning up.

But Kalis argued that comprehensive general liability insurance "was
marketed (and purchased) as a wholesale external-ization of risk, and
one of the risks insured against was the possibility that the lgeal
system would change and casue policy-holders to incur new types of
liability for property damage and bodily injury...

"One must wonder about the constitutional consequences of
congressional nullification of the contractual entitlements of
thousands of policyholders in order to effect an anticipated bailout
of the insurance industry."
