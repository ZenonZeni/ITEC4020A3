<H2>Utility-Scale PV</H2>
<p><strong>A Niche for PV</strong>

<p>Despite the costs, utilities are becoming more involved with PV. For example,
a joint venture was formed between DOE, the Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI), and several utilities. Called
Photovoltaics for Utility-Scale Applications (PVUSA), the project
operates three <a href="utilitycase.html">pilot test stations</a> in
different parts of the country for utility-scale PV systems. These
pilot projects allow utilities to experiment with newly developing
PV technologies with little financial risk. 

<p>In another experiment, utilities are exploring connecting PV
systems to the utility grid in locations where they have a higher
value. For example, adding PV generation near where the
electricity is used prevents the energy losses associated with
sending current long distances through conventional power lines.
This makes the PV system worth more to the utility when it is
located near the customer. 

<p>PV systems could also be installed at locations in the utility
distribution system that are servicing areas whose populations are
growing rapidly. Placed in these locations, the PV systems could
eliminate the need for the utility to increase the size of the
power lines and servicing area. Installing PV systems near other
utility distribution equipment such as substations can also
prevent overloading the equipment in the substation.
