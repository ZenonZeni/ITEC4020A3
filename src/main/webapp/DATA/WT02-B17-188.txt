<H2>Solar Water Heating </H2>

<P>
This publication provides basic informa-tion on the components
and types of solar water heaters currently available and the economic
and environmental benefits of owning a system. Although the publica-tion
does not provide information on building and installing your own
system, it should help you discuss solar water heating systems
intelligently with a solar equipment dealer.
<P>
Solar water heaters, sometimes called solar domestic hot water
systems, may be a good investment for you and your family. Solar
water heaters are cost competitive in many applications when
you account for the total energy costs over the life of the system.
Although the initial cost of solar water heaters is higher than
that of conventional water heaters, the fuel (sunshine) is free.
Plus, they are environmentally friendly. To take advantage of
these heaters, you must have an unshaded, south-facing location
(a roof, for example) on your property.
<P>
These systems use the sun to heat either water or a heat-transfer
fluid, such as a water-glycol antifreeze mixture, in collectors
generally mounted on a roof. The heated water is then stored in
a tank similar to a conventional gas or electric water tank. Some
systems use an electric pump to circulate the fluid through the
collectors. Solar Water Heating
<P>
Solar water heaters can operate in any climate. Performance varies
depending, in part, on how much solar energy is available at
the site, but also on how cold the water coming into the system
is. The colder the water, the more efficiently the system operates.
In almost all climates, you will need a conventional backup system.
In fact, many building codes require you to have a conventional
water heater as the backup.
<P>
<B>First Things First</B> 
<P>
Before investing in any solar energy system, it is more cost
effective to invest in making your home more energy efficient.
Taking steps to use less hot water and to lower the temperature
of the hot water you use reduces the size and cost of your solar
water heater.
<P>
Good first steps are installing low-flow showerheads or flow restrictors
in shower heads and faucets, insulating your current water heater,
and insulating any hot water pipes that pass through unheated
areas. If you have no dishwasher, or your dishwasher is equipped
with its own automatic water heater, lower the thermostat on
your water heater to 120&#161;F (49&#161;C). For more information
on ways to use less energy for water heating, contact The Energy
Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse (EREC&Ntilde;see
Source List at the end of this publication).
<P>
You'll also want to make sure your site has enough available sunshine
to meet your needs efficiently and economically. Your local solar
equipment dealer can perform a solar site analysis for you or
show you how to do your own. You can also contact EREC for more
information.
<P>
Remember: Local zoning laws or covenants may restrict where you
can place your collectors. Check with your city, county, and homeowners
association to find out about any restrictions.
<P>
<B>Solar Water Heater Basics</B> 
<P>
Solar water heaters are made up of collectors, storage tanks,
and, depending on the system, electric pumps.
<P>
There are basically three types of collectors: flatplate, evacuated-tube,
and concentrating. A <B>flatplate</B> <B>collector</B>, the
most common type, is an insulated, weather-proofed box containing
a dark absorber plate under one or more transparent or translucent
covers.
<P>
<B>Evacuated-tube collectors</B> are made up of rows of parallel,
transparent glass tubes. Each tube consists of a glass outer tube
and an inner tube, or absorber, covered with a selective coating
that absorbs solar energy well but inhibits radiative heat loss.
The air is withdrawn (&Ograve;evacuated&Oacute;) from the space
between the tubes to form a vacuum, which eliminates conductive
and convective heat loss.
<P>
<B>Concentrating collectors</B> for residential applications are
usually parabolic troughs that use mirrored surfaces to concentrate
the sun's energy on an absorber tube (called a receiver) containing
a heat-transfer fluid. For more information on solar collectors,
contact EREC.
<P>
Most commercially available solar water heaters require a well-insulated
storage tank. Many systems use converted electric water heater
tanks or plumb the solar storage tank in series with the conventional
water heater. In this arrangement, the solar water heater preheats
water before it enters the conventional water heater.
<P>
Some solar water heaters use pumps to recirculate warm water from
storage tanks through collectors and exposed piping. This is generally
to protect the pipes from freezing when outside temperatures drop
to freezing or below.
<P>
<B>Types of Solar Water Heaters</B> 
<P>
Solar water heaters can be either active or passive. An active
system uses an electric pump to circulate the heat-transfer fluid;
a passive system has no pump. The amount of hot water a solar
water heater produces depends on the type and size of the system,
the amount of sun available at the site, proper installation,
and the tilt angle and orientation of the collectors.
<P>
Solar water heaters are also characterized as open loop (also
called &quot;direct&quot;) or closed loop (also called &quot;indirect&quot;).
An open-loop system circulates household (potable) water through
the collector. A closed-loop system uses a heat-transfer fluid
(water or diluted antifreeze, for example) to collect heat and
a heat exchanger to transfer the heat to household water.
<P>
<B>Active Systems</B> 
<P>
Active systems use electric pumps, valves, and controllers to
circulate water or other heat-transfer fluids through the collectors.
They are usually more expensive than passive systems but are
also more efficient. Active systems are usually easier to retrofit
than passive systems because their storage tanks do not need
to be installed above or close to the collectors. But because
they use electricity, they will not function in a power outage.
Active systems range in price from about $2,000 to $4,000 installed.
<P>
<B>Open-Loop Active Systems</B> 
<P>
Open-loop active systems use pumps to circulate household water
through the collectors. This design is efficient and lowers operating
costs but is not appropriate if your water is hard or acidic because
scale and corrosion quickly disable the system.
<P>
These open-loop systems are popular in nonfreezing climates such
as Hawaii. They should never be installed in climates that experience
freezing temperatures for sustained periods. You can install
them in mild but occasionally freezing climates, but you must
consider freeze protection.
<P>
Recirculation systems are a specific type of open-loop system
that provide freeze protection. They use the system pump to circulate
warm water from storage tanks through collectors and exposed piping
when temperatures approach freezing. Consider recirculation systems
only where mild freezes occur once or twice a year at most. Activating
the freeze protection more frequently wastes electricity and stored
heat.
<P>
Of course, when the power is out, the pump will not work and the
system will freeze. To guard against this, a freeze valve can
be installed to provide additional protection in the event the
pump doesn&Otilde;t operate. In freezing weather, the valve dribbles
warmer water through the collector to prevent freezing. Consider
recirculation systems <I>only</I> where mild freezes occur once
or twice a year at most. Activating the freeze protection more
frequently wastes electricity and stored heat.
<P>
Of course, when the power is out, the pump will not work and the
system will freeze. To guard against this, a freeze valve can
be installed to provide additional protection in the event the
pump doesn't operate. In freezing weather, the valve dribbles
warmer water through the collector to prevent freezing.
<P>
<B>Closed-Loop Active Systems</B> 
<P>
These systems pump heat-transfer fluids (usually a glycol-water
antifreeze mixture) through collectors. Heat exchangers transfer
the heat from the fluid to the household water stored in the
tanks.
<P>
Double-walled heat exchangers prevent contamination of household
water. Some codes require double walls when the heat-transfer
fluid is anything other than household water.
<P>
Closed-loop glycol systems are popular in areas subject to extended
freezing temperatures because they offer good freeze protection.
However, glycol antifreeze systems are a bit more expensive to
buy and install, and the glycol must be checked each year and
changed every 3 to 10 years, depending on glycol quality and system
temperatures.
<P>
Drainback systems use water as the heat-transfer fluid in the
collector loop. A pump circulates the water through the collectors.
The water drains by gravity to the storage tank and heat exchanger;
there are no valves to fail. When the pumps are off,the collectors
are empty, which assures freeze protection and also allows the
system to turn off if the water in the storage tank becomes too
hot.
<P>
<B>Pumps in Active Systems</B> 
<P>
The pumps in solar water heaters have low power requirements,
and some companies now include direct current (DC) pumps powered
by small solar-electric (photovoltaic, or PV) panels. PV panels
convert sunlight into DC electricity. Such systems cost nothing
to operate and continue to function during power outages.
<P>
<B>Passive Systems</B> 
<P>
Passive systems move household water or a heat-transfer fluid
through the system without pumps. Passive systems have no electric
components to break. This makes them generally more reliable,
easier to maintain, and possibly longer lasting than active systems.
<P>
Passive systems can be less expensive than active systems, but
they can also be less efficient. Installed costs for passive systems
range from about $1,000 to $3,000, depending on whether it is
a simple batch heater or a sophisticated thermosiphon system.
<P>
<B>Batch Heaters</B> 
<P>
Batch heaters (also known as &quot;bread box&quot; or integral
collector storage systems) are simple passive systems consisting
of one or more storage tanks placed in an insulated box that
has a glazed side facing the sun. Batch heaters are inexpensive
and have few components&Ntilde;in other words, less maintenance
and fewer failures. A batch heater is mounted on the ground or
on the roof (make sure your roof structure is strong enough to
support it). Some batch heaters use &Ograve;selective&Oacute;
surfaces on the tank(s). These surfaces absorb sun well but inhibit
radiative loss.
<P>
In climates where freezing occurs, batch heaters must either be
protected from freezing or drained for the winter. In well-designed
systems, the most vulnerable components for freezing are the pipes,
if located in uninsulated areas, that lead to the solar water
heater. If these pipes are well insulated, the warmth from the
tank will prevent freezing. Certified systems clearly state the
temperature level that can cause damage. In addition, you can
install heat tape (electrical plug-in tape to wrap around the
pipes to keep them from freezing), insulate exposed pipes, or
both. Remember, heat tape requires electricity, so the combination
of freezing weather and a power outage can lead to burst pipes.
If you live in an area where freezing is infrequent, you can use
plastic pipe that does not crack or burst when it freezes. Keep
in mind, though, that some of these pipes can&Otilde;t withstand
unlimited freeze/thaw cycles before they crack.
<P>
<B>Thermosiphon Systems</B> 
<P>
A thermosiphon system relies on warm water rising, a phenomenon
known as natural convection, to circulate water through the collectors
and to the tank. In this type of installation, the tank must be
above the collector. As water in the collector heats, it becomes
lighter and rises naturally into the tank above. Meanwhile, cooler
water in the tank flows down pipes to the bottom of the collector,
causing circulation throughout the system. The storage tank is
attached to the top of the collector so that thermosiphoning can
occur. These systems are reliable and relatively inexpensive but
require careful planning in new construction because the water
tanks are heavy. They can be freeze-proofed by circulating an
antifreeze solution through a heat exchanger in a closed loop
to heat the household water.
<P>
<B>Sizing Your System</B> 
<P>
Just as you have to choose a 30-, 40-, or 50-gallon (114-, 151-,
or 189-liter) conventional water heater, you need to determine
the right size solar water heater to install. Sizing a solar water
heater involves determining the total collector area and the
storage volume required to provide 100% of your household&Otilde;s
hot water during the summer. Solar-equipment experts use worksheets
or special computer programs to assist you in determining how
large a system you need.
<P>
Solar storage tanks are usually 50-, 60-, 80-, or 120-gallon (189-,
227-, 303-, or 454-liter) capacity. A small (50 to 60 gallon)
system is sufficient for 1 to 3 people, a medium (80-gallon) system
is adequate for a 3- or 4-person household, and a large (120-gallon)
system is appropriate for 4 to 6 people.
<P>
A rule of thumb for sizing collectors: allow about 20 square feet
(about 2 square meters) of collector area for each of the first
two family members and 8 square feet (0.7 square meter) for each
additional family member if you live in the Sun Belt. Allow 12
to 14 additional square feet (1.1 to 1.3 square meters) per person
if you live in the northern United States.
<P>
A ratio of at least 1.5 gallons (5.7 liters) of storage capacity
to 1 square foot (0.1 square meter) of collector area prevents
the system from overheating when the demand for hot water is low.
In very warm, sunny climates, experts suggest that the ratio should
be at least 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of storage to 1 square foot
(0.1 square meter) of collector area. For example, a family of
four in a northern climate would need between 64 and 68 square
feet (5.9 and 6.3 square meters) of collector area and a 96- to
102-gallon (363- to 386-liter) storage tank. (This assumes 20
square feet of collector area for the first person, 20 for the
second person, 12 to 14 for the third person, and 12 to 14 for
the fourth person. This equals 64 to 68 square feet, multiplied
by 1.5 gallons of storage capacity, which equals 96 to 102 gallons
of storage.) Because you might not be able to find a 96-gallon
tank, you may want to get a 120-gallon tank to be sure to meet
your hot water needs.
<P>
<B>Benefits of Solar Water Heaters</B> 
<P>
There are many benefits to owning a solar water heater, and number
one is economics. Solar water heater economics compare quite
favorably with those of electric water heaters, while the economics
aren&Otilde;t quite so attractive when compared with those of
gas water heaters. Heating water with the sun also means long-term
benefits, such as being cushioned from future fuel shortages
and price increases, and environmental benefits.
<P>
<B>Economic Benefits</B> 
<P>
Many home builders choose electric water heaters because they
are easy to install and relatively inexpensive to purchase. However,
research shows that an average household with an electric water
heater spends about 25% of its home energy costs on heating water.
<P>
It makes economic sense to think beyond the initial purchase price
and consider lifetime energy costs, or how much you will spend
on energy to use the appliance over its lifetime. The Florida
Solar Energy Center (FSEC&Ntilde;see Source List) studied the
potential savings to Florida homeowners of common water-heating
systems compared with electric water heaters. It found that solar
water heaters offered the largest potential savings, with solar
water-heater owners saving as much as 50% to 85% annually on their
utility bills over the cost of electric water heating.
<P>
The FSEC analysis illustrates that the initial installed cost
of the solar water heater ($1,500 to $3,000) is higher than that
of a gas water heater ($350 to $450) or an electric water heater
($150 to $350). The costs vary from region to region, so check
locally for costs in your area. Depending on the price of fuel
sources, the solar water heater can be more economical over the
lifetime of the system than heating water with electricity, fuel
oil, propane, or even natural gas because the fuel (sunshine)
is free.
<P>
However, at the current low prices of natural gas, solar water
heaters cannot compete with natural gas water heaters in most
parts of the country except in new home construction. Although
you will still save energy costs with a solar water heater because
you won&Otilde;t be buying natural gas, it won&Otilde;t be economical
on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
<P>
Paybacks vary widely, but you can expect a simple payback of 4
to 8 years on a well-designed and properly installed solar water
heater. (Simple payback is the length of time required to recover
your investment through reduced or avoided energy costs.) You
can expect shorter paybacks in areas with higher energy costs.
After the payback period, you accrue the savings over the life
of the system, which ranges from 15 to 40 years, depending on
the system and how well it is maintained.
<P>
You can determine the simple payback of a solar water heater by
first determining the net cost of the system. Net costs include
the total installed cost less any tax incentives or utility rebates.
(See the box for more information.) After you calculate the net
cost of the system, calculate the annual fuel savings and divide
the net investment by this number to determine the simple payback.
<P>
An example: Your total utility bill averages $160 per month and
your water heating costs are average (25% of your total utility
costs) at $40 per month. If you purchase a solar water heater
for $2,000 that provides an average of 60% of your hot water each
year, that system will save you $24 per month ($40 x 0.60 = $24)
or $288 per year (12 x $24 = $288). This system has a simple payback
of less than 7 years ($2,000 &Ouml; $288 = 6.9). For the remainder
of the life of the solar water heater, 60% of your hot water will
be free, saving you $288 each year. You will need to account for
some operation and maintenance costs, which are estimated at $25
to $30 a year. This is primarily to have the system checked every
3 years.
<P>
If you are building a new home or refinancing your present home
to do a major renovation, the economics are even more attractive.
The cost of including the price of a solar water heater in a new
30-year mortgage is usually between $13 and $20 per month. The
portion of the federal income tax deduction for mortgage interest
attributable to the solar system reduces that amount by about
$3 to $5 per month. If your fuel savings are more than $15 per
month, the investment in the solar water heater is profitable
immediately.
<P>
<B>Tax Incentives and Rebates</B> 
<P>
Some local or state governments offer tax incentives to encourage
residents to invest in solar energy technologies. Check with
your state or local energy office or Department of Revenue for
information. Some electric utilities offer rebates to customers
who install solar energy equipment because these installations
help utilities reduce peak loads. Peak loads are periods when
the utility must generate extra power to meet a high demand. Heating
water in the evening is one example.
<P>
<B>Long-Term Benefits</B> 
<P>
Solar water heaters offer long-term benefits that go beyond simple
economics. In addition to having free hot water after the system
has paid for itself in reduced utility bills, you and your family
will be cushioned from future fuel shortages and price increases.
You will also be doing your part to reduce this country's dependence
on foreign oil. The National Remodelers Association reports that
adding a solar water heater to an existing home raises the resale
value of the home by the entire cost of the system. You may be
able to recoup your entire investment when you sell your home.
<P>
<B>Environmental Benefits</B> 
<P>
Solar water heaters do not pollute. By investing in one, you will
be avoiding carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide,
and the other air pollution and wastes created when your utility
generates power or you burn fuel to heat your household water.
When a solar water heater replaces an electric water heater, the
electricity displaced over 20 years represents more than 50 tons
of avoided carbon dioxide emissions alone. Carbon dioxide traps
heat in the upper atmosphere, thus contributing to the &Ograve;greenhouse
effect.&Oacute;
<P>
<B>Be a Smart Consumer</B> 
<P>
Take the same care in choosing a solar water heater that you would
in the purchase of any major appliance. Your best protection
is to consider only certified and labeled systems. One such label
is put on by the Solar Rating &amp; Certification Corporation
(SRCC), a nonprofit, independent third-party organization formed
by the solar industry, state energy officials, and consumer advocates
to certify and rate solar water heaters.
<P>
A national standard (OG-300) addresses a variety of concerns,
including safety and health, durability and reliability, installation,
performance, and operation and maintenance. To meet this standard,
a system is rigorously tested. A certified solar water heater
carries the SRCC OG-300 label, and the system performance is listed
in a published directory. A similar program has been established
for Florida by FSEC. Both SRCC and FSEC provide collector testing
and rating programs.
<P>
Find out if the manufacturer offers a warranty, and, if so, what
the warranty covers and for how long. If the dealer you are buying
the equipment from goes out of business, can you get support and
parts from the manufacturer, or from a local plumbing contractor?
<P>
Make sure that the workers who are actually installing the system
are qualified to do the work. Ask the installation contractor
for references and check them. When the job is finished, have
the contractor walk you through the system so you are familiar
with the installation. And be sure that an owner&Otilde;s manual
with maintenance instructions is included as part of the package.
<P>
<B>A Bright Future</B> 
<P>
A solar water heater is a long-term investment that will save
you money and energy for many years. Like other renewable energy
systems, solar water heaters minimize the environmental effects
of enjoying a comfortable, modern lifestyle. In addition, they
provide insurance against energy price increases, help reduce
our dependence on foreign oil, and are investments in everyone&Otilde;s
future.
<P>
You might also consider other solar energy systems for your home.
Systems similar to the solar water heater are used for space heating
and swimming pool heating. In fact, pool heating is a major market
for solar energy systems. For more information on these systems,
contact EREC.
