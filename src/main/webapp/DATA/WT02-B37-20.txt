INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT REPS SPAR WITH ENVIROS OVER WASTE-ENERGY MORATORIUM

   At the latest round of Senate hearings over Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act reauthorization, representatives of industry and local
government officials strongly opposed a proposal by the environmental group
Clean Water Action that there be a moratorium on the construction of new
waste-to-energy plants until the year 2000, and that incinerator ash be
managed as a hazardous waste.
   The moratorium and incinerator ash proposals have been endorsed by a
broad coalition of national environmental groups, and legislation to
achieve those goals introduced by Rep. Peter Kostmayer (D-Pa.) has won the
endorsement of 24 House co-sponsors. However, the main Senate RCRA bill,
S. 976, sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) contains no such provisions,
and Baucus' skeptical questioning last week of the Clean Water Action
representative suggested that it is unlikely to be amended to do so.
   Dr. Henry Cole, director of science and policy for Clean Water Action,
argued that the moratorium was needed in part to confront the ''mercury
crisis in this country.'' As well, he said, waste-to-energy competes
directly with recycling for materials, and for scarce capital.
   Asked Baucus: ''Why would a moratorium be necessary if the Clean Air
Act (mercury emissions) reduction provisions'' were implemented and
enforced as called for under that law? Cole replied that he did not have
confidence EPA would effectively implement the provisions, and that,
anyway, this was not his sole reason for supporting a moratorium.
   Under questioning from Baucus, Randall Franke, representing the National
Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, and the Solid Waste
Association of North America, stated this his groups ''are equally adamant
and opposed'' to a moratorium on waste-to-energy, and the designation of
incinerator ash as hazardous. Said Franke: ''We need more options (for
solid waste management), not less.''
   AllenMoore, president of the National Solid Wastes Management
Association, said that while there had been ''temporary disruptions'' at a
few waste-to-energy facilities due to materials diversion caused by
recycling, in general there was no conflict between resource recovery and
recycling. ''You can accommodate any level of recycling,'' said Moore, as
long as waste-to-energy plants are built at the outset as part of an
integrated waste management solution.
   In his testimony, Paul Varello, deputy chair of NSWMA's Institute of
Resource Recovery, said that several recent field tests ''make clear that
municipal waste combustor ash is not a 'hazardous waste.' '' Based on
findings that incinerator ash disposed in a landfill meeting the relevant
technical standards ''presents no significant risk to human health and the
environment,'' Varello said that several provisions in S. 976 ''could be
improved.''
   Added Varello: ''Specifically, several provisions in S. 976 would
impose more stringent requirements on landfills where ash and municipal
solid waste is disposed than for landfills where only municipal solid waste
is disposed. These provisions reflect the old view that the disposal of
combined ash (bottom and fly ash) from waste combustors presents a greater
threat to human health and the environment than the disposal of municipal
solid waste. A series of recent studies suggest otherwise.''

EPA'S NEW LANDFILL REGS APPLAUDED BY NSWMA, CRITICIZED BY ENVIROS

   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's issuance September 11 of the
first comprehensive federal Subtitle-D municipal landfill standards should
''bolster confidence in landfilling'' and ''help level the playing field,''
EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said last week.
   The regs were generally applauded by industry for providing
environmental safeguards that will facilitate the construction of needed
new landfills. At the same time, the regs drew fire for their
''loopholes'' from environmentalists, whose recent lawsuit finally forced
EPA to issue the long-delayed regs when it did.
   The EPA regs, issued under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
include location, facility design and operation, groundwater monitoring,
financial responsibility, and closure requirements, in addition to cleanup
requirements for existing contamination. They are generally to take effect
24 months from publication in the Federal Register, with the exception that
ground-water monitoring and corrective action requirements are phased-in,
allowing up to five years for compliance.
   Under law, states will be required to incorporate the EPA standards into
their current state permitting programs. EPA approval of the state program
is then required, with the Agency retaining the authority to enforce its
standards in cases where a state program is not approved.
   In states with EPA-approved permitting programs, landfills must be
designed to ensure drinking water standards are not exceeded in
groundwater. States without EPA-approved programs are required to have
landfills designed with a composite liner made of synthetic material
covering a two-foot clay liner.
   At the same time, the regs provide states with approved program
flexibility to alter landfill requirements ''to accommodate the wide
variety of local conditions that exist around landfills,'' said EPA. Under
certain conditions, states with EPA-approved programs can approve
alternative landfill designs, allow use of alternative daily cover
materials, or modify the rule's 30-year post-closure care period.
   While this approach was cited by Reilly as an example of the Agency
having ''worked hard'' to reduce burdens that the rules might place on
communities, this flexibility was criticized by the Sierra Club for
enabling states to enact ''potentially weaker'' landfill and groundwater
monitoring standards. This, said the Sierra Club's Daniel Weiss, would
allow ''some landfills to evade strict groundwater protection requirements
which perpetuates the threat of drinking water contamination across the
nation."
   The Sierra Club also faulted the regs for not requiring leak detection
systems which would detect leaks before they contaminated groundwater, and
called on Congress to plug this and other loopholes.
   Allen Moore, president of the National Solid Wastes Management
Association, noted that the waste services industry ''has anxiously
awaited'' the EPA regs ''because they enumerate the measures being taken by
our industry to protect the environment and to assure public health and
safety in the land disposal of our nation's wastes.''
   Added Moore: ''Hopefully, these new regulations will be a catalyst for
eliminating the backlog that exists in some states where permitting and
siting of new disposal facilities have been halted due to a lack of federal
environmental protection standards. Now, using these new rules as a
building block, these stalled projects can proceed and we can begin siting
and developing the capacity to meet our future waste disposal needs.''
   Among other standards included in the EPA regs:
   -- Location requirements restrict the siting of new landfills near
airports and in ecologically valuable wetlands or areas subject to natural
disasters such as floodplains, fault areas and seismic zones.
   -- Operation standards include daily cover, methane gas monitoring,
stormwater controls, and programs to keep regulated hazardous waste out of
landfills.
   -- Closure and post-closure care include placing a final cover over the
landfill, final cover maintennace, groundwater and methane gas monitoring,
and leachate management for 30 years.

BFI STOCK FALLS AFTER COMPANY LOWERS 4TH-QUARTER EARNINGS PROJECTION

   Not even the publication of RCRA Subtitle-D regulations by the
Environmental Protection Agency helped stop the fall of Browning-Ferris
Industries stock, which fell nearly six points in the 10 days following the
company's prediction of lower fourth-quarter earnings.
   BFI filed an 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission Sept. 3,
estimating that its fourth-quarter earnings would be 15%-25% less than its
third-quarter earnings. Earlier the company had predicted a 10%-15% drop
over the previous quarter. Net income of 28-32 cents per share is expected
for the fourth quarter, which ends Sept. 30, down from 38 cents for the
third quarter. The company also estimates income from operations for fiscal
1991 will be 12%-15% lower than the $257 million reported for 1990.
   BFI stock dropped four points to 21-3/4 after the 8-K was filed, and had
fallen another 1-7/8 by Sept. 12, the day after Subtitle D was published.
   In the 8-K report, BFI blamed lower revenues both in the third and
fourth quarters on lower commercial waste volumes as a result of the
recession, as well as state waste minimization requirements and the
diversion of a portion of the waste stream from the company's higher margin
collections and landfill operations to the lower margin recycling
business.
   Fletcher Thorne-Thomsen, BFI's vice president for investor relations,
said the company is disappointed with the results, but he would not predict
when the company would come out of the slump, nor would he name the
number-one cause of the company's economic troubles.
   A former BFI official said that in addition to the recession a major
cause of the firm's economic problems is poor management. ''The company is
just in turmoil right now,'' he said. ''Sure business is down, but it's
still solid; and saying recycling has hurt is crazy because it saves air
space, and that air space will be worth more next year than it is today.''
   Other industry observersagree that the company has a management problem.
One analyst pointed out that, while other waste management firms are
having some financial troubles because of the recession, they are not
nearly as bad as BFI has experienced.
   However, at least one Wall Street firm--Smith Barney--has some positive
words. Analyst Ken Leung is advising his clients to buy because, ''The
stock is cheap and we think it has bottomed out.''
   Leung says BFI will clearly benefit in the long run from the new
Subtitle-D regulations, which he predicts will reduce the 6,000 existing
solid waste landfills to 2,000. He adds, however, that in the near term the
new rules may put downward pressure on disposal prices, as small landfill
owners scurry to fill existing facilities that can not meet the new
requirements.
   In other BFI news, on Sept. 4 the company declared a regular quarterly
cash dividend of 17 cents per common share of stock, payable Oct. 4. At the
same time, it announced that Frank W. Montfort would fill the newly created
office of vice president, chief quality officer. Montfort had been
divisional vice president, operations.

DELAWARE AUTHORITY PICKS ABB RESOURCE RECOVERY FOR WASTE-ENERGY PLANT

   The Delaware Solid Waste Authority Board has selected ABB (Asea Brown
Boveri) Resource Recovery Systems to start negotiations for the design,
construction and operation of a 500-ton/day waste-to-energy plant.
   The mass-burn facility will allow the authority to manage solid waste
generated as the result of future increased growth in Sussex County, said
the authority. The amount of the contract was not made public.
   ABB and two other companies, Foster Wheeler Power Systems and
Westinghouse Electric Corporation submitted ''excellent proposals for the
project,'' said an authority spokesman. The authority's staff, consultants
and board members conducted exhaustive evaluations of the three proposals,
he said.
   The general view was that any one of the three companies would do a good
job, he continued. Cleanliness of operations, technical capability,
operating experience, guarantees, economic, and financial strengths were
considerations in the selection process, said the official.
   ''ABB is a multi-national company with revenues of $27-billion and about
215,000 employees. ABB brings together the best of American, Swedish,
Swiss and German technology in a worldwide high technology company,'' said
the authority official. ABB acquired the U.S. firm of
Combustion-Engineering, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The authority
believes that ABB can provide Delaware with a state-of-the-art and
environmentally sound waste-to-energy facility, he said.
   The plant will be located at the authority's Southern Solid Waste
Management Center at Jones Crossroads, Sussex County, Delaware. Front-end
separation of materials will be accomplished through the ''Recycle
Delaware'' program, said the official. In addition, space will be
allocated for additional front-end separation in the Southern Reclamation
Plant if it becomes necessary in the future.
   The Southern Reclamation Plant will not only reduce material being
landfilled, but will also give the authority the opportunity to recycle
existing landfill space in the future. Timely completion of the plant will
be essential for assuring safe solid-waste disposal capacity in Sussex
County for several decades, said the official.
   The plant will have the best available control technology, which
includes the scrubbing of acid gases and a baghouse to remove fine
particulates. The authority will dispose of the ash from the
waste-to-energy plant in its Southern Solid Waste Management Center
landfill. With state and federal assistance and approval, the authority
will explore constructive uses for ash in order to minimize ash disposal in
the landfill, said the official.
   The waste-to-energy plant will generate approximately 15-megawatts of
electricity, according to officials at ABB, headquartered in Windsor,
Connecticut. Contract and price negotiations are expected to begin in
September and construction could begin as early as the fourth quarter of
1992. The plant will feature ABB's state-of-the-art environmental
controls, which have been subjected to rigorous testing by the U.S.
Department of Environmental Protection and its Canadian counterpart,
Environment Canada, said the official. The new facility will feature the
Combustion Engineering DeBartolomeis mass-burn grate system, proven in 79
plants around the world for 35 years, an ABB Combustion Engineering Systems
steam generator, and other ABB-manufactured products and systems.
   ''In today's market, winning this project against two quality
competitors is a significant accomplishment,'' said the ABB official.
''The Southern Reclamation Project will strengthen our company's position
in the North American waste to-energy market and enhance our stature as a
major full-service vendor.''
   ABB Resource Recovery Systems designs, builds and operates both
mass-burn and processed fuel waste-to-energy plants, including operational
facilities in Hartford, Detroit and Honolulu, and several projects
currently under development.

MIFA CLOSES $342-MILLION REFINANCING FOR SEMASS ROCHESTER EXPANSION

   The Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency (MIFA), Semass and
underwriters closed a $342-million refinancing and facilities expansion
bond issue for the shred and burn Semass Resource Recovery Facility in
Rochester, Massachusetts, said a project official.
   The Semass facility is a 52-megawatt shred and burn, waste-to-energy
resource recovery plant with a capacity of 1,900-tons of solid waste per
day. It is the largest facility of the three of its type in operation,
according to the official.
   The expansion would increase total electrical output of the plant to
78-megawatts and the waste acceptance capacity by about 900-tons/day to
2,800-tons/day. The expansion is slated to be on line by the end of 1993.
   Semass is still working on building permits and obtaining a review of
the plans by the Department of Environmental Protection. It is expected
that some work on the expansion can begin this fall, he said.
   The sources of revenue to repay principal and interest on the bonds are
waste disposal fees to be derived from waste disposal contracts with
municipalities and private sources, as well as income from the solid-waste
spot market, said the official.
   Other sources of revenue will be derived from the sale of electricity to
Commonwealth Electric Company, the sale of ferrous and non-ferrous
recyclables and interest earned on funds and accounts as defined by the
indenture.
   The principal security for the bonds includes a mortgage on the Semass
plant as well as a leasehold mortgage on a transfer station in Braintree,
Massachusetts. Prudential Securities was the lead underwriter and
placement agent for the issue, which consisted of $255.6-million of
tax-exempt, 24-year bonds, $61.6-million of taxable bonds and $25-million
in taxable subordinated notes.
   Greenwich Partners, Inc. of Greenwich, Connecticut, was underwriter and
placement agent for the tax-exempt bonds, and Stephens Inc. of Little Rock,
Arkansas, was underwriter and placement agent for the taxable portion of
the issue.
   The major portion of the financing consisted of $145.6-million non-
alternate minimum tax (AMT) and $110-million AMT tax-exempt revenue bonds.
The non-AMT bonds were priced at par to yield 9%. The AMT bonds were
priced at par to yield 9.25%.
   The $61.6-million of taxable bonds are priced at par to yield 11.25%;
the subordinated notes were priced at par to yield 13.2%. The major
portion of the tax-exempt bonds were purchased by bond funds, according to
Greenwich Partners. The Semass bond issue will refund $178.6-million of
outstanding debt and provide approximately $160-million of the expansion of
the existing Semass plant.
   The principal security for the bonds includes a mortgage on the Semass
plant as well as a leasehold mortgage on a transfer station in Braintree,
Massachusetts. There is also a debt service reserve fund consisting of
approximately one year's maximum debt service.
   The existing Semass facility currently has operating contracts with 31
municipalities, one regional waste disposal district, Otis Air National
Guard Base and a commercial waste hauler.
   The Semass facility in Rochester, Massachusetts, went into commercial
operation in 1989. The shred and burn technology is based on the principle
of shredding municipal solid waste and magnetically removing a large
percentage of the ferrous metals.
   Shredding solid waste to a uniform six-inch size enhances the fuel value
so that a ton of processed refuse fuel has the equivalent heating value of
72-gallons of fuel oil. The fuel is fed to boilers where it burns
primarily in suspension creating heat and producing steam to generate
electricity, he said. The process includes clean-up systems for
removing pollutants from boiler exhaust gases. A bottom ash processing
system recovers ferrous and non-ferrous metals and converts the residual
into a usable aggregate product.
   The fly ash is stabilized to form a non-toxic, non-hazardous mortar
which is then landfilled and does not pose a threat to the environment,
continued the official. Potential uses for the Semass boiler aggregate
include cinder blocks for construction and as a gravel substitute for road
bases.
   The patented flyash stabilization system ensures that no hazardous or
toxic material from the facility leaves the site, they said. Other
facilities using the process have operated in Albany, New York, since 1981,
and Hamilton, Ontario, since 1972.
   During the 12-month period ending July, 1991, the existing plant
operated at the industry standard of approximately 85% of capacity and is
expected to continue at this rate. In the first year after completion, the
expansion facility is expected to operate at 80% of capacity and to reach
the 85% level thereafter, said the Semass official.
   The Semass facility has, since it first began accepting waste in 1988,
processed 1,250,000-tons of solid waste, and produced over 700,000-megawatt
hours of electricity, enough to service over 50,000 houses in southeastern
Massachusetts.
   It has recovered over 117-million pounds of metal, enough to build at
least 58,000 new cars, said the official. About 5% of the waste is
recovered as recyclable metals which are marketed. These metals contribute
a ''small percentage'' to the overall profits of the plant, he elaborated.
''But we look at it as a source of revenue plus the avoided cost of
landfilling,'' he explained. It also contributes to the recycling goals of
the regions, according to the official.
   The facility has produced approximately 97,000-tons of boiler aggregate
from bottom ash; and enough gravel substitute to produce over 6-million
concrete blocks. Semass is currently reviewing tests with the Department
of Environmental Protection. ''We're very confident the aggregate will be
found suitable for use in construction of the expansion, and that we'll be
able to market it in the future,'' the project official added.
   Semass is a private, for-profit entity owned by subsidiaries of Energy
Answers Corporation of Albany, New York, Bechtel Group Inc., Stephens
Holding Company and ESI Energy, Inc., an affiliate of Florida Power and
Light Company.

MECKLENBURG COUNTY, N.C., TO ISSUE RFP FOR 600 T/D MASS-BURN PLANT

   Officials in Mecklenburg County, N.C. plan to issue a request for
proposals on October 1 for a 600-ton/day, mass-burn incinerator to be built
at an industrial park south of Charlotte.
   The county is seeking a turnkey contractor that will design, construct
and operate the waste-to-energy plant, said Charles G. Horne, project
manager at the county's engineering department.
   The $80-million facility, which will be built at the Arrowood Industrial
Park, will generate steam for a General Tire factory and as much as 12.5 mw
of electricity for Duke Power, the local utility (Integrated Waste
Management, 20 March, 3).
   Horne told Integrated Waste Management that responses will be due Jan.
30, and that the county will select the winning proposal by the end of
March. Construction of the plant is likely to begin in the second half of
1993, with completion of the incinerator to follow in late 1995 or early
1996.
   Mecklenburg County's first waste-to-energy plant--a two-year-old,
235-t/d facility at the campus of the University of North
Carolina-Charlotte--was designed and built by MK Ferguson of Cleveland,
which also operates the incinerator for the county.
   Horne said that parties interested in receiving information about the
upcoming RFP should call 704-336-6178.

EPA SEEKS COMMENTS ON USED OIL OPTIONS; STRESSES SUPPORT FOR RECYCLING

   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last week sought public comment
on a wide range of options for the listing and management of used oil. In
issuing what an Agency official termed a ''neutral'' proposal--which
included one option that would list used oil as a hazardous waste--EPA
officials reiterated their interest in promoting used oil recycling in an
environmentally safe manner.
   In providing a 45-day public comment period, Agency officials said this
would be followed by issuance of final EPA rules in May, 1992. At the same
time, EPA officials noted that used oil recycling is also being taken up by
Congress as part of its reauthorization of the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act. Agency officials said they expected last week's proposal
''would become part of a dialogue with Congress''--the consequences of
which are still difficult to predict.
   Last week's proposal expands upon a 1985 Agency initiative that proposed
to list used oil as a hazardous waste. The Agency noted again last week
that it had backed away from that proposal as a result of public comments
which ''convinced the (A)gency that listing used oil as a hazardous waste
would severely cripple the recycling industry.''
   A successful lawsuit challenging this inaction, brought by the Natural
Resources Defense Council and others, concluded with the court ruling that
EPA was required to make a listing determination for used oil based on the
statutory criteria for listing, which relates to whether a material is
toxic or not.
   In addition to its option to list all used oil as hazardous, a second
option would list as hazardous ''only those categories of used oil that are
typically and frequently hazardous based on their toxicity at the point of
generation, rather than after collection and likely contamination.'' The
Agency said oils that may be listed under this option are those from
gasoline-powered engines, including used oils from automotive crankcases,
marine engines, and piston-engine airplanes.
   A third option would be not to list any used oils as hazardous, and
instead rely on management standards ''to address the types of
mismanagement that have historically occurred with used oil, such as
contamination with hazardous waste due to mixing, road oiling, releases,
and spills associated with storage and transportation.'' Should this
option be adopted, the Agency said used oil handlers would still be
required to test oil destined for disposal for hazardous characteristics,
and then manage it accordingly.
   The Agency stated its belief that used oils pose hazards to human health
and the environment, ''and therefore need to be managed safely.'' The
latest proposal contemplates a ''phased-in'' two-stage approach to
management standards, which would include the following options:
   --''Provide management standards for all used oils to some extent.''
   --''Provide one set of management requirements for all used oil
handlers.''
   --''Provide basic management standards immediately that balance the
interests of protective regulation and the need to promote recycling.''
   The Agency proposed that the Phase-1 requirements ''would be fairly
simple 'good housekeeping' practices that address the improper storage and
disposal of used oil by generators, transporters, recyclers, and disposal
facilities.'' It added that ''good housekeeping'' would include such
practices as ''inspecting for leaks, releases, or spills; maintaining
storage tanks and containers; and tracking recycled used oil from
generators to recyclers.''
   This Phase I would also ban road oiling and establish guidelines that
presume that ''all used oil being disposed is destined for recycling.''
Phase II under this approach would involve possible additional management
standards and controls for used oil, if needed.
   The EPA proposal also considers possible incentives for promoting the
collection and recycling of used oil generated by people who change thier
own oil, the so-called ''do-it-yourselfers.''

DENVER SELECTS CAMP DRESSER & MCKEE TO STUDY LOWRY LANDFILL SITE

   The city and county of Denver as well as the Denver Metro Wastewater
Reclamation District have selected Camp Dresser & McKee to perform a
remedial investigation/feasibility study and treatability study of the
Lowry Landfill, located in Arapahoe County, Colo., said a company
spokeswoman. The contract is valued at $1.6 million and completion of work
is slated for March, 1993, she said.
   The landfill accepted industrial and municipal wastes from 1967 to 1980,
is listed on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities
List and will be cleaned up through Superfund, she said. Under the
contract, Cambridge, Mass.-based Camp Dresser & McKee will evaluate the
nature and extent of contamination and evaluate remedial alternatives for
the soils and surface water and sediments media, she explained.

WHEELABRATOR, REF-FUEL AND ENERGY ANSWERS REVISE GREEN ISLAND PLANS

   Wheelabrator Technologies, American Ref-Fuel and Energy Answers Corp.
have all submitted revised proposals to build a 1,500-ton/day
waste-to-enegy plant in the Village of Green Island, New York, according to
John Brown, spokesman for the Green Island Solid Waste Advisory Committee.
   The town last month had sent letters to the firms allowing them to
submit additions or amendments to their initial plans for the venture
(Integrated Waste Management, 21 Aug., 1).
   Jack Risteau, project manager for Wheelabrator Corp., said the company
has added a shopping center to its proposal. ''We've added working with
Heritage Development Company of Syracuse to build a retail center which
could generate as much as $12 million a year for the village,'' he said.
''We've interested them (Heritage Development Company) enough that they've
entered into a working agreement with us, but we're in the early stage.''
   Risteau said both Wheelabrator Corp. and Heritage Development Company
are doing market studies and other analyses to determine the value of a
shopping center for the village. ''They (Green Island) don't have any
malls. It would be a real benefit for them. It would be about 300,000
square feet, and employ 750 people,'' he said. He said the mall would be
located north of Green Island's electric substation.
   Energy Answers Corp. has added new air pollution control equipment, and
upgraded the waste processing facility by adding a 500-ton/day construction
and demolition debris recycling facility and a paper recycling mill to its
proposal, according to Thomas Julien, Project Manager for Answers. Julien
said the company's unsure as to how much the entire package will cost
because the sizes of the facilities have not been determined. However, it
is expected that Energy Answers Corp. will generate between $3- and $4
million annually in payments to the village.
   Finally, American Ref-Fuel has proposed in its revision three different
projects to complement the waste-to-energy and recycling facilities
featured in its original plan. According to J. Kevin Cmunt, Project
Development Manager for American Ref-Fuel, one option is building a Kraft
Market Pulp Mill, which would produce uncoated freesheet, coated
groundwood, coated freesheet, uncoated groundwood and bristol at a rate of
600 t/d. This includes stationery, tablets, and copier paper.
   American Ref-Fuel also proposed a 100% recycled newsprint mill or a
linerboard facility. According to Cmunt, six leading paper manufacturing
companies have expressed interest in the projects. He added an addition of
a paper recycling project would result in benefits of $8,475,000 to
$10,850,000 to the Village of Green Island per year.

KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL (KAB) LAUNCHES SOLID WASTE WORKSHOP SERIES in

KEEP AMERICA BEAUTIFUL (KAB) LAUNCHES SOLID WASTE WORKSHOP SERIES in
Phoenix, Arizona on September 27. The newly-designed community workshops
are intended to educate citizens and public officials about solid waste
handling practices, according to an official of the Stamford,
Connecticut-based non-profit group.
   Future solid waste workshops will be scheduled around the country. ''The
new series will continue KAB's efforts to counter our growing dependence on
a declining number of landfills, the increasing amount of trash produced
each year, and the inability of communities to site new disposal
facilities,'' said the official.
   ''Our goal,'' he concluded, ''is to accelerate the training of concerned
local citizens and public officials to prepare them to assume greater roles
in planning and implementing solid waste management programs at the
community level.'' KAB is a national public education organization
dedicated to improving waste handling practices in 460 certified affiliated
communities in 40 states, including 19 official, state-affiliated
organizations.

SWANA RFQ DRAWS 49 PROSPECTIVE CONTRACTORS FOR EPA'S MITE PROGRAM

   The Solid Waste Association of North America (SWANA) has received 49
responses to its request for qualifications (RFQ) from companies,
universities and laboratories seeking to be subcontractors to perform
evaluations under the Environmental Protection Agency's Municipal Solid
Waste Innovative Technology Evaluation (MITE) program.
   SWANA and the EPA recently entered into a three-year cooperative
agreement in which the association is assisting the agency in implementing
the evaluation program (Integrated Waste Management, 29 May, 2). EPA
established the program a year ago to ''help developers address barriers to
commercialization by providing objective, independent, third-party
evaluations of selected technologies,'' said a SWANA official.
   Information produced by the program will be used not only by technology
developers but by local governments that are responsible for day-to-day
management of municipal solid wastes, the official said.
   EPA's evaluation program in the first year included solidification and
stabilization of municipal waste combustion ash residues. Second year
activities are being directed at evaluating other strategies for managing
municipal solid wastes, such as recycling, landfilling, combustion and
materials processing.
   A SWANA spokesperson said the association had not yet established the
schedule for deciding on the RFQs and further evaluations.

MID-AMERICA WASTE SEEN MAINTAINING 25%-30% ANNUAL EARNINGS GROWTH

   Mid-American Waste Systems Inc., which is one of the fastest growing and
most profitable solid waste companies n the U.S., should maintain annual
earnings growth of 25% to 30%, according to a report prepared by Stephen
Schweich, research analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, Baltimore, Maryland.
   Mid-American revenues are growing at a better than 30% annual rate and
operating margins exceed 25%, he continued. Solid waste management is a
$28-billion per year industry in the U.S., and ''we believe Mid-American
can reach $300-million to $400-million in revenues by 1995 while
maintaining its current profit margins,'' said the report.
   The firm, based in Canal Winchester, Ohio, has extensive landfill
resources, well-managed transfer stations and collection operations,
growing special waste businesses, and experienced management, according to
Schweich. It has 17 operating landfills, 9 transfer stations and 8
collection companies.
   Its principal areas of geographic focus include Ohio, Indiana,
Pennsylvania, Illinois and West Virginia. New landfill sites are under
development in Florida, South Carolina, California and Colorado. In the
1986 to 1989 period, Mid-American's revenues grew from $4-million to
$48-million, and net income increased tenfold.
   The company's rapid geographic expansion came primarily from
acquisitions of 10 landfills and numerous waste collection companies in
Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Mid-American's basic acquisition
philosophy has been to buy companies cheaply, bring in professional
management, exploit synergies with other Mid-American operations, and
ultimately build critical mass and profitability, explained the analysis.
   During the past two years, Mid-American has added other territories to
its operations base including West Virginia, Georgia and Colorado.
Moreover, the company is pursing ''greenfield'' landfill projects in
California and Florida, elaborated the report.
   According to Alex. Brown estimates, the total North American solid waste
industry was about $28-billion in 1990. Municipalities and independent
operators control roughly 71% of the market. Waste Management handles 14.3%
of the waste, Browning-Ferris controls 8.9%, and Laidlaw 2.7%.
   Of the 3.4% of the waste handled by emerging players--representing
$950-million in 1990--Attwoods earned $338-million. Chambers Development
garnered $214-million, and Western Waste $190-milion. Mid-American
achieved revenues of $79-million, American Waste $61-million, Sanifill
$39-million. Republic Waste had revenues of $18-million, and Integrated
Waste, $12-million.
