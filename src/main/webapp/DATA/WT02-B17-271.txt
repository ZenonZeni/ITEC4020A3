<P>Tips on using your air conditioning system:  
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Keep your cooling system well-tuned with periodic maintenance by a professional serviceman.  Ask the serviceman how the energy efficiency of the system can be increased.
<LI>If you need central air conditioning, select a unit with the lowest suitable capacity and highest efficiency.  
<LI>A larger unit than you need not only costs more to buy and run, but probably won't remove enough moisture from the air.  
<LI>Plant trees and shrubs to shade air-conditioning units.  You can increase efficiency by up to 10 percent.  
<LI>Install an attic ventilation fan to cool the house when it's cool outside, even if you have central air conditioning.
