<H2>Campaign To End Discrimination Training Meeting Targets Parity</H2>
<hr>


	NAMI's Campaign to End Discrimination Against People with Brain Disorders has taken off.  In late March, 75 state campaign and media market coordinators met at the first state campaign coordinators training meeting in St. Louis, Missouri.  Each state-appointed coordinator is the contact for campaign activities and will work with the state AMI affiliate and local affiliates to get as many people as possible involved in the campaign.
<P>
	This year's goal is to introduce parity legislation in as many states as possible.  And while doing this, we will also educate legislators, insurers, and other persons and groups who need the facts about brain disorders and the justice of parity in health insurance.  Materials such as brochures, buttons, posters, mini-cards, and postcards are available to local affiliates that have planned parity activities.  (Your state coordinator will track activities.)
<P>
	To become involved in your state's activities and receive materials, contact your state office for the name of your state coordinator.  To learn more about the campaign, see the center insert in the last Advocate (March/April).
