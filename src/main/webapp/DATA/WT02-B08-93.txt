<H1>CHILDHOOD INFLUENCES<BR>
<HR></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
PRE-BIRTH and childhood experiences were increasingly being seen as strong
influences on how adults handled their lives, a leading American psychiatrist,
Dr Paul Plotsky, said in Melbourne today.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This view is still regarded by some psychiatrists as old-fashioned
and even politically incorrect because it seems to put less importance on
self-esteem and an individual's ability to control his or her behaviour,&quot;
he said. &quot;But there are signs that it is coming back into favour with
great force as a subject for research.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The view was related to the nature/nurture, or heredity/environment, debate,
and was leading to a closer study of the interaction between genetics and
life experience.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Plotsky is professor of psychiatry and director of the stress/neurobiology
laboratory at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia. He is attending the CINP
(Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum) World Congress in
Melbourne. <BR>
<BR>
Research throughout the world had shown that a disturbed childhood could
seriously damage a person's ability to deal with the trauma of being involved
in the Vietnam War, the Port Arthur massacre or the Holocaust, or even an
unstable marriage or a traffic accident. <BR>
<BR>
Dr Plotsky said ethical considerations still placed a strong barrier against
establishing how far people's behaviour might be pre-determined by their
genetic inheritance. <BR>
