Hello!  I'm a graduate student in Geophysics at the 
<a href="http://zorba.uafadm.alaska.edu">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>.  
In fact I'm located at the Geophysical Institute and am affiliated
with the Alaska SAR Facility (ASF) 
<a href="http://www.images.alaska.edu">STEP</a> 
program.  I'm <i>also</i>
<! note the use of `i' gives italics; `b' would give bold.>
<! If I want to make the link string in italics I just nest the conventions... >
affiliated with the Arctic Research Supercomputer Center 
(<a href="http://www.arsc.edu">ARSC</a>) 
as they are nice enough to let me use their CRAY.  
I hope to graduate in late 1997; whither then I can not say.  
<P>
My research focus is on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as a tool for 
studying glaciers, specifically deriving glacier surface topography and 
velocity using spaceborne radar interferometry (SRI).  
This particular methodology was invented at JPL, with a great deal of
the credit due to Dick Goldstein.  
<P>
The image below is an example of an interferogram produced from two 
SAR images taken three days apart in 1994.  The colors on some of the 
rocks (dark areas, wide parallel color bands) indicate topography.  
The colors on the ice indicate mostly surface motion; if you count in 
from the edge of the glacier towards the center, each color cycle (e.g. 
from one band of red to the next) is an increase in speed of about 10 
meters per year.  Thus the center of the glacier is moving faster than 
the edges, and fastest of all through the narrow bottleneck.  Further 
off to the east (right) there is an ice divide where the direction 
of flow of the ice reverses from right-to-left to left-to-right.  
<P>
Warning:  Don't stare at this interferogram for too long!  You'll start 
seeing fringes when you close your eyes at night!
