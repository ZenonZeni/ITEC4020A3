<H1>Shipboard HRPT for JAMSTEC</H1>

<P>
The Japan Marine Science Technology Engineering Center's (JAMSTEC) R/V Kaiyo carries a TeraScan <A HREF="/glossary.html#HRPT">HRPT</A> receiving system which is installed in a portable shipping container.  This system is designed to acquire, process, display, and archive data transmitted from <A HREF="/glossary.html#HRPT">HRPT</A> telemetry, in real time, from the U.S. <A HREF="/glossary.html#NOAA">NOAA</A> polar orbiting satellites.
</P>

<P>
Burt Baker, of SeaSpace's Customer Support Staff, traveled with the Kaiyo on leg two of the cruise from Koror, Palau to Yokosuka, Japan, as a TeraScan operator/analyst.  Mr. Baker's 
primary responsibility was to ensure correct operation of the system and to produce <A HREF="/glossary.html#SST">SST</A> imagery on a daily basis.
</P>

<P>
In addition to providing <A HREF="/glossary.html#SST">SST</A> daily imagery, the TeraScan system also supplied images of a large stationary tropical depression about 500 km to the west of the Kaiyo.  The 
vessel has a <A HREF="/glossary.html#GMS">GMS</A>/<A HREF="/glossary.html">WEFAX</A> receiving system installed on the bridge, but the TeraScan system provided higher resolution images.
</P>

<P>
The Cruise director and Chief Scientist for this leg of R/V Kaiyo's cruise was Mr. Ichio Asanuma.

The following is a glimpse of Burt Baker's travel journal.

<P>
The Kaiyo departed from Palau on May 11, 1994 and promptly found heavy seas and a stationary tropical depression (which soon became typhoon #4).  For several days I provided images of #4 for the bridge.
</P>

<P>
On May 15th we entered the East China Sea area, where most of the detailed oceanographic survey work took place.  Genrally,
The ship would stop and maintain position using bow/stern thrusters while Lidar equipment was deployed to measure phytoplankton concentrations at various depth.s  Water
samples, both surface and at depth, were also collected.
