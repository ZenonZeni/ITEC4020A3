<h1>Letter from the American Medical Association</h1>

<p><b>Re: H.R. 6906</b> </p>

<hr>

<p>SENATOR BROWN: Before we adjourn, I desire to place in the
record a letter regarding the pending bill addressed to Senator
Harrison by Dr. William C. Woodward, of the American Medical
Association, Chicago, Ill. </p>

<p>American Medical Association </p>

<p>Bureau of Legal Medicine and Legislation </p>

<p>Chicago, July 10, 1937 </p>

<p>Hon. Pat Harrison </p>

<p>Chairman, Committee on Finance, United States Senate </p>

<p>Washington D.C. </p>

<p>SIR: I have been instructed by the board of trustees of the
American Medical Association to protest on behalf of the
association against the enactment in it present form of so much
of H.R. 6906 as relates to the medicinal use of cannabis and its
preparations and derivatives. The act is entitled &quot;An Act to
impose an occupational excise tax upon certain dealers in
marihuana, to impose a transfer tax upon certain dealings in
marihuana, and to safeguard the revenue therefrom by registry and
recording.&quot; </p>

<p>Cannabis and its preparations and derivatives are covered in
the bill by the term &quot;marihuana&quot; as that term is
defined in section 1, paragraph (b). There is no evidence,
however, that the medicinal use of these drugs has caused or is
causing cannabis addiction. As remedial agents, they are used to
an inconsiderable extent, and the obvious purpose and effect of
this bill is to impose so many restrictions on their use as to
prevent such use altogether. Since the medicinal use of cannabis
has not caused and is not causing addiction, the prevention of
the use of the drug for medicinal purposes can accomplish no good
end whatsoever. How far it may serve to deprive the public of the
benefits of a drug that on further research may prove to be of
substantial value, it is impossible to foresee. </p>

<p>The American Medical Association has no objection to any
reasonable regulation of the medicinal use of cannabis and its
preparations and derivatives. It does pretest, however, against
being called upon to pay a special tax, to use special order
forms in order to procure the drug, to keep special records
concerning its professional use and to make special returns to
the Treasury Department officials, as a condition precedent to
the use of cannabis in the practice of medicine. in the several
States, all separate and apart from the taxes, order forms,
records, and reports required under the Harrison Narcotics Act
with reference to opium and coca leaves and their preparations
and derivatives. </p>

<p>If the medicinal use of cannabis calls for Federal legal
regulation further than the legal regulation that now exists, the
drug can without difficulty be covered under the provisions of
the Harrison Narcotics Act by a suitable amendment. By such a
procedure the professional use of cannabis may readily be
controlled as effectively as are the professional uses of opium
and coca leaves, with less interference with professional
practice and less cost and labor on the part of the Treasury
Department. </p>

<p>It has been suggested that the inclusion of cannabis into the
Harrison Narcotics Act would jeopardize the constitutionality of
that act, but that suggestion has been supported by no specific
statements of its legal basis or citations of legal authorities. </p>

<p>Wm. C. Woodward, </p>

<p>Legislative Counsel </p>

<p>Whereupon at 11:37 AM Monday, July 12, 1937, the subcommittee
adjourned. </p>
