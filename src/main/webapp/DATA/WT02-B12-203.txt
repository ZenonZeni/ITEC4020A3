at Strawberry Farms in 1996</FONT></TT></A></H2>


<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">During the summer of 1996, UFW

efforts to organize strawberry pickers around Watsonville featured

prominently in news stories.  According to the AFL-CIO, the UFW

strawberry organizing effort is currently the largest union organizing

effort in the US, involving $2 million and 40 full-time organizers

to organize 15,000 farm workers employed on 270 strawberry farms.

 </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">However, the campaign did not

lead to any UFW election victories.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On August 6, 1996, the AFL-CIO's

Executive Council pledged matching funds to the UFW's strawberry

organizing campaign in California, and to the Teamsters apple

organizing campaign in Washington.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">American unions need to recruit

an estimated 700 new members each day, or 250,000 per year, to

keep the percentage of US workers in unions at its current 15

percent level.  In 1995, US unions added about 100,000 new members.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Currently, none of the strawberry

farms in California, which produced $552 million worth of strawberries

in 1995, 80 percent of US strawberries, have union contracts.

 California produced 68 million 12-pint trays of strawberries

in 1994, 60 million trays in 1995, and a projected 69 million

trays in 1996.  Each 12-pint tray is worth $4 to $10 at the farm

level.  California strawberry yields average about 57,000 pounds

per acre. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The UFW is targeting large farms,

those with 100 or more acres, and packer-marketers such as Driscoll

Strawberry Associates, WellPict, Gargiulo Farms (owned by Monsanto),

and Naturipe that often make arrangements with ex-pickers to grow

three or six acres of strawberries on a sharecropping basis.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The UFW filed over 35 notices

to take access to workers on strawberries, and filed 25 notices

of intent to organize, meaning that the union obtained authorization

cards from at least 10 percent of the workers, but there were

no union petitions for elections, which require that the union

present authorization cards from 50 percent of the workers employed

when employment is at least 50 percent of peak employment.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">During an August visit by Arturo

Rodriquez, UFW President, to a crew of some of 1,200 Gargiulo

Farms' workers, only one worker asked Rodriguez questions and

several told a reporter that they do not want or need a union.

 Despite the UFW's &quot;flexibility,&quot; most of the larger

strawberry growers hired labor consultants to oppose the union.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">According to the UFW, strawberry

pickers' wages have not been raised for 10 years, and most do

not have health insurance.  In one UFW fund-raising letter, the

UFW reportedly called strawberries La Fruta del Diablo (the fruit

of the devil) because so many growers allegedly break laws governing

wages and working conditions.  The most-recently arrived strawberry

pickers are Mixtec Indians from Oaxaca, many of whom are illegal

aliens.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On September 1, the Sacramento

Bee ran a long story on the strawberry campaign, emphasizing that,

since Chavez died April 23, 1993, 47-year old Rodriguez has given

the UFW a youthful face but boosted the UFW's membership only

from 21,000 to 26,000.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Housing and Urban Development

Secretary Henry Cisneros and AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney

addressed the 2,000 farm workers attending the biennial UFW convention

September 1 in Fresno.  Cisneros urged legal immigrants to become

citizens, asserting that 70 percent of the legal immigrants who

would lose benefits under the new welfare law were eligible to

become US citizens.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Sweeney praised the UFW for its

organizing efforts, and announced that strawberries would be boycotted

in 50 US cities. </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The New York Times (July 3) and

CNN (July 7) ran stories on the UFW's efforts to organize strawberry

pickers.  According to CNN, strawberry pickers have average hourly

earnings of $6, although the grower interviewed employed pickers

who averaged $9 to $10 per hour and offered the workers additional

fringe benefits.  Some strawberry pickers reportedly fear that

union elections might persuade some growers not to grow strawberries.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On August 9, 1996, thousands of

farm workers reportedly marched through Watsonville to oppose

the UFW's organizing attempts.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">The strawberry industry was hit

by a health scare in June.  On June 8, 1996, Texas health officials

announced that they thought that California strawberries were

responsible for an outbreak of cyclospora, an intestinal disease,

and both strawberry shipments and prices fell, costing California

growers an estimated $15 to $20 million in lost revenue.  The

outbreak was eventually traced to raspberries imported from Guatemala.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Profiles of UFW leaders emphasize

that most work for little pay--UFW President Rodriguez received

$6,362 in 1995, plus housing and reimbursement for expenses.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Egg City, owned by Okura and Co.

of Tokyo, and once the largest egg-producing facility in the world,

with three million chickens, and 39 chicken houses each with 80,000

to 90,000 laying hens, is closing.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Egg City, located in Fillmore,

about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles, was the scene of one

of the UFW's bitterest defeats in the 1980s.  The UFW was certified

as bargaining agent for Egg City workers on July 7, 1978 and,

after Egg City was sold to the Kroger grocery store chain in 1979,

the UFW-Kroger agreement in 1979 became the UFW's first poultry

contract.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Kroger sold Egg City to the Careau

Group in May 1985.  The UFW contract with Egg City expired on

September 1, 1985.  Instead of discussing higher wages with the

UFW, Egg City's new owners argued that they were losing money

because they were paying about $2.50 hourly above the prevailing

wage in the industry.  </FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">There were nine months of negotiations

between September 1985 and May 1986, but there was no agreement

when, in May 1986, Egg City filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.

 Egg City asked the bankruptcy court to cut wages for 240 UFW-represented

workers by $2 per hour, and the court approved the wage cut in

June 1986.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On June 22, 1986, the UFW called

a strike at Egg City, and Egg City permanently replaced most of

the strikers.  The UFW mounted a consumer boycott against the

buyers of Egg City eggs, and in August 1986, McDonald's and grocery

store chains Ralph's and Von's stopped buying Egg City eggs. 

</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Egg City sought an injunction

to stop UFW boycott activities, and asked to have the NLRB reclassify

about half of its workers as nonfarm workers.  An ALRB-supervised

decertification election was held at Egg City on November 3, 1986,

and in April 1988 the ALRB decertified the UFW as bargaining agent

for Egg City workers.  During the summer of 1993, the UFW and

Egg City privately settled a suit in which Egg City charged that

the UFW's boycott activities had cost it $6.6 million.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">On September 4, 1996, a crop duster

sprayed cotton and 22 grape pickers in an adjacent field were

hospitalized for pesticide poisoning.  Some 280 grape pickers

were employed on the grape ranch owned by Sun Pacific, a 3,000-acre

grape operation near Shafter, California.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier">Miguel Contreras, a former UFW

organizer, was elected secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles

County Federation of Labor in May 1996.  Contreras worked for

the UFW from the mid-1960s through 1977, and then organized hotel

and restaurant employees.  Half of the 650,000 positions in manufacturing

in Los Angeles county are filled by Hispanics.</FONT></TT>
