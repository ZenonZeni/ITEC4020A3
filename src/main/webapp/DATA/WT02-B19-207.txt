Each year, thousands of children are identified as having a learning disability, and many more fail in school because of difficulties in learning to read.  A new analysis of decades of research about how young children can best learn to read indicates that, in most cases, these difficulties can be prevented, according to the National Center  to Improve the Tools of Educators (NCITE), based at the University of Oregon. 
The results of the synthesis funded by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) have been released through the <I><B>Learning to Read, Reading to Learn</b></i> public awareness campaign.<P>

The ERIC Clearinghouse on Disabilities and Gifted Education (ERIC EC), its host organization, The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), and the ERIC Clearinghouse on Reading, English, and Communication (ERIC CS) at Indiana University are among the 25 partner organizations that will provide information about this reading research.<P>

A network of researchers who can act as resources has been established.  These researchers can provide technical assistance for schools trying to create an effective reading program for children with learning disabilities.  A list of these researchers is also provided. <P>

Some of the materials included in the information kit are listed below:<P>
