Press Release Issued by Houston's Drug-Free Business Initiative Houston
(July 9, 1996)<BR>
<H2><CENTER>COMING TO A STREET CORNER NEAR YOU?      </CENTER>
</H2>
<P><CENTER>Houston's Drug-Free Business Director Fears Results of Lenient
Drug Policy</CENTER>
<P> <BR>
Federally-funded heroin distribution clinics on the corner.  Methadone<BR>
maintenance programs gone awry.  Needles and condoms openly distributed
to<BR>
minors.  Frustrated police officials with little control.  With results
such<BR>
as these raging through the streets of Switzerland, the dangers of a lenient<BR>
drug-control policy were made abundantly evident last week to Calvina Fay,<BR>
Executive Director of Houston's Drug-Free Business Initiative.<BR>
 <BR>
 &quot;As I stood and watched young addicts inject themselves with heroin
as<BR>
though this was normal behavior, I realized that no attempt is made to<BR>
intervene on behalf of the addict and get him or her into treatment,&quot;
Fay<BR>
observed.  &quot;The objective of the Swiss law seems to be to assist the
addicts,<BR>
not get them off the drug.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
 Switzerland's current drug-control policy, while outlawing consumption,
is<BR>
also a futile attempt to reduce the harms associated with use by taking<BR>
certain drugs off the street and putting them in the control of government
distribution clinics.<BR>
One frequently heard argument against the adoption of a similar law in the<BR>
United States centers around the concern that such a policy would serve
only<BR>
to magnify drug usage, rather than eliminate it.  And according to Fay,
her<BR>
observations of the situation in Switzerland only support such an argument.<BR>
 <BR>
 &quot;The alarming thing about the state of affairs in Switzerland is that
this<BR>
did not occur overnight,&quot; Fay said.  &quot;This situation emerged over
a 10-year<BR>
period and was slowly created through a process that I see evolving here
in<BR>
the United States.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
 Switzerland's lenient environment, according to Fay, began with inadequate<BR>
controls to enforce the law.  Consumption and trafficking of drugs such
as<BR>
marijuana, cocaine and heroin are illegal.  However, all that enforcement
can<BR>
do to prevent such crimes is give the offender a ticket; imprisonment comes<BR>
only after a multitude have been issued.  Hence, officials are powerless
to<BR>
effectively control what Fay sees as a growing problem.<BR>
 <BR>
 The situation was furthered with the development of the government-subsidized
<BR>
programs designed to monitor current drug addicts and limit access to certain
drugs.  <BR>
Such efforts, in addition to free heroin distribution clinics and methadone
distribution <BR>
centers, include needle  exchange programs in the name of AIDS prevention
and public <BR>
shooting galleries, where street addicts are provided with a room, food,
condoms, and<BR>
clean needles.<BR>
 <BR>
 &quot;What they are doing to these addicts is absolutely criminal.  The<BR>
government has given up on them and thrown them away,&quot; Fay said.  &quot;I
fear<BR>
that we will see the same situation in our country in just a few years.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
 As expert in workplace drug prevention, Fay returned from Switzerland last<BR>
week, where she addressed employers about the impact of drug abuse in the<BR>
workplace.<BR>
 <BR>
Fay's presentation, requested by Swiss employers concerned about safety
and<BR>
productivity implications of the lenient drug policy, detailed the findings<BR>
of a recent research study she directed through HDFBI in collaboration with<BR>
the University of Houston - Clear Lake.  The study, which gathered employers'<BR>
attitudes about drug control strategies, such as mandatory drug testing
and<BR>
employee assistance programs in the workplace, attempted to measure the<BR>
impact of such methods on workplace productivity.<BR>
 <BR>
 HDFBI is a non-profit organization dedicated to eliminating alcohol and
drug<BR>
abuse in the workplace by providing information and assistance to the<BR>
business community.  Founded in 1985 after the Strategic Planning Committee<BR>
of the Houston Chamber of Commerce asked for business sector involvement
in<BR>
the community's anti-drug activities, the organization is supported by the<BR>
FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Houston Crackdown, Texans' War on
Drugs<BR>
and the U.S. Attorney's office. <BR>
