<TITLE>EATING DISORDERS</TITLE>

<H1><STRONG><center>Eating Disorders and Body Image Disturbance</center></STRONG></H1>
<HR>

The most common eating disorders on college campuses are Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia.  Persons with Anorexia Nervosa deliberately attempt to lose weight through self-starvation.  Even though they may be extremely underweight, they see themselves as "fat," deny any problem with their eating habits, and will resist any efforts made to get them to eat or return to a more healthy weight.<P>
  
Persons with Bulimia engage in frequent, often daily binge eating in which they eat very large amounts of food, often in secret.  They will then try to counteract the binge by purging, which may involve self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives, or prolonged fasting and exercise.  Persons with Bulimia feel out of control in the cycle of bingeing and purging.  Both of these disorders occur more frequently in young women, with Bulimia being the more common.  It is estimated that one in twenty college-age women have an eating disorder.  Both disorders may have serious medical consequences.<P> 

While many persons with Anorexia Nervosa or Bulimia deny the problem and are reluctant to seek help, they often come to the attention of friends and family.  A direct, caring, and nonjudgmental expression of concern about their health by friends and family is often a vital first step in enabling persons with eating disorders to seek appropriate treatment.  Help is available in the form of individual psychotherapy, medical and nutritional counseling, and self-help support groups.  With proper help, persons with an eating disorder can learn to stabilize their eating patterns, maintain a healthy weight, and become less preoccupied with food.<P>
Many Americans believe that thinner is better. People with eating 
disorders believe it so deeply that their weight and dieting success 
become the measure of their self-esteem. Thinking that eating is the
 cause and result of many of their problems, they become trapped in a 
vicious cycle of repeated ritualistic and rigid behavior focused on
food.<P>

<HR><center><H3>Symptoms of Eating Disorders</H3></center>

<P>The most common eating disorders include <I>anorexia nervosa</I> 
(self-starvation), and <I>bulimia</I> (bingeing and purging). Some experts
also consider compulsive overeating an eating disorder.
<P><B>Anorexics</B> are often thin to the point of emaciation, but are afraid 
to gain weight. They may have symptoms caused by severe weight loss:
<I>dry skin and hair, cold hands and feet, general weakness, constipation
and digestive problems, insomnia, and amenorrhea</I> (loss of menstrual 
periods). As the weight loss progresses, more severe problems may develop 
such as increased susceptibility to infections, stress fractures, ketosis
(severe chemical imbalances), and weaknesses of the heart muscle that 
can lead to death.<P>

<B>Bulimics</B> may be of average or slightly above average
weight, usually do most of their bingeing and purging secretly, and have
rapid weight gains and losses. They purge through self-induced
vomiting, abusing laxatives and diuretics, fasting, or overexercising, and
are subject to medical problems caused by their purging methods as well
as their eating habits. Medical problems include <I>dehydration,
constipation and digestive disorders, severe dental problems, and muscle
weakness</I>.  As bulimia progresses, ulcers and life-threatening heart
irregularities may develop. 
<P><B>Many anorexics may periodically
binge and purge like bulimics.</B> 
They suffer from a combination of
anorexic and bulimic symptoms. 
<P><B>Compulsive overeaters</B> are
usually overweight and may become
obese. As their weight increases they
may begin to suffer from 
<I>shortness of breath, high blood pressure,</I>
 and <I>joint problems</I>. If
they become severely obese, their problems can progress to
<I>osteoarthritis</I> and life-threatening disorders such as <I>heart
and gall bladder diseases and diabetes</I>.

<P>What is food abuse?
Overeating---<B>binge eating</B>---<B>trash diets</B>
---<B>fad
dieting</B>---<B>fasting.</B> These are only a few samples of 
the ways people may use and abuse
 food. We are continually confronted in newspapers, magazines and 
TV,
with ads imploring and encouraging us to buy, prepare and eat all kinds
of food and beverages. The single easiest method to enjoy the "good life"
is to eat, eat, eat! To eat in abundance and whatever one chooses has
become a benchmark of success, an outward symbol that one has arrived. At
the same time we are encouraged and often pressured by others and
ourselves to be thin and maintain perfect figures. We seem to be
assaulted by food merchandisers at one moment and by fashion designers and
figure salons the next. It boils down to the conflict between enjoying
great quantities and varieties of food, while at the same time remaining
pencil thin. The paradox is hard to manage for many people, and often results in one of the eating problems identified above.

<P>The anxious striving to be thin is supported by an
irrational societal belief, which goes something like this: "being thin
equals happiness and success." The irrationality of this belief becomes
apparent, as we objectively look around us and notice that some thin
people are unhappy while some heavy people are quite happy and content.
Most importantly, people come in a variety of body types! This
understanding can help us to begin to re-evaluate our own relationship to food.


<HR><center><H3>Symptoms</H3></center>

<P>Let's take a moment to look more carefully
at the food problems mentioned earlier.
<UL>
<LI><B>Overeating:</B> A
tendency to consume more calories than is necessary to maintain
normal body weight. This problem is often triggered by stress and may
be physiologically based or a result of learned eating
habits.
<LI><B>Trash Diets: </B>By "<I>trash</I>" we mean the steady
consumption of questionably nutritious foods such as <I>chips, soda, candy, cake, or cookies</I> in quantities
that account for a high percentage of a person's daily caloric intake.
<LI><B>Fasting: </B>A person may fast for reasons other than diet,
but in this context we mean the avoidance of all caloric intake for periods of 
hours or days as means of weight control.
<LI><B>Fad Dieting: </B>The practice of consuming only one food
or food group (i.e. fruits) or beverage (water) as a means of weight
control. May include periods of fasting , with or without diet pills.
<LI><B>Binge Eating: </B>The tendency to consume large amounts of
food (in excess of 2000 calories) at one time. The occurrence may be
accidental or premeditated. If premeditated the binge may be followed by
purging, using laxatives and diuretics, or fasting to avoid weight gain. This is 
known as <B>bulimia</B>.</UL>

<P>Most everyone has tended to misuse food at
one time or another, in one of the ways just described, and most of us
have tried one or more techniques for weight control.
<B>Can you place yourself in any of these categories? Do you tend to combine one or more such as overeating followed by fasting, or bingeing on certain foods following a fad diet of cauliflower and prune juice?!</B>


<P>Take a moment to listen to these strategies and judge for yourself just 
how much food interferes with your daily routines. Just how disruptive to
your life is food and eating? Note which of the following statements
apply 
to you.
<OL>
<LI>I daydream a lot each day about food.
<LI>If I get nervous or anxious while I'm studying I go to the 
refrigerator to look for food.
<LI>I'm preoccupied with my weight and my appearance and don't
think I look good in my clothes.
<LI>I'm more uptight than I would like to be around others 
because of my weight/appearance.
<LI>I'd like to start an exercise program but I'm embarrassed about 
how I would look in a swim suit or jogging shorts.
<LI>I tend to deal with feeling lonely and depressed by eating.
</OL>

<P>This is only a sample of what people say or do to themselves in the 
process of relating to food. Do several of these statements apply to you? 
As stated earlier we all abuse food from time to time. However if several 
of the terms apply to you, and you find food and the preoccupat ion with 
food interfering with positive life choices and activities, then you may 
have an approach to eating which you want to alter.

<p> Here are some 
<B>general tips</B> which can help
you break the food, self-hate, guilt and more food cycle.
<OL>
<LI>
Refuse to buy into societal expectations about food consumption
and appearance. Learn to live moderately and value maintenance of good
health over external appearance. Question advertisements you see about
appearance and food.
<LI> Try to be creative about everyday life. Are
there new skills you would like to learn or new interests you can
develop? Learn to be more assertive, if you need to be. Sometimes binge eating is just an inappropriate way of "stuffing down" anger. Expand your creativity with a new hobby like pottery or photography.
<LI> Renew your interest in other people. Try to become less preoccupied 
with yourself, your performance and your appearance.
<LI> Engage in regular, vigorous exercise. Find a
partner to share an 
exercise program.
<LI> Find ways to lead a more calm relaxed life. Consider meditation, 
yoga, relaxation training and other stress reducing activities.
</OL>

<P>As you can see, some problems in
eating can be helped by changing your 
routine way of doing things.
Successful management of food may also involve 
altering the way you think
about food, yourself or societal expectation s 
about appearance. It also
involves developing a permanent pattern of good 
eating habits which work
for you.

<HR><P><H3>Strategies</H3>

<P>Here are some specific
strategies to consider. If overeating is your 
problem: buy limited
amounts of food. Don't overstock. Eat slowly. Take 
twice as much time to
eat as you have been. Give yourself permission to 
stop when you feel
full. Fix your plate before sitting down to eat. Do not 
put extra food on
the table. Eat in a different room of your apartment or 
house. Break up
routine habit patterns. Always leave something on
your plate uneaten.
Allow yourself a small, nutritious snack before bedtime 
if you want one.
Don't read or watch TV while eating.

<P>And if you are into "trash"
dieting, here are other strategies: 
<I>Educate yourself</I> about good
nutrition. <I>Eat</I> breakfast, lunch 
and dinner at <I>regular times.
Stabilize your eating habits </I>around 
healthy foods. <I>Avoid impulse
buying at the grocery store.</I> Make a 
shopping li st. Stick to it.
<I>Keep healthy snacks at home</I> such as 
different kinds of fruit and
juices. Allow yourself an occasional bag of 
chips or similar food as you
begin to eat more healthily.

<P>If <B>fasting</B> is your problem,
these hints might help: question your 
reasons for your need to be thin.
Are there people in your present or past 
who want you to be thin? Ask
yourself, "Why?" Cutting back a bit in a 
well-balanced nutritional
program will lead to more consistent weight 
control than fasting.
<B>Fasting is always followed by a desire to overeat 
or gorge</B>. A fast
which lasts more than a day, sometimes less, <B>may 
result in</B>
negative physical symptoms such as <B>headache, dizziness, 
fainting and
problems concentrating. </B> Moreover, <I>fasting, laxatives, 
diet
pills, and purging can also lower your metabolism.</I> Paradoxically,
then you burn fewer calories from the food you eat, thereby working
against the
 very thing you want to achieve.

<P>Many of the same
points that were made about fasting hold true for the 
person who tries
exotic diets as a habitual way of relating to food. 
However, a couple of
points might be made.
<OL>
<LI> Begin to look back over time and notice
the pattern of your dieting
schemes. Why haven't they worked? Are you
looking for magic?
<LI> Educate yourself about good nutrition.
<LI> Agree
with yourself to eat three, well-balanced moderate meals a day 
with a
reasonable exercise program for 3 to 6 months. See what
happens!
</OL>

<P>Those of you who are <B>food bingers</B> might
want to ask yourself the 
question <I>"Are there people in my past who
insisted that I not eat the 
foods I binge on and insisted I be thin?" How
much anger is there in a 
binge?</I> Begin to learn that you are in contr
ol of your life now and can 
eat whatever you want. You have that choice.
<B>Learn about nutrition</B> 
and <B>begin to eat three well-balanced
meals or perhaps 5 smaller ones 
throughout the day</B>. Allow yourself to
have a small portion of the food 
yo u like to binge on. Again you are the
one who controls how much, when, 
where. <I>Eat slowly, taste the food.
</I>Give yourself permission to 
<I>stop when you feel
full</I>.

<P>Feeling guilty after a binge often leads to a purge
which keeps the 
vicious cycle going. The above tips and strategies may
help you in 
understanding how you personally relate to food and how you
might remedy or 
eliminate problematic eating habits. Accept the full
feeling of the binge 
and learn from it.

<P><HR><P><H3> Helping a
Friend</H3>

<P>If you think a friend may have an eating disorder, you can
help by taking 
the following steps.
<DL>
<DT>1. Discuss your concerns
with a professional. Learn about eating 
disorders and available local
resources. Your campus or community counseling 
center is a good place to
start.
<DT>2. Talk to your friend. Keep the discussion informal and
confidential, 
and focus on your concerns about your friend's health, not
weight or 
appearance. Explain how the problem is affecting your
relationship. 
Mention that eating disorders can be treated successfully.
If your friend 
is able to acknowledge the problem, suggest some
resources.
<DT>3. Realize that you may be rejected. People with eating
disorders 
often deny their problem because
 they're afraid to admit they're out of 
control. Don't take the rejection
personally. and try to end the 
conversation in a way that will allow you
to come back to the subject at
 another time.
<DT>4. Know your limits. If
you sense that you're getting an gry or 
impatient, back off. And don't
take on the role of counselor or food 
monitor--it's inappropriate and
ineffectual.
</DL>

<HR><H3>A Note to Athletes</H3>

<P>Crash diets and
other quick weight loss techniques sap your strength. 
You may feel pressure to lose weight so that you can make a specific weight 
class, meet
weight restrictions, or look more attractive to the judges. 
You or your
coach may believe that rapid weight loss just before a meet 
will give you
a competitive edge, although no scientific evidence supports
this.
<P> What the evidence does show is crash dieting can make you
more prone 
to injury. And it's difficult to give your best if you feel
tired, dizzy, 
irritable, or depressed-all side-effects of rapid weight
loss. In a ddition, 
dieting and weight obsession can lead to anorexia and
bulimia.
<P> At some points in your athletic career you may
realistically need to 
slim down. If you determine, with advice from your
medical practitioner, 
that you do need to lose weight, set a realistic
goal generally not more 
than two pounds a week. The United States Olympic
Committee says that weight 
loss is only beneficial to an athlete if "the
weight goal and rate of 
weight loss are realistic and the diet is
balanced."
