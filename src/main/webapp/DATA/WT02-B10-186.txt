The focus of the research of this department is on adversity, stress, and psychiatric disorders. One of the important activities of the past year has been the editing of papers on this topic that were presented at the March 1994 annual meeting of the American Psychopathological Association. The program was organized by Dr. Dohrenwend and the papers will appear in a monograph to be published by the American Psychiatric Press. In addition, Drs. Dohrenwend and Skodol have been involved in organizing a symposium of the World Psychiatric Association Section of Epidemiology and Community Psychiatry to be held in New York May 15-17, 1995 on Search for the Causes of Psychiatric Disorders: Epidemiological Approaches. At the same time, three major investigations of adversity, stress, and psychiatric disorders have continued and planning has begun for two additional investigations. The following are brief descriptions of the on-going studies and of the plans for new research.

<B>On-going Studies</B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Social and Psychological Factors in Episodes of Schizophrenia and Major Depression  </B>This project has sought to determine the relative importance and specificity of three sets of factors (remote and recent life events, personal dispositions, situational contexts) for episodes of major depression by contrast with episodes of schizophrenic disorder.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Analyses of data collected under the above grant have continued even though a substantial number of papers have been previously published and reported and even though the NIMH-funded project period has ended. The retrospective case-control design of the project focuses on a sample of 96 major depressives, 65 persons with schizophrenia and other nonaffective psychotic disorders, and 404 controls from the general population. Data collection occurred in New York City. The most important analyses to date will be included in the book from the 1994 APPA meeting mentioned above. The results indicate, for example, that recent life events play a far more important role in the occurrence of episodes of major depression than in episodes of nonaffective psychotic disorders, including DSM-III schizophrenia, regardless of whether first episodes or recurrences are the outcomes being investigated.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Social Stress, Social Selection, and Psychiatric Disorders</B>  This on-going project started on January 1, 1982, with grant support from NIMH. Based on over two years of preliminary research, it involves study of the roles of social, psychological, and family history factors in the etiology of the main types of psychopathology that are inversely related to socioeconomic status: schizophrenia, major depression, substance use disorders, alcoholism, and antisocial personality.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Israel was chosen as the research setting for two main reasons: (1) it is an open class society in which ethnic assimilation is taking place as required by the theoretical framework of the study, and (2) a well-kept Population Register was available as an aid to the type of sampling that facilitates obtaining unbiased estimates of rates of disorder. From a screened and diagnosed probability sample of 4,914 young adults, 340 cases, 191 controls, and a sample of their adult siblings have been chosen for intensive study. Brief telephone interviews were conducted with most of these 531 persons following the Scud missile attacks on Israel during the Gulf War.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In previous years, we summarized major findings from the epidemiological study on the role of socioeconomic status that were published in the February 21, 1992 issue of Science and in descriptive analyses of the epidemiological data published in Psychological Medicine. Further descriptive analyses of the epidemiological data were published in 1994 in the Archives of General Psychiatry. Many of the main analyses of the case/control data have been conducted, along with some further analyses of data from the telephone interviews following the Scud attacks during the Gulf War. As in the New York study described above, some of the findings from the case/control study in Israel show that recent life events are more important in the occurrence of episodes of major depression than in exacerbations of schizophrenic disorder. The importance of this corroboration of the New York results is that the New York cases consisted of samples of patients whereas the research in Israel involves persons with these disorders who have been sampled from the general population. In addition to these similarities in the findings from the two studies on the relative importance of recent life events in the two disorders, some striking contrasts are also beginning to emerge, especially on the types of negative events involved in precipitating depression and in the role of family history in major depression. These will be written up along with other results from the case/control study in Israel during the following year and submitted for journal publication, as will results from the Scud follow-up.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Myofacial Pain Dysfunction Syndrome and Life Stress</B>  This project started in July 1, 1982 with grant support from NIDR. The first investigation was a longitudinal study of 136 pain patients and 131 controls. Detailed interviews were conducted with the respondents at entrance into the study and at monthly intervals for the period of one year. The purpose was to examine the role of environmental stress in episodes of myofascial pain. The main analyses have been completed, published, or accepted for publication.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The problems addressed in the second study have grown out of a finding from the first study that there are unusually high rates of major depression in the pain cases compared to controls. These results, consistent with findings from research by others on various types of chronic pain of unknown origin and depression, strongly indicate that the two are related. The results are equivocal about the direction of the relationship and, consequently, have not thrown much light on such competing theories as those suggesting that pain is "masked" depression or that depression is a reaction to the stress of chronic pain.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The aims in the second study, which started four years ago with a four-year competing continuation grant, involve an attempt to understand the relationship between depression and pain in persons suffering from temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome (TMPDS). To do so, an attempt is being made (1) to establish retrospectively the times of onset of depression and TMPDS in a new sample of TMPDS cases with and without a history of depression and (2) to investigate the rates of major depression in the adult first-degree relatives of the TMPDS cases and controls with and without a history of depression.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Field work has been completed with samples of 164 pain cases, 175 controls, and 225 first-degree relatives of these cases and controls. We expect to have major findings to report in the coming year.

<B>New Research Initiatives</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We are planning two new research initiatives that involve submission of substantial grant applications to NIMH. The first is a follow-up of respondents first interviewed an average of 12 years ago in the epidemiological research in Israel. Its purpose will be to build on the findings from the previous epidemiological and case/control studies by adding longitudinal and prospective components to the research.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second new undertaking involves the preparation of a grant application to analyze data previously collected by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in response to a Congressional mandate to investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychological problems in U.S. veterans of the war in Vietnam. RTI began this ground-<BR>
breaking study of nationwide samples of Vietnam Theater veterans, other Vietnam Era veterans, and nonveterans, totaling 3,016 respondents in 1984. The strikingly high rates of PTSD that they found in both male and female Theater veterans and the ethnic/racial differences in these rates virtually demand more analysis, and we plan to focus on these differences.
