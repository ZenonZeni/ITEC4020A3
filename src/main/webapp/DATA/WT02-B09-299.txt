Clive:
<P>
You better answer my e-mail one of these days, or I'll find 
myself another bass player.
<P>
Well . . . Another 45 minutes and I will have survived Week 1 
at my new job. 
<P>
There was a big company meeting on Wednesday, like some sort of 
fascist pep rally or something. Highbridge (I told you about 
him . . . small man, big ego) strides onstage dressed like 
Rambo. One of the vice presidents followed close behind with a 
pack of Dobermans foaming at the mouth. A dummy was tossed on 
stage and the VP let the dogs loose. But they went after 
Highbridge instead of the dummy. (Maybe someone said "get the 
dummy," and they got confused!) Apparently, Highbridge had 
rubbed hamburger on the dummy, but forgot to wash his hands. 
Fortunately, the doctors were able to re-attach his pinky. 
<P>
I like the technology guy, Victor Gooseggi. He's one of those 
brilliant émigrés from the former Soviet Union. Hoezbagistan, 
in fact. Remember, I got arrested at the demonstration outside 
the Hoezbagistan Embassy last year? Anyway, he has this 
charming habit of butchering Americanisms. I asked him why he 
looked so glum the other day and he said. "Oh it is to nothing. 
Is only I wake up on wrong side of dread." 
<P>
So when are you coming back? You said that Land Mine's "World" 
tour of the Upper Midwest was only going to last three weeks 
and you've been gone for almost two months. If you're not back 
soon, I'm going to shave off the rest of my hair.
<P>
Hold on, there seems to be some kind of commotion in the lobby 
. . . I'll be right back.
<P>
. . . whoa . . . gotta run. There are about 20 federal agents 
in the lobby and they've got a search warrant. Something about 
a violation of the transfer of military technologies act or 
something. More later . . . 
<P>
Much love,
<P>
Ravenna
