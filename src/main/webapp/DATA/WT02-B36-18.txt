DTI RAISES POSSIBILITY OF SHIPPERS' LEVY FOR TAKE-OR-PAY COSTS

The take or pay liabilities faced by British Gas continue to tax minds
and stir emotions in the industry.  While BG has taken on a chief
negotiator to "lead and direct the renegotiation of gas purchase
contracts", the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has dropped a
potential timebomb in the shape of a possible levy on shippers to cover
the extra cost of high-priced take-or-pay gas.  In addition, delays in
the drafting of licences for shippers and public gas transporters and
the associated transfer documents and special licence conditions have
meant the Appointed Day has slipped from 1 February to 1 March.  This
has raised concerns over a potential delay to the domestic competition
pilot scheme, due to start in the south-west on 1 April.

At a high-level panel meeting between shippers, BG TransCo and Ofgas
last Saturday (6 January), DTI head of oil and gas John Michell
outlined verbally a new Condition 12 for the shippers' licence,
currently being redrafted for release "very soon".  This would allow
the Secretary of State to impose a levy on shippers, via the
transportation charge, to financially benefit suppliers with long-term
take-or-pay obligations.  The size of this levy is not certain,
although 1p or 2p a therm has been mooted.  It is uncertain also quite
how this levy would be passed from TransCo to the appropriate supplier
and whether the recipient will be just British Gas Supply.

While everyone in the industry is waiting to see a written version of
the proposal before giving a considered response, this "Top Gas" type
scheme, similar to that used in Canada, raised initial alarm with both
shippers, who questioned why they should pay for BG's problems, and
with the Gas Consumers Council which feared customers would pick up the
tab.  The last minute nature of the addition of condition 12 means
there will be little time to consider its full implications.  BG said
it remained keen to reach agreement with producers over renegotiated
contracts, but it considered the levy proposal to be a useful
contingency plan.

British Gas has indicated that the first producers to agree to
renegotiate contracts with BG will get best terms.  So far North Sea
producers have shown no inclination to revamp long term take-or-pay
contracts to supply BG at prices well above current competitive market
levels.  The job of BG's new chief negotiator Kenneth Gardener, a
director of Charterhouse Bank, is to persuade producers to come to the
table.  Gardener, who took on his new post on 1 January, has given up
executive duties at Charterhouse but remains a director.

On his appointment last month he acknowledged producers would be
reluctant to re-open legally binding contracts but said he believed a
"win win" position could emerge from negotiations.  He has agreed to
give at least two years to the problem.  BG also underlined the
increased significance of legal issues in its affairs with the
appointment of William Friedrich, formerly with international law firm
Shearman & Sterling, as its general counsel.

Levy proposal

The DTI is maintaining that its levy proposal is still under
consideration and would be included in the licence on a contingency
basis only.  No decision has been made as to whether the condition
would be invoked.  The government may be using it as a threat to
producers to encourage them to sit down with BG to renegotiate
contracts.  However, this could backfire if producers feel they risk
being hit with a "double whammy" whereby they accept a lower price for
gas from BG and are then hit by a levy because other producers have
been unwilling to renegotiate.  Thus the messages coming from the DTI
appear somewhat confusing.

The Gas Consumers Council is concerned that a levy will keep prices for
domestic customers higher than a free market would otherwise deliver.
Council director Ian Powe said: "Contingency provision for a levy on
all shippers would, if implemented, be passed on to consumers in prices
higher than they would otherwise pay.  It must not be seen as anything
more than an insurance policy against British Gas' failure to sort out
its own problems.  Customers can accept no blame for this predicament.
We would need to have very different information than we have now in
order to concede that any of British Gas' contractual liabilities
should be passed on to its own and other suppliers' customers".  The
Council has asked for full disclosure of all facts before any levy is
imposed and on 12 December proposed that the House of Commons Trade and
Industry Committee should conduct an enquiry into public interest
issues arising from BG's take-or-pay commitments.

BG is now working on the transferal of its supply contracts (and the
related take-or-pay obligations) to a new subsidiary.  Under the new
Gas Act the same company is not allowed to act as a public gas
transporter and gas supplier.  This restructuring will take place on
the Appointed Day.  During debate of the Gas Bill, producers expressed
concern that BG would be able to offload its take-or-pay liabilities
into a number of subsidiaries without proper guarantees.  Amendments to
the Act mean there will be a single trading subsidiary, but some
questions still remain over the fact that this subsidiary will have no
parent guarantee.  How will the DTI ensure the long-term funding and
solvency of the subsidiary to make sure it is not allowed to fall into
bankruptcy to avoid take-or-pay commitments?

Appointed Day

Another important issue discussed at the panel meeting was the timing
of the Appointed Day for licences and introduction of the Network Code.
 DTI confirmed that while a final draft of the suppliers' licence had
been issued, the shippers' licence still needed completion of the
controversial condition 12.  Michell said the public gas transporters'
licence, the transfer scheme and special licence conditions had slipped
badly in the drafting timetable, due to the time required to turn
policy into legal drafting, as opposed to policy difficulties.
Slaughter and May was working on the special conditions, but he was not
entirely confident that all the licence documentation would be in place
by 1 February, the proposed Appointed Day.  Accordingly it was agreed
that the Appointed Day should be moved to 1 March, with a panel meeting
on 2 February to confirm this date.  Energy balancing will be
introduced from 1 September.

The big question is how this delay will affect the proposed 1 April
date for the introduction of the domestic competition pilot scheme.
While it is the job of the Domestic Competition Steering Group, chaired
by Clare Spottiswoode, to discuss this issue, it was agreed at the
panel meeting that TransCo should continue with its current timetable
for systems implementation and testing.  SPA is already under trial,
and nomination and confirmation of all sites by shippers will utilise
the SPA system from 1 February.  The Gti system would not be used for a
start date of supply beyond 1 February, but would be retained for
invoicing purposes.  While some shippers were still concerned over the
accuracy of their sites and meters portfolios, most felt they were
workable and were not a reason for delay, as long as a suitable
reconciliation process for disputes was established.  Dual billing of
sites was being tackled among the shippers themselves, but some sites
remained without any nomination.

The running and testing of SPA is seen by many shippers as one of the
most important systems steps for the domestic trial, and suppliers such
as Amerada Hess and Total, who are committed to participating in the
first trial, remain optimistic that the 1 April date can be maintained.
 However, TransCo itself has been giving conflicting messages over its
attitude to the timing of the pilot.  Having originally requested six
months between the implementation of the Network Code and the domestic
competition pilot, in order to test systems thoroughly, TransCo had
reluctantly agreed to first a four-month and then a two-month gap.  The
shift from 1 February to 1 March for Network Code implementation means
the gap will narrow to one month, although systems testing will be
underway before the official start date.

Systems failure

While some in TransCo appear to have indicated a willingness to
consider this option, managing director Harry Moulson came out very
strongly in favour of delaying the pilot in a Times interview this
week.  He suggested the introduction of domestic competition should be
delayed until June because the computer system is untried and could
fail.  He said it would be "ludicrous" to press ahead with the trial in
April, as there were significant risks, including the worst outcome
where a breakdown left TransCo unable to maintain pipeline pressure.  A
more likely risk, he suggested, would be an inability for TransCo to
confirm meter readings if too many customers wished to switch supplier.
 He also admitted that TransCo's service to its customers had been
"bloody awful" last year, and although it was improving he felt there
was a way to go.

Ofgas has indicated there should be "a searching review to determine
why the 1 April date cannot be retained for the introduction of the
domestic market".  Chris Rees from Touche Ross has been taken on as a
"troubleshooter" reporting to Ofgas, to examine whether the 1 April
deadline is feasible or whether the start-up date should be delayed by
a month or two.  He is currently visiting interested parties and is
expected to make his recommendation in late February.  It is likely the
introduction will be on a quota or rationed basis, with say a maximum
of 1,000 confirmations per day in the early days to minimise system
strain.

BG RANKED SIXTH IN SURVEY OF OVERALL GAS COMPANY PROFITABILITY

British Gas ranks sixth in terms of overall composite profitability in
comparison with 159 gas companies surveyed worldwide in 1994, according
to a survey* compiled by the Sheffield Energy & Resources Information
Services (SERIS).  Based on 1992-1994 information, the survey uses
operating and financial data to rank the upstream and downstream
activities of gas companies in 48 countries, according to 25
competition and performance indicators.  The information is also used
to compile a profitability index, headed in 1994 by Statoil as the top
performing company, against which the remaining companies are measured
(see table).  In the index the company's absolute profit, profit margin
and rate of return on assets are combined and given equal weight.
However, SERIS points out that the accuracy of the information is
dependent on the operations of each company and on its willingness to
disclose such data.

In compiling the survey, SERIS considered each company's upstream
operations and downstream gas pipeline and marketing segments, and used
the information to rank the following companies:

* top five gas production companies in 1994: Russia's Gazprom with
20,150.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf), Algeria's Sonatrach (4,569.8 Bcf),
Indonesia's Pertamina (2,661.0 Bcf), the UK's Royal Dutch/Shell Group
(2,574.0 Bcf) and Saudi Arabia's Saudi Aramco (2,479.1 Bcf);

* top five companies for gas pipeline sales in 1994: Dutch company
Nederlandse Gasunie with 2,899.4 Bcf, Germany's Ruhrgas (2,006.1 Bcf),
Italy's ENI subsidiary SNAM (1,707.9 Bcf), France's Gaz de France
(1,329.5 Bcf) and the US's Tenneco (870.5 Bcf).  British Gas, in second
place in SERIS's 1993 ranking, declined to disclose a figure for gas
sales because of "the commercial sensitivity of the data in the run up
to competition in the gas market".  Similarly, British Gas's market
rivals were equally unwilling to disclose figures to SERIS;

* top five companies for total gas pipeline throughput volume in 1994
(gas pipeline sales plus gas transported for third parties): Canada's
Nova Corp with 4,089.0 Bcf, the US's Tenneco (3,328.0 Bcf), Nederlandse
Gasunie (3,164.2 Bcf), Slovakia's Slovak Gas Industry (SPP) (2,765.0
Bcf) and the US's Panhandle Eastern Corporation (2,498.0 Bcf).  British
Gas's figures for throughput volume (2,197 Bcf) put the company into
eighth place in 1994 compared with fifth place in 1993;

* top five companies for gas marketing sales in 1994 (sales of bought-
in third party gas by marketing subsidiaries): US company Enron Corp
with 2,489.6 Bcf, the US's Natural Gas Clearinghouse (1,286.0 Bcf),
Canada's Transcanada Pipelines Ltd (1,171.3 Bcf), the US's Panhandle
Eastern Corp (1,134.6 Bcf) and the US's Coastal Corp (989.0 Bcf);

* top five most profitable gas companies in absolute terms in 1994:
Italy's SNAM, with an operating profit of US$1,920m, British Gas with
$1,356m, Gaz de France with $872.8m, Transcanada Pipelines with $733.9m
and Norway's Statoil with $603.4m.

SOME GAS PRICES LINKED TO PRICE OF ELECTRICITY

It appears some companies supplying gas to power plants have been
offering contracts where the gas price is linked to the price of
electricity in the pool, thus protecting generators from a price
squeeze following changes in the electricity price.

This is seen as a marketing tool to secure sales in a market under
pressure from falling gas prices and surplus supplies.  It carries
risks of large losses for the gas supplier and such deals may be
offered at a premium.

Scottish Hydro is one generator that is believed to have agreed a gas
contract with around 40% linked to the electricity pool price.

Gas prices are more usually linked to an indicator such as the retail
price index.

UK ENERGY PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION

Provisional statistics showing energy production and consumption in the
three months September to November 1995, published by the Department of
Trade and Industry, show that production of indigenous primary fuels,
at 67.9 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) was 5.4% higher than in
the corresponding period a year ago.

Production of coal, natural gas, primary electricity and petroleum rose
by 12.0%, 7.8%, 4.3% and 3.2% respectively.  Deep-mined coal was 21.0%
higher than in the same period a year ago as the newly privatised
companies increased production.

Total inland consumption of primary fuels, which includes deliveries
into consumption, during the three months September to November 1995,
at 52.9 mtoe was 0.6% less than in the same period a year ago.

Consumption of natural gas increased by 9.0% largely due to low
consumption in November 1994 because of exceptionally mild weather, and
a significant increase in use for electricity generation in September
to November 1995, compared with the same period a year earlier.

Consumption of petroleum and coal fell by 3.7% and 9.7% respectively.

BRITISH GAS TO DRILL OFF THE LANCASHIRE COAST

British Gas Exploration and Production (E&P) is to drill an exploration
well some 11 kilometres southwest of Formby Point on the Lancashire
Coast.  This will be the fifth well it has drilled in exploration block
110/14.

A jack-up drilling rig, the Global Adriatic XI, will be towed to
location and will drill to a depth of approximately 1,350 metres
beneath the seabed.  Drilling will last about two weeks.

The target reservoir is the same as the Morecambe fields, already
developed by British Gas.  An extensive survey of the area was
undertaken before the decision was made to drill, said BGE&P.

British Gas is the main acreage holder in the Irish Sea, currently
operating 19 blocks in the East Irish Sea, North Channel and Caernarvon
Bay, and participating in four others in the East Irish Sea.

OFGAS SEMINAR ON PREPAYMENT METERS

Ofgas held another seminar last month at the Church House Conference
Centre, this time to discuss and seek views on the thorny issue of
access by future domestic gas suppliers to prepayment meters.

Suppliers need access to prepayment technology to be able to meet their
licence obligations. The current Quantum System is viewed as the only
realistic technology for the competitive market, however it is a system
firmly stamped with the BG logo.

The aim of the seminar was to discuss and get agreement on what has
been called a short term solution to allow prepayment  supply from the
start of a competitive gas market, but which is not necessarily the
long term solution.

The main thrust appears to suggest suppliers will need to agree among
themselves a series of prices for gas supplied through a prepayment
meter.

Data constraints in the Quantum System, which was originally designed
for an integrated supplier, mean that it would be difficult and costly
for each supplier to have its own individual price.

BG TRANSCO PROPOSES HIGHER RANGE FOR COST OF CAPITAL ESTIMATES

BG TransCo has published a paper on its cost of capital, the first in a
series that will consider specific elements of the current price
control formula review.  The paper has been made public to stimulate
debate and add transparency to the process, said TransCo.  It concludes
that the range for TransCo's cost of capital, or allowed rate of
return, is now 7.4%-8.9%, with the actual cost towards the upper end of
this range.  This compares with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
1993 enquiry which estimated the range for TransCo's cost of capital
was 6.5%-7.5% pre-tax.

In a letter to Ofgas director general Clare Spottiswoode, TransCo
managing director Harry Moulson said the change in estimate is partly
due to factors exogenous to TransCo including the MMC's revised figures
for the equity risk premium and changes to the advance corporation tax.
 However, he suggests a more specific reason is a change in the
riskiness of TransCo relative to the stock market as a whole.  He said
the beta coefficient had become more volatile and had risen to a value
in the range 0.83-0.93, compared with the MMC beta estimate of 0.86.

Moulson suggests this increase reflects changing market and regulatory
conditions and is likely to continue over the next few years.
Separation of transportation and trading and the introduction of
competition have increased the market-related risk of transportation.
The report suggests "the systematic risk that TransCo faces is
comparatively high in relation to other utilities.  On a qualitative
assessment of the market risk facing utility companies, TransCo ranks
higher than the water and electricity companies, but lower than
telecommunications".  TransCo argues that the company should therefore
have a higher cost of capital, towards the upper end of the range of
7.4%-8.9%.  It suggests "failure to provide this will be to the
detriment of the financial viability of the business and will undermine
incentives to invest".

TransCo is organising a seminar early this year, to which it will
invite Ofgas, shippers and academics to discuss its analysis.  It
intends to publish a second paper on the asset base for consideration.

DECEMBER 1995 FIRM GAS PRICES NEARLY 30% LOWER THAN YEAR BEFORE

A sample of prices from clients of energy specialists John Hall
Associates showed that for customers using more than 25,000 therms per
year, the volume weighted average firm gas price in December 1995 of
18.72 pence per therm was down 3.01 ppt on the previous month (21.73
ppt) and 3.25 ppt below October's average price.  This December price
was down 7.81 ppt (29.4%) compared with the same month the year before
(December 1994, 26.53 ppt).  However, JHA points out that prices for
currently renewable firm gas contracts are significantly lower at
around 11.5 to 12.0 ppt for customers with good volume and load factor,
a little below the levels in November.

The December 1995 volume weighted price of firm gas in the markets
below 25,000 therms was 23.97 ppt, according to Hall sample figures.
This is 7.95 ppt (24.9%) below the price in the same month the year
before (December 1994, 31.92 ppt), and 1.45 ppt lower than the previous
month's figure (November 1995, 25.42 ppt).  New contracts are being
quoted as low as 15 ppt, or even lower if attached to above 25,000
therm volumes, according to JHA.

At 15.11 pence per therm (ppt), the volume weighted average price of
interruptible gas in December 1995 was down 0.36 ppt on the price the
month before (15.47 ppt) and 0.43 ppt less than the average price in
October (15.54 ppt).  This average December 1995 price is 4.40 ppt
below the average price in the same month in 1994 (19.51 ppt) - a
reduction of 22.6%.   As with firm gas prices, the best interruptible
prices for new contract business are considerably lower at between 10
and 11 ppt, with prices having stabilised over the last few months of
1995.

Having remained steady at around 9.05 to 9.10 ppt during late October
and early November, spot gas prices rose sharply in the last half of
November to break through the 10.00 ppt barrier, based on Bacton
prices.  Prices have since stabilised around 9.95 to 10.15 ppt, with
some increases seen during the period of cold weather.

The discount for supplies from St Fergus compared with Bacton was
around 0.20 to 0.25 ppt until around mid November, when it increased to
over 0.30 ppt.  During December, the discount tended to be around 0.2
ppt.  Prices for the first quarter of 1996, based on Bacton, were
around 10.2 ppt in late December, with the differential between St
Fergus and Bacton ranging between 0.45 and 0.65 ppt during the month.

IRISH INTERCONNECTORS FACE FLAK ON SAFETY AND ECONOMIC GROUNDS

Following a demand from George Foulkes MP for a public enquiry into
safety aspects of the construction by British Gas of the Scotland-
Northern Ireland gas pipeline, the Scottish Office has released results
of its preliminary underwater survey.  Concern had been expressed that
recent pipelaying work had disturbed Second World War explosives dumped
in and around Beaufort's Dyke in the Irish Sea.

Phosphorus flares have been washed up along the south-west Scottish
coast, and the British Geological Survey reported underwater explosions
in this area of the Irish Sea.  The Scottish Office report shows that
munitions were strewn in and around Beaufort's Dyke, sometimes in
relatively shallow water, but concluded there was no risk to the public
or marine life.

Offshore pipelaying work by Premier Transco, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of British Gas, was halted briefly in late October, but the prohibition
order was lifted by the Health and Safety Executive after five days (UK
Gas Report, issue 47, 3 November 1995, page 4), allowing the company to
finish laying, trenching and pressure testing of the complete offshore
section of the pipe.

A Premier Transco spokesman told UK Gas Report 42 kms of 24 inch pipe
had been laid and some work had been completed on the onshore section
in Scotland.  This work had been suspended during the winter for
environmental reasons, to reduce land damage, and would resume in the
spring, together with work on the 3km onshore link to the Ballylumford
power plant in Northern Ireland.

He said the project was on schedule for completion in October this
year.  Planning permission had also been given for a pipeline to
Carrickfergus to allow the development of a downstream gas market in
Northern Ireland (UK Gas Report, issue 47, 3 November 1995, page 12).
He anticipated the first customers could be supplied with natural gas
by the end of the year.  It is believed that competition in supply for
industrial and commercial customers will be introduced three years
after the start of operations, with full competition after eight years.

Premier Transco has always claimed its offshore pipelaying work posed
no threat to safety or health and had been carried out in accordance
with government safety procedures.  The Scottish Office suggested more
research was needed to see if there was a conclusive link between work
on the pipeline and the emergence of up to 4,000 incendiary bombs on
local beaches.  Commissioning and operation of the pipeline will be
discussed by Premier Transco, the Scottish Office and the Health and
Safety Executive, and Transco says it will continue to act in
accordance with procedures agreed with the DTI, HSE and Ministry of
Defence.  Foulkes and environmental groups have condemned the survey as
being held too late and in the wrong place.

Meanwhile, Ireland's Department of Energy (DoE) has been criticised for
its role in the completed Scotland-Southern Ireland gas interconnector
pipeline, with claims by the country's Comptroller and Auditor General
that the department got its figures wrong in its estimates for the
$373.5m line.  The comptroller, in a report to the government on the
pipeline, says the DoE made serious blunders in its calculations at the
planning stage of the interconnector.  Administration and design cost
$41.2m, some 45% more than budgeted for, while entire costs overran by
$16.5m.  This the comptroller says, was reasonable.  "The $16.5m
represents a reasonable overrun because the scale and complexity of the
project made cost estimation particularly difficult and also because
extra work above that envisaged had to be undertaken."

However, the DoE is blamed for faulty estimates on its rate of return
to the Irish economy, initially estimated at between 23% and 39% but
eventually found to be only around 15% by the EU which assessed the
project for grant aid.  The comptroller found the rate of return to the
economy to be even lower at only 11%.  The department based its rate of
return calculations on costs of $300m at 1990 prices but sought
government approval for the project based on costs of $360m.  In
addition, no provision was made in estimates of project returns for the
foreseeable costs of developing and upgrading existing natural gas
infrastructure, estimated at $240m.

Controversy continues in Ireland over this interconnector, with critics
claiming it is unnecessary and that had Southern Ireland been patient
it could have taken an overland spur from the British Gas
interconnector at a modest cost of around $45m or less.  However,
others argue that the separate pipeline provides valuable security in
alternative supply options.

BG FACES CLAIMS FROM SERVICE CONTRACT CUSTOMERS LEFT IN COLD

British Gas has confirmed that it will compensate domestic customers
covered under its Three Star Service contracts, after repair services
were severely disrupted by freezing weather conditions over the
Christmas period.  The company faced widespread criticism after an
estimated 150,000 of the 3m customers covered by the #104 contract -
the most expensive and popular of four service agreements offered by
British Gas - were left without heating for up to four days.  Under the
terms of the agreement, British Gas pledges to send an engineer to
repair a faulty system within 24 hours if the fault is reported before
7.30am and depending on demand.

According to a spokesman, British Gas plans to "consider each case on
its individual merit" but will award #10 for each day after the 24 hour
call-out period that a contract customer awaited an engineer.  The
company added that it will consider paying costs incurred by customers
covered by the service who were forced to use another company to carry
out repairs.

The Gas Consumers Council criticised British Gas for the delays which
it said were due to the company's redundancy and restructuring
programme.  The Council added that British Gas had failed to make
contingency plans to cope with the cold period after the Council had
warned the company in early December of potential disruption to
services due to staff shortages.  Ian Powe, director of the Council,
said the problem was "fundamental" rather than seasonal, with
complaints about British Gas service contracts trebling in the year
ending November 1995.  He suggested BG should amend the terms of its
three-star contracts or take on more engineers to provide a better
service to justify the high cost.

Responding to the criticism, British Gas said the number of engineers
operating in 1995 (7,500) was the same as in 1993, and that all
businesses had been affected by the extreme weather conditions.  A BG
spokesman added that during the disruptions, priority had been given to
"customers most in need, particularly the elderly and families with
young children and households suffering from a complete central heating
breakdown".

REGULATORS GIVEN DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES AS REVIEWS CONTINUE

Utility regulation is under the spotlight once again as the London
Stock Exchange issues guidelines for regulators releasing sensitive
information and the Labour Party sets up its policy review of energy
regulation.  In addition, it appears the Committee on Standards in
Public Life, chaired by Lord Nolan, may include utility regulation in
its wide-ranging remit.

The London Stock Exchange guidelines conclude a review of the control
of information which could affect the share prices of companies under
the supervision of privatised utility regulators.  Last summer, a row
erupted when information on price controls provided by electricity
director general Professor Stephen Littlechild to regional electricity
companies was leaked, causing a crash in electricity share prices.  The
new guidelines have been drawn up with the agreement of regulators in
the fields of gas, electricity, water, telecommunications, rail,
aviation, environment, television, gaming, and the Lottery.  The Office
of Fair Trading, although not an industry regulator in the same sense,
has agreed to the same guidelines.

The guidelines include:

* a minimum period - not normally more than 24 hours - between giving
sensitive information to a company and its advisers and releasing it
publicly;

* limitation of access to information on a need-to-know basis;

* advice to be given to other parties on the confidential nature of
information;

* lists to be kept of people to whom information has been shown in
advance;

* notification to the Stock Exchange and companies simultaneously;

* consultation with the exchange in the case of a leak, and if
appropriate, immediate release of information.

However, the voluntary guidelines have a get-out clause in that the
exchange recognises that regulators may not always be able to stick "to
the strict letter of these guidelines".  Critics have also suggested
that the guidelines would not have stopped the electricity price
control leak last year, as Offer officials claim they were already pre-
releasing sensitive information no more than 24 hours before
publication.  Some suggest that only simultaneous release of
information to companies and to the exchange could really guard against
that kind of price manipulation.

Richard Kilsby, director of market services at the exchange, said the
new guidelines would "help to prevent disorderly markets and potential
insider dealing in shares of regulated companies before the official
release of sensitive information by the regulators".

Meanwhile, the Labour Party has begun work on its review of energy
regulation, headed by shadow energy minister John Battle.  He believes
the current structure of regulation has failed the customer in terms of
service and prices and is lacking in transparency and consistency.
Labour is thought to favour a single energy regulator served by a panel
of advisers.  A group of industry specialists is being recruited by the
Party to draft a new regulatory framework.  The subject may also come
under further scrutiny by the current government if Lord Nolan decides
to include utility regulation in this year's programme for the
standards in public life committee.  The recent row over the behaviour
of the Lottery watchdog chief has raised again questions of
accountability and standards for regulators.

CONTRACTING ACTIVITY IN DECEMBER STIRS UP JHA MARKET SHARE FIGURES

Figures provided during December to John Hall Associates (JHA) by firm
gas clients using more than 25,000 therms/yr show some significant
changes in market share, reflecting an increase in activity in December
when many of the contracts on the database were due for renewal.

Mobil remains the market leader in this sector, although it lost 1% to
hold a 22% share.  Kinetica gained 1% to 16%, taking over second place
in the sample from Alliance which dropped 6% to 13%.  Eastern Gas
(eGas) saw its recent aggressive marketing pay dividends with a 6% rise
in share to 11%.  AGAS and Quadrant each gained 1% to 8% and 5%
respectively, while Amerada Hess lost 2% to reach 7% of this market in
December.  The "others" category also fell back 1% on the database.

Similarly, within the sub-25,000 therm sector, there was some movement
in market share figures during December.  Alliance remains the major
player, although its share fell 4% to 30% of the non-BG market in the
JHA sample.  Quadrant (including Gas Direct) maintained its overall 22%
on the database, while eGas gained 1% to 10%.  The "others" category
rose 3% to 10%.

A breakdown of figures provided to JHA by interruptible customers
during December shows a sharp increase in eGas' market share, gaining
4% to reach 17% of the total in the sample database.  Using the JHA
database that now excludes single sites of over 100m therms per year
consumption, Business Gas' (BG Supply's) share of the interruptible
market stayed at 25% in December, while Amerada Hess increased by 1%.

Alliance Gas remains a dominant force in this sector, although it lost
4% to register a 24% share in the December JHA sample.  Alliance showed
falls in all market sectors on the database, reflecting JHA's
perception that the company had been much less prominent during the
latest contracting round.  Alliance told UK Gas Report it had been
considering each renewal carefully in the light of tightening margins,
but it had not changed its policy and was not withdrawing from any
markets.  Other significant players in the interruptible gas market
include United Gas (7%), Accord (6%) and Quadrant (5%).  AGAS, Mobil
and Amerada Hess each have a 4% share on the JHA interruptible
database.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION ADOPTS ENERGY POLICY WHITE PAPER

At a meeting on 19 December, the European Commission adopted energy
commissioner Christos Papoustis' proposal for a white paper, entitled
"An energy policy for the European Union", which lays down guidelines
for EU energy policy into the next decade.  However, Papoustis raised
the question of whether it will be possible to achieve the white
paper's objectives without the addition of an Energy Chapter to the
European Treaty - currently the subject of ongoing discussions.

The white paper is the outcome of detailed discussions and
consultations held on the EC's green paper, which was published in
January 1995.  It sets out three strategic objectives for EU energy
policy: overall competitiveness; security of energy supply; and
environmental protection.  To achieve its objectives, the white paper
has established a number of policy guidelines, the first of which is
integration of energy markets.  Liberalisation of the internal market
for electricity and for natural gas is considered to be the key factor
in market integration.

The second policy guideline deals with concerns over the increasing
energy dependency of the EU.  However, the Commission feels that
despite the political risks in some important supplier countries and
growing world energy consumption, security of supply does not at
present warrant crisis measures.  Instead, the Commission will aim to
encourage fuel diversification, energy efficiency and renewable energy
sources as a means of helping to preserve security of supply.

The Commission sees no inherent conflict between improving
competitiveness and protecting the environment and recognises that the
internalisation of environmental costs and benefits offers a way to
integrate environmental concerns by working with the market rather than
against it.  The need to promote sustainable development means the
Commission will seek to encourage energy efficiency and the use of
renewables via a range of policy instruments.  The Commission also
agreed that the role of local authorities should be given more
recognition in national and Community energy policies, as many aspects
of energy policy affect local communities.

Speaking at the meeting where the white paper was adopted, Commissioner
Papoustis said: "A sound and sustainable energy policy is critical for
our future economic development.  This white paper will be our blue-
print for action into the 21st century".  Papoustis outlined the
importance of the paper's objectives to achieve environmental
protection, secure energy supplies, job creation, industrial
competitiveness and balanced regional development.  However, he said:
"If we are to achieve all these objectives, the Commission must raise
the question of whether a modification of the Treaty is necessary, as
Community action is now limited by the absence of clear provisions".

ONSET OF WINTER SEES N.SEA GAS OUTPUT SURGE IN NOVEMBER 1995

British gas production was up 51% in November over the month before,
and 25% higher than in November 1994, according to the latest Royal
Bank of Scotland Oil and Gas Index.  Production reached 8,551 million
cubic feet per day (MMcfd), taking the bank's gas index to 251.6.  Gas
sales were helped not only by the colder weather but also increasing
demand for electricity generation, said the bank.  Gas revenues were
estimated to have risen by #5.17 million a day to #15.86 million a day
during November last year, about 28% higher than in the same month in
1994.  Gas production was at its highest level since March last year.

British Gas' Morecambe field saw the largest increase in output, up 754
MMcfd to 1,325 MMcfd in November.  BP's Bruce field was up by 195 MMcfd
to 667 MMcfd.  Hamilton's Ravenspurn field increased by 194 MMcfd to
291 MMcfd, Marathon's East Brae was up 150 MMcfd to 438 MMcfd, Shell's
Sole Pit field output rose by 136 MMcfd to 339 MMcfd and Shell and
Amoco's Indefatigable field produced 311 MMcfd, up 70 MMcfd on October.
 BP's Cleeton field came back into strong production, rising from just
1 MMcfd to 197 MMcfd.

There were few falls in production, but Mobil's Beryl and Conoco's
Murdoch fields fell by 43 MMcfd to 372 MMcfd and by 41 MMcfd to 38
MMcfd respectively.  At the terminals higher production saw Bacton and
Barrow increase throughput by 752 MMcfd and 754 MMcfd respectively.
Easington increased by 483 MMcfd.

ROUND TABLE CALLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN ENERGY LIBERALISATION

The UK Round Table on Sustainable Development will shortly publish a
report giving broad support for energy market liberalisation, but
calling on the government to set a framework which ensures that energy
markets operate in a way that is consistent with sustainable
development.

The round table is a government appointed committee, set up to provide
advice to the government on sustainable development in the wake of the
Rio environmental conference.  It is chaired by secretary of state for
the environment, John Gummer, and includes representatives from
business, environmental organisations and academics.

At its meeting on 11 December, the round table suggested the
development of competitive markets should increase efficiency of
production and supply and generally provide benefits of reduced prices
and better services for customers.  However, it felt that the market
would not of itself meet all the environmental and social objectives of
a sustainable energy policy.

For this reason the round table concluded that the government should
set objectives and be prepared to use economic instruments, incentives
and regulation where necessary, to ensure that liberalisation is
achieved in the context of a sustainable energy policy.

EUROGAS SLAMS COMMISSION DIRECTIVE ON INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING

The proposed European Commission directive on integrated resource
planning (IRP), aiming to introduce rational planning techniques in the
electricity and gas distribution sectors, is "unnecessary, potentially
harmful and discriminatory, as far as gas is concerned" according to
the European Union of the Natural Gas Industry, Eurogas.

The group calls for the directive to be withdrawn and for EU policy to
focus on developing economic conditions, to encourage energy efficiency
through a competitive, commercial market structure.

Eurogas' main objection to the IRP directive proposal, which covers
rational planning activities in both the gas and electricity sectors,
is that it fails to take account of recent efforts by the gas industry
to increase efficient, economic and environmentally acceptable energy
supply and consumption.

These include end-user instruction on efficient energy use, the
promotion of energy audits, R&D into and increased use of energy
efficient appliances and plant, and cooperation with the construction
industry to encourage energy efficient housing, according to Eurogas.

Eurogas also believes an IRP directive is "potentially harmful" since
it threatens to intervene in market conditions where the need for
additional regulation is "not explained or documented".  In particular,
Eurogas says, commercial competition encourages the development of
efficient energy services, especially where companies must compete
against other energies to offer "best economic conditions to their
customers' needs, which includes energy efficiency and low cost, and
which applies to gas as much as to the alternative fuels".

Furthermore, the proposal is unfairly biased towards gas and excludes
other energies which compete in the same market and on balance
"contribute for each unit of energy produced more to greenhouse gas
emissions", said Eurogas.  Bearing in mind that the objective of the
IRP directive proposal is to reduce emissions, Eurogas feels that the
energy efficient merits of gas over other energies such as oil should
be given greater consideration.

Finally, the group points out that the directive "ignores and
misrepresents the actual situation in the European energy market" by
referring to out-of-date studies relating to electricity.

Instead, Eurogas calls on the Commission to compile a comprehensive
study of Europe's energy market needs and of possible initiatives to
"support existing policies and practices promoting energy efficiency in
the market place", with a view to publishing the findings as a
Commission Communication or Recommendation.

POWERGEN CHP CONTRACT TO SUPPLY CONOCO'S HUMBER REFINERY

PowerGen CHP Ltd has been awarded a contract to supply the electricity
and steam requirements of Conoco Ltd's Humber Refinery.

The contract, which reflects a long-term commercial relationship
between the companies, will involve the construction of a new gas-fired
combined heat and power plant rated at 24 megawatts electrical and over
90 megawatts thermal.

The CHP plant - with capital costs of almost #23 million - will feature
four independent gas turbines with back-up systems to ensure continuous
running even when the primary gas supply is unavailable.

To coincide with the plant construction, a connection between the
refinery and the existing Theddlethorpe to Killingholme gas pipeline
will be installed by Kinetica, the PowerGen/Conoco joint venture.

PowerGen CHP managing director Bob Kennett said: "We have broken new
ground in meeting the requirements of Conoco for efficient but flexible
plant.  Both parties can be confident that the energy supply will
support the refinery's demands in future."

STATOIL CONSIDERING SELLING ESTUARY FUELS

Statoil is thought to be considering selling its Irish oil and gas oil
importer, Estuary Fuels Ltd, which it acquired recently when it took
over Aran Energy, the Dublin explorer.

Estuary is 80% owned by Statoil, with the remainder held by Irish
farmer co-ops who are thought to be keen to liquidate their holdings
and diversify into CHP.

Estuary leases 44 petrol filling stations in the south and south west
of Ireland and owns a further two.

Two potential buyers are thought to have considered Estuary prior to
the successful Statoil bid for Aran, and Bord na Mona, the state peat
producer, is considered a likely buyer.

Bord na Mona is keen to diversify into other energy markets, including
gas.  The peat company was recently freed of most of its debt mountain
by the Irish government, and is managed by Dr. Eddie O'Connor, formerly
head of energy supply purchasing at state electricity company, ESB.

NESTE TO SELL ITS 50% SHARE IN SOVEREIGN

Following the completion of the sale of Neste's UK oil assets to Sands
Petroleum AB, Neste Oy, the Finnish oil, energy and chemicals company,
has agreed to sell its 50% share in Sovereign Exploration Ltd to
Northgas Ltd, a subsidiary of Northern Electric plc.

In January 1994 Neste and Northern Electric formed an upstream gas
company based on Neste's Southern Gas Basin interests, including the
Victor gas field (UK Gas Report, issue 4, 28 January 1994, page 1).

In addition to Victor, Sovereign Exploration has holdings in the
Schooner field which starts production at the end of 1996 and in the
Windermere development.

Neste has stated its intention to focus its upstream activities on
Norway, the Middle East and Russia.  Coinciding with the sale of its UK
activities, Neste is relocating its international business unit (which
is responsible for activities in the Middle East) from London to new
offices in Dubai.

IRISH BOTTLED GAS COMPANY TRADING PROFITABLY

Blugas plc, the Irish bottled gas company that fell into surprise half
year losses of Ir.#400,000 to the end of September last, now says it is
trading profitably, having shed top management and drafted in
accountants to manage the company short term.

However, part or the entire equity of this company may be sold.  Around
70% of the equity is Swiss controlled, through Jones group plc of
Dublin, with the remainder held by Irish interests.

Some of this equity may be taken up by Irish state peat board, Bord na
Mona, already selling peat and coal to households, and keen to expand
into other energy products.

Blugas has around 15% of the local bottled gas market, a fiercely
competitive market dominated by Calor and Flogas.

Calor and Flogas combined last year with Temp Technology of Dublin for
an assault on the local LPG-CHP market, but Blugas was excluded.

bills and better heating following the installation of a new, high
efficiency combined heat and power (CHP) system at the City's Barton
Hill estate.

The project, according to the CHP Association, was supported by a grant
of #75,000 from the Association's Residential CHP Programme.

The new CHP system generates heating for the 715 homes on the estate,
and power to offset the City Council's electricity costs.

CHPA said that tenants across the city will benefit from the energy
cost savings which CHP's inherently high efficiency delivers to the
council - a proportion of the savings will be invested in further
initiatives by the City's Energy Efficiency Unit. Meanwhile electricity
bills for the City's Council House will be reduced by an estimated
#43,000 a year.

The new system, opened on 7 December by CHPA vice president Peter Rost,
is the latest in a series to be supported under the #2 million
Residential CHP Programme, created and managed by the CHPA for the
Energy Saving Trust.

CAMPAIGN TO WIN SUPPORT FOR DISPOSAL OF OFFSHORE INSTALLATIONS

The oil and gas industry has launched a campaign to win over public
support for a wide range of disposable strategies for its redundant
offshore  installations.

The industry has refused to rule out deep sea dumping as an option for
the future, despite the Greenpeace Campaign which forced Shell to
abandon its plans to dump the Brent Spar facility. However, players
have acknowledged the need to be more transparent and open when
considering options.

"Events of the past few months have persuaded the industry that we need
to do more to understand better public concerns and to encourage
positive participation on the issue," said Dr Harold Hughes, director
general of the UK Offshore Operations Association (UKOOA).

With over 300 oil and gas installations due for decommissioning in the
North Sea and North Atlantic, Hughes estimated about 50 installations
could be decommissioned in the next decade at a cost of #1.5 billion.
As much as half of that cost would be met by the taxpayer.

UKOOA has suggested at least 75% of the installations will be disposed
of on land.

The European Commission will be reviewing the "economic and
environmental aspects" of the dumping of platforms in its review this
year.

However, no decision has been made in Brussels on whether to ban deep
sea dumping.

WYBREW LEADING CONTENDER FOR APPOINTMENT TO BRITISH GAS

We understand John Wybrew is the leading contender for appointment to
the main board of British Gas as director of communications strategy
and planning.

The appointment is seen as an attempt by BG to improve its public image
following a disastrous year in terms of public relations, including
chief executive Cedric Brown's salary increase.

Wybrew is currently on the board of Shell UK as corporate affairs
director.

It appears Peter Sanguinetti, the current head of corporate
communications, will remain with the company.

NEW SENSOR FOR DETECTION OF FLAMMABLE HYDROCARBONS

AMG Systems has developed a new sensor for the detection and
measurement of flammable hydrocarbons.

AMG says the sensor is intrinsically safe as it uses a patented
infrared light emitting diode (LED), in place of the usual heated
filament bulbs which themselves present an explosion hazard.

The research programme received a support award from the Department of
Trade and Industry and has attracted interest and support in the US.

BORD GAIS OFFERING GRANT TO SWITCH TO NATURAL GAS

Irish state gas distributor, Bord Gais, is offering households a grant
of Ir.#800 to switch heating systems to natural gas.

This scheme is believed to be annoying the local LPG, electricity and
coal industries,

who see it as an abuse of the state company's monopoly position.

There is also independent criticism from builders, who claim they
notice in the course of renovation of homes that owners wastefully
leave on their central heating, even in summer.

It is claimed householders are trying to use sufficient units to reach
targets set by Board Gais that bring qualification for company bonus
schemes.

Other critics suggest Ireland is giving little thought to likely gas
prices in the decades to come, assuming a never ending era of low gas
prices.

HOUSEHOLD BILLS COULD RISE BY ONE THIRD

Charity Age Concern has estimated that the average household bill could
rise by almost one third this winter because of the bitterly cold
weather and the addition of 8% VAT to domestic gas bills.

The government has a system of cold weather payments for households
which are payable when the temperature falls to freezing for seven
consecutive days.

However, only certain people are eligible for the #8.50 allowance.

To qualify for the payment, recipients must be claiming income support
and either 60 or over and claiming the basic state pension, disabled or
living with a disabled person, or with a dependent child under five.
