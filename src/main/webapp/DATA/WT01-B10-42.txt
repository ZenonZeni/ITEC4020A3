<h1 align=center>Is there really a pergonal Shortage? </h1>
<h3 align=center>or </h3>
<h2 align=center>Almost Free Pergonal</h2><hr>

<i>It's difficult enough going through ovulation induction cycles.  The time, money, and sore buttocks.  You would think that at the exorbitant prices being charged in the U.S., these drugs would be available without any problem.  Karen shares information about purchasing Pergonal from a foreign country.  Humegon and Metrodin may also be available at similar savings.  One of my patients recently traveled to Paris and saved enough on Pergonal purchases to pay airfare for she and her husband.  And they say taking a vacation doesn't help you get pregnant!<p></i>

Yes, <b>Pergonal</b> is <b><i>difficult to get</i></b> in this country and <b><i>over-priced</i></b>. Because of 
the difficulty in obtaining it, you are <i>legally allowed</i> to search for it in 
other countries. My clinic encourages obtaining Pergonal in Mexico where a 
perscription is not necessary. I live near Tijuana and can send you addresses of
pharmacies there. There are whole blocks of streets in Tijuana that have 
pharmacies selling Pergonal. I bought it for $13.00 per 75 iu amp. It was stored
in a refrigerator and all the expiration dates were good. It is also possible to
mail order from Mexico. That address often appears on alt.infertility.<p>

I have recently bought Pergonal from France and was also pleased with the 
pharmacy I used. <p><b>British and American Pharmacy<br></b> (phone) 47 42 49 40, fax 42 65 29
42<br>  1, rue Auber Place de l'Opra<br> 75009 Paris.<p> Fax your prescription 
and credit card number first, then follow up with a phone call to Rachel who speaks 
English. I paid $10.60 am amp and about a $60 mail and insurance fee. The 
package arrived within 2 days.<p>

If you need more info, feel free to contact me.<p>

       I highly doubt that the British and American Pharmacy here in Paris 
could be selling generic Pergonal and Metrodin, but I'd be interested in seeing 
the Email you received about it.  If there is anything to this accusation, I 
would want to alert the French authorities.<p>

       Legislation is extremely strict concerning medication in France.  It is 
also very beneficial to the big pharmaceutical companies -- all drugs are sold 
directly in their pharmaceutical company packaging (the pharmacist does not get 
to chose or mix anything), and generic drugs are basically non-existant here 
(the doctor has to specify the brand-name of the medicine he prescribes, and 
the pharmacist is not allowed to substitute an equivalent).<p>

       Furthermore, Sereno Labs (makers of Pergonal and Metrodin) has a big and 
active presence here in France (they are a family-owned Italian company, for 
those of you who didn't know it).  They constitute a very strong lobby with 
pharmacists, doctors and politicians. <p>

       By the way, prices of these drugs are lower in France simply because the 
government sets the final price (fixing wholesale drug prices and retail drug 
prices), and therfore decides on the margin which the drug companies, the 
middlemen and the pharmacist will make on a given item.  Pharmacies are only 
free to set over-the-counter prices (and the products which fall into this 
category are much more limited than in the US).   <p>

       Finally, you should note that Pergonal is called "Neopergonal" here, and 
that Metrodin is spelled "Metrodine".  Maybe this difference is what made 
someone think it was a "fake".  Also, and most importantly, the Metrodin 
currently available in the US is no longer on the market here.  It has been 
replaced by "Metrodine HP", where HP stands for highly purified.  This new drug 
is bio-equivalent to the old Metrodine, but has been better purified to remove 
unwanted proteins.  It is currently in the process of getting its FDA approval, 
and should be on the US market before the end of the year (or so a Sereno rep 
told me this summer).<p>
