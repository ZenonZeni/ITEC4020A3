<H2>Careers in Chemistry</H2><P>

All the visible world is made of chemicals, and many industries, 
human activities and natural processes are based on chemistry.  
Chemistry is the study of elements and compounds, their laws of 
combination and their behaviour under various conditions.  
Changing one substance into another, as well as making substances 
of desired properties, is the work of the chemist:  nylon from 
coal and petroleum, and nitrogenous fertilisers from air are 
but two examples.
<P>
There are five major divisions of chemistry:  physical, inorganic, 
organic, analytical and environemntal. The last two in many places, 
including the NTU, are often taught together.
<P>
Analytical Chemistry is the scientific discipline which develops 
and applies methods, instuments and strategies to obtain information 
on the composition and nature of matter in space and time.
<P>
Environemntal chemistry applies aspects of all the other four 
divisions of chemistry in studying environmental processes.
<P>
Inorganic chemistry is the study of the synthesis, structure, 
and properties of substances formed by metal and non-metallic 
elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus and chlorine.  
Industrial inorganic compounds include fertilisers, ores, 
acids, alkalides and salts.
<P>
Organic chemistry is concerned with carbon compounds.  
The designation "organic" comes from earlier days when all 
such substances known came from organisms.  Nowadays many 
compounds are produced in the laboratory, and often also in 
the factory:  for example plastics and synthetic fibres, 
medicinal drugs, insecticides, fungicides and dyes.
<P>
Physical chemists use physical and mathematical methods to 
study the laws that govern the nature and the rates of 
chemical reactions and the energy available from them, the 
forces that bind atoms together, and the effects of electricity 
and radiation on chemical substances.

In every field of chemistry the varied nature of the work challenges young chemists to thought and experiment.  The solution of chemical problems gives them a sense of achievement, and the need to find solutions stimulates their intellectual development.
<P>
Although a graduate chemist in his/her first job may have to 
become familiar with routine procedures, these are now mostly 
done with the aid of commercially made instruments such as 
spectrometers and chromatographs, operated with the assistance 
of junior staff.  Commonly used instruments often cost $10,000 
and some cost more than $100,000.  The chemist must assess 
the results obtained from them.  The bunsen burner and test 
tube may still be used, but they are no longer the appropriate 
symbols of modern chemistry.  The sophisticated instruments 
now available lead to higher levels of understanding and of 
process control than were possible formerly, and this in turn 
places new demands on the chemists in charge of the operation 
or experiment.  Consequently chemists aspiring to leading 
positions should be highly trained.
<P>
Fully professional chemists are members of the Royal Australian 
Chemical Institute and are entitled to call themselves 
"Chartered Chemists" and put the letters "C.Chem." after 
their name.  To achieve this level, you must have a university 
degree in Chemistry plus 4 years experience.  The NTU B.Sc 
degree with a major in Chemistry allows you to become a graduate 
member of RACI and go on to obtain the 4 years of experience. 
<P>
Chemists are employed in a number of capacities:-
<OL>
<LI>	Teaching chemistry in secondary schools, in colleges 
of advanced education, in technical colleges, in institutes 
of technology and in universities.

<LI>	Industry.  In Australia more than 600 companies 
employ chemists.  Many are engaged in research problems, 
devising new or better processes for compounds or seeking 
an explanation of observed phenomena. Others are concerned 
with the application to industry of the discoveries made 
by research chemists.  Others again are engaged in technical 
sales and advisory service work.  Not only are chemists employed 
by chemical firms, mining firms, firms manufacturing steel and 
other metals, motor vehicles and heavy machinery, but 
increasingly the process industries are involved, eg those 
which manufacture ceramics, detergents and soaps, adhesives, 
foodstuffs of all kinds, wines and spirits, petroleum, paint, 
paper and other forest products, plastics, rubber, tanning 
and textiles, and pharmaceutical. Some chemists in industry 
leave the laboratory after some years to become administrators 
within the company.

<LI>	Government and university research.  In the Australian 
Public Service departments of Supply, Defence, Health, Science, 
Minerals and Energy, and Northern Development, chemists work 
in fields such as mineral chemistry, chemistry of natural 
products, fuels, nutrition and biochemistry.  They are to be 
found also in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, and in the 
CSIRO Chemical Research Laboratories and the Division of Animal 
Health, Food Processing Technology, Forest Products, Mineral 
Chemistry, Fisheries and Tribophysics, Soils, and Wool and 
Meat Research Laboratories.  Chemists work also in the 
Australian Atomic Energy Commission, Customs and Excise, 
in Telecom, in State departments of Primary Industry, 
Health, Mines and Railways, and in local authority departments 
of electricity supply, sewerage, roads, water, etc.
</OL>
<P>
The biggest employer of chemists in Australia is the 
Department of Supply.  About one-third of CSIRO's 4000 
scientists are chemists.  Northern Territory employers include 
the Department of Mines and Energy, Transport and Works, 
Health, Primary Industry and Fisheries, and analytical 
laboratories in the mining industries.
<P>
Chemists work also in oceanography, environmental pollution 
studies, cancer and other medical research, and in 
operations research.  The training in experiment and 
logical thought which chemistry students receive fits 
them also for diverse kinds of employment besides those 
which are specifically chemistry.  Education through 
chemistry gives a real appreciation of the scientific 
method, and an understanding of our technological society. 
Good chemistry graduates have a very marketable commodity - 
themselves. The wide-ranging nature of the subject compels 
its practitioners to operate from fundamental principles 
and to be adaptable and flexible, qualities which are today 
greatly in demand.
<P>
Degrees higher than B.Sc. are now required for teaching and 
research positions in tertiary education, for the better 
positions in research organisations, and for many of those 
in industry.  Good students should seriously consider taking 
a higher degree, and would be wise to explore carefully all 
developing employment possibilities so that they remain 
continuously aware of the areas and levels of employment 
entry available to them.
<P>
Chemistry is a vital science for a much wider range of 
degrees.  For this reason Chemistry is offered to nursing 
and engineering students, as well as the Science students.
<P>
Chemical industry and research laboratories also offer careers 
as Technical Officers.  The Analytical Chemistry stream of 
the Associate Diploma in Applied Science offers the appropriate 
training for these careers.  Students frequently study for the 
Associate Diploma part-time while working as a trainee technical 
officer in a laboratory.  Some Associate Diploma holders move 
on to study for a degree in Chemistry and may receive appropriate 
credit towards the degree for the course they have completed 
in the Associate diploma. The Associate Diploma in Applied 
Science also leads to professional recognition by the Royal 
Australian Chemical Institute. Qualified Chemistry Technical 
Officers can add the letters TRACI after their names.
<P>

Australian Chemical Institute</A> is available on the web
or from any of the Chemistry staff. Brian Salter-Duke is
the current President of the NT Branch of RACI.
