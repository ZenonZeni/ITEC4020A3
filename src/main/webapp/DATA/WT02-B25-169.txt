<B>i.</B>A provision was included in P.L. 104-120 to authorize funds for Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance specifically for people with disabilities.  As Opening Doors went to press, the future of this set-aside was in the hands of Congressional appropriators who were considering HUD's Fiscal Year 1997 budget.<P>

<B>ii.</B>  To arrive at a truly valid estimate of the number of  people with disabilities who may qualify as having worst case housing needs, people with disabilities who are not receiving  SSI benefits but have incomes below 50% of median must also be included.  Because this estimate is difficult to obtain without further study, the CCD estimates also represent an undercounting of the total number of people with disabilities who have worst case housing needs.<P>

<B>iii.</B>  It is very likely that a significant percentage of these 565,000 individuals have income from sources other than SSI, however, because it was impossible to determine the exact number of people with disabilities on SSI that are assisted by HUD the CCD Housing Task Force used the 565,000 figure in its calculations.<P>

<B>iv.</B>  "The CCD Housing Task Force takes issue with HUD's use of less reliable data from the SSI data extract to estimate the number of people with disabilities currently receiving HUD assistance.  Based on an audit of only 5,000 SSI recipients (which was never designed nor intended to be used as an accurate measure of federal housing assistance provided to people with disabilities) HUD erroneously concludes that "adults with disabilities are heavily served by housing assistance programs."  HUD's willingness to ignore its own primary data within the MTCS and TRACS systems, which document much lower utilization of federal housing assistance for people with disabilities, could be construed as an attempt to mitigate the negative impact of designated housing policies on people with disabilities and minimize the need to allocate replacement resources."<P>

<B>v.</B>   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Policy Development and Research reports that recent turnover rates in subsidized housing are in excess of 10%.<P>

<B>vi.</B>    Although public housing authorities have been able to designate housing as "elderly only" for several years, the Housing Opportunities Program Extension Act of 1996 has removed most of the protections provided for people with disabilities in earlier legislation. As a result, public housing agencies are expected to increase their "elderly only" designation activities.</fontsize>
