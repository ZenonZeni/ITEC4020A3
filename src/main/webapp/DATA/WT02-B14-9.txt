<a name="RTFToC3">House
Subcommittee Approves Immigration
Reform</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>On July 20, the House Judiciary's Immigration and Claims Subcommittee
approved by voice vote the Immigration in the National Interest Act of 1995, HR
1915, sponsored by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX), and co-sponsored by 59
representatives.  The measure will be considered by the full House Judiciary
Committee in September. </tt><p>
<tt>The measure deals with both legal and illegal immigration.  It would reduce
legal immigration by eliminating current slots reserved for the adult brothers
and sisters of US citizens.  </tt><p>
<tt>The bill seeks to reduce illegal immigration by doubling the number of INS
investigators, doubling the Border Patrol within the next five years, and
stiffening penalties for illegal use of counterfeit government documents.
Under the bill, states would be reimbursed for the costs of jailing illegal
immigrants, including those in county jails, and providing emergency health
care for illegal aliens.  The bill does not include a border crossing fee.
</tt><p>
<tt>The House Appropriations Committee attached an amendment to an omnibus
appropriations bill that would eliminate funding for inland immigration
checkpoints near San Clemente and Temecula and move the INS agents who
currently operate them to the border.  The change would be effective Oct. 1,
1995, when FY 1996 begins.  There are 35 active INS checkpoints in the
US.</tt><p>
<tt>The Border Patrol believes that the checkpoints are effective and asked for
full funding to keep them open all the time.  More than 150,000 aliens were
apprehended at the checkpoints during the past three years.  According to some
reports, 62 percent of all illegal entrants use smugglers to cross the
US-Mexican border, and then pay up to $300 in additional fees to be smuggled
past the active checkpoints.</tt><p>
<tt>At the end of June 1995, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-CA) presented a list of 100
proposals to House Speaker Newt Gingrich with the promise that, if they were
adopted, illegal immigration would be drastically reduced.  The 54-member House
Task Force recommended that children born to illegal aliens in the US no longer
become US citizens automatically, and that hospitals wishing to be reimbursed
by the federal government notify the INS before releasing suspected illegal
alien patients.</tt><p>
<tt>Critics of these proposals worry that it could lead to the creation of a
permanent underclass of sub-citizens--immigrants who live in the US, but are
denied public schooling and government benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>Gallegly's task force also recommended that illegal aliens apprehended in
the US be fined $250 the first time caught, forfeit their assets the second
time, and face time in jail for a third apprehension.  The INS currently
fingerprints and photographs the 2,000 illegal aliens apprehended every day in
San Diego and, with an estimated 20 percent or 400 repeater offenders,
implementing this proposal would soon require far more than the 500-bed
detention facility currently available.  Gallegly recommended the use of closed
military bases to hold aliens.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">New
Asylum</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
Rules</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The INS on January 4, 1995 implemented new regulations to reduce "abuse" of
the asylum system.  On July 5, 1995, the INS reported that these new
regulations have been successful in deciding quickly whether an alien needs
protection in the US. </tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton administration planned to adjudicate 150,000 asylum
applications by September 1995.  In the first eight months of FY95, the INS
completed more than 61,000 cases, compared to the 35,000 cases it adjudicated
during the same period last year.  There is a backlog of over 400,000 requests
for asylum awaiting INS decisions.</tt><p>
<tt>Aliens seeking asylum enter the US, and then file a form in person or by
mail that asserts that the individual seeking to stay in the US would face
persecution in his or her country of citizenship.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of asylum seekers has climbed, and reached almost 150,000 in
FY94.  About one-fourth of all these asylum seekers are Guatemalans, one-eighth
are Salvadorans, and one-twelfth are Chinese.  Another 20,000 asylum claims
were filed by aliens who were in the process of being excluded from or deported
from the US.  About 20 percent of the aliens who ask for asylum are granted
permission to remain in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>The reforms announced in January 1995 have resulted in decisions on most
new cases filed within 10 to 14 days after applicants are interviewed by asylum
officers.  Asylum applicants are not eligible to work legally in the US until
at least 180 days after their application has been filed, or when it is
approved, whichever comes first.  One year after being granted asylum, aliens
are entitled to immigrant status.</tt><p>
<tt>To deter fraudulent claims for asylum, the INS is increasing detention and
speeding up the deportation of those denied asylum.  Asylum officers report
that, in many instances, individuals use the same words they have been coached
to repeat to describe their persecution.  These measures have decreased asylum
claims by 14 percent from January to May. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS has the authority to detain persons seeking asylum who do not have
any immigration documents.  Under legislation pending in Congress, applicants
for asylum who arrive in the US without documents and request asylum would be
excluded from the US while their claims are processed.  Aliens in the US would
have to request asylum within 30 days of arriving in the US--today, some aliens
wait until they are apprehended to apply for asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, about 38,000 Cubans and 26,000 Haitians attempted to come to the
US in boats to apply for asylum.  To prevent their entry and process asylum
applications, the US established a safe haven for them in Guantanamo. </tt><p>
<tt>One hundred and eight Chinese refugees from the Golden Venture, which ran
aground near New York harbor in June 1993, are being held in York, Pennsylvania
while the INS determines whether they will be granted political asylum.  Only
five of the York detainees have been granted asylum, 26 have returned to China.
Some York residents hold a vigil for one hour every Sunday to demonstrate their
solidarity with the Chinese refugees. </tt><p>
<tt>On July 19, four of the Golden Venture refugees, testified before the House
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights.  The women said that
they were forced to undergo abortions or sterilizations under unsanitary
conditions.  All four have been denied political asylum in the US.</tt><p>
<tt>Legislation that grant asylum to persons forced to undergo abortion or
sterilization was passed by the House and is pending in the Senate.  President
Clinton has threatened to veto the measure. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS detains over 80,000 asylum seekers annually, often in private
facilities operated by for-profit companies.  On June 18, some 300 asylum
seekers being held in a privately-operated detention center in Elizabeth, New
Jersey rioted, alleging that they were being mistreated.  On July 21, the INS
agreed with the asylum seekers, and canceled the company's five-year, $51
million contract to operate the facility.  The INS found that the facility was
run by poorly trained and abusive guards, who were left unsupervised by their
superiors. </tt><p>
<tt>An attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union said that similar abuses
can be found at other detention facilities around the country.  INS Commission
Meissner believes that the problems at the New Jersey facility were an isolated
incidence and plans to continue to use private detention centers.  Esmor
continues to detain aliens for the INS in the Seattle area.</tt><p>
<tt>In Florida, several nurseries have complained that if their Salvadoran
workers, some of whose work permits expire in September, 1995, leave, they will
face labor shortages.  Some have worked for 10 or more years for one
employer.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is stepping up its efforts to deport criminal aliens, persons who
committed crimes in the US as illegal aliens (or became illegal aliens because
of the crime) served their sentences, and are now being deported.  In 1986,
2,000 criminal aliens were deported; in 1995, 22,000, and in 1996, the INS
plans to deport 58,000.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Hearing
on Prop.
187</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>During a July 26, 1995 hearing, opponents of Prop. 187 told a federal judge
in Los Angeles that the measure was unconstitutional, and that she should
simply declare Prop. 187 unconstitutional without a trial.  Opponents argued
that the measure unconstitutionally interfered with the federal government's
jurisdiction over immigration policy.  </tt><p>
<tt>Opponents argued that only the federal government, and not the state
government, can take steps designed to reduce illegal immigration.  According
to one anti-187 attorney, "California has no business, no business at all,
saying who may come in and who may go out."</tt><p>
<tt>The state of California countered that the purpose of Prop. 187 was to
decide how scarce state resources should be allocated among persons who apply
for benefits under state-run programs.  The state offered the judge a draft
letter that would be given to suspected illegal aliens that advises them to
either leave the US, or contact the INS to resolve their legal status.  </tt><p>
<tt>The judge has several options, including declaring part or all of Prop. 187
unconstitutional, and scheduling a trial on the entire initiative or the
sections deemed constitutional.  That trial is currently scheduled for
September.  </tt><p>
<tt>If the judge declares Prop. 187 unconstitutional, state lawyers say they
will file an appeal with the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.  The group that
sponsored Prop. 187 has threatened to offer a $10,000 reward to anyone who can
prove that the judge personally hired an illegal alien; Prop. 187 proponents
believe that the judge personally opposes Prop. 187.</tt><p>
<tt>Legal observers predict the case will reach the US Supreme Court in 1996 or
1997. </tt><p>
<tt>Several hundred college and law students are participating in a California
Freedom Summer campaign to take testimony from immigrants that Prop. 187 has
led to or increased discrimination against them.  The first Freedom Summer was
in 1964, when college students flooded Mississippi to register Black
voters.</tt><p>

the LA Garment
Industry</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>/a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>In June, Los Angeles area garment manufacturers signed an agreement with
the US Labor Department to begin policing labor practices.  Under the
Compliance Alliance, private police hired by manufacturers are to assist
government labor investigators by auditing contractors and identifying shops
that break laws on minimum wage, overtime pay and child labor.</tt><p>
<tt>Over the past five years, garment making in Los Angeles has become an $8
billion annual industry.  Over 150,000 workers are employed by manufacturers
and contractors in Los Angeles. </tt><p>
<tt>Under the three-year old Target Industries Partnership Program (TIP), state
and federal authorities combined forces to conduct monthly sweeps to enforce
labor laws in the garment and agriculture industries.  </tt><p>
<tt>During one two-hour sting operation, violations for illegal cash payments
and unpaid overtime resulted in $20,000 in fines.  Over 90 percent of the 4,000
garment contractors in Los Angles have 50 or fewer employees, and many are
non-English speaking.  Some employers close up shop after being fined, and then
re-open under a new name at a different location. </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, investigators conducted about 500 garment industry audits
statewide -- most of them in Los Angeles -- assessing $4.5 million in penalties
and collecting $2.6 million in unpaid wages.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Reaction
to CIR Proposals</a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Strange bedfellows attacked the Commission on Immigration Reform's
proposals to reduce and restructure legal immigration.  The Wall Street Journal
on July 3 attacked what it called "bipartisan animosity" toward legal
immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>Most of the attacks on the CIR recommendations were directed at the
recommendation to reduce the number of immigrants admitted for economic and
employment, and to require US employers who bring immigrants to the US to pay
more than the prevailing wage, plus a fee into a training fund to prepare US
workers for these jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt>The number of professionals and skilled workers seeking one of the 150,000
visas reserved for such workers and their families--the quota was higher in
1994 because of unused slots from earlier years-- fell from 147,000 in 1993 to
123,300 in 1994, largely because such immigrants did not apply for
visas.</tt><p>
<tt>The Wall Street Journal editorial argued that adopting the CIR's
recommendation to reduce the number of immigrants admitted for economic or
employment reasons from 140,000 to 100,000 annually would be costly to US
high-tech firms.  Microsoft, the software firm, reports that three to four
percent of its 12,000 US-based employees are foreign born. </tt><p>
<tt>USA Today analyzed data on 2.2 million immigrants who arrived between 1991
and 1993, and concluded that if the US changes its immigration system to give
more weight to personal characteristics that produce high US earnings, then the
sources of US immigrants would change.  For example, 52 percent of the 1993
immigrants from Mexico reporting an occupation listed laborer, while 0.3
percent were engineers.  By contrast, one percent of Indian immigrants were
laborers, and 25 percent were engineers.</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, 40 percent of all legal immigrants came from five countries:
Mexico, China, the Philippines, Vietnam and the Dominican Republic. Most head
for New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and Houston.</tt><p>
<tt>According to a USA Today/Gallup poll, 65 percent of all respondents, and 30
percent of immigrant respondents, think that immigration should be reduced;
seven percent of all respondents, and 15 percent of immigrant respondents,
think that immigration should be increased.  Almost 60 percent of immigrants
and other respondents think that immigrants should "blend in" to American
culture, versus about one-third who think that immigrants should do more to
maintain their own culture.</tt><p>
<tt>Asian immigrant groups attacked proposals by the CIR that were endorsed by
President Clinton to eliminate the quotas for adult relatives of US citizens to
enter the US as immigrants.  According to their data, 40 percent of all adult
children of US citizens, and two-thirds of all adult brothers and sisters of US
citizens, are Asians.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC8">INS
to Open Shelter for Undocumented
Children</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The INS in August will begin to house unaccompanied and minor illegal
aliens in Tucson, Arizona, and later in El Paso, Texas.  In Tucson, refugee
advocates reportedly cared for 470 undocumented minors in 1994, up from 188 in
1993.  Most Mexican children are sent home immediately, but children from more
distant countries, such as Nicaragua, often remain in the US while their case
is being decided.  The INS prefers to release children to their families or
foster parents rather than detain them.</tt><p>
<tt>The children, all under 18, will be housed from several nights to several
months while the INS decides their case.  The average stay is expected to be 21
days.  Currently, if family or foster care cannot be found for unaccompanied
minors, they are sent to shelters in California or Texas.  The shelter will
have 32 to 48 beds, which leads critics to complain that it is too large and
may mean the children are detained longer than necessary. </tt><p>
<tt>The INS opened the shelter because of recent court rulings that require
illegal immigrant children to be housed apart from unrelated adults or criminal
juveniles.  The shelter will be run by Southwest Key, a private, non-profit
organization that runs about 25 treatment programs for juvenile delinquents in
Texas, Arizona and Puerto Rico.  This concerns some who say the organization
deals with delinquents, not children without criminal histories.  Southwest Key
will be paid by the federal government about $80 per child per day. </tt><p>
<tt>Church groups criticized the plan.  They argue that by holding the
children, the government is using the children as "bait" to catch their illegal
immigrant parents who are already living in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>The INS announced it will replace current border-crossing cards with a
tamper proof one with finger or handprints.  The change, the first in 40 years,
is scheduled to begin on Oct. 1.  </tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, the INS received 225,000 applications for border-crossing cards,
most from those along the Texas border.  To qualify, applicants must prove in
an interview that they live and work in the border region.  Temporary cards are
issued the same day. </tt><p>

<tt>Despite strong statements against agricultural guest workers in June 1995
by both President Clinton and the Jordan Commission on Immigration Reform,
California farm organizations continued their quest to include a guest worker
program in immigration reform legislation moving through Congress.  As in the
mid-1980s, the growers argue that, despite employer sanctions and high
unemployment rates among US farm workers, at least 30 to 50 percent of their
seasonal workers are unauthorized.</tt><p>
<tt>If immigration reforms successfully reduce unauthorized immigration and
employment, growers argue, there would be farm labor shortages that could not
be dealt with through the current H-2A program that admits temporary foreign
workers to fill vacant US farm jobs.  </tt><p>
<tt>Critics argue that there would be no shortage of farm workers if growers
raised wages and improved working conditions.  Many advocates assert that the
H-2A program includes work guarantees and housing requirements to avoid
exploitation.  Growers say the rules make the H-2A program too bureaucratic and
expensive.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 11, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich held a press conference near
Fresno, California to announce that so far in FY95, DOL had assessed growers
and contractors about $2.1 million for underpayment of 2,700 farm workers.  In
a few cases, growers responded to fines by announcing publicly that they were
taking corrective actions, but most growers responded that they do comply with
federal and state laws.  </tt><p>
<tt>An important issue is whether the creation of an alternative to the H-2A
program would increase or decrease illegal immigration.  The Bracero program
that gave between one and two million Mexican workers experience in the US farm
labor market, and is widely believed to have laid the ground work for
subsequent illegal immigration.</tt><p>
<tt>Washington State fruit growers are asking Congress for permission to import
guest workers for the first time in 40 years.  The Washington State Apple
Commission said as many as 50,000 temporary workers are required to harvest the
state's $ 1 billion-a-year apple crop.  Some estimate that 30 percent of
Washington's farm workers are illegal. </tt><p>
<tt>At a presidential summit in Portland in late June, Harry Kubo of Fresno
urged Clinton to endorse agriculture's need for "guest workers."</tt><p>
<tt>A University of California study found that the number of workers employed
by farm labor contractors in California has risen steadily since the late
1980s.  In interviews, the growers said that a major reason why they turn to
farm labor contractors is increasing regulation of the farm labor market--using
contractors allows growers to turn the cost and liability of immigration and
labor law violations over to a third party, and competition between contractors
to supply workers to growers has kept the cost of using a third party about the
same as directly hiring workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Only one of the eleven growers interviewed said a labor shortage was the
reason a labor contractor was used. </tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC10">Economics,
Education, and Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Economist George Borjas estimated that the net benefits of current
immigration are about $7 billion annually, or equivalent to half of Microsoft
CEO Bill Gates' net worth, or as much as Americans spend gambling each week.
According to Borjas, immigration generates $140 billion per year in benefits to
the US, mostly from higher land and capital prices, and imposes $133 billion
per year in costs, primarily in lower wages and unemployment among US
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The nation's 27 million Hispanics in 1994 are 10 percent of the US
population.  A Census report released in July reported that, in 1994, only nine
percent of Hispanics 25 and older had BA degrees or more, versus 24 percent of
non-Hispanics.  This 2.7 ratio of non-Hispanic to Hispanic college graduates
widened since 1970, when there were 2.3 non-Hispanic BA degree holders for
every Hispanic degree holder.  About 13 percent of adult Blacks had college
degrees in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Years of education is the best single predictor of income in the US.  In
mid-1995, the median weekly earnings of full-time workers 25 and older without
a high school diploma was $309, versus $428 for high-school graduates, and $593
for high-school graduates with some college.  The 30 percent of the adult work
force with college degrees earned a median $750 per week.</tt><p>
<tt>Real wages have been falling, and many workers reportedly feel poorer
because the gap between wages and salaries and total compensation has widened
as more of their compensation comes in the form of fringe benefits.  This means
that workers who get few fringe benefits have seen both their real hourly wages
decline and, since they get few fringe benefits, their total compensation
decline.</tt><p>
<tt>Low earnings translate into relatively paltry savings for retirement.
According to a recent survey, a typical white household with members aged 51 to
60 had less than $18,000 in personal wealth (plus $70,000 in home equity),
while Black and Hispanic households in this age range had less than $500 in
non-real estate wealth.  Claims to social security and private pensions
accounted for over half of the typical 51 to 60 household's wealth.</tt><p>
<tt>Some mainstream US universities are very dependent on foreign students.  In
1994, for example, Boston University and the University of Southern California
had the most foreign students in 1994, 4,700 and 4,300, respectively, and
University of Wisconsin-Madison and University of Texas-Austin followed with
4,000 each.  Most foreign students from countries such as Japan and Hong Kong
pay full tuition, encouraging US universities to "market" themselves
abroad.</tt><p>
<tt>US schools that cater to resident immigrants have been accused of
fraudulently enrolling needy immigrants in order to collect grant funds from
them.  For example, the Iade American Schools in Los Angeles was accused of
collecting $58 million in Pell grants to needy students to enroll Hispanic
immigrants in classes such as auto mechanic and English as a Second
Language.</tt><p>
<tt>A Stanford-Rand study concluded that there are too many PhDs produced in
the US, and that graduate schools continue to admit students to satisfy their
need for teaching and research assistants, not because there are jobs waiting
for graduates.  Unemployment among persons with PhDs is low but, it is
asserted, the reason for low unemployment is because many persons with PhDs are
underemployed or employed in jobs that do not use the research skills they
acquired.</tt><p>
<tt>The Stanford-Rand study concluded that there are, in fields such as
computer science, 50 percent too many PhDs being produced, 44 percent too many
mechanical engineering PhDs, and 30 percent too many physics, chemistry, and
mathematics PhDs.  The report concluded that increased federal funding for
science and engineering will only aggravate the situation by delaying the
needed shrinking of PhD programs.</tt><p>
<tt>There are estimates that 25 to 40 percent of the scientists and engineers
who work in some US research labs are foreign born.  This may be true, but most
of the nation's two million scientists and engineers-- in a US labor force of
120 million--are US-born.</tt><p>
<tt>In a related development, the US Department of Labor in mid-June began to
include private companies in the calculation of prevailing wages that
universities must pay to post-doctorate foreign researchers, significantly
raising their wages.  Research labs and medical schools have been forced to
raise wages by 30 to 60 percent, so that they pay at least 95 percent of the
prevailing wage.</tt><p>
<tt>In some cases, foreigners working on research grants must be paid,
according to revised DOL prevailing wage standards, more than the government
agency making the research grant permits.  If the foreign lab workers are
switched from F to H-1B visas, then there is no prevailing wage
requirement.</tt><p>
<tt>The Labor Department says the change in policy should eliminate financial
incentives to hire foreign workers over Americans.  But educators say it will
result in pricing universities out of important research because there are not
enough Americans doing similar research.</tt><p>
<tt>Several newspapers investigated the H-1B program that admits up to 65,000
temporary foreign workers annually and reported that US employers abuse the
"attestation process" that permits them to certify that they looked for but
failed to find US workers at prevailing wages and conditions.  According to one
lawyer, the trick is to describe "the relevant job opening tightly enough that
the INS recognizes an American probably isn't readily available for the
position, but not so tightly that the INS suspects the description is being
tailored for a specific foreign individual."</tt><p>
<tt>Employers usually have a foreign worker in mind when they request that the
US Department of Labor certify their need for foreign workers.  In 1995, only
once in every 200 times did the employer who requested foreign workers hire a
US worker who was referred to the vacant job for which the foreign was sought.
DOL reportedly spends $50 million annually on labor certification
activities.</tt><p>
<tt>The firm that maintains the White House correspondence system, Mastech,
reportedly imported about 1,000 of its 1,200 workers from India under the H-1B
program, and is currently being investigated.  Two companies that have been
heavy users of the program that permits US employers to bring permanent
immigrants to the US to fill vacant jobs are Showell Farms and ConAgra Poultry.
Showell Farms has reportedly brought "hundreds" of Koreans to the US to be
poultry workers for $5 per hour.</tt><p>
<tt>Between 1988 and 1994, employers used the Permanent Alien Certification
program to bring to the US 793 auto body repairers, 650 carpenters, 186 pizza
bakers, 104 car wash attendants, 82 doughnut makers, 51 barbers, 48 insurance
salesmen, 35 salad makers, 33 manicurists, 28 chauffeurs, 26 tire repairers, 15
social secretaries, and 12 garbage truck drivers.</tt><p>
<tt>A New York church asked DOL for permission to bring an immigrant to the US
to be a missionary on the streets of New York, claiming that Americans "lacked
enthusiasm and determination" for such work.  DOL refused to certify the
church's need for the alien.</tt><p>
<tt>One California investigator estimates that 40 percent of employer
applications for immigrants to fill vacant jobs are fraudulent, in most cases,
the alien is already working, and the employer simply wants to legalize his or
her status.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC11">Mexico
Stabilizes and
Reforms</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Mexican stock market is up 50 percent since its February 27, 1995 low
of 1448, but there are fears that political scandals and violence will slow the
recovery from the current recession.</tt><p>
<tt>The government now projects that Mexican GDP will shrink two percent in
1995, and grow by three percent in 1996.  But domestic consumption has fallen
drastically in the wake of two million layoffs since December 1995, and
increased exports have not been able to absorb many unemployed workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The US House Representatives on July 19 voted to prohibit the US Treasury
from lending more money to Mexico.  In January 1995, the US promised Mexico up
to $20 billion in funds to support the peso; about $12.5 billion has been sent
to Mexico so far.</tt><p>
<tt>In a review of what went wrong in Mexico in December 1994, much of the
blame was laid on ex-Finance minister Pedro Aspe, who successfully resisted a
Salinas-Zedillo agreement to devalue the peso on November 20, 1994, shortly
before Salinas left office.  Aspe was afraid that a devaluation would halt the
influx of foreign investment in Mexico.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexican officials argued that the country could continue to run a trade
deficit financed by foreign investors because Mexico was importing capital
goods that would accelerate its growth rate.  But less than one-fourth of
Mexico's imports in 1994 were capital goods.</tt><p>
<tt>Some US investors reinforced Mexico's decision not to devalue, and
encouraged Mexico to issue so-called tesobonos, government debt that was repaid
in pesos at a pre-announced exchange rate.  If Mexico devalued, these tesobonos
would increase the country's foreign debt in dollar terms.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico in 1995 has been running a trade surplus with the US, largely
because the peso devaluation made exports cheaper and imports more expensive.
</tt><p>
<tt>A profile of a tobacco firm in Nayarit, about 400 miles northwest of Mexico
City, demonstrated the positive role that large companies can play in reforming
Mexico's agricultural sector.  Mexico has about six million farmers scattered
across 400 million acres of arable land, but they generate only about eight
percent of Mexico's $350 million GDP. [The US has about two million farmers and
one billion acres of farm land, although crops are harvested from only 300
million acres].</tt><p>
<tt>About 20 percent of Mexico's farm land is held in small farms of less than
10 acres each.  The tobacco company coordinates farmers willing to work
together in 150 to 200 acre blocks.  The farmers then farm as instructed, with
equipment, seeds, and loans provided by the tobacco company.  Profits are split
50-50--four acres of low-grade tobacco returns about $4,000 annually for the
farm family's labor.  The tobacco company, La Moderna, also exported $130
million worth of fresh produce to the US in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The Solidarity program, which spent $15 billion in federal funds between
1988 and 1994 to help Mexican communities build infrastructure, is yet another
Salinas-era program under attack in Mexico.  Salinas hoped to be remembered for
NAFTA and Solidarity, but critics now charge that Solidarity was simply a
program to keep poor Mexicans voting PRI while the country restricted its
economy.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition to charges that some communities built projects such as
baseball stadiums, it has been alleged that the temporary jobs created by
Solidarity do little to help Mexico's 15 million very poor people.  One
analysis found that Solidarity funds were targeted in swing districts, and that
every one percent increase in PRI votes in 1991 midterm elections was rewarded
with an additional $2.50 per voter spent on Solidarity projects.</tt><p>
<tt>The government argues that Solidarity funds are spent in all 31 Mexican
states, including the four governed by the opposition.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico built 6,000 kilometers of new roads during Salinas' six-year term
between 1988-1994, with $14 billion in private foreign investment.  The
government is being forced to bail out several of these projects, largely
because private construction companies far overestimated usage and revenues
from high tolls when obtaining loans from state-owned banks.  </tt><p>
<tt>The government often awarded road concessions to the bidder that offered
the shortest time period of private ownership, usually 14 years until the
project was to be turned over to the government.  Road concessions are being
lengthened up to 30 years.  Roads are a high priority in Mexico because 80
percent of Mexican exports move by land.</tt><p>
<tt>Maquiladoras are foreign-owned factories in Mexico that import components
and assemble electronics, auto parts, and other products to export, usually
back to the US.  After the 1982 peso devaluation, the number of maquiladoras
mushroomed, so that, in the early 1990s, some 2,000 factories employed about
500,000 Mexican workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Maquiladoras were expected to shrink as NAFTA eliminated tariffs, but they
have not.  Recent projections are that almost 400 maquiladoras will be added by
the year 2000, raising the Mexican work force employed in foreign-owned
factories from 579,000 in 1994 to 943,000 in 2000.  Wages and benefits in the
maquiladoras averaged about $1.80 per hour in mid-1995, and are projected to
remain below $2.50 per hour until the year 2000.</tt><p>
<tt>Ciudad Juarez, which lies across the US-Mexican border from El Paso, added
about 40,000 jobs in the last year.  Juarez expects to add another 30,000 jobs
this year despite the peso devaluation and economic crisis.  NAFTA is credited
with creating these jobs, most of which are in Juarez's 300 maquiladoras.
</tt><p>
<tt>El Paso is the fourth-largest city in Texas, and the third-fastest growing
metropolitan area in the US.  Juarez is Mexico's fourth-largest urban center.
El Paso grows through middle-class suburban developments, while Juarez adds
shantytowns west of the city's garbage dump.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite maquiladora jobs, many Mexicans still try to find work in El Paso.
But Operation Hold the Line seems to be making it more difficult to commute
regularly as an illegal alien to a job in El Paso.  The INS plans to build a
ten foot high wall along about 1.3 miles of border in a New Mexico suburb of El
Paso to discourage aliens from going around Operation Hold the Line
agents.</tt><p>
<tt>Some downtown merchants have lost as much as 50 percent of their business
since Hold the Line, although the peso devaluation and NAFTA also undoubtedly
contributed to declining sales.  Car thefts and car and home burglaries are

<tt>The US  is reportedly worried about the booming drug trade in Mexico;
Mexico earned an estimated $7 billion in 1994 by shipping Colombian drugs into
the US, or almost twice as much as remittances from Mexican workers in the US.
Some of the money used to buy newly-privatized companies in Mexico was
reportedly drug money.  Some US officials fear that the police in Mexico have
been largely compromised by accepting money to protect drug barons. </tt><p>

Border Controls</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Schengen agreement, designed to abolish border controls between the
seven signatories, went into effect on March 26, 1995, and passport controls
were scheduled to be phased out on July 1, 1995.  Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain ended passport controls on their common
borders on July 1 as scheduled.  France used a safety clause in the Schengen
agreement to maintain its border controls, citing fears of illegal immigration
after the EU denied a request for a six-month extension. </tt><p>
<tt>France cited fears of illegal immigration from some of its Schengen
partners as the reason why it would maintain passport controls for another six
months.  France noted that, in the three months since Schengen went into effect
on March 26, 1995, four of the seven member nations had failed to report to
Schengen computers any stolen identity documents, and only one had reported any
stolen cars.  France also complained that drug traffic along its northern
borders increased by almost 60 percent in April-May 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners refused entry to France fell by two-thirds in
April-May 1995, which the National Front said demonstrates France's failure to
control its own borders.</tt><p>
<tt>Most commentaries decried the French refusal to join in border-free Europe,
since France is one of the most ardent supporters of European integration.
Many asserted that France delayed Schengen implementation for fear of further
strengthening the National Front, which has asserted that under Schengen,
illegal immigration to France will increase.</tt><p>
<tt>The French decision bolsters the position of the UK, which argues that
border-free Europe would increase illegal immigration and criminal
activities.</tt><p>
<tt>The EU is scheduled to release a plan in July 1995 to remove passport
controls between all member nations, which would be equivalent to extending
Schengen to all EU member nations.</tt><p>
<tt>The election of several National Front mayors in local French elections in
June obscured the fact that only two of France's 225 cities of 30,000 or more
have National Front mayors.  Indeed, there are so many local positions in
France--over 500,000--that about one percent of the French population holds
some local office.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC14">Regulating
the German Labor Market</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Germany probably spends more to prevent the employment of illegal foreign
workers than any other country; about five times more per worker than the US.
</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, there were over 78,000 inspections of German employers suspected
of employing illegal aliens, and almost half (42,000) led to fines of DM 24
million (US $17 million) and/or warnings.  The INS fined US employers $11
million in 1994 for employing illegal aliens and/or not completing I-9
forms.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany has about 1,500 labor market inspectors and, at an annual cost of
about DM 100,000 (US $70,000) per inspector, the Labor Ministry spends about DM
150 million (US $110 million) annually to, e.g., prevent German workers from
drawing UI benefits while working and to prevent illegal foreign workers from
finding jobs.  In a labor market with about 40 million workers, Germany spends
almost $3 per worker on labor law enforcement.  </tt><p>
<tt>The US, by contrast, had 245 INS worksite investigators in 1994, and an
additional 900 Department of Labor inspectors.  At an average cost of $75,000
per inspector, the US spends $86 million annually on federal labor law
enforcement, or $0.66 per worker.</tt><p>
<tt>German officials believe that the desire to preserve a generous welfare
state and an orderly labor market helps them to obtain the resources necessary
for effective enforcement.  For example, German labor inspectors can obtain
local police support for worksite inspections at no cost to the labor ministry;
when four or five labor inspectors enter a construction site, for example, they
may have 50 or 100 local police to surround the site and prevent workers from
running away.  </tt><p>
<tt>German enforcement officials report that German firms try to avoid negative
publicity, so they tend to pay rather than contest fines.  If a German firm
contests a fine, its name can be made public.  Fines are registered with local
chambers of commerce, and public agencies and other firms can require employers
bidding for contracts to provide information about that firm's labor law
violations.</tt><p>
<tt>The German Labor Ministry announced that it would conduct intensive
investigations of illegal employment in Brandenburg, the state surrounding
Berlin, beginning in summer 1995.  Berlin is currently the largest construction
project in Europe, and perhaps the world, and thousands of foreign workers have
streamed into the city to seek construction jobs.   </tt><p>
<tt>There are currently 43 labor inspectors in Brandenburg, a labor market with
just under one million workers.  For the next two years, another 150 inspectors
will be added, which means that in the Berlin area, DM20 million (US $14
million) per year, or about $14 per worker, will be spent to detect and
discourage labor law violations.</tt><p>
<tt>The employment of legal foreign workers from elsewhere in the EU in Berlin
prompted the German Labor Ministry on June 27 to push for a new law to raise
the wages that must be paid to EU construction workers in Germany beginning in
Fall 1995.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the so-called Entsendereglung proposal, EU construction workers with
freedom of movement rights would have to be paid at least the minimum wage
negotiated between German construction unions and construction companies,
currently about 20DM (US$ 14) per hour, plus offer them the same vacation pay
available to unionized German workers [payroll taxes add about 70 percent or DM
14 (US $ 10) to the hourly wage for German workers].  Employers violating this
law, which would remain in effect only for two years, could be fined up to
DM50,000 (US $ 35,000).</tt><p>
<tt>The opposition SPD claims that the new law does not go far enough and wants
the government to require employers to pay all workers in Germany full German
wages and benefits.  The SPD would also ban low-wage workers from all
industries, not just construction. </tt><p>
<tt>The 1.4 million workers in the German construction industry, plus 800,000
in associated industries, include about 150,000 foreign workers.  The
foreigners include 110,000 from EU nations such as the UK, Ireland, and
Portugal, and 35,000 East Europeans, mostly from Poland and the Czech Republic.
</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign workers are paid as little as DM6 (US $ 4.25)per hour, and they do
not receive German benefits, since they are considered employees of e.g.,
British or Irish firms and temporarily assigned to Germany.  EU workers have
the right to enter Germany and seek most jobs on an equal basis with German
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>In several cases, Dutch firms founded construction firms in Portugal, and
the Portuguese firm made an agreement with a German firm to provide workers for
DM 20 to 30 (US $14 to $20) per hour.  The Portuguese workers were paid DM 6 to
8 (US $ 4.25 to $5.60), and the Dutch firm kept the difference, satisfying all
parties involved, but producing unemployment and complaints from German
construction workers.</tt><p>
<tt>Many foreigners are prepared to perform tasks deemed too dangerous by
German builders.  Most work a 70-hour week, almost twice as long as their
German counterparts.</tt><p>
<tt>There are currently 137,000 unemployed German construction workers, and
bankruptcies among small German construction firms rose 24 percent in 1994 over
1993.  Unemployed German construction workers receive an average DM40,000 (US $
28,000) per year in unemployment insurance benefits.</tt><p>
<tt>In addition to employing EU workers at lower-than-German wages, many
British workers allegedly claim to be self-employed carpenters or masons who
migrate to Germany to offer their services under the freedom of services
provisions of the EU.  Germans allege that they are not truly "independent
contractors," and thus are not exempt from payroll taxes and minimum wages
because, inter alia, they are often (illegally) supervised on German work
sites, and they are not enrolled in local German associations of independent
contractors.  </tt><p>
<tt>Germany has proposed that all independent contractors from other EU
countries be required to register with the local craftspersons' association,
which would review each applicant's credentials before granting
certificates.</tt><p>
<tt>A sweep of hotels and restaurants involving 3,600 inspectors and police in
March 1995 found that 830 of the 3,600 restaurants checked had illegal foreign
workers.  About 6,000 or 43 percent of the 15,000 employees were foreigners who
were required to have work permits, and 1,300 of them (22 percent) did not.
Two-thirds of the 15,000 restaurant employees did not have their social
insurance cards on them, as required in construction, hotels and restaurants,
and in fairs and other temporary exhibitions.</tt><p>
<tt>Germany continues to debate whether its regulated labor market and social
welfare system slows down job growth and increases unemployment.  Between 1982
and 1993, Germany created 3.25 million net new jobs, and an additional 1.4
million net new jobs are expected to be created by 1999.  German firms created
an estimated 70,000 jobs abroad in 1994, a trend that worries those who want to
preserve Germany's lead in manufacturing.  German employers argue that
Germany's high business taxes must be reduced, and that labor market and
business regulations eased in order to keep Germany competitive.  </tt><p>
<tt>The argument over whether an inclusive social safety net hurts
competitiveness is being waged in many European countries.  Employers complain
that strict labor laws discourage weekend and night work, so that expensive
capital equipment is not fully used, while sick leave that averages one month
or 22 days per year, plus four- to six-week paid vacations, leave German
workers with too few workdays.</tt><p>
<tt>German employers recommend relaxing labor laws, ending store closing
requirements--most stores must currently close at 6:30 p.m. and on Saturday
afternoons and Sundays--and permitting households to deduct the wages paid to
maids, which employers estimate could create an estimated 500,000 to 600,000
jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>There have in 1995 been fewer predictions of the German and European "need"
for immigrants to offset the demographic reality of aging populations and
declining labor forces.  The EU commissioned studies in 1993 that concluded
that, without immigration, the EU population would decline by about three
percent between 1990 and 2020, to 333 million and, at current labor force
participation rates, the EU labor force would decline by eight percent, from
157 million to 144 million.</tt><p>
<tt>To maintain the EU population and labor force at early 1990s levels, the EU
would have to admit 900,000 immigrants annually, including 400,000 per year
into Germany, 200,000 per year to Italy, 80,000 per year to Spain, 60,000 per
year to France, and 50,000 per year or less for the all other EU nations except
Ireland.</tt><p>
<tt>Correction: The July 1995 issue of Migration News mistakenly reported that
German negotiations with Vietnam were concluded and repatriations would begin
in summer 1995.  A final agreement was not signed until July 21, 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the agreement, about 40,000 Vietnamese nationals in Germany without
valid documents are to be returned to Vietnam.  The final sticking point in the
negotiations was Vietnam's demand that those being deported from Germany are in
fact Vietnamese citizens.  It was agreed that nationality would be determined
by birth certificates, seaman's papers, drivers license, witnesses, or the
person's own admission.  Germany has also agreed to give Vietnam US $72 million
in development aid. </tt><p>
<tt>There is some dispute about the number of Vietnamese living in Germany and
how many are subject to repatriation.  Of the 60,000 Vietnamese who were
working in East Germany in 1989-90, about 15,000 are still in Germany.  Over 80
percent of them have a residence status that will allow them to attain
permanent residence by 2001, which is in some cases 19 years after their
arrival.</tt><p>
<tt>Some Vietnamese residents--including rejected asylum seekers-- have a
"Duldung" ("tolerance"), which in most cases does NOT allow them to work.
These Vietnamese could be repatriated under the agreement.  Together with
asylum-seekers whose applications have not yet been decided, but who are likely
to be rejected, some estimate that 20,000 Vietnamese could be deported,
although most newspapers quote the government's 40,000 estimate. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Brit</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>ish
Crackdown on Immigrant Benefit</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>s
</a></h2>
<tt>Claiming that nearly L100 million a year is lost in immigrant benefit
fraud, the British Home Secretary announced a crackdown to spot suspected
illegal aliens in welfare offices, hospitals and universities.  The crackdown
includes: stopping non-contributory benefits for illegal or temporary
residents, tightening access to student awards and loans, legislation to make
non citizens ineligible for social housing, and asking hospital trusts and
general practitioners to prevent ineligible foreigners from getting access to
free NHS treatment.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most of these measures are not expected to be implemented until
1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Four government departments will work closely with the Home Office on these
proposals - prompting concern that the Department of Education and Employment
will encourage head teachers to see if any of their pupils come from families
of illegal immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The Department of the Environment will ensure that people from abroad are
not entitled to council houses; the Department of Social Security has already
tightened up procedures to prevent illegal immigrants from claiming income
support, housing benefits and council tax benefits.  The Department of Health
will work on better ways to control access to free NHS treatment.</tt><p>
<tt>Some teachers and health professionals were angry that they would be asked
to become immigration police.  Unision, the public services union, claimed that
the plan was an attempt to get immigration enforcement "on the cheap," and
would undermine the integrity of public service. </tt><p>
<tt>No one knows how many illegal aliens are in the UK; estimates range from
20,000 to 1 million.  In 1994, 5,032 illegal aliens were apprehended in the
UK.</tt><p>
<tt>The British Home Office says that the number of illegal immigrants has
almost doubled since 1989 to an estimated 13,000 in 1994.  In 1994, 23,000 of
the 66,000 passengers stopped at posts and airports were refused entry,
compared to 17,000 of 61,000 in 1992. </tt><p>
<tt>Newspaper stories report that there continue to be large numbers of sham
marriages in the UK.  Marriage to a British national includes the right to live
permanently in the UK after a one-year probationary period, and it is asserted
that especially ethnic youth are attracted to the $500 to $2,000 paid for
marrying a foreigner.  An investigation revealed that, in one office, 146 of
154 marriages involving Ghanaians and Nigerians were bogus<b>.</b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>France in December 1994 proposed that all EU nations introduce
employer sanctions, and that public servants be required to report suspected
illegal aliens to immigration agencies.  The UK has 800 immigration officers
who deal with internal enforcement, but no employer sanctions or reporting
requirements.</tt><p>

Deports Illegal Immigrants</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The French interior ministry announced that it plans to double the number
of illegal aliens deported from 10,000 to 20,000 per year.  About 45,000
illegal aliens are apprehended in France each year, and the government
announced that it would initiate weekly deportation flights.</tt><p>
<tt>France expelled 81 Romanians, mostly gypsies, this month and many
complained that French police physically abused them.  A week later, 43
undocumented Africans were deported to Zaire.  The French Interior Minster
warned that the highly publicized expulsions, following the suspension of  the
Schengen open-border agreement, demonstrated France's determination to halt
illegal immigration. </tt><p>
<tt>Amnesty International criticized France on July 12 for expelling the
Romanian migrants, saying that it has found that members of Romania's large
gypsy minority were sometimes jailed, solely on grounds of ethnic origin, for
disturbing public order.</tt><p>
<tt>The new French government has announced that its top priority is to create
jobs--700,000 by the end of 1996.  French employers have been offered wage
subsidies if they hire unemployed youth and adults who have been unemployed for
one year or more.</tt><p>
<tt>France became a magnet for North Africans, in part because of fringe
benefits guaranteed by law: six-week vacations, mandated health care and a
$1,3000 monthly minimum wage.  But these same social protections, are also
expensive.  There is continued rhetoric, that if three million immigrants were
expelled, there will be jobs for the three million unemployed French. </tt><p>
<tt>Observers say tensions are especially high in southeastern France, where
many of the North Africans settled.  A leading Algerian political activist
warns that it could all end very badly, as tensions continue to rise. </tt><p>
<tt>French farmers in April 1995 stopped trucks bringing Spanish strawberries
to France and destroyed them.  The EU Commission threatened to bring France
before the EU Court of Justice for failing to prosecute the farmers involved in
disrupting internal EU trade.  Spanish strawberries are reportedly cheaper than
French berries because of the availability of cheap labor in Spain and the
devalued peseta.</tt><p>

Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a><a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></h2>
<tt>Spain, which is only 10 miles from North Africa at the Strait of Gibraltar,
seems to worry less about immigration from North Africa than France and Italy.
One reason is that, for historical reason, Spain has far fewer its nationals
living in the Maghreb countries than does either France or Italy.  </tt><p>
<tt>Spain took over the EU Presidency on July 1, 1995, and is expected to
follow France in shifting EU attention and aid to North Africa at an
EU-Mediterranean conference in Barcelona in November.  Some observers note that
Spain spends less of its GDP on defense than any other EU nation--just over one
percent--so that the country hopes for the best, but is ill-prepared for the
worst.</tt><p>
<tt>Europe's southern members states are particularly concerned that further
political destabilization in North Africa, compounded by economic collapse,
could trigger an increase in the number of Algerians, Moroccans and Tunisians
seeking asylum in western Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>In Cannes at the end of June, government officials from France, Spain and
Italy persuaded the EU to pledge $6.1 billion in assistance over five years to
North African countries, arguing that economic instability in North Africa was
as threatening to the EU as crime and illegal immigration from Eastern Europe
threatened northern Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>A similar ad package of $8.7 billion was pledged for Eastern Europe.

Smuggling</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>In early July, 18 Sri Lankans were found dead in a locked shipping
container about 20 miles east of the Austrian border, where they had been left
by the driver who was to take them illegally to Germany.  Most had paid from
$800 to $5,000 to be flown to Moscow on 10-day student visas, then taken by
truck and train across Eastern Europe.  The final leg of the journey was in
shipping containers that held 18 to 20 persons each mounted on trucks.</tt><p>
<tt>Many of the Sri Lankans sold assets at home to finance the trip.  Some
reported that they were told they would receive DM10,000 and a job upon their
arrival in Germany.  </tt><p>
<tt>Alien smuggling is believed to be a $1 billion per year business.  In the
first half of this year, Hungarian authorities found more than 4,000 illegal
immigrants and arrested more than 200 human smugglers.  Corresponding figures
for the same period last year were somewhat less than 4,000 illegal  migrants
and 140 immigrant smugglers.</tt><p>
<tt>Polish employment officials estimate that the number of illegal foreign
nationals working the country is more than 100,000.  The State Labour
Inspectorate claims that the figure may be as high as 200,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most illegal foreign workers in Poland come from Russia, the Ukraine and
Belarus, but in border towns, there are also illegals from Vietnam, Bulgaria
and Romania, many working as street vendors.</tt><p>
<tt>Since March 1995, Lithuania has tightened controls along its border with
Poland to prevent alien smuggling.  In February, 1995, before the controls, 17
Lithuanian planes flew to Poland with planeloads of refugees.  </tt><p>
<tt>Poland claims that the flights are organized by illegal transport companies
who are moving Asians to the West via Moscow.  Officials expect that with the
tightening of the border with Poland, smugglers will shift their operations to
Belarus and the Ukraine. </tt><p>
<tt>Lithuania became the first of the Baltic countries to adopt a law on
refugees and asylum seekers.  According to the UNHCR, the legislation means
that asylum seekers in Lithuania will no longer be considered illegal migrants,
and they will not face detention or deportation.</tt><p>
<tt>Some estimate that there are 500,000 illegal aliens around Moscow,
20,000</tt><p>
<tt>illegal Chinese aliens warehoused in Prague, 30,000 in Austria and
perhaps</tt><p>
<tt>100,000 in France, most of them bound eventually for the United
States.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC20">Philippines
</a></a>Tries to Protect Overseas
Workers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The Philippine government is fighting the exploitation of its overseas
workers on several fronts.  On July 16, the Migrant Worker and Overseas
Employment Act went in effect.  The Gancayco Commission, formed after the
hanging of a Filipina maid in Singapore, issued its recommendations in
mid-July.  </tt><p>
<tt>Under the new migrant law, overcharging by employment agencies and all
other acts of illegal recruitment are punishable by a jail term from six years
and one day to 12 years, plus a fine of P200,000 to P500,000 (US $ 7,900 to
$20,000).  If three or more persons jointly victimize "three or more persons
individually or as a group," then the crime becomes "economic sabotage," with a
maximum penalty of a life in prison and a fine from P500,000 to P1 million (US
$20,000 to $40,000). </tt><p>
<tt>An alliance of about 500 overseas employment agencies stopped sending
Filipino workers abroad on July 17 to protest the new law.  The employment
agencies say that the regulations are unfair to licensed placement agencies.
Private recruiters are now preparing to ask the Supreme Court to halt the
implementation of the new law. </tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine labor force is about 16 million, and eight million are
reportedly on "labor-only contracts," which makes them dependent on an
employment agency rather than an employer.  Estimates of workers abroad and
remittances vary--most estimate that perhaps four million Filipinos work
abroad, and that their $5 billion annual remittances at least partially support
one-fifth of the population. </tt><p>
<tt>The Gancayco Commission recommended a halt to the deployment of women
migrant workers by the year 2000 to the countries of Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar.  After questions were raised about
the constitutionality of a ban on emigration to specific countries, the
commission softened its recommendation to a "travel advisory."  The commission
also recommended a ban on allowing women entertainers, except musicians and
artists, to travel for employment to Japan, Greece and Cyprus. </tt><p>
<tt>Non-government organizations were critical of these recommendations, saying
that prohibiting overseas employment would serve no purpose unless the
government can create jobs at home. </tt><p>
<tt>The commission recommended streamlining and reviewing recruitment
procedures to monitor the number of workers seeking jobs abroad.  Consulates
and immigration officers were told to provide maximum assistance to workers
abroad and watch for illegal recruiters.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippine legalization program effective June 1995 has attracted only
1,710 applicants.  Government officials estimate that there are 150,000 illegal
aliens in the country.  The program expires at the end of 1996.  Most of the
applicants who have applied for amnesty are from China, Taiwan and India.
</tt><p>
<tt>For about $10,000, a foreigner who entered the country illegally before
June 20, 1992 can acquire permanent residency status.  Once his stay has been
legalized, he can be naturalized as a Filipino citizen in five years, half the
usual time.  The government expects about $78.2 million to be generated from
the program. </tt><p>
<tt>President Ramos said on July 19 that the country plans to normalize
relations with Singapore, which soured following the hanging of a Filipina maid
in April.</tt><p>
<tt>The Philippines, sometimes dismissed as the "sick man of Asia," embarked on
an ambitious Philippines 2000 plan to close the gap with its fast-growing Asian
neighbors over the next five years.  </tt><p>
<tt>One strategy for creating jobs for the 800,000 workers join the labor force
every year is to promote foreign investment in free trade zones, that in early
1995 employed about 200,000 Filipinos, three-fourths of them women.  In most of
these factories, workers are paid the minimum wage of 138 pesos (US $ 5.40) per
day.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Taiwan's Council of Labor Affairs announced that, after the country joins
the World Trade Organization, foreign workers will be put on the same footing
as local workers.  Currently, the CLA sets a minimum wage that employers must
pay to foreign workers that is typically less than the wage paid to local
workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The CLA asserted that the number of foreign workers imported will be cut in
half unless the employers and foreign labor agents take responsibility for the
growing number of runaway foreign laborers.</tt><p>
<tt>Taiwan's National Police Administration reported that 10,000 foreign
workers--about five percent of the 220,000 foreign workers in the country--
have abandoned their legal jobs, either to switch to a higher-wage job than
they were assigned at entry, or because their two-year work permits were about
to expire.  Runaways are expected to increase as the two-year work permits
granted to them in 1993 expire.  In 1992, Taiwan required some foreign workers
to depart, including some who had been legally in the country for more than
five years.</tt><p>
<tt>The Council is considering bypassing employment recruiters and having
employers hire workers directly from foreign countries.  It is also considering
an increase in the current maximum three-year prison term for illegal alien
workers.  In July, the government set up two telephone hotlines for local
people to report runaway foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>There are estimated to be at least 25,000 illegal alien workers in Taiwan,
making illegals equivalent to about 10 percent of legal workers.  The Ministry
of Justice announced on June 19 a crackdown of Chinese overstayers, many of
whom work in construction.  The immigration department will also try to deter
illegal entrants who sail from the Chinese mainland or enter through a third
country such as Macao or Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 14, the Council of Labor Affairs announced that more than 4,000
foreign workers would be allowed into Taiwan to work in six manufacturing
industries.  COLA statistics showed that the manufacturing industries had an
employment shortfall of some 86,000 workers in 1993, and that number had
dropped to 63,000 as of September of 1994.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The Malaysian government says it is losing about US $960 million dollars a
year in foreign exchange because of remittances by foreign workers.  The
government estimates that each of the nearly one million foreign workers sends
home about $80 US per month. [In Lebanon, 700,000 foreign workers, mostly
Syrians, earn an estimated 20 percent of that nation's income.]</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian government warned that the country's reliance on foreign
labor in only temporary, and the deputy home minister claimed that the presence
of over one million foreign workers is a serious threat to security.</tt><p>
<tt>On July 15 the government extended for another two years the three-year
work permits of foreign workers in construction, manufacturing, and hotels and
restaurants.  The decision to extend the passes was criticized by some unions,
but praised by the construction industry.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Trades Union Congress cited examples of abuse of foreign
workers and demanded that the government prevent further mistreatment. </tt><p>
<tt>The government will continue to allow gas stations to have two foreign
workers for every Malaysian employed, although the industry had requested more.
Five-year work passes for plantation workers will continue to be issued.  The
government stopped issuing work passes for foreign caddies at golf courses, but
employers can continue to use foreign caddies until their current work permits
expires.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Home Ministry warned foreign workers that they face a maximum
fine of M$300 (US $ 123) or court action if they illegally change jobs.  Many
foreign workers have work permits restricting them to work as maids, and they
have been found to be working illegally in restaurants, grocery stores, offices
and in entertainment.  Employers face of maximum fine of M$10,000 (US $4,000)
or five years' imprisonment or both upon conviction.</tt><p>
<tt>The Bangladeshi government is concerned about the large number of illegal
Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia, and plans to try to curb illegal labor
exports. Bangladesh's labor exports to Malaysia slowed down in recent months as
the Malaysian government discussed new policies to curb the influx of illegal
foreign workers.  </tt><p>
<tt>As of June, 1995, a total of 161,067 Bangladeshis were employed in Malaysia
with valid documents, while 60,000 to 70,000 Bangladeshi labors are believed to
be working illegally.  Of these, about 26,000 are to be legalized.  About 3,200
Bangladeshi illegal workers are being held in Malaysian detention camps.</tt><p>

of Chinese Farmers</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The Chinese vice premier says that China will face major social and
political problems if it does not find work for the nearly 200 million farmers
who will be unemployed by the year 2000.  Of the 120 million current surplus
farmers, nearly 80 million have already left farm work for urban areas.  Though
the farmers have helped meet the current urban labor shortages, they are blamed
for increased crime, overcrowded transport system and a rise in birth rate.
</tt><p>
<tt>Two Chinese economists have called on the government to change the
household registration system to make it easier for farmers to move to the
cities, where they earn money to send home and learn skills.  In the first six
months of 1995, the average rural resident earned US$ 91, while his urban
cousin earned US$ 237, official figures show.</tt><p>
<tt>A July 9 front-page editorial in the People's Daily said that the rural
exodus of peasants seeking work in cities is straining urban facilities and
causing labor shortages in rural areas.  The editorial coincided with the
opening of a national conference on migrants.  </tt><p>
<tt>In order to stem the flow of farmers to the cities, the newspaper urged the
government to strengthen agricultural production and develop small township
enterprises to provide other sources of employment.</tt><p>
<tt>The State Bureau of Foreign Experts is trying to resolve disputes between
foreign experts and their Chinese employers.  Such disputes often arise when
Chinese employers do not live up to contract terms involving air
transportation, pay, and working and living conditions.  Some foreign experts
demand more holidays and sometimes leave their jobs without notice. </tt><p>
<tt>China employs about 30,000 foreign experts each year, 30 percent of whom
work for universities, publishing houses, research institutes and hospitals.
</tt><p>
<tt>Tibet's Dali Lama has claimed that thousands of ethnic Han Chinese
immigrants are streaming into Tibet as part of a Chinese plan to overwhelm the
local Tibetan population.  </tt><p>
<tt>The vice-chair of the regional Tibetan government counters that there are
18,000 Han working in Tibet, accounting for less than 30 percent of the workers
employed by the government.  Most of the workers will return to their home
provinces when they reach 30 years of age.</tt><p>
<tt>Tibet has a population of two million.  Han visitors are not permitted to

</a></h2>
<tt>High rent and labor costs are driving many unskilled jobs to China.  Hong
Kong officials, accustomed to full employment, were shocked when unemployment
hit an eight-year high of three percent in May.  The government, which has
traditionally taken a hands-off approach, has stepped up its efforts to help
service workers find jobs. </tt><p>
<tt>In June, paging operator companies received permission to service calls
from southern China, where wages are only $260 per month, instead of $1,100 per
month in Hong Kong.  Industry analysts expect the entire paging industry to
move to China, a loss of 30,000 Hong Kong jobs.</tt><p>
<tt>An estimated 10 percent of Hong Kong's six million residents have taken out
citizenship or the right to citizenship in another country as a protection for
their families if the 1997 transition to Chinese rule is bumpy. </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong's minority groups with no travel documents except the British
Dependent Territories Citizen papers or a British National Overseas passport
are entitled to neither Chinese nor British nationality.  These minority groups
have no nationality or guaranteed right of abode; they can only remain in Hong
Kong as long as the Chinese allow them to remain.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many are Indians who expected the British government to welcome them to
Britain but, as 1997 approaches, they are not being granted British
nationality.  They have lobbied British Members of Parliament for 10 years,
hoping to get special consideration for British passports.  </tt><p>
<tt>The success rate for minorities applying for British passports is about 60
percent, the same for the rest of the population--despite promises from the
British government that the applications from non-Chinese would be only a
fraction of the total.  Many minorities say they want British passports, not to
go the Britain, but to stay in Hong Kong.  They also want an escape should
things go wrong after the Chinese gain control of Hong Kong in 1997. </tt><p>
<tt>The UNHCR director warned that there is a possibility that Vietnamese boat
people who do not return to their native home before the 1997 handover of Hong
Kong, may be sent to re-education camps or jails on the Chinese mainland.  In
July, 1995, there were two incidents when some of the 22,000 Vietnamese being
detained in Hong Kong escaped.  Most were recaptured. </tt><p>
<tt>The escalation of housing prices in Hong Kong has made the average
middle-class apartment in Hong Kong worth more than the minimum investment
required to enter most countries under their business immigration policies.
</tt><p>
<tt>Increasingly, Filipina maids in Hong Kong are working outside the home, a
violation of their employment contracts.  About 600 of the maids claim they are
forced to work in violation of their labor contract by their employers.  Last
year, over 160 Filipinas were charged with unapproved employment. This year the
numbers are expected to be significantly higher.  The Labor and Immigration
Departments encourage domestic workers to report their employers, but the
Filipina maids fear losing their jobs, being jailed, and then deported. </tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>The Singapore government announced that, after August 1, white-collar
foreign workers and their employers could no longer contribute to the country's
national pension fund.  After numerous complaints, the government reconsidered
and allowed foreigners already in Singapore to continue making tax-exempt
contributions to the Central Provident Fund until December 1998.  Foreign
workers complained that the proposal would have reduced their wages by an
estimated 20 percent. </tt><p>
<tt>Companies and employees must each make a contribution of 20 percent of
their wage to the CPF.  Expatriate workers can only withdraw money from the
fund when their Singapore contract expires.  Under the old plan, contributions
were tax exempt, but under the new rules, contributions after 1998 will be
considered voluntary, and therefore subject to tax. </tt><p>
<tt>About 300,000 work permit holders are already exempt from making pension
payments under Singapore's Foreign Worker Levy Scheme.  Foreign maids and
construction workers are excluded from the pension plan. </tt><p>

<tt>There were 78,852 foreign workers in Korea in April 1995, including 54,300
illegal workers who arrived with tourist visas and failed to depart, according
to the Korean government.  Most illegal workers are from China, the
Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan.  Another report said there were 130,000
foreign workers, about 100,000 of them illegal. </tt><p>
<tt>Immigration laws have now tightened so that immigrants wanting illegal
entry have to pay about a million won (US $1,200) in brokerage fees. </tt><p>
<tt>In May 1994, the Korean government launched a trainee system under which up
to 25,000 industrial trainees from abroad could work and learn in Korea.
Trainees are paid about $200 per month, and they have few rights under Korean
labor law.  Abut one-fourth of the trainees abandon their jobs, and illegally
go to work for wages of $400 to $600 per month.</tt><p>

<tt>South Africa is a nation bordered by impoverished neighbors.  The per
capita income in South Africa is $2,560 compared to Mozambique's $80 and $650
in Zimbabwe.  </tt><p>
<tt>The South African army estimates that the number of illegal immigrants in
the country is about five million (12 percent of the population), but admits
that there could be as many eight million (20 percent). Many of the  illegal
immigrants are from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Lesotho, and many who work in
sugarcane or on cotton farms.  In the first five months of 1995, the army
captured 2,247 illegal immigrants crossing the border without documents.</tt><p>
<tt>The South African government is reluctant to offend neighboring countries
who sheltered many of those escaping apartheid.  At the same time, resentment
against illegal immigrants in South Africa is rising.  The Johannesburg-based
Center for Policy Studies reported that a majority of South Africans hold
illegal immigrants responsible for the nation's high unemployment rate,
homelessness, and other social problems. </tt><p>
<tt>Some in the government would like to see longtime illegal immigrants given
South African citizenship.  Others want a regional migration policy with
quotas, and still others call for the development of impoverished neighboring
states to remove the economic incentive to leave. </tt><p>
<tt>The South African police report that Swaziland has become a major avenue
for illegal immigrants to enter South Africa.  A Swazi syndicate is providing
false documents that illegal immigrants use to get into the country.  Many of
the illegal aliens arrested told border police that controls are tighter along
the Mozambican border than the Swazi border.</tt><p>
<tt>The South African army is urging the government step up the voltage on a
fence that runs between the Mozambique border and South Africa's Kruger
National Park to Swaziland<b> </b>to prevent illegal entry.  South Africa in
1990 changed the setting on the electric fences on its borders from lethal
shocks to a setting that provides only a mild shock.  </tt><p>
<tt>The fence was originally erected to make crossings by guerrillas of the
African National Congress more hazardous from 1986 to 1989.  Human rights
groups argue that the fence will not stop illegal immigration. </tt><p>

<tt>DOL's ILAB has released a report that tabulates employment data on
foreign-and native-born adults in the US in March 1994.  There were 22 million
foreign-born adults and 179 million native-born adults, so that foreign-born
persons were 11 percent of the US adult population. </tt><p>
<tt>The 13 million foreign-born adults in the US labor force in March 1994 were
10 percent of the 130 million strong labor force.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign-born adults were less likely to be in the labor force than
native-born adults (13 of 22 million or 59 percent of the foreign born, and 117
of 179 million or 65 percent of the native born); the gap for foreign-born
women was especially large.  Foreign-born adults were also more likely to be
unemployed than the native-born (9.2 percent for the foreign-born, and 6.8
percent for the native born).</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign-born adults have a much different education distribution than
native-born adults--the foreign-born are more likely to have a college degree
or more, OR to have less than a ninth- grade education, than are native born
adults. If foreign-born adults are arrayed by their years of education, the
result is an hourglass shape, reflecting their concentration at the extremes of
the education distribution.  Native-born adults, by contrast, generate a
diamond-shaped distribution.</tt><p>
<tt>The contrast between foreign-and native-born adults is sharpest in
agriculture--only five percent of the self-employed farmers are foreign-born,
versus 26 percent of the wage and salary farm workers.  Most of the
foreign-born adult farm workers were Hispanics from Mexico--Hispanics were 50
percent of the foreign-born adults in the US, and 86 percent of the
foreign-born farm workers.  About 72 percent of the foreign-born farm workers,
versus eight percent of the native born farm workers--had less than nine years
of schooling.</tt><p>
<tt>Over half of the foreign-born farm workers were in California, versus six
percent of the native-born farm workers.  The CPS, which asks about employment
in March, does not include most of the foreign-born farm workers--many are not
employed in March, and others arrive in April and May and stay in the US only
until September or October.   </tt><p>
<tt>About five percent of the foreign-born workers were employed by federal,
state, or local governments, versus almost 20 percent of the native-born labor
force.  About 10 percent of both the foreign-born and the native-born were
self-employed.</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign- and native- born adults have very different industry and
occupational distributions.  In nine broad industrial sectors, foreigners are
disproportionately represented in agriculture and manufacturing, and
under-represented in mining, transportation, and public administration.
</tt><p>
<tt>Foreign-born adults are more likely to have farming or operative/laborer or
service occupations than the native born, 47 percent versus 31 percent, and
less likely to have the most common US occupation--technical, sales, or
support.</tt><p>
<tt>There are significant differences in foreign-born and native-born workers
by industry and occupation.  For example, 63 percent of those employed in
California agriculture are foreign born, versus 13 percent of those employed in
New York agriculture in March 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>There are almost 100 million "families" in the US, and about nine million
are headed by foreign-born persons.  There are significantly more husband-wife
households among the foreign born (70 percent) than among the native born (53
percent), but the foreign-born husband-wife families had much lower 1993
incomes, $32,000 versus $43,000.  </tt><p>
<tt>In the states with the most foreign-born persons, one-fourth of all
foreign-born families had incomes in 1993 that were below the poverty
line.</tt><p>
<tt>NB.  In late July, the House voted to reduce ILAB's funding by 86 percent,
which may wipe out the US Department of Labor's $700,000 per year immigration
research program.  ILAB supported the collection of data on IRCA-legalized
aliens (Westat survey), and has supported research of many aspects of the labor
market effects of immigration.  </tt><p>

<tt>The OECD in June 1995 released Trends in International Migration:  1994
Annual Report, which found that immigration flows into OECD nations stabilized
in 1993 and 1994 as a result of changes in asylum systems, and changes in
immigration countries entry criteria.  The report expressed the hope that, with
fewer entries, OECD countries could turn their attention to integrating
newly-arrived immigrants and their children.</tt><p>
<tt>The report emphasizes that economic recovery or labor shortages in the
immigration countries, or recession and instability in emigration counties,
could increase migration again.  The report seemed to endorse more immigration,
noting that Canada, Germany and the United States had increased immigration
since 1988 without noticeable negative economic effects.</tt><p>
<tt>The OECD report identifies three key migration trends--fewer asylum
seekers, more unskilled temporary foreign workers, and more highly-skilled
migrants.</tt><p>
<tt>According to the report, the 1993 foreign populations in European countries
ranged from 6.9 million in Germany to 3.6 million in France to two million in
the UK and 1.3 million in Switzerland.  About half of the foreigners in each of
these countries were in the labor force:  Germany had 3.4 million foreign
workers; France 1.5 million; the UK, 1 million; and Switzerland, 700,000 (in
some cases, temporary or seasonal foreign workers are included, although the
foreign population data refer only to settlers).</tt><p>
<tt>In 1993, Germany took 990,000 foreigners, including 320,000 asylum seekers.
Half of the asylum-seekers arriving in OECD countries in 1993 were from Europe,
usually from former Yugoslavia, Romania and Turkey.  In 1993, Germany
recognized four percent of asylum applicants as refugees, Belgium, Italy and
Norway recognized about 10 percent; France, 28 percent; and Canada, 50
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>In April 1995, Eurostat published a report entitled "International
Migration in the EU Member States - 1992" that put net immigration into the
15-member EU at 1.2 million in 1992.  Net immigration to the EU was close to
zero in 1984, reached 1 million in 1990, and may have peaked in 1992.
According to Eurostat, net immigration to Europe is increasing as immigration
flows rise and emigration remains stable.  </tt><p>
<tt>Most immigrants to EU member nations are Europeans--from 60 to 90 percent
in all EU nations except Sweden where less than half of the immigrants are from
Europe.</tt><p>
<tt>For example, Germany in 1992 had 1.5 million immigrant arrivals, and
720,000 emigrant departures, according to Eurostat.  Germany received
two-thirds of the immigrant arrivals to the EU in 1992, and accounted for 60
percent of the EU's emigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>Immigrants in these data include returning citizens.  In Denmark, Greece,
Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom, half of all 1992 "immigrants" are
returning citizens.</tt><p>
