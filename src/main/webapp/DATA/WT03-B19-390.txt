<B>Scientific uncertainty over climate change has led some people to doubt the 
need for a vigorous policy response.</B> Although most scientists believe that human 
activities are changing the climate, they do not agree on the rate at which it will occur, nor 
on its specific impacts (fact sheets 1 and 9). This makes it difficult to put a "price tag" on 
either climate change or on policies to prevent it (fact sheets 228 and 229). Nevertheless, 
the seriousness of the potential damage and the availability of cost-effective policies are 
strong arguments for taking immediate action to minimize climate change.<P>
<B>Action is necessary because the damage caused by climate change may be 
catastrophic and irreversible.</B> Estimates of the probable damage from climate 
change vary widely, from moderate to overwhelming. However, if the earth’s surface 
warms by several degrees centigrade over the next 100 years as predicted, it seems clear 
that millions of people would become vulnerable to the effects of famine, drought, coastal 
flooding, and more. Nasty surprises, such as changes in certain ocean currents that 
strongly influence regional weather patterns, could not be ruled out. Once such disasters 
started to occur, it would take at least several generations before measures to reverse 
climate change could have significant results. The money spent on taking action now could 
be viewed as an insurance premium for protection against a hard-to-measure but 
potentially devastating risk.<P>
<B>The first cuts in greenhouse gas emissions would be relatively cheap.</B> Some 
10% of emissions could be eliminated by raising industrial and energy efficiency and by 
removing counter-productive policies, such as subsidies for clearing forests. The longer 
such steps are delayed, the more expensive it will become to achieve identical results with 
future policies. Furthermore, by the time these early reductions are completed and more 
expensive decisions must be made, the scientific evidence concerning climate change 
should be clearer.<P>
<B>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions would have additional benefits unrelated to 
climate change. </B>Fuel efficiency would save money. Lower emissions of pollutants 
from factories and automobiles would improve air quality in urban centres and reduce acid 
rain. Putting a stop to deforestation would reduce soil erosion, offer aesthetic and 
economic benefits, and protect biodiversity and subsistence forest dwellers. One study 
suggested that while a hypothetical carbon tax (fact sheet 230) might cost Norway 2.75% 
of its GNP in the year 2010, 70% of that cost would be recouped through such 
non-climate benefits.1<P>
