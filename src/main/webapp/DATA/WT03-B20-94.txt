<HR>
     Basic information on radionuclide release at the active stage 
of the accident has been presented in  
<A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>.   
In  this  work the  data  on  the  amount  and  composition   of    
the   released radionuclides were obtained by calculations, using  
the  models  of transfer of contaminants in the atmosphere.  
The initial information for calculations was: 
<UL> 
<LI> the results of investigations of a small number of  aerosol 
samples taken over the accidental unit; 
<LI> the data of aerial gamma monitoring of the  region  of  the 
Chernobyl NPP; 
<LI> the results of analysis of samples of  depositions  in  the 
near zone; 
<LI> the data on weather conditions in the regions of transport 
of contaminated air masses. 
</UL> 
<P> 
     The process of release of  radioactive  substances  from  the 
accidental reactor was relatively long and  consisted  of  several 
stages, which differed in radionuclide composition  and  intensity 
<A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14]</A>.  
<UL> 
<LI><B><A HREF = "rfstage.html">First stage</A></B>. 
<LI><B><A HREF = "rsstage.html">Second stage</A></B>. 
<LI><B><A HREF = "rtstage.html">Third stage</A></B>. 
<LI><B><A HREF = "rfostage.html">Fourth stage</A></B>. 
</UL> 
Obviously, the release of radioactive noble gases during the 
accident  was  about  100%  (we  have  met  no  discrepancies   in 
estimation of this value). 
<P> 
     Since the moment of the accident <A HREF = "hrel.gif">a high-power stream  of  hot 
air</A> was formed, which carried out radioactive substances from  the 
reactor ruins into the atmosphere. Its power  was  maximal  during 
the first 2-3 days. The height of the stream, as it was  indicated 
in <A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>, reached more than 1200 m on 27 April,
 1986, 30 km  to  the 
north-west from the Chernobyl NPP: 
<P><IMG SRC  = "cloud3.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE> North-west shadow in progress.
<P> 
The level of radiation  in  the 
stream was about 1 mR/h at the height of 1200 m. In the  following 
days the stream  height  did  not  exceed  200-400  m,  as  it  is 
indicated in [14]. The level of radiation in  the  stream  at  the 
distance of 5-10 km and the height of 200 m was about 1 R/h on  27 
April, and 0.5 R/h on 28 April. 
<P> 
     This estimation of the release height is true 
only for the relatively heavy fuel  component.  According  to  the 
data of <A HREF = "sources.html"#9>[9]</A>, iodine and cesium radioisotopes  were  found  at  the 
heights of 6-9 km. The appearance  of  the  iodine-131  traces  in 
Japan and the USA not later 5 May indicates the same fact. 
<P> 
     The qualitative picture  of  the  release  briefly  presented 
above has not been subjected in its main  details  to  changes  in 
subsequent investigations (see, for instance, <A HREF = "sources.html#2">[2 and  14]</A>),  where 
the data on the initial amount of radionuclides in the reactor and 
the values of the release components were made more accurate. Only 
the statement about termination of significant releases in 10 days 
after the accident (see <A HREF = "rnucrel2.html">"New data on radioactive release"</A>) raises doubts. 
<P> 
     The total amount of the radionuclides  released  out  of  the 
bounds of the Chernobyl NPP area is   50 MCi as  of  6  May  1986, 
with the error of 50% (excluding radioactive gases and  fuel)  and 
the fuel component estimated in <A HREF = "sources.html">[1, 2]</A> as 3.5%-0.5%  of  the  fuel 
inventory in the core  of  the  reactor  with  accuracy  -50%,  is 
confirmed by subsequent investigations <A HREF = "sources.html">[4, 5]</A>. The  estimation  of 
the fuel release less than 1% presented in the USA work  <A HREF = "sources.html#16">[16]</A>  can 
be explained by the  fact  that  its  authors  used  the  data  on 
fallouts and concentration of radionuclides in the air in the  far 
zone, whereas the main part of the fuel component of  the  release 
is concentrated inside the 30-km zone. 
<P> 
<A HREF = "zone.gif"><IMG SRC  = "zonesm.gif" ALIGN=MIDDLE> Pu spot inside 30-km zone(press here for more details).</A><P> 
     Main disagreements belong to the estimation of the release of 
iodine and cesium isotopes. The estimation of Cs-137 release  made 
in <A HREF = "sources.html"[1]</A> as 13% was the  subject  of  discussion  in  <A HREF = "sources.html">[1-4,  6,  14, 16-18]</A>, and subsequently increased up to 25 % in <A HREF = "sources.html#4">[4]</A>, over 25%  in 
<A HREF = "sources.html#17">[17]</A>, 33%  -  13%  in  <A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14]</A>,  33%  -  10%  in  <A HREF = "sources.html#2">[2]</A>  bases  on  the 
measurement of  Cs-137  in  fuel  masses  inside  the  containment 
structure (<A HREF = "sarclast.gif">"sarcophagus"</A>) of unit 4, up to 40%  according  to  the 
data of <A HREF = "sources.html#16">[16]</A> based on the data of global fallouts, and reached 60% 
in <A HREF = "sources.html#6">[6]</A>. The authors consider the most  convincing  the  estimation 
presented in <A HREF = "sources.html#2">[2]</A>: 33% - 10%, or  (2.3-0.7)  MCi,  which  coincides 
with the estimation in <A HREF = "sources.html#14">[14, 16]</A>. More detailed  investigations  of 
fuel masses inside the containment structure could  possibly  give 
more accurate information on this subject. 
<P> 
     Still more ambiguous is the  estimation  of  the  release  of 
iodine radioisotopes, first of  all  of  I-131,  which  has  great 
practical importance for reconstruction of the doses to thyroid in 
population.  Unfortunately,  the  measurements  on  26  April  are 
absent, and the first release  of  the  short-lived  radionuclides 
(not   only   of   iodine-131,   but   also   of    tellurium-132, 
molybdenum-99,etc.) is not outlined completely. Besides, there  is 
a circumstance unfavorable for measurements, the release of iodine 
partly in  the  aerosol  and  partly  in  the  gaseous  form.   The 
measurement  of  the  gaseous  iodine  requires  special   complex 
technique. Besides, the relation of the  forms  noticeably  varied 
with time during  the  active  phase  of  the  accident  <A HREF = "sources.html#7">[7]</A>.  The 
approximate constancy of the ratio  of  activities  of  I-131  and 
Cs-137 in fallouts observed in the majority of European  countries 
gives an opportunity to estimate iodine  depositions  with  cesium 
maps. In particular, such estimation was performed in <A HREF = "sources.html#17">[17]</A>,  where 
the conclusion was made that the iodine release was least 45%.  In 
different works the iodine release is estimated from  20%  to  60% 
<A HREF = "sources.html#3">[3-5, 16, 17]</A>, up to 80% in <A HREF = "sources.html#6">[6]</A>. 
<P> 
 To  our  opinion,  the  most  realistic  is  the  estimation   of 
iodine-131 release equal to 50-60% of its content in the  reactor, 
or 40-50 MCi as of 26 April 1986. Accounting for radioactive decay 
in the reactor in the period of active release,  this  corresponds 
to total activity of 30-35 MCi released  into  the  atmosphere  in 
different days. According to the general estimation, about 80%  of 
iodine came out from the reactor in the gaseous form.

     Table presents numerical data on the release  of  different 
radionuclides  from  the  destroyed  reactor.  The  first   column 
presents the estimations from the report by  academician  Legasov 
in 1986 <A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A> decay-corrected to 26  April  1986  <A HREF = "sources.html#18">[18]</A>.  The  second 
column gives the estimations from the work by P.H.Gudiksen  et.al. 
<A HREF = "sources.html#16">[16]</A> decay-corrected to 26 April 1986. The  third  column  is  the 
summary of the most reliable (as to the expert evaluation  of  the 
authors) data  on  the  release.  The  data  on  the  radionuclide 
inventory in the reactor are taken in accordance with <A HREF = "sources.html#12">[12, 18]</A>. 
<P> 
     Notice that the release of iodine-131, as well as  of  cesium 
radioisotopes, was evidently underestimated according to the results 
of <A HREF = "sources.html">[1, 18]</A>. The release of iodine-131 was  assumed  equal  to  the 
middle  (45  MCi)  of  the  estimated  interval  40-50  MCi.   The 
estimation of the cesium release as 33%, or 2.3 MCi, is  based  on 
the amount of cesium-137 in the destroyed reactor, which coincides 
with its global distribution in the atmosphere and  deposition  on 
surface. The Cs-134 release was  assumed  equal  to  0.53  of  the 
Cs-137 release (see section 3.2), i.e., 1.2 MCi. The data  on  the 
tellurium release have no discrepancies.  Strong  connection  with 
the <A HREF = "coreinv.html">fuel matrix</A> is assumed for the rest of radionuclides, at least 
during the explosion, and their release is calculated as  3.5%  of 
the amount accumulated in the core.
