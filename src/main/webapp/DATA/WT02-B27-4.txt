<HR NOSHADE>

When you meet Michael Smith on an ordinary day he is likely to be
wearing a shabby old sweater and trousers that long ago should have
been sent to a charity like the Salvation Army. The Nobel laureate has
certainly not allowed success to go to his head--or his wardrobe. Maybe
it's because of his working class origins in the Northern town of Blackpool,
England. Shortly after the Nobel announcement in October 1993, he said
to his administrator Darlene Crowe, "If you ever see my behaviour
start to change and I get a swelled head with all this attention, I
want you to give me a good swift kick."

<P>

Darlene calls her boss "Mike". She remembers only one occasion on which
she had to "kick" him. Mostly, he behaved himself. Smith didn't even
keep the half million dollar Nobel prize money. He gave half of it to
researchers working on the genetics of schizophrenia, a widespread
mental disorder for which research money is scarce. The other
half he gave to Science World BC and to the Society for Canadian Women
in Science and Technology. As if that was not generous enough, Smith
invited 12 colleagues to come to Stockholm with him, all expenses paid
by Smith, to share in the glory of the Nobel awards ceremony. He took
all his research assistants, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate
students who had done the experiments leading to the prize. 

<P>

Maybe it's because Smith could afford it. He made a small fortune in
1988 when he sold his share of Zymogenetics Inc., a Seattle-based
biotechnology company that he co-founded in 1981. Smith's Nobel
prize-winning genetic engineering techniques were used by Zymogenetics to
develop a strain of yeast implanted with the human gene for insulin.
Together with the drug giant, Novo-Nordisk, they commercialized a better
process for the production of human insulin using yeast.
<P>

Even then, Smith was generous with his profits. He bought a cabin
in Whistler, a ski resort near Vancouver. He furnished it, and said 
it was for the use of his coworkers,
staff, colleagues, friends and children. A sign up sheet hangs
in his laboratory where people simply write in which weeks they'd like
to use the cabin.
<P>
Smith didn't become successful by accident. He's a very hard worker,
some say a workaholic. His office is of medium size, modestly furnished
with a cluttered, lived-in look. He has a beautiful picture-window view
looking out onto the treed UBC campus and the coast mountains in the
distance. One wall of the office is made of shallow shelves jammed full
of medals, awards and plaques for prizes he has won. Obviously proud
of his accomplishments, Smith doesn't boast about them. 

<P>

Things did not always come easy for Smith. 
When he first submitted his great discovery
for publication in Cell, a leading academic journal, it was rejected.
The editors said that, "it was not of general interest,"
but he never stopped trying, and above all, he was always prepared to
change directions and do what he calls, "follow-your-nose research."

<P>

The original idea for site-directed mutagenesis came to Smith while in 
discussion with an American scientist named Clyde Hutchison over coffee
at a Cambridge, England research lab. Smith was spending a year's
sabbatical in 1976 at Fred Sanger's Lab, which was in the famous institute
where DNA was first explained by Watson and Crick. Smith had gone there
to learn how to sequence genes--how to
determine the order of the thousands of links that make up a chain of
DNA. He was explaining to Hutchison in the cafeteria how they were
making short chains of nucleotides--the chain links in DNA--for use in
separation and purification of DNA fragments. Their technique was based
on the natural affinity of one DNA chain to link up with its mirror 
image (see The Science below). It didn't take much of a leap to realize
the same technique might be used to induce mutations, but it meant
changing directions again, and not for the first time. It took Smith
and his team several years to perfect the method. In the process
they had to learn new techniques, and develop new procedures.

<P>

<B>History</B><BR>

Michael Smith was born into a working-class family in Blackpool,
England. His mother and father both had to work from their early teens
onward, she in the holiday boarding house of her mother and he in his
father's market garden. In those days, English working-class school
children had to take an exam called the "Eleven-Plus" when they were
eleven years old to see if they would go on to a private school (and
probably university) or just continue in the public school system where
they would learn a trade and finish at the age of 16. Smith did very
well in his Eleven Plus and was offered a scholarship to a local
private school called Arnold School, but he didn't want to go because
the students there were considered snobs and he thought his friends would
make fun of him. Luckily, his mother insisted that he go. 

<P>
It was not a very happy time in Smith's life. He lost most of his old friends. He
had homework to do every night and they didn't. He did not like the food at
Arnold School but was forced to eat it by strict teachers. He was not very good
at sports which were very important in English private schools. He had
few friends at the new school. His big front teeth stuck out
so he was teased by his schoolmates. Fortunately he was
sent to a dentist to see about his overbite and the dentist introduced him
to the world of Boy Scouts, where he made friends and learned about
camping and the outdoors. It's partly because of this love of nature
and camping that Smith decided to settle in Vancouver, Canada.

<P>

Smith was 7 when World War II broke out, and though they lived pretty
far North in England, he does remember one time when German bombs fell on
either side of their house, just barely missing him and his brother, Robin.
His mom and dad were not home.
<P> 
Smith did not go to a prestigious English University like Oxford, but
did get into the honours chemistry program at Manchester University. He
hoped to get a first class Bachelor of Science degree, but alas, he
was a B student. He was very disappointed, but he still got a state
scholarship and managed to complete a PhD.
<P>
Smith wanted to do post-doctorate research on the West coast of the USA,
and he wrote to many universities, but was rejected by them all. Then
in 1956 he heard of a young scientist in Vancouver, Canada, Gobind
Khorana, who had a position available to work on biologically important
molecules. This was not the chemistry in which he had
been trained, and it was much harder, but he went to Vancouver anyway.
It turned out to be a very good decision, because in Khorana's lab
Smith began learning the chemistry that would lead to the Nobel Prize.
Khorana himself received a Nobel Prize in 1968 for work on the genetic
code--work that Smith was involved in during the late 50s at
UBC. (Smith moved with Khorana's group to Wisconsin in the USA in 1960,
but in 1961 he moved back to Vancouver).
<P>
For years Smith worked at the Fisheries Research Board of Canada
Laboratory in Vancouver, and published many papers about crabs, salmon,
and marine mollusks, but he managed to sustain his research in DNA
chemistry with outside grants. The lab was located on the UBC campus,
and because he was collaborating so much with professors in
biochemistry and medicine, in 1966 he was appointed a UBC professor
of biochemistry in the Faculty of Medicine where he remains today.

Molecular Biology is the study of biological systems at the level of
individual chemicals and molecules. Michael Smith is an expert on the
DNA molecule and the smaller molecules the body uses to make DNA--the
molecule that makes up your genes, the instructions
required to create every part of an organism. DNA is a large molecule
that is like a twisting chain. Actually it is two chains twisted
together.
<P>
<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/css/gcs/graphics/smith_science.gif>

<P>

1. A small portion of a long DNA molecule showing the backbone (in light
gray) made of deoxyribose--a type of sugar. The backbone sugar segments
are all the same but they can have one of 4 different basic groups, 
Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine. Adenine on one
sugar chain always matches up with Thymine on the other. Similarly
Cytosine always matches up with Guanine. In this way one chain of DNA
is a mirror image of the other. In real DNA the chain would continue up
for thousands of nucleic acids and down for thousands, too.

<P>

2. The nucleotide Guanine. The phosphate sugar is on the left and the
basic group is on the right. Note the two hydrogen atoms and one
oxygen atom poking out on the extreme right that form the bond with
Cytosine on the sister chain.

<P>

3. Smith's idea for which he won the Nobel prize was to slip a
synthetic stretch of nucleotides--called an oligonucleotide--into some
DNA on one side. Synthetic means it was created in a test-tube, not by
nature. The synthetic segment is added to normal DNA using standard
chemicals for breaking and reforming DNA chains. But there is one thing
wrong with the synthetic oligonucleotide: it has an Adenine where there
should be a Guanine. This is done on purpose to create a mutation. The
4 nucleotides below and above the Adenine act as a kind of address that
causes this stretch on DNA to match up to a particular part of a long
DNA strand. (In humans you need only 17 nucleotides to define a unique
match somewhere among our 100,000 genes.)

<P>

4. When this new altered DNA is put back into an organism, say a
bacterium, and it divides in the normal process of growth and
reproduction, one half of the DNA will recombine normally and you will
get a correct copy of the original gene--a normal bacterium. The other
side with the synthetic oligonucleotide will create a mutation because
a Thymine is where there should be a Cytosine. The resulting mutant
bacterium might have some new appearance or function that it never had
before.

<P>

5. Three kinds of site specific mutations are possible with Smith's
technique: 1. Substitution of one nucleotide for another as shown here,
2. Deletion of a nucleotide, and 3. Addition of an extra nucleotide.
Before Smith's technique there was no way to create specific mutations.
You had to expose a bunch of organisms to radiation or chemicals that
would create all sorts of mutants, then you had to select the one that
you wanted. It was all by random chance.


<HR NOSHADE>

<HR NOSHADE>

Soon the total sequence of the DNA in all the genes for a human being will
be known--the human genome. Smith believes this will change how people do 
biology research. Those genes have the code or "recipe" for each of the
100,000 proteins that make up a human being, but we currently only know of
about 5,000. The hard part will be discovering what part of the human genome
does what, picking out what is crucial, discriminating the important bits
of DNA from all the rest.
