WEEKLY ADVISER: THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF THE FAMILY-RUN BANK

By Paul Nadlers
The family-owned and family-run bank seems like the ultimate in
community banking.
   "I bank at Smith Bank" or "I've been banking with the Jones family all
my life, and so did my father" are typical comments in many communities
where a grandfather or even great-grandfather started a bank and son after
son took up the mantle.
   But all is not sweetness and light in the family bank tradition, even
though it has great deal to offer.
   One problem is that people in town expect the banker to always say yes.
"Your father served my father," is the line. "How can you turn me down
now?"
   I remember talking to a small group in one town where the banker was
bragging about his family tradition. One customer piped up that he too had
a family banking tradition. "I am a third-generation check kiter."
   A more serious question for a family bank, though, is whether the new
generation wants to work at it.
   When I was an undergraduate, a speaker at college told us: "Half of you
in this room are Republicans because your fathers are Republicans. And half
of you are Democrats because your fathers are Republicans."
   Among my proudest achievement as a teacher has been talking students out
of being accountants or lawyers or bankers just because their fathers were.
   "It's awful," parents tell me. "My son became a chef (or whatever)
instead of going into banking."
   "Is he happy?" I ask.
   "Absolutely."
   "Then why are you moaning?" I say. "You should be cheering."
   When it is a family business, however, taking a different path is harder
to do - even if your heart isn't in becoming a bank president.
   And following in your father's footsteps is also not easy. I know.
   My father was one of the most famous bank economists of his day. Every
time I did something right, people would say, "What do you expect from
Marcus Nadler's son, with all the help he has received." And when things
went wrong, the comment would be, "Wow, you let your father down."
   Maybe it's the problem of following your dad that has made so many
second- and third-generation bankers take chances to show their
independence - chances that in a number of cases have seriously damaged
their banks, or killed them.
   But what if you basically inherit a bank presidency and really want the
job? How do you learn to do it well?
   There are three basic training grounds, and each has its drawbacks:
   Your own bank. Being trained there limits the opportunities for growth.
   All too often a young heir apparent is trained by putting him under
Gridley, a greybeard with 40 years' experience. Unfortunately, many
Gridleys actually have one year's experience 40 times. Under them the new
banker learns the adage "never do something the first time."
   Being trained by your dad the CEO has similar pitfalls.
   Money-center banks. Heirs apparent used to have this second route
available - working for the family bank's correspondent bank. The money-
center would be delighted to take the CEO's son aboard for several years
and teach him banking. It knew this would cement the relationship with the
family bank, insuring correspondent business for years ahead.
   But many money-centers are now giving up correspondent business, because
the balances have been reduced sharply now that respondents' required
reserves must be kept with the Fed. As a result, correspondent balances
must come from money that otherwise could be lent or invested.
   Banker schools. There are complaints that they treat all students alike.
   What's wrong with that? The gripe is that those who'll wind up running
their family banks don't get the instruction and insight they'll need -
that instead they learn what a lending officer in a larger regional needs
to know, or a branch manager of a major bank.
   This, some critics say, is why the major banking schools are not drawing
the students they used to. Ignoring their own marketing courses, the
schools fail to segment the markets for their programs.
   Despite these problems, the family-run bank is not dead. But like other
traditions that have made community banking unique, it is becoming less of
a force. And the urge to merge is only one reason.
   Mr. Nadler is a contributing editor of the American Banker and professor
of finance at Rutgers University Graduate School of Management.

EYE ON THE STATES: MASS. TRADE GROUP REVIVES WITH MISSION TO SWAP IDEAS

By JONATHAN D. EPSTEIN
A Massachusetts bank trade group is waking up from a long hibernation,
abandoning old lobbying efforts in favor of helping its independent bank
members boost their bottom lines through cooperative efforts.
   After several years of inactivity, and hardly any meetings, the
Massachusetts Independent Bankers Association is seeking to draw community
banks together to exchange policies and ideas related to lending, human
resources, and marketing.
   In particular, officials want the association to establish common credit
criteria to make loan participations among members easier, without having
to work with a larger bank that "might look to take the customer away,"
said association president Jim D. Carey, president of Slade's Ferry Bank,
Somerville.
   "We felt that independent commercial banks have a few common interests,"
Mr. Carey said. "There are a few things that we can do together to help our
bottom line."
   By sharing policies and practices relating to employee benefits and
marketing, the banks will help those smaller members who can't afford to
hire full-time staffs or pay advertising agencies to develop campaigns, he
explained.
   Mr. Carey said the wave of consolidation sweeping the industry has only
strengthened the belief among community bankers that they will survive and
prosper because they can better serve customers. But "I think we need to
help each other with the burden of regulation and the management of bottom
lines."
   "It's going to be much more one on one, trying to assist each other and
managing our institutions in the marketplace to preserve our independence
and share our common management concerns and solutions so that we don't end
up fading out of existence," he said.
   In the past, the group, which was formed about 25 years ago and is an
affiliate of the Independent Bankers Association of America, focused its
attention on influencing banking legislation on Beacon Hill in Boston and
on Capitol Hill in Washington. But as the group's members were gobbled up
by mergers, its influence and activity dropped off.
   Last April, in response to a push from IBAA officials to restart the
group, officials from about 13 banks met to discuss the organization's
future.
   Richard D. Driscoll, president of the Massachusetts Bankers Association,
said he was unaware of the Massachusetts Independent Bankers' recent
activities.
   "If there is a need for one more group, they'll get members," he said.
"But if banks don't feel there's a need, they won't join."
   He added that the Massachusetts Bankers has added about 15 new small-
bank members in the last two years. In fact, he said, every commercial bank
in Massachusetts is an active member except Mr. Carey's bank.
   Still, Mr. Carey said the Massachusetts Independent members concluded
that the group should no longer try to provide lobbying or educational
services to its members anymore, because the Massachusetts Bankers
Association and other organizations already filled that need better than
the independent bankers group could.
   "Their expertise is in the legislative efforts and the educational
efforts, and we believe you should render to Caesar what is Caesar's," Mr.
Carey said. "They're every good at what they do, and our thrust is a little
different."
   Mr. Carey said the group has stressed to the Massachusetts Bankers
Association that it's not trying to compete. Already the association
includes 20 banks, with 13 other potential members, all with less than $250
million in assets.
   Mr. Carey said officials haven't ruled out cosponsoring a seminar with a
larger organization, but "that's not our thrust. There are organizations
that do that well."

SBA SAYS 1ST NATIONAL LEADS IN NEW ENGLAND

HARTFORD, Conn.
The Small Business Administration ranked First
National Bank of New England the largest lender of SBA-guaranteed
commercial loans under its flagship 7(a) program in New England.
   The agency, in releasing its 1995 fiscal year figures, shows First
National Bank of New England as the region's largest 7(a) lender by a wide
margin. First National Bank originated 85 loans during the year, for a
total of $40.7 million. Based on dollar volume, the bank, which has its
corporate headquarters in Hartford, Conn., ranks sixth in the nation. It is
the leader in New England for the second consecutive year.
   "Most of our clients are privately owned manufacturers and distributors
who use the SBA-guaranteed loans to invest in equipment, facilities, or
marketing programs that make them more globally competitive, " said Brian
J. Charlebois, executive vice president and head of commercial banking.
   Only two other New England-based banks ranked in the top 50 on the SBA's
1995 list. The bank's SBA loan volume, for instance, was five times that of
Bank of Boston, which was ranked 43d. First New Hampshire Bank was ranked
23.

AGRICULTURE: FARM LENDERS HARVESTED A DECENT CROP IN '95

By BARBARA F. BRONSTIEN
Last year was a fairly good one for farm lenders.
   The year "turned out to be generally quite good for American
agriculture," said Marvin Duncan, chairman of the agricultural economics
department at North Dakota State University, Fargo. "Prices are ... high
enough so there will essentially be no government subsidies in the form of
deficiency payments."
   But in agriculture, you take the bad with the good. Farmers and lenders
saw individual areas hit with weather- and disease-related woes and
industry-specific troubles, such as the cattle industry's price dip.
   And so, this year farm bankers will have a keen eye on the
struggling areas such as the cattle industry. And they await with mixed
feelings word on the 1995 farm bill from Washington.
   Cattle producers face additional years of low prices as supply exceeds
demand and producers begin selling off breeder animals to ultimately reduce
supply. However, this liquidation initially will increase the supply even
further.
   "It's going to be a pretty tough time in '96, '97 for the cattle
sector," said Bill Helming, an agricultural consultant in Olathe, Kan.
"We've got the prices below the cost of production already, and we haven't
even started liquidation. That's going to add insult to injury."
   The dairy industry also has not seen price increases in several years,
said Alec Bridges, president and chief executive of $240 million-asset
Sulphur Springs (Tex.) State Bank, who has numerous dairy customers.
   "The performance is not as good as it's been," Mr. Bridges said. "We're
not having any real horror stories. We had tightened our underwriting
standards and made sure that they performed to the point that we could go
with them when things weren't as good."
   On the other hand, grain prices rose this year, a result of a wet spring
and early frost that brought a "short" crop, reducing supply.
   "Most farmers who are producing and selling grain have less grain to
sell, but they're going to have the opportunity to sell it for a higher
price," Mr. Helming said.
   If he were a lender, he said, he'd be encouraging his customers "to take
advantage of these higher prices and sell into it. Farmers typically don't
sell when the market's going up; they sell when the market's low. I know it
doesn't sound logical, but that's the way it's been done for 50 years."
   Mr. Helming said that although the tendency of farmers to sell at the
worst time has improved - more farmers are using better farm marketing
techniques to reduce the risk of price fluctuations - it's still a problem.
   "When the market's going up, they think it's going to go higher," he
said. "When the market's going down, they're reluctant to sell. And by the
time they sell, it's a lot lower."
   The higher prices also made the industry less anxious over the yet-to-
be-determined government farm program, said Larry Knutson, president of
State Bank of Blomkest, Minn., and current president of the Upper Midwest
Agricultural Credit Council.
   "We're cautiously optimistic about next year," Mr. Knutson said.
"Production looks like it's going to be a pretty good year."
   Still, farmers and lenders alike continue to wait for the 1995 Farm Bill
to learn what government policy will be on farm subsidies.
   "There was lots of discussion about the Farm Bill, and we still don't
have it," said Philip M. Burns, president of Farmers and Merchants National
Bank, West Point, Neb., and the current chairman of the American Bankers
Association's agriculture lenders committee.
   Practically speaking, Congress should implement a Farm Bill in January
or February so farmers - and lenders - can organize their 1996 planting,
Mr. Helming said. "There are a lot of decisions to be made in planting as
you get into the spring," he said.
   The consensus is that government subsidies to farmers will be
diminished, whatever the ultimate bill.
   Mr. Helming expects the legislation to take the form of the Freedom to
Farm Act. "That's what bankers ought to plan for, which means their
customers are going to end up being totally dependent on the real-world
supply and-demand forces in the marketplace, as opposed to the safety net
of the government."
   This development has led farm bankers, already a conservative bunch, to
become more cautious, said Mr. Duncan of North Dakota State.
   "More risk is going to be placed on the shoulders of the farmer than in
the past," he said. "They will want to have a full understanding of the
risk management techniques that their customers are going to be pursuing.
The bottom line for the next one to five years is substantially greater
uncertainty in agriculture."

COLORADO BANKERS FIGHTING AN EXPANSION IN DENVER

By JAMES B. ARNDORFER
Colorado bankers are going to the courts to block a credit union
expansion.
   The Colorado Bankers Association is suing the state banking agency for
permitting $84.4 million-asset Gates Credit Union to expand its membership
base to include the southern metropolitan area of Denver - nearly 300,000
people.
   Craig Umbaugh, a lawyer representing the bank trade group, said the
expansion runs roughshod over state laws that restrict community expansions
to no more than 25,000 or to the regulator's discretion.
   "The Department of Financial Institutions has exceeded the clear
language of the statute," Mr. Umbaugh said. "I think this expansion has
wiped away half the statute."
   The association filed suit last Thursday against the Colorado
Financial Services Board, which has some oversight over the Division of
Financial Services. The five-member board - which includes three credit
union executives - approved the Gates expansion on Nov. 28 despite bankers'
objections at a public hearing.
   "It's not unexpected," said David L. Paul, commissioner of the division.
"They had been fairly forthright with our legal counsel that that's where
they were headed."
   Steve Newell, chairman of the Financial Services Board and president of
Colorado State Employees Credit Union, said the board considered all the
evidence, including that submitted by bankers in Gates' proposed expansion
area, when it approved the expansion.
   "The issue boiled down to whether or not the area of expansion was a
defined community," he said. "Overall, the board felt that the credit union
itself should be able to define what they consider to be a community."
   Gates Credit Union was seeking to expand out of uncertainty over the
future of its membership base, employees of Gates Rubber Co., said Carroll
Beach, president of the Colorado Credit Union League. The company had been
cutting employees for years.
   Bankers object to the size of the expansion, saying it does not
represent a distinct community, as required by statute.
   Donald Childears, president of the Colorado Bankers, said the credit
union's new membership base included several political districts and a
spectrum of income and demographic groups.
   Robert Wilson, a Denver lawyer who represents Gates Credit Union, would
not comment on the bankers' objections.
   "We're still in the process," he said.

SCORECARD: GOOD PERFORMANCE MARRED BY CRISES

By JAMES B. ARNDORFER
1995 was a banner year for credit unions, as capital levels hit
historic highs and delinquency continued a decade-long decline.
   Too bad nobody noticed. Instead, the industry busily set about making a
spectacle of itself for most of the year, beginning with the collapse of
$1.6 billion-asset Capital Corporate Federal Credit Union - Cap Corp - in
January.
   And both the industry and its regulator added to that debacle with flubs
throughout the year.
   Before 1995 was over the industry and the National Credit Union
Administration came under fire during congressional hearings. The Credit
Union National Association and the industry's top regulator were at each
others' throats. The chief executive of the industry's primary liquidity
facility resigned under a cloud and warned of looming problems.
   And to cap the year off, CUNA president Ralph Swoboda was deposed by the
trade group's board and state leagues.
   But in interviews with several industry leaders, the Cap Corp situation
emerged repeatedly as the single most important event of the year.
   It's not hard to see why.
   The largest failure in industry history triggered a series of
congressional hearings in which lawmakers - particularly in the Senate -
browbeat the industry for speculating in collateralized mortgage
obligations and ripped the NCUA for allowing it.
   "The most important thing was the closing of Cap Corp because it brought
credit unions into the light," said Charles O. Zuver, director of
governmental affairs for the Credit Union National Association. "It
generated legislation in the Senate and dissension in the credit union
movement."
   Chastened, the NCUA in April issued a regulation limiting corporate
investments that was so unpopular that the agency withdrew it even before
the comment period expired. The regulator has since been crafting a new
plan with the corporates that has the industry's liquidity centers
significantly more comfortable.
   "We're very encouraged" about the agency's willingness to cooperate,
said Richard M. Johnson, chief executive of Western Corporate Federal
Credit Union, San Dimas, Calif. "We think the regulator is going to be more
comfortable with us because he's taken a hard look at us."
   A rule affecting corporate investments alone would have a powerful
impact on the industry, but now the agency also is looking to tighten the
investment regulations of regular credit unions. Part of the inspiration
was the agency's finding that many institutions failed to understand the
risks of collateralized mortgage obligations - the same instruments that,
indirectly, led to the fall of Cap Corp - in their portfolios.
   Some industry experts have already slammed the proposal as requiring too
much paperwork.
   Mr. Swoboda, the former CUNA president, predicted that the struggle to
set new investment limits for the industry will be the pivotal event of
this year.
   "There'll be a stir over the investment regulations for natural person
credit unions and corporates," he said.
   The NCUA's decision to seize Cap Corp intensified the already hostile
relations between the NCUA and the industry - sparking a dissent on the
NCUA board from board member Robert Swan. Many in the industry -
particularly Cap Corp depositors that lost money - believed the regulator
could have saved the corporate if it had so desired.
   Acrimony was already present between segments of the industry and the
NCUA because of a rule approved in 1994 that would end trade group
management of corporates. The CUNA and the National Association of State
Credit Union Supervisors sued the agency in February in an effort to kill
the rule.
   But in September the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia ruled in the agency's favor. CUNA decided to drop its suit, but
state supervisors are pursuing their case against what most observers
consider to be heavy odds.
   At the same time, the agency and some industry figures have said they
think the federal court's decision might provide an opening for better
relations.
   "That's behind us now," said NCUA Chairman Norman E. D'Amours.
"Relations have been improving dramatically toward the latter part of the
year."
   That, however, remains to be seen: Pentagon Federal Credit Union, which
lost $1.1 million in Cap Corp, in October sued the NCUA to try to obtain
documents detailing the agency's reasons for imposing conservatorship on
Cap Corp.
   When credit unions weren't taking shots at the regulator, it seemed they
were fighting among themselves.
   Competition among credit unions became a big issue, with many
institutions protesting the proposed merger of the aggressive Patelco
Credit Union, San Francisco, and First Technology Federal Credit Union,
Beaverton, Ore. The complainants appeared to have the sympathy of Mr.
D'Amours, who has stressed the need for cooperation among credit unions,
and the merger was called off once it became clear NCUA wasn't going to let
it happen.
   And, the industry's largest trade group went through a meltdown during
the year, leading off with a management shakeout at the industry's main
liquidity center, U.S. Central Credit Union, which CUNA controlled.
   Early on, former U.S. Central president James R. Bell and blamed CUNA-
appointed board members for problems suffered by the company. A few months
later the Overland Park, Kan., institution was slapped with a low
performance rating by the NCUA.
   The industry's largest trade group was bruised on other fronts. Facing a
revolt from its affiliated state leagues, the association flip-flopped -
first supporting, then opposing - a Senate bill to strengthen NCUA's
oversight of state-chartered credit unions, a move that irked the bill's
sponsor, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   After this setback, Mr. Swoboda announced a sweeping review of the
association's structure, and the state leagues began gunning for him, trade
group sources said.
   To make matters worse at the trade group, losses blossomed at the Card
Services division of CUNA Service Group, a CUNA subsidiary.
   The board and other CUNA interests apparently believed that new blood
was the only cure for its problems. In October, it fired Mr. Swoboda, who,
before his departure, sacked some of his lieutenants.
   Even if credit unions continue to thrive this year, some of the ugly
events of 1995 are expected to work themselves to resolution - some
probably tortuously.
   "Credit unions have done very well; the confusion has all been in the
superstructure," said Ken Robinson, president of the National Association
of Federal Credit Unions.

VISA GUARANTEES CAR RENTALS AT PEAK TIMES

By MICKEY MEECE
At the behest of major car rental companies, Visa U.S.A. has introduced
a guaranteed reservation service for peak travel times.
   Visa said the service was available beginning Monday at participating
renters, including Hertz, Avis, National, and Budget. Cardholders who give
their account numbers at the time of their reservation can be assured that
a car will be awaiting them.
   To attack a growing "no show" problem, the rental companies will offer
guarantees when demand is high, mainly around holiday periods and special
events. The service will be similar to the hotel late-arrival guarantees
that customers can secure with credit card numbers.
   Visa, the first of the major card groups to introduce the car-rental
convenience, said users will no longer have to book cars at a number of
agencies to make sure they get one. By reducing the number of no-shows, the
rental companies should be able to manage their fleets better.
   As a byproduct of the guarantees, renters would penalize no-shows. Visa
no-shows would have to pay as much as a one-day rental fee if they do not
cancel reservations at least eight hours before the scheduled pickup.
   American Express Travel Related Services Co. is developing a similar
service, which a spokesman said could be available in the first quarter. A
no-show penalty of up to two days would kick in if a reservation was not
canceled 48 hours in advance.
   MasterCard International does not have a rental guarantee in the works,
a spokesman for that association said, because "we haven't seen a great
deal of interest in something like this."
   Visa said the service is voluntary. Cardholders can still reserve cars
in the customary manner.
A guarantee ensures that customers whose rental cars cannot be
delivered in an hour will be transported to their destinations, provided
with cars within eight hours, and given a free day's rental.
   Under American Express' proposed plan, if a rental company overbooked
and did not have the customer's vehicle, it would have to secure a
comparable one from another firm. If it could not do so, the rental agency
would provide an alternative vehicle at a rate no higher than the original
car and it would waive the first day's fee.
   American Express and Visa, which are first and second, respectively, in
car rental charge volume, said the rental companies came to them this year
seeking a solution to the no-show problem. No-show rates go as high as 70%
during peak periods.
   Not all rental agencies have committed to the guarantee service. A
spokeswoman for Alamo Car Rental said the company is evaluating it and has
not made a decision.
   Janet Maizner, a spokeswoman for Value Rent a Car, said, "We normally
take a wait-and-see attitude" to any new service that other agencies adopt.
   "Overall, it's a good move for the industry," Ms. Maizner said, adding
that it is hurt by "double and triple booking."
   Visa also is introducing an advance deposit program, allowing customers
to charge a deposit for rentals of up to 14 days. The association plans to
change its rules and procedures to permit the car rental deposits, similar
to an adjustment made in 1989 for hotels.

NEW NICHE: WISING UP DIRECT MARKETERS ABOUT WHO JUST WANTS TO BE LET
ALONE

By LISA FICKENSCHER
Marketers' obsession with buying and building massive customer data
bases has created a seemingly contradictory subspecialty - removing the
names of people who prefer not to be on mailing or telemarketing lists.
   It has become the law for direct marketers of everything from credit
cards to long-distance services to respect consumers' desires to be let
alone. But the advent of several companies in the "list suppression"
business indicates there is profit in it.
   "Honoring a customer's request is just good business," said Dick
Gallagher, president of the Signature Group, a company that offers credit
card enhancements, has added a service called "Do Not Solicit."
   Indeed, businesspeople are coming around to the view that privacy - and
the publicity they get from disseminating privacy protection policies - can
be a valuable commodity.
   "Privacy protection is going to become increasingly a service in America
far beyond list suppression," said Alan F. Westin, editor and publisher of
the newsletter Privacy and American Business.
   A handful of companies, including a list broker working on the World
Wide Web of the Internet, are apprising direct marketers of the names of
people who don't want to be solicited as sales prospects.
   The Signature Group's "Do Not Solicit" list helps companies comply with
the Telephone Consumer Act. A rule that the Federal Trade Commission added
to that legislation in August requires telemarketers to maintain lists of
people who don't want to be called again. The rule went into effect on
Sunday.
   The Schaumburg, Ill.-based Signature Group claims to be the only company
that electronically gathers such information and will compile a list for a
client marketer within 48 hours. That could significantly shorten the
process of removing names from a mailing list, which the group says
averages 45 days in the banking industry.
   Consumers get angry if they're called after asking for their names to be
struck off marketing lists, said Fanette Singer, a spokeswoman for
Signature Group. They want their names removed promptly, she said.
   The Direct Marketing Association has been providing a telephone
suppression service for its members since 1985. But Patricia Faley, vice
president of consumer affairs for the Washington-based trade group, pointed
out that its service is not required by law.
   About 600,000 consumers are on the association's telemarketing
suppression list, and three million are on a mail suppression list that was
begun in 1971. Consumers who appear on those lists are not solicited by a
variety of marketers; in contrast, the Signature Group provides its service
to one client company at a time.
   The Signature Group tracks people who are contacted by companies that,
for example, sell merchandise to bank customers. As the list provider, the
bank is legally responsible for compliance with the telemarketing law, even
though it may not be calling its customers directly.
   Another service, Buyer's Choice, has tapped into a different type of
consumer who is willing to be solicited for products and services but wants
to control who does the soliciting.
   "People are soon going to say, here are the news, the marketing, and the
people I want to reach me, and I don't want anyone else to reach me," said
Mr. Westin.
   Buyer's Choice, a division of the Polk Co. of Detroit, seems to be
responding to Mr. Westin's vision of the future. Polk, a provider of
demographic and lifestyle data, sends out consumer surveys asking people to
check off categories of products and services that interest them and those
that do not.
   Half a million people have completed the surveys. Keith Wardell, vice
president of Polk, expects the list to reach two million in a year.
   Buyers Choice has been gathering consumers' preferences for five years
but only recently have the surveys begun probing what kind of mail people
don't want to receive. About 20 major mailers, including catalogue
companies and travel clubs, are participating in a test of the service,
which Mr. Wardell said will be launched formally in the second quarter.
   Mr. Wardell estimates that people who complete the surveys will receive
about 20 pieces of mail annually from marketers subscribing to Buyer's
Choice, while 100 to 200 pieces of mail will be suppressed.
   The theory behind the service is that most people want to receive some
mail offers. The smallest opt-out category, for example, is women's
apparel, and the least popular offer are money market funds.
   To keep the list accurate, Buyer's Choice sends out its survey every six
months to people who have completed it.
   "Part of our intent is to stay in touch with those consumers," said Mr.
Wardell.
   Aurora, Ohio-based DM Group began compiling a list about four weeks ago
of people who don't want to be bothered by unwanted solicitations and
advertising, but its communications method is electronic mail.
   Robert Hicks, president of the five-year-old company, said he launched
the service because DM Group "came under a lot of heat when it came out
that we were managing E-mail lists."
   DM Group rents lists with about 250,000 names to marketers who want to
reach people via E-mail.
   But interest in the suppression list has been tepid so far, said Mr.
Hicks.
   Still, Mr. Westin believes the service is a significant development
because it recognizes that "E-mail deserves equal treatment with mail and
telephone preference (services), allowing people to opt out."
   "I think the DM Group has the right idea," added Mr. Westin. But he
suggested that companies put a question "up front" at their Web sites
giving surfers the opportunity to opt out of further unsolicited contact.

NATIONAL CITY UNIT BUYING 1ST DATA PAYMENT BUSINESS

By BETH PISKORA
National City Processing Co. has agreed to acquire the remittance
processing business of First Data Resources Inc.
   Under terms of the agreement, the Omaha-based card servicing unit will
outsource all of its clients' remittance activities exclusively to National
City. These functions include the opening, extracting, recording, and
posting of credit card payments with paper invoices.
   "This represents a 30% increase on our base of business," said Tony G.
Holcombe, chief executive officer of Louisville, Ky.-based National City
Processing, a subsidiary of $35 billion-asset National City Corp. of
Cleveland.
   "The additional transaction volume will bring us to 500 million
transactions annually" in the remittance processing area, added Mr.
Holcombe.
   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. It is expected to close
within 60 days.
   "With the acquisition, NPC will be the largest remittance processing
company in the United States," said David R. Zook, executive vice president
of corporate services for National City Processing.
   "This is an exciting opportunity for us to build upon our existing base
of remittance processing business while further enhancing the service
provided to clients of First Data Resources," he added.
   The agreement includes a long-term arrangement for First Data Resources
to continue to market the remittance business to its clients, with the
National City unit serving as processor.
   "First Data is not a major player in this area and we felt our clients
deserved the service and competitive advantage only a leader such as NPC
could provide," said a spokeswoman for First Data Corp., the Hackensack,
N.J.-based holding company for First Data Resources.
   The spokeswoman said the remittance deal with National City was not
precipitated by First Data's recent merger with First Financial Management
Corp.
   "We were simply trying to find the best solution for our clients, and
National City Processing is a true leader in remittance processing," she
said.
   First Data Resources will continue to offer card embossing, cobranding
and relational data base marketing services, home banking, smart card
services, and processing for credit, debit, and commercial cards.

SKEPTICISM GREETS TV PREDICTION THAT GLENFED WILL BE SOLD IN '96

By BARTON CROCKETT
Does CNBC commentator Dan Dorfman have the inside word on the next big
California thrift merger?
   He certainly gave that impression on his Dec. 21 "Dorfman Report" when
he singled out $15.9 billion-asset Glendale Federal Bank as a "sure-fire
takeover within the next 12 months."
   Mr. Dorfman said Glenfed chairman Stephen J. Trafton is rumored to be
"aggressively shopping the company at over 30 bucks a share." He also
quoted "takeover forecaster" Steve Kroll, managing director of Monness,
Crespi & Hardt, as saying a takeover of Glenfed is likely at $30 a share,
for a total price of $1.2 billion.
   Potential buyers were said to be California thrifts Great Western
Financial Corp., H.F. Ahmanson & Co., and Golden West Financial Corp.
   Even on the basis of fundamentals, Mr. Dorfman said, Glenfed would be a
good buy. He quoted Mr. Kroll as saying Glenfed was likely to win in 1996 a
$1.5 billion lawsuit against the government over regulatory goodwill - a
victory that would boost earnings $10 to $12 a share. Mr. Kroll reportedly
set a 12-month price target of $23 to $24 in the absence of a buyout or a
victory in the lawsuit.
   The report forced a half-hour halt in trading of Glenfed's stock and
spurred a $1 rise, to $17.87. This was its high for the year, and more than
twice its 52-week low of $8.50 late in 1994. .
   A Glendale Federal spokesman said the bank would not comment on the
"Dorfman Report" item, as a matter of policy. In recent months, Mr. Trafton
has said in interviews that Glenfed is open to a takeover but isn't
counting on one.
   Many stock analysts, thrift executives, and investment bankers were
highly skeptical of Mr. Dorfman's analysis.
   They noted that Mr. Dorfman was hardly unique in predicting that a big
California thrift is likely to be acquired in the next year. Most analysts
expect a wave of takeovers to commence as soon as buyers are convinced that
the California economy has rebounded and that California thrifts' balance
sheets are on solid ground.
   "The possibility of Glenfed being a takeover candidate is certainly not
brain surgery," said Gary Gordon, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. But he
and other sources said that the $30 price seems too
high unless Glenfed wins the goodwill lawsuit, which is far from certain.
   These observers also said they see no signs that a big merger involving
Glenfed is in the works. It is more likely, they said, that Mr. Trafton
will focus on improving the company's performance over the next year in
order to get a higher price in a subsequent takeover.
   "Our read is that Trafton is looking to aggressively add value to the
Glendale franchise and then sell," said Gregory A. Mitchell, senior vice
president of Hovde Financial Inc., an
investment banking firm. There is "no question" that Mr. Trafton will wait
at least a year to sell Glenfed, Mr. Mitchell added.
   "It doesn't feel like anything's imminent," said a senior thrift
executive with a big Glenfed rival, who asked not to be named.
   Many observers said they see much to recommend in-market mergers of
California thrifts, including a combination of Glenfed with any number of
other Southern California institutions. But they said they doubted
any of the three thrifts Mr. Trafton mentioned would be willing to pay the
kind of premium he'd be seeking in a takeover, or that Mr. Dorfman said
would be likely.

LOS ANGELES OFFICIALS URGE FED TO APPROVE FIRST BANK SYSTEM'S BID FOR
FIRST INTERSTATE

By BARTON CROCKETT
Richard J. Riordan is standing up for First Interstate again.
   The mayor of Los Angeles has teamed up with the president of his city
council to urge the Federal Reserve Board to reject Wells Fargo & Co.'s
application to acquire First Interstate Bancorp.
   The city "strongly opposes" Wells' bid for control of Los Angeles-based
First Interstate, Mr. Riordan and Council President John Ferraro wrote in a
letter dated Dec. 18.
   The letter, filed during the public comment period that ended late last
month, escalates the unusual level of political involvement in the battle
over First Interstate.
   Local politicians are typically silent about bank mergers, or else focus
their energies on trying to minimize office closings and layoffs.
   But Mr. Riordan and other prominent California politicians are openly
supporting the deal that First Interstate prefers - a merger with First
Bank System Inc. of Minneapolis.
   Speaking at an outdoor rally in November, Mr. Riordan professed "love"
for the chairmen of First Interstate and First Bank and said, "We look
forward to working with you for many, many years to come."
   The letter to the Fed details Mr. Riordan's reasons for opposing Wells'
bid while putting California's largest city in the position of trying to
influence federal policymakers.
   The Los Angeles officials said consumer banking services in California
would "be irreparably harmed" if San Francisco-based Wells bought First
Interstate. They said Wells' plans to close hundreds of traditional
branches and rely more on supermarket branches, automated teller machines,
and personal computers would benefit the well-to-do at the expense of the
poor.
   Lower-income communities "are chronically underserved by most retail
businesses, including supermarkets and banks," the letter said. "The
residents of these communities cannot afford expensive home computers and
often feel uncomfortable accessing ATMs in high-crime areas."
   The writers also warned that competition would suffer, as it was
"clearly diminished by the 1992 merger of BankAmerica Corp. and Security
Pacific Corp."
   "The proposed Wells Fargo/First Interstate consolidation
would have a similar impact," the city officials said.
   Raising concerns about broader economic impacts, Mr. Riordan and Mr.
Ferraro said Southern California would sustain "the vast majority" of the
7,000 to 10,000 job losses from a such a merger - an especially cruel blow
to Los Angeles County, where the 9% unemployment rate is already well above
the national average.
   Real estate markets would also suffer, they argued. First Interstate
owns or leases nearly 1.3 million square feet in four major buildings
downtown, an area where vacancy rates are high, at 20%. Office closures
"could completely destabilize (the Los Angeles) real estate market,
resulting in huge financial losses to owners and lenders throughout the
country," the letter said.
   Mr. Riordan and Mr. Ferraro also claimed that First Interstate would be
a better corporate citizen as part of First Bank than as part of Wells.
   "We have no doubt that Wells Fargo is prepared to make new commitments
to Los Angeles as part of its pending application," they said. "But we are
convinced that these commitments will inevitably fall well short of the
service and community involvement that Los Angeles enjoys today from First
Interstate Bank."

COMMENT: RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS NEED STRICT SALES GOALS

By CHARLES B. WENDEL
The title "corporate lender" has begun to disappear from the commercial
banking nomenclature in favor of the term "relationship manager."
   The relationship manager has significantly broader responsibility than
finding, underwriting, and monitoring loans. Ideally, he or she is a
coordinator of the sales process who evaluates customer needs, matches them
with the bank's products and services, identifies the most likely selling
opportunities, and brings in product specialists as needed.
   Unfortunately, this is largely a fantasy. It is still a distant goal
many banks have for relationship managers. Scratch the typical relationship
manager and what you find underneath is a traditional lender. The
relationship manager may sell cash management and other deposit services,
but it is rare to see the sale of products from other groups in the
organization.
   We estimate that among their best small and middle-market customers,
banks capture only a 5% to 10% "wallet share" of financial services
business. For example, no more that 60% of small-business owners who
maintain a commercial deposit account have their personal account at the
same bank.
   The gap between the intent of the relationship manager's job and its
reality needs to be addressed quickly and decisively. Among the reasons:
Many companies view lending as a commodity and not the basis for
differentiating one bank from another. But to achieve growth targets, banks
must emphasize wallet share over market share in many markets.
   Few senior managers would argue against the importance of building
customer relationships. Yet few banks are on the right path. There are four
major reasons:
   *Wrong messages. In a recent speech at a Robert Morris Associates
conference, Norwest Bank regional banking executive Scott Kisting
underscored the importance of communicating effectively with staff about
noncredit products. He said banks need to "celebrate" these sales to the
same extent they congratulate bankers for new loans.
   *Wrong or meaningless measurements. A banker at a well-respected
regional company told a story that is all too typical: He and his boss
would agree on annual goals for credit and noncredit product sales, but
during the year performance is never measured against those goals. And 12
months later, a new set of goals is agreed on, with the manager believing
that he is fulfilling his supervisory role.
   *Wrong products. Banks have not challenged themselves enough in
evaluating noncredit offerings from the customer's perspective. Are their
proprietary 401(k) investment options really as good as those offered by
nonbank competitors? Have cash management or custody products been
leapfrogged by others? Too many product developers are playing a game of
wishful thinking when it comes to product assessment.
   *Wrong people. Even after reengineering and downsizing, many banks
remain dominated by traditional "good old boys," not aggressive and
sophisticated financial consultants and salespeople. Upgrading relationship
manager staffing, either by improved training or replacing personnel,
remains critical to meeting market demands and exploiting opportunities.
   Ironically, within the small-business segment it is a nonbank that best
emphasizes the capturing of entire relationships. Merrill Lynch & Co.
focuses on meeting customer needs as opposed to a product demand, and its
people are rewarded for cutting across the organization to meet those
needs, whether personal, commercial and credit, investment, or risk-control
related. Through superior customer service, they are also skimming the
cream off the market.
   Bank managements must get beyond their delusions about relationship
managers by giving them a clear focus and setting priorities. In the near
term, a small centralized marketing unit can provide the expertise that
individual relationship managers may not possess. Management must rethink,
reduce, and in certain instances eliminate the relationship manager's
responsibility for maintenance, monitoring, and underwriting.
   Performance goals must be viewed as commitments. A higher level of
incentive compensation will widen the gap between the total compensation of
excellent and merely adequate performers. The alternative is to risk
becoming a provider of commodities and increasingly irrelevant to the
customer.
   Mr. Wendel is president of Financial Institutions Consulting, New York.

LENDERS ADJUSTING TO A NEW REALITY: TIGHTER BELTS

By SNIGDHA PRAKASH
As mortgage bankers prepare for a new refinancing wave, they are
struggling to digest the enduring effect of the last one - a strict new
emphasis on the bottom line.
   The signs were everywhere last year.
   In December, PNC Mortgage, Vernon Hills, Ill., announced it would no
longer buy loans from wholesale brokers, which wrote up to 20% of all PNC's
loans. The company said it was paying too much for low-quality loans, and
preferred to focus on writing loans through its own loan officers.
   Earlier in 1995, GE Capital Mortgage discontinued its retail lending
program, through which mostly small lenders had written GE loans. The
program had never generated large volumes, and reportedly did not make
enough profit to satisfy a more cost-conscious approach at GE.
   Some players chose to exit the mortgage business altogether. Notably,
Prudential Life Insurance Co.'s mortgage unit was put up for sale, and
Wells Fargo hired Norwest Mortgage Inc. to write its home loans.
   Industry executives say that a host of factors conspired to create a new
emphasis on cost cutting in a hitherto more relaxed business.
   The mortgage industry, which expanded to write a record $1 trillion of
loans in 1993, continues to be too large for current volumes - estimated at
$654 billion last year, and $765 billion this year. Fierce competition has
driven down prices, forcing a new focus on costs.
   And the influx of new capital, primarily from commercial banks, is
changing the economics of the industry. The largest lenders can afford to
buy, and constantly improve, expensive computer systems to originate and
service ever larger volumes of loans. At these companies, the costs of
originating and servicing each loan is consistently going down, and
everyone must strive to keep up.
   "The name of the game is keeping your costs down on everything, every
little operation - the cost of borrowing money, the cost of distribution to
the public," said David Loeb, chairman of Countrywide Credit Industries,
Pasadena, Calif.
   Within that context, Mr. Loeb and other executives said PNC's decision
to abandon the wholesale purchase of loans from mortgage brokers makes
eminent sense.
   "There's no money in wholesale lending. The brokers get everything and
then some," Mr. Loeb said. Countrywide is building up its direct business
with consumers, in order to decrease its reliance on third parties, he
said.
   Fees to mortgage brokers have climbed in the last few years, as lenders
jockey for volume by offering lucrative deals to brokers. Brokers these
days get not only all the origination fees but also a portion of the
servicing release premium, noted Saiyid T. Naqvi, chief executive of PNC
Mortgage.
   In addition, loans made by brokers tend to be refinanced more quickly,
he said. When rates go down, brokers are quick to resolicit their
customers. These and other factors led PNC to abandon the wholesale
business, Mr. Naqvi said.
   PNC's exit from wholesale lending is the latest sign that the mortgage
business is rationalizing, said Luke Hayden of Chemical Residential
Mortgage. In other words, players are adjusting their strategies to match
the real costs and profits of the mortgage business.
   So do the largest lenders, such as Countrywide, Chemical, and Norwest,
plan to follow PNC's lead?
   Not anytime soon. To exit wholesale lending or any other channel means
that you give up a whole segment of the market to your competitors, said
Mark Korell, group president of lender and investor services at Norwest
Mortgage Inc., Des Moines. That's something that a really large lender just
cannot afford to do.
   Still, Mr. Korell warned that if brokers charged too much, the pressure
to cut back on wholesale lending would mount.
   "Brokers have to compete with other forms of production, don't they? If
they take too much out of the equation, they're not going to be able to
stay in business," he said.
   "The moral of the story here is that the mortgage banking industry, like
every other industry, over time will act in a rational way," Mr. Korell
said. "Capital is movable. Not too many people are going to stay in a
business where they can't make adequate returns to their shareholders."

LAWMAKERS ASK PATIENCE FOR DEBTORS STRAPPED BY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

By KAREN TALLEY and HEATHER TIMMONS
Two key lawmakers have asked the federal housing agencies to persuade
loan servicers to cut some slack for furloughed government workers who miss
mortgage payments.
   In identical letters sent Dec. 28 to the chairmen of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach urged that the
workers be "protected from unintended consequences of the budget impasse."
   The same day, Rep. Rick Lazio, chairman of the banking panel's housing
subcommittee, urged Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros
to extend forbearance to borrowers whose mortgages are held in Ginnie Mae
pools.
   The lawmakers were responding to the second government shutdown in six
weeks. Tens of thousands of government workers have been left without
paychecks because Congress and the Clinton administration are logjammed
over the budget.
   Observers don't expect the budget impasse to drive up delinquency rates
dramatically. Even so, federal employees run the risk of missing payments,
forcing lenders to decide what actions, if any, to take.
   Lawmakers "send out similar letters for natural disasters, so I guess
they put this in the same category," said Brian Chappelle, staff vice
president for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
   In his letters, Rep. Leach asked Fannie and Freddie - formally the
Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. - to advise companies that collect and process mortgage loan payments
of options for dealing with delinquent borrowers.
   Specifically, he said, the agencies should instruct servicers to
consider borrowers' attitudes toward the debt and the reasons for missed
payments before declaring accounts in default.
   John Gibbons, a senior vice president at Freddie Mac, said that when it
received Rep. Leach's letter it was already notifying servicers that relief
is warranted under existing guidelines.
   A spokeswoman said Fannie Mae would decide this week how to proceed with
Rep. Leach's request. "We are very sympathetic to the situation and will
address the request," she said.
   Representatives from Ginnie Mae - a unit of HUD that is formally known
as the Government National Mortgage Association - could not be reached;
they are on furlough as part of the government shutdown.
   Lenders, meanwhile, said they have already snapped into action. GE
Capital Mortgage got hold of the lawmakers' letters on Dec. 28. It
immediately undertook a case-by-case review of defaults by federal
employees, a spokeswoman said.
   Capstead Mortgage Corp. said it is prepared to extend forbearance to
customers who ask for extra time to make payments, said Bill Ruduff,
executive vice president of servicing.
   Some banks have begun broader programs to help federal workers through
thin times. United Jersey Bank, for instance, is offering unsecured
personal loans to people furloughed from the Social Security
Administration.

GE THROWS IN THE TOWEL ON RETAIL ORIGINATIONS

By JULIANA RATNER
One of the most striking developments on the mortgage scene in 1995 was
the decision by GE Capital Mortgage Services to stop originating
residential loans directly to consumers.
   For years, the Raleigh, N.C., company's hallmark had been its presence
in virtually every aspect of the home loan business - insuring mortgages,
servicing them, originating mortgages through correspondent lenders, and
marketing loans directly to the public.
   Its retreat in August was seen as an acknowledgement that GE Capital,
despite its prowess in wholesale originations, had not grabbed enough
business to be a force in the retail business. In the first half of 1995,
retail loans accounted for only 7% of the company's originations, which
totaled just under $1 billion.
   "There are certain lines of business in which a company either has to
become a major player or leave," said Rolland Johannsen, president of
Furash & Co., a Washington-based consulting firm.
   Mr. Johannsen said that, unlike banks, finance companies such as GE
Capital don't have to worry that customers will leave if they can't choose
from a wide array of financial services. In short, GE Capital has the
luxury of picking the services it offers.
   "Because they don't have to consider mortgage originations in terms of a
customer relationship, it becomes a straight decision on how they will
allocate capital," Mr. Johannsen said.
   To be sure, GE Capital still casts a big shadow in the mortgage
industry. The company continues to originate home loans through brokers and
smaller lenders, and to sell mortgage insurance products. Also, it services
a portfolio of loans that totaled $110 billion last June 30, second only to
Norwest Mortgage.
   A spokesman for GE Capital declined to comment for this report.
   Industry observers said it's unlikely that many companies will follow GE
Capital's lead.
   "For most companies retail is the appropriate road because they control
their own destiny in a very cyclical business," said David Lereah, chief
economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.

THRIFTS JUMPED ON FIXED-RATE BANDWAGON IN '95

By SNIGDHA PRAKASH
Sobered by the last refinancing boom, the nation's largest thrifts
decided in 1995 to plunge into the fixed-rate market.
   For more than a decade, most thrifts have stuck to making adjustable-
rate mortgages to hold in their portfolios -  a strategy aimed at earning
interest income while guarding against swings in market rates.
   But last year they decided they couldn't afford to sit out future fixed-
rate lending booms, and began to offer 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. As at
mortgage banks, the loans were intended for sale to the secondary market.
   "We're trying real hard to be competitive in those product lines, and to
get the word out to our realtors that they can come to us for things other
than just (cost-of-funds index) ARMs," said Fredric  J. Forster,
president of Home Savings of America, Irwindale, Calif.
   Mr. Forster said the thrift, which derives interest income from a $53
billion portfolio, wants fee income to bolster its bottom line. Income
derived from servicing mortgages - including those sold to other investors
- was seen as a natural fit.
   Beyond that, thrifts were keen to retain their market share and keep
their loan officers busy during periods when falling rates draw consumers
to fixed-rate loans. But as 1995 progressed, thrifts continued to lag
behind the overall market in fixed-rate originations.
   Sam Lyons, senior vice president at Great Western Bank, Chatsworth,
Calif., pointed to the "heart-wrenching discipline" of mortgage banking.
Mortgage bankers originate every loan knowing that it has to be sold into
the secondary market, he said.
   "It's kind of like salmon swimming upstream - they know where they are
going and what the goal is," Mr. Lyons said. By contrast, the focus at
thrifts is divided between originating loans to hold in portfolio and to
sell in the secondary market, making it more difficult to generate large
fixed-rate volumes.

AFTER ACQUISITION BINGE, NORWEST SEES MARKETING AS THE WAY TO GROW

By KAREN TALLEY
1995 was the year Norwest Mortgage broke into the most exclusive club
in mortgage banking, becoming one of just four companies with a servicing
portfolio topping $100 billion.
   Acquisitions have fueled most of the Des Moines company's growth,
helping it to more than double its servicing assets in two years.
   The Norwest Corp. unit plans to continue expanding this year. But now it
expects much of the growth to come from its own marketing efforts.
   Norwest Corp.'s chairman, Richard M. Kovacevich, contends that banks can
grow most efficiently by mining their customer bases for sales
opportunities.
   "The most effective way to gain revenue and profits is to cross-sell to
customers," he said.
   Norwest's focus on internal growth is likely to spread this year. Big
banking companies that bought mortgage businesses in the merger and
acquisition frenzy of the past two years are finishing the job of absorbing
these operations. The next step is to deliver on the cross-marketing
potential.
   For Norwest Corp., that means offering credit cards, consumer loans, and
private banking services to the mortgage unit's 1.2 million customers - and
offering mortgages across equally diverse product lines.
   Mr. Kovacevich said the mortgage unit's involvement is key to the cross-
selling blitz. Norwest customers - from mutual fund investors to checking
account users - often need mortgages, he said.
   And mortgage loans are the kinds of profitable products that Norwest
needs to stay ahead of competitors, Mr. Kovacevich said. "The war we are in
will be won on the field of revenue."
   Norwest Mortgage's president, Mark Oman, says it will take tremendous
cooperation among operating units for referrals to begin flowing. "The key
to success is how well the group works together as a team," he said.
   Observers agree. "Cross selling is still in its early stages," said Stan
Ross, managing partner at E&Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group, Los
Angeles. "So far there has been limited success."
   Much depends on whether banks can reach a lot of prospects without
sacrificing the personal touch that keeps customers coming back, he
continued.
   "You look at their approach," said Mr. Ross. "Did they use a personal
approach or a mailer? Bankers have to be very proactive in making sure the
customer understands the service."
   Because Norwest has a broad network of mortgage offices, it has a strong
shot at making its aspirations a reality, said Moshe A. Orenbuch, banking
analyst with Bernstein Research.
   With its hundreds of mortgage offices, Norwest could create "a
nationwide financial services network" that offers a range of retail
products, Mr. Orenbuch said.

PNC UNIT WAS A LEADER AMONG LENDERS SEEKING NEW WAYS TO SELL WARES

By KAREN TALLEY
Finding new ways to deliver an old product - the mortgage loan - was a
big theme in 1995, and perhaps no company exemplified it better than PNC
Mortgage.
   In February, the PNC Bank Corp. unit teamed with Coldwell Banker Corp.
in a joint venture to market mortgages directly to homebuyers in real
estate agents' offices. The move gives PNC access to customers in 2,400
Coldwell Banker offices nationwide.
   Seven months later, PNC cut its ties with the 200 outside brokers that
had formed the backbone of its wholesale program, citing too much time and
expense in return for too little profit.
   Both strategies are too new to have proved their worth. But they typify
the creative approaches mortgage lenders are experimenting with these days.
   PNC isn't alone in testing new techniques. In September, for example,
Wells Fargo & Co. stopped extending mortgage loans to its customers,
handing this task off to Norwest Corp.'s mortgage unit.
   Changes like these don't always proceed smoothly. For PNC, the decision
to revamp distribution channels was swiftly followed by a shake-up in its
executive ranks. In November, the company unexpectedly promoted its
president, Saiyid Naqvi, to chief executive, replacing Walter C. Klein Jr.
   PNC said Mr. Klein resigned to pursue other opportunities. But industry
observers said he was eased out after PNC Bancorp decided its mortgage
group didn't need two top executives.
   Mr. Naqvi clearly has high hopes for the Coldwell Banker venture, dubbed
Home Mortgage Network. In an interview last year, he said he expects the
venture to originate about $3 billion of loans annually. PNC Mortgage's
originations totaled $2.3 billion in the first six months of 1995.
   The decision to scrap the wholesaling effort, meanwhile, got positive
reviews from observers.
   PNC is better off, because margins are "very thin" on the wholesale
side, said James M. Schutz, senior bank analyst at Chicago Corp. The
company, he added, already "has a great distribution network" through its
own loan officers and PNC bank branches.
   Industry observers agree that independent brokers are harder to keep
tabs on than in-house sales representatives. Brokers may also lack the kind
of loyalty that would compel them to present very good credits to their
wholesalers, some observers said.
   "It's incumbent upon brokers not to foul the system up by throwing in
bad-quality loans," said Walter W. Vail, executive vice president at
Graystone Mortgage Corp., Boston.
   Still, he said, PNC's decision to drop its broker network probably won't
be widely followed.
   "For every one that drops out another five get in the wholesale
business," Mr. Vail said. "The only way larger institutions will get to
smaller guys in communities is through brokers."

NASD PROPOSAL ON BROKER-DEALERS IS WELL RECEIVED

By WILLIAM PLASENCIA
After three months of fine-tuning, the National Association of
Securities Dealers has issued its final proposal to create a new framework
for bank-affiliated broker-dealers.
   The proposal now goes to the Securities and Exchange Commission for
further review. Final approval is expected by midyear, industry lawyers
said.
   "These rules are intended to eliminate any confusion between uninsured
securities products of broker-dealers and insured deposit products of
financial institutions," said John E. Pinto, executive vice president of
regulation at the NASD. The association, based in Washington, sets
professional standards for the brokerage industry.
   The plan contained few surprises, apart from its size. It came in at
1,235 pages.
   "I think the meat of it will be in the first 65 pages," said Sarah A.
Miller, senior government relations counsel for the American Bankers
Association. She said the NASD, which took its first crack at the rule in
November 1994, had addressed most of the banking industry's concerns.
   The initial draft drew bankers' wrath, with many saying it conflicted
with or duplicated existing rules of bank regulators.
   Mr. Pinto said the association had "honestly taken into account the
comments made by our members. We've tried to insure consistency with the
guidelines that have already been issued by bank regulators."
   The proposal, issued last Thursday, did leave intact certain provisions
that banks had lobbied hard to change.
   For example, the NASD kept a provision that prohibits brokerages from
directly compensating bank employees for referrals. And the agency still
requires that bank customers give written permission before information
about their finances can be shared with brokers.
   Under the proposal, banks would be able to share customers' names,
addresses, and telephone numbers, as well as credit reports, with
affiliated brokerages. Bankers had argued that such information sharing is
crucial to their cross-marketing efforts.
   Ms. Miller said the NASD still needs to clarify some points. For
instance, the proposal limits investment sales in areas "where retail
deposits are taken," but does not explain exactly what this means, she
said.
   But for the most part, bank brokerage executives could find little to
complain about.
   "It almost appears that everything we took exception to was stricken,"
said Joel Calvo, president of PNC Brokerage Corp., Pittsburgh.
   For instance, Mr. Calvo said he was pleased that the NASD dropped a
requirement for brokers to give a lengthy explanation of how Securities
Investor Protection Corp. insurance works.

COMMENT: A LIFE INSURANCE TIME BOMB IN TRUST - AND HOW TO DEFUSE IT

By TED S. BERNSTEIN
Trust departments are confronting substantial liability associated with
the life insurance policies held by trusts under their management.
   However, few banks recognize the potential liability they face. The
stakes are huge, with a potential price tag of tens or even hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   At issue is the estimated $1 trillion in face value of life insurance
policies held by irrevocable trusts.
   Most of these policies were purchased to generate funds to satisfy
federal estate tax liabilities. However, insufficient management of the
policies and today's volatile insurance and financial markets have put the
value of many policies at risk.
   In addition, trust departments are solely responsible for managing
assets in the best interests of the trust and its beneficiaries. If the
policies under a trust department's control fall short, it will be
difficult for banks and trusts to escape liability when beneficiaries
contend that insurance policies were managed inefficiently.
   Already, Crown Life Insurance Co. and New York Life Insurance have paid
$50 million and $65 million respectively to settle lawsuits claiming
vanishing premium fraud. In the suits, disgruntled policyholders contended
that the insurers had promised that premium payments would end after a
specific period. But when policies failed to perform as expected, insurers
demanded additional premiums to keep policies in force. These consumer
issues undoubtedly will spill over into trust management, and banks could
be the focus of policyholders' wrath.
   It is important to understand that trust officers at most banks and
trusts lack the training to review or manage life insurance policies. In
addition, over the past 15 years the life insurance industry has introduced
a variety of products that make purchase decisions more complex.
   Many trust officers try to minimize their liability by holding insurance
policies from carriers with excellent credit ratings. However, it's just
not that simple. The lawsuits being filed today are not claiming damages
due to carrier failures; the basis for these lawsuits is policy
performance.
   Three scenarios most likely to expose banks and trusts to liability
include:
   *Failing to analyze the difference between vanishing premiums and level
premiums.
   *Holding inappropriate or obsolete life insurance policies.
   *Failing to purchase enough life insurance for the premiums paid.
   Beneficiaries and their attorneys could evaluate these issues to
determine whether a policy has performed in accordance with its objectives.
   One situation commonly overlooked by trust departments is adverse health
ratings applied when a policy was first issued.
   Assume that in 1988 an overweight nonsmoking male purchased a $5
million, 15-year level term policy owned by an irrevocable trust. Because
he was overweight, the annual premium payment of $15,000 was 33% higher
than the standard rate.
   Now, seven years later, the insured - no longer overweight - would pay
$10,000 annually for the same death benefit. Or he could maintain his
premium at $15,000 but purchase $1.75 million in additional coverage.
   When the insured dies and the trust begins distributing its funds, the
beneficiaries review the policy and discover that the trust could have
purchased $1.75 million in additional life insurance without increasing
premiums. They decide to sue the bank or trust for mismanagement.
   However, the beneficiaries do not seek $5,000 - the difference in annual
premiums. They seek $1.75 million in damages - the difference in death
benefit.
   Considering that some banks manage as many as 4,000 trusts, the
potential liability is staggering. This example represents one of the many
potential issues banks and trusts confront.
   However, today's prudent-investor laws provide these institutions with
the ability to limit their exposure and liability - particularly if they
obtain the necessary expertise to review the policies of each trust.
   Banks and trusts can significantly reduce their exposure to liability
through several steps.
   Establish corporate policy. Banks should determine whether to absorb the
cost of a policy review or pass the cost along to the trust. And if the
risk associated with life insurance policies is too great to manage, they
should get out of the irrevocable trust business.
   Determine how often policies will be reviewed. Most banks review
policies at least every two years.
   Select an experienced insurance consultant or firm to assess the life
insurance policies held by trusts. To keep the consultant's recommendations
impartial, banks and trusts should prohibit consultants from selling life
insurance policies to the trusts they evaluate.
   Demand more service from insurance companies. Have them provide the
ratings they receive from every service that evaluates them. Also, ask for
information about the junk bonds and troubled real estate held in the
company's portfolio as a percentage of its net worth.
   Policy reviews can generate significant client good will. By conducting
the reviews, banks and trusts help policyholders fully understand their
specific policies, often for the first time.
   The reviews also allow trust departments to demonstrate their active
management of trust assets. Finally, reviews help banks and trusts reduce
their exposure to liability.
   It's a "win-win" situation for all parties involved.
   Mr. Bernstein is president of Trustee Consulting Corp., a Chicago-based
firm that advises on personal trust issues.

TRUST RULES MAY BE EASED FOR MULTISTATE NATIONAL BANKS

By KATHARINE FRASER
National banks with trust departments operating in several states may
soon get a break on the cost of doing business.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has issued a proposal that
would allow banks to account for all trust operations at their headquarters
rather than having to maintain separate books in each state they do
business in.
   Trust bankers see the OCC proposal - outlined in a Dec. 21 letter - as a
welcome reprieve. Currently, national banks with trust operations in two or
more states must maintain staffs in each state that do nothing but prepare
for state examinations.
   "It's a lot easier to run a business under a single regulatory roof,"
said David J. Kundert, chairman and chief executive officer of  Banc One
Corp.'s investment management and trust group.
   Mr. Kundert believes that a relaxation of regulatory demands could help
Banc One compete with nonbank investment managers that do not have to
adhere to the same regulations as national banks.
   "You need to level the playing field to compete with those kind of
firms," Mr. Kundert said.
   First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, is also supportive of the proposal,
according to a bank spokeswoman.
   The OCC proposal, if enacted, would represent the first major revision
of the agency's 32-year-old rule defining how fiduciary businesses can be
conducted by national banks whose trust businesses are also subject to
state regulations. The proposal comes on the heels of an OCC interpretive
letter issued on Dec. 8 that allows national banks to offer trust services
outside their home states without having to set up new branches.
   "Much about the national banks fiduciary business has changed since
(1963) including ... the structures and operational methods that banks use
to deliver those services," reads the OCC notice.
   While the OCC proposal would allow for accounting and business
administration to be streamlined, that does not mean that banks could use a
cookie cutter to deliver trust services to clients in different states.
   The agency writes that case-by-case determinations would be made whether
or not state laws regarding the conduct of trust relationships can be
preempted by federal oversight.
   "They have clearly opened the door to banks doing their administration
on a uniform basis out of the headquarters state," said John P.C. Duncan, a
partner at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, which counsels banks on interstate
issues.
   But, Mr. Duncan observes that the OCC is making a distinction between
streamlining bean-counts and implementing any standardized investment
policies.
   All 50 states have different "prudent investor" rules that govern what
types of investments are acceptable and how they should be disclosed.
   The OCC is inviting comment on how to minimize the differences among
investment laws so national banks can operate on a uniform basis.
   "We're dealing in a national environment now, and it's important that
banks and customers both know what law applies," Mr. Duncan said.
   State consumer interests and regulators have until Feb. 20 to submit
comments to the OCC.
   In the meantime, the affected banks are offering their support to the
proposed regulation.
   Banc One is a classic example of a banking company that stands to gain
much from this OCC proposal. The institution would like to whittle down its
far-flung banking operations to a single charter someday.
   Banc One has 60 affiliate banks in 11 states, compared with 88 three
years ago. In each state, there are three or four separately chartered
business units that all have to be accounted for.
   Other trust executives at banks with similar situations would welcome
any opportunity to centralize the business.
   "The current approach is encumbered by a variety of different
regulations," said Daniel E. Klimas, KeyCorp's executive vice president for
private banking and investing. "This new proposal may offer us a more
economical way of offering those services," he added.
   Though Mr. Klimas said he is supportive of the OCC proposal, he expects
an onslaught of litigation from state regulators before anything is
resolved.
   Like Banc One, KeyCorp sees a clear benefit to consolidating the
reporting of its segmented trust departments.
   "We are supportive of anything that allows us to look at ourselves and
run a business on a national basis instead of several independently," Mr.
Klimas said.

HOPES FOR WIDER POWERS NOW PINNED ON COURTS, REGULATORS-NOT
CONGRESS

By JUSTIN FOX
When 1995 began, a new Republican majority on Capitol Hill seemed
poised to release banks from the shackles that had kept them a step or two
behind the rest of the financial services industry.
   No such luck.
   Instead, the good news for bankers came from the courts and the
regulators. The Supreme Court affirmed banks' right to sell annuities. The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. cut premium rates to all-time lows. All the
banking regulatory agencies trumpeted regulation-cutting reforms.
   The only major banking legislation Congress approved was a Savings
Association Insurance Fund rescue that will - if President Clinton signs it
- cost banks and thrifts more than $20 billion.
   Should the industry look to Congress for answers in 1996? Probably not.
   Bank lobbyists say there is no predicting what lawmakers might do,
particularly if plans to follow the thrift fund fix with a merger of the
bank and thrift charters gain momentum.
   But the stalemate persists in the House of Representatives between
supporters of broader bank powers and insurance agents who want to protect
their turf. What's more, with elections looming, Congress is likely to
effectively shut down by summer.
   The courts and banking agencies, meanwhile, will keep on judging and
regulating. And they could take actions this year that have a big impact on
the business of banking.
   First up is the Supreme Court, which on Jan. 16 will hear oral arguments
in Barnett v. Gallagher, the attempt by Barnett Banks Inc. to overturn
Florida laws that keep it from selling insurance.
   Last January, the court ruled in banks' favor in a case challenging
North Carolina-based NationsBank's right to sell annuities, and many in the
industry expect a similarly favorable Barnett decision before midyear.
   Bank lawyers think the court also will decide to hear another important
banking case - dealing with credit card issuers' right to charge late fees
to out-of-state customers.
   A win in the Barnett case would let banks use current federal law to
launch insurance marketing efforts from branches in towns with fewer than
5,000 people.
   It also would likely embolden Comptroller of the Currency Eugene A.
Ludwig. The comptroller laid off proposals to expand bank powers last year
after receiving a series of stinging letters on insurance and other issues
from House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach.
   If the Supreme Court acts and Congress does not, the door will be opened
for Mr. Ludwig to revive his plans to let bank subsidiaries move into lines
of business now generally off-limits to banks.
   But if the Supreme Court hands banks a victory, insurance agents are not
likely to sit idly by. "It could whip them into a frenzy," said Kenneth
Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association
of America.
   All this points to rough sailing for Rep. Leach's bid to break down some
of the Glass-Steagall Act barriers that keep commercial banks out of the
securities business. In September, insurance agents' pressure led House
leaders to combine Rep. Leach's bill with a regulatory relief measure and a
moratorium on the Comptroller's ability to grant banks new insurance
powers, making for a legislative stew unpalatable to most banking groups.

   Rep. Leach will keep fighting for passage of his bill, Mr. Guenther
said, but others believe it is more likely that regulatory relief - along
the lines of the bill approved in September by the Senate Banking
Committee, which doesn't touch the controversial Community Reinvestment Act
- will be decoupled from Glass-Steagall and enacted on its own.
   Then there's the charter merger. In return for being forced to chip in
almost $600 million a year for 22 years to help pay the interest on bonds
from the savings and loan bailout, commercial banks have clamored for an
end to the federal thrift charter.
   Thrifts now possess insurance, affiliation, and branching powers that
banks don't, and some in the industry see the charter merger as a back-door
way to improve the bank charter. But any major changes would run up against
the same forces that have halted Glass-Steagall reform, while an attempt to
force savings institutions into the existing bank charter would be fiercely
opposed by many thrifts.
   Thrifts also want to make sure the industry isn't forced to pay billions
in back taxes on their so-called bad-debt deductions as part of a charter
merger - although agreements by House and Senate tax writers late last year
put such fears largely to rest.
   "We do not want to see our people hurt because of this," said Randall
McFarlane, director of governmental relations for America's Community
Bankers, the leading thrift trade group.
   Thus, while Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, chairman of the Banking
Committee, has promised action on the charter merger by Easter, chances are
good that the issue won't be resolved this year.
   More likely to be dealt with in 1996 is a Federal Home Loan Bank System
modernization bill, which foundered in 1995 because of disputes over
dividing the 12 Home Loan Banks' payments on thrift bailout bonds.
   If Glass-Steagall reform indeed goes nowhere in 1996, bank groups plan
to start pushing regulatory buttons - urging the Federal Reserve Board to
let bank holding companies' section 20 subsidiaries get more of their
income from securities activities that banks themselves cannot engage in.
   Currently, such business - which includes underwriting municipal bonds,
dealing in consumer receivables, and underwriting corporate debt and equity
- can't provide more than 10% of the income of a bank holding company
subsidiary. Bank lawyers say the Fed has the legal leeway to raise that
limit as high as 49%.
   The Fed already has a proposal in the works to make the limit more
flexible. In a December speech, Fed governor Susan M. Phillips said the
board definitely will consider raising the limit if Congress fails to act.
   The Fed and the other banking agencies are also in the midst of
campaigns to rewrite their rules to reduce confusion and regulatory burden,
and make the examination process more "banker-friendly."
   The Comptroller's office has been most aggressive, mixing regulatory
relief with new powers for national banks. James D. McLaughlin, director of
agency relations for the American Bankers Association, said he doesn't
expect other regulators to go that far, but does see real reductions in
paperwork and other hassles on the horizon for bankers.
   The agencies also promised that the new community reinvestment rules
they approved in April will make life easier for banks and thrifts. Exams
under the new rules start this month, giving banks a chance to judge
whether their regulators were right.
   Also sure to show up in 1996 exams - particularly those by the Federal
Reserve and the Comptroller's office - is an increased emphasis on risk
management, something regulators talked about often in 1995.
   Then there are the deposit insurance premiums. Throughout 1995, banks
pushed the FDIC to cut them further and faster as the once-depleted Bank
Insurance Fund returned to health. But the industry had nothing more to
complain about after Nov. 14, when the FDIC cut most banks' premiums to the
legal minimum of $2,000 a year.
   In 1996, bank premiums can't go down any more. In fact, they will almost
certainly go up about 2 basis points as part of the thrift fund rescue.
   As of last week, however, the budget reconciliation bill that includes
the thrift fund plan was still caught in the tug-of-war between President
Clinton and Congress.
   The savings fund proposal, which would let the FDIC drop thrifts'
premiums to bank levels, is not the subject of any tension between the
President and Congress. But if the budget legislation were to collapse
completely and the thrift fund legislation were considered separately, 1996
would witness a Capitol Hill battle royal between thrift executives who
want their fund fixed and bankers who don't want to help pay for it, Mr.
Guenther said.
   No one is predicting that this is will happen. But then again, as 1995
showed, predictions can be wrong.

NATIONSBANK WANTS CLASS ACTION DENIED IN FAIR-LENDING LAWSUIT

By JARET SEIBERG
Trying to limit its potential liability, NationsBank Corp. asked a
federal judge last week to deny class-action status for a pending
fair-lending lawsuit.
   The bank charged the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and
Urban Affairs with missing the deadline to seek class-action certification.
   "By failing to move for class certification by Dec. 20, 1995, which was
90 days from the date on which the class complaint was filed, plaintiffs
directly violated (the) local rule," the bank said in Dec. 26 memorandum
filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
"Accordingly, plaintiffs' class-action allegations should be stricken in
their entirety."
   John Relman, director of the fair-housing project at the Washington
Lawyers Committee, said the group hasn't missed the deadline. He declined
to elaborate, saying he will explain the group's position in a future court
filing.

   Class-action status is crucial to the lawyers committee's case, which
alleges that NationsBank discriminated against borrowers. The bank would
have much more to lose fighting a class action in court.
   Without class status, the case involves only 13 plaintiffs and nine loan
applications; even if NationsBank lost, the damage award would be limited.
But with class-action status, the lawyer's committee could seek
compensation for all similarly affected consumers. That could raise the
bank's tab dramatically.
   The bank also argued that the lawyers committee has had since its
December 1994 press conference announcing its fair-lending initiative to
search for clients. It said the group has employed a toll-free number,
meetings with community groups, and a "carefully orchestrated" media
campaign.
   Still, NationsBank noted that just 11 plaintiffs joined the lawsuit,
which was filed Sept. 21. Two months of publicity persuaded only one more
person to join the case, NationsBank told the court.
   "If the plaintiffs believe they have meritorious individual claims, they
should be required to litigate them as such," the bank said. "NationsBank
should be subjected to no further prejudicial adverse publicity tied to
grandiose promises of class-action litigation that the plaintiffs' counsel
have been unable to fulfill."
   NationsBank said this is not the first time the lawyers committee failed
to file its papers on time. It said in the memorandum that a federal judge
"sternly admonished" the group for failing to file a timely class action
request in a 1982 employment discrimination case.
   According to the memorandum, the judge allowed the committee to file the
request late. But he warned them not to let it happen again.
   "Plaintiffs chose to bring this as a class action and it is time for
them to fish or cut bait," the judge said.

MUSICAL CHAIRS AT OCC; NEW AIDE FOR BEREUTER, HEAVYWEIGHTS AT N.Y. FED

Mark P. Jacobsen was named senior adviser to Comptroller of the
Currency Eugene A. Ludwig last week. After joining the agency in January
1994, Mr. Jacobsen was special assistant to the chief counsel. Before that
he had
been an associate with the law firm of Covington & Burling, where Mr.
Ludwig was a partner.
   Mr. Jacobsen replaces Ballard Gilmore, who is now director of licensing
operations in the agency's bank organization department.
   Meanwhile, John Hartzell has left his post as deputy comptroller for
international banking for, of all things, an international bank.
   Mr. Hartzell, who left last month, will soon join the New York office of
Dresdner Bank, which is based in Frankfurt. His new title will be director
of economic and group strategy. The Comptroller's office has not chosen a
replacement.
                              ***
   Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., has hired Alan Brubaker as his new banking
aide. Mr. Brubaker, 28, most recently worked as a loan officer with a
Maryland mortgage company, but has Capitol Hill experience. From 1989 to
1991 he was a staff member with the House Republican Conference.
   Rep. Bereuter is sponsor of the House's regulatory-relief bill, which
would cut bank paperwork and red tape. The legislation is stalled because
of banks' opposition to restrictions on their insurance powers.
   Mr. Brubaker replaces Joe Pigg, who left in October to be a Washington
lobbyist for New York City.
                              ***
   Investment banker John C. Whitehead, insurance executive Thomas W.
Jones, and balanced-budget crusader Peter G. Peterson have been named to
the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   Mr. Whitehead, a former State Department deputy secretary and former co-
chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Co., now heads AEA Investors Inc. He will be
chairman of the New York Fed board.
   Tapped as deputy chairman was Mr. Jones, who is vice chairman,
president, and chief operating officer of Teachers Insurance and Annuity
Association-College Retirement Equities Fund.
   Mr. Peterson is a former secretary of commerce and former CEO of Lehman
Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc. He now heads the Blackstone Group, an investment
firm, but is perhaps best known for founding the Concord Coalition, a
nonprofit group pushing for a balanced federal budget.
   The Federal Reserve Board appointed the three men; the other six members
of the New York Fed board are elected by Fed member banks.
                              ***
   Gail L. Patelunas is the new acting director of the division of
resolutions at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. She takes the place
vacated by Robert H. Hartheimer, who resigned as of Dec. 31 to join the
Alexandria, Va., investment banking firm of Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &
Co.
   Since 1994, Ms. Patelunas has been associate director of the division,
which is responsible for the resolution of failing FDIC-insured banks and
thrifts. Before that she was assistant director of resolutions, and before
joining the FDIC in 1990 she worked at the Federal Reserve Board, Kidder,
Peabody & Co., and KPMG Peat Marwick.
                              ***
   Lynn Reaser is the new chairman of the American Bankers Association's
economic advisory committee. She replaces Alan Gayle who just completed a
two-year term.
   Ms. Reaser is senior vice president and chief economist at First
Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.
   In her ABA post she will oversee the committee's forecasts of economic
indicators and national and regional economic issues. The panel's next
semiannual economic forecast and monetary policy recommendation will be
announced Jan. 24.
   The committee's new vice chairman is Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at
First Fidelity Bancorp. in Philadelphia.

ROYAL BANK OF CANADA TRIMS U.S. OPERATIONS TO ZERO IN ON PROFITS

By DANIEL DUNAIEF
Less is more for the U.S. businesses of Canada's biggest bank,  Royal
Bank of Canada.
   In the last three years, U.S. senior vice president and general manager
David L. Robertson has reduced the bank's corporate client base to about
685 from 1,500.
   At the same time, he has reduced the bank's staff to 217 from 415, even
as the bank has added an asset-backed securities business, a syndication
distribution business, and a structured finance team.
   And Mr. Robertson is not done. He plans to reduce the number of
corporate clients even further in 1996, to 600, focusing on multinational
companies that present the greatest opportunities for the bank.
   In conjunction with its investment banking affiliate Dominion
Securities, Royal Bank has been building its expertise in various capital
markets arenas, hoping to develop a critical mass of business to justify
doing business with each customer.
   "We want to be able to deliver at least three or four main products to
each of our clients," said the 53-year-old Mr. Robertson.
   The bank also hopes to find companies that have subsidiaries in Canada,
where it can provide a branch network and services ranging from payroll to
cash management.
   The strategy has worked so far, with fewer customers accounting for more
revenues.
   Mr. Robertson estimated that revenues from U.S.-based banking had
reached 10% to 12% of gross revenues, up from about 8% three years ago when
he took over the U.S. operations.
   Some of that increased profitability can be attributed to  growth in
specific business lines.
   "We've more than trebled the amount of foreign exchange and capital
markets derivatives that we deliver to the remaining clients," said Mr.
Robertson.
   The key products Royal Bank is looking to deliver include trade finance,
syndicated loans and standby lines of credit, foreign exchange, capital
markets derivatives, and equity derivatives.
   To that end, Dominion Securities last year added 20 former Kidder
Peabody equity derivatives traders to its staff.
   Additionally, this fall the bank raised its profile among U.S. investors
by listing its stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Mr. Robertson said the listing was "a first step," as the bank continues
to view the United States as an area for expansion in such areas as retail
banking, fund management, and regional investment banking.
   While the New York Stock Exchange listing presents an opportunity for an
acquisition, it's not something the bank considers practical right now.
"You see what everyone wants to pay to buy banks these days?" Mr. Robertson
asked.
   Down the road, Mr. Robertson said, the United States presents an ideal
area for expansion, especially as laws like the Depression-era Glass-
Steagall Act and the Bank Holding Company Act change.
   "If you look at North America and at the North American Free Trade
Agreement, (a strategic acquisition) would be a natural expansion for us,"
he said.
   The Royal Bank executive said that a focused strategy is the right
approach in a foreign marketplace.
   Indeed, Mr. Robertson, who has been with the bank for 36 years, has done
three stints outside Canada, including one in London, and articulated the
need for targeted competition.
   "You can't compete with Natwest or Barclays on the ground in England and
really make any money," said Mr. Robertson. "When you're outside the
country, you have to try to deliver certain things you can do profitably."
   The Royal Bank favors profitability over size.
   With about a $6 billion-asset base in the United States, the bank has
the smallest amount of American assets among Canadian banks.
   "We're not chasing assets," said Mr. Robertson. "We concentrate on
products, and if it results in assets, that's fine."

CONSUMER DELINQUENCY SPURRING SHORT SALES

By JAMES C. ALLEN and STEPHEN KLEEGE
Sharp divisions are developing on Wall Street over the recent upticks
in consumer loan delinquencies.
   Short-sellers are betting on further damage to consumer finance
companies, while some stock analysts are touting buying opportunities in
the stocks.
   A case in point is Olympic Financial Ltd., a Minneapolis-based auto
lender that won a "buy" affirmation from Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette last
week - after the short interest in its shares had soared 65% in a month.
   The skepticism about consumer lenders helped push up short interest in
bank-related shares traded on the National Association of Securities
Dealers' system by 9.5% in the month ended Dec. 15. The rise in bank short
interest came amid a general decline in short interest in stocks traded on
the over-the-counter system. (See tables on pages 22 and 24.)
   Short interest is the outstanding volume of shares sold short - that is,
borrowed and promptly sold. Short-sellers are betting that the stock price
will fall, so their short positions can be covered profitably with cheaper
shares.
   Earlier, the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange
reported a slight decline in bank-related short interest. The basket of
bank stocks traded on the Nasdaq includes numerous small, retail-oriented
banks and thrifts that could be seen as vulnerable to rising delinquencies.
   Short interest in Olympic Financial - which provides auto finance mostly
to "prime," or creditworthy, consumers - rose by nearly 1.8 million shares,
to more than 4.6 million shares. It was the largest short position in the
bank-related group.
   RCSB Financial, a Rochester, N.Y., thrift holding company, had the
largest short position relative to its daily trading volume. Its short
position of 2.3 million shares represents 21.1 days of average trading.
   RCSB had the fourth-largest short position in total among the Nasdaq
bank-related issues, behind Olympic and Boatmen's Bancshares, the St. Louis
based regional bank, with 2.7 million shares sold short.
   The second-biggest increase was in the Money Store, the well-known home
equity lender. The Money Store's short position increased by 848,852 shares
to 1.5 million shares - the 10th-largest total.
   Olympic Financial's shares were trading at $16 last week, off from more
than $30 in September. Short-sellers apparently believe Olympic could fall
even further because of what analyst Andrew Jeffrey of Rodman & Renshaw
calls its "loss deferral strategy."
   "I think the assumptions they have used are unrealistic, given the type
of paper they are buying," said Mr. Jeffrey, who specializes in companies
that make auto loans to less creditworthy consumers.
   Olympic's chairman and chief executive Jeffrey Mack insists the
company's loss assumptions are based on historical performance: Loan losses
are currently running at an annualized rate of 65 to 75 basis points, or
130 basis points to 140 basis points over the average two-year life of a
loan, he said.
   He said the company is setting aside nearly 172 basis points to cover
any variance that economic swings cause for the portfolio.
   "On top of that, we have set up what we call general reserves, which are
other allocated reserves in the millions of dollars, to add further
protection," he said.
   But that is not enough, Mr. Jeffrey said. He said General Motors
Acceptance Corp., also a prime lender, has experienced cumulative losses of
200 basis points during previous economic downturns.
   Another disconcerting factor for Mr. Jeffrey is the manner in which
Olympic disposes of its repossessed automobiles. Instead of auctioning the
autos as its competitors do, Olympic puts the cars on a used-car lot and
sells them on consignment, he said.
   By doing so, he said the company is increasing its future losses because
it is making greater concessions in order to get the asset sold.
   But some observers said the pessimists are misguided.
   Thomas Brown, a banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said
that short-sellers tend to be paranoid and that they are "wrong in assuming
this is a giant conspiracy."
   The rating agencies, third-party guarantors, and Olympic's accountants
have all signed off on the company's assumptions regarding such things as
prepayment speeds and loan-loss reserves, Mr. Brown said.
   "In my experience it's typical of the way short-sellers have tried to
jump on financial stocks," he said. "It makes a good story until you
examine it."
   Mr. Brown said even if losses exceed the level of reserves the company
has set aside, it is unlikely that shareholders will see a significant
reduction in current earnings to cover any losses.
   If he's right, a lot of short-sellers will be licking their wounds next
year.

STOCK OF SYSTEMS, PROCESSING FIRMS JUMPED 34% IN '96

By BRIAN TRACEY
Like in the rest of the U.S. equities market, 1995 was a terrific year
for bank technology stocks.
   The publicly traded financial systems and processing-services firms
tracked by American Banker saw their stock prices rise an average of 34%
last year.
   That hefty increase was statistically in line with the Standard & Poor's
index of 500 stocks and the Dow Jones industrial average, which both rose
by about one-third in 1995.
   But what was even more interesting was that only 6 of the 30 listed
financial systems stocks lost value over the 12-month period, while 13
outperformed the average gain. The number of advancing stocks far exceeded
1994 performance levels, when just 13 out of 28 firms experienced gains.
   Wall Street analysts said the bull market in 1995 was led mainly by the
technology sector, as more consumers and companies sought to leverage the
latest advances in computer and telecommunications systems.
   Banks and their technology vendors seem to be at the nexus of this
trend, observers said. Financial institutions increasingly see technology
as vital to their future competitive positioning, as well as providing the
means to link up with their most profitable customers.
   Payment systems and information processing firms are "the growth stocks
of the next century," said Richard K. Weingarten, an analyst at Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco. "They're the new Cokes and Pepsis and
Gillettes of the world."
   Like 1994, payment services and financial application software companies
offered the best returns on investment. Leading the pack was bank software
developer Jack Henry & Associates, which saw its stock appreciate a
whopping 156% in 1995.
   Kevin J. Dyches, an analyst with George K. Baum & Co. in Kansas City,
said Jack Henry's big gain was mainly attributable to the company's June
acquisition of the community banking software business of Broadway &
Seymour Inc.
   "Through that acquisition, Jack Henry increased their customer base by
33%," Mr. Dyches said. "At that time, their market value was about $150
million, and they bought a company that was one-third their size for $12
million." He also noted that the acquisition was profitable in the first
quarter after Monett, Mo.-based Jack Henry acquired the business.
   Mr. Dyches added that Jack Henry was generating internal revenue growth
through sales of its Silverlake core accounting system, designed for
midsize banks with between $100 million and $10 billion in assets.
   The second-biggest percentage gain among financial systems firms was
Concord EFS Inc., a provider of payments systems services to retailers.
Then Memphis-based firm's stock rose 146% during 1995.
   Two years ago, Concord's stock dipped after some weak-performing
quarters, but since then "they've gained back the confidence of the
market," Mr. Weingarten said. "They had the strongest internal growth of
any company in the payment services group."
   He added that Concord's specialty is provident credit and debit point of
sale systems to supermarkets, "which is the fastest growing part of the
payments processing business."
   Hogan Systems Inc., another bank software firm, gave its stockholders a
tidy profit for the year: its common stock rose 110%. After months of
speculation, Dallas-based Hogan agreed last month to be acquired by
Continuum Co., an Austin, Tex.-based developer of systems for the insurance
industry, in stock swap currently valued at about $200 million.
   It's also interesting to note that two of the best-performing stocks in
1994, Charlotte, N.C.-based Broadway & Seymour and San Rafael, Calif.-based
Fair, Isaac & Co. lost ground in 1995.
   The common stock value of Fair, Isaac, a developer of credit scoring
systems, dropped 9%. for the year.
   Broadway & Seymour, after peaking at $31 a share last summer, has
skidded back to about $16 a share after the company announced it would take
a fourth-quarter restructuring charge.

DELUXE WILL TAKE RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $60M TO $70M

By BRIAN TRACEY
Check printing firm Deluxe Corp., acknowledging that its future success
lies more in electronic banking, said last week it would take $60 million
to $70 million restructuring charge.
   Executives at St. Paul-based Deluxe said last week that the fourth-
quarter charge to earnings would cover expenses related to the closing of
several check printing facilities and other writeoffs in several business
units.
   The company has seen its profit margins shrink in its core check
printing business in recent years as the banking industry has consolidated.
In addition, electronic payments are expected to slowly begin replacing
paper checks as consumers increasingly use bank cards.
   "Our earnings declines over the last three years have clearly been a
disappointment to our shareholders and employees, and it is now time to
begin reversing that trend," said J. A. "Gus" Blanchard, Deluxe's president
and chief executive officer, who added that the restructuring should
generate $100 million to $125 million in annual expense savings by the end
of 1997.
   Mr. Blanchard said that as part of its new strategy, the company plans
to enhance its electronic banking and other types of information services
for financial institutions, mainly through its Deluxe Data unit, a leading
third-party processor of automated teller machine transactions.
   "Through our Deluxe Data subsidiary, we already provide a variety of
transaction processing and settlement capabilities as well as applications
for linking various back-office functions," Mr. Blanchard  said. "Our new
plan calls for strengthening our existing offerings as well as broadening
our total value proposition, with the objective being to permit our client
financial institutions to connect their customers to any banking
application ... by whatever electronic means the customer chooses."
   Deluxe officials also said they plan to beef up their product offerings
in the payment protection arena, as banks have been forced to eat billions
of dollars in fraudulent transactions in recent years.
