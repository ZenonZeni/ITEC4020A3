<B><A NAME="case_studies">CASE STUDIES<B><!--CASE STUDIES--></B> </A></B> <P>
<B>Many of the complaints regarding physical abuse involved extreme physical force and several resulted in serious injury to the complainant.The following case studies provide an insight into the sort of mistreatment reported.</B> <P>
<B><a name="cs1">CASE STUDY 1</a>. </B> <P>
<B>The complainant was severely bashed with a torch over the head whilst handcuffed and was then subjected to six hours of systematic beatings at the Brighton police station until such time as he signed a statement. This beating was so severe that the complainant suffered severe bruising, internal injuries, concussion and a fractured skull, which have resulted in ongoing mental, psychological and nervous disorders that have forced the complainant onto sickness benefits.</B> <P>
<B><a name = "cs2">CASE STUDY 2</a>.</B> <P>
<B>The complainant was taken to the St.Kilda police station where he was strip searched, hit about the face with heavy belt and buckle, and then handcuffed and laid on his back where he was kicked more than 20 times in the testicles and upper body. As a result of this &quot;interrogation&quot; the complainant suffered severe bruising to the head and chest, and the bruising to his groin was so severe that it was described as &quot;blackened&quot;. </B> <P>
<B><a name = "cs3">CASE STUDY 3</a>. </B> <P>
<B>The complainant was taken to St.Kilda police station where he was bashed so severely by three officers from the St.Kilda CIB that he suffered two broken ribs and had his arm broken in three places which required a plaster cast for 10 weeks.</B> <P>
<B><a name = "cs4">CASE STUDY 4</a>. </B> <P>
<B>In an incident involving St.Kilda police, three Vietnamese men were taken into custody for alleged soliciting. During their 10 hours in custody they where denied interpreters, and were subjected to such physical abuse that one of them was coughing blood upon release and admitted himself immediately to hospital. These men were not only subjected to extreme physical assault, but also experienced both verbal and psychological abuse which appeared to exhibit distinct overtones of racism. None of these men were charged with any offence other than resisting arrest and assaulting police.</B> <P>
<B><a name = "cs5">CASE STUDY 5</a>.</B> <P>
<B>The complainant was dragged from his caravan at gun point by members of the Armed Robbery Squad, handcuffed and hooded with a hessian bag secured by a rope around his neck whereupon he was bashed by six police. One officer who bashed and threatened him told him that he had already killed one person. The complainant suffered broken ribs and rope burn to the neck.</B> <P>
<B><a name = "cs6">CASE STUDY 6</a>.</B> <P>
<B>The complainant was stopped and dragged from her car by police who handcuffed her and slammed her head into the roof of the car whilst her 15 month old baby sat in the back seat. After she arrived at Fairfield police station she reports that she was kicked so severely in the breast that she still suffered from severe bruising and pain three weeks after the incident.</B> <P>
<B><a name="cs7">CASE STUDY 7</a>.</B> <P>
<B>Another incident involved two officers from the Oakleigh station. The woman involved complained of being bashed over the head with a baton whilst another male officer held her and bent her thumb back almost to breaking point. One of the officers then taunted her with threats of sexual assault.</B> <P>
<B><a name = "cs8">CASE STUDY 8</a>.</B> <P>
<B>One of the most serious incidents of police assault was reported by a man who was apprehended in St.Albans and kneed and punched in the process of being taken to the police station. The complainant already had a broken left hand at the time of apprehension. He reports that he was eventually taken to the Sunshine police cells where he was left screaming in pain for three and a half hours. Finally two police officers took him to hospital, during which several threats were made against the complainant that made him fear for his life. The complainant had suffered a broken knee as a result of this incident and was unable to walk, however no assistance was given to him. The complainant reports that four months after the incident he has still not recovered from his injury.</B> <P>
<B><a name = "cs9">CASE STUDY 9</a>. </B> <P>
<B>One woman reported that she was picked up in the street and taken to the Moonee Ponds station where she was refused a lawyer and then bashed by an officer resulting in a broken nose. </B> <P>
<B><a name = "cs10">CASE STUDY 10</a>. </B> <P>
<B>One man complained of being bashed in a divisional van on the way to Fitzroy police station, where he was forced to &quot;run the gauntlet&quot; of several police officers with batons behind the roller door at the rear of the station. He reports further bashing and kicking whilst being held by Fitzroy CIB resulting in severe bruising to head, back, legs and groin. </B> <P>
<B><a name="cs11">CASE STUDY 11 </a>- MISUSE OF FIREARMS </B> <P>
<B>There were several reported incidents involving police threatening complainants with firearms. </B> <P>
<B>i) One man reported that whilst being interviewed by the Armed Robbery Squad at the St.Kilda Road complex he was refused an interpreter and had a gun held to his head and told if he didn't speak he would be shot.</B> <P>
<B>ii) Another complainant reported that an officer from Footscray put the complainant's hand on his revolver and warned him that &quot;there's a bullet in here for you&quot;.</B> <P>
<B><a name="cs12">CASE STUDY 12</a>. </B> <P>
<B>In another incident the complainant reported that police were called to a party where he was assaulted by two officers who then drove him in the back of a divisional van to Flemington police station. The complainant reports that the officers deliberately drove in a reckless manner causing him to be thrown around the back of the van. Once at the station he was further bashed causing serious head injuries including a punctured eardrum.</B> <P>
<B><a name="cs13">CASE STUDY 13</a>. </B> <P>
<B>A complainant reported that she was grabbed by the hair and kneed in the face by an officer from Flemington police, resulting in a broken nose.</B> <P>
<B><a name="cs14">CASE STUDY 14.</a> </B> <P>
<B>One seventeen year old complainant reported that he was assaulted by two police officers at Rosebud police station. Amongst various physical assaults he was picked up by his collar and belt and swung about the interview room and also held in the air by his ankles and dropped on his head. The officers also warned him that if he made a complaint he would be &quot;dumped off Cape Schanck&quot;. </B> <P>
<B><a name="cs15">CASE STUDY 15.</a> </B> <P>
<B>One complainant who was 7 months pregnant at the time reported that seven officers from Flemington burst into her home, grabbed her, pulled her across a coffee table and dragged her to the floor. She was then taken to the bedroom where she was strip searched. The complainant was not charged. She reported that as a result of the incident complications with her pregnancy arose and that the baby was born 6 weeks prematurely due to these complications. A formal complaint was lodged with I.I.D., but the only action taken was to &quot;counsel&quot; the officers involved as to appropriate raid procedures. </B> <P>
<B><a name="cs16">CASE STUDY 16</a> - MISUSE OF STRIP SEARCH</B> <P>
<B>Other forms of abuse complained of, included a large proportion of strip searches carried out for no particular reason. </B> <P>
<B>i) In one incident a Kensington woman who was eight months pregnant reported that she was strip searched after having had her front door broken down by eight police who had a warrant to search for marijuana.</B> <P>
<B>ii) Several women reported that they were strip searched by male officers in contravention of Police Standing Orders.</B> <P>
<B>iii) One Vietnamese man was strip searched by officers from the Asian squad solely for the purpose of discovering whether he was in possession of firecrackers.</B> <P>
<B>iv) Another man reported that he was entrapped and taken in on prostitution charges. At the St.Kilda station he was strip searched and internally searched by officers with a baton. The man reports the manner in which the search took place effectively amounted to rape. </B> <P>
<B>v) Another man reported that he was pulled over for drink driving and back at St.Kilda police station he was strip searched in front of female officers whom he states were &quot;just there to watch&quot;. </B> <P>
<B>vi) In another report, a 15 year old boy detained for criminal damage was forced to strip by an officer from Reservoir, who then forced him to bend over and &quot;spread his cheeks&quot;. As noted by the person recording this incident, the boy had no criminal history nor reason to suspect him of drug use, and that the actions of the officer were intended to frighten and humiliate him.</B> <P>
<B><a name = "cs17">CASE STUDY 17 - SOLICITING AND ENTRAPMENT</a></B> <P>
<B>i) A number of incidents related to entrapment, or soliciting. One woman reported that she had just alighted from a taxi when two police officers pulled up and searched her hand bag. When they discovered 3 condoms in her bag she was arrested for soliciting and taken to Elwood for questioning. She reports that at the station she was sexually harassed and strip searched by the two male officers. </B> <P>
<B>ii) One man reported that he was approached by a man in public toilets in Melton who made sexual advances toward him. When he responded to these advances the man become became violent and assaulted the complainant and threw him against a brick wall. It was only after this that the man identified himself as a police officer and was joined by another officer. Whilst handcuffed and forced against the wall the complainant was further assaulted by both officers. The complainant was eventually taken back to Melton police station and charged with indecent behaviour and indecent assault.</B> <P>
<B>iii) In another incident of entrapment, a man reported that he was approached by a woman in St.Kilda who proposed to have sex with him for an amount of money. It transpired that the woman was an undercover police officer and the complainant was questioned in relation to soliciting.</B> <P>
<B><a name="cs18">CASE STUDY 18 </a>- FAILURE TO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PERSON </B> <P>
<B>A number of other complaints concerned abuse, threats and denial of independent third parties to people with an intellectual disability. In one instance a man who was registered as a client with the Office of Intellectual Disability Services was taken to City West police station where he was punched in the head and had his head pushed into a table. He was then threatened with further physical assault and verbally abused. He was also refused an independent third party to attend during his two and a half hours in custody. Several other such incidents involved officers from City West, Flemington and Carlton CIB.</B> <P>
<B><a name="cs19">CASE STUDY 19</a>. </B> <P>
<B>Not all reported incidents of police mistreatment concerned direct abuse to the complainant. One report described an incident in a Collingwood street where two police officers in a car had verbally abused a seventeen year old man in the street and then taken off, in the process of which they side-swiped a parked vehicle and drove off without stopping.</B> <P>
<B><a name="cs20">CASE STUDY 20</a>. </B> <P>
<B>One complainant reported that his shop was raided by more than 25 police officers in search of drugs, which resulted in extensive damage to the interior and structure of the building. He also reported that officers had shot dead his dogs during the raid. The complainant was not charged with any offence and has yet to receive any compensation for the damage incurred.</B> <P>
<B><a name="cs21">CASE STUDY 21</a>. </B> <P>
<B>Another complainant from Kensington reported that five police officers from the Major Crime Squad smashed down her front door at 4.30 in the morning with sledgehammers. As she stated in her report, she would have answered the door had they knocked. The complainant has also received no compensation despite the fact that no charges were laid.</B> <P>
<U><B>RESPONDENTS GENERAL COMMENTS RE: POLICE PRACTICES</B></U> <P>
<B>The survey forms offered the complainants an opportunity to make comments about the incident or police practices in general. </B> <P>
<B>i) One complainant commented that his experience with the police made him feel &quot;powerless and under the oppression of fascists&quot;. </B> <P>
<B>ii) Another complainant, originally from South America, had his door smashed down by a group of police who then assaulted him. He commented that he believed the Victoria police could be likened to the death squads in El Salvador.</B> <P>
<B>iii) Other complainants indicated that police mistreatment was a common occurrence, with comments such as &quot;this happens on a regular basis&quot;, and &quot;this is only one of the many experiences I have had with the police&quot;.</B> <P>
<B>iv) One complainant commented that he would never believe or trust the police again, whilst another commented that he would not advise his children to go to the police even if they were lost or in need of assistance. He added that he didn't feel that he could call the police in the event that he was the victim of a crime.</B> <P>
<B>v) One victim of police assault commented &quot;the police wonder why Walsh Street happened&quot;. Another simply said that he didn't think young people should be treated in such a manner. </B> <P>
<B>vi) Another said that he thought that the law should apply to the police in the same way that it applies to citizens.</B> <P>
<B>vii) Some complainants commented on how terrified they were of the police as a result of the incident. One complainant, concerned about the confidentiality of the survey, commented that if the officer involved knew that he was reporting the incident he would be shot, and that he did not expect to walk out of the police station next time, as he took threats to shoot him seriously. This man's report made numerous references to threats made to him by a particular officer from the St.Kilda CIB, and he was in genuine fear of his life. </B> <P>
<B>viii) Another complainant summed up the incident with...&quot;In all, it was a terrifying day and night, ... they seemed inhuman ...&quot; and described the incident as &quot;terrorism and a gross abuse of power&quot;.</B> <P>
<B>ix) Other complainants commented on their lack of faith in the complaints process. One commented that he felt that there were no avenues of complaint with any hope of success, whilst another said that he had made a complaint but there had been &quot;a big cover-up by Internal Investigations&quot;.</B> <P>
<B>x) One complainant who has an intellectual disability and was bashed by police reported that he was told by the officers involved that if he did not pursue the complaint &quot;nothing else would happen to him&quot;.</B> <P>
<B>xi) Another complainant, referring to a previous incident, reported that he had made an official complaint to I.I.D., but had been &quot;bullied and conned&quot; into retracting his complaint as part of a deal concerning the charges laid against him. He further commented that the officers involved reneged on the deal and that he was treated more harshly than if he hadn't complained in the first place.</B> <P>
<B>xii) Another complainant reported that she had made a complaint against the officers involved which was substantiated but which resulted in no disciplinary action against the officers involved. She commented that she was frustrated at the lack of action taken by the I.I.D., and as a result she would consider taking her own civil action against the officers in an attempt to achieve a remedy. </B> <P>
<B>xiii) Another complainant who had been subjected to continued harassment and racial abuse by an officer from Brunswick stated that he was concerned that if he made a formal complaint he would be on the end of a &quot;Chicago BYO&quot;, referring to the reputation of the Chicago police of planting drugs and carrying extra unregistered firearms. In short, he felt that he would be further victimised if he made a complaint.</B> <P>
<B>Several reported incidents involved the Transit Police. Most of these incidents involved abuse, intimidation and harassment of young people. </B> <P>
<B><A NAME="discussion">DISCUSSION</A><!--DISCUSSION--></B> <P>
<B>The information collected in this 1992 Federation of Community Legal Services survey accords with previous research. Although selection of respondents to the survey was unable to ensure that they represented the community or the population who interact with police or even the people who are mistreated by police, substantial similarities between all the studies undertaken in Victoria and elsewhere create a definite pattern of information about police misbehaviour and victims' responses to it.</B> <P>
<B>In particular, the survey data support assertions that those who become victims of police mistreatment are minority and powerless members of the community:</B> <P>
<B>- Between 70% and 80% of victims are men</B> <P>
<B>- At least 60% of victims are aged under 30 years</B> <P>
<B>- Most victims are not in the workforce. About 40% are unemployed and another 30% are students or pensioners </B> <P>
<B>- People with non English speaking backgrounds are over represented among victims who complain </B> <P>
<B>- Independent interpreters were not provided for 70% of victims who have difficulty with the English language.</B> <P>
<B>- Half of the victims have been previously mistreated by police </B> <P>
<B>- Only 20% of victims use formal report mechanisms such as the Internal Investigations Department of Victoria Police and the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints)</B> <P>
<B>- Fear of repercussions and cynicism about the usefulness of existing formal complaint systems are the most usual reason given for not formally reporting the incident. However, many victims remained ignorant of their right to complain despite Victoria Police Standing Orders which require Watch House Sergeants to provide this information </B> <P>
<B>- Up to 30% of victims were abused and detained without subsequent charges being laid. </B> <P>
<B>This survey exposes these general characteristics of victims of police abuse. The data indicate that most incidents involve several uniformed police officers of constable rank and that the incidents usually occur in police stations or private homes. In 12 cases, the Transit Police were involved. Analysis of individual incidents indicates that mistreatment by several police is not necessarily related to the strength and gender of the victim or refusal to cooperate.</B> <P>
<B>Mistreatment which occurs in police stations is more likely to inflict and result in physical injury, particularly bruising and broken bones. The frequency is not influenced by the victims, gender, age or language preference. In contrast, injuries inflicted at home are more likely to involve women and respondents aged over 25 years.</B> <P>
<B>The survey indicates that victims fear of reporting incidents through formal channels is greater in non English speakers. Comments made by some non English speakers indicates that this fear may be engendered by their perception of similarities in and their experiences with Australian police and those in their country of origin. Further, there is evidence that Anglo Australian cynicism about the formal complaints system is justified. In his report about the Queensland police Fitzgerald commented,</B> <P>
<B>&quot;Practical considerations both inhibit complaints against the police and help to ensure the observance of the code [that the law not be enforced against police]. Both honest police and civilians who report police misconduct risk serious detriment with little prospect of appropriate action.&quot; </B> <P>
<B>Evidence gathered in the course of this survey also supports another of Fitzgerald's findings that,</B> <P>
<B>&quot;Any person, who accuses or criticises a police officer also faces other, graver risks ranging from trumped up charges perhaps involving planted or fabricated evidence, to violence&quot;. </B> <P>
<B>The current system for making complaints against police is not taken seriously by violent police. Those who become victims of police attacks have little success in bringing those police officers involved to justice. Usually it is the word of the often more than one police officers involved against one individual. Police culture which places a higher value on &quot;sticking together&quot; is a significant factor to be reckoned with, and is a significant inhibitor to those deciding to make a complaint of police mistreatment. There are many issues to be considered when discussing police culture, in particular a value system where loyalty to the force often equals protection of fellow officers from investigation. It could be suggested that police complaints authorities need greater input into police recruitment and training policy and investigative and punitive powers to ensure deterrent effect. </B> <P>
<B>Further and somewhat ironically, even the Deputy Ombudsman (Police Complaints), who is responsible for monitoring police practices, and is uniquely placed to provide such information, fails to give full account of police practices. Palmer (1992) has argued that the Deputy Ombudsman's Annual Reports need to explain the results of his work rather than merely report them. In his most recent Annual Report, he even took to task critics of the process for handling police complaints while offering no hints about any limitations to the current system. Clearly, there is a divergence in the ways of understanding police complaints. </B> <P>
<B>Community Legal Centres believe that Victorian Police have progressively become more isolated and alienated from local communities. The very nature of a very large, highly mobile and transient force is undoubtably an important factor leading to this two way split. </B> <P>
<B>Attempts at community police liaison and developments such as police community consultative committees (P.C.C.C.) have generally not been successful. This may be because of the perception of local communities, which view these developments as police controlled public relations exercises rather than genuine attempts to develop accountability and dialogue with local communities. These local committees have never possessed any real decision making powers, and on occasions have been subject to directions higher in the police force quashing local community initiatives aimed at developing local accountability.</B> <P>
<B>There can be no substitute for the development of real dialogue and accountability of police to their local communities. What is needed is local management committees with real powers to direct the use of police resources available to their community, including the prioritising of police work in the prevention and detection of crime within that community.</B> <P>
<B>Clearly appropriate guidelines need to be established for the operation of community management structures for police. Much work needs to be done to ensure that these management committees are appropriately resourced. These committees should be provided with guidelines, developed in consultation with the community, that balance the need to protect individuals rights from unnecessary interference and arrest, against the need of the community to implement effective crime prevention and an adequate response when crime does occur.</B> <P>
<B>As of the present time no government in Victoria has yet addressed the widening gap between police and local communities. The future safety of our community requires a move away from police officers barricaded from the community by roller doors, high security fences, and motor vehicle windows two thirds closed. These images tell the community that the police do no trust the community and therefore are not to be trusted themselves.</B> <P>
<B>The development of local community management structures must not be left in the hands of the police force, but rather with the appropriate input from bodies such as the Law Reform Committees, Ethnic Communities, Womens Groups, Youth Organisations and local government to name a few of the obvious participants.</B> <P>
<B>More police, with more powers and more community alienating equipment is not the solution. More can be done with less in the area of Policing, what is really needed is a different style for achieving outcomes. What is required in Victoria is a radical rethink of the direction in which our police force is going and the way in which our police are held accountable to local communities. </B> <P>
<B>Under the current system, most complaints about police are investigated by police from the same district in which the officer complained about is stationed, under direction from the Internal Investigations Department or the Deputy Ombudsman. Whilst the task of this report was not to collect data on police investigation of complaints, it is worth noting that the experience of Community Legal Centres indicates that often police investigate those for whom they have a direct line of responsibility. </B> <P>
<B>Such a system may be a convenient means of investigating complaints but it undermines any confidence or faith an individual may have, particularly if they have been strip searched, beaten, confined and subsequently threatened with reprisals if they complained about their treatment. These circumstances regardless of the best intentioned motives of the investigators involved clearly compromises the independence of any subsequent investigation. It is imperative that a broad based, impartial, independent and well resourced police complaints mechanism be established.</B> <P>
<B>This survey indicates that community workers are more likely than the formal complaint system to receive complaints. Community Legal Centre workers have assisted clients who have been mistreated, falsely charged or harassed in making a complaint against police. The police and the Government seem unable to understand that the real issue underlying the low formal complaint rate of victims is distrust and fear of those to whom they must complain rather than unwillingness to complain per se. Therefore it is crucial that development of any new police complaints system include full community consultation.</B> <P>
<B>The development of an independent community visitors scheme with powers to randomly visit police stations, to protect the rights of individuals in custody is urgent. The establishment of independent community visitors schemes covering all police stations in Victoria is in the interests of the police, members of the public taken into police custody, and the Victorian community in general. </B> <P>
<B>An added benefit of such an approach if properly implemented is that of making the police directly accountable to the community that they are serving. Such measures have already been implemented in some parts of England. </B> <P>
