<p>
The Access Economics Investment Monitor records the value of publicly known investment projects. The value of listed projects in Victoria increased from $15.9 billion in March 1995 to $16.8 billion in March 1996, a rise of 6 per cent. 
<p>
Australian Bureau of Statistics data show that Victoria's business investment increased 9 per cent in 1995. The upturn included strong growth in manufacturing investment with nominal growth of 15 per cent in 1995 following an increase of 6 per cent in 1994.  Business surveys suggest investment is likely to grow strongly over the course of 1996.
