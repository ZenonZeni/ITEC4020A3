<H1>DYNAMIC AND COMPOSITION OF THE RADIOACTIVE RELEASE</H1>
<HR>
The study of radioactive release during the Chernobyl accident is the  
subject of a considerable number of works <A HREF = "sources.html">[1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 11-14, 16-18]</A>. 
However, basic actual data on release of radionuclides during the active  
stage of the accident was mainly given in  
<A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>. 
<P>
<A HREF = "frelleg.gif"><IMG SRC  = "frel0m.gif">The final picture</A> 
was first presented to world community in report by <A HREF = "legasov.gif">academician V.A.Legasov</A> with 
co-authors at the <B>IAEA</B> session in <B>August 1986</B> and has not been reconsidered 
since then. 
<HR> 
     During the process of the accident the nuclear fuel from  the 
destroyed reactor was subjected to high temperature and mechanical 
failure. Heating up to the temperatures  of  about  <B>2000 C</B>  caused 
complete or partial evaporation of volatile radioactive elements 
from the fuel.  A  part  of  the  fuel  was  released  during  the 
explosion  in  the  form   of   fine-dispersed   component   which 
distributed in the atmosphere. Subsequent fires and  natural  fuel 
heating by radioactive decay caused  that  hot  air  continued  to 
carry out  of  the  reactor  the  products  of  graphite  burning, 
radioactive gases, aerosols, and  fine-dispersed  fuel  dust  with 
dimensions of particles from parts of a micron to  tens  and  even 
hundreds micron. 
<P> 
     Thus,  radioactive  releases  from  the   destroyed   reactor 
consisted of at least two different components: 
<UL> 
<LI> radioactive  nuclides  included  into  the  matrix  of  the 
dispersed fuel and released in the form of radioactive dust, 
<LI> separate volatile radioactive substances  in  the  form  of 
gases or aerosols, which evaporated from the hot fuel. 
</UL> 
The detail description of different radioactive release characteristics is divided 
on the following parts: 
<UL> 
<LI><A HREF = "rnucrel1.html">General characteristics and evaluation of radioactive release</A>. 
<LI><A HREF = "nucrel2.html">New data on radioactive release</A>. 
</UL> 
<P> 
According to estimations, during the accident: 
<UL> 
<LI>inert gases came out of the destroyed reactor completely <A HREF = "sources.html">[1.2]</A>; 
<LI>iodine-131 release was 50-60%, which is 40-60 MCi (on the average, 45 MCi) as of 26 April 1986, 
<A HREF = "sources.html#3"</A>[3, 4, 5, 16, 17]</A>; 
<LI>cesium release was (33 +/- 0.7)MCi; 
<LI>strontium release was about 4%, or 0.2 MCi <A HREF = "sources.html">[1]</A>; 
<LI>fuel release outside the plant area was (3.5 +/- 0.5)% <A HREF = "sources.html">[1, 4, 5]</A>. 
</UL> 
<P> 
Besides, some general remarks can be made: 
<UL> 
<LI>In the modelling of radionuclide transport at the Chernobyl accident one should differ the fuel and volatile components, and the transport of relatively refractory fuel component can be described by local and mesoscale models, whereas volatile (cesium and iodine) component require attraction of global transport models; 
<LI>the considerable release of radionuclides could continue even after 5 May 1986.
