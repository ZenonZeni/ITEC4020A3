How DARE they! :) </p>

<p> Date: 13 May 1995 05:54:34 GMT </p>

<p> DARE also has a big problem passing misinformation. I've
personally heard them tell kids that recreational drugs are far
more dangerous and KILL more people than alcohol! That's just not
fact... </p>

<p> A few years ago my niece turned her father in for pot after
being interrogated by DARE officers in the principle' s office at
her school in a very small town. My niece claims they told her
that her parents had a </p>

<p> crack problem. She claims all she said was that she knew her
parents smoked pot in college and once she thought she smelled it
at home. Being a small town ... they ran out and got a search
warrant and searched their home and their two adjoining home
businesses a beauty salon and a green house/nursery. After
ripping apart their home and businesses they found nothing! </p>

<p> But the trauma of being told their daughter turned them in
for crack and having their home torn apart with about 6 officers
in front of their neighbors has about destroyed that family and
their businesses. They are reluctant to pursue a lawsuit because
their daughter is involved &amp; they'd like to put it behind
them. </p>

<p> Thanks Dare!. <br>
