<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Threats:</STRONG> <I>Poverty and slash-and-burn agriculture.</I>




<P>
Perhaps nowhere on earth does biological largesse contrast more
starkly with economic distress than in Madagascar.  This island
nation harbors unique biodiversity.  For instance, while Madagascar
occupies less than two percent of Africa's land mass, more than
80 percent of Madagascar's plants and an even higher proportion
of animals are endemic-- occurring nowhere else on the planet.

</STRONG>
</CENTER><P>
Despite this biological wealth, the people of Madagascar live
in extreme poverty, with an average per capita income is only
$190 a year.  Poor people often have no choice but to slash and
burn the forest for subsistence agriculture, charcoal production,
and hunting.   As much as 80 percent of the original Malagasy
forest is already felled.  One of the top three hotspots on the
planet, Madagascar is facing the possibility of mass extinctions.

<P>
CI's COEFOR project addresses Madagascar's extensive
forests that stand outside their protected area system, the so-called
classified forests, that serve as watersheds and protectors of
biodiversity as well as providing timber, medicinal plants, and
other products for local use.  Through the COEFOR project, CI
is now leading a new wave of forest management by helping residents
establish model community management plans.  In 1995, after CI's
conservation priority-setting workshop, the government of Madagascar
placed COEFOR's priority reserves at the top of its environmental
agenda.

In 1995, CI published the first
of its Tropical Field Guide series, <U>Lemurs of Madagascar</U>.  Heading
the group of scientists who compiled this volume is CI President
and primatologist, Russell A. Mittermeier.  This guide is designed
to attract ecotourists to Madagascar and engage them in &quot;watching&quot;
and &quot;life-listing&quot; other creatures in addition to birds.
 In the long run, this guide on Madagascar's unique primate species
-- and the guides on other species to follow -- will expand the
audience of nature enthusiasts in the discovery, study, and conservation
of tropical wildlife. 

<P>
Also in this turning-point
year of 1995, the former head of CI's Madagascar program founded
the country's first environmental NGO--named FANAMBY, taken from
the title of CI's award-winning video about Madagascar's ecology:
&quot;Fanamby: Green Challenge for the Red Island.

<H4> Zahamena Integral Reserve </H4>

<P>
In 1995, CI's work continued on the Zahamena
Integral Reserve in northeast Madagascar.  We are helping stem
encroachment on the reserve with a variety of community conservation
and development projects, including boosting farm yields.  CI
has set up an endowment to finance the project long-term, starting
with a debt-for-nature swap that generated more than $1 million
in local currency. 

<P>
In late 1995, CI organized a novel monitoring
project, using digital, high-altitude photography and videography
from a small plane.  The images, keyed into the Geographical Information
System (GIS), will allow analysts to see just what use is being
made of the reserve, and where.  The precise aerial photography
will also enable CI to confirm reports that forest encroachment
has greatly decreased since CI's projects began.

<P>
<H4>Ankarafantsika
Reserve Complex </H4>

<P>The Ankarafantsika Reserve contains critical watershed
terrain for the nation's second largest rice-growing center. 
Because of deforestation, though, rivers running down from Ankarafantsika
into the rice fields are increasingly loaded with sandy silt,
which chokes off young rice shoots.  Yields of rice, the country's
staple food, have been falling.  In 1995, CI secured a major grant
from German Development Aid (KfW) for its project, largely on
the basis of our work at Zahamena. For the past two years, CI
has been working to protect the reserve by helping raise incomes
in an environmentally sustainable way for people living in and
around the reserve.  Efforts are underway to reduce the use of
fire and clear-cutting in the region, which in turn will reduce
soil run-off into the rice paddies below and help ensure a stable
rice crop. </BLOCKQUOTE>
