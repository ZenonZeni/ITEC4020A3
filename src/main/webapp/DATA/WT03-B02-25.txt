First Choice PPO, Group Health HMO to Bid Jointly on CHAMPUS Pact


In an action that could set an industry precedent, PPO First
Choice Health Network and HMO Group Health Cooperative of Puget
Sound are teaming up to bid on the giant CHAMPUS contract for
Washington state and Oregon, THE PPO LETTER has learned.

"We think we complement each other far more than we compete,"
says First Choice President and CEO Clayton Field. And Field
suggests that such joint marketing efforts may become common in
the future as "part of the maturity of the industry."

It is possible, he says, that First Choice, Washington's largest
PPO with about 300,000 covered lives, and Group Health Coopera-
tive, the state's largest HMO with 470,000 enrollees, might
cooperate in bidding for other public and private pacts later.

To date, joint ventures involving PPOs and HMOs have been ex-
tremely rare. The only one involving large organizations recently
occurred in Minneapolis, where PPO Preferred One agreed in 1991
to lease its provider network to HMO GroupCare, a unit of Group
Health, to offer clients more flexible benefit options (THE PPO
LETTER, 9/2/91, p. 4).

It was a similar need - in the form of the new federal
mandate to offer a "triple option (i.e., HMO, PPO, and indemnity)
- in managed-care programs for the Civilian Health and
Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) that helped
bring together First Choice and Group Health Cooperative.

The Washington-Oregon CHAMPUS Reform Initiative (CRI) contract,
for which bids are due in mid-January 1993, covers a whopping
250,000 military dependents and retirees. The current pact does
not contain managed-care features and expires in early 1994.

Given the "mega-big" nature of the contract and the fact that
"one vendor would be responsible for the risk and care," Group
Health Cooperative decided "no one plan can absorb that," ex-
plains Peter Brumleve, vice president of marketing for the HMO.

While many of the requirements of the contract were "right up our
alley," include utilization management, quality assurance, cost
containment, and a large number of network providers, Brumleve
says, one wasn't. "We're not a PPO," he notes, and since the
contract specifications mandate a PPO option, the HMO decided "we
need a PPO."

He says Group Health Cooperative looked at the PPOs available and
soon focused on First Choice. Like First Choice, the 45-year-old
staff-model HMO is not for profit. Moreover, the two Seattle-
based organizations and their CEOs, Field and Phil Nudelman, had
longstanding relationships "that facilitated negotiations," says
Brumleve.

The HMO went on to fill another contract requirement, claims
processing, by recruiting as a bid partner Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of South Carolina. That organization, the CHAMPUS fiscal
intermediary for the mid-Atlantic region, is well regarded for
CHAMPUS claims administration (THE PPO LETTER, 8/10/92, p. 2).

Brumleve says the group also will have other partners, but he
won't identify them yet since arrangements haven't been final-
ized. He acknowledges that the partners expect to face consider-
able competition for the one-year pact (with four one-year
renewal options) slated to start February 1994, based on atten-
dance at the bidders' meeting held this year.

But regardless of whether the group wins the contract, the
cooperative effort has major implications for the future. Terming
the relationship "synergistic" and "good and getting better,"
Brumleve says it is "definitely possible" that Group Health
Cooperative and First Choice could team up for other pacts,
although it's "too early to tell."

The chances of such arrangements are growing especially since CRI
contracts are like other large ones increasingly being discussed
at both public and private levels that involve risk and account-
ability for cost and quality, he says. He cites as examples the
purchasing cooperatives in Minnesota that are awarding single
contracts covering several customers.

Teamwork between PPOs and HMOs hasn't occurred much before, he
asserts, because there haven't been opportunities - or needs
- to do this previously. The joint bid on the CHAMPUS pact
"will be a learning experience for our organization and for the
industry," adds Brumleve.

"This is the right way to go," agrees Field. It's clear now, he
says, that HMOs are trying to loosen up (e.g., allowing more
flexibility) at the same time that PPOs are trying to tighten up
in areas such as medical management. Thus, there's a need for
change, but "we're in an era where it seems foolish to invent a
new HMO or PPO," he maintains.

"If you have them out there, why not go together?" he asks. He
argues that the public is better served in this way, and PPOs and
HMOs have increased "buying power" if they collaborate to assure
doctors significantly more patients. It also eases administrative
problems, Field says, since, for instance, a Taft-Hartley entity
has to deal with only one managed care firm.

Such cooperation hasn't occurred often before since "there's been
a perception that PPOs and HMOs compete," Field notes. This is
partly true, he says, since they each may solicit the same
company for contracts. But there invariably are some employees
who want only an HMO or only a PPO, so "it's an advantage" to be
able to offer both.

The trend, says Field, is toward the kind of "managed competi-
tion" model now popular in both the Democratic and Republican
party camps. He adds it's "ironic" that the government, in the
form of the huge CRI pact, was responsible for leading organiza-
tions such as First Choice and Group Health Cooperative to this
new kind of teamwork.

22 Companies Offer New Medicare SELECT Plans, HCFA Survey Shows

An informal and limited survey conducted by the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA) indicates that a total of 22
companies are offering plans under the new Medicare SELECT
program in 10 of the 15 designated states.

The survey, sent out in late August and just tabulated, also
shows that seven additional companies have SELECT proposals
awaiting approval in the same plus one other state, which HCFA
declines to identify.

But two of the designated states, Oregon and Michigan, have
withdrawn from the program, and replacement states probably won't
be named until early next year, according to HCFA.

Medicare SELECT, which began operation July 1, enables Medicare
supplemental insurance (Medigap) carriers to offer retirees a
fee-for-service preferred provider network. A principal attrac-
tion is that employers can buy Medicare SELECT plans at prices
15% to 25% lower than they paid for previous conventional Medigap
policies.

But there are some restrictions. The policies offered must be
selected from the 10 specific ones described by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and must include
the basic plan A. And no other new Medigap policies may be
offered in the participating states.

The HCFA survey did not attempt to find out which of the nine
other plans were being offered or how many beneficiaries are
being covered. It did show SELECT policies are available in
Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missou-
ri, North Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.

That indicates no SELECT policies were being offered as of the
time of the survey in two of the biggest states, California and
Ohio, as well as in Washington state. Oft-proposed legislation to
extend the SELECT program to all 50 states died in a House-Senate
conference committee this year. It is expected to be reintroduced
in 1993.

Despite the relatively limited initial use of the pilot program,
which runs through 1994, HCFA expects other companies to begin
offering SELECT policies in the designated states soon.

One major trigger for that may be the long-delayed approval of
"safe harbor" provisions for the SELECT plans. They would allow
SELECT PPOs to get discounts from providers and waive copayments
for only the Medicare beneficiaries who use these providers
without running afoul of Medicare's anti-kickback rules. That
might help overcome the current lack of interest among many PPOs
in the over-65 market.

A Department of Health and Human Services source says those safe-
harbor provisions - along with others eagerly awaited by PPOs
for non-SELECT plans to protect their payment arrangements -
probably won't be out until late November at the earliest.

The reason for the delays, the source says, aside from the
relatively recent addition of the SELECT provisions, is that the
rules need the blessing of the Office of Management and Budget.

There also have been managed-care industry concerns, communicated
to federal policy makers, that the planned safe-harbor rules were
too narrow and leave too much regulatory authority to the states,
which often do not have mechanisms for overseeing PPOs.

Safe-harbor worries notwthstanding, one Medicare SELECT market
participant sees a bright future for the plans.

SELECT will become "more and more significant" in the future
since the over-65 population is growing and becoming more accus-
tomed to preferred provider arrangements, says Debbie Ahl, execu-
tive vice president of Olympic Health Management Systems, Inc.
(Bellingham, Wash.).

Olympic is a health-care consulting firm and third-party admin-
istrator specializing since 1986 in Medigap and now SELECT plans.
The company is marketing SELECT policies underwritten by Sierra
Health & Life in Texas, where it knows of only one other company
(Humana) competing for that business, according to Greg Brethour,
vice president of sales.

Ahl, however, says she's not surprised by that since SELECT is a
"brand new concept." She declines to say in what other SELECT
states Olympic is active.

But she does say there is a consensus in the industry that NAIC-
designated plans C and F will be the dominant SELECT policies.
Plan C pays the 20% Medicare Parts A and B coinsurance based on
the Medicare-allowable fees, while Plan F covers 100% of physi-
cian charges.

SouthCare Adds 11 Hospitals to Establish Statewide PPO Network

SouthCare Medical Alliance, which has been a provider-owned PPO
in the Atlanta area since its establishment in 1985, will have a
statewide hospital network by the end of the year. The PPO has
signed up nine not-for-profit hospitals outside metropolitan
Atlanta (11 overall) as affiliates during the past three months,
says President and CEO Larry L. Madlem.

Moreover, Madlem says, SouthCare expects to start contracting
with physicians affiliated with these hospitals in 1993. By
completion in 1994, the PPO will boost by about 1,200 its current
1,300-physician network, he adds.

SouthCare, which now has 16 hospitals in its network, thereby
apparently will become the first statewide provider-owned PPO in
Georgia. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia now has a state-
wide network, as does investor-owned Affordable Health Concepts,
a unit of HealthCare COMPARE.

The expansion push for SouthCare outside metropolitan Atlanta
began in the Savannah area and includes hospitals generally in
the 400- to 500-bed size range, according to Madlem.

The additions are Douglas General Hospital (Douglasville),
Egleston Children's Hospital at Emory University (Atlanta), Floyd
Medical Center (Rome), Northeast Georgia Medical Center (Gaines-
ville), Paulding Memorial Medical Center (Dallas), Peach County
Hospital (Fort Valley), Rockdale Hospital (Conyers), Saint
Joseph's Hospital (Savannah), Scottish Rite Children's Medical
Center (Atlanta), The Medical Center of Central Georgia (Macon),
and University Hospital (Augusta).

Madlem says several factors resulted in the decision to go
statewide. Among them were the requests of some of SouthCare's
major customers, including The Principal Financial Group and
Mutual of Omaha, he says. Others that have contracted for state-
wide access include employers Waffle House and Home Depot.

The "changing dynamics" in the legislative and political arenas
also spurred the statewide expansion, Madlem adds. He explains
that SouthCare wants to be able to bid on Medicare and Medicaid
as well as large private provider-network contracts that will
become more prevalent.

There is an industry trend, he says, toward consolidation,
bringing more and more coverage under a single contract largely
to save on expense from a time and personnel standpoint.

"We didn't feel we had much time left to be viable in the market
as just a metropolitan area PPO" as SouthCare was before, asserts
Madlem. To remain competitive, he says, the PPO needed to become
broader in the services it offers (including adding mental
health, workers' compensation, and utilization review), and "we
needed to be at least statewide."

SouthCare now claims to be Georgia's largest managed care organi-
zation with 366,390 covered lives as of last month and more than
1,300 doctors in its directory. A handful of physicians, as well
as 11 hospitals, were its original owners.

New York Life Chooses PHC to Provide Mental Health Networks

New York Life Insurance Co., fulfilling a pledge early this year
that it would hire a nationwide mental-health services vendor
rather than handle this specialty in house, said October 20 that
Preferred Health Care Ltd. (PHC) will be its provider.

The agreement, which New York Life predicts will cover 525,000
lives by 1995, offers major pluses for both firms.

New York Life, which has been rolling out a whole range of new
provider-network products (THE PPO LETTER, 1/13/92, p. 1), gains
the aid of a proven developer and manager of mental-health
networks. It does that at less cost than if it had developed a
program from scratch or acquired a behavioral-health specialist
such as insurers CIGNA, The Travelers, and Aetna have done.

PHC (Wilton, Conn.), which has built its reputation and much of
its business providing services directly to self-funded Fortune
500 employers, gains enhanced access to the insured, smaller-
employer market through an alliance with a huge carrier.

Under the contract, PHC will support mental-health components of
a wide range of New York Life's managed care products, including
PPOs and managed indemnity.

The agreement calls for it to furnish provider networks, case
evaluation, patient referral, utilization review, claims review,
and management reporting and analysis. Those services will not be
provided in "southern New York State," where New York Life says
its Sanus HMO subsidiary will continue to furnish managed mental
health care to clients.

"Our unique affiliation with New York Life will provide nation-
wide access to managed mental health services for small and mid-
size businesses," says David McDonnell, chairman and CEO of PHC.
He calls that an "expanding segment" in the managed mental health
market.

PHC, founded in 1983, now covers seven million people in managed
behavioral health and workers' compensation services. It has been
been boosting stakes aggressively in both businesses this year,
most recently in the latter by agreeing to buy the stock of
Adjustco Inc., a third-party administrator primarily in workers'
comp.

In its most recent financial report, for the quarter that ended
June 30, PHC posted net income from continuing operations of 10
cents a share, up from 4 cents a share in the comparable year-ago
period. Revenues climbed to $13.3 million from $9.3 million.

New York Life has introduced an exclusive provider organization
(EPO) this year and continued its rollout of second-generation
PPO products designed for employee groups of up to 3,000 covered
lives.

In unveiling its mental-health strategy early this year, Vice
President for Managed Care Dr. Dan Fishbein pointed to the
efficiency of using an established vendor rather than "reinvent
the wheel." Fishbein added then, "It's not a carve-out. We're
assuming risk."

Admar Acquires Two TPAs As Part of EPO "Evolution" Move

The Admar Group, which started out as a third-party administrator (TPA) in
California before becoming a PPO operator, has come full circle. The Santa
Ana, Calif.-based managed care firm acquired two TPAs in Colorado to support
its planned operation of an exclusive provider organization (EPO) there.

"We're evolving into an EPO organization," says Richard Toral, CEO of Admar.
Because of the need for its own administration to support the more intensive
data requirements of an EPO than of a PPO, he explains, the company agreed to
purchase Boulder, Colo.-based TPAs Benefit Plan Administrators and Hofgard &
Co. for a total of $1.6 million in cash and notes.

He says the additional administrative capability will aid the marketing of
the EPO, which Admar plans to start in Colorado in the first quarter of 1993.
Admar already has PPOs in the state, but Toral says the company has no plans
to start an HMO there.

An HMO isn't necessary in Colorado, according to Toral, since Admar can
"equal the performance of an HMO with an indemnity-based product."

Admar, which also plans an EPO in southern California and is in the midst of
rapid PPO expansion in several states (THE PPO LETTER, 9/21/92, p. 1),
expects the major portion of its growth to come internally, Toral says. He
adds, however, that further acquisitions are a "possibility."

The firm recently agreed to furnish an 18-state preferred provider network
for National Insurance Services (Tampa), thereby adding 100,000 covered lives
and anticipated first-year revenues of $1 million from the PPO and
utilization management provisions of the contract.

The growth, however, is coming at a price. The company posted a net loss of
$296,000 or 4 cents a share in the fiscal second quarter, which ended July
31, compared with net income of $57,000 (less than one cent a share) in the
year-ago period as revenues climbed 12% to $2.8 million from $2.5 million.
Part of the reason for the decline in the bottom line, Admar says, is an
increase in marketing expenditures.

CHAMPUS Northern Region Rebidding Offers New Market for PPOs

Adhering to mandates contained in the new law that resolved a
stalemate (THE PPO LETTER, 6/29/92, p. 1), the Department of
Defense is seeking bids that include a PPO option for the first
time for the 19-state Northern Region CHAMPUS contract.

The huge contract contains the requirement, included in the
Request for Proposals (RFP), that "all network providers shall
discount rates at least 5% below the CHAMPUS allowable amount."
The PPO also must include retail pharmacies as well as hospitals
and physicians.

Proposals on the one-year pact (with four one-year renewal
options), which is a "rebid" of a contract that did not previous-
ly have a managed-care network component, are due November 18. A
bidders' meeting was held in Denver September 23.

The Northern Region solicitation is the third of four major
contracts up for grabs with the Civilian Health and Medical
Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) that involve the
CHAMPUS Reform Initiative (CRI) style of managed care.

The others are the controversial rebid California-Hawaii pact
(THE PPO LETTER, 8/10/92, p. 1), a Washington-Oregon contract now
out for proposals (see article, page 1), and a Florida pact for
which the RFP still is in development, according to Commander Tom
Corrato, director of cooordinated care operations for CHAMPUS.

There also are smaller projects, to be set up by next May, linked
with military-base closure sites in Austin and Dallas-Fort Worth,
Tex. and Alexandria, La.

The Northern Region contract, though, dwarfs all the others in
terms of sheer size of area covered. It covers the states of
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky (except
the Ft. Campbell "catchment area"), Maine, Massachusetts, Michi-
gan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wiscon-
sin.

Its managed care "task" includes an enrolled HMO-like plan, using
a "gatekeeper"-like Primary Care Manager, as well as the PPO.
There are stringent network access mandates for bidders as well
as a requirement that "PPO networks shall continuously operate in
all areas" where "sufficient beneficiary population exists."

The PPO developer would have to show why it is not cost-effective
to implement a network within any of the areas. It also would
have to document efforts to contract with providers there.

The RFP states that no payment may be required for a noncovered
service from a network provider unless the beneficiary has agreed
in advance to pay for such service.

The PPO benefit plan design calls for a beneficiary copayment for
most outpatient services of 15% of the fee negotiated by the
contractor for active-duty (AD) families and 20% for retirees and
their families. For ambulatory surgery, there is no copayment
for AD and 20% for retirees.

On hospitalization, there is no copayment for AD families. For
retirees and dependents, the copayment requirement is $125 per
day or 25% of total charges (based on fee schedules negotiated by
the contractor), whichever is less, for "institutional services"
plus 20% of "separately billed professional charges."

For mental illness and alcoholism treatment, the RFP for the PPO
plan calls for no copayment for AD families. For retiree fami-
lies, the "cost share" is $50 per day or 25% of total charges
(based on negotiated fee schedules), whichever is less, for
institutional services plus 20% of separately billed professional
charges.

While Corrato says "there is a push for us" to develop mail-order
pharmacy plans for CHAMPUS health-care programs, there is no
mail-order requirement in the Northern Region RFP. A pilot of
such a plan is salted to be tried in Hawaii.

Spiegel Looks to Add Physician, POS Networks to Successful PPO

Spiegel Inc., which began using a hospital-only PPO network in
1989, is "leaning toward" adding the physician portion of that
network next year, says Michael Tulaga, benefits and compensation
director. And Tulaga says the company might develop a point-of-
service (POS) plan in 1994.

The Downers Grove, Ill.-based specialty retailer, which spent
$16.3 million on employee health care (excluding a couple of
subsidiaries) in 1991, says it saved more than $1.1 million
through using the 52-hospital network of Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Illinois. That compares with savings of about $300,000
in 1989 and $600,000 in 1990.

The high savings in 1991, according to Tulaga, result not only
directly from the approximately 20% discounts the network pro-
vides but also from the fact that 80% of eligible employees now
use the network for hospitalization.

He attributes the high usage partly to the concentration of the
company's employees (4,000 out of 5,000) in the well-networked
Chicago area. "Employees don't have to go far to [preferred]
providers," Tulaga says.

Another factor, though, is plan design, he asserts. Spiegel
reworked its overall employee benefits when the PPO option was
introduced to give employees a flexible structure in which they
could choose from three different levels of health-insurance
coverage.

A thorough employee communications effort also has helped. Small
staff meetings explaining the benefit changes with the aid of
slides or videos were accompanied by education about the causes
and effects of rising health costs.

Together with written materials, Spiegel says, the effort helped
reverse a prior (before the PPO) lukewarm feeling surveyed
employees displayed toward the company's health benefits.

Having made its first limited move into managed care from the
previous indemnity plan, which still covers about 1,000 employees
outside the Chicago area, Tulaga says, the self-insured company
now wants to go further.

He says the physician network "could be our next step." But
Spiegel also is looking into developing a POS plan with HMO and
indemnity components in 1994 "to help manage overall costs," he
adds. The company now has HMOs only for hourly employees and just
since this year.

PHCS Uses Quality-Based Ranking System to Evaluate PPO Providers

Preferred Healthcare Systems, Inc. (PHCS) is using a quality-based evaluation
system to rank its 63,500 PPO providers and to make retention and patient
"redirection" decisions, according to Dr. N. Stephen Ober, vice president and
corporate medical director.

Preliminary results of the system, Ober told a session of the American
Managed Care and Review Association annual conference in San Diego October
20, show 90% of the physicians examined ranked in the top two categories.
This is a similar result, and indeed the system is similar to that used by
unrelated mental-health PPO Preferred Health Care Ltd. in provider profiling
(THE PPO LETTER, 9/21/92, p. 7).

But the PHCS system generated several questions from attendees about use of
the findings. The Lexington, Mass.-based PPO, Ober responded to a couple of
them, shares some of the information with its employer clients but does not
make results available to patients, partly because of liability
considerations.

And it doesn't report "incidents" of inappropriate care to the government, he
noted, partly because PPOs aren't allowed to access the National Practitioner
Data Bank.

The preliminary findings, he said, showed that 16.7% of its network
physicians accounted for all the incidents found, and only 2.7% of the
doctors examined had five or more incidents. About 30% of the physicians
ranked in the top category and are being rewarded by gaining referrals of
patients who call the PHCS "hotline" for assistance.

Ober said the system depends on using a large amount of data on physicians'
practice patterns over time to obtain "meaningful" and comprehensive clinical
information on the providers. The idea is to assess the quality of the
physician, not just that of the care provided, he added.

The raw data used in the system include medical and pharmaceutical claims,
utilization review results, patient surveys, and "administrative reports"
(often "ad hoc" documents filed by PHCS' field staff). Using a computerized
method and physician reviewers, the data are looked at for indicators of
performance.

The "indicators" are in several areas. Patient satisfaction information comes
from surveys and administrative reports. The reports also provide raw
material for an indicator of administrative efficiency, which takes into
account such findings as "upcoding" and claims unbundling. Indicators of
outcomes of care come from both administrative reports and from data on post-
procedure complications.

Moreover, the "process of care" is examined, according to Ober, for such
deficiencies as inappropriate use of assistant surgeons, "procedure/diagnosis
mismatch," outmoded procedures, and "therapeutic overlap" in the drugs
prescribed.


In the second phase of the process, PHCS does a "targeted review" using
"relative weighting of incidents" to examine "targeted outlier providers" to
get a "provider quality score," Ober said. He explained that quality ratings
of 3 to 5 in this phase involve "deviations in practice patterns" with a 5
indicating "major deviations."

The final phase involves "provider intervention." After using its medical-
director and quality-assurance subcommittees to arrive at a consensus on what
to do, PHCS discusses its findings with the targeted providers and gets
"feedback" from them.

Those who receive a score of 3 get an inquiry letter, are asked for
additional "general information" and "educated" about PHCS quality management
processes. A 4 score gets the provider a warning letter, a request for
additional specific information, and an "evaluation." A score of 5, said
Ober, results in termination from the network, although there is an appeal
procedure.

In the preliminary results, only 1% of the physicians received a 5 score,
while 4% had a 4, 5% a 3, 60% a 2, and 30% a 1.

Ober said the system should be usable for any contracted network, especially
since it utilizes commonly available data and doesn't require a huge data
base. The "multiple interventions," which focus on non-punitive actions, he
said, broaden the impact of the system.

In response to questions, he said the system can detect underutilization as
well as overutilization and can even pinpoint when physicians are not
administering needed periodic immunizations. But he acknowledged that PHCS
doesn't yet have the means to use this system for examination of physicians'
referral patterns.

Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,

The Sept. 21, 1992 issue of THE PPO LETTER somewhat misrepresent-
ed my comments regarding [American] Biodyne's provider network
made at the recent Behavioral Health Tomorrow conference in
Chicago.

It is not Biodyne's goal to narrow its current network. Rather,
we are committed to developing and maintaining the highest
quality networks. This necessitates a process of selection which
tends to result in a more refined network which is traditional
for managed care companies. We want to ensure that our patients
are treated by the most qualified providers available and that
these providers receive valuable support from Biodyne.

We are not looking to reward efficiency. We are looking to reward
clinical effectiveness and high quality service. Our unending
commitment to this goal will guarantee that our provider networks
are strong and that our patients receive the most clinically
appropriate care possible.

Jeffrey I. Bragman, Ph.D.
Vice President, Quality Management and Clinical Services
American Biodyne, Inc.
South San Francisco, Calif.

Specialized Needs of Retirees Said to Create PPO Opportunities

While managed health care for retirees remains largely an HMO
rather than PPO emphasis, there is potential for substantially
more provider network activity, particularly in specialty areas.
And those opportunities, which some employers already are taking
advantage of, could rise if proposed legislation is enacted.

That, at least, appeared to be the consensus of speakers at a
conference on managing health care for retirees, sponsored by the
Washington Business Group on Health, in Washington, D.C. last
month.

The biggest component of retiree managed care now is Medicare
risk contracting. About 100 HMOs (no PPOs) participate in that
program, which involves Medicare paying the HMOs 95% of its
average per-capita cost in return for providing at least Medi-
care's standard level of benefits.

But there are relatively untapped options for PPOs, even aside
from the new Medicare SELECT program (see article, page 1). These
areas especially involve "younger retirees," not Medicare eligi-
ble, who usually can be "leveraged" into existing networks, said
Dr. Saul Spivack, a consultant with Tillinghast in New York.

Some of the opportunities, Spivack said, lie in specialized areas
that reflect the different health conditions and performance
expectations of retirees as well as their geographical disper-
sion. He saw a need for "subnetworks" in such specialties as
cardiac, musculoskeletal/orthopedic, cancer, organic brain
disorders, neurology, and multidisciplinary diagnostics.

For these networks to be successful, he contended, utilization
management must be a high priority. It should include prospective
identification of high risk/high cost retirees, retroactive
evaluation of emergency admissions, and on-site concurrent
reviews.

For younger retirees, regular PPOs are a feasible option for
employers, according to Spivack. His findings are supported by an
Intracorp survey, conducted this summer, which showed 51% of
responding employers used PPOs for pre-Medicare eligible retir-
ees, compared with only 24% for Medicare eligible retirees.

For the older retirees, Spivack suggested point-of-service (POS)
plans of a "soft" nature that pull enrollees through "perceived
value" rather than through cutting benefits.

Medicare has proposed legislation for retiree POS programs along
these lines, pointed out Edmund C. Moy, director of the office of
coordinated care policy and planning at the U.S. Health Care
Financing Administration.


The plan, not acted on by Congress this year, would involve the
government renting an employer's existing POS network for its
retirees to get continuity and "not reinvent the wheel," Moy
said. A lure for retirees, he explained, would be that network
beneficiaries get higher benefits than they would under Medicare.

While that proposal seems unlikely to get action soon, some
corporations have taken their own actions involving PPOs for
retirees. One is Chrysler Corporation. Its financial staff
specialist for health care planning, Christopher Mykrantz, told
the conference that the automaker has successfully employed
several directly contracted specialty PPOs for retirees.

All of these PPOs use capitated rate payments. A podiatry PPO,
started in Michigan in 1986 and extended regionally in 1991,
saved 40% the first year and now is limiting the annual cost
increase trend to 1.8%.

A laboratory PPO, also begun in Michigan in 1986, expanded in
1992 to other states, Mykrantz said. It saved 30% the first year,
and the cost-hike trend since then has been 1.9%. There also are
new prescription-drug and durable-medical-equipment PPOs that are
off to good starts, according to Mykrantz.

PPOs Expected to Participate in New AMCRA Healthcare Database

Having completed its technical and financial feasibility analysis with
favorable results, the AMCRA Healthcare Database (AHD) now is beginning a
two-year development phase in which 250 additional managed care plans will
participate.

Those participants will include PPOs as well as HMOs, says Howard Fomby, a
principal in Prolifix, the Lenexa, Kan. firm putting together the huge data
base. He predicted that 400 plans will be participating when AHD begins
actual, self-sufficient operation in 1995.

Fomby updated the status and business plan for AHD at a session of the
American Managed Care and Review Association (AMCRA) annual conference in San
Diego Oct. 19. AMCRA commissioned the project in 1988 as a means of
quantifying the impact of managed care in such areas as cost, utilization,
and quality of care.

A more specific set of objectives involves aiding managed care plans in
evaluating utilization management, predicting revenue requirements, and
reporting data to clients and regulators. Some of these objectives overlap
those of the American Accreditation Program Inc., the PPO-industry plan that
has published similar summary information about its approximately 25
accredited PPOs.

AHD obtained funding and management aid for its pilot phase from Marion
Merrell Dow, Fomby's former employer, in 1991.

The just-completed pilot included data from six HMOs selected on the basis of
diversity of hardware, software, and type of plans. One of them, which Fomby
declined to identify, also submitted PPO data. He did say PPOs will be
invited to be full participants in AHD, which started out as an HMO-only
project.

Previous unsuccessful private and public efforts to create a comprehensive
data base have been plagued by fragmentation and insufficient participation
by individual plans. Their problems, said Robert Thompson, a Health Care
Horizons, Inc. vice president who chairs AMCRA's data committee, included
inconsistent data, no way to verify accuracy, and lack of flexibility in data
use.

Those problems resulted in high cost, the resulting lack of participation,
and a "limited payback" to participants, Thompson explained. He asserted that
the AMCRA project overcomes these problems by collecting raw claims and
enrollment data from individual plans and then manipulating them into a
common format for comparability, thereby minimizing the cost to participating
plans.

The kind of data to be included, according to Thompson, include average cost
per member and per month, and service- and procedure-specific utilization,
all analyzable demographically.

The data base won't analyze financial or administrative expenses and will
protect the confidentiality of individual patient information as well as the
identities of individual plans. There also is no attempt to adjust for plans
that do not furnish data to the data base.

AHD is meant for use not only by participating HMOs and PPOs, which would not
have to pay for it, but also by large employers, pharmaceutical companies,
actuaries, and government.

The concept, Thompson said, is to make it marketable to aid its self-
sufficiency after expected grant funding for its development runs out. He
added that AHD now has about half the funding needed for the developmental
phase, in which it plans to start establishing a paying customer base, and
expects to get the rest by the end of the year.

During the development phase, AHD will be able to offer both a standard
report and some custom reports, Fomby said. Starting in 1994, he said, the
data base also will allow dial-up access, with CD-ROM access planned for
"later." AHD will use encryption so that it can be accessed only with the
proper participant program.
