<h2 align=center> New Age techniques in the class room  </h2>
The following article was published in the Minneapolis Star and Tribune on Sunday December 30, 1984. This article is just another example of how many New Age methods and techniques, many which have their beginnings and roots in black magic, sorcery and various occult religions, are being accepted as a means of furthering the effectiveness of education.
<p> "Evidence is growing," Education Commissioner Ruth Randall has said, "The whole-mind instructional strategies involving relaxation, bio-feedback training, guided imagery, visualization and the conscious and unconscious control of mental processes have profound potential to improve educational outcomes." Randall cites "improved basic skills, reduced classroom disruption, enhanced student and teacher creativity, and a more rewarding experiences for students and teachers."
<p> Beverly-Colleene Galyean, a well known, leading educator promotes "Imaginary Guides", or "Spirit Guides" for children, even children in the first grade. Beverly-Colleen Gaylean's Blatant New Age curriculum has been used in classrooms and has been presented to many teachers in seminars. She has also received several grants to study the effects of imaginary work on intellectual development, academic achievement and emotional growth. The results of her research has been published in professional journals throughout the United States, and Canada and Europe. Gaylean Proclaims that "We need look only within ourselves to know the miracle we are."
<p> While the American educational system is attempting and succeeding at indoctrinating our young people in humanism, atheism, and relativism. Guess what is going on in the former Soviet Union. The same thing right? Wrong. In November of 1992, I had the privilege of speaking before the 8,000 plus delegation at the Association of Christian Schools International, annual convention in Anaheim, California. Four special guest at the convention included, Dr. Aleksandr G. Asmolov, Deputy, minister of Education of Russia, Dr. Aleksey K. Brudnov Chairman, Department of Alternative Education, Dr. Olga A. Polykovskaja, Education Specialist for Moral & Ethic Curriculum in Russia, and Dr. Alexandr M. Abramov Director, Moscow Institute for Development of Education Systems. These four individuals are among the highest ranking government officials in Russia's Education Department. Their purpose in coming to the United States was to meet with the leadership of the Association of Christian Schools International, so they might learn how to incorporate religion and morality into their schools. Yes, you read it correctly. The four government officials simply said, "Our country has tried the opposite, and it just did not work". In fact, christians from our country who have gone over to the former Soviet Union tell us that principals are begging for them to bring Bible into the schools. They just can not get enough copies to satisfy the demand. It is sad to say that here in the United States, we have much less religious freedom in education than our friends in Russia. The Bible is not even permitted in our school rooms.
