<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Competition is intensifying in the power generation and transmission business because of gradual deregulation.  With tougher competition, the heat rate of the power plant becomes a more important issue.  One long-established method to reduce the heat rate is to lower the back-pressure of the surface condenser.  This is accomplished by retubing existing units with commercially available enhanced tubes.  While this practice has been successfully used by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for the past 15 years, Argonne National Laboratory is now working with TVA and other utilities to (1) determine the potential heat-rate reductions that are possible by retubing with enhanced tubes; (2) make utilities aware of these benefits; and (3) eliminate such technical concerns as tube-side fouling, tube vibrations, and eddy currents.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
To determine the heat-rate reduction, Argonne has written a computer program that performs the lengthy thermal calculations on the basis of information supplied by the utility.  Publications in journals and presentations at conferences and meetings are being used by Argonne to acquaint utilities with the experience obtained with enhanced tubes and to address the most common concerns.

<P>
</CENTER>
The quantity of heat rejected by the tubes in surface condensers is a function of the surface area and the surface profile of the tubes.  Enhanced tubes improve the thermal performance inside the tube because they (1) increase the surface area per foot of tubing and (2) modify the flow field by increasing turbulence levels and decreasing the boundary-layer thickness.  Performance improvements outside the tube depend on the particular type of enhancement - that is, the disruption or roughness shapes and manufacturing process used.  These improvements are offset somewhat by an increase in tube-side pressure drop and higher fouling rates for some cooling-water types.
<P>
A computer program was developed to calculate the heat-rate reduction that can be obtained by retubing with Korodense LPD, a commercially available tube made by Wolverine Tube, Inc.  The program incorporates the thermal performance characteristics obtained by monitoring 14 operating TVA condensers that were retubed with Korodense LPD.
<P>
<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Argonne has conducted research to identify enhanced tubes that are superior in performance to Korodense LPD.  The research yielded two important findings:  (1) more outside enhancement is needed through the use of low-fins and (2) the internal disruption shapes should be more contoured.  Enhanced condenser tubes of the low-fin type are now being used successfully in Japan, but not in the United States.  The profile modifications of the spirally indented enhanced tubes can be made with a larger diameter indenting tool and are being considered as a possible option by Wolverine Tube.
<P>
The following major barriers to the use of enhanced condenser tubes have been eliminated:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Uncertainty of performance,
<LI>Concern of excessive fouling,
<LI>Lack of long-term successful demonstrations, and</LI>
<LI>Low cost-effectiveness. 
</UL>
<P>
Results of investigations to date indicate that increases of 30-40% in the overall heat-transfer coefficient (with a cleanliness factor equal to 
1.3 to 1.4) are obtained in the clean condition with Korodense LPD.  Argonne is continuing to monitor the performance of these units and that of others to update these characteristics.  For most river waters, the superior performance is maintained for a year or more.  The new clean condition can be obtained by mechanical or chemical cleaning during shutdown or by on-line ball cleaning.  Intermittent chlorination also effectively controls biofouling.  The 14 retubed TVA condensers are operating successfully, one of them for 15 years.  Recent studies with Argonne's computer program indicate that payback times of 1 to 3 years are possible for many utility condensers when retubing is necessary.
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Progress is being made to identify superior tube configurations for power-plant condensers.  Several have been identified, and approximate prediction methods were developed.  If funding is obtained, the next step will be to demonstrate these performance improvements by conducting experiments in the condenser of a host utility.
