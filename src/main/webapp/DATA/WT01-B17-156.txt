<tt>On the Edge with BURTON GOLDBERG</tt><p>

<font size="+1"><b>Why We Must Speak Out</font><br>
<i>When You Have a Voice, It's Imperative That You Use It</i></b><br>
<p>


A friend of mine recently told me that the Digest is too controversial. To be honest, I was gratified to hear this. To me, this is what being on the edge is about. It told me our mission is showing signs of success, our message is being heard, and we're stirring things up. <p>
"Too" means just the right amount of pressure is being applied to move something that doesn't want to move. When an issue becomes controversial, it means that somewhere the truth is being resisted; the more controversial things get, the more the resistance is mobilized to deny or block the truth.<p>
It's not that we relish being controversial for its own sake. Rather, it's that the urgency of our times demands that medical truths and the politics of medicine be spoken about in strong language. Too much is at stake for passivity or understated discourse. The future of American health care and the health of Americans are at stake. <p>
How can you keep quiet when you read the clinical research and see that oncologists ignore it, when you see how conventional medicine is harming people, and when you see how alternative medicine reverses illness quickly, affordably, and without damaging the patient?<p>
Unless alternative medicine is recognized at the federal level as a viable, legal, and supported medical option, conventional medicine and its toxic treatments mandated by the government as the only legitimate treatment will bankrupt us, and it may kill us as well.<p>
The more I study the field of American health care and its skewed politics, the more outraged I feel. Consider these recent examples. <p>
In February 1996, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally designated tamoxifen a carcinogen. A synthetic hormone, tamoxifen is the drug most widely prescribed to prevent breast cancer recurrence. Studies now show that a significant number of women taking tamoxifen after surviving breast cancer develop endometrial cancer. In response to WHO's anouncement, the National Cancer Institute and Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, which makes the drug, aggressively lobbied State of California regulators to keep them from adding tamoxifen to their list of carcinogens. <p>
This is not from some underground news source, but the mainstream journal, Science News, March 2, 1996. Here is open evidence of a government agency, chartered to find a cure for cancer, flagrantly colluding with a drug company to keep a known carcinogen on the market and keep the public from learning of its dangers. In this instance, NCI worked to promote cancer by suppressing information about a known carcinogen. This should have been a controversy of high order; instead, it was barely reported in the press and few heard about it.
Here is a second example. On September 28, 1996, patients and supporters of the beleaguered Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D., inventor of the successful antineoplaston therapy for cancer, will march in Washington, D.C. They will be protesting the FDA's unjustified and continuing persecution and prosecution of Dr. Burzynski and its attempts to use the courts to put him in jail and send his antineoplastons to the rubbish heap of outlawed cancer therapies. <p>
In October, Dr. Burzynski goes to court to defend himself against the FDA's criminal charge that he treated cancer patients who crossed state lines to get his antineoplastons. That's the best FDA could concoct against him in their efforts to quash antineoplastons, which are antitumor substances originally identified in human urine. 
The fact that Dr. Burzynski runs an FDA-approved drug manufacturing plant and that he has cooperated with the National Institutes of Health in studies on the effectiveness of antineoplastons against cancer, and that many of his patients publicly avow they owe their life to him seems to have little bearing on FDA's witch-hunt. <p>
"If the FDA wins," says Rita Starr, spokesperson for the Burzynski Patients Organization, "it will reinforce FDA's legal right to make the most personal and important decision of our lives: the right to heal ourselves as we choose. Leave it to the FDA to criminalize the saving of human life." <p>
The FDA's role in our health care system and their power to criminalize successful alternative physicians ought to be a great deal more controversial than it is. The case of Dr. Burzynski, not the first innovative physician to be harassed by the U.S. government, may be the wedge that cracks open the monopolistic edifice of conventional medicine and puts a muzzle on its rabid watchdog, public health enemy No. 1, the FDA.
Elsewhere in the country, in July of this year, the Medical Board of New Jersey suspended the license of Eric R. Braverman, M.D., director of Princeton Associates for Total Health and a leading proponent of alternative medicine in that state. According to Dr. Braverman (author of several important books including PATH Wellness Manual and, with Carl C. Pfeiffer, M.D., Ph.D., the giant of orthomolecular nutrition, The Healing Nutrients Within), the Medical Board has been trying to nail him for 18 months, in large part because the Board didn't approve of his alternative approach to medical care. <p>
Dr. Braverman was saving patients a lot of money by presenting low-cost alternatives to expensive heart bypass and hysterectomy surgeries. Any time a doctor jeopardizes the $1 trillion honey pot of conventional medicine with an inexpensive and almost always more effective alternative, the financial watchdogs mobilize the medical licensing boards to start tearing up the doctor's reputation.<p>
The best the New Jersey Board could scrape up in 18 months of investigations at taxpayers' expense were 3 patient complaints, which were actually about billing, not therapy. "On a legal basis, they showed no evidence of harm by me whatsoever to any patients and no errors of significance," says Dr. Braverman. "I am defending my right as a doctor to use psychopharmacological agents for the treatment of my patients."<p>
Dr. Braverman's case, and the dozens of others involving reputable, competent physicians that preceded it, ought to be a matter of serious and raging controversy. <p>
Before you can raise your voice and add volume to the controversy, you need to understand the issues at stake. Alerting our readers to these issues is what the Digest is all about, and if we attract controversy in the process, so much the better. That's why we call the Digest the voice of alternative medicine—because we're willing to use it to speak out on behalf of your health and freedom. <p>
