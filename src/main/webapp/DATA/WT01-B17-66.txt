<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Detoxification: Part Two</CENTER></H2>
        
In Part One of the detoxification plan, Dr. Corsello spoke about the
important issue of scrubbing your bowels with fiber, plus the necessity of
adding the antioxidant, vitamin C. This helps to impede the reabsorption of
toxic substances into the liver and ultimately into the bloodstream. The toxins,
unfortunately, come from the food and water we inadvertently ingest. Bowel
cleansing is a very essential first step. (For details ofthis first step in
detoxification, see Alternative Medicine Digest, issue 4.) 
<P>Serafina Corsello,
MD, Director of the Corsello Centers in New York City and Huntington, NY,
continues her advice on detoxification.

<P>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>The liver is the central seat of detoxification.</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>

"Let's now discuss what happens, primarily in our liver, when the toxic
substances find their way back into this very important organ, the central seat
of detoxification. For the record, food and water are not the only sources of
toxic substances entering our system. Our respiratory tract and our skin are two
very important ports of entry as well. "

<P>In the previous issue, we told you the
story of the couple who got lead poisoning from the organic food raised in their
backyard because of its close proximity to the highway. Let me tell you now
about Marilyn, a young, intelligent housewife who was poisoned by her own new
house. 

<P>"Most insulation, presswood, and building materials contain formaldehyde,
a formidable toxic substance that accumulates in our fatty tissues and finds its
way into the liver. For years, Marilyn's liver had to contend with unhealthful
eating habits. Now the toxic invisible fumes were more than her body could
handle. 

<P>"By the time she came to me, Marilyn was a universal reactor. This means
she could have a host of unpredictable reactions ranging from crying spells to
anger to migraines at the slightest provocation. Even a smell, including my
perfume, could set her off. Universal reactors are very unfortunate people who
have exhausted most of their liver detoxification resources. They are dead ducks
in a very dangerous pond.

<P>
        "Marilyn changed living quarters, but to no avail. Even with all the
knowledge she had acquired, unless she rebuilt lost cellular reserves in her
body, the slightest insult would assume the impact of an atomic war. 

<P>"We started
with bowel cleansing, added the lactobacillus to build the friendly flora, and
began to build her liver glutathione reserves. Glutathione is a very important
detoxifying nutrient.


<P>

<CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE>Universal reactors are dead ducks in a very dangerous pond</BLOCKQUOTE></CENTER>
<HR WIDTH=90%>

<P>"Let's step back for a moment and see what has happened to the liver through
all these wars, which include petrochemical exposure, toxic metal exposure, fast
foods that deplete enzymatic reserves, and the foods that fail to replenish
them. Under desirable circumstances, the liver quickly tries to dispose oftoxic
substances through Phase One and Phase Two detoxification processes. Phase One
requires enzymes that are zinc-dependent. Government-run epidemiological studies
have shown that the American diet is grossly defective in zinc intake.

<P>"If this
first step is not brought to its proper end, the attempted detoxification leads
to the formation of even more deadly toxic substances. One of these is chloral
hydrate, which causes a toxic brain syndrome and further impairs liver
functions. 

<P>"Let us assume that we are lucky enough to have the zinc enzymes in
place and move further down on Phase One detoxification. This time we need
molybdenum-rich enzymes, another casualty of modern agricultural practices.
<A NAME="magnes"> </A>
<P>"Through all this, we need lots of magnesium, which is a cofactor in 300 or more
cellular biochemical reactions, including liver detoxification. Most American
diets are very poor in magnesium, the major sources of which are vegetables and
almonds. 
<A NAME="selen"> </A>
<P>"If our luck continues and we are still left with the need to get rid
of toxic substances, here comes Phase Two, called Conjugation Phase-a more
sophisticated process that requires enzymes such as glutathione. Glutathione is
composed of three amino acids: cysteine, glutamic acid, and glycine. When
combined with selenium, this very important enzyme gives birth to glutathione
peroxidase, which protects us from our own internal toxins that burn holes into
our fatty tissue-including tissue in liver and brain.

<HR WIDTH=90%><A NAME="Stress"> </A>
<CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE>"Sress produces more free readicals and also depletes zinc, vitamin b6, magnesium, and 
other important nutrients."</BLOCKQUOTE></CENTER>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>
        "Most American diets are defective in selenium. Is it any wonder that there
are so many more universal reactors today than I ever saw when I first came to
this country 32 years ago? As you have already surmised, the reasons are
multiple. The environment has become more polluted by the day. Our lack of
rotation crops fails to replenish the soil. Pesticides not only add to the toxic
load but also displace the nutrients that would serve to protect us. "Stress
also plays a role by producing more free radicals and depleting zinc, vitamin
B6, magnesium, and other important nutrients. Stress not only depletes nutrients
but also makes more demands for the antioxidants dependent on the nutrients that
have been excreted. Anyone working in this field for as long as I have knows
very well that well-nourished cells help us to have a higher tolerance for
stress.

<CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE>"Harmful formaldehyde enters our environment every time we bring clothes home 
from the cleaners. remove bags and allow clothes to air before placing in the closet."</BLOCKQUOTE></CENTER>
<HR width=90%>

<P>     "In Marilyn's case, the question ofwhich came first, the chicken or the egg
(the stress or the nutrient deficiencies), would have been a purely academic
question. Marilyn was in such bad shape that she needed rebuilding, which became
a painstaking two-year process of infusions of glutathione and other
antioxidants, lots of love and understanding, change in diet, and a prayer here
and there. So please do not get to this point-it is not fun. Remember the good,
sound American saying: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. More
than for any other condition, this saying must be kept in mind for the universal
reactor, especially since there are cases that are so far gone that the patient
has not been able to be brought back to a normal, healthy life. 
<P>
<HR width=90%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Your antioxidant mix should contain glutathione, n-acetyl cysteine, and taurine.</CENTER></H3>

<HR width=90%>
<P>"In Part One of
our discussion, we recommended bowel cleansing as the first step of any
detoxification program, plus vitamin C and minerals. The ascorbate recommended
also contains selenium, zinc, magnesium, manganese, and more. Now we suggest
that you add the next step in the program. This includes eating lots of
vegetables, rich in antioxidants. If you can, please buy organic produce-it's
safer. Also, be aware of fumes, not only radon, but the ever-present
formaldehyde that enters our environment every time we bring clothes home from
the cleaners. Remove bags and allow to air before placing in the closet. This is
just one little thing you can do, but a significant one if you use the dry
cleaner as much as I do. 
<A NAME="multi"> </A>
<P>"I advise taking a good multi-vitamin-mineral
combination, high in magnesium, plus an antioxidant mix that contains
glutathione, n-acetyl cysteine, taurine, and more! Of course, those of you
already taking a panoply of nutrients know that vitamin C and the minerals
mentioned are the standby in any supplement program. These are the bare minimum
nutrients with which to start a detoxification program. 

<P>"Definitely use air and
water filters. Next time, we'll talk about why water filters have become a
necessity for all of us."'
