This is it, your last day in the saddle. What a week it's been! After today, NO MORE HILLS! After today, a lot of good memories. Make the most of the smiles and warm welcomes guaranteed to greet you, introduce yourself to that cyclist you've been wanting to meet all week.
<P>
Spray, our lunch host, is a small community, population 150. As you pedal into town, make a stop at the church built at the turn-of-the-century that has been restored and is now a museum. While you're eating, enjoy the spirited western sounds of the Wheeler County Trio.
<P>
In Fossil, be prepared for a hero's welcome, as the town's school children greet you with genuine joy. This community, named after the discovery of some fossilized bones of an elephant, has never been known to do anything in a small way. You'll receive a special fossil-like gift, be part of a wonderful surprise and realize, if you haven't already, that you have much to proud of in completing Cycle Oregon VIII.
