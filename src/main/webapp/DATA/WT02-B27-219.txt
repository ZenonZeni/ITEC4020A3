<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Peta Sandars</FONT></P>

<P>An established writer is always a great asset to a campaigning organisation,
and one with a committed interest doubly so. Peta Sandars had worked in
accounts and teaching before her talents as a writer kept her busy in magazine
and stage work - then her first novel was very successful. Her second novel,
Gone Tomorrow, is a historical saga features a very independent woman dying
of pancreatic cancer: she asks people to help her commit suicide but eventually
has to resort to assistance from an unscrupulous character. She says, &quot;I
write what makes me angry.&quot; Moral dilemmas feature strongly in her
work - a fellow novelist even said she &quot;hijacks the genre&quot;!</P>

<P>But it is Peta's own health that has brought the issues of v.e. into
sharper focus. She suffers from a mild form of MS - fortunately it is not
debilitating, but it is sufficiently scary to make her intimately aware
of the situations that can drive people to self-deliverance. &quot;For
someone like myself, the fact that Departing Drugs exists is a major advantage.&quot;</P>

<P>In spite of working long hours (she travels the country doing research
for her writing), Peta Sandars always seems to have been involved in humanitarian
causes: Campaign Against the Arms Trade, Amnesty, the Green Party, Friends
of the Earth and, more recently, VESS. She was soon reported around the
world for her pithy comments on v.e. (&quot;The slippery slopes argument
could be used to prohibit the manufacture of Doc Marten's boots because
some psychopaths might conceivably use them to kick people's heads in.&quot;)
Soon, she was one of the most active of our public speakers, learning the
techniques necessary to convince on television and radio.</P>

<P>But, like Beloff, she has involved herself in the day-to-day work at
grass-roots level. Using her early experience in accounts, Peta Sandars
as Treasurer has modernised the VESS book-keeping methods and now spends
many hours in the Office preparing reports and helping in other, mundane
ways. Immersing herself in the work at the coal-face helps her to counter
opposition effectively. On television she demonstrates adroitness both
with technical data and quickly switches where necessary to more emotive
use of words. &quot;People abandon reason for emotion - you have to meet
them on their own terms.&quot;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Peta Sandars - writings on v.e. can be found in VESS Newsletter

Journal 1995 2(1), pp14-16. A biographical article has also appeared in
Mensa Magazine. Gone Tomorrow is published by Bantam, May 1997 under her
pen name, Jane Gurney.</FONT></P>
