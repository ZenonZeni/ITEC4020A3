From initial site assessments and environmental strategic planning to final remedial action,
MK’s Environmental/Government Group offers a complete range of services to both government
and private-sector clients.<p>
Ranked third in Engineering News Record’s 1996 listing of the nation’s top hazardous-waste
contractors, MK, through the Environmental/Government Group, serves five primary markets:
on-site industrial waste treatment and pollution control; municipal waste management;
high- and low-level radioactive waste disposal; dedicated facilities for waste treatment and
disposal; and environmental restoration. The group provides clients with full-service
capabilities for hazardous, toxic and radioactive waste (HTRW) management.
These capabilities include waste-management strategies; system and facility design and
construction; contaminated site remediation; and facility decontamination and
decommissioning.<p>
Three federal agencies, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense and the
Environmental Protection Agency are the group’s primary public-sector clients and this
work includes some of the largest environmental undertakings in history.
The group serves as the remedial action contractor for the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial
Action (UMTRA) Project, a 700-site restoration effort in 10 states. In Missouri,
an MK team serves as project management contractor at the Weldon Spring Superfund Site,
a remediation project with an estimated cost of $900 million. MK is a major subcontractor,
providing environmental restoration and waste-management services for the multibillion-dollar
cleanup of the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology site near Denver.
These long-term environmental restoration programs at Rocky Flats, Weldon Spring,
and five plant sites under DOE’s Oak Ridge Operations will provide revenue to MK through
the year 2000 and beyond.<p>
For the Defense Nuclear Agency, work is underway internationally for the second of two projects
to neutralize intercontinental ballistic missiles in the former Soviet states under the Cooperative
Threat Reduction Program.<p>
An Environmental Response Action Contract (ERAC) awarded by the Navy involves remediation
work at installations in a 22-state area of the central U.S. and has a ceiling of $300 million.
Under two $50-million contracts with the Army Corps of Engineers, MK is also performing
remedial actions at military installations in Hawaii, Southern California, Southern Nevada,
and Arizona as well as demolition/remediation at the Bunker Hill Superfund Site in
northern Idaho.<p>
For private clients, the group has undertaken cleanup projects at a variety of sites,
including manufacturing plants, abandoned oil refineries or refinery waste dumps, mine sites
and solid-waste landfills.<p>
A team of Emkayans, under contract to Shell and its counsel, has been involved in the
remediation of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Colorado for the past decade --
an effort that recently resulted in the signing of the Record of Decision that spells out the
final cleanup of this site located adjacent to Denver. Ultimately destined to serve as a
Wildlife Refuge, the site has already undergone large-scale interim remedial actions,
including the treatment and recycling of approximately 11 million gallons of liquid waste
from past weapons production and chemical manufacturing,
which earned an MK-led team a certificate for Outstanding Performance.<p>
In Oklahoma, MK provided remedial design and technical and support services during
remediation of the Sand Springs Petrochemical Complex Superfund site that recently was
brought to a successful completion ahead of schedule. Almost 100,000 cubic yards of acid
and oily sludge was excavated and treated on site. The treated material was then buried in its
original location in a secure landfill. In Arkansas, the group operated the first commercial
incineration facility certified for dioxin waste in North America. <p>
Currently, the group is providing construction services during cleanup of an aluminum plant for
Alcoa in New York, engineering a major tailings modernization project for Kennecott Utah
Copper near Salt Lake City, and managing construction of a new gold mine for an AMAX
subsidiary near Fairbanks, Alaska. In Texas, MK’s CF Systems is implementing a $24-million
full-scale remediation and waste treatment operation at the United Creosoting Superfund Site.
Selected as the site’s technology of choice by EPA Region VI and the Texas Water Commission,
CF Systems provides proprietary solvent extraction technology for the treatment and
recycling of petroleum wastes and for remediation of contaminated soils and wastewater.<p>
The Company’s environmental services are supported by professionals in technical disciplines
such as environmental engineering and related environmental sciences, engineering geology,
surface and groundwater hydrology, atmospheric science, chemistry, geochemistry, civil and
mechanical engineering, process engineering, chemical engineering, construction and
construction management. <p>
