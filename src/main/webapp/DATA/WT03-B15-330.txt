MK SIGNS CONTRACT FOR HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FOR REMOTE REGION OF NEPAL</b></center>
<P>
BOISE -- 

    Morrison Knudsen announced today that its Engineering &amp; Construction 
Group has signed a contract for design and construction supervision 
services on the $400 million Kali Gandaki &quot;A&quot; Hydroelectric Project with 
His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMGN) through the Nepal Electricity 
Authority (NEA).  MK will be responsible for construction engineering, 
preparation of construction drawings and construction supervision for the 
duration of the five-year project, including assistance with the 
subsequent 12-month start-up, testing and operation period.

<p>
     The project is comprised of a dam and desanding facilities; a 6km, 
7.4m diameter headrace tunnel; and a 144MW power plant, including 105km of 
132kv transmission lines and substations.  E&amp;C's MK Centennial Division, 
as the principal member of Kali Gandaki &quot;A&quot; Associates (KGAA), has been 
the project's engineer of record since 1992.  MK Centennial provided
hydroelectric engineering and design services and developed seven 
tender-document packages for civil works and equipment-supply contracts 
for the total project.  The project, which will utilize the hydropower 
potential of the Kali Gandaki River, is located in a remote area 
approximately 90 kilometers north of Butwal, Nepal, and 180 kilometers 
west of Kathmandu.

<p>
     Robert A. Tinstman, MK's president and chief executive officer said, 
&quot;Kali Gandaki is an exciting opportunity to utilize MK's heritage of 'Can 
Do' frontier spirit and extensive hydropower know-how to tackle formidable 
terrain and improve life in far-off locations.&quot;  This  hydroelectric
facility will be able to operate year-round from the river's power, 
protecting populated areas in and around Kathmandu from brownouts and 
blackouts.

<p>
     MK has been developing water-resource projects and designing and 
constructing hydroelectric facilities for over half a century in more than 
50 countries around the world.


<p>
Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE--MK), founded in 1912, serves the
world's environmental, industrial, mining, operations & maintenance,
power, process, transportation and heavy construction markets as an
engineer and constructor.<p>
