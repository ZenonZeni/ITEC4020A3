<P>
Our systematic investment process relies on these proprietary
models. The first three models identify undervalued stocks, while
the Risk Model helps build optimal portfolios. These models operate
in real time so that our portfolios always reflect the most current
information available.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Appraisal Model</FONT>
<P>
<I>The Appraisal Model is the heart of our approach. This model
carefully analyzes the detailed fundamental data for all companies
in the market and determines the &quot;fair value&quot; for each
company. The model makes subtle and detailed measurement of the
value of every company's business, based upon a comprehensive
assessment of earnings, assets and sales in the industries in
which the company operates. The model appraises detailed line
items of the balance sheet and income statement, as well as off-balance
sheet items. The Appraisal Model identifies companies that are
currently priced below their fair value as stocks to buy.</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Earnings Change Model</FONT>
<P>
<I>The Earnings Change Model forecasts future earnings for companies.
It enables Barr Rosenberg Mutual Funds to invest in companies
that are expected to have superior future earnings growth, and
to sell companies that are expected to have declining earnings
in the future.</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Investor Sentiment Model</FONT>
<P>
<I>The Investor Sentiment Model forecasts short-term price trends.
It assists us in buying stocks before they have a rise in performance,
and in selling stocks before their prices fall. The model studies
detailed data on investor attitudes, including analysts' earnings
estimates, brokers' recommendations and dealers' positions as well as 
stock market returns and trading volume, to infer momentum and enthusiasm 
for individual stocks.</I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4>Risk Model</FONT>
<P>
<I>The Risk Model uses the information developed by the stock
selection models to maximize return while minimizing active risk.
It predicts the contribution of each stock to the risk and reward
of the aggregate portfolio. The size of any one position is determined
by the optimizer as it constructs the most efficient portfolio.</I>
