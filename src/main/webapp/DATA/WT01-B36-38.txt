<blockquote>
    <p>'Turn on to acid, man,<br>
    Get into the channels of your mind<br>
    Go see what there is to find&#151;<br>
    No one knows the human mind... </p>

    <p>There are doors as yet unopened <br>
    So much to see, <br>
    Drop some acid, man, <br>
    Go see what you can find. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I never saw life as I know it, man, <br>
    It was all in my mind. <br>
    Things have become much clearer<br>
    Now that I've opened up my mind. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Before all this, life was such a drag; <br>
    Working on Chrysler's pressure line <br>
    Just to pay for a shag. <br>
    Working on the track <br>
    Just to score some bread <br>
    So I and the wife and kids <br>
    Could be fed and comfy <br>
    In our suburban shack. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>But all that's gone now <br>
    Since I've seen life for the first time <br>
    Through the channels of my mind. <br>
    Acid was the key, it turned me on <br>
    And helped me to find <br>
    The right channels in my mind.' </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Returning to America after an absence of nearly
four years was much more than a sentimental journey, much more
than just filling in time; I was a man trying to maintain his
soul alive. Keep the candle flame ablaze.... When all was growing
dark. It was the wriggling to avoid death, essentially a poetic
thing, undertaken without either rationality or reason. I wanted
to probe something solid to live by. And travel was an available
means to see, look, find &#151; <i>'la vraie vie'.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My internal space had changed since Millbrook and
our first brief experiment in 'transpersonative living', when
acid was the lance with which to ride after the Grail. There was
now (1968) little good acid around, and what there was&#151;the
so-called 'street acid'&#151;came mainly from California. There
was something wrong with the synthesis; it was not pure. And you
were never sure what it was exactly that you were taking, so I
only dropped it on those rare occasions when someone gave me
either 'Sandoz acid' or 'crystal acid'. I think the problem for
the underground chemists manufacturing clandestine acid was
shortage of ergot, without which the synthesis of d-LSD-25 is
impossible. Until 1965, supplies of ergot could be bought with
little or no difficulty from three or four European chemical
companies; but pressure from Washington put a stop to this,
doubtlessly hopeful that this would lead to an end of clandestine
LSD. In one sense the Federal authorities were right. The
underground ceased turning out d-LSD-25; instead, they discovered
a wholly synthetic substance, akin to d-LSD-25 in so far as it
produced marked change in consciousness. But the new synthetic
acid lacked, in my opinion, that invisible non-pharmacological
factor&#151;the magical, spiritual component that was really what
acid was all about. Sure, the new stuff 'worked' in the sense
that any mind-altering chemical 'works' to produce subjective
effects within the body, but it didn't seem to produce in those
who used it any particularly noticeable elevation of either head
or heart; at least, that was the conclusion I had reached in
London. But it was&#151;and probably still is&#151;an unpopular
view amongst the 'cognoscenti', who claim that some of the street
acid is capable of producing positive subjective effects of a
'long-lasting nature', though they readily admit that a lot of
the stuff sold as 'pure acid' is actually methylamphetamine (a
concentrated form of amphetamine, first developed by the U.S.
Army) or a stripped-down ergotamine compound by modern molecular
chemistry. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My evaluation had nothing to do with the notion
that a wholly synthetic drug produced a wholly synthetic
experience&#151;the intellectual response&#151;but was based on
direct, first hand experience (about thirty trips with street
acid in all). And in each session I felt there was something it
lacked&#151;it was too 'electric', too 'speedy' and too
'mind-shattering'. The earlier clarity of 'insight' which I had
obtained via the Sandoz acid was replaced by confusion,
brokenness, words and worlds thrown into absolute dismemberment
or even, absolute chaos, though, I must add, often coupled with a
feeling that I can only describe as 'sublime inflation', a
superabundance of emotive energy; but it could not signify; more
a passionate flame and less the life-giving sun, as it were. I
have read that d-LSD-25 is a semi-synthetic substance, of which
ergot is the organic, i.e. 'living' part. And to say that the
'spiritual' component is contained within the ergot molecules
must sound like a superstition to some, but what I intend here is
to suggest that 'pure' acid has 'metapolitical'
implications&#151;there is a hidden truth or statement in each
acid session which is unaccountably missing in most of my
experiences using the clandestine stuff, Owsley and
'white-lightning' notwithstanding. There is, it seems to me, a
qualitative decline in the subjective acid experience which is
something that does not admit of scientific analysis; it is an
intuitive thing I'd say. At any rate, I personally observed a
voluntary moratorium during this period and would take nothing
until I knew the exact chemical synthesis and where it was made
and by whom. Besides, there was little or no shortage of good
marijuana or hashish, our so-called 'mild psychedelics'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A psychedelic is the solvent which dissolves the
vigorous stereotypes of egocentric behaviour&#151;it transforms
the familiar self without changing a thing; it expands the
moment: yet there isn't anything we can count on or accumulate;
its value is poetic&#151;it helps ferry us across the abyss and
we may thus gain a new amplitude; it is not a 'psychological'
experience but a poetic one. It is best of course to undergo such
metamorphosis by means of tuning in to nature, though it is only
the very rarest of Westerners who can do this; we seem unable to
develop our own power of concentration sufficiently to live
consciously and continuously in our deepest self. We cannot
become more than we are. It may be that we cannot even become
what we are&#151;'there is only becoming' e.e. cummings says; for
us, then, Being is becoming; yet it remains possibility only,
never achievement. It is all a matter of recognition; we must
become capable of visualising ideas in order to live at the very
heart of our being. It is all so simple that any child could do
it (if only we don't try to explain). Or: only a child can do it.
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Cambridge, Mass., is the home of both Harvard
College and M.I.T. and stands across from the city of Boston,
separated by the River Charles, about thirty minutes by taxi from
Logan airport. It was snowing when I reached Gunther's house in
Mount Auburn Street; the town was as if deserted by man. The
gigantic apartment block on the opposite side of the street
towered up from a snowy wasteland, surrounded by a few straggling
trees. Every now and again one saw the lights of a car slowly
moving along the driveway flanking the river; visibility was soon
almost reduced to nil. The lady taxi-driver swore as I paid the
fare, wishing she'd stayed in Boston. Then she propositioned me.
'We could get to know each other in the parking lot,' she added,
waving to the back seat. 'There's not much else to do on a night
like this.' I said I was bushed after the long flight from London
but this only seemed to add spice to her game. 'I've only made it
with one English guy before, and he was the best ball I've ever
had, though a fucking bastard otherwise,' she added. Why not? She
was pretty, in her late twenties. 'Okay. Let's get to the parking
lot,' I said. 'Crazy! But in case you're kinky or something, you
know, want to cut off my tits or anything, Jack-the-Ripper style,
I'll blow your brains out with this.' And reaching inside the
glove compartment she suddenly produced an enormous revolver.
'Protection, you understand. If you want to live in Boston, baby,
you've gotta have a piece. Bam! Get it?' 'Are those things legal
here?' I asked, seemingly dumb. 'Legal, regal; the fuzz ain't
gonna bust ya for a piece, though they get pretty rough if you
kill someone. No, it's protection.' 'But what if everyone carried
a gun, then what...?' 'Then you'd be stupid not to, right?
Anyway, I was only kidding. It ain't got no bullets in the
chamber, maybe just two or three. I use it to scare drunks who
get fresh.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was in the right mood when, a couple of hours and
several drinks later, I rang Gunther's doorbell. I had called
Gunther from the airport but the baby-sitter said he was at the
Gurdjieff centre and wouldn't be back much before
midnight&#151;(a well-observed ritual vouches for the truly human
and therefore natural sequence of human behaviours; if the
meeting which a person needs is missed, then the psyche feels
cheated, and a sense of loss and remorse or worse is bound to
follow. Gunther believed in the ritual attendance of the
Gurdjieff meetings; he didn't necessarily believe in Gurdjieff
rituals, which, so far as one can understand them at all, seem to
depend on the presence of the Master himself, but the weekly
thing was important for the harmonious function of his
creativity.) <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But Gunther was back, and we greeted each other
warmly with hugs and smiles and 'Wow-it's-great-to-see-you'
stuff. Yes, it really did feel good to be back; (almost) as
though I'd never been away. We spent the first few hours rapping,
filling in the blanks, trying to find out what had happened to us
both across the random and haphazard years since Harvard and
Millbrook. For myself change, unceasing change, as though change
was the only constant in my life. And Gunther? He was now
teaching at Boston College. 'A bit ironic, really, a Jew teaching
at a <i>Jesuit</i> establishment', working as a consultant with a
New York media company, 'They sent me to India recently to tape
some Indian music for a record', and running the Boston Gurdjieff
Centre. 'Man, that cat knew more about human psychology than
anyone I've come across before. I really dig his work.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I then discovered that quite a number of the old
Harvard psychedelic class of 1961-62 now worked for the Harvard
Corporation&#151;George Litwin was a professor at the Harvard
Business School, Al Alschuler lectured at the Harvard School of
Education, Dave Kolb was an instructor at M.I.T. and Huston Smith
was still professor of religious philosophy (M.I.T.), Dave Katz
was teaching at Boston's Brandeis University, Walter Clark was a
professor of the psychology of religion at Tufts University and
had helped start the Cambridge Neurobiological and Psychedelic
Study Group (together with Clemens E. Benda M.D., and the late
Max Rinkel M.D.). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously, the medicine of hallucination and the
wonders of indiscipline had lost their appeal&#151;everybody
wanted to forget the 'Harvard Drug Scandal'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'It all seems so ordinary now.' Gunther was almost
apologetic when he spoke about former times. 'People turn on
differently nowadays, you know, <i>sans drugs,</i> <i>sans trips.</i>
Not Young-Man-Left-to Old-Man-Right but evolution of sensibility.
Today people dig astrology, Meher Baba, the Tarot, the I Ching,
Gurdjieff, macrobiotic food, yogas, even plain work.... ' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sure enough, when I did the telephone rounds the
next morning, everyone was into their own 'non-drug' thing. It
was as if Tim Leary and the Harvard Psychedelic Project had never
existed&#151;Al Cohen hadn't taken acid for over four years and
now busied himself as head of the American Meher Baba Group. 'I
dropped acid for three years, and it took me three years to
transcend acid. Now I don't even think about it. Of Acid, the
Avatar had this to say: &quot;It doesn't bring you closer to God,
for I am God and I tell you it takes you further away from
Me&quot;.' Rolf von Eckartsberg, who used to co-edit <i>The
Psychedelic Review</i> was a psychology professor at the
University of Pennsylvania and was running a 'global village'
project in Pittsburg; Paul Lee, also a former co-editor of <i>The
Psychedelic Review</i> was teaching humanities and religion at
the University of California in Santa Cruz; Stanley Krippner was
the director of The Dream Laboratory at the Maimonides Hospital
in Brooklyn; Frank Barron was a professor at Berkeley and the
author of 'Creativity and Psychological Health'; Joe Havens was
also still lecturing and writing papers on the theme 'Religion
Ponders Science'; and Richard Alpert was in India with his Hindu
Guru, Neem Karolli Baba, or simply 'Maharaj-ji' as he is usually
called, who told him, <i>à propos</i> LSD, 'In a quiet place
where it is cool and you are feeling much peace, taken alone, it
can bring you into the presence of Christ to do <i>pranams.</i>
But you can only stay a few hours and then must leave. Better by
far to become Christ. For that, Love is the best medicine, better
than LSD. LSD is not the true <i>Samadhi.</i> These medicines
were known about in the Kulu Valley, but now that knowledge is
lost.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It felt almost obscene to mention this three-letter
word under the circumstances and I began to wonder whether I had
got things cocked or somehow not quite right. I was frequently
asked the same question: 'Do you still take acid?' which always
contained a definite, if unspoken clause&#151;after what happened
in Manhattan's Lower East Side and the Haight-Ashbury district of
San Francisco, after reports of people jumping out of windows or
staring at the sun until they were blind, can the psychedelic
experience still claim to a place in the New Age? Did Leary do
for LSD as the liberal-humanist did for stereotaxic surgery
(leucotomy), (which is the selective destruction of brain
tissue&#151;'Law'n Order surgery') and its claim as a therapeutic
adjunct to mental anguish? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Not a few thinkers have thought so. During the
years following the Leary-Alpert firings many attacks against
non-prescriptive drug usage have appeared in the mass media. The
corruption of the original mystical insights reported in the
early (1960-63) literature has led to the corruption of popular
opinion, who now view the psychedelic experience as a subject too
complex, too weird to be discussed in a rational way. The mystic
with the gift of the third eye expected to proclaim the reign of
the happily integrated modern soul but instead he had found
himself considered something of an oddball, and a resented one at
that. Now he sits in solitary exile or behind the bars of the
lunatic asylum whilst the village idiot walks Times Square with a
gun in each hand. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Do you still take acid? Does Leary still
proselytise for LSD, trip out for days?' our visitor asks, as one
may also be supposed to know about heroin, cocaine, speed,
glue-sniffing and nitrous oxide. 'Mass-mysticism is poetry, an
open secret&#151;the message is in the seed.' As ancient Zen
might have had it&#151;'Take LSD for ten years, become LSD, and
then forget about it'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The power of Zen&#151;there is nothing to hold on
to; the power of the aphorism. In his Frederick William Atherton
lecture (Harvard University, 1967), Norman O. Brown reminds us
that </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Aphorism is instant dialectic<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; the instantaneous flip instead of the elaborate
    system...<br>
    And so perishable<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; that it cannot be hoarded by any elite <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or stored in any institution.'<br>
    'Aphorism: the word smells of literary self-consciousness the<br>
    reality is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; brokenness<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; words in absolute dismemberment <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; or even, absolute self-contradiction.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Like the historical Oxford Movement the Psychedelic
Movement is a Western response to the pathogenic signs of our
inner disruption, and is recognised as such by the New Radicals
and by a tiny circle of metaphysicians in both the West and the
East, just as the revolutionary anarchist movement was a century
ago. For LSD is anarchistic, it shatters our complacency,
explodes our stereotypes of ideology and dogmas, wakes, shakes,
and makes the inner sleeping man from the somnambulist gravity of
rectitude or righteousness. It is the madness that revels in the
categories of being in which not one member is sober. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Madness need not necessarily be a cause for
gloom&#151;our greatest blessing, says Socrates in the <i>Phaedrus</i>,
come to us by way of madness&#151;provided; and the madness comes
from God, he adds, someone like the God Dionysus or the spirit
Mercurius or Siva, a condition which cannot be programmed,
something whose truth lies beyond all power of words. Yet smile
at our sad impasse. We cannot simply let ourselves go. 'I am
fully aware of this,' Ionesco says, 'teach me how to untie the
knots. I know I ought to undo them on my own and that this is a
task everyone must carry out for himself, but at least give me a
little guidance, so that I can see how the bonds I cannot loosen
are tied.' But no help is forthcoming. The only reality is the
truth of our own contradictory nature; truth is simply a more
efficient form of fiction, Maya like everything else. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Can anyone teach Ionesco to untie the knots? 'The
principal instrument of monopoly and control that prevents
expansion of consciousness is the word lines controlling thought,
feeling and apparent sensory impressions of the human host,' says
Burroughs, but he makes a common error for he fails to
distinguish the word from the experience. Another answer:
according to Joey Mellen and Bart Huges, is that it is man's
rigid cranium that prevents him from expanding his consciousness,
not his words... </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'When the skull seals the tide of brainbloodvolume is <br>
    out on the beach the adult dangles from the gallows&#151;<br>
    around his neck a chain of word associations&#151;<br>
    suspended on his own sentence<br>
    the adult passes judgement on his children&#151;<br>
    his children&#151;if they've any sense&#151;pay no attention <br>
    but bounce about<br>
    on a cushion of intra-cranial pressure <br>
    until their skull seals.... ' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ionesco, the new message is: 'If you want to get
ahead get a hole in your head.' Perhaps the advantage is with
Tibet where prayer wheels are another way of arriving at the same
result&#151;an egoless involvement with the abyss inside the
self&#151;any fool can do it: the mechanism is external while the
mind if left vacant; and vacancy is not the worst condition of
the mind; the go, being non-existent, does not have to store,
retrieve, catalogue, analyse or identify. But perhaps the last
word can be left to Norman O. Brown, speaking of the place (and
need) for the 'transforming spirit of play' and of that great
revolutionary intellectual of the twentieth century, James Joyce:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'who reduced all that solemn nonsense to nonsense leading
    us in the path to which Wittgenstein directed us from
    disguised nonsense to patent nonsense a transition that is
    accomplished not by linguistic analysis but by poetry.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leafless trees, the cold, clear air of winter;
wide, snow-covered streets on which students wander about, whose
physical appearance is different from when I was last here. Odd,
really, how quickly the young respond to change. Whilst only
seven or eight years ago the style was teeth-and-tweeds,
button-down shirts and college ties, the mode of dress now veered
on the far side of informality&#151;jeans, denim shirts, cowboy
boots and Afghan coats; and beards and long hair were everywhere
prevalent. It was as if one psychic atmosphere had spread from
California to Italy. Millions of similar people everywhere in the
West. And their lifestyle was loose, unstructured; they seemed to
roll on like the waves, whose movement is regulated by invisible
forces emanating from the moon. They were beings who were in
possession of a secret which provided the impetus to their lives;
their aims were more inward; they had a feeling for values; they
had achieved a certain level of consciousness. Were they not
somehow more open than in any age previously, which gave them
this new amplitude and a sense of purpose? And if you were to ask
them, 'What for the future?' it is to themselves they would
point. What folly to believe in a Providence which guides life
from the outside! This is the change in itself. Where growth is
guided by conscious volition, development of the personality
takes place; everyone progresses, marches onward, further and
further, and no end is in sight. Here was a new generation for
whom time is real before eternity. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How good for the mental health of modern youth to
imbibe a little Eastern wisdom. Everybody who believes in
himself, no matter who he is, stands on a higher level than the
timorous&#151;yes, the formative power of the Brahmanic and
Buddhistic, but also the Islamic East, can help us achieve the
ideal of universal brotherhood, whereas the received teachings of
the West fail in spite of their ideals. For whatever power the
spiritual message has exerted over the minds of men has surely
come from the unique degree of involvement which it posits
between the divine and the here and now. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As I wandered the Cambridge streets, I thought of
my earlier days of largely harum-scarum activity and what had
happened to us all across these random and haphazard years of
pilgrimage. And sometimes, when I am in a reflective mood, I
wonder if there is a secret connection between spiritual
necessity and empirical accident? How is it that this strange
drug LSD had such immense consequences, and was discovered
seemingly by accident alone? For the revolution in sensibility
produced results which the LSD-users did not&#151;and perhaps
could not&#151;foresee. But this is true for all
revolutionaries&#151;revolutions have to be considered as very
complex series of actions initiated in highly particular
circumstances and at particular points in time. 'Each age gets
the revolution it deserves', is perhaps a truism, yet it is in
fact that a small change of empirical circumstances, and the
psychedelic revolution would not be the widespread manifestation
which it is. It was now possible to see that an acceleration in
our brief new renaissance had turned the Leary-Alpert streams
into a river and that the whole movement, first of Harvard
1960-61, then of the International Federation for Internal
Freedom in 1963-64 and the Castalia Foundation of 1964-67 and the
League for Spiritual Discovery of 1966-68, etc., etc., was the
result of a series of accidental circumstances in which groups of
LSD-users discovered a peculiar disposition in their thought
which allowed them to transform a triviality into a profound
spiritual belief and allowed them to appreciate individual human
existence as the living expression of metaphysical reality,
because the psychedelic experience signified the reality and the
beauty of the flower of the spirit. And thus the Age of the
Flower Children was born out of the individual experience of
transcendence, just as, in an earlier age, the Vedic <i>Soma</i>
brought the light of consciousness into the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What is the significance of the psychedelic
movement? I do not know myself. I have struggled with the problem
for years. But the facts are beyond question: the psychedelic
renaissance, like all great periods of culture, cannot be
explained altogether out of a demonstrable series of causes. If
anything, they seem to owe their existence ultimately to a
spiritual influx which bears the unmistakeable stamp of divine
grace, something given rather than made. And once the source of
inspiration has dried up, no effort and no talent is of any
avail. Further, since the height of the psychedelic impetus, the
insights have declined, in spite of all the psychedelic sessions
which have occurred through these years, and today the LSD-user
probably possesses less creative taste than any educated
non-user, although they are still spiritually the most developed.
What does this signify?&#151;I know only that LSD has decorated
the world of ideas. In what then lies LSD's unique quality, its
appeal for the person who takes it? Perhaps it is the discovery
of the existence of shades of inner meaning one would not
normally credit with the capacity for signifying so much. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let us transpose ever so slightly the elements of
visionary knowledge, or change the varieties of the spiritual, or
use a different method for gaining deeper insights; or place the
individual, as he is, into another setting which is subject to
different environmental conditions, such as, for instance, a
damp, ill-lit and unheated cave somewhere high in the Himalayas:
it would be the revelatory 'mystical' experience no longer. I
have seen such non-drug revelatory methods for getting westerners
'high' not fifty miles from Kathmandu: they lack the crystal-like
clarity or immediacy of the psychedelic experience. The
psychedelic experience makes particularly clear what the nature
of individuality really is. It must seem a pity to some that
anything could be metaphysically real which is manifestly so
dependent upon empirical circumstances, in this instance, upon a
psychedelic drug. It illustrates, on the other hand, that the
spiritual component in man can only become visible subject to
special empiric conditions. It doesn't solve the riddle of man's
spiritual nature, nor is it a key to a metaphysics of ecstasy (as
some thinkers have claimed); no matter how many causes and
relations we establish: the essential escapes us. This says
little in favour of those who incline to the belief that the
LSD-user may thus far participate of metaphysical reality. But
the visionary experience is essentially brief; once achieved and
expressed, it becomes subject, like everything else, to the
merciless downward pull of gravity and the world of three
dimensions, that non-miraculous world of appearances we call
either prison or home, which is manifest everywhere around me
even now as I type these lines. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But reality must still count for something, and
this is perhaps more true in America (than in any other country
I've ever lived in), where prosperity is regarded as normal; he
who simply contents himself, i.e. turns himself on, is regarded
as feeble. The idea that divine blessedness and prosperity are
connected is still effective today: the man who discovers Christ
within him will become rich, healthy, an accomplished individual
in this lifetime; it is a religious belief that teaches the
possibility of uniting one's struggle for the goods of this world
with ideal aspirations. The man who is pleasing to God must
become rich; the fruits, which hitherto have fallen only to the
lot of him who renounces the world, can now be shared by him who
affirms it. This is the teaching of 'a religion of democracy';
the materialism of our era is Hallowed in Thy name... </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am constantly relapsing into didactics, though
no teacher I; on the contrary, I discourage any kind of
followership, since my capacity for head-work is limited. I am
also without the necessary information. So I drift; I am that
aimless drifting man who, setting out in the first light of dawn
like a ship to sea, never knows when or with what cargo he will
return to port; and to invite anyone to follow me on such a
reckless enterprise would be akin to negligence, if not actually
actionable. One has a few friends, and of course they help
sustain one through periods of change or difficulty, but in the
final analysis, one must chart one's own drift course through the
peculiarities of our modern kind of existence. It is a situation
I once discussed with Tim Leary&#151;who confided in me his own
strategies as a mentor of modern youth, which again confirmed my
belief that he is one of the wisest, most illuminatory beings
that the world has ever known.... The main theme of his
philosophy, which he has dealt with in his book, <i>The Politics
of Ecstasy</i> is the 'seven levels of consciousness&#151;<i>solar,
cellular, somatic, sensual, symbolic, stupor</i> (emotions) and <i>sleep',</i>
what he calls 'the seven tongues of God'; 'seven dialects of
energy, each triggered by the appropriate chemical&#151;<i>LSD,
mescaline, hashish, grass, stimulants, booze, narcotics'.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary's message is that we die, creatively
speaking, when we cling too fast to the definite, and that beyond
the falsifications of egocentric consciousness lies the world of
awareness which we must locate, pry out and finally weld to our
being and in this way achieve affirmation of God, the world and
the other people in it. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The yoga of drugs is of course a key method. The sexual
    yoga is also key&#151;access to and control of sexual energy.
    Nothing can be renounced. All is God. Every energy is divine.
    All must be understood and controlled for <i>spiritual
    purposes,</i> including the yoga of power. All energy is
    available to him who accepts the basic energy formula; all
    energy is available to him who knows that it must not be
    grabbed, held, possessed or used for any other purpose except
    spiritual.' (Private correspondence.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is a beautiful message and one that could become
a proper matter of concern for a generation raised on Marx,
Dulles, Thieuing gum and Coca-Cola. It is thus not without
precedent that Leary, like Socrates before him, should be
convicted by his peers of corrupting a nation's youth, for
history, like the big wheel in a cosmic funfair, spins slowly
towards the final revolution... and mankind has not progressed
even one iota. And, most tragic of all, the protoplasm seems
happy. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing how many of the original Harvard
Psychedelic Project were working for the Corporation, it was not
too difficult to persuade the university to have me back, this
time, however, not as a four-hours-a-week instructor to
third-year graduate students in psychology but as a trainee
librarian at the Harvard University Library. The plan was that I
should work as an assistant curator of Scandinavian Aquisitions,
attend a two-year course in Library Science at Boston's Sammer's
college, and then stay on as a full librarian, with faculty
privileges; and perhaps teach one course after this probationary
period. The authorities were nervous, perhaps understandably, but
in their own way showed a remarkably liberal, open-minded
attitude about having me back. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The first few weeks were spent learning how books
were indexed and catalogued and how to find my way around the
'stacks' underneath the main library building, which is an art in
itself, for the Harvard Library (second only to the Library of
Congress in Washington) had been assembled through the years with
stolid incompetence, and I dare say that no one is entirely sure
where all the books are. Certainly in my section, the
Scandinavian language collections were catalogued in such a
manner that it could sometimes take a whole day to locate a
particular book, even for an experienced librarian. The reason
given for this odd state of affairs was that until quite recently
the Curators were usually eccentrics and not infrequently quite
possessive about 'their' books, often devising an elaborate
personal coding system to stop students borrowing them; that is,
unless you asked the Curator himself to locate the particular
book for you. But times and people change. A new breed was taking
over, as it were; soon only <i>professional</i> librarians would
be in charge. No more muddling through. Efficiency was now the
touchstone by which a librarian was to be judged. The library did
not offer a complete life, as enclosed and dedicated as a
monastery, but a career, like any other. Certainly, it <i>helped</i>
if you had a taste for books or reading, but the main thing was
knowing how to catalogue the stuff. It was even envisaged that,
in time, the entire library would be computerised, though plans
for this innovation had met with little response from the higher
'invisible' echelons who contemplated such suggestions in the
cloistered calm of their private rooms. I was told about one
Curator, in charge of Burmese Acquisitions, I think, who had been
dead in his private room for nearly two months, and was only
discovered when a student, due to some error in his walk, had
accidentally opened the door and saw this decomposing figure
huddled in a huge leather armchair. The story goes that the
student, far from being surprised at the condition of the old
man, actually asked him for directions to the Poetry Room. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The work was interesting enough, however, and I
suppose I could have stuck it out through the two-year training
period, but something happened to change my direction. Gunther
and some other friends had obtained space in a huge loft-like
building in Nutting Road near Harvard Square. It was called the
'Cambridge Readeasy'&#151;a sort of free university-cum-workshop
in 'Communication, Creativity and Awareness'. And they invited me
to run a poetry workshop involving poets and students in the
greater Boston area. This was fine as far as I was concerned for
it gave a focus to my life and an excuse to meet and hear some of
the younger poets, who I encouraged to drop around and take part
in the experiment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Readeasy soon became quite popular with the
local Underground, who kept us all well-supplied with grass and
the occasional pipe of opium. But this was not the reason why I
left Cambridge (in fact, it was probably the high quality of the
grass that was keeping me there), but the arrival of Leary for a
lecture series in Boston, when we met and he invited me to join
him in Berkeley. I was a bit hesitant at first, perhaps because I
felt more at home on the East Coast, but my curiosity got the
better of me, and a few weeks later I resigned from the library
and was jetting across America to San Francisco, where Tim picked
me up at the airport; and the start of a new adventure. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; California&#151;land of the Brave or land of the
Freaks? Tim had no doubts in his mind: 'California is at least
one year ahead of the East Coast in Aquarian life-styles,
sophistication, and enterprise. Here is where it is all
happening.' I said the weather was nice. 'Yeah; warm, sunny and
soft, just like a beautiful woman.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon we were in the city and Tim said he'd give me
a tour, starting on Fisherman's Wharf and home of some of the
best seafood restaurants in America. From there we drove along
Chinatown's Pacific Avenue and Grant Avenue, where the sole
business seemed to be food. Chinese variety shops ran like a
strip of tinsel through the heart of the city. From there we
drove up to Nob Hill, home of the rich and the elegant, where
tradition is slow to change and the residents carefully preserve
an air of bygone days while sparing no modern convenience. Then
back to Market Street where we dropped by a couple of bars before
going on to the Haight and a Japanese restaurant for lunch. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Then in the afternoon we visited Eldridge Cleaver
of the Black Panthers, a very impressive personality who was in
the middle of his campaign to become the first coloured president
of the United States. Basically, the line he presented was
something like this: 'When you vote for me you are voting for
this finger'. He would then hold up the index finger of his right
hand. 'This finger. Because this finger is the finger that
presses the button. And, man this finger ain't <i>never</i> going
to push any button. Do you trust Nixon's finger anywhere <i>near</i>
that red button? I don't. So when you vote, remember, you're
voting for the finger that won't push the button', etc., etc.
He'd been out campaigning most of the morning and seemed a bit
tired when we met him, but he welcomed Tim warmly, like an old
friend, joking and fooling, and every now and again telling Tim
that the Black Panther Party was really getting it together. A
very remarkable man, I thought. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And on to Menlo Park just south of the city to meet
Ken Kesey, who I remembered from the early Harvard days, when he
was then known as the author of <i>One Flew the Cuckoo's Nest,</i>
a brilliant novel about the goings-on inside a mental hospital.
Now he was into his political bag, and had hopes of uniting the
various hippie factions in the Bay Area into a coordinated party,
something similar to the Panther organisation, but looser,
without too many rules. Tim said that he was considering running
against Reagan as Governor of California: 'I'd strip the cops of
their guns, double their salaries and encourage them to smoke
dope. I'd also introduce a &quot;marijuana tax&quot;&#151;like
the annual automobile tax, only much higher, say, one thousand
bucks a year. And then I'd distribute the revenue amongst the
Californian middle-class. In that way, everyone would be happy.'
There were immediate and voluble objections from Ken and the
others in the apartment, 'Man, one thousand bucks to smoke weed?
You'd never get any of the heads to vote for that. Fifty bucks,
maybe. But one thousand... man, do you know how much weed you
could buy for that? Enough to keep you stoned for months. Better
think again &quot;Uncle Tim&quot; if you want to get my vote.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; An hour or so chewing the breeze, and back to San
Francisco again, to a small building across from the Panhandle
Park where 'The Messiah' lived with his commune of followers, and
the headquarters of 'The Messiah's World Dope Crusade'. There was
no reply when we knocked on the door, but it wasn't locked so we
walked in. The house was silent. Tim then opened one of the doors
leading into a huge living-room where a group of perhaps six
beautiful girls were seated in a circle on the floor holding
hands. They all seemed to be crying. No one looked up as we
entered, and Tim immediately put on a serious expression and
quietly joined this tearful circle. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a few minutes had passed, Tim asked after The
Messiah. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'He was busted this morning. The fuzz came round
and busted him for ten keys (kilograms) of grass. Man, like we
needed to raise bread on that for our new macro bakery.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Where is The Messiah now?' Tim gently asked. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Down at the Precinct, I guess. They said they'd
been watching him for weeks and that this time he'd go down for a
long time.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Why didn't he pay them off?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; ' 'Cos we'd spent all our bread on this new
consignment and only had a couple of hundred bucks or so in the
house.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Is there anything I can do?' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Just pray. That's what we're doing.' </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the way to Berkeley mention of the raid was
made on the FM news. It seemed that The Messiah had told the desk
sergeant that unless he was released that afternoon he'd have to
take 'drastic action'. He was reported as saying that he'd use
his telepathic powers to cause a two-hour traffic jam on the Bay
Bridge during the evening traffic rush. He was released on a
nominal bail, a few hours later. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon we were in Berkeley and Tim's house in Queen's
Road, high in the hills overlooking the campus and the Bay. We
made it just before the curfew&#151;the Free Speech Movement was
rioting against the Vietnam war. There had been campus revolts
every day for a week, and the police had introduced a curfew
after nightfall. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim used to refer to his house as 'The Embassy'.
There was a constant stream of visitors of all shapes, shades and
sizes, each one involved at some level with the revolutionary
Underground. And they would make their reports to Tim who'd then
comment or make suggestions or give them some LSD. I was thus
able to get a picture very quickly of what was happening in
California, mainly talk actually, though sometimes you'd meet a
veteran of some campus riot or other. I think the only really
sensible and coherent person in the area was Jerry Garcia of 'The
Grateful Dead'. 'Acid,' he used to say, 'has changed
consciousness entirely. The US has changed in the last few years
and it's because that whole first psychedelic thing meant
&quot;here's this new consciousness, this new freedom, and it's
here in yourself&quot;.' He was later to develop his thesis in a <i>Melody
Maker</i> interview... </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'I think we're beginning to develop new capacities just in
    order to be able to save the world from our trips&#151;you
    know, pollution, etc.&#151;if for nothing else. Just for
    survival. The biological news is that in 100 years from now
    life on earth is finished, so what has to happen is this
    organism has to adapt real quick and develop new capacities
    to stem this flow, to maybe head it off somehow. In this
    scheme of things, politics and all those things belong to the
    past. They're meaningless, going down the drain.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a couple of months in Berkeley, we moved to
Southern California, to a ranch in Idyllwild near the San
Bernardino Forest and the headquarters of the Brotherhood of
Eternal Love, a former Los Angeles motor-cycle gang who had taken
acid and dropped out of crime and into dope-dealing. And Tim it
was who had become their leader/guru/teacher. The ranch was sited
a couple of miles along a dirt road off the Palms-to-Pines
Highway; the hills at the back overlooked Palm Springs and the
desert. It was a beautiful place, and there were some thirty of
us living there. Tim lived in a small bungalow with his wife,
Rosemary, while I had a room in a smaller building adjacent. The
Brothers either lived in the ranch house or in small
outbuildings. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The ranch hadn't been lived in for over a year, so
there was a lot of work to be done. For my part, I built a sauna
hut, utilising a couple of old stoves for the purpose and
insulating the walls with sand. There was room inside for perhaps
half a dozen people, and we'd often retire there in the evenings
with a couple of cherry pipes filled with hashish, and sweat and
smoke until we'd either pass out or freak out in the heat. I also
worked the huge caterpillar bulldozer in an attempt to smooth out
some of the bumps in the earth road leading to the ranch, but it
kept breaking down or, perhaps due to my inexperience with
heavy-duty machinery, it would sometimes swivel off the road and
into the ditch and it could take all of us a whole day to get it
back on the road again. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The summer passed gloriously, and apart from the
occasional police helicopter hovering overhead, we were not
troubled much by contact with the outside world. There was also a
lot of good acid available, and we would celebrate each Full Moon
in the mountains, when the sessions would be run along the lines
of the Indian Peyote ceremonies&#151;that is, we'd all be seated
in a circle around a blazing fire chanting or shaking an Indian
rattle to ward off evil spirits. There would also be drums and
guitars, and sometimes one of the Brothers would dance around the
fire shouting incoherently as though touched with the 'gift of
tongues', though you'd hardly call us Pentecostal. We also tried
to communicate with flying-saucers of which many had been
reported in the skies above the ranch. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; However, by the Fall, I was again restless, this
time for a more solitary refuge, somewhere where I could simply
be, and preferably alone. I had met too many people in
California, heard too many things, maybe even taken too much
acid. Now I wanted out. And it was thus to Tonga in the South
Pacific that I went... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nine hours after leaving San Francisco, I caught my
first glimpse of the tropical islands of the South Pacific as we
flew low over Fiji. The richness of the landscape below was
overwhelming everywhere. Perfect beauty abounded, in which
meaning and expression are one. This peaceful island of lush
jungle which blossoms like flowers was surrounded by dark green
hills and encircled by a rich blue sea, as still and as peaceful
as a lake. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And then Tonga! This Other Eden of palm trees
shooting upwards to the sky, rich, luxuriant, yellow beaches and
an exquisitely blue sea lapping against the shores. When I
stepped off the plane I was so thrilled that I immediately set
off on a long walk, and when I returned, feeling weary, I
thought, as I reclined in a comfortable wicker chair on the
shaded balcony of my tiny hotel: thou art in paradise. Here
should I be; and be free from myself.... And as I looked out
across the garden over the tree tops, I saw hordes of monkeys who
pursued, in a silent tight-rope dance, their fodder for the
evening meal. How delightful it is to be in a world which was
finally created on the fifth day! Here nothing has changed, here
everything is simple and true. I was beginning to understand why
most truly great minds prefer 'nature to human society'. The
latter limits, the former liberates. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How harmonious the landscape in the light of the
sunset. The sea reflects the last light of the sky. The
screeching of the gulls high above the water and the shrill
chirping of the cicadas fills my mind as no music ever could. In
the narrow road opposite an old fisherman carries his nets; I can
hear him singing to himself, softly, to the rhythm of the
breaking waves. He is faithful to himself and to the spirit of
nature; I could believe that this solitary wayfarer understands
the doctrine of nirvana in the way in which an enlightened saint
wishes to have it understood. Here there is no striving, for
everything happens of its own accord. One's volition wanes
irresistibly. I feel in this hothouse air it is futile to work,
to wish, to strive; it is not I who think, but nature thinks in
me, it is not I who wish, but something wishes in me. For this
native fisherman, Buddha's doctrine of cognition is a matter of
course, the result not of self-determination but of his own
psychic process developing at one with nature; its truth is
something which the most cultured Westerner only very
exceptionally perceives. Here thought seems somehow superfluous;
here nothingness is the background of semblance; the intellect
turns away, as it were, from its possible content; it becomes
more and more empty, till at last no thought remains. The mind is
as bland and as blank as a bank of snow. Such simplicity of mind
signifies a form of existence which proceeds without effort. And
everything happens naturally, without conscious effort and
without the direction of the will; indeed, in the tropics the
will is so small that the wish fails to become father to the
thought. Life is thus essentially a mindless involvement with
nature, with mediocrity as the purest form of normality. Here it
is possible to achieve everything by doing nothing. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tonga itself is a collection of perhaps 150 small
islands, mostly uninhabited. It is Blessed, for it was dedicated
to Heaven at Pouono by King George Tupoul, and there is a strong
sense of the religious amongst its peoples, their faith is firmly
rooted in the worship of Christ. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I spent the first week in Nukalofa, the capital,
resembling in appearance a sort of shanty town you normally
associate with the ghetto districts of Georgia or
Alabama&#151;lots of corrugated iron and shed-like dwellings,
semi-derelict store fronts and flaked woodwork, but still
charming for all that. But I longed for isolation, for I was
impatient of humankind and wanted to live in the jungle where the
only sounds would be natural ones. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After consulting a map I decided upon Vava'u, a
tiny speck of an island some 150 miles distant from the main
island, and a two-day sail by steamer. I telephoned the Governor
to ask his permission to stay on the island, explaining that I
was a writer and needed the peace and quiet in order to write a
book. He was most gracious and hospitable, and even offered to
send his Land Rover to pick me up at the pier. Perfect. Now I
could unwind; find there my final dwelling place, and forget all
the despairs of consequence which had plagued my life in the
West. Somehow, incredibly, I had escaped from the concrete
jungles of London and New York and San Francisco, and in a
tolerably good state. Now I could begin the slow work of salvage,
become whole again, maybe even find that peace of head or heart I
had sought through all these years of largely accidental
activity. I had found an excuse for living. And I intended to
plan my own death very, very, carefully, which alone can give the
meaning to one's life. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Vava'u was all that I had anticipated; indeed more,
since it manifested itself in the form of the most delicately
sensuous natural beauty, especially in the morning, when the sea
flows in golden waves towards the rising sun; the whole island
seemed to be divinely transfused: one feels inclined, like the
pilgrims on the Ganges, to sink down every morning before the
beauty of the place in fervent gratitude. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; You can imagine my surprise, therefore, when, on my
second morning&#151;I had rented a bamboo and thatched hut a
couple of miles from the tiny port on the edge of the bush&#151;I
was awakened by the sound of pop music. Nothing could have been
more incongruous or unexpected, and I feared at first it was an
auditory hallucination. But the noise persisted, and, quickly
dressing, I followed the sound into the bush until I came to a
small hut. I knocked on the door. No answer. So I knocked again.
This time a voice, an American, answered&#151;'Who is it?'
'Friend,' I said. 'Enter, friend.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I pushed open the door and inside were three young
men dressed in jeans and sweat shirts. The air was redolent of
marijuana, and everyone appeared to be pretty stoned. I said I'd
heard the music and, curious, had followed the sound. Did they
mind if I sat down and joined them? 'Nope.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It turned out that they were members of the Peace
Corps, of which there were about 120 scattered about the islands,
seven of whom were on Vava'u. The Tongalese called them
'voluntary workers'. Some taught English in the schools, some
worked as medical assistants for the Medical Department, and some
were working as farmers. These three seemed a nice bunch of guys.
And the ice was quickly broken when I told them I was writing a
book about psychedelics. 'Did you bring any acid with you?' one
of them asked. 'I did as a matter of fact&#151;about 100 trips of
&quot;sunshine&quot;, which is about as pure as you can get. Have
any of you taken acid?' None of them had, but each said he'd like
to try some. 'How about some grass? Do you have any?' I asked.
'Sure,' one of them said passing me the plastic bag filled with
marijuana. 'Roll yourself a joint. It's great weed. We grow it
locally. It's dynamite. ' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The effect was excellent, and soon I was as stoned
as they were. Jefferson Airplane were playing on the Sony
cassette, loud and energetic, playing tight and clean, blowing
our minds. You didn't have to listen to it with great
concentration. You can just sorta drift with it. Then followed
some Grateful Dead&#151;<i>Anthem Of the Sun</i> and <i>Aoxomoxoa;</i>
very soulful and communicative, a liturgy of the hip. The music
was creating good vibes all around, with everything becoming one
music; or rather, everything inside becoming <i>all</i> music,
which is what true pop music is all about, the obliteration of
thought for sensation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One of the Peace Corps guys was really uptight
about a recent debate in the Parliament. Apparently, a member of
the Tongan Parliament had complained that they were starting
their own private businesses by growing small gardens, selling
the produce, and feeding chickens so as to sell the eggs. He said
they were trying to change Tongan customs. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Here, let me read you some of what this cat
    said&#151;&quot;Our women who used to wear a dress, the
    traditional <i>tupenu</i> and <i>ta'ovala</i> are now
    clothing themselves in one yard of cloth. Even the huge women
    use up only one yard, making it so tight that their
    sharp-shinned legs show and it makes them look thick on the
    right side and thin on the left.&quot; Crazy! Now dig this,
    &quot;When they are walking in the streets, you can't tell if
    they are coming or going! This has come from the examples set
    by the voluntary workers. All the spiritual feelings I
    experience when I am in the church vanish when these
    voluntary workers enter the church building with the clothes
    they wear. Very often I feel like getting up and throwing
    them out. Therefore I ask the Premier that if a copra boat
    should come, let us pack them all in it and send them back to
    America. Soon they will be wearing only underwear to
    church.&quot; But he got no steam from the Premier, who also
    happens to be the king's brother, Prince Tu'ipelehake. He
    really took the wind out of the sails, telling this uptight
    cat, Tu'akoi' that instead of being critical he should be
    grateful.... &quot;God made their visit possible. It is often
    a mystery that, without knowing or being acquainted with
    anyone, they are willing to sacrifice t o give such help. The
    sacrifice and usefulness have been proved today not only to
    the Government, but also to the people, the country and the
    church. Love is repaid with love, and the understanding and
    the willingness to help is the most important of all. We
    should consider such gratitude and sacrifice. I believe that
    if they have sacrificed for Tonga, not one of us here in this
    house could do more for Tonga. We should be grateful and we
    have given an oath to be rightful and loving in our work for
    His Majesty King Tupou IV and the country&quot;.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After a few days I had got to know the seven local
Peace Corps quite well. We'd spend a lot of time rapping. And
there was plenty of grass from their gardens. We also discussed
having a 'sunshine' session together, on one of the small
uninhabited islands close by. We settled on one weekend, and
taking supplies of food and water for two days, we took the
motor-boat to a small island of palm trees and golden beaches
about three miles from port. I had previously explained at some
length what sort of reaction to expect and how to overcome any
paranoia by fixing the mind on a natural object like a stone or a
coconut, or by chanting the 'Vajra Guru Mantra'&#151;OM AH HUM
VAJRA GURU PADMA SIDDHI HUM&#151;which represents the vital
essence of the 84,000 sections of the Dharma, 'and in this way
attain the <i>siddhis</i> of the wrathful deities'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The session began shortly after we landed. It was a
morning of bright golden sunlight and a clear blue sky and sea,
no sound from anywhere; a perfect setting. Soon the 'sunshine'
began to take effect, and again I was transported into the heart
of my intra-atomic self, that place of reconciliation and bliss
in which all life lives in the unity of the One. But I was unable
to stay there for long; one of the group had begun to declare
himself as Jesus Christ and insisted that we were his disciples.
And the force of his conviction, coupled with an increased
rapidity and volume of his speech, began to take over our heads
so that soon we were lost in a maze of contradictory thoughts and
feelings, expressed variously in anger, laughter, dismay and
fear. In vain I tried to get him to keep quiet, but he continued
to expatiate on the evil he saw in life and insisted that we
follow him on a crusade to save the world. Very soon the harmony
of the session was lost, and people either wandered off by
themselves or sat as if transfixed by this Christ figure,
submerged under the non-stop repetitious flow of words. As there
was nothing now I could do to silence him, I too ambled off along
the beach, just hopeful that our new Christ would talk himself
into silence by the time I got back. OM AH HUM VAJRA GURU PADMA
SIDDHI HUM I intoned as I slowly walked along the shoreline
stopping every now and again to pick up a shell or observe the
miracle of the sand turtle or the vigorous motion of tiny
crabs.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; When I got back several hours later, everyone was
there and seated around a small fire. Jesus was curiously
observing each face one after the other, as if seeking an answer
to some private question, a sort of vacant look on his face, an
expression of disbelief; but he was mercifully silent. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We slept on the beach that night, gazing at the
million sparkling stars, thinking, wondering, seeking answers to
man's age-old question 'What is the secret of this universe in
which we live?' until, exhausted, we finally fell asleep. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We returned to Vava'u the next day. The boy Jesus
seemed a little embarrassed by what he had said and done, but
soon we had him laughing at his own stupidity. He later told me
he had been a divinity school student for two years before
switching to social science, but after this 'trip' he wondered
that perhaps he ought to have stayed on and become a minister. I
told him that he could be anything he wanted, this time around.
Besides, he was probably serving God better by helping teach
Tongans how to run their social services than preaching his word
each Sunday in church. I gave him my copy of the New Jerusalem
Bible. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But it was all too good to last. Already there was
gossip on the main island about the Peace Corps growing pot on
Vava'u, and now rumour had it that they were taking LSD. This was
confirmed when I received a note from the British Consul saying
that some questions were being asked about me and the purpose of
my stay in Tonga. He was also in possession of a file from the
Foreign Office, and the local CIA had filled in a few more
details. Would I care to visit him to discuss the matter? It was
exactly one month since I first arrived in Tonga when the
Minister of Police and about a dozen detectives arrived on Vava'u
and started searching for the marijuana beds. The Peace Corps
were clearly implicated, and a cable was sent to Washington to
this effect. By return came a cable from the Peace Corps Director
asking that they return to Washington immediately, when there
would be a hearing before the committee. As for myself, I decided
to leave before I was kicked out, and soon I was on the jet, this
time for New York, where at least it was still possible to smoke
pot without getting paranoid, as now even office girls were
smoking the stuff, which meant nearly everyone in the city was. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the fellows from the Peace Corps? It seemed
that they had not returned to Washington as instructed but had
decided to live in Fiji instead, turning on the local Peace
Corps, as well as their former colleagues on holiday from Tonga.
Again and again I am surprised at the effect that LSD has on
people's lives, how it seems to change their directions or goals,
making it somehow impossible for them to exist in the formal,
structured world so favoured by the Establishment. In this case
what a few micrograms of LSD had done was to transform a bunch of
ordinary, middle-class Americans with clear-cut expectations and
achievement-motivations into missionaries of a new order, for
they were now possessed of a self, or of a self-conscious similar
to that of the mystics, <i>rishis,</i> and saints. How was such a
change accomplished? Only by the realisation of the God within,
and by the willingness to accept the validity of this vision, and
moreover by the ability to re-create this insight as immediately
in terms of a living manifestation: they have made of themselves
whatever art it is in the life of each one of them, unconcerned
with the trappings of outer forms or appearances: they live
according to an inner rhythm, not that of the metronome but of
music. They had recognised the Atman within themselves, and now
wanted to realise him in the world; they wanted to assist Brahma,
whose partial expression they believed themselves to be. </p>
