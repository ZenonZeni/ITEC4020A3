<b>Purpose</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children is an association of professional and
other persons whose principal purpose is to obtain optimal educational
opportunity for all children and youth with exceptionalities.  These
children's needs differ sufficiently fro m other children's so that they
require special educational and related services in addition to those
presently available through regular education programs and other human
service delivery systems.  While the legal criteria that define children
and youth with exceptionalities vary greatly from one governmental
jurisdiction to another, The Council for Exceptional Children is primarily
concerned about children and youth having sensory deficits, physical
disabilities, mental retardation, behavioral disorder s, communication
disorders, special learning disabilities, multiple disabilities, gifts and
talents, and children who are developmentally delayed or abused and
neglected.  Children and youth with exceptionalities are found in all
communities regardless of socioeconomic or cultural factors. (Chapter 01,
Para. 1) <p>

<b>Governmental Relations</b><p>

Public policy legislation, litigation, appropriation, regulation, and
negotiated agreements are the means by which children and youth with
exceptionalities have been guaranteed the educational opportunities of our
society.  The Council is deeply committed to the effective implementation
of existing public policy in the interest of children and youth with
exceptionalities.  In addition, The Council seeks extension and creation
of public policy in a manner which will encourage and augment quality
service pr ograms at all governmental levels.  To provide the scope and
kind of services needed, The Council endorses public policies that
strengthen and enhance instructional programs for all children and youth. 
While such general provisions should benefit the exc eptional child, The
Council believes that specific policy provisions are necessary to offer
those children and youth with exceptional needs the opportunity to develop
to their fullest potential.  In carrying out its governmental activities,
The Council wi ll be guided by the policies adopted by its members and by
the directives<p>

<b>Advocacy by Members</b><p>

The Council believes that all persons concerned about the education of
children and youth with exceptionalities must initiate and maintain
efforts to ensure that appropriate public policy is adopted, fully
implemented, and enforced. <p> The Council recognizes that the provision
of public services to children and youth with exceptionalities is a
function of the governmental process.  For this reason, The Council urges
and supports the active involvement of its members in activities that w
ill build greater awareness on the part of parents, communities, and
governmental officials regarding the needs of children and youth with
exceptionalities and will extend appropriate information to such bodies in
their efforts to carry out the objectives of this policy statement. <p>
The Council believes that it is the responsibility of all persons
concerned about the needs of children and youth with exceptionalities to
continually seek to improve government provisions for their education.  In
this regard, The Council pledges its assi stance in providing needed
information and in helping to develop the necessary strategies to attain
improvement of educational services for children and youth with
exceptionalities. <p> In our democratic societies, we have created systems
of law to protect the individual from the abuses of society, particularly
from abuses of the agencies established by society to serve its needs.  In
the attempt to provide what appear to be needed servi ces, the rights of
the individual may be overlooked.  For this reason, The Council urges
constant vigilance on the part of all persons engaged in the education of
children and youth with exceptionalities to assure that the rights of
these individuals and their families are understood and observed.  The
Council further suggests that all public programs and private programs
utilizing public funds be open to review and that flexibility be provided
to allow for judicial consideration of such matter. (Chapter 01, Para. 3)
<p>

<b>Accessibility</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children provides a physical and emotional
environment that is sensitive to the needs, feelings, and opinions of
persons with varying mobility and communication needs.  CEC makes special
efforts to encourage the participation o f members with exceptionalities
in its activities and the utilization of its services.  The Council for
Exceptional Children: <ol type=a> <li> Identifies CEC members and other
professionals with exceptionalities who would make use of communication,
accessibility, and mobility resources. <li> Facilitates communication
between professionals with exceptionalities and CEC headquarters staff.
<li> Orients CEC members and headquarters staff to the needs of
professionals with exceptionalities. <li> Informs professionals with
exceptionalities about the resources available through CEC to enable their
equitable participation in all CEC activities. <li> Guarantees that all
CEC-sponsored activities are conducted in accessible and usable facilities
and communication modes to ensure full and equitable participation of
professionals with exceptionalitites. (Chapter 01, Para. 4)</ol><p>

<center> <b><a name="3">Delivering an Appropriate Education</center><p>  

Education Is the Right of All Children</b><p>

The principle of education for all is based on democracy's philosophical
premise that every person is valuable in his or her own right and should
be afforded equal opportunities to develop his or her full potential. 
Thus, no democratic society should den y educational opportunities to any
child, regardless of the child's potential for making a contribution to
society.  Since the passage of the first public school laws in the
mid-19th century, this principle has received general endorsement and
qualified execution.  While lip service has been paid to the intent of the
principle, various interpretations of the terms "education" and "all
children" have deprived many children of their rights. <p> The ordinary
educational opportunities provided by the schools have tended to neglect
or exclude children with unusual learning needs: the gifted and talented;
those having sensory deficits, physical disabilities, mental retardation,
behavioral disorders, communication disorders, specific learning
disabilities, or multiple disabilities; and children who are
developmentally delayed or abused and neglected.  These children need
special education and, in order to be able to benefit fully from this
education, they need the opportunity to view themselves as acceptable to
society.  They need stable and supportive home lives, wholesome community
interactions, and the opportunity to view themselves and others in a
healthy manner. <p> Because of their exceptionality, many children need to
begin their school experiences at an earlier age than is customary; many
need formal educational services well into adulthood; and many require
health and social services that are closely coordinated with school
programs.  Meeting these needs is essential to the total development of
children with exceptionalities as individuals and as members of society.
<p>

For some decades now, educators and schools have been responding to the
challenges of educating children with exceptionalities.  Still, not all
children are being provided for fully; the intellectually gifted child,
for example, and many other children who need highly specialized services
are not receiving them.  The community should extend its demand that
school personnel learn to understand and serve the individual needs of
these children as well as those more easily accommodated in the
educational system.  The surge of interest among educators in
individualizing instruction hopefully will mean more sensitivity to the
educational needs of all children, and particularly those with special
needs. <p> Programs for children and youth with exceptionalities should be
varied in nature and conducted in a variety of settings, depending on the
individual needs of the child, the child's family, and the community.  It
is The Council's belief that society should have the legal responsibility
to extend the opportunity for every individual to be educated to the full
extent of his or her capacities, whatever they may be or however they may
be attenuated by special circumstances.  There is no dividing line that
excludes some children and includes others in educational programs. 
Clearly, every exceptional child has the right to a free appropriate
public education that may not in any instance be compromised because of
inadequacies in the educational system or existing public policies.
(Chapter 02, Para. 1) <p>

<b>The Relationship Between Special</b><p>

Special education is an integral part of the total educational enterprise,
not a separate order.  In any school system, special education is a means
of enlarging the capacity of the system to serve the educational needs of
all children. <p>

The particular function of special education within the schools (and the
education departments of other institutions) is to identify children with
unusual needs and to aid in the effective fulfillment of those needs. 
Both regular and special school programs play a role in meeting the
educational needs of children with exceptionalities.  A primary goal of
educators should be to help build accommodative learning opportunities for
children with exceptionalities in regular educational programs.  In the
simple mentation of this goal, special education can serve as a support
system, and special educators can assist regular school personnel in
managing the education of children with exceptionalities. <p> When the
special placement of a child is required, the aim of the placement should
be to maximize the development and freedom of the child rather than to
accommodate the regular classroom. <p> Special education should function
within and as a part of the regular, public school framework.  Within this
framework, the function of special education should be to participate in
the creation and maintenance of a total educational environment suitable

for all children. <p> From their base in the regular school system,
special educators can foster the development of specialized resources by
coordinating their specialized contributions with the contributions of the
regular school system.  One of the primary goals of special e ducators
should be the enhancement of regular school programs as a resource for all
children. (Chapter 03 Para. 1) <p>


<b>Administrative Organization</b><p>

The system of organization and administration developed for special
education should be linked with regular education (a) to increase the
capability of the total system to make more flexible responses to changes
in the behavior of individual pupils and to changing conditions in schools
and society, and (b) to permit all elements of the system to influence the
policies and programs of the others. <p> Special education must provide an
administrative organization to facilitate achievement for children with
exceptionalities of the same educational goals as those pursued by other
children.  This purpose can be achieved through structures that are
sufficiently compatible with those employed by regular education to ensure
easy, unbroken passage of children across regular-special education
administrative lines for whatever periods of time may be necessary, as
well as by structures that are sufficiently flexible to adjust quickly to
changing task demands and child growth needs. <p> The major purpose of the
special education administrative organization is to provide and maintain
those environmental conditions in schools that are most conducive to the
growth and learning of children with special needs. Under suitable
conditions, education within the regular school environment can provide
the optimal opportunity for most children with exceptionalities. 
Consequently, the system for the delivery of special education must enable
the incorporation of specia

l help and opportunities in regular educational settings.  Children should spend only as much time outside regular class settings as is necessary to control learning variables that are critical to the achievement of specified learning   goals. (Chapter   







03, Para. 2) <p>

<b>Scope of Program</b><p>

Education for children and youth with exceptionalities requires the well-planned and purposeful coordination of many disciplines.  Special education is a cross-disciplinary, problem-oriented field of services which is directed toward mobilizing and improv







ing a variety of resources to meet the educational needs of children and youth with   exceptonalities. (Chapter   03, Para. 3) <p>

<b>The Goal and Commitment of Special Education</b><p>

The fundamental purposes of special education are the same as those of regular education: the optimal development of the student as a skillful, free, and purposeful person, able to plan and manage his or her own life and to reach his or her highest potent







ial as an individual and as a member of society.  Indeed, special education developed as a highly specialized area of education in order to provide children with exceptionalities with the same opportunities as other children for a meaningful, purposeful, 







and fulfilling life. <p>
Perhaps the most important concept that has been developed in special education as the result of experiences with children with exceptionalities is that of the fundamental individualism of every child.  The aspiration of special educators is to see eve ch







ild as a unique composite of potentials, abilities, and learning needs for whom an educational program must be designed to meet his or her particular needs.  From its beginnings, special education had championed the cause of children with learning problem







s.  It is as the advocates of such children and of the concept of individualization that special education can come to play a major creative role in the mainstream of education. <p>
The special competencies of special educators are more than a collection of techniques and skills.  They comprise a body of knowledge, methods, and philosophical tenets that are the hallmark of the profession.  As professionals, special educators are dedi







cated to the optimal education of children with exceptionalities and they reject the misconception of schooling that is nothing but custodial care. <p>
The focus of all education should be the unique learning needs of the individual child as a total functioning organism.  All educators should recognize and accept that special and regular education share the same fundamental goals. <p>
Special education expands the capacity of schools to respond to the educational needs of all students. <p>
As advocates of the right of all children to an appropriate education, special educators affirm their professionalism. (Chapter 03, Para. 4) <p>

<b>Educational Environments for Exceptional Students</b><p>

Special education takes many forms and can be provided with a broad spectrum of administrative arrangements.  Children with special educational needs should be served in regular classes and neighborhood schools insofar as these arrangements are conducive 







to good educational progress.  The Council believes that the goal of educating exceptional children with non-exceptional children is desirable if the individual program is such that it will enhance the exceptional child's educational, social, emotional, a







nd vocational development. <p>
It is sometimes necessary, however, to provide special supplementary services for children with exceptionalities or to remove them from parts or all of the regular educational program.  It may even be necessary to remove some children from their homes and







 communities in order for them to receive education and related services in residential schools, hospitals, or training centers.  The Council believes that careful study and compelling reasons are necessary to justify such removal. <p>
The Council charges each public agency to ensure that a continuum of alternative placements, ranging from regular class programs to residential settings, is available to meet the needs of children with exceptionalities.<p>
Children with exceptionalities enrolled in special school programs should be given every appropriate opportunity to participate in educational, nonacademic, and extracurricular programs and services with children who are not disabled or whose disabilities







 are less severe. <p>
While special schools for children with exceptionalities and other separate educational facilities may function as part of an effective special educational delivery system, it is indefensible to confine groups of exceptional pupils inappropriately in such







 settings as a result of the failure to develop a full continuum of less restrictive programs.  The Council condemns as educationally and morally indefensible the practice of categorical isolation by exceptionality without full consideration of the unique







 needs of each student, and the rejection of children who are difficult to teach from regular school situations.  When insufficient program options exist and when decisions are poorly made, children with exceptionalities are denied their fundamental right







s to free public education.  In so acting, education authorities violate the basic tenets of our democratic societies. <p>

Like all children, children with exceptionalities need environmental stability, emotional nurturance, and social acceptance.  Decisions about the delivery of special education to children with exceptionalities should be made after careful consideration of







 their home, school, and community relationships, their personal preferences, and effects on self-concept, in addition to other sound educational considerations. (Chapter 03, Para. 5) <p>

<b>Inclusive Schools and Community Settings</b><p>
The Council for Exceptional Children believes all children, youth, and young adults with disabilities are entitled to a free and appropriate education and/or services that lead to an adult life characterized by satisfying relations with others, independen







t living, productive engagement in the community, and participation in society at large.  To achieve such outcomes, there must exist for all children, youth, and young adults a rich variety of early intervention, educational, and vocational program option







s and experiences.  Access to these programs and experiences should be based on individual educational needs and desired outcomes.  Furthermore, students and their families or guardians, as members of the planning team, may recommend the placement, curric







ulum option, and the exit document to be pursued. <p>
CEC believes that a continuum of services must be available for all children, youth, and young adults.  CEC also believes that the concept of inclusion is a meaningful goal to be pursued in our schools and communities.  In addition, CEC believes children,







 youth, and young adults with disabilities should be served whenever possible in general education classrooms in inclusive neighborhood schools and community settings.  Such settings should be strengthened and supported by an infusion of specially trained







 personnel and other appropriate supportive practices according to the individual needs of the child. <p>

<b>Policy Implications</b><p>

Schools.  In inclusive schools, the building administrator and staff with assistance from the special education administration should be primarily responsible for the education of children, youth, and young adults with disabilities.  The administrator(s) 







and other school personnel must have available to them appropriate support and technical assistance to enable them to fulfill their responsibilities.  Leaders in state/provincial and local governments must redefine rules and regulations as necessary, and 







grant school personnel greater authority to make decisions regarding curriculum, materials, instructional practice, and staffing patterns.  In return for greater autonomy, the school administrator and staff should establish high standards for each child, 







youth, and young adult, and should be held accountable for his or her progress toward outcomes. <p>


Communities.  Inclusive schools must be located in inclusive communities; therefore, CEC invites all educators, other professionals, and family members to work together to create early intervention, educational, and vocational programs and experiences tha







t are collegial, inclusive, and responsive to the diversity of children, youth, and young adults.  Policy makers at the highest levels of state/ provincial and local government, as well as school administration, also must support inclusion in the educatio







nal reforms they espouse.  Further, the policy makers should fund programs in nutrition, early intervention, health care, parent education, and other social support programs that prepare all children, youth, and young adults to do well in school.  There c







an be no meaningful school reform, nor inclusive schools, without funding of these key prerequisites.  As important, there must be interagency agreements and collaboration with local governments and business to help prepare students to assume a constructi







ve role in an inclusive community.<p>


Professional Development.  Finally, state/provincial departments of education, local educational districts, and colleges and universities must provide high-quality preservice and continuing professional development experiences that prepare all general edu







cators to work effectively with children, youth, and young adults representing a wide range of abilities and disabilities, experiences, cultural and linguistic backgrounds, attitudes, and expectations.  Moreover, special educators should be trained with a







n emphasis on their roles in inclusive schools and community settings.  They also must learn the importance of establishing ambitious goals for their students and of using appropriate means of monitoring the progress of children, youth, and young adults. 







(Chapter 03, Para. 6)<p>


<b>Individualized Education Programs</b><p>

The creation and operation of a series of alternative settings for exceptional persons to live their lives and to develop to the greatest degree possible requires that service providers continuously strive to deliver the highest quality services possible.







  The Council believes that the central element for the delivery of all the services required by a person with an exceptionality must be an individually designed program.  Such a program must contain the objectives to be attained, resources to be allocate







d, evaluation procedures and time schedule to be employed, and a termination date for ending the program and procedure for developing a new one.  The process for developing an individualized program must adhere to all the procedural safeguards of due proc







ess of law and must involve the individual person and his or her family, surrogate, advocate, or legal representative. (Chapter 03, Para. 8)<p>


<b>Labeling and Categorizing of Children</b><p>

The field of special education is concerned with children who have unique needs and with school programs that employ specialized techniques.  As the result of early attitudes and programs that stressed assistance for children with severe disabilities, the







 field developed a vocabulary and practices based on the labeling and categorizing of children.  In recent decades, labeling and categorizing were extended to children with milder degrees of exceptionality.  Unfortunately, the continued use of labels tend







s to rigidify the thinking of all educators concerning the significance and purpose of special education and thus to be dysfunctional and even harmful for children.<p>
Words such as "defective," "disabled," "retarded," "impaired," "disturbed," and "disordered," when attached to children with special needs, are stigmatic labels that produce unfortunate results in both the children and in the community's attitudes toward 







the children.  These problems are magnified when the field organizes and regulates its programs on the basis of classification systems that define categories of children according to such terms.  Many of these classifications are oriented to etiology, pro







gnosis, or necessary medical treatment rather than to educational classifications.  They are thus of little value to the schools.  Simple psychometric thresholds, which have sometimes been allowed to become pivotal considerations in educational decision m







aking, present another set of labeling problems.<p>
Special education's most valuable contribution to education is its specialized knowledge, competencies, values, and procedures for individualizing educational programs for individual children, whatever their special needs.  Indeed, special educators at th







eir most creative are the advocates of children who are not well served by schools except through special arrangements.  To further the understanding of and programming for such children, special educators as well as other educational personnel should eli







minate the use of simplistic categorizing.<p>
No one can deny the importance of some of the variables of traditional significance in special education such as intelligence, hearing, and vision.  However, these variables in all their complex forms and degrees must be assessed in terms of educational r







elevance for a particular child.  Turning them into typologies that may contribute to excesses in labeling and categorizing children is indefensible and should be eliminated.<p>
In the past, many legislative and regulatory systems have specified criteria for including children in an approved category as the starting point for specialized programming and funding.  This practice places high incentives on the labeling of children an







d undoubtedly results in the erroneous placement of many children.
It is desirable that financial aids be tied to educational programs rather than to children and that systems for allocating children to specialized programs be much more open than in the past.
Special educators should enhance the accommodative capacity of schools and other educational agencies to serve children with special needs more effectively.  In identifying such children, special educators should be concerned with the identification of th







eir educational needs, not with generalized labeling or categorizing of children.<p>
Decisions about the education of children should be made in terms of carefully individualized procedures that are explicitly oriented to children's developmental needs.<p>
To further discourage the labeling and categorizing of children, programs should be created on the basis of educational functions served rather than on the basis of categories of children served.
Regulatory systems that enforce the rigid categorization of pupils as a way of allocating them to specialized programs are indefensible.  Financial aid for special education should be tied to specialized programs rather than to finding and placing childre







n in those categories and programs. (Chapter 03, Para. 12)<p>

<center> <b><a name="4">Coordinating Responsibilities with Government<br> and <br>Community Representatives</b></center> <p>



<b>Government Responsibilities for <br>Special Education in Intermediate <br>and Local School Districts</b><p>

Intermediate and local school districts carry major responsibility for the quality of educational services to children and youth with exceptionalities and for leadership and coordination with other agencies to achieve comprehensive child centered services







.  Intermediate and local school districts should provide continuing leadership for all educational services in the community, including participation in the financing of every education program in the district and of any program outside the district whic







h serves children and youth with exceptionalities at the district's request.<p>
The Council believes that school districts should be responsible for an annual review of children and youth with exceptionalities who are legal residents of the district to assure that their education is proceeding adequately, even though they may be rece







iving their educational services outside their district of residence. (Chapter 02, Para. 2)<p>

<b>State or Provincial Governments</b><p>

The basic responsibility for guaranteeing an education to all children rests with state or provincial governments through their state or provincial education agencies; however, the fulfillment of this responsibility is effected in cooperation with federal







 and local education authorities.  The Council believes that it is the responsibility of the state/ province to guarantee each child comprehensive educational opportunities without cost to the child or the child's family.  Special financial support should







 be offered to the intermediate and local districts or combinations of these units so that no excess local cost is involved in providing specialized quality programs, services, and facilities.  While the cost of services for children and youth with except







ionalities varies greatly, such considerations should not affect the goal of optimal programming for every child.  The Council believes that no financial incentive should be provided to encourage the adoption of a less than optimal education program.  A p







articular responsibility of state/ province governments is to provide progressive leadership and direction to coordinated state/provincial programs of special education and to provide coordination among the several departments of government other than edu







cation which may be called upon to serve children and youth with exceptionalities and their families. (Chapter 02, Para. 3)<p>


<b>Federal Governments of the<br> United States and Canada</b><p>

The Council believes the federal government should give major attention to guaranteeing educational opportunities to children and youth whose education has been neglected.  The federal government has a responsibility for assuring that the rights of childr







en with exceptionalities are not violated.  Because education of children and youth with exceptionalities has, in general, been a neglected area, special categories of support should be directed to meeting their needs.  Federal financial aid should be dir







ected to state or provincial governments for the education of children with exceptionalities.<p>


The federal government should provide for support of professional leadership in the field of special education with emphasis on assessment of needs, planning of needed programs, preparation of personnel, and research.<p>
The federal government should provide financial support to colleges, universities, and other appropriate agencies to assist in operating programs to prepare all needed personnel to conduct comprehensive special education programs and services.<p>
The federal government should provide financial support to school districts and combinations of school districts that wish to provide innovative or exemplary programs for children and youth with exceptionalities or that, for any reason, enroll an unusuall







y high proportion of children and youth with special needs.<p>
The federal government should provide major support to programs in the field of special education that serve regional or national needs such as the education of migrant children.<p>
In instances where the federal government assumes primary responsibility for the education of a group of children (i.e., American Indian and Alaska Native children in Bureau of Indian Affairs operated and contracted schools and the education of dependents







 in Department of Defense schools and programs), it must also provide appropriate special education to these groups.  As one means of accomplishing this goal, the Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, should maintain a specific budget line ite







m for special education and related services for children with exceptionalities. (Chapter 02, Para. 4)<p>



<b>Intergovernmental Planning</b><p>

The success of the functions of federal, state/provincial, and local government requires close cooperative planning of a short- and long-term nature.  Such planning requires excellence in communicative skills and facilities.  Such plans for the education 







of children and youth with exceptionalities should form the basis for new and improved legislative and government policies at all levels of government. (Chapter 02, Para. 5)<p>


<b>Liaison with Other Agencies <br>and Organizations</b><p>

Children and youth with exceptionalities and their families require the services of many agencies that deal with their various needs.  In most cases, individual agency efforts can be made more effective through a cooperative interagency and interdisciplin







ary approach whereby special education has a primary function for liaison with other agencies and organizations.  This approach will not only encourage a consistent effort on the part of all concerned with the child's education and development, but will p







rovide for joint establishment of the priorities and respective responsibilities for meeting the child's needs.  Public policy should be encouraged at the state, provincial, and federal levels for a coordinated approach to multifunded projects under one a







pplication procedure to ensure comprehensive services to the child.  Such policies should support and facilitate intergovernmental cooperation as well as interagency linkage.  The Council encourages policies that promote a coordinated approach to planning







 for the needs of children and youth with exceptionalities and that strengthen the relationships of special education to public and private agencies providing services.  The Council at all levels should consistently support a coordinated effort. (Chapter 







05, Para. 1)<p>


<b>Public Participation</b><p>

Administrative units at all levels of government responsible for providing leadership must have responsibility for developing policy regarding the education of children and youth with exceptionalities.  However, such policy must reflect the thinking of al







l persons involved in the education of children and youth with exceptionalities.  The Council believes that advisory committees can help government agencies assess problems, plan and set priorities, and develop and oversee policies regarding the education







 of children and youth with exceptionalities.  The Council further believes that all policies involving education of children and youth with exceptionalities should be brought before recurring public and legislative scrutiny. (Chapter 05, Para. 2)<p>


<b>The School and the Family</b><p>

Parents must have access to all available necessary information in order to be able to make optimal decisions about the child's education and to fulfill the family's obligations to the child.<p>
As a means of strengthening special education programs, the parents of children with exceptionalities and organized community groups should be given a responsible voice in educational policy formation and planning activities.<p>
The primary consumers of educational services, the children, should not be ignored as a valuable resource in the evaluation of the organization and delivery of services.<p>
As a means of strengthening the family in fulfilling its obligations to children with exceptional needs, the schools should provide educationally-related counseling and family services.  In cases of clear educational neglect, the schools, through qualifie







d professional personnel, should make extraordinary arrangements for educational services.<p>
Access includes making information available at convenient times and locations and providing information in the parent's native language or mode of communication whenever necessary. (Chapter 05, Para. 3)<p>


<b>Private Sector</b><p>

The private sector (nonprofit) has long played a significant role in the field of special education.  The elements of the private sector (nonprofit) are varied and encompass the full gamut of levels of educational programs and services from preschool educ







ation through higher education, research, demonstration projects, personnel training, technology, and the development and production of media and materials.  Increasingly, a working relationship has developed between the public and private sectors (nonpro







fit) regarding children and youth with exceptionalities.<p>
The Council believes that private enterprise (nonprofit) can make major contributions to the development of adequate special education services. The Council urges cooperation between government and private enterprise (nonprofit) to meet the needs of child







ren and youth with exceptionalities.  The Council urges that legislation be flexible enough to allow administrative agencies to involve the private sector (nonprofit) in all aspects of program development.<p>
The Council believes that the opportunity for all children to receive an education is a public responsibility, but that program operation of such services may be conducted in varied settings and through a variety of public and private (nonprofit) agencies







.  For this reason, The Council supports the development and provision of special services in both the public and private sectors (nonprofit) and the support for such services through public funds, under public control and supervision.<p>
The Council believes that when children with exceptionalities receive their education in the private sector (nonprofit) as a matter of public policy, then the appropriate state public agency shall approve the education program and personnel in such facili







ties, certify that the program is appropriate to the child's educational needs and is provided at no expense to the child or his family, certify that the facility meets appropriate health and safety standards, and guarantee that all rights of children wit







h exceptionalities and their families are maintained. (Chapter 05, Para. 4)<p>

<center> <b><a name="5">Responsibilities of the <br>School Administration</b></center><p>


<b>Responsibility Defined</b><p>

Responsibility for administering special education programs should be clearly defined so that accountability for service effectiveness can be maintained.<p>
In the administration of the special education system, it must be clarified (a) who is to be responsible for various functions and decisions and (b) what procedures can be developed to provide adequate protection of the individual child's rights.  When se







rvices that are essential to the improvement of a child's condition are rendered under several administrative auspices, as is so often the case with children and youth with exceptionalities, which agent or agency is to be responsible for providing which a







spects of treatment needs to be clearly defined at every level to produce the most effective outcomes for the child.<p>
The major functions commonly assigned to administrators of special education programs include the following:<p>
<ol type=a>

<li>	Establishing and maintaining effective ways of identifying children with special education needs.
<li>	Assessing the special needs of children to determine what kinds of special programs and services should be provided for them.
<li>	Planning and organizing an appropriate variety of interventions or program alternatives for children with exceptionalities.
<li>	Marshalling the resources needed to conduct a comprehensive program of special education.
<li>	Using direction, coordination, and consultation as required to guide the efforts of all those who are engaged in the special education enterprise.
<li>	Conducting evaluation and research activities to reflect new emphases and to incorporate new knowledge and constantly improve special instruction and the quality of special services.
<li>	Involving community representatives in planning programs to ensure their understanding and support.
<li>	Conducting programs for staff development, such as inservice or continuing education. (Chapter 04, Para. 1)

</ol><p>
<b>Leadership</b><p>

The Council urges state/provincial and local education agencies to develop administrative structures on a policy-making level and to staff such programs with professionally qualified personnel who can provide dynamic leadership.  Creative leadership at al







l levels of government is imperative for the development and improvement of programs for children and youth with exceptionalities.  For this reason, The Council supports efforts to improve the quality of leadership and administrative operations in all pha







ses of educational endeavor. (Chapter 04, Para. 2)<p>


<b>Administrative Hierarchy</b><p>

Every school system should contain a visible central administrative unit for special education programs and services that is at the same administrative hierarchical level as other major instructional program units.<p>
The parameters of regular and special education should be articulated so that children may be afforded equal educational opportunity through the resources of either or both instructional programs.<p>
Such articulation should be achieved through sensitive negotiations between the responsible agents of both regular and special education who meet in full parity.  To protect the rights of all children to equal educational opportunity, the policymaking bod







ies of school systems should include administrators of both regular and special education.<p>
Programs to meet the needs of children with exceptionalities are no less important than those designed to meet the needs of other children.  The importance of programs to meet human needs should not be judged on the basis of the number of clients the prog







rams are expected to serve. (Chapter 04, Para. 3)<p>


<b>Special Education and School Budgets</b><p>

Success of all education programs is dependent on the provision of adequate funding.  This is essentially true of programs for children and youth with exceptionalities.  Often funding for such programs becomes buried in general budgeting procedures.  In s







uch cases, children and youth with exceptionalities do not have the opportunity to have their needs directly considered by the decision-making bodies of government.  Therefore, The Council urges that efforts be undertaken to assure that budgetary provisio







ns for children and youth with exceptionalities be clearly identified.  The Council opposes general funding procedures that would circumvent direct aid to programs for children and youth with exceptionalities.<p>
Since children with exceptionalities have the same rights to education as other children, the educational needs of children with exceptionalities cannot be delayed until the needs and service demands of the majority of children have been satisfied.  Educa







tional resources are always likely to be finite.  The application of the principle of "the greatest good for the greatest number" to determine which children's needs shall be met first directly contradicts our democratic society's declared commitment to e







qual educational opportunity for all children.  History confirms that the social injustices and ill effects that flow from the application of the majority-first principle to educational budgeting are too serious for this principle to be used in educationa







l financing.<p>
Children with exceptionalities constitute a minority of the school population.  The programs serving them represent a comparatively high financial investment in relation to the numbers of children served.  In some school systems, money allocated to specia







l education is regarded as an alternative to the improvement of regular school programs.  The climate of competitive interests thus produced can jeopardize the stability of special education services.<p>
The interests of the community are ill served if competition for funds is conducted on the basis of special interests.  What is needed, rather, is the cooperation of both regular and special educators to educate the public in the desirability of meeting t







he needs of all children without discrimination or favoritism.<p>
There is every reason to believe that the public interest is best protected when the responsibility for the deployment of public resources is placed in the hands of persons who are qualified by training and experience to make the necessary judgments.  Thu







s, special education should play an active role in determining how resources are to be allocated.  However, the community has the ultimate responsibility to determine goals and to evaluate performance.<p>
Resources should be allocated to special education on the basis of programs to be provided, not on the basis of traditional categorical incidence estimates.<p>
The mandate to provide all children with equal educational opportunities requires that all educators, whether regular or special, be equally concerned with the funding of both regular and special education programs.  No school system can fulfill the manda







te if rivalries for dollars are permitted to supersede the needs of children. (Chapter 04, Para. 4)<p>

Children in April 1983.<p>


<center> <b><a name="6">School Attendance</b></center><p>


<b>Compulsory Services <br>and Attendance</b><p>

The provision for universal education of children in a democratic society has been translated as a commitment to providing educational opportunities for every child, whatever may be his or her socioeconomic status; cultural or racial origins; physical, in







tellectual, or emotional status; potential contribution to society; and educational needs.  This commitment to every child thus includes a commitment to children with unusual learning needs and to those with outstanding abilities and talents.  Although pr







oviding education for these children may require a variety of specialized services and instructional programs, some costly and some requiring radical innovations in traditional educational structures, there is no basis for including some children and excl







uding others where the principle of universal education is concerned.<p>

Some of the specialized services that may be essential if children with exceptionalities are to attend school include the provision of specialized transportation, functional architectural environments, personalized equipment and aids, individualized instr







uctional programs, and special education and support personnel.  Certainly the fiscal requirements for such programs may be great; if they are not instituted and maintained, however, the cost of neglect is infinitely greater and must be borne mainly by th







e children as well as by their families, communities, and society as a whole.<p>
The commitment to education for all encompasses the responsibility for providing special forms of education to children and youth with exceptional characteristics and needs.  This responsibility extends to all types of exceptionalities, regardless of the 







degree to which a child may eventually be able to contribute to society.  To this end, The Council supports efforts to eliminate exclusionary clauses in compulsory school attendance laws and other such laws and administrative practices which deny children







 and youth with exceptionalities the educational opportunity they require. (Chapter 02, Para. 6)<p>


<b>Maintenance of Attendance:<br> School Exemption, Exclusion, Suspension, or Expulsion</b><p>

The school's commitment to compulsory, universal education has often been circumvented by the indiscriminate use of exemption, exclusion, and expulsion.  Children with exceptionalities have frequently been excluded from schools on the unacceptable grounds







 that they were uneducable, had undesirable characteristics, or disrupted the education of other children.<p>
Legal decisions in recent years have emphasized the right of children to attend school unless their presence is provably harmful to others.  Other decisions have enunciated the doctrine that children have a legal right to education and therefore cannot be







 excluded from all or part of school activities without legal procedures.<p>
Although children are normally exempted from school for routine reasons of illness or family arrangements, long-term exemptions should be permitted only under extraordinary conditions and should be under continual review.<p>
Since no child's right to an education may be legally abrogated, the exclusion of any child on the ground that no facilities are available for that child cannot be tolerated.  For several decades, the trend in state and provincial laws has been to develop







 special education services at local levels.  Special programs for a small number of children with exceptionalities that may seem impractical can often be made possible by innovative approaches and uses of available regular and consultative personnel.<p>
<b>Policy:</b>	The exemption, exclusion, suspension, or expulsion of children from all or part of school activities should not be permitted except under extraordinary conditions and with due acknowledgment of their legal rights.  In such cases, appropriat







e levels of alternative instruction should be available.<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	All exclusions should be for stated periods of time and should include definite provisions for admitting or readmitting the child to school.
<li>	A child so excluded should remain the continuing responsibility of the schools.  During the period in which the student is not in school, plans to modify the child's behavior and meet with parents and others to review the appropriateness of the progr







am are encouraged so that the child can be readmitted as soon as possible.
<li>	Outside agencies should be involved when necessary to facilitate readmission.
<li>	An accurate register should be maintained by local school agencies and by state or provincial agencies of all children exempted, excluded, suspended, or expelled from all of parts of school programs and the reasons for the excluding action.
<li>	To prevent the exclusion of children with exceptionalities from local schools, state and provincial agencies should assess the gaps and needs in community services and cooperate with local schools in filling them.</ol><p>

When behavior triggering disciplinary action is not related to a student's exceptionality or to the provision or lack of provision of special education or related services, an education agency may suspend or expel a student who has a disability using the 







agency's standards and procedures applicable to students who are not disabled. (Chapter 02, Para. 7)<p>

<center> <b><a name="7">Creating an Environment of Support<br> and Accountability</b></center><p>


<b>Due Process Protections<br> (Procedural Safeguards)</b><p>

As a final component of quality control, The Council believes that no decisions can be made on behalf of any individual without strict adherence to due process of law.  Most significant is our position that all individuals are entitled to adequate represe







ntation when such decisions are being made.  We support the increasing efforts on the part of governments to officially require the assignment of a surrogate when a family member is not available for purposes of adequately representing the interests of th







e person with an exceptionality.  Ultimately, however, whenever possible, a member of the individual's family provides the most desirable representation.  It is also our position that the individual consumer must be given every opportunity to make his or 







her own decisions, that this is a right provided to all citizens, and that any abridgment of that individual right can only occur upon the proper exercise of law. (Chapter 03, Para. 9)<p>


<b>Confidentiality</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children urges members to adhere to ethical principles and act in compliance with laws and regulations that protect children and their family's right to privacy and that control the use of confidential information regarding chi







ldren. (Chapter 03, Para. 10)<p>


<b>Program Evaluation</b><p>

Programs designed for the purpose of providing educational opportunities for children and youth with exceptionalities must not be viewed as static, for the end product must always be the exceptional child and his or her personal improvement.  For this rea







son, all programs should contain plans to evaluate their effectiveness, and the results of such evaluations should be presented for public review.<p>
The Council believes that all legislation to fund existing programs or create new programs should contain mechanisms for effective evaluation and that governmental advisory bodies should review the findings of evaluations on a regular basis.  External as 







well as internal systems of evaluation should be developed to aid in the evaluation of programs for children and youth with exceptionalities. (Chapter 03, Para. 11)<p>


<b>Surgical and Chemical Interventions to<br> Control the Behavior of Human Beings</b><p>

The Council condemns the inappropriate use of surgical and chemical interventions to control the behavior of human beings.  Although these procedures often simplify care and maintenance, the integrity of the individual must transcend any institution's des







ire for administrative convenience.  The Council recognizes that in certain circumstances such interventions may be appropriate; however, they should never be used without the approval of the individual to be treated, or the individual's parents or guardi







ans, or, in circumstances where the individual is a ward of the state, the approval of an appropriate review body before which the individual or his or her representatives are guaranteed all legal due-process rights. (Chapter 03, Para. 15)<p>


<b>Physical Intervention</b><p>

The Council recognizes the right to the most effective educational strategies to be the basic educational right of each special education child.  Furthermore, The Council believes that the least restrictive positive educational strategies should be used, 







as it relates to physical intervention, to respect the child's dignity and personal privacy.  Additionally, The Council believes that such interventions shall assure the child's physical freedom, social interaction, and individual choice.  The interventio







n must not include procedures that cause pain or trauma.  Intervention techniques must focus not only on eliminating a certain undesirable behavior, but also upon a determination of the purpose of that behavior, and the provision/instruction of a more app







ropriate behavior.  Lastly, behavior intervention plans must be specifically described in the child's written educational plan with agreement from the education staff, the parents and, when appropriate, the child.<p>
The Council recommends that physical intervention be used only if all the following requirements are met:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	The child's behavior is dangerous to herself/himself or others, or the behavior is extremely detrimental to or interferes with the education or development of the child.
<li>	Various positive reinforcement techniques have been implemented appropriately and the child has repeatedly failed to respond as documented in the child's records.
<li>	It is evident that withholding physical intervention would significantly impede the child's educational progress as explicitly defined in his or her written educational plan.
<li>	The physical intervention plan specifically will describe the intervention to be implemented, the staff to be responsible for the implementation, the process for documentation, the required training of staff and supervision of staff as it relates to 







the intervention, and when the intervention will be replaced.
<li>	The physical intervention plan will become a part of the written educational plan.
<li>	The physical intervention plan shall encompass the following provisions:</ol><p>
<ol>
<li>	A comprehensive analysis of the child's environment including variables contributing to the inappropriate behavior.
<li>	The plan to be developed by a team including professionals and parents/guardians, as designated by state/provisional and federal law.
<li>	The personnel implementing the plan shall receive specific training congruent with the
contents of the plan and receive ongoing supervision from individuals who are trained and skilled in the techniques identified in the plan.
<li>	The health and medical records of the child must be reviewed to ensure that there are no physical conditions present that would contraindicate the use of the physical intervention proposed.
<li>	The impact of the plan on the child's behavior must be consistently evaluated, the results documented, and the plan modified when indicated.

</ol><p>
The Council supports the following prohibitions:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	Any intervention that is designed to, or likely to, cause physical pain.
<li>	Releasing noxious, toxic or otherwise unpleasant sprays, mists, or substances in proximity to the child's face.
<li>	Any intervention that denies adequate sleep, food, water, shelter, bedding, physical comfort, or access to bathroom facilities.
<li>	Any intervention that is designed to subject, used to subject, or likely to subject the individual to verbal abuse, ridicule, or humiliation, or that can be expected to cause excessive emotional trauma.
<li>	Restrictive interventions that employ a device or material or objects that simultaneously immobilize all four extremities, including the procedure known as prone containment, except that prone containment may be used by trained personnel as a limited







 emergency intervention.
<li>	Locked seclusion, unless under constant surveillance and observation.
<li>	Any intervention that precludes adequate supervision of the child.
<li>	Any intervention that deprives the individual of one or more of his or her senses.</ol><p>

The Council recognizes that emergency physical intervention may be implemented if the child's behavior poses an imminent and significant threat to his or her physical well-being or to the safety of others.  The intervention must be documented and parents/







guardians must be notified of the incident.<p>
However, emergency physical intervention shall not be used as a substitute for systematic behavioral intervention plans that are designed to change, replace, modify, or eliminate a targeted behavior.<p>


Furthermore, The Council expects school districts and other educational agencies to establish policies and comply with state/provincial and federal law and regulations to ensure the protection of the rights of the child, the parent/guardian, the education







 staff, and the school and local educational agency when physical intervention is applied. (Chapter 03, Para. 16)<p>


<b>Corporal Punishment</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children supports the prohibition of the use of corporal punishment in special education.  Corporal punishment is here defined as a situation in which all of the following elements are present: an authority accuses a child of v







iolating a rule and seeks from the child an explanation, whereupon a judgment of guilt is made, followed by physical contact and pain inflicted upon the child.  The Council finds no conditions under which corporal punishment so defined would be the treatm







ent of choice in special education. (Chapter 03, Para. 17)<p>


<b>Child Abuse and Neglect</b><p>

The Council recognizes abused and neglected children as children with exceptionalities.  As professionals concerned with the physical, emotional, and mental well-being of children, educators must take an active role in the protection of children from abus







e and neglect.  The Council reminds its members and citizens in general of the availability of assault and battery statutes and calls upon its members to utilize such statutes when applicable in cases of child abuse.  When child abuse occurs, swift action







 must be taken to report the incident and protect the child.  Delays caused by not knowing what to do or failure to take action, contribute to the child's injury.  Educators and related personnel are urged to learn how to recognize and report child abuse 







and neglect and to know the community resources for treating suspected cases. (Chapter 03, Para. 18)<p>


<b>Staff Preparation for Placement</b><p>

Essential to the appropriate placement of the child with an exceptionality is the preparation of the environment for that child through preservice and/ or inservice training of staff and any other necessary accommodations.<p>

Teacher training institutions are challenged to instruct all teacher candidates about current trends in the education of exceptional children.<p>
State and provincial departments of education are charged with the responsibility to promote inservice activities that will update all professional educators and provide ongoing, meaningful staff development programs.<p>
Administrators can have a significant positive influence upon the professional lives of teaching staff and, therefore, upon the educational lives of children.  Administrative personnel of school districts are, therefore, charged with the responsibility to







 promote inservice education and interprofessional exchanges that openly confront contemporary issues in the education of all children. (Chapter 03, Para. 7)<p>



<b>Treatment of Exceptional <br>Persons in Textbooks</b><p>

The Council proposes the following points as guidelines for early childhood, elementary, secondary, and higher education instructional materials so they more accurately and adequately reflect persons with exceptionalities as full and contributing members 







of society.<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>	In print and nonprint educational materials, 10% of the contents should include or represent children or adults with an exceptionality.
<li>	Representation of persons with exceptionalities should be included in materials at all levels (early childhood through adult) and in all areas of study.
<li>	The representation of persons with exceptionalities should be accurate and free from stereotypes.
<li>	Persons with exceptionalities should be shown in the least restrictive environment.  They should be shown participating in activities in a manner that will include them as part of society.
<li>	In describing persons with exceptionalities, the language used should be nondiscriminatory and free from value judgments.
<li>	Persons with exceptionalities and persons without exceptionalities should be shown interacting in ways that are mutually beneficial.
<li>	Materials should provide a variety of appropriate role models of persons with exceptionalities.
<li>	Emphasis should be on uniqueness and worth of all persons, rather than on the differences between persons with and without exceptionalities.
<li>	Tokenism should be avoided in the representation of persons with exceptionalities. (Chapter 03, Para. 21)</ol><p>


<b>Technology</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children recognizes that the appropriate application and modification of present and future technologies can improve the education of exceptional persons.  CEC believes in equal access to technology and supports equal education







al opportunities for technology utilization by all individuals.  Present technologies include electronic tools, devices, media, and techniques such as
<ol type=a>
<li>computers and microprocessors;
<li>	radio, television, and videodisc systems;
<li>	information and communication systems;
<li>	robotics; and (e) assistive and prosthetic</ol><p>
equipment and techniques.  The Council believes in exploring and stimulating the utilization of these technologies in school, at home, at work, and in the community.<p>

CEC encourages the development of product standards and consumer education that will lead to the appropriate and efficient matching of technological applications to individual and local conditions.  CEC recognizes the need to communicate market needs and 







market expectations to decision makers in business, industry, and government.<p>
CEC supports the continuous education of professionals who serve exceptional individuals, through 
(a) collection and dissemination of state-of-the-art information, 
(b) professional development, and 
(c) professional preparation of personnel to perform educational and other services for the benefit of exceptional individuals. (Chapter 03, Para. 22)<p>

<center><b><a name="8">Early Childhood</b></center><p>


<b>Responsibility of the Schools for <br>Early Childhood Education</b><p>

Schools have traditionally assumed educational responsibility for children beginning at about age 5 or 6 and ending with late adolescence.  Increasingly, it is apparent that formal educational experiences at earlier ages would pay rich dividends in the fu







ll development of the capabilities of many children with exceptionalities.  Special educators have useful knowledge and many techniques for working with very young children with exceptionalities.  What is needed is the identification of children who could







 benefit from early education and the actual implementation of programs.<p>
Communities should make their schools responsible for conducting search and census operations through which children who may need specialized education at very early ages can be identified.  The voluntary enrollment of such children by their parents is in







adequate because many parents may not be aware of the child's special needs or of available forms of assistance.  Procedures for child study that encourage adaptations to the particular needs of very young children with exceptionalities are an important p







art of early education programs.<p>
Schools should provide educational services for individuals according to their needs and regardless of age.<p>
Schools should actively seek out children who may have specialized educational needs in the first years of their lives.  A particular commitment should be made to initiate homecare training programs for parents of infants with special needs, to establish 







specialized early childhood and kindergarten programs, and to utilize specialized components of regular early education programs to serve children with exceptionalities. (Chapter 02, Para. 8)<p>



<b>Services to Children with Exceptionalities<br> Ages Birth Through Five</b><p>

The provision of services to children with exceptionalities from birth through 5 years of age must 
be made a priority.  It is the premise of The Council that lack of such services currently represents the most serious impediment to the development of children with exceptionalities.  There is mounting evidence of the effectiveness of programs for very y







oung children with exceptionalities and their families.<p>
Services to young children with exceptionalities are presently provided by a variety of systems at national, state, provincial, and local levels.  There is little systematic coordination between agencies, and major service gaps remain unfilled.  A nationa







l initiative is needed to establish plans for systematic coordination among the social, educational, and health agencies currently serving children with exceptionalities from birth through 5 years in order to ensure maximum benefits for these children and







 their families, and to plan for the future provision of additional programs to fill major gaps in service to this population.<p>
Wide variations in service arrangements are necessary to meet the individual needs of children.  The Council strongly supports the principle that services for young children with exceptionalities, whenever appropriate, be provided in a context that includ







es children without exceptionalities.  Effective integrated experiences can further the development of children with exceptionalities and also can form the roots of respect for diversity in all children.  Since the success of integrated programs relies he







avily on the provision of specialized teacher training and supportive resources, the importance of such supports should be reflected in legislative and funding directives.<p>
In expanding services for children with exceptionalities from birth through 5 years, it is essential that the central role of the parent in the young child's development be recognized.  Programs must be designed to incorporate parental participation and t







o provide support for families in their role as the child's primary care provider.  The training of teachers of young children with exceptionalities should be expanded to include skills in working with parents in mutually helpful ways so that parental and







 agency efforts in helping the child are strengthened. (Chapter 02, Para. 9)<p>

<center><b><a name="9">Education of the Gifted <br>and Talented</b></center><p>


<b>Gifted and Talented Children <br>as Exceptional Children</b><p>

Special education for the gifted is not a question of advantage to the individual versus advantage to society.  It is a matter of advantage to both.  Society has an urgent and accelerated need to develop the abilities and talents of those who promise high







 contribution.  To ignore this obligation and this resource is not only shortsighted but does violence to the basic concept of full educational opportunity for all.<p>
Special educators should vigorously support programs for the gifted and talented as consistent with their concept of the need for special assistance for all children with exceptionalities.  Such programs should reflect both the cognitive and noncognitive 







needs of the gifted and talented. (Chapter 07, Para. 1)<p>


<b>Identification</b><p>

Gifted and talented children are those who are capable of high performance as identified by professionally qualified personnel.  These children require different educational programs and/or services beyond those normally provided by the regular school pro







gram in order to realize their full potential in contribution to self and society.<p>
Broad search and an early identification system for the identification of gifted and talented children within all sectors of the population should be the hallmark of an adequate educational system.  Identification procedures should also reflect individual







 means of identifying children with general intellectual ability, specific academic abilities, leadership abilities, and abilities in the fine and performing arts. (Chapter 07, Para. 2)<p>



<b>Delivery of Services</b><p>

No single administrative plan or educational provision is totally appropriate for the gifted and talented.  Certain administrative and instructional arrangements may provide settings in which the gifted and talented are likely to perform more adequately. 







 In the final analysis, however, the task is one of accommodation to the needs of the individual.<p>
New arrangements and new provisions must be utilized, including freedom to pursue interests which might not fit the prescribed curriculum, opportunities for open blocks of time, opportunities for consultation with persons and use of resources external to 







the classroom, and opportunities to bypass those portions of the curriculum that have been previously achieved by the individual.  These kinds of arrangements must present options across all educational settings and procedures within all programs for the 







gifted and talented, whether in the regular classroom or in highly specialized situations.<p>
Special education for the gifted and talented demands individualization within special programs in terms of student needs, as well as differentiation between programs for the gifted and talented and programs for other children and adults.<p>
A program of special education for the gifted and talented should provide continuing and appropriate educational experiences from preschool into adult years. (Chapter 07, Para. 3)<p>



<b>Preparation of School and Leadership Personnel</b><p>

Special preparation is required for those educators who have either specific or general responsibilities for educating the gifted and talented.  Teachers and other professional educators who work with the gifted and talented need special training in both 







program content and process skills.  Such training should be recognized by appropriate certification in the case of teachers and should receive the general support of local, state, provincial, federal, and private interests. (Chapter 07, Para. 4)<p>


<b>Demonstration Programs</b><p>

The preparation of school personnel in the education of the gifted and talented should be carried out in settings which permit opportunities to examine relevant research and to observe innovative administrative provisions and exemplary instruction.  This 







requires extensive library services, ongoing research or access to such research, and most importantly, centers in which teachers may observe and try out new styles of teaching appropriate to the education of the gifted and talented.<p>
Special model or demonstration programs should be established to illustrate to educators and others the kind and range of innovative program efforts that are possible and effective in the education of gifted and talented students. (Chapter 07, Para. 5)<p>










<b>Research and Development</b><p>

Research and development resources should be focused on the needs of the gifted and talented in order to develop new methodologies and curricula and to allow educators and others to evaluate current and proposed methods. (Chapter 07, Para. 6)<p>


<b>Parents and the Public</b><p>

One responsibility of the special educator is to educate the parents of gifted and talented children concerning their children's needs and rights.<p>
The educational needs of the gifted and talented also warrant planned programs of public information, particularly at the local community level.  Special educators should accept these responsibilities as an important part of their professional involvement







. (Chapter 07, Para. 7)<p>


<b>Financial Support</b><p>

Although programs for the gifted and talented can sometimes be initiated at relatively modest cost, it is important that funds for this purpose be earmarked at local, state or provincial, and national levels.<p>
Principal expenditures should be directed toward the employment of leadership personnel, the development of methods and programs, and of particular importance at the local level, the preparation of persons for the support and implementation of such method







s and programs in the schools.<p>
The importance of optimal educational services for the gifted and talented merits the expenditure of funds in appropriate amounts toward this end by all levels of government as well as by other sources. (Chapter 07, Para. 8)<p>

<center><b><a name="10">Managing Communicable Diseases<br> and<br> Students with Special Health Care Needs</b></center><p>


<b>Managing Communicable and <br>Contagious Diseases</b><p>

Controlling the spread of communicable and contagious diseases within the schools has always been a problem faced by educators, the medical profession, and the public.  Effective policies and procedures for managing such diseases in the schools have histo







rically been developed by health agencies and implemented by the schools.  These policies and procedures were primarily designed to manage acute, temporary conditions rather than chronic conditions that require continuous monitoring and remove children fr







om interaction with other children while the condition is contagious or communicable.<p>
Recent public awareness of chronic infectious diseases such as those with hepatitis B-virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and HIV have raised concerns necessitating the reassessment or at least clarification of school policies and procedures.  T







he Council believes that having a chronic infection does not in itself result in a need for special education.  Further, The Council believes that schools and public health agencies should assure that any such infectious and communicable disease policies 







and procedures:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	Do not exclude the affected child from the receipt of an appropriate education even when circumstances require the temporary removal of the child from contact with other children.
<li>	Provide that determination of a nontemporary alteration of a child's educational placement should be done on an individual basis, utilizing an interdisciplinary/interagency approach including the child's physician, public health personnel, the child'







s parents, and appropriate educational personnel.
<li>	Provide that decisions involving exceptional children's nontemporary alterations of educational placements or services constitute a change in the child's Individualized Education Program and should thus follow the procedures and protections required.








<li>	Recognize that children vary in the degree and manner in which they come into contact with other children and school staff.
<li>	Provide education staff with the necessary information, training, and hygienic resources to provide for a safe environment for students and educational staff.
<li>	Provide students with appropriate education about infectious diseases and hygienic measures to prevent the spread of such diseases.
<li>	Provide, where appropriate, infected children with education about the additional control measures that they can practice to prevent the transmission of the disease agent.
<li>	Enable educational personnel who are medically at high risk to work in environments that minimize such risk.
<li>	Provide educational personnel with adequate protections for such personnel and their families if they are exposed to such diseases through their employment.</ol><p>


The Council believes that special education personnel preparation programs should:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	Educate students about infectious diseases and appropriate methods for their management.
<li>	Counsel students about how to determine their level of medical risk in relation to certain diseases and the implications of such risk to career choice.</ol><p>

The Council believes that the manner in which policies for managing infectious diseases are developed and disseminated is important to their effective implementation.  Therefore the following must be considered integral to any such process:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	That they be developed through the collaborative efforts of health and education agencies at both the state, provincial and local levels, reflecting state, provincial and local educational, health, and legal requirements.
<li>	That provision is made for frequent review and revision to reflect the ever-increasing knowledge being produced through research, case reports, and experience.
<li>	That policies developed be based on reliable identified sources of information and scientific principles endorsed by the medical and educational professions.
<li>	That such policies be understandable to students, professionals, and the public.
<li>	That policy development and dissemination be a continual process and disassociated from pressures associated with precipitating events. (Chapter 03, Para. 19)</ol><p>



<b>Students with Special<br> Health Care Needs</b><p>

The Council for Exceptional Children believes that having a medical diagnosis that qualifies a student as one with a special health care need does not in itself result in a need for special education.  Students with specialized health care needs are those







 who require specialized technological health care procedures for life support and/or health support during the school day.  The Council believes the policies and procedures developed by schools and health care agencies that serve students with special he







alth care needs should:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	Not exclude a student from receipt of appropriate special education and related services.
<li>	Not exclude a student from receipt of appropriate educational services in the least restrictive environment.
<li>	Not require educational agencies to assume financial responsibility for noneducationally related medical services.
<li>	Define clearly the type, nature, and extent of appropriate related services to be provided and the nature of the appropriate provider.
<li>	Assure that placement and service decisions involve interdisciplinary teams of personnel knowledgeable about the student, the meaning of evaluation data, and placement options.
<li>	Promote a safe learning environment, including reasonable standards for a clean environment in which health risks can be minimized for all involved.
<li>	Provide assurance that health care services are delivered by appropriate and adequately trained personnel.
<li>	Provide appropriate medical and legal information about the special health care needs of students for all staff.
<li>	Provide appropriate support mechanisms for students, families, and personnel involved with students with special health care needs.
<li>	Provide appropriate and safe transportation.</ol><p>


The Council for Exceptional Children believes that special education personnel preparation and continuing education programs should provide knowledge and skills related to: (1) the nature and management of students with special health care needs; (2) exem







plary approaches and models for the delivery of services to students with special health care needs; and (3) the importance and necessity for establishing support systems for students, parents/families, and personnel.<p>
Recognizing that this population of students is unique and relatively small, The Council for Exceptional Children still believes that the manner in which policies are developed and disseminated related to students with special health care needs is critica







lly important to effective implementation.  In development of policy and procedure for this low-incidence population, the following must be considered integral to any such process:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>	That it be developed through collaborative efforts of health and education agencies at state, provincial, and local level.
<li>	That it reflects federal, state, provincial, and local educational, health, and legal requirements.
<li>	That it provides for frequent review and revision of intervention techniques and programs as a result of new knowledge identified through research, program evaluation and monitoring, and other review mechanisms.
<li>	That policies are supported by data obtained from medical and educational professions.
<li>	That policy development is easily understandable by students, professionals, and the public at large.
<li>	That policy development and dissemination should be a continual process and disassociated from pressures associated with precipitating events. (Chapter 03, Para. 23)</ol><p>

<center><b> <a name="11">Community-Based Services</b></center><p>

<b>Prerequisites</b><p>

Significant nationwide trends, both to reduce the populations of institutions and to improve the services provided for those who are institutionalized, necessitate comprehensive public policies on community-based services. Numerous exceptional children an







d adults reside in institutions.  The quantity and quality of education and other service programs provided in these facilities vary greatly.  Considerable evidence, however, has been collected demonstrating that many institutions for exceptional citizens







 have failed to meet the needs of their residents.  Institutionalization, in many instances, has violated basic individual rights and fostered inhumane deprivations.  Rights violated include the opportunity to live in a humane environment and be provided 







with individual programs of treatment designed to allow each person to develop to the greatest degree possible. <p>
    Despite public and professional awareness of deplorable institutional conditions, person with exceptionalities who could not live in natural homes were routinely placed in institutions.  Alternative service arrangements were usually not available and 







an implicit assumption was  made that some persons with disabilities were incapable of growth.  The lack of quality services and the stigma of negative attitudes must be changed.  <p>
    The Council, recognizing the necessity for community-based services, maintains that the human services system must adhere to the principle of normalization to avoid destructive individual and societal consequences and adhere to the following prerequis







ites:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Central to a person's growth and dignity is a right to live within the community, with access to high quality and appropriate services.
<li>A legal mandate with fixed responsibility must exist providing community services for all persons, including those now institutionalized.
<li>the goal of community services is to assure the greatest developmental gains on the part of the in individual through maximum flexibility in all services.
<li>The ongoing process of normalizing the service system requires developing a continuum, of community-based living environments and the selective use of the full range of services available to the entire community.  
<li>Multiple and diverse methods of safeguarding program quality are essential at every level of responsibility.
<li>All programs provided to exceptional persons must include written standards governing service delivery.
<li>When a state restricts an individual's fundamental liberty, it must adhere to the principle of least restrictive environment and, further, absolutely guarantee due process. (Chapter 06, Para. 1)</ol><p>

<b>Characteristics</b><p>
A comprehensive community-based service system for exceptional persons should reflect the following characteristics:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Services must meet the needs of persons of all ages, must accommodate the problems of individuals possessing all degrees of disabilities, and be available when needed and where needed by the individual.
<li>Services must be appropriately located in populous neighborhoods and should be compatible with the surrounding community.
<li>Services must be based upon a systematic plan for continuity that interrelates with other established services.
<li>Services must have a legally vested authority that enables the fixing of responsibility and accountability with implementation power.
<li>Services must be designed to permit the placement of exceptional persons in high quality programs in the least restrictive environment.
<li>Services must be economically sound in meeting human development needs.  (Chapter 06, Para. 2)</ol><p>

<b>The Need for Flexibility<br> and Development</b><p>
Because of rapid changes and developments  in the environmental factors that influence the characteristics of children and the conditions of their lives, special education should maintain a flexibility that permits it to adapt to changing requirements.<p>








    Some of the events and changes that have had major impact on special education in recent years are the following: a rubella epidemic, discovery of preventatives for retrolental fibroplasia, increasing  numbers of premature births, increasing awareness







 of the deleterious effects of poverty and malnutrition, new techniques in surgical intervention, invention of individual electronic hearing aids, and adaptation of low-vision aids.  Changes and developments in public health, medicine, technology, and soc







ial programs may have only a small total effect on school systems, but they frequently have major impacts on special education are quickly reflected in other aspects of the field as, for example, the rapid development of day school programs for children w







ith exceptionalities which has been reflected in a more severely disabled population in residential schools.<p>
    Special educators must seek to be highly flexible in the provision of services and the use of technology and techniques to meet the changing needs of children with exceptionalities.
    School administrators and special educators have particular responsibility for sustaining their professional awareness and development as a basis for changing programs to meet changing needs. (Chapter 06, Para. 3)<p>

<b>Prevention of Disabling Conditions</b><p>
Increasing knowledge of the biological and social causes of many disabling conditions now makes some conditions preventable.  The Council believes that appropriate prenatal counseling and care and intervention services could prevent or reduce the severity







 of many disabling conditions.  Therefore, The Council believes that there should be substantial governmental attention and resources devoted to prevention and the amelioration of the impact of disabling conditions including:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Research and development.
<li>Public awareness.
<li>Prenatal services.
<li>Child-and family-centered early intervention services.
<li>Family and parenting education and support programs for teenagers and other high-risk populations.
<li>Reduction of social and environmental factors that cause disabling conditions.  (Chapter 06, Para. 4)</ol><p>

<center><b><a name="12">Testing</b></center><p>
<b>Group Intelligence Testing</b><p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Psychological tests of many kinds saturate our society and their use can result in the irreversible deprivation of opportunity to many children especially those already burdened by poverty and prejudice.
<li>Most group intelligence tests are multileveled and standardized on grade samples, thus necessitating the use of interpolated and extrapolated norms and scores.
<li>Most group intelligence tests, standardized on LEAs rather than on individual students, are not standardized on representitive populations.
<li>In spite of the use of nonrepresentative group standardization's procedures, the norms are expressed in individual scores.
<li>Most group intelligence tests, standardized on districts which volunteer, may have a bias in the standardization.
<li>Many of the more severely disabled and those expelled or suspended have no opportunity to influence the norms.
<li>Group intelligence tests are heavily weighted with language and will often yield spurious estimates of the intelligence of non-English speaking or language different children.
<li>A group intelligence test score, although spurious, may still be a good predictor of school performance for some children.
<li>School achievement predicts future school performances as well as group intelligence tests, thus leaving little justification for relying on group intelligence tests.
<li>One of the most frequent abuses of group intelligence tests is the use of such tests with populations for which they are inappropriate.</ol><p>
    The Council goes on record in full support of the recommendations of the "Classification Project" (Nicholas Hobbs, The Futures of Children, 1975, pp. 237-239)pertaining to group intelligence testing as follows:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>"...That there be established a National Bureau of Standards for Psychological Tests and Testing."
<li>That there be established "minimum guidelines with respect to the utilization of psychological tests for the classification of children."
<li>"That organizations that make extensive use of educational and psychological tests...should establish review boards to monitor their testing programs."</ol><p>
    Until these three recommendations are accomplished, The Council encourages a moratorium, on the use of group intelligence tests by individual school districts for the purpose of identifying children with exceptionalities. (Chapter 03. Para. 13)<p>


<b>Minimal Competency Testing</b><p>

While most students with exceptional needs have been assured of their right to public education along with their peers, they have not been similarly assured of the opportunity to complete their education, graduate and receive a diploma signifying their ac







hievement.  There exist considerable variations and inconsistencies within and among the states and provinces regarding graduation requirements for pupils with exceptional needs and the procedures for their receiving, or not receiving, a diploma.<p>
An emerging issue that compounds these variations and inconsistencies is the minimal competency testing movement, which uses established test results as standards for the granting of diplomas or for the determination of grade placement.  Unless educationa







l policies in this area are formulated in order to resolve these inconsistencies, eliminate potentially discriminatory practices, and assure that graduation and grade placement requirements are equitably applied to all students, many of the educational ga







ins made by pupils with exceptional needs could be threatened or delayed.<p>
The Council believes that educational policies governing minimal competency testing and graduation and/or grade placement requirements for pupils with exceptional needs should be developed at the state, provincial, and local levels.  These policies should







 incorporate the following principles:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Every pupil with exceptional needs should have available the opportunity to demonstrate minimal competency.
<li>Alternative methods of minimal competency testing and the demonstration of minimal competency should be available to pupils with exceptional needs to assure that the competency level is being tested rather than the exceptionality.
<li>The Individualized Education Program (IEP)should be the vehicle for individually addressing the method by which each pupil with exceptional needs may demonstrate minimal competency standards and/or any differential standards that may be used.
<li>The application of minimal competency testing programs to pupils with exceptional needs should provide for adequate phase-in periods and educational preparation time.
<li>A minimal competency testing program for students with exceptional needs should provide successive opportunities to demonstrate competency, as well as adequate and appropriate remedial programs to address areas in which competency is not sufficiently 







demonstrated.
<li>Only one type of diploma should be granted to all students, and it should be accompanied by grade transcripts and/or course-of-study description.
<li>The successful implementation of a minimal competency testing program, including its application to pupils with exceptional needs, requires the cooperative efforts of regular educators, special educators, and parents in its planning, application , and







 evaluation. (Chapter 03, Para 14)</ol><p>

<center><b><a name="13">Ethnic and Multicultural Groups</b></center><p>

<b>Preamble</b><p>
The Council believes that all policy statements previously adopted by CEC related to children with and without exceptionalities, as well as children with gifts and talents, are relevant and applicable to both minority and nonminority individuals.  In orde







r to highlight concerns of special interest to members of ethnic and multicultural groups, the following policy statements have been developed. (Chapter 08, Para. 1)<p>

<b>Ethnicity and Exceptionality</b><p>
The Council recognizes the special and unique needs of members of ethnic and multicultural groups and pledges its full support toward promoting all efforts which will help to bring them into full and equitable participation and membership in the total soc







iety. (Chapter 08, Para. 2)<p>

<b>Identification, Testing,<br> and Placement</b><p>
The Council supports the following statements related to the identification , testing, and placement of children from ethnic and multicultural groups who are also exceptional.<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Child-find procedures should identify children by ethnicity as well as type and severity of exceptionality or degree of giftedness.
<li>Program service reporting procedures should identify children by ethnicity as well as exceptionality or degree of giftedness.
<li>All testing and evaluation materials and methods used for the classification and placement of children from ethnic and multicultural groups should be selected and administered so as not to be racially or culturally discriminatory.
<li>Children with exceptionalities who are members of ethnic and multicultural groups should be tested in their dominant language by examiners who are fluent in that language and familiar with the cultural heritage of the children being tested.
<li>Communication of test results with parents of children from ethnic and multicultural groups should be done in the dominant language of those parents and conducted by persons involved in the testing or familiar with the particular exceptionality, fluen







t in that language, and familiar with the cultural heritage of those parents.</ol><p>
    All levels of government should establish procedures to ensure that testing and evaluation materials and methods used for the purpose of classification and placement of children are selected and administered so as not to be linguistically, racially, o







r culturally discriminatory. (Chapter 08, Para. 3)<p>

<b>Programming and<br> Curriculum Adaptation</b><p>
The Council supports the following statements related to programming and curriculum adaptation for children from ethnic and multicultural groups:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Long-term placement should be avoided unless students are reevaluated at prescribed intervals by individuals qualified in assessing such students with the most appropriate culture-free assessment instruments available.
<li>All school districts should take necessary steps to ensure that both students and their parents fully comprehend the implications of and the reasons for proposed programming decisions, including the nature and length of placement.  Parents should be f







ully involved in the decision making process.
<li>Culturally appropriate individualized education programs should be designed that include the child's present level of educational performance, annual goals, short-term objectives, and specific educational services to be provided.  
<li>It is of utmost importance to identify children's relative language proficiency so that language appropriate special education programs may be provided (e.g., bilingual special education and special education programs incorporating English-as-a-Second







-Language instruction).
<li>Children with exceptionalities who are members of ethnic and multicultural groups should have access to special cultural and language programs provided to nonexceptional group members, with the necessary program adaptations to make the program benefic







ial to the exceptional child or youth.
<li>Culturally appropriate educational materials should be readily available in ample quantity so that all students, including those from ethnic and multicultural groups, may benefit from their content.
<li>Curriculum should be adapted or developed to meet the unique needs of children  from all cultural groups.  Curriculum should include a multicultural perspective that recognize the value of diverse cultural traditions to society as well as the contribu







tions of all cultural groups of American and Canadian society.
<li>  It is critical for teachers to recognize individual language and cultural differences as assets rather than deficits.  Furthermore, those assets should be utilized to enhance education for all children, including those from ethnic and multicultural 







groups. (Chapter 08, Para 4)</ol><p>

<b>Technical Assistance and Training</b><p>
Special and unique concerns of Council members from ethnic and multicultural groups that are related to technical assistance, training, and services will receive the attention and support of the Special Assistant to the Executive Director for Ethnic and M







ulticultural Concerns. (Chapter 08, Para. 5)<p>

<b>Special Projects</b><p>
<ol type=a>
<li>The Council will continue its interests in projects that meet the needs and concerns of all its membership.  Furthermore, The Council will actively search for projects that include special concerns of members from ethnic and multicultural groups.
<li>Projects that include special and unique concerns of members from ethnic and multicultural groups to be considered for development and implementation will receive the combined attention and support of various Council staff and the Special Assistant to







 the Executive Director for Ethnic and Multicultural Concerns.
<li>All projects of The Council will include opportunities for perspective and participation by ethnic and multicultural groups in formulation, implementation, and evaluation phases. (Chapter 08, Para. 6)</ol><p>
<b>Cooperation with Organizations, Disciplines, and Individuals</b><p>
<ol type=a>
<li>The Council will support efforts to explore with other organizations mutual concerns and issues related to ethnic and multicultural children and their families.  In the process, The Council will take care not to intervene in the internal affairs of an







y of the other organizations.
<li>The Council will support efforts to work cooperatively with other organizations in activities and services related to children with exceptionalities from ethnic and multicultural groups and their families.  (Chapter 08, Para. 7 )</ol><p>

<b>Migrant Exceptional Students</b><p>
Exceptional students who are mobile due to their parents' migrant employment, experience reduced opportunities for an appropriate education and a reduced likelihood of completing their education.  Child-find and identification policies and practices, desi







gned for a stationary population, are inadequate for children who move frequently.  Incomplete, delayed, or inadequate transfer of records seriously impedes educational continuity.  Interstate/provincial differences in special education eligibility requir







ements, programs and resources, minimum competency testing, and graduation requirements result in repetition of processing formalities, gaps in instruction, delays in the resumption of services, an inability to accumulate  credits for graduation, and othe







r serious inequities.  In addition to the disruption of learning, mobility disrupts health care, training, teacher-student rapport, and personal relationships.<p>
    The Council believes that educational policies and practices should be developed at federal, state/provincial, and local levels to improve access to education for migrant children and youth with exceptionalities.  these policies should include:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>A national system for the maintenance and transferal of special education records for migrant students with exceptionalities.
<li>Intrastate/provincial and interstate/provincial cooperation in the transfer of records and of credits.
<li>Flexibility in high school credit accumulation for migrant students with exceptionalities.
<li>Joint planning, coordination, and shared responsibility among special education, migrant education, bilingual education, and related programs.
<li>Funding patterns that adjust for variations in enrollment.
<li>Flexible scheduling and other programming options that adjust for student mobility.
<li>Routine monitoring of activities undertaken to identify the migrant exceptional student and to ensure educational continuity.  
<li>Ongoing research efforts to promote, improve, support, and evaluate the education of migrant students with exceptionalities.
<li>Personnel training.
<li>Parent and family information programs to facilitate record transfer. (Chapter 02, Para. 11)</ol><p>

<center><b><a name="14">Career Education<br> and Transition</b></center><p>
<b>Responsibilities for Providing <br>Continuing Education Services <br>to Exceptional Youth</b><p>
The Council believes that education is a lifelong process and that, instead of age, competency and maximal development should be the terminating factor with regard to formal schooling.  It also believes that individuals with learning problems, particularl







y exceptional youth, frequently need education and periodic reeducation beyond the traditional school attendance ages to encourage their continuing development.  These options might include post secondary education, vocational education, job training, emp







loyment counseling, community living skills, and placement services in order to maximize their ability to contribute to society. (Chapter 02, Para. 10)<p>

<b>Career Education</b><p>
Career education is the totality of experience through which one learns to live a meaningful, satisfying work life.  Within the career education framework, work is conceptualized as conscious effort aimed at producing benefits for oneself and/or others.  







Career education provides the opportunity for children to learn, in the least restrictive environment possible, the academic, daily living, personal-social and occupational knowledge, and specific vocational skills necessary for attaining their highest le







vels of economic, personal, and social fulfillment.  The individual can obtain this fulfillment though work (both paid and unpaid) and in a variety of other social roles and personal lifestyles, including his or her pursuits as a student, citizen,  volunt







eer family member, and participant in meaningful leisure time activities.<p>
    Children with exceptionalities (i.e., those whose characteristics range from profoundly and severely disabled to those who are richly endowed with talents and/or intellectual giftedness) include individuals whose career potentials range from sheltered







 to competitive work and living arrangements.  Children with exceptionalities require career education experiences which will develop to the fullest extent possible their wide range of abilities, needs, and interests.<p>
    It is the position of The Council that individualized appropriate education for children with exceptionalities must include the opportunity for every student to attain his or her highest level of career potential through career education experiences. 







 Provision for these educational experiences must be reflected in an individualized education program for each exceptional child that must include the following:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Nondiscriminatory, ongoing assessment of career interests, needs, and potentials which assures recognition of the strengths of the individual which can lead to a meaningful, satisfying career in a work-oriented society.  Assessment materials and proce







dures must not be discriminatory on the basis of race, sex, national  origin, or exceptionality.
<li>Career awareness, exploration, preparation, and placement, experiences in the least restrictive school, living, and community environments that focus on the needs of the exceptional individual from early childhood through adulthood.
<li>Specification and utilization of community and other services related to the career development of exceptional individuals (e.g., rehabilitation, transportation, industrial and business, psychological).
<li>Involvement of parents or guardians and the exceptional student in career education planning.</ol><p>
    Career education must not be viewed separately from the total curriculum.  Rather, career education permeates the entire school program and even extends beyond it.  It should be an infusion throughout the curriculum by knowledgeable teachers who modif







y the curriculum to integrate career development goals with current subject matter, goals, and content,  It should prepare individuals for the several life roles that make up an individual's career.  These life roles may include an economic role, a commun







ity role, a home role, an avocational role, a religious or moral role, and an aesthetic role.  Thus, career education is concerned with the total person and his or her adjustment for community working and living.  (Chapter 03, Para. 20)<p>

<b>Special Education's Responsibilities <br>to Adults with Disabilities-Preamble</b><p>
The Council believes that most students can learn to become contributing citizens, family members, employees, learners, and active participants in meaningful vocational, recreational, and leisure pursuits.  We believe, therefore, that it is an important p







urpose of education to assist students in the attainment of such outcomes.  Further, we believe that education from early childhood through adult education should focus on assuring that students with exceptionalities attain such outcomes. (Chapter 09, Par







a. 1)<p>

<b>Collaborative Responsibilities</b><p>
In order to assist students with exceptionalities to become productive workers and independent adults, special education should work in collaboration with adult service agencies to influence the provision of needed services from such agencies.  Collaborat







ion should include:<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>Working with postsecondary vocational/technical institutions, adult education, rehabilitation, and independent living centers that assess, train, and places persons with exceptionalities in meaningful work situations.
<li>Interaction and collaboration to provide  relevant information to agencies and organizations that will assist them to conduct job site assessments, training follow-up, and continuing training or education for persons with exceptionalities. 
<li>Assisting appropriate special educators to become knowledgeable about their community's labor market needs and build close working relationships and partnerships with the business and industrial sector so that receptivity toward potential employees wi
