<B>Project Title:  Efficient Inductive Battery Charging<p>
Performing Organization: Virginia Power, Electronic Power Technology, Inc. (EPTI); GNB Technologies, Power Control Systems (PCS)</B><p>

<P>POINT OF CONTACT: Kevin Curtis <BR>
Telephone (804) 771 ­6358  </P>


<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 

<P>The first technical objective of this project is to develop a method of combining an existing and efficient
pulse charging algorithm with an existing highly efficient inductive charger for a largenet increase in
charging efficiency. Secondly, the project also proposes to evaluate the performance of this advanced
charging system in an electric vehicle To do so, we will evaluate the performance of the algorithm
relative to inductive charging, validate its compatibility with inductive chargers, and study its effects on
the battery pack in an electric vehicle. The pulse charging strategy is expected to enhance the
performance and cycle life of the pack. </P>

<P>EPTI suggests that the algorithm is more efficient whether overnight or fast charging and can lead to
improved battery pack cycle life and performance. DELCO Power Control Systems has a highly
efficient inductive charger (MagneChargeTM) and is interested in advancing the device's capability to
be compatible with pulse charging algorithms such as the EPTI charging strategy Such charge
strategies have not been integrated with inductive charging systems before. Virginia Power, as a utility
that is active in research for EV infrastructure, has a capability to perform in­vehicle testing of EV
battery packs provided by GNB, Gates, and possibly others. This project Will be coordinated with a
project seeking to evaluate the pulse charging algorithm itself.</P>

<P>The team will jointly develop and test the capability to combine two efficient technologies to
demonstrate that their combined efficiency is higher that other existing techniques. The payoff of a
successful development will ultimately be lower "fueling costs" for consumers through more efficient
battery charging and extended battery life. The continued advancement of a highly efficient battery
charging infrastructure is essential to the EV transportation industry; therefore, successful
development of this combination of products will have a pervasive impact on EV use in both civilian and
military applications. This technical team recognizes the potential commercialization benefits to both
the sales potential of each company as well as to EV consumers world wide.</P>

<P>Efficient rapid charging of batteries is essential to hybrid operation of military vehicles where space
limitations constrain energy storage and power demands are high. The technology developed in this
project can be configured for use as rapid, high power charging by auxiliary power units in such
military hybrid vehicles. Likewise, it can be useful for high power, rapid­charging off­board chargers as
well for other types of military vehicles Successful advancement of this technology will benefit future
dual­use applications. </P>

<P><B>Benefit:</B></P><P>A highly efficient battery charging system that is inherently safe, maximizes and improves the
overall efficiency of the charging process, and enhances battery pack life and performance. </P>
