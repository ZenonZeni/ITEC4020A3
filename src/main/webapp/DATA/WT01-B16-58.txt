<h2>2.3 Program Management</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Background</strong><br>
The Management Center provides program integration and management support to the Program
Director and the two business centers -- the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project and
the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project. The Office of Program Management
and Integration, the Office of Human Resources and Administration, and the Office of Quality
Assurance constitute the Management Center, which is responsible for program planning and
management, technical and regulatory integration, quality assurance, institutional activities,
resources and information management, and international waste management activities. This
section describes how the Program adjusted these efforts to support its revised program strategy.
<p>
The December 1994 Program Plan described a program management approach that emphasized
products and progress, better integration of activities, clearer lines of responsibility and authority,
and more timely participation of stakeholders in the Program decision-making process. With
many of these objectives achieved, the Program has further modified program management
activities consistent with its reduced Fiscal Year 1996 funding level and guidance from the
President and the Congress.
<p>
The funding level for program management activities was reduced by 43 percent from $90
million in Fiscal Year 1995 to $51 million in Fiscal Year 1996, representing 16 percent of the
total program budget. Nearly 60 percent of the Fiscal Year 1996 program management allocation
covers costs that are effectively fixed or externally assessed, such as Federal salaries and Federal
office rent.
<p>
Program management activities have been reprioritized to support efforts to complete a viability
assessment of the Yucca Mountain repository site in 1998 and to support the development and
implementation of interim storage strategies. Building upon the management improvements
realized during Fiscal Year 1995, the Program will continue to enhance integration throughout all
program elements, to address cross-cutting technical issues, and to strengthen the effectiveness of
the management tools for baselining and tracking accomplishments and costs. Administrative
activities, such as personnel and contract administration, will continue. The reduced funding will
require a significant reduction in the Program's interactions with external parties.
<p>
<h4>2.3.1     Program Planning and Management</h4>
<p>
<strong>Program Planning</strong><br>
The Management Center will assist the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project and the
Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project in developing the technical, managerial,
and institutional strategies needed to accomplish the new targets and milestones under the
Program's revised approach. The strategies and objectives of individual project-level activities
will be integrated to achieve a consistent articulation of overall program policy, and to ensure
that the Program's policy and strategies are consistent with Departmental policy. 
The Management Center will also support the Program Director in communicating program
policy to key audiences internal and external to the Department of Energy and in articulating the
rationale for strategy and plan changes to program stakeholders. Support will be provided for the
Program Director's interactions with the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget to
explain and justify the revised program approach during the appropriations process. Management
Center staff will also support interactions with the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board,
which independently evaluates the Program's technical and scientific activities.
<p>
<strong>Baseline Management</strong><br>
Program cost, schedule, and workscope baselines are used to measure contractor and participant
performance in order to ensure that the appropriate work is performed on schedule and within
budget. We will continue to refine the baseline management process that has been established to
ensure that the baselines are clearly defined and integrated, and that changes are appropriately
controlled. Program progress is regularly assessed in accordance with the milestones, baselines,
and work defined by the planning process.
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1995, program baselines were revised to represent the work effort necessary to
achieve the milestones in the 1994 program approach. Further revisions to the baselines in Fiscal
Year 1996 will reflect the redirection made necessary by the Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation and
guidance from the President and the Congress. The impact of baseline changes will be identified
and evaluated.
<p>
<strong>Integrated Management Planning</strong><br>
We are improving our contractor management systems through the establishment of a single,
integrated, and more efficient way of doing business for all program elements and participants.
This new approach will be documented in the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
Integrated Management Plan which will establish high-level management system policy and
requirements.
<p>
<h4>2.3.2     Technical Integration
</h4><p>
Technical integration ensures that the Program's technical elements and activities are integrated
into a system that is safe, efficient, reliable, and cost-effective. The Management Center will
support the Yucca Mountain viability assessment, the market-driven waste acceptance, storage,
and transportation approach, and non-site specific interim storage efforts by focusing on the
identification and timely coordinated resolution of cross-cutting technical issues. Such issues that
potentially impact multiple program elements must be identified and resolved on schedules
consistent with the business centers' needs for the information. 
<p>
<strong>Near-term policy development and integration issues</strong><br>

<em>Waste canister options.</em> As a result of Fiscal Year 1996 appropriations actions, the Program will
not pursue further development of a multi-purpose canister system for transporting and disposing
of spent fuel. We do, however, recognize the benefits to be derived from standardization of
equipment and the desirability of encouraging designs which are suitable for later transport or use
at a Federal facility. Therefore, the Program will evaluate the impacts on the Federal program of
alternative canister options that may be developed and utilized under a market-driven waste
acceptance and transportation strategy. The technical integration evaluations will focus on the
most effective approaches to integrate the near-term requirements for the timely availability of
storage and transportation systems utilizing current technology with the evolving waste package
designs that satisfy the requirements of the disposal system. 
<p>
<em>Disposal of other Department-owned radioactive materials.</em> The Program will continue to
evaluate the impact of accepting Department-owned spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste into the civilian radioactive waste management system. The Program is working with the
Department of Energy's Office of Environmental Management, the current custodians for these
materials, to ensure that the materials planned for disposal in a geologic repository meet the
statutory and regulatory requirements for geologic disposal. The Program will also continue to
interact with other Department of Energy programs in the evaluation of other waste materials,
such as weapons-useable fissile material that may be declared surplus to national defense needs,
for which decisions regarding ultimate disposition have not yet been made. 
<p>
<strong>Regulatory and Performance Requirements</strong><br>
The Program's regulatory and performance requirements have been identified and interpreted in
the various levels of Program and Project requirements documents. During Fiscal Year 1996, the
Management Center will incorporate requirements for Department-owned spent fuel into the
Program's requirements documents structure. The existing suite of program requirements
documents will be streamlined to eliminate redundancy and ensure that the Program can respond
to future changes in policy and direction in an efficient and effective manner.
Building on the regulatory and performance requirements, the Program has developed a technical
baseline that includes design packages, drawings, and analyses, and provides traceability to key
requirements. Using the technical baseline as a tool, reviews will be conducted to evaluate how
well the system design meets regulatory and performance requirements and to ensure that the
interfaces among Program elements are identified and controlled.
<p>
<h4>2.3.3     Regulatory Integration</h4>
<p>
The Management Center will focus on three principal areas of regulatory integration: plans and
strategies for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; continued consultations with
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the repository and non-site specific interim
storage concepts; and reexamination of and possible modifications to the regulatory structure that
guides the licensing of the repository. 
<p>
<strong>Compliance with Statutes and Regulations
</strong><br>
The Management Center will continue to assist the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project
in developing strategies and plans for compliance with environmental, safety, and health
requirements, and will help to ensure that Project activities are consistent with Departmental
policy and with environmental impact statements completed or being prepared by other
Department of Energy programs. Pending regulatory changes will be analyzed to assist the
Program in complying with new requirements. As part of the policy development process, the
Program will participate in interagency working groups and review and comment on draft
Department of Energy orders and directives. Finally, to maintain policy consistency within the
Department, the Program will continue to interact with and provide Project data to other
Departmental offices on environmental, safety, and health issues.
<p>
<strong>Consultations with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission</strong><br>

The Program will continue consultations with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to improve
mutual understanding of the critical technical issues surrounding the repository program and the
activities required to resolve them, and to ensure that the Commission remains informed of the
Program's technical work and evaluations.
<p>
To support the objectives of the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project, the
Management Center will continue technical discussions with Commission staff on non-site
specific issues associated with interim storage. These discussions are expected to increase if and
when the Program is authorized to develop an interim storage facility.
<p>
<strong>Updating the Regulatory Framework for a Repository at Yucca Mountain
</strong><br>
The Management Center will work with the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project to
identify areas where revisions to the regulatory framework for a geologic repository are needed to
reflect the progress made in site characterization and the policy change to characterize only one
site. The Management Center will help develop revisions to the Department's siting guidelines
(10 CFR Part 960) and support interactions with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
Environmental Protection Agency on revisions to the Program's regulatory framework.
<p>
<h4>2.3.4     Quality Assurance</h4>
<p>
The Program maintains a mandatory quality assurance program to identify and ensure
implementation of requirements that protect the health and safety of the public, workers, and the
environment. The quality assurance program must meet Nuclear Regulatory Commission
requirements. Extensive development and review of technical and implementing documentation,
as well as effective implementation of the requirements, will be necessary to ensure the
soundness of our data and engineering, and to support eventual licensing of our facilities by the
Commission. Through quality assurance audits, the quality assurance program will independently
verify that the various designs being developed and scientific activities performed incorporate the
necessary regulatory requirements.
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1996, quality assurance audits will be performed and surveillance conducted
regarding work on the viability assessment for the Yucca Mountain site and on the design and
construction of the Exploratory Studies Facility. A recently developed program-wide system will
be implemented for identifying and correcting conditions detrimental to quality and for
performing trend evaluation. The Program will also continue the OCRWM Concerns Program,
which provides a vehicle for employees to confidentially identify program concerns and to obtain
resolution.
<p>
<h4>2.3.5     Institutional Activities</h4>
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act establishes public participation as a key component in program
activities. The Program will continue its coordination with institutions, organizations,
government agencies, and individuals representing a variety of interests. Direct financial support
for cooperative agreements will continue at a significantly reduced level. To respond to reduced
funding levels, Fiscal Year 1996 funding for the Program's cooperative agreements were reduced
to one-third of Fiscal Year 1995 levels; and funding for educational programs was reduced by 34
percent. Participation in national meetings and conferences and the production of education and
information materials such as videos, photographs, and fact sheets will be reduced. Other public
information activities such as traveling exhibits and utility information center outreach will be
terminated. The OCRWM National Information Center will provide minimum essential public
information services and products. Its primary communications medium will be the OCRWM
Home Page. Users can access the system on the World Wide Web at "http://www.rw.doe.gov".
The<em> Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Bulletin</em> will be published semiannually
rather than quarterly.
<p>
The provision of financial assistance to stakeholders needing assistance to travel to program
meetings will be suspended pending future budget decisions. The Program will continue to
announce pending decisions in the <em>Federal Register</em>; release draft documents, as appropriate, for
external review and comment; review and respond to comments in a timely manner; and provide
public comment periods at all public meetings. 
<p>
<h4>2.3.6     Resources Management
</h4><p>
<strong>Federal Human Resources
</strong><br>
The Management Center is responsible for recruiting, training, developing, evaluating
performance, and providing appropriate recognition for the Program's Federal staff and for
establishing a work place environment that supports the Program's goals and objectives. The
Program has responded to the Secretary of Energy's goal of reducing the Department workforce
during the next five years. Total Program Federal staffing levels, at 228 full-time equivalent staff
at the end of Fiscal Year 1995, will fall to 217 by the end of Fiscal Year 1996.
<p>
To aid in increasing the capabilities of Federal staff, the Program is implementing a career
development program tailored to individual employee needs. During Fiscal Year 1996, the
Program will continue this initiative, and concentrate on the execution of total quality guidelines,
temporary assignments, mentorships, and other personnel development initiatives. In Fiscal Year
l996, as the Program's staffing is being reduced, a new assessment of the qualifications, skills,
and abilities required to accomplish mission objectives will be made, and a plan will be
developed for retraining employees in areas where the appropriate complement of technical,
programmatic, and administrative staff is lacking. The Program will also continue to reform its
employee performance evaluation and recognition program in Fiscal Year l996. <a href="./fig10.gif"><em>Figure 10</em> </a>on the
following page presents the Program's Federal organization.

<p>
<strong>Contractor Resources</strong><br>
In response to the Fiscal Year 1996 funding reductions, the Program has had to significantly
reduce its contractor workforce. The Program had already reduced the work scope of its support
services contractors under the Department of Energy's Strategic Alignment Initiative. Payments
to support services contractors will be reduced by about 30 percent from Fiscal Year 1995 to
Fiscal Year 1996. By the end of Fiscal Year 1996, the Program's management and operating
contractor will reduce its staffing by almost 50 percent from Fiscal Year 1995 levels. 
<p>
To improve efficiency, the Program has consolidated the contractor support provided by the
Department of Energy national laboratories under the direction of the Program's management
and operating contractor.
<p>
The Program is taking steps to establish a single technical and management support services
contractor to improve the integration of activities between headquarters operations in
Washington, D.C., and the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project in Las Vegas, Nevada.
The Program plans to award a single contract by early Fiscal Year 1997 to consolidate these
services.<a href="./fig11.gif"> <em>Figure 11</em></a> presents the Program's contractor organization.

<strong>Information Resources</strong><br>
The strategic application of information technology contributes to the accomplishment of the
Program's mission by providing integrated information systems, solutions, and services that
enhance the productivity of our human resources, drive business process improvement efforts,
reduce overall program costs, and support the Administration's "reinventing government"
initiative through such efforts as coordinating the Program's utilization of the Internet.
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1996, primary emphasis will be placed on program-wide information management
planning and integration, mission-critical support for business and management centers, and
essential productivity enhancements which, in light of current budgetary and resource constraints,
have assumed increased importance. The Program will:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Develop a program-wide information management multi-year plan which will outline
specific information management actions to support the revised program objectives.
<li> Initiate the development of a program-wide information architecture to ensure integration
and integrity of technical, regulatory, management, and financial data.
<li>  Make business process improvement a top information management priority, beginning
with the identification and elimination of duplicative and overlapping information systems.
<li> Develop an approach to meeting program-wide records processing requirements in
support of the Program's licensing schedule.
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Financial Resources</strong><br>

Activities associated with financial management of the Nuclear Waste Fund include management
of the Fund's investment portfolio and development and monthly implementation of appropriate
investment strategies. In the past year, the Nuclear Waste Fund has outperformed the
intermediate-term Treasury Bond Fund index. The Program's financial statements on the Fund
will continue to be audited annually by an independent certified public accounting firm.
<p>
The Program will conduct fee adequacy analyses to determine whether fees being paid by waste
generating sources are sufficient to fund the Program throughout its entire life cycle. The Fiscal
Year 1996 analysis will be based, in part, on the 1995 <em>Analysis of the Total System Life Cycle
Cost of the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program</em>. In Fiscal Year 1997, the 1995
total system life cycle cost estimate will be updated. 
<p>
<h4>2.3.7     International Waste Management Activities</h4>
<p>
The Program's international waste management activities involve cooperation with other
countries and international organizations to exchange information and develop consensus on
common issues. During Fiscal Year 1996, the Program will continue to participate in bilateral
agreements with Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, France, Japan, and Spain to support the exchange
of waste management information. The Program will continue limited interactions with the
International Atomic Energy Agency and Nuclear Energy Agency. Due to funding constraints,
the Program has terminated cooperative research agreements with Sweden, Switzerland, and
Canada to develop information and technology relevant to the characterization of a potential
geologic repository at Yucca Mountain. Financial support for international cooperative science
and technology programs is expected to be minimal in future years.
<p>
<h4>2.3.8     Program Management Milestones and Funding Requirements</h4>
<p>
Program management activities contribute to accomplishing the milestone objectives for the
Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project and the Waste Acceptance, Storage, and
Transportation Project (described in <em><a href="./ch21.htm">Sections</em> 2.1.5, </a>page 58, and <a href="./ch22.htm">2.2.3,</a> page 68, respectively).
Many milestones specific to program management are either annual requirements or activities
related to effective implementation of the Program. The 1996-1999 Program Management
milestones are listed below and the funding requirements are shown in <a href="./table6.jpg"<em>Table 6 </em></a>on the following
page. The Fiscal Year 1996 dollars reflect the Program's Congressional appropriation, the Fiscal
Year 1997 dollars reflect the Administration's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request, and the Fiscal
Year 1998-1999 dollars reflect out-year funding requirements for the revised program strategy.
