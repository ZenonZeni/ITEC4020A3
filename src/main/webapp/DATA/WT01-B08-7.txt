SECRETARIAT IN MONTEVIDEO </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial"><strong>FORTALEZA. (MP).- The
creation of a development bank for Mercosur countries, a policy
of open skies for small and medium cities of the area and the
location of the Secretariat in Montevideo, were some of the very
important decisions taken in the Fortaleza summit.</strong> A
special group of experts was given five months to elaborate a
report on how to set up a non bureaucratic financial institution,
which must help in structural development investments such as the
improvement of land and fluvial communications systems to
facilitate trade and cut costs. Aid for the new bank has been
promised by the World Bank, the Interamerican Development Bank
and the Japanese government. Deregulation of regional flights was
decided to promote direct links between medium and small cities
of the six countries which at present can only be reached by step
flying through the main international airports of the area in
never ending trips. Direct scheduling between regional airports
will not interfere the main bilateral agreements. Finally
Montevideo was confirmed as the permanent location for the
Mercosur Secretariat, which will have an initial budget of 1,2
million US dollars and will be headed until 1999 by Uruguayan
Ambassador Jorge Fernández Reyes. </font></p>
