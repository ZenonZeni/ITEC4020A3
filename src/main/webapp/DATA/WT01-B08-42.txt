<h3><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Mexico, After A Closer
&nbsp; Relation With Mercosur </font></h3>

<p><font face="Arial"><strong>&nbsp;BUENOS AIRES. (MP).-</strong>
Mexico wishes to have a closer bilateral economic relation with
Argentina and in the near future a possible &quot;<em>four plus
one</em>&quot; association agreement with Mercosur, leading to
block to block links with NAFTA (North American Free Trade
Association).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Ernesto Zedillo the Mexican President, made
these remarks during his three days visit to Argentina following his
participation in the Iberoamerican summit held in Santiago de
Chile.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;<em>We favour an approximation of
Mexico to Mercosur since this would help to open markets and
increase trade which is to the benefit of all countries involved</em>&quot;,
said Zedillo during the signing with Argentine President Carlos
Menem of a bilateral Investments Protection and Guaranty
Agreement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">President Menem said Argentina would commit
its support for a closer relation of Mexico with Mercosur and a possible
future association similar to that of Chile, who recently
incorporated to the South American block.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">But in spite of Menem's optimism, Uruguayan
President Julio María Sanguinetti said it would be &quot;<em>difficult</em>&quot;
to liberalise trade between Mexico and Mercosur.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&quot;<em>It's a difficult issue since
Mercosur already has a complex trade structure, Mexico has its
commitment with NAFTA (United States and Canada), and it will be
hard to make progress</em>&quot;, indicated Sanguinetti.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Chile's Mercosur incorporation which became
effective last October took well over two years of endless negotiations
and in spite of a gradual drop in tariffs, Chilean farmers have
already successfully appealed in Court against the import of
agricultural commodities, mainly beef.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Mexico has bilateral agreements with all
Mercosur countries and would like to turn them into an only 4
plus 1 agreement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Mexico which has invested almost a billion
US dollars in Argentina, (cement, steel, banking, textiles), is
trying since the &quot;<em>tequila</em>&quot; crisis two years
ago, to increase trade and diminish its dependency of the United
States which absorbs 75% of its exports.</font></p>
