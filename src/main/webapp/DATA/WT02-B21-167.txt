<H1> Default Home Page</H1>

This is a default user Home Page. This should be the first thing
that you change. If you want your default homepage to be called
something other than "home.html" let me know and I will change it.

<P>
<H2>
Remember: <I>Anything</I> that you place in this directory, even if there
is no link to it, is accesssible to the world via a WWW browser - so
don't put anything here that you wouldn't want to share with the entire
planet!
</H2>
<P>

have fun!
