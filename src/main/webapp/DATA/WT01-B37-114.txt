<h1>THE ROLE OF ETHANOL ABUSE IN THE ETIOLOGY OF HEROIN-RELATED
DEATHS </h1>

<p>p. 891 </p>

<p>&quot;Our data suggest that ethanol enhances the acute
toxicity of heroin, and that ethanol use indirectly influences
fatal overdose through its association with infrequent
(nonaddictive) heroin use and thus with reduced tolerance to the
acute toxic effects of heroin.&quot; </p>

<p>[Ruttenber, A. J. and Luke, J. L., &quot;Heroin-Related
Deaths: New Epidemiologic Insights,&quot; Science, Vol 226, Oct
5, 1984, pp 14-20] &quot;found that blood ethanol concentrations
in excess of 1000 mg/L raised by a factor of 22 the odds of a
heroin user experiencing a fatal overdose.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The concomitant use of heroin and ethanol is well
recognized and considered dangerous...&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The phenomenon of combining ethanol and opiate use and
the resultant toxic effects were noted as early as 1881 [Hubbard,
F. H., The Opium Habit and Alcoholism, Barnes, New York, 1881, pp
3-14].&quot; </p>

<p>Possibilities examined: </p>

<p>1. Ethanol and heroin act additively or synergistically on the
central nervous and respiratory systems, producing
cardiopulmonary arrest that is more often fatal than that
produced by heroin alone. </p>

<p>2. Ethanol interferes with the metabolism of heroin,
prolonging toxic effects. </p>

<p>3. Ethanol consumption is commonly associated with infrequent
(nonaddictive) use of heroin, [Greene, M. H., Luke, J. L., and
Dupont, R. L., &quot;Opiate 'Overdose' Deaths in the District of
Columbia,&quot; Medical Annals of the District of Columbia, Vol
43, #4, April 1974, pp 175- 181] which results in reduced
tolerance to acute toxicity of heroin. </p>

<p>Decedents with toxicological evidence of drugs other than
heroin/ethanol were excluded from the study. </p>

<p>p. 895 </p>

<p>&quot;We determined that HE [High Ethanol] decedents had
significantly lower blood morphine concentrations than LE [Low
Ethanol] decedents and identified a significant inverse
correlation between concentrations of ethanol and morphine in the
blood. These findings suggest that there is a dose-response
relationship between consumption of ethanol and the acute
toxicity of heroin. However, blood ethanol concentrations
explained only 11% of the variation in blood morphine
concentrations, indicating that additional factors are probably
involved in the etiology of fatal overdose by users of heroin and
ethanol.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;There is no evidence from our study that ethanol
interferes with the metabolism of heroin.&quot; (This is in
response to possibility 3.) </p>

<p>p. 897 </p>

<p>&quot;Our data suggest that decedents who consumed large
quantities of ethanol before death also had used heroin
infrequently in the days before death.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Data presented here and in other studies [Ruttenber, A.
J. and Luke, J. L., &quot;Heroin-Related Deaths: New
Epidemiologic Insights,&quot; Science, Vol 226, Oct 5, 1984, pp
14-20; and Kalter, H. D., Ruttenber, A. J., and Zack, M. M.,
&quot;Temporal clustering of Heroin Overdoses in Washington,
DC,&quot; Journal of Forensic Sciences, Vol. 34, No. 1, Jan.
1989, pp. 156- 163.] indicate that fatal heroin overdose can be
influenced by the toxic effects of other drugs and by other risk
factors and is not merely the consequence of injecting unusually
high doses of heroin. Our results suggest that simply
discouraging the practice of drinking and injecting heroin may
not be effective in preventing fatal overdose. Combining chronic
ethanol abuse with infrequent (nonaddictive) heroin use should
also be discouraged. Since fatal overdoses are commonly
associated with ethanol use, public health measures directed
towards those who use both drugs may help reduce the incidence of
these deaths.&quot; </p>
