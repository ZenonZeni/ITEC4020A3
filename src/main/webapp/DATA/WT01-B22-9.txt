<h1><a name="OLE_LINK1">STATEMENT OF DR. A. H. BLATT, </a></h1>

<p><b>HOWARD UNIVERSITY.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DR. BLATT: That will not take very long, because as Mr.
Wollner has said, we are only dealing with two thirds of ten
percent of the material. Very briefly, the story is, you can take
Cannabis and extract it with one of several solvents, or
combinations of solvents and obtain a physiologically active
extract. The only successful technique that has been applied to
that so far has been a distillation process, and through the
distillation you can get out of it three substances, which I will
simply name and pass on. <br>
One of them is a paraffin hydrocarbon known as nonacosane, that
is, physiologically, inactive. <br>
If you do a distillation, you get a definite distillate, and all
chemists who have worked with Cannabis know it as red oil.
Unfortunately, it also was known as Cannabinol, and that has been
the cause of much trouble. <br>
This red oil looks a good bit like a lubricating oil of a rather
poor quality, a semi-solid material at room temperature. That
material we will simply call narcotic-active by a physiological
test. The real nasty principle about the situation is that that
material behaves as if it were a chemical substance, and there
have been three different formulas proposed for it. <br>
One of the formulas has Cot so far as two individuals having
agreed upon it. Then the hitch comes. In about forty years, three
English workers succeeded in preparing and isolating one <br>
pure chemical substance from this red oil. <br>
They called that Cannabinol, and the one individual substance
derived from it is also called Cannabinol. For thirty years,
nobody following them was ever able to get this pure Cannabinol.<br>
So, we went ahead and worked with Cannabinol, and assumed that we
were working with the pure substance. Then, roughly about eight
years ago, the pure chemical individual, pure <br>
Cannabinol, again was secured for the second time, and apparently
it can be repeated.<br>
Pure Cannabinol is the fourth chemical substance to be gotten out
of Cannabis, and it is the fourth one to be lacking in narcotic
activity. It is toxic, however, and it is quite possible that
some of the activity of Cannabinol, some of this complex activity
that has been referred to during the morning, is due to pure
Cannabinol as a chemical individual.<br>
The chemical structure of pure Cannabinol has been fairly well
worked out. It is not definitely settled. We do not need to go
into that There is one more thing that should be pointed out, and
that is the fact that for thirty years perfectly competent
chemists have taken this red oil, distilled, and worked with it
as if a pure chemical. It not only gives analytical values of
resin, but they are <br>
even more complex. You can carry out the chemical reactions with
this. So, let us refer to red oil as the crude Cannabinol; and
the chemical individual as pure Cannabinol. You can run chemical
reactions. You can reduce an acetylate and the products you get
out are still analyzable for the proper derivatives of crude
Cannabinol. That is, where everybody has gone <br>
haywire.<br>
There is one ray of hope, and a pretty definite one, as to the
confusion of a mixture which was taken to be a definite chemical
substance, and that is why progress has been so slow, and that is
the fact that we have no way quantitatively of following the
definite reaction of the chemical principle.<br>
The one ray of hope I mention is the fact that you can take red
oil, crude Cannabinol, remove one-fourth, which is inactive as
pure Cannabinol, and the residual three-fourths still retains
chemical activity. There is where the work begins. That is as far
as has been gotten chemically. <br>
There is just one more point here. As far as I have been able to
find, and I received corroboration at noon, there not only is no
correlation, or no correlation has been made, so far as I can
find. out, between the various color reactions for Cannabis and
the narcotic activity, and I was told at noon that, not only had
there been none made, but it was because there definitely is
none. So we can not fail to follow the activity as to this color
test.<br>
I may be getting off in deep water, but that is the apparent
final analysis. There is one more thing, and that will finish it
up. <br>
I hope not many people will be misled by the principle that the
active principle of Cannabis is Cannabinol. You will find it even
there. The active fraction which you will find, which is more or
less of a mixture, is called Cannabinol.<br>
You can find a chemical substance which is not active. I think
that covers it.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I think that adds oils to the fire. <br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Is there an active substance there? <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I will take your word for it, and Bromberg's on the
basis of his research in New York It leads us pretty much to
where we started. I think if all the research work done so far
were dumped together by a group of chemists, or if they started
out today on this investigation, that they would be exactly the
same as they are now inside of six months; that is, all of the
information which we have, which is very little, could be
accumulated in six months. <br>
Recognizing that situation, the Treasury two years ago undertook
to lay the basis for a competent attack on the problem. We did
not know what that would consist of, but we knew sound,
fundamental, reproducible information and data had to be
obtained. <br>
The first thing we did was to contact the Department of
Agriculture, and with their cooperation, there was planted a plot
at Arlington Farms over here, last summer, and the summer before,
where the plant was observed in its various stages of growth, and
which furnished us all of the <br>
criteria the literature offered us in the past. As I mentioned
earlier, about ninety percent of all of it was thrown out. The
report of the first year's investigation was published in the
journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association. I have a
number of copies here, if there are any technical men who have
not soon that report. <br>
An equivalent report is being prepared at the present time on the
basis of this summer's work.<br>
We have obtained several tons of Marihuana. We have extracted or
are extracting huge quantities of that material, in an effort to
provide a satisfactory amount on the basis of which a <br>
broad attack on the problem may be predicated.<br>
Dr. Matchett is in charge of the Treasury's own immediate attack
on the problem, and I believe he has some information which he
can lay before you this afternoon. Is that correct, Dr. Matchett?
