<P>August 2, 1996</P>
<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  &#167;   New economy minister Roque Fernandez is expected
to set a more orthodox tone for policy  making than his controversial
predecessor Domingo Cavallo. Deficit reduction is paramount, with more tough
spending cuts, possible new taxes and other fiscal reforms expected. It remains
to be seen what kind of political reaction this program sets off.  &#167; Ph.D.s
from Chicago dominate in the new economic lineup.  Page 2</P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   The government's defensive automotive policy is
under heavy fire from domestic and foreign groups  that feel it unfairly stacks
the cards against their interests. Some adjustments are likely, although the
government would like to keep them small so as not to stir the ire of car makers
that have made huge new production commitments.  &#167;  Politics have a heavy
hand in new favors to micro businesses and pulp and paper makers.  &#167;  The
telecommunications opening has been signed into law.  Page 3</P>
<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   With the threat of US economic sanctions still
looming large, President Samper has produced a  legislative package to crack
down on drug traffic. In toto, it is an unconvincing effort and unlikely to pass
congress in time to head off sanctions.  &#167;  The new approved 1997 budget
aims to cut the deficit sharply.  Page 4</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B>  &#167;   The new political reform agreement puts in place a
major building block for stability. President  Zedillo, who guided its many
compromises, will feel one of its first effects, becoming the first president to
govern without an absolute majority.  &#167;  The hugely successful $6 billion
floating rate bond issue will retire a big chunk of more costly debt to the US
Treasury and to the IMF.  Page 5</P>
<P><B>PERU</B>  &#167;   Successful renegotiation of its Paris Club and Brady
debts brings Peru back into the international financial fold on favorable terms.
But it also means meeting a real-world debt service schedule that will require
much higher export earnings.  &#167;  The president's independence day message
contained several pro-business measures including a program to boost exports and
micro-enterprises.  Page 6</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA</B>  &#167;   More far-reaching structural reform is underway
now that the first round of stabilization  measures have taken hold. The new
sales tax is in effect and the government is seeking to restructure its costly
domestic debt and may buy back some Brady debt. Investor interest is also
perking up at the prospect of deregulation of the petroleum derivatives market.
&#167;  Accusations that the Venezuelan army is selling weapons to Colombian 
guerrillas are the latest strain on the two countries' relations.  Page 7</P>
<P><B>INSURANCE INDUSTRY REPORT  </B> &#167;   Mexico's insurance industry is
slowly on the mend after slipping  badly in last year's recession. The recovery
of the economy, the privatization of social security and the opening of the
industry to foreign participation through the NAFTA connection are expected to
provide impetus for strong growth in the coming years. Several international
companies have recently entered the market.  Page 8</P>
<P><B>FINANCIAL REPORT/LATIN AMERICAN M&amp;A</B>  &#167;   Merger and
acquisitions fever is going strong in  Latin America, as governments continue to
privatize and local firms seek consolidation and new capital, technology and
management to see them over the hump of economic modernization and
globalization. Thanks to its large population of private companies, Brazil is
the site of particularly hot activity and will become even a greater attraction
once its privatization program builds momentum. But Argentina also offers a high
level of M&amp;A activity, thanks to provincial privatizations and its hookup
with Brazil in Mercosur. Throughout the region, the financial sector is ripe for
an M&amp;A wave.  Pages 9-10</P>

<H3>Cavallo's Replacement Brings Same Broom To the Economy</H3>
<P>The sudden demise of economy super-minister Domingo Cavallo immediately
raises the question of &quot;what next for the economy?&quot; The answer quickly
shot back by his replacement, former central bank head Roque Fernandez, is &quot;more
of the same.&quot; The market believed the message and reacted with surprising
mildness to the graceful departure of the man who created the convertibility
plan, tamed inflation and pushed free market reform. Now it remains to be seen
whether the message holds and whether Cavallo's ouster by his frequent sparring
partner President Carlos Menem really amounts to no more than a ripple on a
pond. </P>
<P>An early reading of what lies ahead is that legislation may more smoothly
pass a congress that had become belligerently hostile to Cavallo. With
Fernandez, a Chicago School zealot, unpopular austerity measures will not
disappear. Nor can they, as Argentina's growing deficit leaves little room for
maneuver in the economic arena. But for the longer term there is no question the
new minister faces a tough political situation.</P>
<P><B>Menem On The Line.</B> By dismissing Cavallo at such a difficult
juncture for the sluggish economy, the president has put himself in a tricky
position. Menem made the change, so at least in the short-term he owns the
results. Fernandez's prescription for deficit reduction is not likely to be
politically popular. Yet, it would be disastrous for Menem to try to block
controversial changes, thus risking the resignation of his new appointee.</P>
<P><B>No Mr. Nice Guy</B>. Fernandez says he aims to balance the budget and
reduce government debt. His first priorities will be to settle on a fiscal
reform package with the cooperation of the IMF's Vito Tanzi, and push for labor
reform, assisted by labor expert Carla Pacini. Fernandez is considered much more
anti-deficit than Cavallo was and is expected to try harder to press ahead the
state reform, thus cutting expenditures. As an orthodox economist he is also
disinclined to case-by- case solutions and special arrangements (as, for
example, the one that protects the auto industry).</P>
<P><B>Head On With Labor.</B> Union leaders are not at all happy with the new
economic leader. Fernandez has confirmed the unpopular benefit cuts recently
announced by his predecessor (LL 7/19/96) and is already talking about
additional austerity measures. Fernandez also intends to move further towards
the elimination of the inefficient social services, currently under union
control. It is rumored that part of the labor reform will eliminate dismissal
compensation. Instead, a fund endowed with employers' contributions would take
care of whatever compensation is paid.  This approach, which has already been
introduced to cover workplace accidents, should give companies greater
flexibility and remove one of the deterrents to new hiring. </P></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="300">
<P><B>Fuel Tax?</B> Fernandez would also like to tax heating oil and diesel
fuel, which is used by an increasing number of cars. At a price one third that
of gasoline, diesel fuel is indeed a tempting target. Congress can be expected
to resist this change, or a change in the rules on how fuel tax revenues are
distributed: 29% for the federal government, 29% for provinces, and the balance
for a housing scheme. Menem has also said there will be no new taxes, but his
pronouncements on the economy have to be weighed against his need for Fernandez
to succeed.</P>
<P><B>It Had Been Coming.</B> Cavallo's ouster does clear the air. His battles
with Menem were legendary, as were his frequent, theatrical accusations of
corruption in high places. He had many enemies in influential circles and
diminishing popular support. With unemployment stuck at around 17%, the most
recent round of austerity measures aimed at cutting the deficit sent his
approval rating to less than 20%. (Menem's is barely better.) </P>
<P>For all his skill and international stature, Cavallo was becoming more of a
liability than an asset. It was finally over a minor disagreement &#150; on the
reimposition of a tax on interest rates for the benefit of the bank employees'
health organization &#150; that Menem asked for Cavallo's resignation. The
president immediately offered the post to economists Roberto Aleman and Miguel
Broda, but both rejected the advance. Finally Menem appointed Fernandez.</P>
<H3>WHO'S WHO ON THE ECONOMIC TEAM</H3>
<P>Roque Fernandez holds a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, is one of the
authors of the convertibility plan and a founder of the Centro de Estudios
Macroeconomicos (CEMA). Pedro Pou, another Chicago Ph.D., succeeds Fernandez at
the helm of the central bank. Fernandez has moved energetically to put in his
own people, drawing heavily from like- minded members of the central bank board.
Pablo Guidotti, who used to work for the IMF and is also a Chicago Ph.D., will
be minister of finance. Eugenio Pendios is leaving the bank superintendency to
be secretary of economic planning. Carlos Rodriguez, chairman of CEMA and also a
Chicago monetarist, will be the chief of Fernandez's three counselors. The other
two are Guillermo Calvo, noted for having forecast the Mexican crisis, and Carla
Pacini, another Chicago alumna and labor market expert. Industry, commerce and
mining will be headed by Alieno Guadagni, former ambassador to Brasilia.
Guadagni is labeled a Keynesian, so far the only high level break with the
Chicago school. A few members of Cavallo's team will remain, such as the
secretary of agriculture and the head of the DEI (Argentina's IRS).</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
