FBI Director on industrial espionage <p>

From: kadie@cs.uiuc.edu (Carl M Kadie) <p>

Quotes of FBI Director Louis Freeh from a Clarinet/Reuters story. He
was speaking to the Executives' Club of Chicago on Thursday. <p>

"The threat is real." <p>

"A nation's power is increasingly measured by economic
prosperity at home and competitiveness abroad. And in some ways, the
United States is a sitting duck for countries and individuals who want
to take a short cut to power." <p>

"We had $1.5 trillion invested in research and development during the
1980's alone. We also have an open society and a devotion to free
market principles that can make it relatively easy to steal secrets
and technology." <p>

[At least 20 nations are] "actively engaged in economic espionage." <p>

"This kind of information [cost and price structure, research and
development results, marketing plans, bids and customer lists] can be
intercepted from fax and satellite communications. It can be monitored
from cellular and microwave telephone links. It can be retrieved from
inadequately protected computer systems." <p>

"Advanced telecommunications technology will make it impossible for
the FBI to carry out court-approved surveillance in life-and-death
cases." <p>

"The country will be unable to protect itself against terrorism,
violent crime, foreign threats, drug trafficking, espionage,
kidnapping and other grave crimes." <p>

"Development of technology is moving so rapidly that several hundred
court-authorized surveillances already have been prevented by new
technological impediments with advanced communications equipment." <p>
