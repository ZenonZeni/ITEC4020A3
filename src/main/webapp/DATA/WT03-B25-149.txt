Special Processing of Large and Small Aerospace Parts
</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Large and small chromium-plated parts need special processing 
and inspection...</B>
</CENTER>
<P>Diamond Chrome Plating, Inc. in Howell, Michigan, does not use 
automated plating lines. The sizes and intricate shapes of the parts plated 
call<B> </B>for special handling, processing and inspection. 
<P>More than half of the work done is aerospace related, 
including<B> </B>aircraft landing gear components, hydraulic servo components, engine 
management parts, actuators, pins and frame parts. The other half is divided 
among commercial hydraulics, piston rods, cylinders, artillery, crankshaft 
bearings, dies and molds.
<P>According to Jack Beatty, general manager, the work done at 
Diamond Chrome Plating is labor intensive. 
Usually,<B> </B>selective plating is done on low-volume parts. All plating is manual, using no barrels. The company will 
not automate because parts require precision processing. Many of the parts 
have three different coatings on different 
areas,<B> </B>and some<B> </B>require as<B> </B>many as 
30 separate<B> </B>plating operations.
<P>Diamond Chrome Plating maintains more than 20 hard chromium 
plating tanks capable of handling parts in excess of 30 ft and depths to 10 ft. An array 
of rectifiers, some capable of delivering more than 10,000 amps, are available 
for larger parts. Items weighing up to four tons can 
be<B> </B>processed.
<P>Diamond Chrome is one of the two test sites in Michigan involved in 
a U.S. EPA Common Sense Initiative program run through the Industrial 
Technology Institute in Ann Arbor. The program is evaluating methods 
that existing platers can use to meet the new MACT standards without 
completely replacing ventilation systems. It appears that Diamond Chrome 
can meet the new standards by using fume suppressants in conjunction <BR>
with its existing equipment and some work practice modifications. Work 
is continuing.
<P>The plating company is proficient in three general 
processes: hard chrome, electroless nickel and vacuum cadmium. It generally plates electroless nickel on parts less than three feet long or one and a half feet in diameter. 


<P>The vacuum cadmium plating chamber handles pieces to 
approximately five ft long and two ft wide. Limits vary with part geometry. Vacuum 
cadmium is an engineering coating applied at thicknesses similar to 
electroplated cadmium (0.0002 to 0.0005 inch nominal). It is done in a 
vacuum chamber similar to those in traditional vacuum plating. Diamond 
Chrome also does low embrittlement electrolytic cadmium plating: 
LHE-cadmium and cadmium-titanium. 
<P>Other plating capabilities include precision dense chromium, 
sulfamate nickel and zinc nickel. Abrasive and glass bead blasting, polishing, 
welding, baking, passivating, cleaning and degreasing 
as<B> </B>required to prepare parts for plating are some of the company's support operations.
<P>&quot;There are two types of plating performed: precision 
plating to size for immediate use, and overplating (heavy plating) to 
be<B> </B>ground to finish. In both cases, it is necessary to know the plating thickness. Precision 
plated parts must meet tolerances called out by the customer. Overplated parts 
must have sufficient chromium to clean-up in grinding without causing lost 
grinding time due to excessive plating build-up,&quot; said Mr. Beatty. Hand-held 
CGX coating thickness measurement gages solved the company's problem. 
<P>Eleven gages are assigned to working leaders in the chromium and 
cadmium plating departments, as well as the Final 
Inspection department. Gages also have<B> </B>right angle 
probes<B> </B>for measuring in holes. This has saved 
labor costs, since poor quality products are not shipped to customers who end 
up returning them for rework.
<P>Diamond Chrome<B> </B>Plating started<B> </B>operation in January 1954 in a 
small 7,500-sq-ft building in the center of Howell, Michigan, east of Lansing 
and west of Detroit. The company started with three employees, one plating 
tank and a station wagon.
<P>Five expansions over the years have resulted in its present 
35,000-sq-ft operation that fills a city block and houses offices, laboratory, tool 
room, storage and processing areas. Approximately 80 employees staff a 24-hr 
a day operation. Its trucks provide pickup and delivery along the I-94 
expressway corridor.
<P>The company's plating processes are approved by 
most<B> </B>aircraft manufacturers. Many of the company's customers supply components to Allied 
Signal, Boeing, General Dynamics, General Electric, BF Goodrich Landing 
Gear Division, Hamilton Standard, Menasco, McDonnell Douglas, 
Messier-Dowty, Pratt and Whitney, and Sikorsky. With end users like these, precision plating is paramount.     <B>PF</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
