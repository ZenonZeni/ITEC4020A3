The Changing Face Of The American Worker


THE U.S.  LABOR FORCE TODAY IS A PAStiche of workers of all ages, ethnicities,
genders and skill levels.  The mix is a far cry from 1960 when, according to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 90% of the permanent job pool consisted of
skilled and semi-skilled white men.  Today, there may not be a job for
everybody, but many more kinds of people are available to work.

In the next 10 years, not only will the labor market retain its kaleidoscopic
quality, the ranks of older workers, minorities and women will expand a good
deal further.  BLS projects that in 2005, 62% of all workers will be women and
minorities, compared with 58% in 1992.  One out of every three people over the
age of 55 will be in the work force; 39% of the labor pool will be 45 or
older, up from a current level of 31%.

As a result, experts foresee rising numbers of part-time skilled employees
working later in life than did the previous generation.  As workplace
diversity becomes even more obvious, issues concerning the glass ceiling for
women and minorities and adjusting management to different work styles will
have to be addressed with more effective diversity programs.  Moreover,
training, compensation and benefits programs will have to change to take into
account the needs of this multicultural labor force.

Retraining existing workers to fill projected needs will become one way to
retain valued employees in an age when neither employee nor employer can
expect lifelong loyalty.  Compensation programs based on productivity and
including investment options are likely to become even more common than they
are today.  Benefits that make life easier for two-income families and single
parents will give companies an edge in the competition for the best job
candidates.

Of course, today's employers already have begun making some adjustments for
women and minorities, but few have thought about what it will mean to
accommodate large numbers of aging members of the Baby Boom generation.  They
will soon find themselves doing so.  As Philip Rones, a Bureau of Labor
Statistics expert on aging workers, puts it, "Throughout their working lives,
the Baby Boomers have dominated the work force demographics.  This is not
going to change as this group ages."

One reason many older Baby Boomers will still be working in 2005 and beyond:
they won't have the enticements to end their careers as early as many of their
parents.  Several recent initiatives, if passed, would further reduce the
feasibility of early retirement.  A proposal before Congress would raise the
minimum eligibility age for Social Security payments.  Smaller company
contributions to pension plans will discourage early retirement.  In short,
not only will aging Baby Boomers comprise a large percentage of people
available to work in 2005-many will have to stay on the job longer.

Age Plus Skills Equals Jobs

The predicted abundance of older workers should prove very good news to many
companies.  By the time 2005 rolls around, middle-aged and elderly employees
will possess two of the characteristics most prized by bosses:  they'll be
experienced and they'll be cheap.  Many companies will be eager to keep them
in the work force.

This will be a significant change from today's labor atmosphere.  After all,
company after company has spent the past decade kicking aging workers off
payrolls to cut costs.  Not only do older workers, by dint of seniority, tend
to have the highest salaries, they also may have more health problems, a
factor that drives up company medical plan costs.

However, Dallas Salisbury, president of the Employee Benefit Research
Institute, says several changes in compensation and related areas-already
underway at some companies-should level the playing field for older workers
soon.  By 2005 this set of workers will be no more or less desirable than
younger employees, because soon there will be little cost difference in
employing various age groups, he says.

"What I find really interesting is that there are things taking place for
reasons that have nothing to do with older workers," Salisbury observes.  "Yet
these changes will make it more desirable to employ this group in the future.
We seem to be entering a new era of age neutrality in the workplace."

These initiatives include the movement toward pegging salaries to an
individual's performance or that of his work division.  "Many companies fear
that older workers slow down somewhat and don't produce as much," he says.
"However, when salary is tied to performance, those who don't work as hard
don't cost as much.  In addition, you create an incentive for people to
continue producing top-quality work, year after year, no matter what their
age."

"The movement toward defined contribution pension plans also makes it much
easier to employ older people," Salisbury adds.  "In the past, most companies
offered straight pensions, which meant that they had to pay more into plans as
workers got older, no matter what.  Now, the employee has to pick up some of
the costs himself.  And, what the company pays is tied to how much the worker
earns, not his age."

A third trend-offering salary packages that mix cash, stocks and bonds-often
appeals to older workers because they need to pile up investments, Salisbury
says.  Although these weren't designed with older workers in mind, such
benefits work in their favor.

There's another factor likely to increase the desirability of older workers
over the next 10 years.  The Baby Boom boasted more college graduates than any
other generation in American history, according to Education Department
statistics.  "The future belongs very much to workers with strong skill sets,"
says Alan Reynolds, a scholar at the Indianapolis-based Hudson Institute.
"The demand for them already is outstripping the supply.  Today there are over
100 million people in the labor force, and only about 20% of them have college
degrees."

BLS predictions about employment growth by industry between now and 2005
follow a pattern of more jobs in services and fewer in manufacturing, the
model that has dominated the U.S.  economy since the 1970s.  Although some
service jobs require little education, nearly all high-paying ones call for at
least a college degree.  And few require the physical strength and dexterity
usually associated with younger workers.

Barbara Adolf, a benefits expert in the Fort Lee, New Jersey, office of
consulting firm Kwasha Lipton, predicts that aging workers will be well
positioned in 2005-providing they are well-educated.  "In the next century,
there'll be more competition for skilled workers-particularly in high-tech and
service jobs," she says.  "Companies already are much leaner.  They're saying
in effect.  'There's no room for fat anywhere.  Each job has to count and
contribute to the company's goals.' All this creates a tremendous pressure on
organizations and individuals to perform.  Suddenly, human resources
departments have become very important to companies."

"The good news for workers, though, is that if they have the right skill sets,
they will be sought after," she says.  "Many very talented people actually now
find themselves in stronger positions than they were when companies were
fatter.  In the next century, this should mean that highly skilled older
workers will find themselves both more in demand and with fewer young people
as competition."

Of course, in between the lines, Adolf implies that 2005 will be a very harsh
time for aging employees-as well as the younger ones-who lack the requisite
background.

Steve Bookbinder, a vice president in the Boston office of management
consultant Towers Perrin, says the skilled older workers of 2005 should have
little trouble attracting jobs-on the company's terms.  "Corporate America
would love to be able to hire many experienced workers," he says.  "They'll
probably try to hire them part-time, so they don't have to pay their medical
benefits or fund their pensions."

Martin Sicker agrees with Bookbinder's latter conclusion.  The economist heads
the older workers program for the Washington, D.C.-based American Association
of Retired Persons.  He says workers over age 55 often are forced out of
full-time employment and into a string of part-time jobs.  A recent BLS study
also documents a very strong increase in older men being forced into
retirement, then taking low-paying, part-time jobs with few benefits.

During the last 10 years, the trend of pushing aging workers out of permanent
jobs and into consultancies and other part-time arrangements has created
tremendous tensions between old and young workers, to say nothing of
management and labor.

However, there are some good reasons to think this hostility will subside.  As
EBRI's Dallas Salisbury points out, there is a strong trends toward
age-neutral wage and benefits policies, a phenomenon that should lessen some
of the stigma against aging workers.  In addition, with the largest block of
the population, the Baby Boomers, approaching late middle years, older workers
will become socially and politically more powerful.

Dealing with Diversity

Aging workers are not the only cohort that will be represented in greater
numbers in the work force in 2005.  The ranks of women and the minorities will
also be larger.

Many experts believe women are the growing demographic segment best adapted to
the economy of 2005, with its preponderance of service jobs.  "Traditionally,
women have been well-represented in service industries," says Ken Goldstein, a
labor economist with Manhattan's Conference Board.  "They have tended to
gravitate toward these jobs, and society generally has accepted them in these
positions.  In fact, one of the reasons larger numbers of women have been
entering the work force in recent years is the increase in services work.  If
our economy was still concentrated in heavy industry, there probably would not
be as many women workers."

The fate of minorities in the 2005 job pool will be strongly linked to
educational achievement and skills training.  "Historically, there have been
relatively large proportions of dropouts among minorities," says the Hudson
Institute's Alan Reynolds.  "To survive in the economy of the future, it's
very important that more minorities become college graduates.  Actually, this
already has started happening for blacks.  Education Department statistics
show that more blacks are entering college than ever before."

While it's likely that a good share of African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians
will possess the education needed to snare jobs in 2005, many companies will
have to alter their workplace culture in order to create an atmosphere in
which all types of workers can be productive.

Michael Wheeler, a Conference Board associate who recently completed a study
of corporate diversity initiatives, says that while progressive managements
currently tend to be aware of the need for an inclusive atmosphere, they
falter in their attempts to generate one.  "There's a gap between awareness
and understanding what to do.  And our study included only companies that
volunteered to establish diversity initiatives.  Right now, there's a lot of
talk, but not a lot of models."

A recent study by the Center for the New American Work force at Queens College
in New York City concluded that diversity strategies often fail because they
are not linked to positive business initiatives.  Instead, many companies
start such programs just to avoid lawsuits and unfavorable publicity.

However, Wheeler believes that diversity initiatives will increase, both in
number and importance, between now and 2005 because there are compelling
business reasons to create an inclusive culture.  "The first reason is
creativity," he says.  "When you have people coming together from a variety of
backgrounds to discuss business issues, you get more responses and more
options for solving problems."

"Our study showed that cross-cultural problem-solving groups often take longer
to get started than homogenous groups, because it takes more time for people
who differ to understand each other," he says.  "But the work was definitely
more creative and far-sighted than when people from like backgrounds got
together."  The second business advantage of a diverse team:  it reflects the
marketplace.  "More and more, the U.S.  is made up of all sorts of people from
all sorts of backgrounds," Wheeler says.  "And this is the prime customer base
that many companies want to sell to.  There's a lot to be said for having a
work force that looks like your customer base."

He adds, "In the past U.S.  companies operating in foreign markets often made
the mistake of bringing all their staff from home.  Often they wound up making
stupid mistakes that wouldn't have occurred if they'd had talked more to the
locals.  Companies are in danger of being in the same predicament at home-if
they don't try to include many types of people in their decision-making
processes."

"And that's the whole point about 2005," Wheeler says.  "Companies will find
ways to work with all these different kinds of employees-better ways than they
have now-so that they can appeal to many kinds of customers"

Redefining Benefits

Companies still need good employees, even though they are unwilling to finance
lifelong employment and defined-benefit pension plans.  This often translates
into a situation in which employers go out of their way to provide benefits
that don't cost the corporation much, but nonetheless simplify and improve
life for the workers.

For instance, Kwasha Lipton's Adolph says her own company has begun offering
such innovative benefits as on-site car washes and laundry pick-ups, as well
as payroll programs that make automatic de- ductions for consumer purchases
like car payments.  Such offerings are shrewd corporate moves, she points out,
because they win the workers' gratitude and generally cost very little.  Of
course, providing these services on-site also reduces workers' outside
chores-and keeps them at their desks longer.

Telecommunications company GTE Corp.  in Stamford, Connecticut, has developed
a number of programs tailored to women, who comprise about 60% of its
employees.  They include a back-up on-site daycare center, open on work days
when school is out, and a referral service for care providers for older
relatives.

"Many members of the Baby Boom generation will have critical childcare and
eldercare needs, often at the same time," Adolf says.  "More employers will
need to offer supports-beyond the traditional compensation and benefits-so
these workers, particularly the women, can do their jobs."

Another of the far-sighted new benefit offerings is continuing education.
These programs soothe the workers' fears of job loss by enabling them to
expand their skills and retain their desirability in the marketplace, Adolf
says.  At the same time, the programs do not involve a promise of continued
work from the employer.

Northern States Power, a Minneapolis utility, has developed an innovative
program that addresses both workers' fear of unemployability and management's
dread of an underprepared work force.  The company's offerings include
teaching computer skills to meter readers, a job category Northern States
plans to replace with machinery.  The utility also is a leader in providing
high-potential members of minority groups and with professional mentors.

Adolf adds that in some shrewdly managed companies, the death of the concept
of a job-for-life has freed both management and workers to negotiate each
job's hours, structures and benefits on a creative and individual basis.

"For instance, the whole issue of flexibility is very important today," she
says.  "Both sides are demanding more flexibility.  Many workers with
responsibilities at home want to be able to take time off to care for
relatives.  At the same time, new technologies allow some workers to work
outside their offices.  For their part, companies have financial reasons for
wanting people either to work part time or out of the office."

In the future, she says, this new freedom, will work to the advantage of both
management and labor-if they learn the art of making trade-offs.

A Penny Saved Is Two Pennies Earned


Fact:  in 1995, there were about 34 million Americans age 65 or over.

Fact:  by 2010, there will be about 40 million Americans age 65 or over.

By 2020, there will be about 53 million Americans age 65 or over.

By 2030, there will be about 70 million Americans age 65 or over.

This is called both a problem and an opportunity.

The problem is that under any reasonable understanding of the Social Security
system, the great bulk of these people will not be able to retire with the
same level of benefits that retirees have now.  This will lead to a stupendous
struggle over benefits and who will be cut the most in coming years and
decades.

The downside hints at the upside:  If Americans cannot reasonably expect
themselves to be cared for adequately by the Social Security system, they will
have to pay into their own private savings and investment schemes to support
themselves in their golden years.

The scope of the effort required is enormous.  If you look at it on an
individual basis and then on a collective basis, you get an idea of the money
that will be needed.

Take a baby boom couple who have reached age 45.  They have around 20 more
years to work, or so we will imagine.  Their combined earnings are $100,000 a
year (just to make it easy).  They spend almost all of that on living, plus
taxes, saving only a few thousand a year.  At age 65, if inflation stays in
the bottle at 3.5% per year, they will need to make almost exactly $200,000 a
year to equal the buying power of today's $100,000.  By age 75, they will need
$281,000, and by age 85, which they can be expected to reach, they will need
about $400,000 per annum.

To make it really simple, let's imagine that the lucky couple, whom we will
call Mike and Ginger Bayer, will need to live on $280,000 per year for the
entire 20 years between retirement and shuffling off this mortal coil.

It's reasonable to expect that Social Security will pay for some of this.
Unless there is some major upheaval, a couple paying in all their working
lives and getting every possible Social Security benefit is likely to receive
$60,000 a year by 2015, or about twice what they would have received at the
top end of the current benefits scale.  (Bear in mind that all of these
numbers are approximate.)

That means the Bayers must bring in about $220,000 per year from other sources
by 2015.  To do so, they should have a capital sum-that is, savings-large
enough to provide that yield.

Assuming mild inflation of 3.5% per annum, the Bayers might expect to earn
interest of 6.5% on their investments in 2015.  This means they need to amass
a capital sum of roughly $3,384,615 by 2015.  This sum will allow them to
spend at their 1995 level and also to save, adding to their capital, so that
they will have higher interest earnings in the future when they need them.

This would also allow them to leave a decent sum to their children, to provide
for any hazards that lie in the future.

Now here comes the part that will make the couple's hair stand on end and
should make Merrill Lynch start salivating.

Suppose the Bayers have the decent, but by no means lavish, sum of $200,000
already saved as of mid-1995.  Imagine further that they can earn 9% pretax-7%
after tax-on their investments.  This is not a staggeringly good rate of
return, but it is a fine historic rate.  To get to $3,386,000 by 2015, the
Bayers will have to save $4,947 per month.  Of a likely after-tax monthly
income of perhaps $6,000, the Bayers will have to save about five-sixths.

Impossible?  Well, maybe so.  So let's give the Bayers a break.  Let's say
they will be able to earn 10% per year, all in annuities, and that the year
they retire taxation is abolished.  This is unlikely, but let's be really,
really generous in our assumptions.  The Bayers will still have to save about
$2,528 per month, or about 42% of their after-tax income.

Of course, to the extent that the Bayers can spend less and cut their standard
of living after they retire, they will need to spend less.  But just how easy
is it to spend less when faced with the demons of boredom, opportunity for
travel because of the end of work and the possibility of declining health?

The Bayers would also have to save much less if they lived on their savings as
an annuity, using up part of principal and interest each month.  But just how
much do they want to risk outliving their capital?  And how badly do they want
to leave money to their children in this highly uncertain world?  For comfort
of mind, substantial savings are called for.

Obviously, if the Bayers could start out with $200,000 at age 35 and have 30
years instead of 20 to save up for their retirement, their payments to savings
each month could be far smaller.  The advantage comes from the gains made by
compounding the excess of the rate of return on their investments above the
inflation rate for a long period.

There are several key numbers-oriented points here.  If middle aged people
have any sense at all, they are terrified about their retirement.  If their
eyes are open, they will be looking to save as much as they possibly can.
Their advantage will be immensely increased to the extent that they can
increase the yield on their savings.  (If you save $20,000 per year for 20
years at 10%, you come out with $1,145,000.  If you can earn 13%, you have
$1,619,000.  If you can earn 15%, you have about $2,050,000.)

Now, multiply the Bayers by tens of millions of middle-class people preparing
for their golden years.

This surely must be the marketing opportunity of all American history.  It's
honest and straightforward, and the numbers tell the story.  It's a scary
story, but it's almost criminal not to hear it.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT:  READERS' QUESTIONS ANSWERED


Four FORECAST Fixes

By Kim Baker and Sunny Baker


In a business world that increasingly relies on technology, a number of
readers have posed quasi-technical questions to Forecast on fixing problems,
conquering software shortfalls and successfully building models for solving
sticky statistical analysis problems.  Rarely are the answers to these
problems in manuals.  That's why we have launched this new column.

Email us at kimbaker@aol.com or mleuchter@aol.com, or write to Forecast Q&A,
Faulkner & Gray, Inc., 11 Penn Plaza, New York, NY 10001.

In this issue, we tackle a continually vexing subject:  How to successfully
output those gorgeous maps and charts built with mapping, modeling,
spreadsheet and statistics software.  All too often, what you see on your
screen is a thing of beauty compared to what you print out.  Fortunately,
there are solutions to this problem.


Dear Forecast,

We use mapping techniques extensively for site location.  I spend several days
each month building maps that look good on my computer monitor, but when I try
to print them on the color printer, they look fuzzy and my labels [text] print
like characters made of blocks.  I'm working on an IBM PC and the printer is a
Hewlett-Packard.

Jan S.  Spokane, WA

Jan, it would help if we knew exactly what kind of printer you were using as
HP builds many different units, but the underlying issues are the same for all
printers.  In addition to the obvious differences between printer technologies
(dot matrix, ink jet, laserprinter, thermal wax and dye sublimation), there
are three kinds of printer "languages" in use.  What we're talking about is
the lingo employed to convert computer output into printed pages.

1.  The most basic printing engine simply prints a series of characters as
they are output by the computer.  Such a beast cannot print graphics, since it
is strictly character-based, with the shape of each character kept in the
printer's modest memory.  This is (fortunately), a dying breed due to its
inability to handle graphics and multiple type sizes and fonts.  Since you can
print the maps, albeit fuzzily, you don't have this dinosaur.  2.  The second
kind of printer-probably what you are using-prints each page as a series of
dots.  Type characters are composed of dots that shape each letter.  This
printer can print graphics, but its type reproduction abilities are limited.
This technology is used in non-PostScript printers, but font outline
technologies such as TrueType are improving type output from these printers.
3.  Last, and arguably best, is the PostScript printer.  Type is sent to the
printer as vector-based descriptions of each letter, called outlines.  The
printer prints the outline of the character with very smooth precision and
then fills in the letters.  Some images are composed of PostScript code, too.
Programs such as Adobe Illustrator create PostScript files.

The advantage of this technology is that the edges of lines used to create
letters and shapes are much smoother and can be enlarged or reduced with no
loss of quality.  PostScript printers cost more than other models because they
require additional printer-based computer power.  There's also a fee paid by
the printer's manufacturer to license PostScript from Adobe Systems, its
designer.  This adds a few hundred dollars to the cost of these units.

Problem #1:  Your problem with the label type coming out in blocks is fairly
common with non-PostScript printers.  You can solve that problem quickly by
adjusting to your printer's limitations.  Just make sure to use only the fonts
and font sizes included with your printer's software.

But if you need a greater selection of fonts than your printer has available,
install TrueType on your computer and then use only TrueType fonts.  TrueType
comes with Windows and Macintosh operating systems, and there are thousands of
TrueType fonts on the online services.  Look in the desktop publishing
software areas.

Problem #2:  As for your maps looking fuzzy, if you are using a color ink-jet
model HP printer, you may be using the wrong paper.  Regular paper suitable
for copiers and laserprinters absolutely won't work for quality color printing
with ink jets.  In fact, dust from conventional copier bond can clog your
printer's heads, requiring frequent cleaning or replacement.

Buy ink-jet paper made by companies such as Epson and HP and see if your maps
don't suddenly appear clean and vibrant with color.  This paper is available
at most computer stores and large office supply houses.  For top-quality
printing, try HP's Premium Glossy Paper.  It's expensive, but your maps and
color charts and graphics will look better than ever.



Dear Forecast,

We are assembling an investment report for our shareholders.  We tried using a
laserprinter output but our printer said it was not good enough for "repro"
(what's that?).  Would a better laserprinter fix the problem as ours is
getting old?

Shelley L.  Beaverton, OR


Dear Forecast,

I would like to put my charts on 35mm slides, but it's very expensive at the
photo house I use.  Is there a better way?

Brian H.  Truro, MA

The solution to both of these problems is similar, so we'll handle them
together:

Brian, we assume that you are creating colored charts on a PC (or Mac) and
then taking the printed output to a professional photo service.  There, they
essentially have to re-create your art and that is expensive.

A better way to handle this is with a device called a film recorder.  It
connects to your computer and reproduces your slides on conventional 35mm
film.  Film recorders are expensive, starting in the $1,500 range for a fairly
unsophisticated unit, so you may not be able to afford one.  But there's a
better solution.  Read on.

Shelley, essential to quality reproduction-that's what "repro" means-is
resolution.  For decent reproduction of type, you'll need a laserprinter with
at least 600 by 600 dots per inch (600 dpi).  For photos, 1,200 dpi is
required.  But here, too, there's a better way.

Use a service bureau.  This is a well-equipped shop that owns a printer of
sorts called an imagesetter.  This expensive device takes computer output (PC
or Mac) and renders it to photographic paper or film.  While your laserprinter
struggles with 300 or 600 dpi, imagesetters typically output at 2,500 dpi and
up.

That's the kind of resolution, Shelley, that will satisfy your print shop.
Service bureaus are found in the phone book under desktop publishing,
photographic film processing and typesetting.  Many offer free pick-up and
delivery, although we would definitely shop price.  Prices per page run from
$5 to $15 depending on output size, paper or film, output quality and
quantity.

Brian, you may need to do a little more shopping.  While every service bureau
owns an imagesetter (it is their raison d'etre), not all possess a film
recorder.  Call around or pick up a copy of desktop publishing magazine
Publish!  and look at the ads in the back.  Shops around the country offer
film recorder services complete with acceptance via modem and overnight
delivery of the finished slides.

Cost:  about $5 to $15 per slide depending on the shop.  Again, shop price and
look for a shop that outputs at 4,000 lines per inch (lpi), not 1,500 or
2,500, since that's not good enough for high-quality 35mm slides.


Dear Forecast,

How can I videotape the maps I make?  I use MapInfo on a Macintosh IIvx.

Hideko K.  Chicago, IL

We'll tackle this topic the best we can here, as it's really more suitable for
a book.  First, don't use a camcorder to shoot the screen.  The results will
be horrendous.

Instead, what you want to do is to capture the computer's internal video
signal and send that to the videotape.  The easiest way to accomplish this
minor miracle is to use an add-on video board, which can be purchased for both
Macintoshes and PCs.

These boards aren't cheap, unfortunately, with price tags over $1,000 for
quality models.  (Owners of Macintosh AV-models have this ability built in.)
Some computer configurations and add-on boards are only capable of 20 frames
per second (fps), but this makes for a jumpy video.  The videotapes you are
used to seeing are recorded at 30 fps.

With a fast computer, the right board, software, enough memory and a giant
hard disk, full-screen 30 fps is now possible on personal computers.  But
we're afraid, Hideko, that you're going to have to swap that IIvx for a faster
machine-at least a Quadra 6100AV or a Pentium 100 or better.

To capture video, you simply run your mapping session and send it to the tape
through the board's output jacks.  The owner's manual will explain the correct
procedure.  Look for a board packaged with useful video management and editing
software such as Video Spigot/Adobe Premiere where possible.  Your original
tape will need editing unless you're capable of a perfect session with no long
pauses.  And, this is assuming that the finished tapes don't demand the kind
of quality seen on TV.

For professional quality, you probably should seek professional help.  The
equipment required is quite expensive, and final polish will require an
editing console and an experienced operator.  Pros can also add nuances such
as captions, titling, music and effects-all for a price, of course.

You can also dump your "movie" to QuickTime on Macs, but this is an additional
step if your real need is videotape.

You can, however, use QuickTime and a QuickTime editing package to edit your
movie before shipping it to tape.

Last, if you do use slow computer, shoot screen shots of each change to the
map.  Then build a file of these shots, dumping each one over and over.  (At
20 fps, a 4-second shot requires you to dump the same screen to tape 80
times.)  The finished file can then be dumped to video and your machine's
speed won't be such a significant problem.  This will, however, take time and
patience on your end in order to get the timing and pseudo-animation right.
You can also use a product such as Macromedia Director to help you build your
movie.

The Northwest Trades Wood Chips For Microchips


The first half of the 1990s produced a substantial economic restructuring in
the Pacific Northwest states of Oregon and Washington, one that will fuel the
region's growth for the rest of this decade.

The federal forests, long a major source of timber for wood product
manufacturing in these states, were virtually shut down to provide improved
habitats for endangered species.  That forced thousands of logging and mill
workers to find new jobs.  Boeing Corp., the largest manufacturer in
Washington, downsized significantly in response to commercial airplane order
deferments and cancellations, as well as to the weaker defense and space
products market.

Despite these adverse developments, however, these states have continued to
enjoy healthy rates of growth.  The reasons:  the expansion of the
high-technology industry and the migration in of people and firms.  By the end
of 1995, the negative forces had moderated.

Better, new high-tech projects now underway should keep the Pacific
Northwest's economy climbing at a pace above the national average for the next
several years, and the region's increasing economic diversity will cushion it
against any mild cyclical downturn.

Oregon No Longer Trails

Oregon today might be described as the poster child of industrial
transformation, celebrating a series of announcements of new or expanded
high-technology facilities.

The list of companies boosting their production in Oregon includes San
Jose-based microchip manufacturer LSI Logic Corp., Fujitsu Ltd.  (Japan's
largest computer maker), Korean conglomerate Hyundai Ltd., silicon maker
Siltec Corp.  and Tokyo-based Komatsu Electronic Metals.  In addition, major
construction projects by Intel Corp., Integrated Device Technology, Inc.  and
Wacker-Siltronic Corp.  are already under way.  These expansions and new
plants will serve as reservoirs of strength for the state during their
construction and opening phases.  Total potential investment in these
facilities exceeds $10 billion.

The worldwide microelectronics boom, the availability of water and low-cost
hydroelectric and combustion gas power, a skilled and educated work force and
tax breaks under Oregon's Strategic Investments Program all played roles in
this high-tech surge.  Designed to attract major corporations, the SIP-in
which each county has the option of participating-caps property tax
assessments at $100 million for up to 15 years.  Intel, LSI and IDT all took
advantage of this program.

The strong economy boosted income tax revenues (the state has no sales tax),
and the state's gambling operations have been very successful, fattening state
coffers.  Thus, the major fiscal stress that some observers expected as a
result of state property tax cuts has been largely absent.

Much, but not all, of the new corporate investment is in the Portland
metropolitan area.  Employment gains in the past two years were widespread;
all the metropolitan areas (Portland, Salem, Eugene-Springfield and Medford)
added jobs either at or above the state average.

Still, Oregon is seeing non-metropolitan growth that has made the first half
of the 1990s look like a replay of the 1970s, when rural areas generally
matched or even outpaced metro areas in population growth.  (For an example of
one fast-growing nonmetropolitan area, see the sidebar above.)

Oregon labor markets tightened throughout last year, raising increasing
concerns among employers about the labor supply and putting pressure on wages,
particularly in construction.  Net in-migration continued its strong pace.  In
1995, the state's population grew an estimated 50,000; of that, 35,000 people
moved to Oregon from somewhere else, many from California.  Housing price
increases began to raise questions about affordability, particularly in the
Portland metropolitan area, where the median price of a home rose 12.5% in
just the first three quarters of 1995, reaching $131,500, according to the
National Association of Realtors.

Going into 1996, conditions in Oregon are ripe for increased pressure on wage
rates and higher labor force participation rates.  Employment is anticipated
to grow at about 2.5% to 3%, with a personal income increase near 6%, this
year.  This forecast is a bit lower than 1995's growth, which, when the
year-end figures are in, should reach about 4% for employment and 7% for
personal income.

Oregon's high-tech sector will continue to expand, given the backlog of
projects either announced or already under way.  Construction will remain
strong, with major industrial projects, a light rail expansion and continued
population growth.  The only dim note comes from the forest products sector,
which is continuing to decline due in part to harvest constraints, although
there have been some gains in secondary processing.

The rapid growth in recent years has focused concern in the state on issues
such as growth management, whereas less than 10 years ago encouraging growth
was the mantra.  The state's land use planning process is being tested in some
areas by the extended period of expansion.  Concerns about rapid growth
contributed to one county's decision not to extend the SIP incentives to a
large company last year, losing it to Arizona.  The growth problems are not
likely to dissipate soon.

Washington at the Crossroads

Washington State offers more of a mixed message.

The pace of growth in Washington has been slower than in Oregon throughout the
1990s.  The biggest reason:  the contraction at Boeing, which now has about
70,000 employees in the state, down from nearly 107,000 in 1990.  Layoffs at
both Boeing and the Hanford Reservation, a former nuclear materials production
facility, had a constraining effect on the state economy, which in other
respects was doing very well.  Statewide total nonagricultural employment
increased by 2.5% in 1994, and as of September 1995, year-over-year job growth
had slowed slightly to 2.1%.

Many observers had expected the economic braking effect of Boeing's work force
reduction to end early in 1995, but the company decided to reduce its work
force by another 12,000 during the year.  In 1996, Boeing will be an
essentially neutral force, with no additional work force reductions expected,
but no major hiring.  The November announcement of a multi-billion dollar sale
of aircraft to Singapore signals an improving outlook for Boeing, but this is
not likely to translate into job gains for some time.

On the other side of the state, the major contractors on the Hanford
Reservation also announced plans to reduce their work force by 4,800 during
1995 due to a slowed pace for the radioactive waste cleanup program.  Further
job reductions at Hanford are certainly possible in 1996.

Despite these temporary and permanent reductions in payrolls, the state
continued to grow in terms of total employment and personal income.  The
acceptance of early retirement offers by many Boeing and Hanford workers
contributed to the dampened effect of the work force reductions, but the real
story was strength elsewhere in the economy.

High technology was the primary growth force in Washington in 1995.  Software
employment expanded rapidly, led by Microsoft but accompanied by expansions of
several hundred other firms and a flood of small startups.  Biotech continued
to expand slowly, and medical electronics firms have also been doing well.

Late in 1995, thanks mainly to some key changes in Washington's tax code, the
semiconductor industry rediscovered the state.  In September, Intel announced
that it had chosen Dupont, a small town located between Tacoma and Olympia, as
the site for a manufacturing/research and development facility that will
employ 6,000 people within several years.  Two other semiconductor
manufacturing companies announced expansions of existing plants:  Matsushita
in Puyallup and SEH America in Vancouver.  In addition, BHP Steel, an
Australian company, chose a site near Kalama for a steel rolling mill that
will employ 230 workers.

These announcements were major coups for the state's economic development
leaders, who attributed the moves to a new sales tax credit available to
manufacturing companies that invest in plants and equipment.  Although the
state has no income tax, it has a high sales tax that-until the credit took
effect last year-applied to manufacturing equipment, inhibiting corporate
investment.

Other indicators also showed growth.  Airport traffic was up 12% at Sea/Tac in
the first half of 1995 compared to the first half of 1994, and several new
international routes were added.  Despite harvest constraints, the lumber and
wood products industry added 700 workers, and log exports were up 15% in the
first half of 1995.  Headhunters reported tightening labor markets,
particularly in the Puget Sound area.

In the early fall, the state's revenue forecasters reported higher than
anticipated collections, indicating a more vigorous pace in the state economy.
With problems in some sectors and considerable strength elsewhere, the state
moved ahead at about the rate of the national expansion.

Still, worries remain about the sustainability of current employment levels in
the wood products industry, with the federal forests essentially closed and
other stumpage sources unable to increase harvests.  Ultimately, a modest
resumption of production from Forest Service lands and perhaps imports from
Russia and Pacific Rim sources may help boost supply.  Secondary wood product
producers saw some drops in exports and total production in 1994 due to
weakness in both the U.S.  and foreign economies, but expect to show a
stronger performance by the end of 1995 and into 1996.

Structural change continues in the retail sector, with national stores
advancing into regional markets.  Several local chains, such as Ballard
Computer and Smith's Home Furnishings, have faced restructuring and
bankruptcy.

Exporters of agricultural commodities, timber and manufactured goods should
benefit from the exchange rate that makes dollar-valued goods more attractive
in Japan and Europe.  With Windows 95 finally out of the box, Microsoft and
other software companies expect 1996 to be a very good year, as millions of
business and personal computer owners upgrade their systems.  The expanding
semiconductor manufacturing sector will add further strength to the economy.

The Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast called Washington the "most improved"
state economy based on mid-year employment data.  The manufacturing and
construction sectors lagged the nation's, but growth in the trade and service
sectors continued at faster rates.

As long as the national economy continues to expand, Washington should do as
well as-and perhaps a bit better than-the U.S.  as a whole.

I'm Okay, Eurokay?


The European Union has decided on a name for its common currency, scheduled
for interbank transfer in 1999 and circulation as coins and notes in 2002.
But will ordinary Europeans ever cotton to the Euro?

At this early stage, most of them say no.  Public opinion polls in Germany,
without whose participation monetary unification would be DOA, run two-to-one
against giving up the Deutsche Mark.  Great Britain has already opted out of
joining.  And France has been crippled by strikes protesting the government
spending cuts necessary for the country to qualify for entry.

"There's a fear, especially in wealthy countries, of redistributing wealth,"
Klaus Friedrich, chief economist for Germany's Dresdner Bank, explained to a
group of financial journalists in December.  "People think Portugal and Greece
are coming in and will destabilize the currency.  They're not, because they're
very unlikely to meet the criteria for convergence in time.  People just don't
know enough about it."

The lack of popular support for the Euro doesn't discourage continental
policymakers, bureaucrats and bankers.  So far, the EU has kept very close to
its timetable.  And public opinion is malleable, especially since citizens
won't have to give up their francs and marks for another six years.  Not
wasting any time, the EU has already launched a Europewide public relations
campaign to promote the Euro.

The real obstacle to the common currency may be the economic criteria for
joining.  By the end of 1997, each member nation must have an inflation rate
of about 3%, interest rates below about 10.5%, and a stable currency.  Many,
if not most, countries will have little difficulty reaching those goals.  But
it will be harder to clear the remaining hurdles:  a government budget defecit
of less than 3% of the nation's gross domestic product and total public debt
of less than 60% of GDP.

The point is to assure stability.  "That will be taken care of by being a club
all of whose members are equally rich," Friedrich says.  In a recent report,
he gives the best odds to a union of eight European countries-Germany, France,
the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Austria and Ireland-although
others may join later.

What if the EU fails to sway public opinion in favor of adopting the Euro?
Many observers believe that would spell the end of the "European agenda," the
full financial integration of most of Western Europe.

Index of Tardy Economic Indicators


Pity the Conference Board.  No sooner had the nonprofit business-research
organization won approval to take over production of the U.S.  Commerce
Department's Business Cycle Indicators program, which includes the widely
followed Index of Leading Economic Indicators, than the federal government
shut down-not once, but twice.  Although the Conference Board now calculates
and disseminates the leading, coincident and lagging indicators indices, the
raw economic data that comprise them still come from the feds.

"It's ironic," says Michael Boldin, the Conference Board senior economist in
charge of the program.  "They properly decided to privatize in order to
concentrate on what they do well, and now they're not even able to work on
that."

At the end of December, just a day before the leading economic indicators
index for November was to be released, the Conference Board still hadn't seen
the data for four of its 11 components.  The report on new factory orders and
durable goods shipments was stuck in limbo and likely to delay production of
the index even longer.  Those figures hold considerable weight in the index,
on which many analysts rely to gauge of where the economy is heading in the
next three to six months.

Boldin points out that, in addition to the new orders data, economists are
most worried about whether the Commerce Department will be able to gather and
release labor force figures.  They are also impatiently awaiting disclosure of
the full methodology and details of the new chain-weighted method for
calculating gross domestic product, so they can revise their econometric
models.  "I don't think anyone knows how to live in a world without these
things," he says.

For now, the Conference Board will continue to use the same calculations as
the government.  But it has assembled an advisory board to recommend
revisions.  "We will also be soliciting ideas and suggestions," Boldin says.
"I would like to make the index as simple and transparent in its calculations
as possible, so that economists can make better use of it."

Starting in February, the organization will also assume responsibility for
publishing Commerce's Survey of Current Business, likely to be renamed the
Business Cycle Indicator Report.  It will include all of the data included in
the indices, plus explanations of any new additions or other issues in which
readers may be interested.

That is, if it can get the government-supplied data it needs to fill the first
issue.

Growing Grannies


Every nine-year-old knows that grandparents are supposed to spoil kids rotten.
But no one ever put a number on it until now.

According to a recent study by Packaged Facts, a New York City-based research
firm, annual spending by grandparents will rise to $25.6 billion by the year
2000, up from an estimated $19.9 billion in 1995.  The company used reports
from other market research companies, including Roper Starch Worldwide, in
preparing its 100-page, $1,850 report, titled "Marketing to Grandparents."

It projects the number of grandparents will swell to 62.8 million in 2000 from
57.1 million today, rising at a rate of 95,000 a month.  About 67% of all
Americans age 45 and older have grandchildren.

The report states that most "mature" Americans feel 10 to 15 years younger
than their actual age, but that many marketers persist in portraying them as
10 to 15 years older.  "In the past, grandparents have been stereotyped as
frail and feeble, but because of lifestyle trends, grandparents are perceiving
themselves as younger and having a more active lifestyle," says David Lummis,
project manager for the marketing report.  "I think the portrayals we see in
advertising are getting younger.  And the range of products and services aimed
at grandparents is widening."

One of the fastest-growing areas is travel, with such companies as Club Med,
Hilton and Westin Hotels pitching packages to active grandparents who take the
kids along.  He expects that over the next several years, travel will command
a greater share of grandparents' spending at the expense of such traditional
categories as toys and food.

Noting that three of the four major television networks (counting Fox) still
devote themselves to courting younger viewers, Mr.  Lummis thinks that as
advertisers and programmers recognize the growth and spending power of the
older population, the inequality will begin to dissipate.  "Money talks, and
once advertisers realize they can make money talking to an older audience,
they'll pursue them," he says.

Hispanic ZIP Code Update


Hispanic market research firm Geoscape International, of Boca Raton, Florida,
just released Base Hispanic U.S.A., a new database tool for penetrating the
burgeoning Spanish-speaking consumer market.  Available in diskette, CD-ROM
and printed formats, it updates the 1990 census block-area data, providing a
current look at the country's commercial and residential Hispanic
neighborhoods by ZIP code.

It provides country of origin, age, sex, income and educational attainment
information.  Besides 1995 demographics, it forecasts population for the year
2000.

"The 1990 census data is now six years old," says Geoscape president Cesar
Melgoza.  "Six years is a long time in the Hispanic community.  As a group,
Hispanics move more often than the rest of the population and have a great
deal of mobility within cities.  This is because many Hispanics are immigrants
and are unlikely to own their own homes.  They tend to rent, and renters move
more often than owners."

The database contains direct marketing tools-including current nationwide
lists of 7.7 million consumers and 4.5 million households-for businesses that
wish to tap the U.S.  Hispanic market through the mail.  It also provides
names and addresses of grocery stores, shopping centers and other businesses
that cater to this segment.

Geoscape also breaks the market into media regions for radio, television or
print advertising.  According to Melgoza, 70% of Hispanics listen to
Spanish-language radio, and television broadcasting in Spanish, including
cable programming, is growing fast.

Geoscape is aiming the product at both U.S.  and Latin American companies.
"Because of the devaluation of the peso, Mexican companies in particular are
concentrating on exporting goods now," Melgoza says.  "The cheapest thing for
them to do is to find Mexican immigrants in the U.S.  because these consumers
already are familiar with Mexican goods."

Pointing out that the the Hispanic market is made up of myriad subsegments of
people from divergent backgrounds and countries, Melgoza adds, "The
traditional way of looking at these markets at a gross level is problematic.
Marketers today must take into consideration the trading area for their
product or service and then look at candidate areas where the condition
exists.  Under that scenario, there will be many additional 'micro markets.'"

A version for Atlas GIS for Windows encompassing the full U.S.  Hispanic
market is available for $9,995.  Pieces of the database may be purchased for
smaller sums.

King of the Conceptual Road


When is a truck not a truck?  When it's still a concept.

Once you see it, it's hard to forget Volvo's new Environmental Concept Truck,
a pale blue one-of-a-kind vehicle with a bubble-shaped, traffic-stopping
design.  Its round-cornered contours are so striking that the ECT, as Volvo
executives like to call it, could have been built solely for visual effect.

However, the vehicle's primary purpose is to stimulate research on how to
build safe, low-environmental-impact delivery trucks for city streets.  The
truck is the end-product of an 18-month research project at Volvo's Goteburg,
Sweden, headquarters.  It was created not for sale, but as a laboratory
experiment in no-emission technology.

"ECT is not a commercial venture," says Karl-Erling Trogen, president of Volvo
Truck Corp.  Instead, he says, the vehicle "demonstrates solutions that can
create a new foundation for the development of tomorrow's trucks and
transportation infrastructure."

At this stage, though, the ECT has significant unsolved structural problems
and is not yet ready for the world's highways.  For instance, its ethanol
fueled and two-ton electric battery-powered engine may be ecologically
correct, but the battery runs down every 15 to 25 miles.  Volvo engineers are
hunting for ways to enable the batteries to function for longer stretches.

Volvo unveiled the ECT in Goteburg in September to members of the trucking
press.  In November the vehicle arrived in the U.S.  and was displayed to
journalists, fleet owners and lawmakers in three cities.  "We wanted buyers of
trucks and legislators to start looking at how trucks could be designed
differently in the future to meet new emissions laws," explains Phil Ramba, a
senior public relations specialist at Volvo-GM Heavy Truck Corp.  in
Greensboro, North Carolina.

In the U.S.  there is a movement toward tougher auto emissions regulations.
The ECT was designed in part to capitalize on the trend, which Volvo's
forecasters expect to spread throughout the world.  In California a new law
mandates that after 1998 at least 2% of vehicles sold in the state must
feature zero-emission technology.  On the East Coast, the Ozone Transport
Region, which consists of 13 states from Virginia to Maine, recently
petitioned the federal Environmental Protection Agency for stricter emission
standards for cars and trucks weighing up to 8,500 pounds.

Volvo designed the ECT to emit little pollution when running on ethanol and to
meet urban zero-emission standards when running on the battery alone.  While
the market for delivery trucks that require a battery charge every 15 miles is
pretty slim, Volvo executives expect to incorporate pieces of the ECT into
future designs.

Carol Birkland, a senior technology editor at the trucking magazine Fleet
Equipment, inspected the ECT at the Goteburg debut.  She gives high marks to
its safety and visibility features, which include huge, round front windows
and a very low height of nine feet.  "The wrap-around windshields give the
driver incredible visibility," she says.

In place of rear mirrors, the truck has remote video cameras installed in the
back.  The driver monitors the view from the cameras on a screen.  The low
height and round edges of the vehicle promote safety by minimizing collision
damage.

The ECT's most impressive feature is probably its unique steering system.  The
truck's front and rear wheels can turn in opposing directions, giving it
unusually good maneuverability-but only at speeds under 20 miles per hour,
when the feature is most useful.

Gerstner's Fancy Footwork


During the keynote address at the Comdex technology show in Las Vegas in
November, IBM Corp.  Chairman Louis V.  Gerstner, Jr.  talked about some
intriguing technologies:  microprocessors with several billion or trillion
transistors, intelligent agents and transponders the size of postage stamps
that can be attached to just about anything.

He noted that all these inventions are part of a project on "things that
think" underway at the MIT Media Lab.  The aim of the project is to install
artificial intelligence into everyday inanimate objects, such as door knobs,
furniture, glasses and shoes.

"A computer in a shoe?," he asked the crowd.

"Actually, it's not such a crazy idea," he continued.  "As I understand it,
you power the computer with every step you take, and when you shake hands with
someone who's also wearing a shoe computer, you establish a low-voltage
electrical connection and instantly exchange information through the
handshake-sort of a 'personal area network.'"

"What happens is you download to your shoe the person's title, what he does,
where he works, phone and fax numbers-maybe a digital photo or a video clip."

"If you think that's nutty, think about it tonight before you hit the sack.
Try to remember the names and faces and affiliations of all the people you
meet today.  Empty your pockets of all the business cards you've collected.
Then look at your shoes.  Not such a wacky thought, after all."

"So," he concluded, "in terms of raw technology, our industry's future is
extraordinary.  There's no letup in sight."

Will Big Blue be the first out with a prototype?  Don't count on it.

But IBM engineers are working on a number of new products right out of a
science fiction novel, if not Get Smart.  They include new imaging technology
that could allow users to store the contents of 16 million books on a
penny-sized diskette, an optical device that projects nearly atomic-sized
images, and a speech-technology interface that not only recognizes spoken
words but can also extract meaning from those words and respond to them.

Agricultural Forecasting Goes High-Tech


At precisely 12:01 a.m.  last November 9, an elite warren of offices in the
Washington, D.C., office of the National Agricultural Statistics Service, an
agency of the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, was locked up and sealed off.
Only 15 top officials remained inside to wrestle with a massive array of data.
The locks came off at 8:30 that morning, when the group emerged with the
monthly crop production report, a 50-page document forecasting harvests of
everything from corn to hazelnuts-numbers that would make and break careers on
commodity trading markets around the world.

Tight security is old hat around the USDA, the most authoritative forecaster
of farm output anywhere.  A premature leak of the agency's numbers might allow
a smart speculator to corner the market on, say, sugar beets.  Multinational
agribusiness corporations, commodity trading firms, farmers' cooperatives and
academics all engage continuously in their own analyses of crop and livestock
markets.

But none can match the resources of the vaunted USDA, which employs 1,000
full-time and 2,000 part-time staffers to visit farms and inspect ripening
crops each month to gauge the health of the agricultural economy.  In the
weeks before the November report was issued, the agency interviewed some
19,000 farmers and conducted tests of 2,000 corn fields and another 1,500
cotton fields.

The tests are only a part of the process.  The USDA has a vast array of
satellite photographs-so detailed that they can distinguish one farm from the
next-to help judge the volume of planted acreage.  Increasingly sophisticated
computer models crunch the numbers, as well as weather predictions from the
National Weather Service, to yield an impressively wrought report that tracks
in excruciating detail everything from the Texas grapefruit and Florida orange
crops to peanuts grown in Georgia and rice in Louisiana.  The department also
has information officers in every overseas embassy collecting estimates of
foreign production, critical data in forecasting import and export patterns
and price movements.

Given that sales of crops and livestock in the United States amounted to $188
billion in 1993 (the latest complete figures available), with farm assets
nearing $900 billion, the stakes are high.  According to the American Farm
Bureau, 3.5 million people work on farms in the U.S., about 2% of the adult
population.  The trade group estimates that through its ripple effect on such
businesses as supermarkets, restaurants, equipment manufacturers and financial
services firms, agriculture affects roughly 20% of the nation's general
economy.

Still, the USDA's forecasting capabilities are necessarily limited.
Predicting crop production is a maddening exercise, given to constant shifts
and revisions as weather patterns evolve, insects eat away at otherwise
healthy fields and orders for exports suddenly evaporate when a bumper harvest
materializes on some foreign shore.  An economist tracking employment, factory
utilization and consumer confidence can forecast a coming recession with some
assurance.  But farm forecasting is a tenuous process, subject to
serendipitous change with every passing storm cloud.

"It's a very difficult business," concedes Frederick Vogel, director of the
estimates division of NASS.  "Agriculture is seasonal; you only grow it once,
with no second chances to start over.  It's not like a factory assembly line
where you can slow down production for a time and then make it up later on
with overtime.  The weather can cause huge swings in production-from a big
crop to a major failure-in a very short period of time."

Adds Gary Benjamin, a vice president and economic advisor who specializes in
agriculture with the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago, "Computers have given us
better modeling and analytical capabilities.  But it seems that many of the
big surprises in the farm sector, particularly weather and export demand, are
hard to anticipate.  I'm not sure we're forecasting agriculture any better
today than we did years ago, although I'd like to think we are."

Counting Corn

The 1995 season was one of the toughest for forecasters to gauge in years.
Heavy spring rains across the cornbelt forced many farmers to plant their
crops very late, well into June.  Then came one of the hottest summers on
record, an infestation of the corn borer pest along a wide swath of the
Midwest and an unprecedented early frost in late September.  In June the USDA
was cautiously predicting that the U.S.  would harvest 7.8 billion bushels of
corn and 2.24 billion bushels of soybeans, but by November the estimates had
fallen to 7.37 billion bushels of corn and 2.18 billion bushels of soybeans.
The corn estimate was 27% below the record harvest of 10.1 billion bushels in
1994.  (Last year's actual harvest figures will be released early this year.)

The inhospitable growing conditions and unexpected import orders from China
set off a storm in futures trading.  By November corn was priced above $3.30 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, up 20% since mid-August, and it neared
$3.60 just before Christmas.  Overall, prices were the highest since the
drought year of 1988.

The experts breathlessly track these shifts day-by-day, with speculators
making their fortunes by anticipating correctly the next announcement, either
from the USDA, the government of China or the National Weather Service.
Farmers who don't want to wait for the once-a-month USDA estimates subscribe
to an array of newsletters that put their own spin on interim conditions.
Then, too, they're talking to university extension services, grain elevator
managers and neighbors down at the feed store or the local cafe.

For them, the forecasts are crucial:  the farmer who sells his corn crop early
in the harvest at, say, $3 a bushel could be missing out on a price of $3.50
or $3.75 if he gambles and stores it until the market improves.  Thousands of
dollars in income is at stake.  Multiply that by thousands of farmers and the
stakes rise exponentially.

Crop forecasting is an art as well as a science.  Dan Basse, market research
director of the Chicago-based forecasting firm AgResource Corp., also owns a
600-acre farm in Wisconsin.  "Forecasting requires a lot of judgment.  You
almost have to have grown up in the fields and know all the things that can
affect crops-from insects to the Russians buying on international markets-to
be able to make good decisions," Basse says.

"The average farmer's psyche is difficult to understand.  What price does he
want for his sow?  Will he sell it this year for slaughter or keep it for
breeding next year?  These are not easy questions to resolve."

The government tries to orchestrate crop production and inventories with its
set-aside and other subsidy programs, but most observers believe that such
government supports will be curtailed in the face of the budgetary cutback
mood in Congress.  In the aftermath of huge harvests last year, the USDA
offered to pay farmers this year to set aside 10% of their croplands in the
corn belt.  But in the wake of the poor harvest this year, the U.S.  will have
the thinnest so-called carryover stocks of corn and soybeans in more than two
decades.

"The set-aside is not an effective tool anymore.  Government policies are
often wrong," argues William L.  Roberts, an independent economist who
publishes the newsletter Agri-Business Perspective from Sioux Falls, South
Dakota.  "With more free trade of grains today and the opening of Eastern
European economies, the U.S.  can no longer dominate pricing the way it did in
the 1960s and 1970s."

When the USDA surveys corn crops, it targets uniformly sized plots and then
measures stalks per row, ears per stalk and then kernels per ear.  Private
forecasters even go a step further and measure the depth of each kernel.

Still more precision is possible on many farms now.  The latest combines
actually process wheat and soybeans as the crops are being harvested and weigh
them at the same time, Then they calculate the yield per acre by employing
Global Positioning System techniques to bounce signals off satellites and
determine exact land mass.

Computers, of course, have further enhanced the process of estimation.  Robert
Wisner, a grain marketing economist at Iowa State University, recalls, "When I
came here 28 years ago it would take a half day to generate a relatively
simple chart.  Today I whip the same chart out in four minutes."

Wisner keeps a database of crop conditions and production stretching back for
decades, he adds, and can search out historical analogs to match nearly any
recent set of circumstances.  Late planting with summer heat and early frost?
A search by the computer will find that conditions were similar in, say, 1974,
and will recall crop yields that year.

"Another big thing that's changed is the way information is disseminated
today," says William Uhrig, an agricultural economist at Purdue University.
"It used to be that you'd wait to get the USDA's forecasts the next day out of
the local newspaper.  Today farmers sitting in their offices at home pull the
numbers off the computer within minutes of their release."

Long-Range Weather Reports

Computers and satellites are also making weather forecasting more precise.
Paul Handler, president of Atlas Forecasts Inc.  in Urbana, Illinois, studies
sunspots and wind currents, among other factors, in predicting weather out six
months and more.  His weekly newsletter correctly predicted in July the
September frost that hit much of the northern corn belt.

"Agriculture production in many places in the world is correlated to other
places in the world," Handler claims.  "When India has a good monsoon season,
for instance, the U.S.  usually has a dry crop year."

An elite corps of agriculture economists, toiling for organizations such as
the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, D.C., hardly
concern themselves with the day-to-day vagaries of weather and crop prices.
They take a long view-the institute recently issued a forecast of agriculture
to the year 2020 worldwide-and worry over the implications of such cosmic
issues as global warming.

Such forecasting may be even more difficult than predicting next month's
rainfall in Iowa.  In the 1960s, for instance, many self-styled futurists
pointed at rising populations and predicted the world would run short of food
by the 1990s.  The subsequent Green Revolution that boosted crop yields helped
avert that disaster; the more populous world is being fed better today than
ever before.

Long-range forecasting contains more enigmas than ever before.  As in any
field, not just agriculture, the more variables come into play, the less
reliable the prediction.  Add to that unforeseen advances in technology and
the future becomes even harder to call.

Genetically engineered strains of corn and soybeans in research laboratories
promise to make crops invulnerable to insects and heat someday.  Farmers now
yielding 130 bushels of corn an acre may get 300 bushels or more in the age of
biotechnology.

"Advances in genetic development might allow us to leapfrog beyond anything
we've seen before," says Terry Francl, a senior economist with the American
Farm Bureau in Park Ridge, Illinois.  "But there's no way to be sure.  You
can't predict where something like biotechnology will take you."

Color Me Longhorn


Fashion magazines on the stands now tell us what colors we'll be wearing-or
avoiding-this spring.  But the Color Marketing Group, an Alexandria,
Virginia-based association of color designers, is already forecasting the hot
colors of 1997 and beyond.

That goes not just for apparel, where palettes shift fast, but for other
consumer goods that aren't replaced as often, such as cars, appliances and
home furnishings.  CMG has also released its predictions for next year's
so-called contract colors, those used in such commercial settings as offices,
hotels, hospitals and retail stores.

In November, its members gathered in Phoenix to decide contract color
directions and forecasts for 1998, but the organization will not release the
results publicly for another few months.  Contract colors tend to shift more
slowly than trendy consumer colors, so many of the hues forecast for 1997 and
perhaps even 1998 will already be evident this year.

In many ways, consumer and contract color trends are converging.  "Contract
colors have become more decorative over the past few years," says Laraine
Turner, CMG's president and the co-owner of the Jolley/Turner Group, a design
consultancy in Long Beach, California.  "People feel the need to make their
offices more homey because they're spending more time there.  The swing to
that happening now is that office products are invading the home."

So what's on the horizon?  A range of nature-inspired tones ranging from
gray-blue and glacial green to deep blue and red-browns.

But don't expect to hear such straightforward names.  CMG uses evocative terms
like Vizcaya Palm and Shiitake to label its forecasts.

"The entire ecology/nature thing will continue through the rest of the
decade," Turner says.  "There's a certain amount of awe going into the turn of
the century that's sending people back to basics."

Yet for every trend, there is a countertrend.  Turner notes a contrasting
movement toward very complex colors that have a high-tech component.  Those
deep metallic purple cars spotted on highways this year, for instance, aren't
like anything found in nature.

Vivid paint jobs will become even more common in the next few years, assisted
both by evolving paint technology and by the popularity of leasing, which
allows consumers to pick a car color they don't intend to live with for 10
years.

"We've been to the 1998 automotive color shows, and the big thing is the
sophistication and complexity of the paint colors," Turner reports.  New
technology allows auto body paint to shift hues under different light or from
different angles, so what appears a warm champagne color in the sun may shift
to silver lilac as you move around it.  "Some are even going from teal to
purple," she adds.  "There's also a perceived depth of color, almost 3-D, like
looking into a glass of water.  Even white has gotten very complex."

Northwest Passage:  Tri-Cities, Washington


The Tri-Cities area in Washington is composed of three towns-Kennewick, Pasco
and Richland-and a large land area of 2,945 square miles in Benton and
Franklin Counties.  Spanning the Columbia River, the Tri-Cities-with a 1994
population of 169,900-are the hub of economic activity in the southeastern
part of the state.

Tri-Cities is the transportation and processing center for rich agricultural
lands in both Oregon and Washington.  The Columbia River bisects the area,
providing a wealth of recreational activities and supporting a shipping
industry.  Wheat and other agricultural commodities are transported downriver
to the Pacific Ocean and industrial goods come upriver to markets in the
inland region of Washington and nearby states.

This area is home to the Hanford Reservation, a nuclear material production
facility from World War II through the 1980s.  It now houses major research
facilities, radioactive and hazardous waste cleanup programs and Washington's
one operating nuclear power reactor.

The Hanford hazardous waste cleanup program is a 30-year, $50 billion to $70
billion operation funded by the U.S.  Department of Energy and carried out by
local contractors.  The sheer size of the program provides significant
opportunities for waste technology companies.  A substantial environmental
technology industry has grown up in this area as a consequence.  Nearly 15,000
people are employed on the Hanford Reservation by government agencies and
contractors.  Led by the three major contractors on the reservation -
Westinghouse Hanford, Battelle Northwest and ICF Kaiser Hanford-many other
firms have located nearby to supply specialized technologies, to commercialize
technologies developed on the reservation, as well as to market these
technologies and services to other nuclear industry sites around the world.

The Tri-Cities are at the heart of a vast agricultural area that produces
wheat, apples, wine and juice grapes, corn and other commodities.  Some of
these commodities are barged down the Columbia River for offshore shipment,
making the ports in these cities important points for loading barges.  Other
agricultural products, such as frozen vegetables and wine, are processed
before shipment to markets.  Food processors located in the area include Lamb
Weston, Simplot and Seneca Foods.  Wineries located nearby are St.  Michelle
and Columbia Crest.

In 1994, the trade and services sectors comprised 62% of total nonagricultural
employment in the Tri-Cities.  The counties had a labor force of 96,700 as of
mid-1995 and an unemployment rate of 6.4%.  By the end of 1995, employment at
the Hanford Reservation had been reduced by 4,400 to about 14,660.  Many of
the reductions came in the form of early retirement.  To the extent that these
retirees stay in the area, the economic impact of the reduction will be
mitigated.  Current expectations are that the bulk of the layoffs are
complete, but future budget years may bring additional challenges for the
cleanup program, its work force and contractors.

To cope with these challenges, the Tri-Cities Industrial Council, along with
city and port economic development organizations, have created a marketing
group based on agribusiness, technology transfer and commercialization, and
western Washington businesses looking to expand or relocate.  Because of the
investment in office space, telecommunications infrastructure and
transportation systems to support the Hanford cleanup, the area has many
amenities to offer companies.  The agribusiness and technology efforts have
been quite successful, with new food processing plants and several new
technology firms announcing expansions during 1995.

The cleanup program and the growing agribusiness complex created a very
healthy real estate market in the Tri-Cities in the early 1990s.  Residential
building permits soared and substantial retail development occurred with chain
stores, such as Target, Eagle and Costco establishing outlets in Tri-Cities
malls.  But with job losses in 1995 came weakness in the real estate market.
The guardedly optimistic outlook for the Tri-Cities is contingent on relative
stability at Hanford.  If federal budgets force further major layoffs,
economic diversification efforts will face a difficult challenge, and the
local area will face higher unemployment and reduced construction.

Rural Renewal:  Umatilla County, Oregon


Located about 150 miles east of Portland, Umatilla County has much of its
northern border along the Columbia River and its southern border in the Blue
Mountains.  Transportation linkages are one of the county's major advantages.
Two major interstate highways intersect there, and it is on the Union Pacific
Railroad's main line between the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest.

The county population held essentially stable between 1980 and 1990,
increasing only 0.7% over the decade.  But between the 1990 census and July 1,
1994, the population increased by 8%, slightly below the state-wide gain of
8.4%.  More than half the population growth was due to net in-migration over
the period as the economic fortunes of the county improved.  By 1994, county
population reached 64,000, with the largest communities being Pendleton
(population 15,715), Hermiston (10,330), Milton-Freewater (5,865) and Umatilla
(3,115).

Umatilla County has what for Oregon is a unique mix of employers that includes
an army depot, a state prison, a major food processing/agricultural complex
and forest products firms.  The county ranked third in the state in sales from
farms and ranches in 1994 at $212.2 million, primarily from grain, potatoes,
peas, beans and cattle.  Food processing makes up the largest piece of the
county's manufacturing sector, accounting for 2,920 of 4,940 manufacturing
jobs in the county in 1994.  The forest products industry has outperformed the
state's, with employment reaching 980 in 1994.

Three government installations are part of the county's employment base.
Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution is a medium-security facility that had
375 Corrections Department employees and housed 1,534 inmates in mid-1995.
Blue Mountain Community College-offering basic skills programs, specialized
training for employers, including an industrial maintenance program for the
food processing industry, and college courses for transfer-is located in
Pendleton, with facilities in Milton-Freewater and Hermiston.  And the
20,000-acre Umatilla Army Depot, constructed in 1941, is a munitions storage
facility that straddles Umatilla and Morrow counties.

During 1996, plans call for the construction of an incinerator that will be
used to destroy munitions stored at the army depot.  It is expected to take
three-and-a-half years to build the incinerator, one-and-a-half years to test
it, and another three and-a-half years to destroy the munitions.  The facility
is scheduled to close in 2003.

The Pendleton Round Up, one of the nation's premier rodeos, draws thousands to
the county each September.  The area also offers the amenities of the Columbia
River and the Blue Mountains.  In 1995, the Wildhorse Gaming Resort opened.
This permanent 40,000-square-foot casino, located seven miles east of
Pendleton on the Umatilla Indian Reservation, opened in March and employed 265
people by mid-summer.  A 100-room motel opened in December.

Employment in Umatilla County has increased each year since 1987.  Annual
average wage and salary employment increased 17% to 23,130 in 1994 from 19,770
in 1987.  The broad-based gains in the period came from expansion in
manufacturing, trade, services, government and construction.

Such growth is likely to continue.  Wal-Mart has announced plans to build a
distribution center in Hermiston in 1997, capitalizing on the county's easy
access to highways for distribution.  One combustion gas turbine generating
plant is under construction and two others are being considered.

Umatilla County mirrors the pattern of many nonmetropolitan counties
nationwide, with flat (or declining) activity during the 1980s changing to
stronger population and employment growth during the 1990s.  And the impetus
behind that growth is hardly unique to Umatilla.  Food processing has expanded
with export opportunities and increased demands for convenience.  The prison
represents stable employment in a growth industry and the Indian gaming
facility is another growth activity that is changing parts of rural America.

Growing and Declining Industries


Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) predictions of employment growth by industry
follow a pattern of more jobs in services and fewer in manufacturing, the
model that has dominated the U.S.  economy since the 1970s.  The bureau
forecasts that the number of U.S.  jobs will rise from 121.1 million today to
147.5 million in 2005.  (Given that it also predicts a maximum of 156 million
available workers, this could mean that there won't be employment for as many
as 8.5 million unsuccessful seekers, or an unemployment rate of about 6%.)  A
full 25.1 million of the 26.4 million new positions that will be created
between now and 2005 will be nonfarm salaried jobs, the agency says.

The service-producing sector-which is wide enough to include such diverse
lines of work as engineer, lawyer, real estate agent, shoe clerk, teacher,
software writer, mechanic, fast food seller, clerical aide and maitre d'-will
account for 24 million of the new jobs.  Within this broadly-defined category,
7.1 million of the new jobs will be added in health services or business
services, 4.4 million in retail trade, 3.4 million in government, and 1.4
million in finance, insurance and real estate.

BLS says the service-producing sector's share of nonfarm jobs rose from 70.4%
in 1979 to 78.6% in 1992.  In 2005, the bureau predicts, services will account
for an overwhelming 82% of all U.S.  unemployment outside farming.

Turning to the goods-producing sector, the agency projects that almost all the
job gains-1.2 million new positions-will be in construction.  Manufacturing
overall should shed more than half a million wage and salary jobs, falling
from the 1992 level of 18 million to the projected 2005 total of 17.5 million.
In specific job categories, BLS sees increases in 2005 of 138% for home health
aides, 19% for janitors, 46% for restaurant cooks, 112% for computer engineers
and scientists, 48% for psychologists, 57% for legal secretaries, 54% for
preschool teachers and 70% for correction officers.

On the downside, the bureau foresees reductions in 2005 of 21% for farmers;
29% for sewing machine operators; 32% for household servants; 11% of
electrical and electronic parts workers and 51% for directory assistance
operators.

The bureau's projections for 2005 also indicate a continuation of the current
trend toward leaner corporations with fewer middle management positions.  BLS
predicts the number of executive, administrative and managerial workers will
increase 3.1 million to a 26% share of all jobs.  Although a healthy increase,
this is much slower than the 50% growth experienced by executives between 1979
and 1992.

The Work Force in 2005


The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that in 2005, one in every three
people over the age of 55 will be in the job pool.  The labor segment that
will expand most rapidly in the coming decade is workers aged 45 to 64.  This
age bracket, which currently comprises 31% of the labor force, will make up
39% 10 years from now.  The percentage of workers aged 45 to 54 will increase
to 24% from today's level of 19%, while the segment aged 55 and older will
rise to 15% from 12%.

The bureau also predicts that by 2005, 62% of the work force will be made up
of women and racial minorities.  The agency anticipates a total labor force in
2005 of 147 million to 156 million people, consisting 52.3% of men and 47.7%
of women.  The current breakdown is 54.5%, men, and 45.5%, women.  The gap
between men's and women's shares of the job market has been narrowing since
the 1950s, and the 2005 projection represents the most equal distribution of
the work force by sex in history.

In specific projections, BLS forecasts the proportion of whites in the job
pool will shrink from the current 78% to 73% in 2005.  About two-thirds of new
entrants to the labor market over the next decade-or 33.4 million people-will
be whites, while about 22.4 million whites will exit the job force, leaving
109.7 million whites in the job force.  While they will retain a clear
majority, their rate of expansion will be well beneath those of other races.

As the percentage of white workers falls, Hispanics and Asians will enjoy very
high percentage increases of labor force entrants.  Hispanics, who today make
up 8% of the pool, will see their representation climb to 11% in 2005.
Currently, there are 10.1 million Hispanics in the labor pool.  During the
next 10 years, 7.8 million more will enter and only 1.4 million will exit.
These changes will boost the total of Hispanic workers in 2005 to 16.5
million.

Asians, who now comprise the smallest group, with just 4.3 million workers,
will experience the largest gains of any racial group over the course of the
next 10 years.  Their ranks will increase by 81%, as 3.9 million join the
labor market.  Only about 746,000 Asian-American workers are expected to die
or retire during this time, so about 7.5 million will be eligible to work in
2005.  This will leave them with a 5% share of the total market.

On the other hand, African-Americans will not experience a significant
shrinkage or increase during this period.  Currently, they are the second
largest work force segment, with 13.6 million workers, or a 10.8% share.  BLS
predicts the addition of 6 million new black workers and the exit of 3.1
million.  These changes will raise the percentage of blacks in 2005 marginally
to 11%, giving them the same share as Hispanics.

BOOKS ETC.:  Marketing Goes Beyond Fun And Games


The Ultimate Guide to Sport Event Management & Marketing

Stedman Graham, Joe Jeff Goldblatt and Lisa Delpy

Irwin Professional Publishing

Burr Ridge, Illinois, $30.00


Sports Marketing:  It's Not Just a Game Anymore

Phil Schaaf

Prometheus Books

Amherst, New York, $25.95

These two new books by marketing experts shriek out an undeniable truth:
there's money, money and more money to be made in sports marketing, and each
year the proceeds get heftier.

Both books back up that central thesis with a plethora of anecdotes
distributed throughout the manuscripts.  In 1992, the Fox Network paid the
unprecedented sum of $1.58 billion to the National Football League for an
exclusive four-year broadcast arrangement.  The cost of a 30-second Superbowl
commercial rose from $850,000 in 1993, to $900,000 in 1994, to $1 million in
1995.  In return for wearing its shoes at the Summer Olympics, the German
sportswear giant Adidas gave free samples to athletes in 1972, but bestowed up
to $10,000 per participant for the same favor in 1976.  The list goes on and
on and on.

But while both works begin with the same set of inarguable facts, they proceed
in different directions.

The Ultimate Guide to Sport Event Management and Marketing is essentially a
how-to manual for people interested in entering the field, a textbook that
spells out how to rake in some of the lovely lucre.  It is pitched to
marketing professionals, as well as to college business professors who can
incorporate it into courses.

In fact, although one of its co-authors, Stedman Graham, is a professional
sports marketer, the other two co-authors, Joe Jeff Goldblatt and Lisa Delpy,
teach sports and event marketing at George Washington University.  Some of the
material has been pulled from their course work.

Sports Marketing:  It's Not Just a Game Anymore, by Phil Schaaf, is lively and
full of interesting details, but it has a less consistent focus.  Schaaf does
a thorough job of documenting such modern phenomena as battles between cities
to sponsor ball teams and the debate central to the 1994 baseball strike over
whether players' salaries should be pegged to owners' profits.

At times, Schaaf turns into a social critic and ruminates on whether allowing
finances to dominate the sports world is destructive to our society.  Yet at
other points, he writes as if his primary concern is advising Fortune 500
companies on how to get the most out of their sports advertising budgets,
weighing such issues as whether celebrity endorsements or stadium advertising
billboards offer the better deal.

Sports Marketing 101

The book by Graham, Goldblatt and Delpy is less intent on being all things to
all readers.

At the beginning of one chapter it quotes the legendary sportswriter Red
Smith's succinct observation about the eternal primacy of athletics in human
life:  "The Coliseum is the oldest building in Rome."  The Ultimate Guide
operates on the assumption that sports have always held a strong fascination
for people and that each society will find its own way to capitalize on that
fact.

Because it can be used as a college text, the Ultimate Guide is laid out
systematically and is full of pragmatic advice.  Each chapter covers an issue
of concern to budding sports marketers, such as strategies for managing event
logistics, techniques for reviewing contracts with sponsors and suppliers, and
advice for working with celebrity athletes.  The chapters all bear utilitarian
titles like "Emerging Opportunities" and "Critical Planning to Master the
Game," and they end with a series of questions designed to provoke further
thought about the topics.

The Ultimate Guide is full of helpful tips geared primarily to young adults
embarking on their career paths.  For instance, it recommends volunteering at
marathons to get a toehold in sports marketing, a break-in technique unlikely
to appeal to older aspirants or marketing professionals switching fields.

It attempts to assure us that this strategy can pay ultimate dividends by
pointing out that no less important a figure than Barnett Lipton-best known
for arranging a display of 88 grand pianos during the half-time show at the
1988 Superbowl-started his professional life as a humble volunteer.

All this may sound a bit too didactic-to say nothing of juvenile-for readers
already established in the marketing field.  Fortunately, the book is written
in a breezy and pleasant style, an attribute that should broaden its appeal
somewhat.  Nonetheless, it is tailored to the needs of beginners, who
inevitably will make up the largest portion of its readership.

A Fan's Notes

On the other hand, Schaaf, the director of San Francisco consulting firm
Pacific Sports Marketing, has written a book with something for everybody:
marketers, athletes, labor negotiators, business analysts, fans and even
culture critics.  He does best, however, when he sticks to analyzing the
intersection of sports events and product positioning.

Consider the creative marketing campaigns for the PowerBar, which in Schaaf's
estimation amounts to a modern Mom-and-Pop success story.  The
carbohydrate-rich snack, capable of providing vast surges of energy to fuel
athletic feats, was concocted by former marathon running star Brian Maxwell
and his wife Jennifer in their own kitchen.  Initially, the Maxwells promoted
the PowerBar by handing out samples at local sporting events.

Over time this simple, cheap, no-tech method grew into sponsorship
arrangements with more than 4,000 sporting events, ranging from the big bucks
NCAA college basketball playoffs to small-town charity auto racing events.
The company, PowerFoods of Berkeley, California, even went on to devise its
own sporting events, such as the PowerBar Women's Challenge, an annual
bicycling race in Idaho.

The PowerBar case illustrates that cleverness and persistence can overcome the
obstacle of under-capitalization.  This is the sort of moral that appeals to
Schaaf, who never quite seems to make his peace with the money-drenched world
of modern sports.

However, when Schaaf cares to, he can do a fine job of analyzing why sporting
events and big business are such a compelling match.

For instance, he cites the sponsorship of the Arizona Fall Baseball League by
Safeway Stores in 1994, and the role that basketball superstar Michael Jordan
played in that alliance.  By selling game tickets in its supermarkets, Safeway
was able to lure new customers into its stores and increase sales in its core
grocery business.  At the same time, Schaaf tells us, the company increased
its visibility greatly by associating its name with Jordan's much-publicized
crossover into baseball.

Schaaf explains over and over again that the real value of sponsorships to
companies is that associations with athletes and teams bring them closer to
the customers they covet.  It's no more complicated than that.  Being a
successful sports marketer is just a question of finding ways to turn athletic
audiences into consumers of goods.  The challenges lie in creating new
promotional formats and in matching particular products to specific events.

The author also excels at dissecting other oddities of the sports world, such
as the franchise system of team management and ownership.  In a chapter about
licensing sports merchandise, he quotes from an October 31, 1994 Sports
Illustrated article:

Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones has been complaining about NFL rules that
limit each franchise to a 1/28th share of league licensing deals.  As Jones
pointed out to the Washington Post last week, merchandise bearing the Cowboy
logo generated 28 percent of all NFL Properties revenue in 1993.  Still, don't
hold your breath waiting for the league's other twenty-seven owners to offer
Jones-or anyone else-a bigger slice of the pie.  Cleveland Browns owner Art
Modell put it this way:  'We are twenty-eight fat-cat Republicans that sit
around the league meetings and vote Socialist.'

Athletics are Secondary

Schaaf goes on to note that this sort of memorabilia fuels a $4 billion-a-year
industry that in most major sports is under the tight control of team
franchise owners.  The owners' right to enter sponsorship arrangements with
corporations enhances the value of team ownership well beyond ticket sales and
broadcasting rights, and has spawned a considerable
industry-within-an-industry.  The author contends that sometimes the actual
sports contests become secondary to the needs of these adjunct businesses and
franchise owners' profits.

Obviously, that's one of the aspects of the contemporary sports business that
trouble Schaaf.  In the last two chapters of his book he clarifies his
concerns.  For one thing, he worries that amidst all the hype, deal making and
profit taking, we have fallen into an approach to sports that is ritualized to
the point of boredom.  Schaaf seems to think that big business is in danger of
squeezing the life out of sports.

He quotes Chris Friden, a young and slightly irreverent sports journalist who
broadcasts on public access channels in the Bay Area, on the frustrations he
encountered in trying to interview basketball's Dream Team II in Oakland in
1994:

Shaq [O'Neal] and Derrick Coleman were great, but the system around the
players was uptight.  The system, not the players, is the barrier.  The system
creates and illustrates the image.  There can be no deviation, no frivolity.
It seems so ridiculous that they have a narrow definition of professional from
the media's standpoint.  ...  It seems that the uncreative system we have is
almost unprofessional, because it does not develop the interview.  I mean, how
many times can you ask, 'How do you feel about the win?,' and fool the sports
fans out there like there's any emotion.

In his final chapter, Schaaf gets to the point.  "The main issue in sports is
greed," he writes.  "Specifically, if greed will damage both the image of
competition, and the competition itself.  Major League Baseball generates
almost $2 billion annually.  The owners and players cannot agree how to divide
it."

How is it that a man who makes his own (presumably rather pleasant) livelihood
as a sports marketer can be annoyed with the industry's mega-profits?

In the last paragraph of the book, Schaaf notes critically that,

when CBS purchased the television broadcast rights from Major League Baseball
for $1.06 billion, the owners did not take the extra revenue (profit) and turn
it over to the consumers (fans) in the form of reduced ticket prices,
concessions, etc.  They spent it on labor, the players.  More free agent
signings, higher salaries, and higher financial risks, which increases the
costs of event production and presentation.  Fans have to accept management's
decisions.  Fans cannot ask for binding arbitration, or a new cost settlement
on professional sports spectating.

At last we learn who Schaaf really is.  At heart, he's not a businessman or a
social critic.  He's a fan, one who has written an entertaining book that
manages to explain in detail how the sports business functions, all the while
signaling his strong distaste at the industry's excesses.

CONSUMERZ 'N THE 'HOOD


IF ONE ACCEPTS THE ADAGE THAT YOU are what you eat, then the United States is
full of ambulatory burritos, chicken salads and hamburgers, while Japanese
factories hum thanks to industrious slices of raw tuna.

That's merely a fanciful illustration of the futility of trying to judge
people by a single trait.  Not that we don't often try

to categorize individuals, using labels to describe ethnic background,
economic status and political affiliations.  But since humans are the most
complex critters on earth, neither skin color nor the shoes upon a man's feet
truly say much about character or behavior-unless you're sizing up a guy
wearing Birkenstocks.

However, according to the developers of "lifestyle segmentation" systems,
people do reveal nearly everything about themselves in a singular way.  For
while you may not be what you eat, you are indeed where you live.  And even if
residence is not quite an ultimate destiny, geodemographics-with a little
psychographic data added for spice-still speaks volumes about consumers in the
here and now.

Since they first appeared in the 1970s, these systems have promised marketers
a means to find and categorize clusters of consumers.

In turn, this helps businesses to predict the wants, needs and spending
behavior of each discreet group, and find out exactly where concentrations of
individuals live.  Based heavily on U.S.  Census Bureau information, the
clusters are usually comprised of people residing in neighborhoods, including
rural, urban, suburban and an ever-growing panoply of permutations.

Indeed, where segmentation was once limited to a couple of dozen cluster
groupings, some of the industry's firms have created nearly 100 distinct
groups and subgroups.  Several companies give clusters straightforward names,
such as "Urban Professional Couples" and "Social Security Dependents."  Still
others have turned geodemographics into a delightful-or borderline smarmy,
depending on your taste-realm by using catchy terminology.  The "Young
Literati," for instance, is a market that's obviously as different from "Norma
Rae-ville" as the "Family Scramble" is from "Executive Suites."

All this makes sense, in that the cost of rent or mortgage payments in any
given 'hood is a reasonably good indicator of income and spending power.
Tenements and 3,500-square-foot homes are seldom found side-by-side.  And
since the consumers in each cluster ostensibly have similar demographic
characteristics, on the premise that people with like socioeconomic
backgrounds tend to congregate in proximity to each other, the consumers in
each neighborhood or segment should also have similar purchasing patterns.

That is, if the Jones family at 22 Maple just bought a 1996 Ford Explorer, the
odds are fairly high that just two doors down at 18 Maple, the keeping-up
Smiths are lusting for a new Grand Cherokee.  Or so goes the basic thrust of
lifestyle clusters.

"Of course, there's no such thing as a totally homogenous neighborhood,"
concedes Michael Pugliese, the director of Consulting Services for Strategic
Mapping, Inc., a Santa Clara, California-based firm that's been in the
lifestyle segmentation business since 1983.  "If you look at the smallest
clusters that can be produced, a mere five to 15 households in a specific
area, you're going to find consumers who don't begin to fit the profile to
which the cluster has been assigned."

A "Baby Boomers with Children" suburban household might well be flanked by
"Thriving Immigrants" and an "Older Settled Married Couple."  Midlife
professionals in their peak earning years may well live among retirees who
bought their homes 30 years ago.  Aside from Stepford, few neighborhoods are
full of clones.

"What any and all of the segmentation systems now on the market will do,
including ours, is help increase your chances of reaching the customers you're
after," explains Mike Mancini, the vice president of Marketing and
Communications of Claritas, an Arlington, Virginia-based segmentation firm
that with its PRIZM system has been an industry leader since 1971.  "Clusters
have an above-average incidence of the people they describe.  Using them
simply increases the law of averages."

That margin, adds Mancini, can produce a big payoff.  "For example, if your
company is planning to sell an upscale product nationally through direct mail,
increasing your efficiency just a couple of points can be worth millions of
dollars.  Costs are reduced if you avoid sending mail to consumers unlikely to
buy what you're selling.  Sales go up if you reach the correct target."

The Bon Marche chain of 41 department stores, for instance, has used
segmenting to cut down its direct mail costs, and in the process has learned
more about its customers.  Nearly a dozen times each year, the stores in the
chain promote an event through direct mail, sending out some 750,000 pieces.
Through the PRIZM system, Bon Marche found that most of the customers during
those sales came from three clusters.

With a cluster-coded map, the chain found a core group of 250,000 shoppers who
patronized the sales and lived close enough to the stores to respond to a
mailing within one day.  By mailing only to its best targets, the Bon Marche
sent out only 500,000 pieces per promotion, saving mailing and distribution
costs of $1.5 million annually.  It also learned that 90% of its business came
from 60% of the chain's customers, which allows it to focus its future media
and mailers even more tightly.

Going beyond the obvious direct-mail application, the use of clusters
influences business decisions as varied as where to locate a particular retail
store in a given town, where in the nation a company will find the largest
concentrations of customers for a product, where to make the most effective
advertising media purchases, and how to calibrate the creative pitch behind
the product.  Hence some of the more colorful descriptive words for each
cluster.

"If you know where your potential customers are and have a picture of what
they look like," says Pugliese, "segmentation can be of use for both strategic
and tactical marketing."

But while lifestyle segmentation has gained increasing recognition as a
powerful marketing tool, it generates revenues of only about $100 million per
year for the industry's major players.  (Besides Claritas and Strategic
Mapping, the list of major players includes Equifax National Decision Systems,
based in San Diego, and CACI Marketing Systems in Arlington, Virginia.  Other
companies focus more narrowly on specific industries.)

As these firms create ever-smaller clusters-where a couple dozen were a once
common breakdown, some companies now divide the U.S.  population into nearly
100 distinct types-these systems gain some strengths, yet take on certain
weaknesses.

Using more segments allows businesses to target their markets more precisely.
But the smaller the number of households in a sample, the less reliable the
results.  And working with scores of categories can get unmanageable, leading
some companies to cluster their clusters into broader groups.

Putting People in Their Place

Segmentation has come a long way in this country since Jock Bickert, now chief
executive of Denver-based Looking Glass, Inc., developed his "Lifestyle
Selector" system and founded National Demographics & Lifestyle more than two
decades ago.  "As long as humans have been interested in explaining puzzling
events, they have turned to typologies for answers," Bickert observes.

Biologists use typologies in analyzing organisms, as do mental health
professionals to better understand and treat the human psyche.  And while
marketers have long searched for typologies to understand "the often
bewildering array of consumer behavior," Bickert adds, "the quest to decode
consumers and predict their behavior continues."

In the U.S., the quest commenced after the 1970 census.  But according to Lynn
Wombold, CACI's technical director, the ACORN clustering system-it stands for
A Classification of Residential Neighborhoods-her firm produces was first put
together in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.  Prior to the 1970 U.S.  Census,
she points out, the Census Bureau's computer tapes could be best described as
user-hostile.  "Twenty years ago, segmenting neighborhoods was impossible,"
she says.  "While a variety of clustering techniques were available, the data
were not."

Interest in small-area statistics prompted the bureau to eventually develop
ways break its data into "block groups," which average about 350 to 400
households.  Then came the "block-level" data, which encompass about 30
households.  "But with each jump to a tighter focus, the bureau suppresses
some of the data out of privacy concerns," says Pugliese.  "Block-level data
can't tell you as much about the people in them as you can get with block
groups."

In the early 1980s, when the United States Postal Service introduced 9-digit
ZIP codes-or the ZIP+4 system-marketers believed they'd found a way to target
clusters as small as five to 15 households.  Equifax's MicroVision system, for
example, reflects the postal system's more than 23 million ZIP+4 areas.

Yet since ZIP+4 is essentially just a mail delivery system, segmented data
bases cannot rely only on Census Bureau information to get a reasonably
accurate read on households in this particular kind of division.  Says
Wombold:  "We must also use computerized files with information about consumer
preferences and spending, credit histories, and details from purchases,
affiliations, product warranty cards and other data."

Even then, there are questions about whether ZIP+4 clusters are simply too
small to have any great meaning.  "One of the weaknesses with ZIP+4 is that
there's just too much instability, when one or two households out of 15 can
skew the cluster profile," says Pugliese, who before joining Strategic Mapping
worked for one of its rivals.

"Say you also have credit data, and it shows one household buying a new car,
and another spending almost nothing.  Well, the people in the second household
may be saving for a European vacation.  And when they do take the trip and
spend the cash, it again throws things off.  I think you need 30 or more
households-at least the block group-to get reliable calculations, or to see
some statistical consistency in a neighborhood."

Mining the Data

Of the major lifestyle segmentation firms, all but newcomer Looking Glass have
built their fundamental systems on Census Bureau information.  (The Denver
firm's Cohorts II system is constructed on data from nearly 40 million product
warranty card questionnaires, from stereo systems to lawnmowers to home
appliances.)

What's different about each system is its other sources of consumer data.  All
have links to syndicated consumer panels.  But some have specialty ties to
databases from various industries.

For example, Equifax's MicroVision has strong links to financial services
companies, packaged goods and the telecommunications industry, among others.
The Claritas PRIZM and Strategic Mapping ClusterPLUS 2000 systems have had
success in the advertising game.  All five, however, produce useful clusters
and data, says James Mendelsohn, the manager of marketing research and
information for Perdue Farms, Inc., which uses two rival systems.  "But the
segmentation company that any marketer might want to pick really comes down to
its experience in your industry and how it fits with your particular
enterprise."

Like the kind of poultry various people prefer to eat, choosing a particular
system is almost more a matter of preference than of identifying any intrinsic
superiority.  In other words, they all taste like chicken.  But just as
drumsticks have a slightly different flavor than boneless breasts, each of the
big systems has its hallmarks.

With more than 3,000 clients, Claritas is well known for its PRIZM system, and
for the novel names it assigns to 62 separate clusters, ranging from "Blue
Blood Estates" owned by super-rich families, to the "Hard Scrabble" clusters
of older families in poor, isolated areas.  Starting with 1990 census
block-level data, PRIZM also develops statistics for finer, ZIP+4 analysis.

According to Mancini, Claritas figures that several dozen demographic
variables in six broad categories explain much about the different types of
neighborhoods.  These include social rank, encompassing income, employment and
education; household composition, given the age, sex, and family type of the
residents; mobility, which is the time of residence; ethnicity, from race to
ancestry and language; urbanization, or in turn, whether it's a town, suburb
or rural area; and, finally, housing, which is the physical unit and its
value.

To pull all this together, Claritas taps more than 500 million consumer
behavior records, including car registrations, credit histories, shopping
patterns and psychographic studies.  It also updates its system annually, from
more than 1,600 sources of federal, state and local demographic data.

"Things in neighborhoods change, but not as fast as you might think," says
Mancini.  "The same factors usually dictate who moves into a neighborhood.  We
routinely look at things such as building permits.  But even gentrification of
a neighborhood happens over a period of five to 10 years."

Like other segmentation companies, Claritas has found more and more target
groups developing.  In the past 10 years, it has adjusted for the surge in
immigration from Latin America and Asia, creating a cluster called "Latino
America," which includes largely foreign-born Latinos in young, blue-collar
urban families.  In another cluster are concentrations of older and more
affluent Asian and Latino immigrants, called the "American Dreams" segment.

Also similar to its competitors, Claritas clusters its clusters.  "You want to
provide data without it confusing marketers who don't need to know everything
about seven different clusters," Mancini explains.  For instance, one of
PRIZM'S natural groupings, the so-called "Affluentials," includes "Young
Intellectuals, New Empty Nests, Boomers & Babies, Suburban Sprawl and
Blue-Chip Blues," the latter meaning upscale blue-collar families.

The system can also be retooled to identify specific targets for an individual
business.  When Home Pro, an 800-store national home improvement chain, found
itself facing stiff competition from the likes of Home Depot and other
superstores, the company figured it had to remodel its image and find new
customers.

Known for its "no-frills-good-value" products, Home Pro identified five target
clusters within the PRIZM roster.  Calling it "This Old House-ers," the custom
super-cluster included the "Starter Families, Boomers & Babies, Upward Bound
and Suburban Sprawl," the kind of folks who spend considerable time and money
on home improvements.  Locating these budding Tim Taylors, Mancini says,
enabled Home Pro to target its advertising and creative approach.

Equally as venerable as PRIZM is Equifax's MicroVision segmentation system,
which got its 1971 start as National Decision Systems.  It has nine major
groups that include 50 clusters, with labels such as "Upper Crust,"
"Comfortable Times," "Metro Singles" and "Trying Rural Times."  It also has 95
other subsegments that go down the ZIP+4 level.

"Like the other systems, we start with census data," says David Tedrow,
product manager for MicroVision.  "At the block level, you can figure out
which household is making $1 million annually, the ethnicity breakdown of the
neighborhood, and the number of homes with two incomes or children.  But we
also get a tremendous amount of aggregate data from our parent company."

Equifax, of course, is a huge repository of credit information.  (Because of
privacy and legal concerns, says Tedrow, Equifax does not provide its
subsidiary with house-by-house data; ZIP+4 is as detailed as it can go.)  The
company also has alliances with at least 10 market research companies,
including Footwear Market Insights, SRI International, the Electric Power
Research Institute and Simmons Market Research Bureau.  "The data that goes
into our model," says Tedrow, "is always fresh."

And MicroVision segments can all be wrapped in with a client's own data base.
"By appending the MicroVision code to their data, we can help clients in a
variety of ways," Tedrow explains.  "Say a company wants to find a location
for a new outlet or branch, which is important retailers and banks.  By
looking at the clusters and knowing the customers you're after, it can help
you pick the right intersection for a store."

Still other customers can analyze large clusters while planning product
introductions or a major expansion.  Areas around Washington, D.C., to mention
one locale, include numerous clusters of affluent consumers.  But even for
customers who want to identify all of those clusters, segmentation reports
aren't necessarily expensive.

"A small entrepreneur with a file of customers can get a cluster analysis from
us for about $90 per 1,000 names," says Tedrow.  "Of, if you want to look at
Los Angeles and how many households might be your potential target, the cost
is about $100 per market area.  If you're opening a restaurant and want an
idea of what kind of people in the area like ultra-premium hamburgers or a
mid-priced sandwich, those clusters can be found for about $500 per product.
A small business can get a lot of information for $2,500."

On the flip side, he adds, corporations that intend to advertise in large
newspapers or on television might spend as much as $50,000 to $100,000 on
market segmentation.  "Telephone companies, utilities and insurance companies
have millions of customer records.  Their marketing campaigns are simply going
to be larger and more costly."

While Equifax has seen the same changes as Claritas, it also has observed
different users of segmentation products.  "While it used to be that retailers
such as Mervyn's and Nordstrom looked at who was buying what, we now see
suppliers, such as Levi's, also buying cluster analysis.  The suppliers are
finding the information useful when working with the retailers; it helps them
help the stores market a different range of products."

CACI Marketing Systems has produced U.S.  population segmentation clusters
since 1977.  It also sells forecasts of economic trends up to five years ahead
in neighborhoods, and 20-year forecasts for counties and states.  Its ACORN
system breaks up the U.S.  population into 40 different segments, with names
that are a bit more clear than cute.  "Top One Percent" is self-evident, as
are "Rural Resort Dwellers," "Military Proximity" and "Prairie Farmers."

Proceed with Caution

CACI's Lynn Wombold is not a fan of the ZIP+4 breakdowns.  "I simply don't
like them," she explains.  "The census block level group is the smallest area
of good data."  She also maintains that summary statistics from credit
bureaus-from bank cards to home mortgages, credit lines and auto loans-must be
used carefully.  "Income is often a derived variable, and the source of age
and other demographic data is unknown."

In combining census and non-census data that comes from multiple sources, "the
analyst must ensure the data are compatible with each other and are measured
in ways that do not result in undue bias."  ACORN thus makes heavy use of
consumer surveys to verify and validate what's found in its segments.  As much
or more than any other segmentation company, CACI presents itself as a firm
populated by rigorous statisticians and analysts.  "What distinguishes us in
the market," says Wombold, "is how much imagination goes into our products,
and the continuous measurements we make to be sure that the data are
reliable."

As for changes, Wombold echoes Mike Mancini's point that "changes don't happen
overnight.  Corn fields don't instantly turn into housing developments.  But
in the last ten years," she adds, "we identified one market that is nothing
but retirement communities.  And in the future, you might see a cluster of
'Downsized Middle Managers.'"

Strategic Mapping bills its ClusterPLUS 2000 segmentation system as a
"micro-marketing" tool.  In addition to its 60 lifestyle segments-which go by
straightforward descriptions-SMI adds the concept of "urbanicity" to its
cluster segmentation.  "Urbanicity is a neighborhood geographic measure
created by SMI to indicate a geography's proximity to an urban center, as well
as population type, housing density, type and structure characteristics," says
SMI's Michael Pugliese.

"The degree of urbanicity affects consumer behavior," he continues.  "For
example, someone making $40,000 per year in a small town can have the same
spending power as someone living in a major metropolitan center and earning
$100,000 per year.  Meanwhile, the goods and services that each of them
purchase can be vastly different.  So segmentation that simply lumps
demographics together without accounting for urbanicity can miss the mark."

Like its competitors, SMI also uses information from consumer data bases and
research companies, including National Family Opinion, Nielsen Media Research
and the Arbitron Company, among others.  Pugliese also explains that, "We also
have a close relationship with Dunn & Bradstreet, which has a file of
information on 86 million households."

When it comes to looking at clusters, most clients find six to 12 that are
important to their business.  "At the very least, most businesses will be
marketing to at least three clusters, and usually more," says Pugliese.

"But what I'm seeing that's new in our marketplace is the use of segmentation
for tactical purposes almost as much as for strategic concerns.  That is, a
packaged good marketer will break down its targets on a store-by-store basis.
The other innovation is using segmentation for business intelligence, to
analyze what the competition is doing.  If I'm going head-to-head with another
firm, I want to know where our clusters overlap, and where I might be able to
grab business through the use of what we call 'Atomic Clusters' and
micro-marketing."

What's in a Name?

Unlike other lifestyle segmentation firms, Looking Glass doesn't rely on the
census for its segmentation.  Its Cohorts II clusters are based on 65
different personal activities and interests, in addition to detailed household
demographic data.  Looking Glass considers its clusters among the most
accurate, since the information comes from consumers themselves.  The Cohorts
II groupings are built on 35 million product warranty cards.  "And we include
a fresh 25 million each year," says Jo Moniak, chief marketing officer for
Looking Glass.

Out of that data comes 27 clusters.  But what's also different about Cohorts
II is that each of the clusters is described with a name that suggest a
personality, not just economic status.

"Victoria" is not just a cluster, but a woman with a median age of 44 and
median income of $97,650.  She's a busy executive overwhelmed by emails and a
demanding travel schedule.  "Cindy & Dmitry" have a median age of 38 and an
income of $44,922.  They've got one kid, Dmitry drinks beer, and the couple
works on home improvement projects together.  The cluster known as "Elmer" is
described as having "sedentary men with fixed incomes and few interests beyond
their grandchildren and gardens."

So why the names?  "When we ran a distribution list of the names on the
warranty cards, we found that men named Elmer, Adolf, Otto and Chester were
indeed sedentary men," explains Moniak.  "'Bret & Tracy' turned up as older
Generation Xers on the rise.  'Russ' is a well-off young executive."

So if residence isn't destiny, then perhaps your first name guides your
economic fate.

No matter which system a company uses, the point is the same:  to know the
customer better.  In an era when consumers are growing ever more picky,
marketers must choose their targets carefully.

James Mendelsohn of the Salisbury, Maryland-based Perdue Farms, firmly
believes that, if you'll pardon the language, clusters can sell cluckers.  "We
don't just sell chicken, but a variety of poultry products," he says.  "And
different groups of consumers have clear taste preferences, be it for whole
chickens, boneless breasts or even Cornish hens.  In the pure vanilla sense,
we look at clusters and their known preferences:  the Hispanic and
African-American populations like the dark meat in chicken, which adds flavor
to many recipes.  Other groups-say where they don't do much complex home
cooking-prefer boneless breasts to whole chickens."

But in a more applied sense, adds Mendelsohn, Perdue looks closely at the
clusters near the grocery stores that Perdue supplies.  "We sell selections of
products to stores, including Perdue brand and private label poultry," he
explains.  "Those assortments are different from store to store.  But when we
analyze clusters, we might see opportunities to change the assortment that
store managers might not notice.  Cornish hens are not a high penetration
item, but in certain upscale areas they will sell to that segment of
consumers.  But in areas where consumers are cost-conscious, whole birds under
a private label might do better.  So this enables us to help the stores.  The
thing is, there's not a lot of room for mistakes in the poultry business; it
either sells or smells."

For all the work done in lifestyle segmentation, no cluster has yet been found
with a preference for bad chicken.  But even if consumers aren't what they
eat, where they live still says much about what they're inclined to think, do
and purchase.

Editor's Note:  Happy Birthday to Us


Having created the youth culture of the 1960s and 1970s, then defined the
yuppie era, the huge generation has now begun to move into-and beyond-middle
age.  Every newsstand this fall trumpeted the fact that the leading edge of
the Baby Boom is turning 50.

That means that over the next 20 years we can expect to see increasing media
coverage of the lives of older Americans, more products and services geared
toward their needs and perhaps more three-dimensional portrayals of them in
both advertising and popular culture.

As Leslie Wines points out in this issue's cover story, it also means that
business must learn to cope with the realities of an aging work force.  We're
likely to see greater opportunity for skilled part-time jobs, increased
retraining for older employees and even an end to corporate staffing policies
that encourage early retirement and favor younger workers in hiring.

The graying of the labor pool isn't merely an outgrowth of the Baby Boom's
shear numbers, by the way.  Less generous pension pay outs, low savings rates
and the insecure future of the Social Security system will keep many Baby
Boomers in the job market longer than their parents.  Lengthening life spans
and the nation's shift to a service economy-affording more work to people with
physical limitations than strenuous manufacturing jobs do-also play a role.

As the Boomers age, they will be more likely to experience mobility problems,
hearing loss and sight impairment.  Yet many companies have only just begun to
make special efforts to reach and accommodate potential customers who have
these disabilities, writes Bob Cole in "Discovering the Disabled."  Given the
Baby Boom's consumer activism and clout with marketers, the corporate world
should catch on fast.

Of course, predicting the future is easy.  Getting it right is another matter.
This issue of Forecast inaugurates a reformulated column by Steve Schnaars on
the back page.  Called Future Imperfect, it explores historical visions of the
future, some laughable now in hindsight, others startlingly prescient.

We've also added a new column called Technical Support.  With a
question-and-answer format, it's designed to help readers cope with marketing
and mapping software headaches.  I encourage you to send us your practical
questions.

Finally (here's where we come back to the aging Baby Boomers), we've increased
the size of our typeface just a smidgen, from 8.5 to 9 points, to make it
easier to read.  But a few of you may still need your bifocals.

Babies for Bucks in Malaysia


In marked contrast to nations whose leaders fear exploding populations as a
threat to prosperity, Malaysia's government has introduced tax incentives to
encourage greater fertility.  With a goal of full industrialization by the
year 2020, the government of this sourtheast Asian country is betting on
bigger families to build a large consumer market and provide workers for a
planned heavy manufacturing sector in the coming century.

Malaysia today has 19 million people.  Its population is predominantly Muslim
and young; about 37% are under the age of 15.  The government, concerned about
a shortage of workers (particularly skilled ones), wants to boost the
population to 70 million by 2095.  In the meantime, officials encourage
skilled foreign workers to take jobs there and provide inducements to
Malaysians to pursue higher education.

The Malaysian citizenry also is increasingly urban and Westernized, according
to a recent issue of the newsletter Market:  Asia Pacific, published in
Ithaca, New York.  Supermarkets and convenience stores have made their debuts,
and Western foods are popular.  The newsletter points out that Malaysia
represents an untapped market for supermarket products that are acceptable
under halal, the Muslim standards of dietary hygiene.

Whether full industrialization can be accomplished in the next 25 years
remains to be seen.  However, there have been a number of positive economic
signs in recent years.  For instance, Malaysia's Ministry of Finance forecasts
the nation's gross national product per capita to rise to $4,335 this year
from $3,948 last year and $3,519 in 1994, a 12.3% increase.

According to Global Trade Information Services, based in Columbia, South
Carolina, Malaysia was the 17th largest importer of goods from the U.S.  in
the first nine months of 1995, when it bought $6.4 billion of our products, up
from $5.1 billion and $4.3 billion in the same periods in 1994 and 1993.

MODERN AGE HOME IMPROVEMENT


Hindsight may be 20/20, but foresight is far less reliable.  Some views of the
future come through as if with telescopic vision, while others-sometimes from
the same person-display a surprising degree of myopia.  That's because, no
matter how insightful, forecasts can't help but be shaped by the times that
produce them.

Take the Roaring Twenties, an era enchanted with all things industrial.  In
August 1926, the prestigious magazine Nation's Business published an article
by Gerald Wendt, director of the Division of Industrial Research at
Pennsylvania State College, titled "The Synthetic House of Tomorrow."  He
observed that while many industries had moved into the "iron age," housing was
still stuck in the "stone age."

Steel, which two decades earlier had begun to transform skylines by supporting
skyscrapers, was rarely used in houses.  Brick, stone and wood were still more
typical.  That would change in the near future, Wendt said, forecasting the
use of steel framing and walls in residential construction.  "It is easy to
predict that the next decade will see a similar complete revolution in our
home-building," he wrote.  "Our present stone and wood construction, made
prehistoric almost overnight, will pass out swiftly as the carriage did."

Flat steel roofs would allow for rooftop sun rooms.  "Modern medical research
has demonstrated overwhelmingly the healthful action of sunlight," Wendt
noted, "and especially the extreme violet rays which our present glass windows
shut out."

The inside of homes would also change radically.  Wallpaper, floors, woodwork
and furniture would be made of plastics and resinoids, reducing fire hazards
and resisting stains.  Walls, draperies and just about every other interior
feature would be easily washable with a wet sponge.  Rayon, a hot new fabric,
would be found throughout the modern home.

Lighting would be chemical, rather than electrical.  Walls would be painted
with phosphorescent paints, gathering light during daylight hours and glowing
brightly during the night.  Color could be added.  Even the streets would be
coated with luminescent materials, lighting the roadbed itself and thus
eliminating street lamps.

Overall, Wendt foresaw a fireproof, stainproof synthetic house of the future
with a concrete foundation (he was right there), steel walls (wrong, unless
aluminum siding counts), rooftop solaria (almost anathema, given today's skin
cancer fears), synthetic stone floor bases (maybe, depending on
interpretation), rubber, leather or cellulose floor surfaces (not really),
curtains made of rayon (not unheard of, but other fabrics are more common),
and furniture of molded resinoids (wood and fabric are still more popular than
plastic).

But while Wendt got many of the architectural and furnishing elements wrong,
he did well when it came to electrical appliances.  He predicted that electric
refrigerators would make ice boxes obsolete and that each room in a house
would have an air conditioner.  He scored another hit by predicting that a
single thermostat would control both heating and cooling.  As the price of
power declined, he said, housework would become easier as the motorized vacuum
cleaner proliferated.

Wendt did best of all, however, when it came to communications.
Radios-novelty items at the time-would become commonplace.  He foresaw "the
transmissions of moving pictures on the air" and confidently predicted:  "Then
we shall have movies in every home."  More prescient yet was his prediction
that live events would be beamed directly into homes.  Today we call it
television.

Wendt went even further by predicting that by the end of the decade (that is,
by 1930), "the next war will be seen and heard around the world at the moment
it is taking place."  It took much longer than he expected, but anyone who
watched the Persian Gulf war will affirm the accuracy of that forecast.

Wendt's final prediction was a real long shot.  He believed that "the house of
the future will have a movie room, or better still, a news-room, where by the
turn of a dial, we shall be able to tune in and look in on Los Angeles, Miami,
London, the North Pole or the ringside.  It will be the center of the house,
like the old Roman Atrium.  It will be a triumph of science."

In 1926, that was only a dream.  Ultimately, of course, it became a reality.


Steven P.  Schnaars is a professor of marketing and chairman of the marketing
department at Baruch College, City University of New York.

His book Megamistakes (Free Press, 1989) evaluates the accuracy of
technological forecasts.

Mapping Review:  Is Mapping Going Mainstream?


Product:  DataMap:  An add-on module included with Excel 7.0 and Microsoft
Office for Windows 95.

Rating:  (Out of four stars)

Features:  *

Ease of Use:  ***

Value:  (DataMap is essentially free.)

Technical Support:  1/2

Documentation:  1/2

Data Included with Product:  **

Overall:  H 1/2

Windows Version:  Free with Microsoft Office for Windows 95 and Excel 7.0.
Requires Windows 95 or Windows NT.  Memory guesstimate:  16MB to 24MB RAM
(avoid using virtual memory as it's too slow when using Windows 95 with Excel
and the mapping engine), at least 30MB free space on the hard disk for Excel,
the mapping engine, maps and data.

Pros:  A (very) basic mapping module for Excel that, at the user's discretion,
can be installed or ignored during Excel installation.  It's reasonably easy
to learn and use, but that's in part because it doesn't do much.  However,
there are relatively inexpensive add-on packages available that substantially
expand the product's functionality.

Cons:  Limited functionality, although sitting on top of Excel, many features
germane to stand-alone software can be performed or emulated.  Nearly
nonexistent documentation.  No tutorial.  Questionable Microsoft commitment to
DataMap success, as quoted in this review.  No one seems to know if or when a
Macintosh version for Excel will become available.

WHEN WE BEGAN RESEARCHING OUR BOOK Market Mapping in 1991, it was difficult to
conceive of mapping technology evolving into a mainstream analysis tool.  The
products of the early 1990s were a either high-power, high-cost, hard-to-use
tools designed for engineers and scientists or what we call "presentation
mapping software."  These lesser products were capable of producing colorful
maps but unable to import outside data or analyze problems.

Commitment to the more powerful PC-based products of the era was a major
corporate investment.  It meant a big bill for the initial purchase and
maintenance, and hopping a plane for factory training.  Once trained, users
then hunkered down at a PC, manual in hand, and attempted to exploit their
newly acquired expertise.  The interfaces were as daunting as a CAD program.
Astronomical data prices also made the software that much harder to justify.

Today, mapping is easier, less expensive, and more accessible.  Even Excel 7.0
includes a simple mapping engine-DataMap-designed for Microsoft by industry
leader, MapInfo.  Selecting correctly formatted data cells within Excel and
clicking the "globe button" builds a simple map using basic global
cartography.

It's breathtaking (well, almost) to realize that mapping technology has made
the transition from a niche technology for highly skilled analysts to
something that anyone can run with Windows 95, Excel 7.0 and a well-endowed
personal computer.  But it's disappointing to see what an anemic offering
DataMap really is.  It's really little more than a charting alternative to the
pie charts, bar displays and grids included with previous releases of Excel.

What Can You Use It For?

Looking at it from the perspective of a mapping product, DataMap is a handy
add-on for some users because it's free.  With simple geocoding, existing
Excel spreadsheets can be used to build maps without leaving the Microsoft
Office environment.  The attribute and cartographic data that comes with it
can be used to explore the United States (at the state level) and foreign
countries to identify new markets for expansion.  Most users, however, will
need to study markets in more detail than it allows, so add-on packages are
required for deeper analysis.

The interface is simple enough, and there's a choice of several styles of data
representation, including dot density, graduated symbols, shading and pie
charts.  Beyond these capabilities, few options exist; although, in fairness,
the power of Excel stands behind DataMap, and some functions that might be
handled in a stand-alone mapping product can be accomplished within the mighty
Excel.

There is some data provided with the product.  We'll save you a call to
technical support or search through Online Help and tell you to open the file
MAPSTATS.XLS to get at the included attribute data.  If your hard drive is C:,
you can find it in:  C:\PROGRAM FILES\COMMON FILES\ MICROSOFT SHARED\DATAMAP\
DATA\MAPSTATS.XLS.

With DataMap, you receive basic demographic data for the countries of the
world.  For the United States, you also get population data by age, race and
ethnic group, zip centroids and a few other goodies.  Zip centroids appear in
the features dialog.  Initially we were excited that we could use such data in
this "free" product, but we found the function grayed out.  (After going
through a number of steps, we finally gained access to the centroids.)  State
data and county boundaries are included, but no city-level data could be
located.

Something for Nothing?

DataMap is free.  So, is it true that you get what you pay for?  Well, maybe.
For the cost (and problems) of upgrading to Windows 95 and purchasing or
upgrading Microsoft Office, you get a bare-bones mapping package of limited
capabilities.  Another potential problem is that Microsoft has provided almost
no documentation with DataMap.  It's fortunate that the product doesn't do
much, because you'll have to figure it out for yourself.

A more serious problem is Microsoft's commitment to mapping technology within
Excel.  As you can see from the following snippet of conversation with an
Excel support technician, we ran head-on into this problem:

Bakers:  "This product doesn't seem to do very much."

Excel support technician:  "This really is a demo version of Info Map's [sic]
software."

Bakers:  "Can we upgrade to a full version of MapInfo?"

Technician:  "No, not that I know of.  I suggest you call the Info Map [sic]
people."

As it turned out, the technician had very little information on the DataMap
module, and must have lacked even basic training on this product.  Calls to
two other techs revealed a pattern:  there was little knowledge of DataMap,
and both techs verified that the only supplemental documentation consisted of
an "app note" available from Microsoft (which neither could locate to send to
us).  One acknowledged that the department wasn't up to speed on DataMap, "but
they hoped to be soon."  We hope this isn't a demonstration of Microsoft's
actual commitment to DataMap and mapping technology in general.

Should You Upgrade to Use DataMap?

The writing is on the wall:  most users, especially in corporate environments,
will at some time make the transition to Windows 95 or a subsequent version of
it.  While it may not be this month, or in some operations, any time soon, it
will happen eventually.  For users of existing PCs, Windows 95 requires
expensive RAM upgrades, plus the purchase of a Windows 95 license and an
upgrade to the newest version of Microsoft Office.  This upgrade will not come
cheap, not because Windows 95 or the Office upgrade are expensive, but because
the RAM upgrade may cost anywhere from a couple of hundred dollars to as much
as $1,000, depending on how much memory is currently installed and whether
these chips can be reused or must be replaced.  (Users of older PCs may need a
whole new workstation for Windows 95, because the upgrade cost is impractical
or the machine too slow.)

Most novice mappers would be better off with a program such as Scan/US ($495
with an extensive collection of data), with its tight links to Excel, or the
easy-to-use EasyStreet with its new $495 price tag.

The underlying question is:  should you spend the time and money to upgrade to
take advantage of Excel's DataMap if you wouldn't have done it anyway to take
advantage of Windows 95?  For now, we would have to say "no."

But the news about DataMap isn't all bad.  Read on about third-party add-ons
for the product that make it almost cool.

ADD-ON BUILDING BLOCKS FOR DATAMAP

DataMap may well fail to impress with its limited features, nearly nonexistent
documentation and finite cartographic and attribute data.  But two add-on
products for DataMap are worth your consideration.  Among a flurry of
announcements, two software add-ons-both on CD-ROM-augment the restricted
power of DataMap and convert it from a product barely suitable for basic
demographic studies to one of at least some power and influence.

While neither product adds operational features to the DataMap software, both
contribute a mix of attribute and cartographic data that is the basis of an
effective mapping package.  Both are priced under $100, so they're affordable
additions for most Excel users and in line cost-wise with the rest of the
mapping market.  (If you had to spend $400 to reach the power of a $150
stand-alone product, then these additions wouldn't make sense.)

Still, serious market mappers will want a full mapping package, as no number
of add-ons to DataMap will address the limited functionality of the underlying
engine.  But for novice mappers looking for something, well, almost for
nothing, these packages transform something of limited capability into a
working, albeit unconvincing, mapping environment.


Product:  Maps, Data, and Mapplets:  Add-on modules for DataMap

Features:  ***

Ease of Use:  ***

Value:  ***

Documentation:  *

Technical Support:  ****

Data Included with Product:  ***

Overall:  ***

Windows Version:  $99 for the complete set on CD-ROM.  Individual Mapplets
available online via credit card from the Microsoft Forum on The Microsoft
Network.  They will soon be available on the 'Net at http://www .mapinfo.com.
Requires approximately 15MB for a complete installation of the Mapplets
package.  (See the requirements for DataMap above.)

Pros:  For $99, you can transform the bare bones DataMap into a useful mapping
environment and get five useful mapping applications.  Includes two tutorials
for DataMap, and more.

Cons:  No paper-based manual.

DEVELOPED BY MAPINFO, THE SAME PEOple who built DataMap for Microsoft Excel,
the complete Maps, Data and Mapplets collection fills in some of the potholes
on the way to successful mapping inside Excel.  First, and possibly foremost,
is the incorporation of two tutorials-Mastering DataMap and Great Map!-that
help bring users up to speed on the basic use of DataMap.  (We wonder why
something like this wasn't included with the Microsoft release.)

In addition, three small Excel/DataMap-based applications add demographic
analysis, territory management and what MapInfo calls "market performance"
abilities to DataMap.  Additional data sets include the "must have" U.S.
county and five-digit zip code boundaries along with additional demographic
data also by county on businesses, consumers and industry.  Demographic and
attribute data include income, home values, job classifications, health care
analysis for locating and operating care facilities, retail trends and a lot
more.

The most interesting Mapplet is "Marketing Savvy," in which users can "pin"
their marketing activities to a map within Excel and study the results to see
which plans work and which require retooling of some sort.  This is a tool
that makes regional analysis of sales and market penetration a snap.  Is the
billboard campaign working in the tri-state area?  How does it compare with
telemarketing efforts in the surrounding region?

For $99 plus the cost of the Windows 95 upgrades described in the review of
DataMap, this is a useful and appropriately priced package.  Recommended.

Data Included with Product:  ***

Overall:  ***

Windows Version:  $99.  Requires:  Excel version for Windows 95 with attendant
room for Windows 95.  To load the entire package requires more than 500MB of
hard drive space, but most users won't require all of the maps.  To load the
entire U.S.  requires about 200MB.  (See the requirements for DataMap above.)

Pros:  $99 buys you the data and maps missing from DataMap.

Cons:  Minuscule paper-based manual.  Clumsy install procedure for the
cartographic data courtesy of Excel.

SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT THAN MAPINFO'S entry, Maps, Data & Mapplets, Maps and Data
from MaconUSA consists of a collection of maps and well, data.  But while this
sounds mundane, the product adds substantial power to the otherwise anemic
DataMap.  As with MapInfo's add-on Mapplets, no new functionality is appended
to the Excel mapping engine, but the presence of better cartography and a
richer data set allows real mapping within Excel.

We tested the product by loading zip codes for California-a two-step process.
First, outside of Excel, the cartography must be selected and a multi-step
install procedure followed.  Then, inside Excel, the data must be selected and
the map built by clicking on Excel's new globe icon.  If more than one map can
be used with the data selected, you are given a choice of maps inside a dialog
box.

Once loaded, and after a brief wait, we had a map of California zip codes, but
little else.  Calling the company, because we couldn't find it documented
anywhere, we asked how to load a second set of data so that we could map
population density by zip code.  The support engineer said he would check and
call us back in five minutes.

Lo and behold, the phone rang about seven minutes later.  The procedure is
simple:  load the first set of data and then the second set within the same
spreadsheet.  Then, in the now larger spreadsheet document, select the data to
use and wait for your map to appear!

The "mini-manual" contains three example applications that will get you at
least partially up to speed.  The product ran without problems.

Excel users will have no difficulty relating to the Maps and Data paradigm,
although due to the design of DataMap for Excel, it's a little different in
operation than standalone mapping products.  Recommended.

FYI-FirstMap from Wessex

By the time you read this, Wessex will have introduced its own add-on product
for Excel's DataMap.  Complete with maps and data down to the neighborhood
level, FirstMap will take advantage of Excel's Wizard technology and step
users through the process of building maps within Excel.  Wessex-a large data
supplier-plans to provide even street-level cartography as well as a large
data set with later versions of FirstMap.  (This will actually be a series of
CD-ROM-based products for Excel.)

We haven't seen so much as a beta version of the software, but it sounds
promising and, list priced at just $69, it undercuts both the MapInfo and
MaconUSA's offerings slightly.  Wessex has also promised functional
improvements to DataMap, something not available elsewhere at this writing.

Mapping

Product:  Atlas Pro

Rating:  *** (Out of four stars)

List price:  $795 in the United States; $995 internationally

Pros:  Less expensive and less capable than MapInfo and GIS-oriented products,
but fully adequate for all but the most labyrinthine marketing analysis.
Quickly builds cosmetically attractive market maps (better than those produced
with MapInfo), and lets you create or import your own geographic data.  Best
for marketers who need quick demographic analyses combined with
presentation-level graphics.

Cons:  The product opens to a blank screen, which can be disorienting to new
users.  The installation routine is slightly brain-dead, requiring insertion
of all disks even when the required files are on a single diskette.  We found
minor bugs in the Macintosh version-we crashed it when attempting to import
incorrect attribute data types.  Atlas Pro's creator, Strategic Mapping Inc.,
reports this as a known problem that is being worked on.

DOS version requires:  DOS 3.3 or later, 386 IBM PC or compatible.  2MB of
memory and 4MB of hard-disk space recommended.

Mac version requires:  2MB of memory and 4MB of hard-disk space recommended.
System 6.05 or later required.  4MB of memory required for System 7, which
supports the product's Publish and Subscribe facilities and Balloon Help.

Windows version:  Forthcoming in late 1993.  You will probably need at least a
386DX with 4MB RAM and 4MB of hard-disk space for the program.

DISCOVERING THE DISABLED


A FEW YEARS BACK, MERRILL LYNCH & Co.'s senior management received a proposal
from one of the technical analysts on its market analysis team.  The idea had
nothing to do with business cycles or market timing.  Instead, the analyst,
Christopher D.  Sullivan, pointed out that people who are deaf or hard of
hearing could have money to invest.  But many won't invest if they can't
communicate directly with their financial advisers; and investment firms don't
typically market their services to this 10 million-plus sector of the
population.  Indeed, at the time, not one major Wall Street firm offered
special services to investors with hearing impairments.

So Merrill introduced a Deaf/Hard of Hearing Investor Services program, with
Mr.  Sullivan at the helm.  That was back in 1989.

Today, the company conducts investment seminars using sign language for people
with hearing disabilities, has five financial consultants-Merrill's term for
brokers-who are deaf and

has trained 1,200 other consultants on the use of telephone relay services,
which enable them to converse with people who can't hear voices over a phone.

The results?  "All told, more than 700 of our consultants have clients with a
serious hearing loss.  More important, we have more than half a million
dollars in assets under management for this population group," says Mr.
Sullivan, who has been deaf since the age of two.

In addition, Merrill Lynch is planning a pilot program that will use Braille
and large print to communicate with people who are visually impaired.

Merrill Lynch is one of a plethora of corporations to discover that catering
to the more than 40 million Americans with some disability means more than
just doing good-it's smart business.

For one thing, the size of the population considered disabled is huge, no
matter what system of measure you use.  According to projections based on a
U.S.  Census Bureau household survey taken in 1991 and 1992, nearly 49 million
people have some kind of disability, defined very broadly to encompass
everyone from the 1.5 million people who use wheelchairs to the more than 17
million people who have trouble climbing stairs without resting.  That amounts
to almost one out of every five people in the United States.  "When you throw
in relatives and caregivers, you're at or above 30% of the population,"
asserts Cyndi Jones, publisher of Mainstream, a San Diego-based publication
that describes itself as the "magazine of the able disabled."

Of course, the numbers presented by advocates for the disabled tend to look at
the market in the broadest possible terms.  Using the Census Bureau's
definitions, a little fewer than half of the people with disabilities -24
million-have severe impairments.

According to the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research, the
population includes an estimated 22 million people with hearing impairments, 2
million of whom are deaf, 1.2 million with partial or complete paralysis, 9.2
million with such developmental disabilities as cerebral palsy and mental
retardation, 120,000 who are totally blind and another 60,000 who are legally
blind.

The U.S.  Census Bureau calculates that this sleeping giant of a consumer
market-even though many, if not most, of its members are underemployed or
unemployed-had total annual discretionary income of $188 billion at the end of
1992.

Loss of vision, hearing and mobility skills commonly comes with age.  So,
because of increasing life spans and the aging of the Baby Boom generation,
this market will undoubtedly grow over the coming decades.

Yet, while the desire and ability to spot and penetrate new markets, along
with a sense of social responsibility, has sparked some of the business
interest in people with disabilities, many experts in the field insist that
the prime mover now is the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The 1990 federal law attempts to bring the disabled into the economic
mainstream by barring discrimination against people with physical or mental
handicaps in either employment or the delivery of services.  Like other
minority groups that have benefited from government prodding, many people with
disabilities view the legislation as a positive step in their efforts to gain
jobs and to receive the products and services that non-disabled consumers take
for granted.

The law's work is far from done.  Five years after President Bush signed the
ADA into law, declaring, "Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come
tumbling down," the National Council on the Disabled rhetorically asked in a
report to the President and Congress, "In 1995, can people with disabilities
finally have the same expectations as other people in their community-to live,
work, travel, communicate to, and generally feel comfortable in their
communities?"

The answer is:  Not yet.

Changing from the Inside

Still, positive assessments of the ADA are moving many companies from
unawareness and inactivity to concern and action.

The most obvious changes have come in the form of renovating business premises
to accommodate people who are blind or in wheelchairs; some of those
adaptations began long before the ADA was signed.  All the marketing and
advertising in the world won't help if potential customers don't have access
to a company's products and services.

For example, NationsBank Corp., KeyCorp and countless other depository
institutions have installed automated teller machines with Braille keys and
lower-set ATMs and teller windows for people in wheelchairs.  Many banks also
teach sign language to branch personnel, install teletypwriter (TTY) machines
in branches, print checks and account statements in Braille and hire outside
consultants to assess how user-friendly their facilities are for people with
disabilities.

The travel industry, too, has begun to make changes.  In the early 1990s, for
example, Embassy Suites Hotels, Inc., focused on accessability.  Tiny
bathrooms, an absence of railings and narrow doorways all combined to make
accommodations less than accommodating to guests in wheelchairs.  Management
also worried about the responsiveness of hotel staff.

So the company sought outside assistance from Opening Doors, a Woodford,
Virginia-based consulting firm that helps employees become comfortable
with-and thus better at-dealing with customers and co-workers who have
hearing, vision or mobility impairments.

As a result of the changes it made, Embassy Suites has seen an average annual
increase of 23,000 room bookings for people with mobility impairments and $13
million in gross revenues from guests who are disabled.

Other efforts long predate the legislation or go far beyond the requirements
of the law.  Among the corporations getting good marks from advocacy groups
for reaching out to and accommodating people who are disabled are Merrill
Lynch, AT&T Corp., General Motors Corp., McDonald's Corp., Prudential Co.  of
America, Marriott Co., Toys 'R' Us, Inc.  and NationsBank.  Their activities,
many of which date back a number of years, are generating follow-the-leader
responses elsewhere in the business world.

For example, besides taking an acive role in the passage of the ADA,
McDonald's introduced Braille menus back in 1979.  It was one of the first
companies to use people who are disabled in advertisements and has since
produced a television commercial in sign language.  "It was the right thing to
do," says spokeswoman Malesia Webb-Dunn.  "It also makes good marketing sense
to have all of our customers enjoy their meals at McDonald's."

Similarly, in response to questions from parents, relatives and friends of
children with disabilities, more than a year ago Toys 'R' Us created a product
brochure titled "Toy Guide for Differently Abled Kids."  Available from the
company upon request, the current version describes 117 toys appropriate for
children with a wide range of disabilities, promising to help them develop
auditory, language, visual, tactile, gross and fine motor, social, creative
and cognitive skills, as well as the often elusive self-esteem.

"This isn't a marketing vehicle; it's a response to customers who sought
advice in purchasing toys for children with different abilities," says Jeanne
McIntosh, product manager.  While the company does not track toy sales
generated by the booklet, she adds that letters and comments by consumers who
have used it warrant its continued publication.

Detroit's Big Three auto makers have also gotten into the act.  General Motors
provides customers with up to $1,000 in reimbursement for mobility adaptation
costs and vehicle "alerting devices" for drivers with hearing losses.  Some
24,000 GM customers have received reimbursements since the program started
three years ago.  The company also provides information on area mobility
installers and wheelchair-compatible GM vehicles.

"We've always been a leader in crash protection.  This is a crash avoidance
program for a very important market segment," says Dean Rotondo, a spokesman
for the company's North American operations.

But even among the recognized leaders, efforts to reach out to people with
disabilities is still fairly limited.  The "differently abled" toy catalogue
can't be found at every Toys 'R' Us store, for example.  And GM is only just
exploring the development of a flashing light alarm to alert hearing-impaired
drivers who are deaf if they've left the key in the ignition or if another
vehicle is honking at them.

page 38.)

This Year's Models

Spurred by pioneers such as McDonald's, AT&T, Nordstrom, Marshall's and Levi
Strauss & Co., scores of businesses are targeting ads at people with
disabilities and using them as models.  "We still have a way to go, but we're
seeing more handicapped individuals in advertisements than ever before," says
Elaine Brodey, executive administrator in charge of affirmative action for the
Screen Actors Guild.

Advertisers are also taking steps consumers without disabilities may never
notice.  For fees of approximately $300, the Vienna, Virginia-based National
Captioning Institute, Inc., that creates closed captions for television
programs and commercials, enabling viewers who can't hear to read the text as
subtitles with the help of an electronic device attached to the TV or a
computer chip built into the set.  The not-for-profit NCI, the largest of
several such firms, has captioned more than 20,000 spots for more than 400
advertisers since it first developed closed captioning in 1980, with usage
growing swiftly in the past few years.  The reason:  the huge growth in the
audience using closed-caption reading devices, since Congress mandated their
placement in all TVs with 13-inch or larger screens built after 1993.

In addition, NCI's market research indicates that 66% of closed caption
viewers are more likely to buy products advertised with captions.

Advocacy and service groups encourage the advertising trend through ad
competitions.  For instance, the National Easter Seal Society gives out annual
awards called EDIs, for "equality, dignity and independence," to media
campaigns that further the understanding of disability issues.  The
six-year-old program gave out more than 40 EDIs this year in categories
covering journalism, advertising and television programming.

ITT Hartford Life Insurance Companies-one of the 1995 winners, with six awards
in such categories as print advertising, broadcast journalism and television
programming-aims its broadly based marketing campaign not directly at people
with disabilities but at corporations that buy disability insurance for their
employees.

Using sports as a unifying theme, the company created a three-pronged approach
that focuses on disabled athletes.  It encompasses advertising in trade and
general-interest business magazines, producing such TV programs as "Taking
Charge:  Empowering People with Disabilities" on public television and "ITT
Hartford's Break Away," the first show devoted to athletic events for people
with disabilities, on the all-sports cable channel ESPN.

The company also sponsors national athletic events for people with
disabilities, such as a recent ski weekend in Aspen that drew 400
participants, and a wilderness adventure in Maine for its insurance claimants.

"Our big selling point," says spokesman Jack Hayward, "is in getting our
clients' employees back to work."

As an insurance company, ITT Hartford had long been involved with this market.
But as at Merrill Lynch, where Mr.  Sullivan's own experience informed the
company's response, the impetus behind ITT Hartford's focus on empowerment
came from an employee who is an athlete with a disability himself.  That's a
very typical route to change within corporations:  often the person
spearheading efforts to expand products and services to the disabled market is
a manager who has a disability or has a relative with one.

If the Carrot Doesn't Work

Many of the business efforts on behalf of people with disabilities, however,
clearly come in response to the ADA.

Despite angry rhetoric from some businesses about the "prohibitive cost" of
compliance, more than half of the accommodations for people with disabilities
have cost between $1 and $500, according to the Job Accommodation Network of
the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities.  Another
17% of them cost nothing.

But defending a lawsuit brought under the act can be much more expensive.

"There still is a lot of discrimination out there," observes Scott Wolfington,
associate publisher of Ability, a magazine dealing with disability issues,
published in Irvine, California.  "This has to spur lawsuits."

Indeed, it already has.  "We've seen an increase in the number of ADA-related
lawsuits over the past year," says Andrea de Gorgey of the New York law firm,
Hughes Hubbard & Reed.  "This trend should continue, especially since the
'undue hardship' defense is being viewed with increasing skepticism."

Adds Cyndi Jones of Mainstream, "The business community better wake up.  It
had a grace period from 1990 to 1995 and many people who are disabled are at
the end of their patience.  They feel businesses that ignore their needs are
saying people with disabilities have no usefulness.  This angers activists who
view lawsuits as their only recourse."

Not everyone agrees that suits play a big role in compliance, however.  In a
June 7, 1995 speech to the Association for Persons in Supported Employment,
former PCEPD Chairman Justin Dart called fears of more litigation a "myth in
the media."

"As of January 1, 1995," Mr.  Dart noted, "there had been roughly 600 private
and public lawsuits-affecting about one-hundredth of 1% of the entities
covered by the law."

Says John Lancaster, executive director of the PCEPD, "I really don't see a
change one way or another in the number of lawsuits.  People with disabilities
are becoming increasingly proactive, but their energies are more likely to
concentrate on lobbying, not suing, businesses."

Lawsuits more often focus on employment than on accommodation.  And because
the definition of disability keeps broadening, fights over who should be
covered by the ADA break out not just between courtroom adversaries but among
different factions within the disabled community, as well.

Still, most observers agree, the threat of litigation remains and activists
are more than willing to raise that specter at the same time that they promote
better routes to encouraging compliance with the ADA.

Chief among the better routes is education.  "I really think 90% of the
problem is awareness and attitude," says Joel Ziev, executive director of the
New York Society for the Deaf.  "For example, the hotel industry genuinely
wanted to help, but many managers simply didn't know how."  Today, he adds,
the industry is definitely more disabled-friendly than it was five years ago.

Lancaster cites two examples of how dialogue, rather than litigation, made for
positive before-and-after scenarios.  "A dentist in my hometown of Potsdam,
New York, was moving his office from a wheelchair accessible building to a
renovated private home, the entrances to which were by steps.  He was unaware
of ADA requirements, but once I explained how inexpensive it would be to
construct a ramp, he happily agreed to do so."

The second situation was somewhat more confrontational.  "A new restaurant was
opening in Potsdam and the owner didn't want to spend money to make it
accessible to people with mobility impairments.  I told him I'd never dine
there and that the loss of business from me and people who shared my views
would, in two years time, exceed the cost of the necessary repairs."

The repairs began shortly thereafter.

The Road Ahead

Progress notwithstanding, some advocates for people with disabilities say that
fragmentation within their communities is delaying the total elimination of
barriers.

"There are too many examples of people with disabilities not banding together.
We're almost at the point where amputees above the knee don't deal with
amputees below the knee, while similar differences crop up within other
groups," says Angela Miele Melledy, publisher of Able, a monthly newspaper for
the disabled, published in Old Bethpage, New York.

In addition, some people with disabilities don't want to be singled out.

Mel and Enid Zuckerman, co-owners of Canyon Ranch, one of the world's
top-rated health spas, wanted to build a resort for people with disabilities
this year but couldn't find an enthusiastic customer base.

"The interest wasn't there," Mel Zuckerman says.  "Most groups don't want to
be isolated; they'd prefer to mix with others if they went to a health and
fitness resort.  All we could do is design more rooms for people with mobility
problems, and make sure we have TTYs, captioned televisions and light alarms
for guests with hearing problems."

"One solution," says Jim Weisman, general counsel for Eastern Paralyzed
Veterans, "is to band together.  Too many organizations focus only on one
disability."

He notes that the American Association of People with Disabilities was formed
this year "and is striving to be the AARP of the disabled community.  If it
succeeds, it could become a very effective spokesorganization."

In the meantime, it and other groups work both separately and collectively to
promote understanding and further accommodation.

The ingredients are certainly in place for both.  They include a healthy anger
on the part of people with disabilities and their families, a watchful
government, fear of lawsuts, awareness that people with disabilities are also
consumers with disposable income, noticeable room for improvement and sheer
momentum.

Five years ago, companies that went out of their way to market to people with
disabilities stood out, winning new business and plaudits.  Five years from
now-and perhaps even sooner-companies that don't court this growing population
will be the ones that stand out.

Portrait of Disabled America

Based a survey of 30,000 households bewteen in late 1991 and early 1992, the
U.S.  Census Bureau estimates that 48.9 million people, more than 19% of the
population, have a disability, defined as having difficulty performing at
least one daily living activity or socially defined role or task.  People who
are completely unable to perform a particular activity or task, or who must
have personal assistance, were considered to have a severe disability.

Who are they?

Age 21-64 56%

Age 65 and older 34%

Men 22.9 million

Women 26.0 million

Severely disabled 24.1 million

Employed (ages 21-64) 14.3 million

Employed, with a severe disability 2.9 million

Of those age 15 and over:

Use a wheelchair 1.5 million

Have trouble seeing words in a newspaper,

even with corrective lenses 8.1 million

Can't see words or letters in a newspaper

at all, even with corrective lenses 1.6 million

Have trouble hearing a conversation 10.0 million

Cannot hear a conversation 924,000

Have no health insurance coverage 18.7%

A Consumer's View

Like many people involved with disability issues, Robert Cole became
interested thanks to personal experience.  He interviewed his daughter about
her frustrations as a frequent business traveler.

Debra Cole-who recently served as head of the recruitment office for the
university from which she graduated in 1992-had a delightful three years
traveling around North America heralding the strengths of her alma mater.

Well, almost delightful.

Unlike most travelers, she had the hardest time getting a hotel room in which
she could make phone calls.  Or enjoy television.  Or know that she would be
alerted if a fire broke out.  Despite assurances from reservation clerks that
she would have these basic comforts, she often entered a hotel lobby with
stomach pains, afraid those assurances would be worthless.

Ms.  Cole is deaf.  In order to use a phone, she needs a teletypewriter (TTY)
machine, also known as a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD).  To
have words accompany the images she sees on TV, she needs a closed-captioning
device that flashes dialogue across the bottom of the screen.  And to be
alerted to an emergency, she needs flashing lights, not a beeping alarm.

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, hotels and motels must have
these devices readily available.  But Ms.  Cole has found that many do not.
Or they do have them, but hotel personnel are:  a) unaware of the fact, b)
don't know where the devices are, c) don't know how to install them, or d)
don't want to be bothered.

"Deaf people have a better chance of getting the services they need at
expensive hotels," Ms.  Cole notes, "but Gallaudet University," her alma mater
and the nation's only liberal arts college for people who are deaf, "has a
limited budget."

Of budget and moderate motels and hotels-those charging between $30 and $75
night-Ms.  Cole rates Holiday Inn the best and Super Six the worst she has
encountered in terms of providing the necessary equipment.

"But even when hotels have a TDD, closed-captioning device and flashing alarm,
it is still a battle," she says.  "I've often had to write an angry note to
desk clerks asking that they let me look in the office so I could find the
equipment for them.  Sometimes that works; other times the hotel has nothing
and either I have to drive around looking for a hotel that complies with the
ADA or take a room and demand a discount."

Her other pet peeves include:

* being told there is a TDD in the airport that she can use to confirm travel
arrangements, then discovering it's in a different terminal; * seeing a sign
saying she can arrange a ride to an off-site car rental company by using a
handy-but not TDD-"courtesy" phone; * being told by hotel clerks that a room
is "for a person who is disabled" because it has railings in the bathroom; *
encountering service staff who handle their discomfort at dealing with someone
who is deaf by ignoring her.

"On the plus side," she adds, "there were looks of shock, then of realization,
that a single woman who is deaf could travel around the country.  I feel that
the more deaf people make themselves visible, the better their chances of
receiving services that hearing people take for granted."
