<U><B>1.INTRODUCTION</B></U>
<P>
The Federation of Community Legal Centres comes into contact with
a wide range of clientele  from across Victoria many of whom are
disadvantaged and marginalised. We also represent many young individuals
who come into contact with drugs and our centres witness at first
hand the impact of the use of drugs on their lives. 
<P>
Many of these young people use drugs for a wide range of reasons
which extend beyond 'criminality'. Alienation, depression, loneliness,
a need to escape the unpleasantness of memories of physical, psychological
and sexual assault, low self esteem, problems of boredom, domestic
violence, homelessness, the lack of identity caused by unemployment,
and a lack of familial support. Of course, this list is by no
means exhaustive but it serves to demonstrate that the causes
of drug use are complex. Solutions require a creative and holistic
approach which incorporates a commitment to the provision of support
mechanisms for those who use drugs or are likely to use them,
education as to drug safety and individual responsibility, the
provision of drug counselling and rehabilitation and the need
for a genuine attempt to rectify many of the social problems which
lead our youth and others towards the use of drugs. It is in this
context that we call upon the Premier's Advisory Council to make
recommendations that tackle a problem which extends beyond the
black and white need to control 'criminals' and 'drug pushers'
or a 'war on drugs' involving militaristic measures to deal with
users who are not the 'enemy' but rather to the grey areas of
the neglected and often vulnerable or disaffected members of our
community. 
<P>
We say this in the realistic context of the need to bravely and
objectively address the basic assumptions about the benefits of
prohibition of drug use in this state and Australia. Prohibition
tends to make drug users go 'underground' forcing them to conceal
the extent of their use, exposing users to health and infection
risks and forcing them into a life of crime in order to support
their habit and exposing them to the vagrancies of prison life.
 It should be noted that the majority of Victoria's prison population
are incarcerated for drug related offenses and that drugs are
readily available in our prisons in any event.  A number of Royal
commissions and Parliamentary Inquiries have bemoaned the fact
that getting hard data on drug usage is impossible(see Cleeland(1989),
Rankin &amp; Kerr (1981), (1979)  Prohibition appears counter
productive to finding a solution on drugs.
<P>
 Currently, there is little control over who uses drugs, who supplies
them, the level of contamination and accordingly, the risk to
life involved in their use.  <BR>

<P>
In 1993 the Public Health Association in its &quot;Principles
and Actions For Drug Policy Reform (see Appendix 1) stated that
in 1993, illicit drugs were estimated to be responsible for 508
deaths representing 2% of all drug related deaths and 9.5% of
person-years of life lost due to drug related causes. Deaths due
to illicit drugs increased 33% from 3.6 to 4.8 per 100 000 between
1981 and 1990. There is little incentive for those who use drugs
to find appropriate medical care or to try to 'kick the habit'
because of the fear of prosecution by the criminal justice system
and fear of police involvement. Most illicit drug-related deaths
are due to accidental overdose which are a consequence of the
uncertain purity of street drugs. 
<P>
So long as their is a lucrative black market in the drug trade
there will continue to be an increase in the trade as profitability
is the best motive for those who deal in large scale drug operations
and who often have little regard for the ultimate damage their
trade has on consumers.  The profit incentive also exposes many
people in authority to the dangers of corruption. For this reason
the Federation is of the view that by taking the profit element
out of the equation many of the problems of controlling the 'illicit'
trade in drugs will be obviated.
<P>
We also note that media coverage has tended to target specific
ethnic groups in the Western suburbs as 'the problem'. This approach
fosters an erroneous assumption that promotes racism, fear, antagonism
and insecurity in the community. The use of drugs is widespread
and is not confined to the Western Suburbs nor to a specific ethnic
group. We draw attention to the extent of drug use in many schools
both private and public(note articles over the years with reference
to the availability of drugs in schools such as Wesley and Scotch
College). Such assumptions also ignore the fact that the use of
drug abuse is an International problem and Victoria can learn
from other countries and their mistakes and successes. To deal
with the issue of drug reform as an issue of law enforcement is
to do so in a vacuum and to head towards the unpleasant risk of
creating an underclass of the magnitude that exists in the United
States.
<P>
<U><B>2.TERMS OF REFERENCE</B></U>
<P>
For the reasons outlined the Federation of Community Legal Centres
are of the view that the terms of reference for the Premier's
Drug Advisory Council are too narrow and will not successfully
tackle the complex issues surrounding drug usage in this state.
To presuppose that one can prevent drug usage without truly examining
the social problems that exist which lead people to drugs is,
on any objective view, not a serious attempt to examine and rectify
the drug problem (I refer to the Council's advertisement in &quot;The
Age&quot; 10/1.96. On page 4 outlining the public consultation
program)
<P>
We also note that the time lines involved in the lead up to the
making of written submissions is too short and does not correspond
with the complexity of the drug issue in this state. The shortness
of time has meant that endeavors to access statistics at the Department
of Justice has been impossible as they required two weeks to provide
such information. Also many people were on leave We also note
that this can only have placed significant strain on the Premier's
Drug Advisory Council. We make the following observations about
the terms of reference:
<P>
1. The references appear to imply that prohibition is the only
way to go. They do not open the way for the consideration of creative
alternatives to a system of prohibition which appears to be exacerbating
the existing problems.
<P>
2. The references only examine the use of &quot;illicit&quot;
drugs. They do not refer to abusive substances generally including
those that can be legally obtained nor do they tackle the problems
with underage glue and petrol sniffing, and chroming which are
significant problems in a range of suburbs in this state. (We
note this problem is not confined to the Western Suburbs but extends
to the Northern, South Eastern, Eastern, other outer suburbs and
rural areas).
<P>
3. The terms of reference emphasize &quot; law enforcement&quot;
rather than prioritising education and treatment programs e.g.
the ranking of the strategies and specific programs in Reference
Four and the militaristic terminology in the use of words such
as &quot;combat&quot;  promote claims that this is a &quot;war
on drugs&quot; rather than an endeavor to deal realistically and
in a sensitive way with the complex issues of safety for the users
and the community, responsibility, therapy and the scientific
considerations.
<P>
Accordingly, the Federation of Community Legal Centres will endeavor
to use these terms of reference to advance the debate and enhance
the list of the range of alternative policies which could reform
our drug laws and potentially benefit the entire community. We
also make this submission in the context of the Premier, Mr. Kennett's
own public statements outlining that he is not necessarily committed
to prohibition but to solving the drug problem.
<P>
<U><B>3.WHY THE CURRENT APPROACH ISN'T WORKING</B></U>
<P>
Currently the Victorian budget for drug services is $26 million.
We would suggest that given the need for services such as rehabilitation,
detoxification, education and counselling this is not enough.
Further a number of existing services have been closed or restricted
in their manner of operation without adequate provision for plugging
the holes left by such actions. For example, there are currently
only 36 withdrawal beds in Victoria funded under the new drug
withdrawal model in Coburg, Fitzroy and Dandenong. All of these
withdrawal units have waiting lists. This demonstrates a lack
of any real willingness to resolve the drug problem in this state.
To resolve the issues surrounding drug reform a genuine commitment
by government to the provision of resources, funding and services
must be forthcoming.
<P>
<B>THE FAILURE OF PROHIBITION</B> 
<P>
The policy of prohibition in Victoria has failed. Prohibition
has not suppressed the supply of illicit drugs, nor has it reduced
their use.
<P>
Prohibition policies are fatally flawed because they assume it
is possible to prevent supply and use of illicit drugs by enforcing
criminal sanctions.  This is assumption runs contrary to the experience
in Victoria where considerable resources have been devoted to
enforcing the law without any reduction in supply/use.   
<P>
The failure of current policy is no more evident than the existence
of drugs in Victorian Prisons.
<P>
Prohibition cannot be successful because some citizens will always
seek to use drugs regardless of penalties. In these circumstances,
prohibition policies can only increase the harm caused by drug
use.  
<P>
<B>PROHIBITION CAUSES CRIME</B>
<P>
It has created a black market where drugs are only available at
artificially inflated prices.  It is estimated prohibition is
directly responsible for a significant proportion of all property
crime because users are forced to commit crimes to pay for drugs.
 It is also clear some violent crimes are related to the large
profits associated with the drug trade.  
<P>
As a consequence a significant percentage of Victoria's prison
population is in jail as a direct consequence of current drug
laws, for drug related property crime and drug offenses themselves.
 For example, it is estimated that 80% of women and 60% of men
in prison are there on drug related charges ( see Helen Barnacle,
Drug Program Manager, Task Force Community Agency The Editorial
'The Age' 5/12/95)<BR>

<P>
<B>PROHIBITION ENCOURAGES THE SALE OF ILLICIT  DRUGS</B>
<P>
Prohibition increases the potential for profit from the sale of
drugs and enables pyramid supply structures to be established
to generate huge profits.  This selling structure relies upon
the active recruitment of new users and the introduction of new
products to existing users. Odyssey House estimates the cost borne
by the community for each dependent user in Melbourne is $75,000
per year, $53,000 coming from drug related crime. <BR>

<P>
<B>PROHIBITION ENCOURAGES CORRUPTION</B>
<P>
The black market means very large sums of money are available
to influence those required to enforce the law.  There is great
potential for corruption at every stage in the process.  The NSW
Police Royal Commission has demonstrated how prohibition promotes
corruption and how once entrenched, such corruption can threaten
the entire criminal justice system.  It would be unrealistic to
assume the Victorian Police are immune to such pressure.   <BR>

<P>
<B>PROHIBITION POLICIES ARE IMPLEMENTED AT ENORMOUS FINANCIAL
COST</B>
<P>
It is estimated $250 million per annum is spent Australia wide
on drug law enforcement.(Marks  &quot;Costs of Prohibition&quot;
in Fox &amp; Mathews Drugs and the Law Sydney Allen &amp; Unwin
1991)  The resources of Victoria Police, the Office of the Director
of Public Prosecutions and the Courts are devoted to drug prosecutions
without any evidence of a reduction in supply or drug use.  
<P>
Based on the provisional statistics released by Commissioner Comrie
in July, 1995, in the year 1994/95 the police processed  people
for use or possess a drug of dependence (excluding trafficking
and cultivation) resulting in the laying of 19,959 charges. This
means that more than 10,000 times the police were required to
apprehend offenders, transport them to the police station, conduct
a taped record of interview in most cases, charge and fingerprint
the defendant, produce statements of lead up questioning, and
prepare the brief for the prosecutor. The matter must then be
processed by the courts. In 1994 the magistrate's court disposed
of 21, 094 charges relating to possession or use of a drug of
dependence/ addiction, excluding trafficking or cultivation.
<P>
The failure of such activities is demonstrated by statistics which
show in Victoria the overwhelming majority of drug prosecutions
were of users not traffickers. The Health and Community Services
Victorian Drug Strategy statistics Handbook in Table 45 (page7)
states that reported offenses for 1991-1992 for Cannabis  possession/use
were 16,014 and for  trafficking and manufacture totalled 4,777.
<BR>

<P>
<B>PROHIBITION CONCENTRATES RESOURCES ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE
EXPENSE OF HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES</B>
<P>
The Victorian and Federal Governments have limited resources to
address this problem.  Prohibition requires resources to first
and foremost be directed to law enforcement. As stated above an
estimated $250 million per annum is spent Australia wide on drug
law enforcement. It is estimated Victoria's portion of that cost
is significantly more than the  $26 million per annum spent in
Victoria on drug services  Strategies which actually address the
problems caused by drug use are given second priority and in times
of recession the funding for such strategies may be severely reduced
or withdrawn altogether.<BR>

<P>
<B>PROHIBITION HAS ERODED CIVIL LIBERTIES</B>
<P>
State and Federal Governments have acknowledged prohibition is
not succeeding by attempting to secure more convictions by &quot;streamlining&quot;
the investigation and prosecution process.  This has been done
by interfering with the rights of individuals, such as privacy,
the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.
<P>
Federal authorities can now investigate the financial affairs
of anyone who deposits $10,000.00 or more in cash, on the suspicion
the money is associated with illicit drugs.  Law enforcement agencies
have been given wide powers of investigation in relation to drug
offenses.  In Victoria, the police have been granted extensive
investigation powers enabling them to demand name and addresses
of suspects obtain finger prints and conduct forensic procedures
including body cavity searches. The Courts will  accept the uncorroborated
evidence of the police in drug trials.  In some instances the
onus of proof has been reversed, requiring persons accused of
certain drug offenses to prove their innocence.
<P>
Despite these changes, there is no evidence to suggest  an overall
reduction of  the supply or use of illicit drugs.  In these circumstances
the erosion of fundamental rights  cannot be justified.
<P>
If we persist with drug prohibition,  future strategies will be
focused on securing convictions and increasing penalties.  This
can only result in a greater erosion of civil liberties.  These
&quot;solutions&quot; may enable governments to be seen to be
taking decisive action but these measures have serious consequences
for civil liberties.<BR>

<P>
<B>PROHIBITION OPERATES MORE HARSHLY ON USERS THAN THOSE WHO TRAFFIC</B>
<P>
Statistics for reporting of drug offenses in Victoria  for 1991-1992
show 20,000 users/possessors  compared with 3,209 for  manufacture/cultivation
of drugs for the same period. (see Table 45-page 7 of  H.&amp;C.S.
Vic. Drug Strategy Statistics Handbook) This suggests users are
much more likely<B> </B>to be prosecuted than those who manufacture
illicit drugs. The same source indicates 82% of convictions for
drug offenses in the Magistrates' Court were for the lesser offenses
of possession and use. Suppliers have money and power enabling
them to avoid detection and making it more likely they can successfully
avoid serious penalties.
<P>
The penalties flowing from prosecution are also likely to be more
severe for users.  Without support an addict is unlikely to be
able to comply with the sentencing order which means she or he
is at risk of further prosecution for breach.  Incarceration without
treatment may also pose serious health risks.  <BR>

<P>
<B>PROHIBITION IS A GREATER THREAT TO COMMUNITY HEALTH THAN THE
CONTROLLED AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS</B>
<P>
Most drug related deaths are a direct consequence of prohibition.
 Drug related deaths are not caused by the pharmacological properties
of these drugs rather, death is usually the result of accidental
overdose due to uncertainty about the purity. The second most
common cause of death is due to contaminants.  In both cases,
prohibition accords these drugs an illegal status which removes
any control over their production and restricts information regarding
safe dosage and the effects of their use.  
<P>
Prohibition is incompatible with public health strategies.  It
marginalises users, isolating them from treatment for addiction
and drug related illnesses for fear of prosecution.  It also restricts
their access to information about safe drug practices and the
transmission of  viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis.
<P>
Prohibition increases the cost of methadone and controlled availability
programs providing drugs.<BR>

<P>
<B>PROHIBITION REDUCES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS</B>
<P>
The very fact of the illegal status of some drugs makes them more
attractive to certain sections of the community.  This has the
potential to work against education programs.  
<P>
The arbitrary classification of some drugs as illegal and the
condoning of others such as alcohol and nicotine affects the credibility
of educational information on illicit drugs. It may be easier
to dismiss information on the harm caused by illicit drugs as
propaganda when it is viewed in the context of the greater social<B>
</B>and health problems caused by legal drugs such as alcohol.
<P>
The transition from prohibition to harm minimization will require
reform of existing drug laws and the redirection of resources
from law enforcement to strategies which provide the greatest
level of harm reduction for currently illicit drugs.  
<P>
The strategies required will be different for each type of drug
and will be determined by the modes of production distribution
and use associated with each.<BR>

<P>
In each case some reforms can be implemented immediately and others
will need to be implemented over time after education campaigns,
further research and monitoring of the reforms.  <BR>

<P>
<U><B>4.LEGAL &amp; PRESCRIPTION DRUGS</B></U>
<P>
It is noted that the current investigation conducted by the Premier's
Drug Advisory Council emphasizes the supply and use of illicit
drugs in Victoria.  It was established following extensive media
coverage of heroin trafficking in the Western Suburbs of Melbourne,
creating an impression that particular region was in the midst
of a &quot;Heroin Crisis&quot; or &quot;war&quot;.
<P>
Whilst social and criminal problems related to the abuse of illicit
substances continue to be of major concern, it is the experience
of Community Legal Centres and other community workers in the
western suburbs, that by far the most serious issues of substance
abuse relate to legal and prescription drugs.  It should also
be emphasized that the criminal and social problems related to
illicit substance abuse is very much a product of the system of
prohibition.  For this reason, this submission emphasizes alternative
models to prohibition.
<P>
Prescription drugs such as rohypnol, serapax and mogadon are cheap,
alternative substances to heroin.  The level of abuse of these
substances, whilst difficult to measure in objective terms, is
significant according to community workers in the western suburbs.
<P>
By far the most devastating drug in terms of criminal activity
and social dysfunction, remains to be alcohol.  Alcohol continues
to produce more social disruption and violent crime than illicit
substances.  Alcohol's pharmacology is such that alcohol intoxication
is often associated with uninhibited aggressive behavior - a major
reason why alcohol intoxication is a major factor in over 70%
of homicides.  By contrast, cannabis has a calming effect and
heroin is a pain killer which is most likely to aid sleep and
will not increase aggression. There is therefore a contradiction
in the status of alcohol (which is legal ) and some drugs which
are illicit but do not have such harmful results.
<P>
In terms of numbers of deaths caused by substance abuse each year,
in Australia, there are relatively few deaths - about 500 per
year - involving intravenous illegal drug use.  There have been
no deaths officially recorded as due to cannabis and there is
little evidence of morbidity due to cannabis use in Australia.
 By contrast, nicotine causes 18 000 deaths per year and alcohol
causes over 6 000 deaths per year.
<P>
Finally, the practice of &quot;chroming&quot; and the abuse of
other inhalants has in recent years become one of the more serious
substance abuse problems in the inner-city regions of Collingwood,
Richmond, Flemington, Kensington, North Melbourne and Carlton.
 Chroming means sniffing chrome based paint, by spraying the paint
from an aerosol can into a plastic bag, and then placing one's
face or entire head into the bag to inhale the vapors.  Other
inhalants that are commonly abused include glue, cleaning fluid,
felt tipped pens, correction fluid, petrol and gas from lighters.
 Unlike many other forms of substance use, the practice of chroming
and inhalant abuse is inherently dangerous, given the chemical
components of the substances involved, and cannot be practiced
without assuming a significant health risk.
<P>
The physical dangers of this form of substance abuse include loss
of physical fitness, permanent breathing problems, blindness,
asphyxiation, permanent kidney, liver and heart problems, brain
damage and damage to the central nervous system.  There have been
several deaths reported from chroming and inhalant abuse, both
immediately after inhalation, and also after long term abuse.
<P>
Chroming and inhalant abuse was given significant media attention
in May and June, 1995, in a similar manner to recent reports of
heroin abuse in the Western Suburbs.  The media reports emphasized
the escalating use in the practice amongst young people, mainly
aged between 14 and 16, with some users as young as 10.  Many
were of the opinion that the practice was popular because it was
a cheaper, accessible alternative to other drugs.
<P>
The only action taken to remedy the problem has been local community
initiatives ( such as the &quot;Footscray Drug and Safer Community
Forum Proceeding's Draft Report, 13th September,1995&quot; and
the St Kilda Project &quot;Harmonize To Minimize&quot;) to provide
education about the dangers of chroming, and to provide recreational
alternatives to young people in the area. Such existing initiatives
provide a plethora of ideas which should be evaluated and utilised
rather than reinventing the wheel.  There has been minimal government
funding or support to address the problem of chroming and other
forms of drug usage in the inner city regions of Melbourne. Further,
funding for support services, youth services, housing programs,
provisions of recreational options and areas of interest for youth
need to be dramatically increased rather than curtailed.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>5. WHAT WE CAN DO</B></U>
<P>
Drug Reform strategies must be neither simplistic nor half-hearted.
The drug problem is a serious problem particularly for today's
youth and those who are socially disadvantaged. It impacts on
the community at large and no measure of increase in police powers
or increase in sentences will truly tackle the drug issue at grass
roots level. As stated, such measures may actually exacerbate
the problems of illegal availability, going underground, crime,
the non-utilisation of health and other services for fear of prosecution
and consequent spread of HIV and Hepatitis. Today's youth as stated,
resort to drugs for a range of reasons. Adequate youth services,
support counselling and recreational opportunities need to be
facilitated and offered for the youth to give them options to
boredom and some substitute familial support if necessary.
<P>
It is for these reasons that the Federation of Community Legal
Centres calls on the Premier's Advisory Council to be brave, objective,
 creative and bold in its recommendations.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>END PROHIBITION</B></U>
<P>
 It is the Federation's view that the current laws in relation
to drugs need to be reviewed with a view to harm minimisation
rather than drug prohibition. Prohibition introduces the element
of fear and criminality into drug use which  forces its use underground
where it cannot be controlled and provides huge, untaxed profits
to a unscrupulous underworld. Deaths occur due to the impurity
of the available drugs. Our youth are enticed by  rebelliousness
to partake in something illegal, public funds are being allocated
to drug enforcement which could be redirected to effective harm
minimisation strategies and eventually to other areas of need
including crime prevention. Currently, a large proportion of prisoners
in this state are in prison due to drug related offenses. The
reality is that drug usage in prisons is widespread and so there
is an inherent contradiction in place. Research needs to be undertaken
into how to control the need for drug use amongst prisoners.
<P>
As at 31st August 1995 there were 365 doses of drugs administered
per day to women within Fairlea Prison of these 141 were psychotropic
drugs and 53 were analgesics (see &quot;Fairlea Women's Prison-
An Analysis of Time Spent Administering Medication&quot; )
<P>
As at the 16th August 1995 there were 125 women in custody in
Fairlea this equates to over one and a half mind altering drug
administrations per woman per day !
<P>
Whilst the management benefits to those in charge of the prison
are obvious if prisoners are highly doped on medications, the
cost in human terms is enormous. Their ability to function within
prison and to use their time in prison constructively, to participate
in education and other personal development programs is so enormously
reduced that their time spent in custody has greatly reduced benefits.

<P>
There is also the major problem that when women are released,
many do not know what drugs they have been taking or how to continue
to maintain the same levels of medication. The obvious choice
on release, is to revert to illicit drug use with many women tragically
overdosing within three months of release.
<P>
Deprivation of liberties is not the answer nor are intrusive practices
of search rather, a constructive study of the reasons why drug
usage is widespread in prisons is needed and alternative strategies
should be adopted. E.g. Recent disclosures about the Junee Prison
in NSW highlight the need for education to give hope, stimulation
and relieve boredom amongst prisoners. Further deprivation of
prisoner's rights in the fight against drugs is actually more
likely to lead to depression and a desire to take drugs to escape
their cruel world.
<P>
The profit incentive for the black market in drugs seems to continue
unaffected by current measures to curtail trade in drugs. With
the drug trade earning $300 Billion a year worldwide, second only
to the trade in arms, there is certainly an incentive for the
black market to continue with fearlessness, disregard for human
life and for pervading corruption. The corruption through exposure
to the drug underworld revealed by the Woods/Fitzgerald Royal
Commissions serves to undermine public confidence in our police
force and hence our security in the knowledge we will be adequately
protected.  To treat the drug problem as a &quot;war against drugs&quot;
is unrealistic and absurd as it paints the &quot;enemy&quot; as
drugs which are an inanimate object, rather than focus the issue
as one of removal of the profit incentive for illegal operators
and removing as far as possible risks to safety of the users and
community generally. <BR>

<P>
<U><B>6. ALTERNATIVE MODELS TO PROHIBITION</B></U>
<P>
It is strongly recommended that the Advisory Council explore existing
and proposed models which proffer alternatives to prohibition
as a means of addressing illicit substance abuse, together with
their related social problems.  Specifically, models which propose
a system of controlled supply of heroin should be investigated
and encouraged.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<U><B>HARM MINIMISATION</B></U>
<P>
Our submission proposes a harm minimisation strategy that would
be implemented in stages. Harm minimisation involves the protection
of both the users of drugs and the community at large. It seeks
to bring about a sense of responsibility, regulation and subsequently
more safety in the use of drugs. It requires political commitment,
one which was given in theory at the 1985 Premier's Conference
(after the acceptance of the National Drug Strategy which agreed
with harm minimisation) but has in reality not really seen the
light of day.
<P>
Harm minimisation will result in less associated crime arising
because the drugs are more readily available  and so the need
for theft, prostitution , burglary and other associated crime
is obviated. It will take away the major motivation of the black
market in the supply of drugs, namely profit and will also reduce
the temptation of corruption for officials. Harm minimisation
with its emphasis on responsible and safe use, combined with accurate
education and the provision of rehabilitation and counselling
for users would bring people's habits out in the open and provide
for information for further accurate research which to date has
been hindered by prohibition.
<P>
Objective policies and legal strategies need to be revised so
as to ensure controlled production, manufacture and distribution
of drugs of dependence and psychotropic substances. There is a
need for rigorous scientific trialing, controls on price and the
manner of consumption. Caution should be adopted when analysing
overseas experiences in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden
and the Netherlands as such experiences will often be effected
by the social and political contexts of each country and whether
there has been an effective evaluation of their outcome. This
is not to say that they should be disregarded as they provide
valuable information but they should be given due consideration.
<P>
Australia because it is a Federation of states has the ability
to enable different trials and innovative programs to occur which
suit the particular social and political context of each state.
Then, after evaluation the best possible approach could be adopted
nationally and lessons could be learnt about the difficulties
and strengths of each approach. This is what makes Australia and
Victoria a good venue to address drug reform constructively. The
Federation of Community Legal Centres advocates two stages. Each
would apply only to persons over eighteen years of age. Young
persons under eighteen found using would be educated and offered
the services of a counselor. Persons supplying people under the
age of eighteen would be subject to prosecution as with alcohol.
It is important to note that to treat users under the age of eighteen
as &quot;criminals&quot; exposes them to greater risk and so alternatives
to conviction need to be explored.
<P>
The Federation of Community Legal Centres believes that different
trialing of drug models should occur and be adequately supported.
Desired outcomes and objectives should be clearly articulated
at the outset of such trials. Trials should not just have a management
focus but also a therapeutic and harm minimisation focus. Evaluations
of pilots and trials should be done independently and be non partisan.
The most effective programs could then be adopted. All such trialing
should endeavor not to leave participants in the programs worse
off.<BR>

<P>
<B>STAGE 1</B>
<P>
The National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health of
the Australian National University, together with the Australian
Institute of Criminology have proposed a three stage heroin trial
treatment option for dependent heroin users.  The A.C.T. Heroin
Trial proposes to give people the choice of heroin and/or methadone
treatment programs, to determine if such an approach assists those
people who are not assisted by methadone alone.  In particular,
it seeks to ascertain whether such people are healthier, lead
a more stable life, stop committing crime and use less drugs.
 It will also seek to ascertain whether such a program is useful
in the long term, and whether this form of treatment will save
money for the community.
<P>
The trial involves two initial pilot studies in Canberra, which,
if shown to be worthwhile, will lead to a two year trial in Canberra
and two other cities.  The first pilot study is to be conducted
in Canberra and would involve 40 dependent heroin users chosen
from registered dependent users resident in the A.C.T. since 1993.
 The participants would be offered the choice of heroin and/or
methadone treatment programs.  The first pilot study would run
for 6 months at an estimated cost of $800 000.
<P>
Pilot Study 1 will be deemed a success if the following criteria
are met:
<P>
 * That a stable maintenance dose of injectable heroin or injectable
heroin plus oral  methadone is found for more than half of the
participants;
<P>
 * That injectable heroin maintenance treatment can be successfully
integrated with oral  methadone maintenance treatment;
<P>
 * That there are indications in improvements in at least half
of the participants in terms of  health, criminal behavior and
social functioning.<BR>

<P>
Should the first pilot study yield satisfactory results, the second
pilot study would then be implemented.  Again, this stage would
be conducted in Canberra, and would involve 250 dependent heroin
users, including the 40 from the first pilot study.  The 250 users
would be chosen from registered dependent users resident in the
A.C.T. since 1993.  Of those participating, 50% would receive
heroin or a combination of heroin and methadone treatment, and
50% would receive methadone treatment only, for the purposes of
comparison.  The second pilot study would also run for six months,
but at an estimated cost of $1.5 million.
<P>
Pilot Study 2 will be deemed a success if certain criteria are
met.  These include an indication that dependent heroin users
who had previously dropped out of methadone treatment are attracted
back to treatment, and that the retention rate for both this group
and for those recruited from current methadone clients is better
than for participants who receive oral methadone only.  Other
criteria include:
<P>
 * That a stable dose of injectable heroin or injectable heroin
plus oral methadone can be  found for more than half of the participants
in the group of users who are not on   methadone only.
<P>
 * That injectable heroin maintenance treatment can be integrated
successfully with oral  methadone maintenance treatment.
<P>
 * That at the end of six months, there are indications of improvements
in at least half of  the participants involved in heroin or heroin/methadone
treatment, in terms of health,  criminal behavior and social functioning.
<P>
The major trial would only be implemented should the second pilot
study yield satisfactory results.  The trial would be conducted
in Canberra and two other cities, with 1 000 dependent users in
total (i.e. 350 in each city, including those involved in the
second pilot study in Canberra).  It would target three groups
of dependent heroin users - those who have never been in treatment,
those who have dropped out of treatment, and current methadone
clients who would prefer the expanded treatment option.  Of those
participating in each city, 50% would receive heroin or a combination
of heroin/methadone treatment, and for the purposes of comparison,
50% would receive methadone only.  The trial would run for two
years.  As well as looking at the criteria for success for the
two pilot studies, the trial would specifically look at the ability
of the treatment to attract and retain in treatment those who
have never been in treatment, or those who have dropped out of
methadone only treatment, as well as improving retention rates
for those who previously had been involved in methadone only treatment
programs.
<P>
It is important to note that the trial also seeks to assess the
improvement in participants in terms of  health, criminal behavior
and social functioning.  It should be emphasized that in this
context, dependent heroin users' lifestyles, health and criminal
behavior may be improved by access to a regular, legal and safe
supply of heroin as part of their treatment program. The success
of the trial should not be assessed in terms of whether, over
time, the participants' heroin dependency is reduced or eradicated.
 For many, heroin dependency is an incurable illness, that requires
ongoing treatment and management.  For such people, the success
of the trial is indicated in terms of a reduction in criminal
behavior used to support a heroin dependency, improved health
by means of a safe, legal and monitored supply of heroin, and
generally a more stable lifestyle.
<P>
<B>Also, it is important that those participating in the pilot
studies and the trial are not left abandoned should a decision
be made to discontinue the program beyond the pilot study stage,
or to discontinue the trial.  </B>It is imperative that heroin
or heroin/methadone treatment continue to be available to those
who received it under the pilot studies and the trial.
<P>
The National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, together
with the Australian Institute of Criminology have called for extensive
financial support from outside the A.C.T. to fund the pilot studies,
given that these studies have extensive national significance.
 Accordingly, it is strongly recommended, given the groundwork
already undertaken in terms of this proposal, and given the current
concern of the Victorian Government to explore options for dealing
with heroin abuse in Victoria, that the Victorian Government provide
significant financial support to assist in the funding of the
pilot studies.  In addition, should the program progress to the
trial stage, it is recommended that the Victorian Government propose
that Melbourne be one of the two other cities in which the two
year heroin trial is conducted.
<P>
In addition, the Federation would recommend that immediate steps
be taken to legalise use, possession and personal cultivation
of cannabis. Self  administration should not be a criminal offense.
 Any harm is restricted to the user and abuse is more appropriately
treated as a health problem rather than a concern of the criminal
justice system.  Criminal sanctions should be abolished for the
possession of small quantities of cannabis<B> .</B>  In 1991,
it was found that 39,296 Australians were arrested on drug related
offenses in 1991. 83% of these arrests related to cannabis(Commonwealth
Department of Community Services and health(1990) Statistics on
Drug Abuse in Australia 1989 AGPS, Canberra). Convictions for
use invariably relied upon admissions made to police with the
consequent potential for abuse by law enforcement Commercial suppliers
could be licensed to supply marijuana to people aged 18 years
and over. agencies. The issuing of licenses for the production
and sale of cannabis would be accompanied by an education campaign
regarding the health effects of using cannabis. The operation
of licensed suppliers could be controlled to ensure compliance
with standards relating to cannabis production and the manufacture
of cannabis products. 
<P>
Licensed suppliers will also be required to provide consumer information
regarding the chemical constituents of products, usage and affects,
including appropriate health warnings. It would be illegal to
sell cannabis without a license and people infringing the law
will be subject to criminal sanctions similar to current penalties
for trafficking.   Cannabis is now widely used for pain management
particularly in the treatment of HIV related conditions.
<P>
1200 studies indicate that the side affects of cannabis use are
minimal when compared to prescription drugs or alcohol. Side effects
are usually confined to heavy users. (Hall. W, &quot;Health and
Psychological Consequences of Cannabis Use &quot;National Drug
Strategy monograph 25. No 15. National Campaign Against Drug Abuse).
The basis for legalization cannabis for persons over the age of
eighteen, as a first stage is because it is easier to set up controls
on its form of production by enabling personal use, possession
and cultivation in non trafficable quantities. Expiation notice
systems have been tried in South Australia and the ACT, these
do not really move away from the issue of responsible, and controlled
use but merely retain the criminal nature and from a court case
management point of view may be desirable but don't go towards
dealing with the complex issues outlined. We would recommend that
Victoria adopt a new approach and a decision then be taken as
to which works best.<BR>

<P>
<B>STAGE 2</B>
<P>
This stage involves the legalization of all drugs and provides
for their licensing, controlled manufacture and for clear, accurate,
detailed labeling of contents and amounts. Many drugs will need
preparation time to set up controlled modes of production and
so the Federation believes this level of legalization should be
staggered.  At the outset drug usage should not be assumed to
be an issue for the criminal justice system but only in a social
context (as for example is the current situation with alcohol).
Only when there is a problem with addiction should it become a
matter for the health fraternity(as is the case again with alcohol.
In tandem with use there would be accurate community education)
Closer liaison and education of the medical profession and the
pharmaceutical profession should be fostered in relation to services
available and their ethical responsibilities in the distribution
of all drugs and their responsibilities under a regulated system.
 
<P>
Recognition must exist as to different properties, methods of
intake, manner of use and chemical effects of different drugs
and further research into the best methods of regulating each
should occur. The method of intake of drugs is diverse and many
expose users to increased safety risk. This situation is encouraged
by prohibition. Legalization would make enable access to safer
methods of ingestion.<BR>

<P>
Stage 2 requires many controls and changes to be put into effect
before legalization can occur. Initially this may seem a daunting
proposal however, with drugs such as heroine(and other opioids),Cocaine
and Amphetamines that there are really serious and challenging
issues of infection, serious crime, loss of life and threat to
the community reside and such efforts are warranted. 
<P>
The best manner of licensing, manufacturing, distributing and
controlling the specific drugs should be investigated. It is conceded
that by legalizing cannabis only a small dent in the black market
trade in drugs will be made. It is also noted that some of the
profits made from cannabis trade are reinjected into the manufacture
of other drugs. So long as the hefty profits that can be made
from the use of these drugs exist, there will be an illicit and
uncontrollable trade which will proliferate and create an undesirable
and widespread underclass of users as exists in the United States
of America. 
<P>
In the United States there have been increases in police powers,
a reduction in personal liberties and a tendency to deal more
harshly with offenders. None of these features have proven effective
in dealing with the increasing drug problem in the States, if
anything the problem continues to become more widespread. 
<P>
Accordingly, the Federation of Community Legal Centres is of the
view that the issue of trafficking and use of drugs needs to be
tackled head on and with bravery. Therapeutic, harm minimisation
and crime prevention approaches must be embraced before our drug
problem escalates in the manner of the United States. 
<P>
At Legal Centres we find ourselves increasingly acting for youngsters
from a large variety of backgrounds, wealthy and poor, who feel
alienated and disassociated from the rest of the community-for
them drugs can provide a solace. It is the Federation's view that
prohibition serves to further alienate these people. To continue
blindly along the road of prohibition without a consideration
and commitment to the options available could well see Victoria
following the American example. It should be accepted that drugs
are an International dilemma and that Victoria given its population
size and commitment to resolution of the problem can adopt alternative
strategies.
<P>
The Government would monitor, control, and regulate the manufacture,
production and distribution of drugs through some form of an <B>independent</B>
Licensing Authority which would need to be well resourced (perhaps
the Federal government could make a commitment to contribute to
such an authority as the first move towards looking at a National
strategy). There would be a levy attached to drugs (as is the
case with tobacco and alcohol) which would reimburse the setting
up fees, provide resources for the other parts of the program
and the surplus would go into government revenue. 
<P>
Private organisations would apply for licenses, however, once
establishing their credentials and ability to manufacture according
to the requirements they would be subject also to the normal provisions
of the Trade Practices Act on misrepresentation, monopolies, price
fixing and pyramid selling (which is the current system with prohibition)
see diagram below: Further research is clearly needed on the logistics.
The Council is referred to the Redfern Legal Centre Model. The
Federation is of the view that such further research into the
establishment of regulations, controls and conditions for trade
(e.g. Where should outlets for drugs be?) Should be undertaken
with a view to resolving the drug problem and with a view to reducing
the devastating consequences of current drug use in relation to
crime, death, mental illness, and harm.
<P>
It is essential that the later stages of the Federation's drug
strategy be executed and not placed on the 'backburner' as being
too difficult. Before legalization a number of controls and regulatory
bodies will need to be established so as to monitor, license and
regulate the industry. Clearly there will be revenue from levies
imposed on the drugs. This would enable funding for resources
to put into education, rehabilitation and accurate information
forums. There may be some initial cost to government but there
would be scope for such amounts to be recouped. The following
areas will need organising:
<P>
Manufacture<BR>
Labeling<BR>
Licensing<BR>
Control<BR>
Rehabilitation<BR>
Counselling<BR>
Method of manufacture<BR>
Tools for using Drugs<BR>

<P>
<U><B>7.EDUCATION</B></U>
<P>
There is a difference between accurate education and propaganda.
The reality is that youth are perceptive and can often discern
the difference between the two. Propaganda will often be dismissed
by youth as exaggerated and will accordingly be ignored. There
is also a tendency to mystify drugs and thereby attract the rebellious
youths. If education is to be effective it needs to gain credibility
by being objective and accurate in order to be taken seriously.

<P>
The reality is that drugs are boring and this factor should be
acknowledged. Education should focus on safety and responsibility.
Many of these comments are not just limited to the education of
youth but to the community generally. There is currently some
good data which has been produced in Victorian schools in relation
to alcohol education which could be extended to gaining information
on attitudes to and use of drugs by youth. Care needs to be taken
in the design of curriculum and the manner in which such courses
will be evaluated and improved. Many of our youth however will
not have access to schools such as the homeless. Therefore education
programs that are accessible to these people must be implemented.
Peer education is often a good way of breaking down the barriers.
<P>
<U><B>8.REHABILITATION</B></U>
<P>
Drug users should be given the ability to access  such services
without fear of prosecution. Programs must be diverse so as to
provide a choice especially given the range of drugs and treatments
needed. There must be effective follow-up. Our observations with
many of our clients are that they are weaned off their drug of
addiction and then dropped. Some have died through overdose or
lack of attendant care. The re-establishment of the users dignity
should be inherent in any program given our earlier observations
about the low self esteem which often leads to drug usage. Needle
exchanges need to be established more widely around the states.
These should not be policed as this deters users from safe practices.
On talking with our clients many expressed the desire to use drugs
more safely and to even lose their addiction. They feel that in
the current climate of prohibition their fear of prosecution and
inability to access services(many expressed distress as their
centre had closed), makes it difficult.
<P>
<U><B>9.TREATIES</B></U>
<P>
Trials will be possible as they are for harm reduction and therapeutic
purposes under treaties. Australia needs to interpret its obligations
under these treaties more liberally than it currently does. Depending
on the success of our programs in Australia our commitments to
International Treaties may need reconsidering. It may well be
that successful programs in our own country may when adapted to
suit the overseas political and social contexts, be desirable
in other countries. It is crucial that all trials therefore have
specific objectives, clear desired outcomes, and effective, unbiased
evaluation techniques. Many of the strategies overseas, particularly
the English and Dutch models fall down in this regard.<BR>

<P>
<U><B>CONCLUSION</B></U>
<P>
The drug problem in Victoria can only be resolved by looking at
the problems from a holistic perspective. 
<P>
To perceive the drug problem as a law enforcement issue will never
lead to a constructive solution. Only an objective, non partisan
approach that looks at the issue of drug use in its social context
will provide the answers. There must be an ability to trial new
approaches to drug control as the current prohibitionist approach
is fraught with problems. Prohibition only sends the problem underground,
increases property crime,  violent crime and reduces access to
rehabilitation and medical services. Prohibition also promotes
unsafe practices.
<P>
Any genuine solution to resolving the drug problem requires a
dramatic increase in funding for services, the provision of accurate
and extensive education, more support for those who are distressed,
alienated or distressed, a number of options for rehabilitation
that are accessible. 
<P>
The Federation of Community Legal Centre's submission will be
considered a bold one but the problems involved for drug users
as we see it (on a daily basis in our work) requires some radical
and well planned and researched measures to be adopted. Otherwise,
we will find Victoria facing a higher crime rate, increased costs
involved in law enforcement ( rather than having money spent on
harm minimisation and crime prevention), extensive corruption
due to the profitability of the black market and an increase in
citizens who are alienated and disaffected. Increasing police
powers, curtailing peoples liberties, sending our youth to jail
where drug usage is widespread will only serve to exacerbate the
problems. Trialing new programs, evaluating them and implementing
the successful ones as indicated in our submission seems to be
the sensible way to go. <BR>
