<h3>Pinning Them Down</h3>
<p>

<h2>Checking up on the voting records of Congress is a
complicated business. What do they stand for?</h2>
<p>
<i>By Jenifer Simpson and William G. Stothers</i>
<p>

Things are not always what they seem. Except, perhaps, when they
seem confusing.
<p>
We set out to pull together the voting records of members of
Congress on disability issues in the 104th Congress.
<p>
It seemed like a straightforward task. What we found is a murky
swamp. Members of Congress have developed techniques for slipping
chameleon-like away from accountability for their actions.
<p>
It's like this:
<p>
A bill is proposed. It is pushed and pulled and pummelled in
subcommittee and committee before -- if ever -- it reaches the
floor of the House of Representatives or the Senate. The important
stuff may happen in subcommittee with or without a vote.
<p>
If the proposal makes it through committee and onto the floor, it
may never receive a straight up or down vote. Instead it may be
tacked on to some other bill as a "poison pill" or as a little
noticed side issue to some bigger issue.
<p>
Take Welfare Reform, for instance:
<p>
The Congress recently passed and President Clinton vowed to sign a
Welfare Reform Act. Everybody was hot to reform welfare. It was a
steamroller.
<p>
The "end of welfare as we know it" was proclaimed. Included in this
extravaganza were significant changes in Children's SSI.
<p>
What ended up in the final measure for Children's SSI, although
harmful to thousands of children, was significantly "better" then
the original proposal to block grant the funds at the level of 75
percent of last year's money to each state.
<p>
It would be foolish to say a Senator or Representative who voted
for welfare reform is against low-income children with disabilities
who receive SSI.
<p>
Do the compromises in the Children's SSI mean that a representative
voted the wrong way? Do we hold each legislator accountable for
every provision in every statute? Some say yes. At the least, we
should be asking a member why he or she voted for it and telling
them how many children will lose their benefits -- even if we
discern that it is election year politics and members can lose
their seats on the bigger issue.
<p>
What about the minimum wage?
<p>
There is not always agreement in our community as to what is a
"good" vote. For instance, a rise in the minimum wage may mean a
lot for low-income individuals with disabilities who work, but can
have a negative effect for individuals who hire personal assistants
for whom they will have to pay higher wages.
<p>
And Section 8...
<p>
Some people may feel that a vote for expansion of funds for Section
8 rental assistance for persons with disabilities is a "good"
indicator. Others may feel rental assistance in general is a market
distorting factor that works to keep housing stock out of the
housing market and works as a disincentive to a real increase in
the number of housing units. Others may say that any income support
program for persons with disabilities is good. Another person may
feel "welfare" is bad. How we agree on these fundamental principles
and how they are translated into legislation that affects a
particular individual means every person with a disability and
their family members must become even more informed and discerning
about issues. And we have to got to tell our representatives --
again, and again, and again -- how important issues such as
personal assistance services, Medicaid and health care, employment,
access to affordable housing and transportation are to us.
<p>
Go Vote!
<p>
In the August '96 issue of MAINSTREAM, the GO VOTE pullout section
described the issues of most importance for the disability
community, and suggested some pointed questions to ask members of
Congress and the people challenging them in this election. Get a
copy and press all the candidates strongly and persistently on our
issues.
<p>
Okay, given all the caveats above, here are a few Congressional
votes that show how Congress "works:"
<p>
CHILDREN'S SSI
<p>
How Representatives voted during initial 
welfare reform:
<p>
In January 1995, the U.S. House Ways & Means Committee Members
initially voted for welfare reform in subcommittee. At that time,
Section 402 of the welfare overhaul bill was a proposal to
drastically reform the Children's SSI program. Children's SSI
provides critical cash and Medicaid benefits to children with
disabilities in low income families. Section 402 gutted the current
federal cash benefit by proposing to remove the cash entitlement to
families, block grant 75 percent of the current total amount to
state bureaucracy and rip out the Individualized Functional
Assessment (IFA) process.
<p>
The IFA process permits children with multiple but mild
disabilities to be determined as disabled by SSA. The Senate later
looked at welfare reform, and senators modified the House proposal,
due to pressure from advocates for children with disabilities, so
that the cash entitlement was maintained. Nevertheless, the Senate
proposal for children's SSI reform revised the childhood definition
of disability to be used by the Social Security Administration and
completely removed the IFA process.
<p>
The recently passed welfare reform bill includes a version of
Children's SSI reform that is basically the Senate proposal,
despite another attack in May 1996 by the House Ways & Means
Subcommittee on Human Resources.  This critical vote follows.
<p>
104th CONGRESS <br>
House Ways & Means Subcommittee 
on Human Resources
<p>
Members who voted for Section 402 
(against the SSI cash entitlement for children with disabilities):
<p>
Rep. E. Clay Shaw, Chairman (R-FL), 
Rep. Mac Collins (R-GA), 
Rep. Jim McCrery (R-LA), 
Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), 
Rep. John Ensign (R-NV), 
Rep. Phil English (R-PA), 
Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-WA), 
Rep. Jim Nussle (R-IA).
<p>
Voting against this draconian proposal:
<p>
Rep. Pete Stark (D-CA), 
Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly (D-CT), 
Rep. Sander Levin (D-MI), 
Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-NY), 
Rep. Harold E. Ford, Ranking Member (D-TN).
<p>

MEDICAID
<p>
How Senators Voted on the 
Chafee Amendment:
<p>
Congress passed the Medicaid Transformation Act in December 1995,
which both removed the individual entitlement and set a cap to the
states on federal money for medical assistance and which permits
states to design their own medical assistance programs.
<p>
During the negotiations Senators Chafee (RI), Conrad (ND),
Rockefeller (WV), Frist (TN), Harkin (IA) and Wellstone (MN) pushed
through a critical amendment ("the Chafee amendment") favoring
persons with disabilities. This amendment would have required
states, in developing their plans for medical assistance under
proposed block granting, to include persons with disabilities to be
defined as those who are currently SSI eligible.
<p>
The Medicaid Transformation Act of 1995 was wrapped into an Omnibus
Reconciliation Act, which also included welfare reform. That act
was passed by Congress and then vetoed by President Clinton.
(Medicaid was not included in the welfare reform act passed in July
1996.)

<p>
WELFARE REFORM
<p>
President Clinton promised to sign the Welfare Reform Act passed in
July. In addition to many other provisions, this act terminates SSI
cash payments and food stamps for legal immigrants and potentially
will eliminate 300,000 children with disabilities from the SSI
rolls.
<p>
That will result from the repeal of the Individualized Function
Assessment process by which children with disabiliies were deemed
eligible for SSI based on their functional status in relation to
their chonologically aged peers.
<p>
The act also removes "maladative behaviour" from the list used to
establish whether a child has a medically determinable physical or
mental impairment of sufficient severity to qualify for SSI.
<p>
In addition, many children who now qualify for Medicaid based on
the SSI eligibility will not be able to re-establish their
eligibility for Medicaid on some other basis, and thus lose their
only means of health insurance coverage.
