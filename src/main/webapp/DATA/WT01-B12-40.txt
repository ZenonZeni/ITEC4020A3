 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HERBALS </H2>

<P>  Herbs  have  been  used  since  creation  to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter.  The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage.  Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies.  This is usually referred to in the literature today as phytotherapy.   We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits now.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge,  Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal based products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific nutritional goals.   These other synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants and, at times, concentrated tissue nutrients.   By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal based products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FLUID RETENTION</H2>
<P>  Consistent  use of DIUPLEX  may  result  in frequent elimination of water from the body. When the tissues retain too much water, it can create hydrostatic pressure that works against the blood vessels making it harder for efficient circulation to occur. This can cause elevated blood pressure and be an increased work load on the heart.</P>
<P>  For efficient weight loss to occur, the constant flushing of water from the body is necessary. Adepoise (fat) tissue retains water and its reduction naturally assists excess water elimination. This is a natural and beneficial cleansing action that can be supported by taking DIUPLEX while dieting.</P>
<P>  The kidneys do not actually eliminate water but they do eliminate sodium. When the sodium is transported by the kidneys, it is followed by water and thus diuresis occurs.</P>
<P>  However, because potassium is chemically very similar to sodium in certain ways, the kidneys sometimes perceive potassium to be sodium and it is eliminated instead of the sodium.  When excess potassium is eliminated, a feeling of tiredness is often experienced. Quite often, doctors prescribe high powered potassium salts to counteract this.  Then, they often discover that potassium products that are commonly used have a tendency to irritate the digestive tract and can actually go so far as to cause duodenal ulcers.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE DIUPLEX DIFFERENCE</H2>
<P>  The Life Plus DIUPLEX formula contains a small amount of potassium in each tablet. The small amount is not enough to cause any irritation to the intestines but it can help prevent possible depletion of potassium from the body due to the elimination of water. In addition, the potassium in DIUPLEX is in the form of a chelate, which is much more gentle on the digestive tract.</P>
<P>   A full 50 mg of Vitamin B-6 is included because of its natural diuretic effect when taken in this quantity. However, it should be taken with magnesium for best results.</P>
<P>  DIUPLEX also contains six different herbs including Buchu Leaves, Couch Grass, Corn Silk, Hydrangia Root, Uva Ursi and Peppermint. These herbs have been used for many years for their natural diuretic effect. This well liked product does not produce a strong "drug-like" effect that can be associated with unwanted side effects.  Instead, it provides a gentle, yet reliable diuretic effect.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  DIUPLEX is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty  natural  concentrates  of  numerous  valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE DIUPLEX</H2>
<P>  Since DIUPLEX is not a drug, but a natural product, some individuals need to take several tablets to notice its effect.  However, it is usually recommended that two to three tablets be taken in the morning and at mid-day. It is not wise to take it in the afternoon as its diuretic effect may carry over for several hours into the night, which could interfere with restful sleep.</P>

 <P>
 Suggested Use:  Two or three tablets, once or twice a day, in the morning, not after mid-day.</P>
