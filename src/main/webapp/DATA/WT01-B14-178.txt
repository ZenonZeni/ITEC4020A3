<H3><A NAME="A2">Origin of the Discussion Paper</A></H3>

       In October 1994, Industry Canada, in cooperation with the Information Highway
       Advisory Council, issued the discussion paper "Privacy and the Canadian Information
       Highway".  The paper was the first of several discussion documents to be released by
       Industry Canada on social, economic and technology policy issues.  Its purpose was
       to seek the public's views and to raise the level of debate on privacy issues related to
       the development and operation of the information highway. Written submissions
       and/or comments were invited on its contents, including the various options and
       approaches set out in the paper.  Submissions were to be received by December 23,
       1993.  Copies of the individual submissions are available for viewing, for a period of
       one year, at the Industry Canada Library, 2nd Floor, Journal Tower South, 365 Laurier
       Avenue West, Ottawa, Ontario, and at the regional offices of Industry Canada in
       Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver.

<H3><A NAME="A3">Responses Received</A></H3>

       The seventy-six responses received cover a wide spectrum of interests and expertise,
       and range in size from one page to sixty pages.  In order to simplify comparisons
       between them, the responses have been broken down into eight categories to reflect
       the main affiliation of the respondents.  These categories and the relevant number of
       responses in each are as follows: Medical and Social Research (21);
       Telecommunications and Technology(12); Individuals (11); Privacy and Consumer
       Advocates (11); Financial Services, Credit and Marketing Groups (5); Privacy
       Commissioners (4); Government (4); Miscellaneous (8).  The Miscellaneous category
       is comprised of a  labour organization, a standards organization, a
       telecommunications security company, a journalist, a writer/TV producer, an expert on
       learning and training, and two international respondents.  Summaries of the actual
       submissions, by category, are contained in Appendix A.

<H3><A NAME="A4">Basis of Review</A></H3>

       Each of the submissions is summarized in regard to general comments on privacy,
       privacy concerns and various methods of ensuring privacy.  Specific proposals and
       recommendations, stemming from the four main potential approaches set out in the
       Discussion Paper, are included in each summary, where applicable.  These various
       elements are brought together and summarized in the review itself, which includes
       conclusions resulting therefrom.

<H3><A NAME="A5">WHAT IS PRIVACY?</A></H3><HR>

<H3><A NAME="A6">Definition</A></H3>

<DL>
<DT>The right to privacy is defined in the Discussion Paper as comprising two elements:<P>
<DD>   the right to be left alone, free from intrusion and interruption; and,<P>
<DD>   the right to exercise control over one's personal information.
</DL><P>

       Both explicitly and by reference to examples, this definition is accepted by most
       respondents.  However in two cases, amendments to the definition are proposed.<P>

       In the first case, use of the word "interruption" is questioned by one of the technology
       associations as adding nothing to the concept of privacy because its use suggests
       that all interruptions - whether welcomed or not - are invasions of one's privacy. 
       Therefore, it submits that the concept of "uninvited" is the key to any notion of privacy
       intrusion in today's society.<P>

       The second comment comes from one of the consumer and privacy advocates.  In its
       view, the concept of privacy should be expanded to include the concept of
       "reputation" (as recognized by the Quebec Charter), in as much as personal
       information can shape what one thinks of someone.  Furthermore, it should also be
       expanded to include the concept of "dignity" (also recognized by the Quebec Charter),
       as it relates to one's "informational identity".

<H3><A NAME="A7">Who owns personal information?</A></H3>

       The question of who owns personal information is seen as elemental to privacy rights
       by some privacy and consumer advocates as well as by the Privacy Commissioner. 
       Their belief that personal information is owned by the individual is perceived as a
       fundamental premise underlying control over its collection, use, disclosure, retention
       and disposal.<P>

       Contrary to this view, most of the private sector organizations seem to be more of the
       view that personal information is a commodity over which the consumer should be
       able to effect varying degrees of control.  However, one technology association likens
       discussion about the ownership of transactional information as being similar to
       discussion about intellectual property.

<H3><A NAME="A8">Privacy - A Charter Right?</A></H3>

       A number of respondents, particularly privacy and consumer advocates, believe that
       the right to privacy should be incorporated in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
       The basis for this view is that privacy is a fundamental human right that must be
       recognized.<P>

       However, recognizing the difficulty of amending the Charter, an alternative proposal is
       that any amendment to the Privacy Act or any new federal privacy legislation should
       include a preamble that recognizes the principle of privacy.  This would be
       commensurate with a similar provision in the proposed privacy legislation of the European
       Communities.

<H3><A NAME="A9">WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY CONCERNS?</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="A10">Are there real privacy concerns?</A></H3>

       Confirming the generally accepted view, the vast majority of responses specifically
       point to a large and growing consumer concern over privacy matters, particularly in
       regard to the information highway.  There is little difference in views in this regard,
       whether they come from the private business sector, consumer and privacy
       advocates, privacy commissioners or individuals at large.  These concerns are shown
       to be evidenced by privacy surveys over the last few years and a number of these
       surveys are specifically quoted.<P>

       The Ekos survey "Privacy Revealed - the Canadian Privacy Survey" was conducted
       on behalf of a number of private and public sector organizations in 1992 and is the
       most oft quoted in the responses.  It showed that while 52 percent of Canadians are
       extremely concerned about privacy, 92 percent expressed at least moderate concern. 
       Moreover, 83 percent strongly believe that they should be asked for their permission
       before an organization can pass on information about them to another organization,
       and 71 percent totally agree that privacy rules should apply to both government and
       business.  Also, "there is a pervasive sense that  personal privacy is under siege from
       a range of technological, commercial and social threats".  Furthermore, greater
       concern was expressed about business sector organizations than about public sector
       organizations.  However, as pointed out by some business sector members, the
       survey also revealed that privacy is of more concern in the abstract.  Thus, while
       Canadians are concerned about controlling their personal information, they are more
       accepting of its use in specific situations where the purposes and benefits are clearly
       identified.<P>

       The 1992 "Equifax Canada Report on Consumers and Privacy in the Information Age" 
       also found that a strong majority of consumers are worried about threats to their
       privacy.  However, an equally strong majority agree that computers give people more
       convenient access to useful information and services and have improved the quality
       of life.  Moreover, the same majorities responded positively to the use of personal
       information in setting automobile rates, in approving loans, and in issuing a credit
       card or establishing credit limits.  The report concluded that 62 percent of "Canadians
       take a pragmatic approach to balancing privacy interests and access to valued
       consumer benefits, deciding area by area what kind of fair information practices, rules
       and protection are called for, and who should apply them".<P>

       In 1994, a poll done by Gallup Canada for Andersen Consulting on "What Canadians
       Think About the Information Highway" indicated that, while 67 percent of Canadians
       thought that the information highway was a good idea, 83 percent were very or
       somewhat concerned about how the highway might affect their privacy.  However,
       contrary to the views expressed in this survey, a 1993 Decima Research survey found
       that 70 percent of respondents thought that society is relying too much on technology
       and 61 percent thought that technology makes things more complicated instead of
       simpler.  In the 1994 TELUS Longwoods survey 39 percent of respondents felt that
       they would be so concerned about privacy invasions that they probably would not use
       the information highway.<P>

       These findings are reinforced and renewed by the fact that almost all of the
       comments received from individuals related to concerns about the protection of
       personal information and freedom from intrusion.<P>

       The extent of concerns is very broad, ranging across freedom from intrusion,
       protection of personal information, lack of knowledge and power, and technology.

<H3><A NAME="A11">Concerns re Freedom from Intrusion</A></H3>

       These concerns are related to the right to be left alone.  Although the Discussion
       Paper lays great emphasis on a discussion of the four approaches which might
       alleviate privacy concerns related to the protection of personal information,
       considerable concern is also expressed by respondents on the issue of uninvited
       intrusion.  These concerns are equally expressed by both the business sector and the
       consumer sector, and may be divided into two broad areas.  The first area involves
       monitoring and surveillance and the second involves unwanted or annoying intrusions
       into a person's time.<P>

       Monitoring and surveillance is seen to be by far the most annoying and potentially
       damaging intrusion and many examples are given.  A typical example is the
       "electronic leash" created by the enhanced tracking capabilities inherent in wireless or
       satellite-based personal communications systems whereby, in the absence of
       effective controls, the actual location and movements of an individual can be tracked
       in an unauthorized manner.  Also, the "data shadow" cast by an individual in a series
       of transactions on the information highway, can be assembled into a pattern which
       will allow a profile to be developed of an individual's lifestyle, personal habits, and
       buying power and preferences.  Employee monitoring, whether by video surveillance
       or electronic productivity monitoring, is also seen as a significant issue. Surveillance
       of E-mail, whether by employers or outside sources, is both a concern and, in regard
       to employer monitoring, has caused an active debate as to whether the employer has
       the right to monitor personal messages sent by E-mail.  A most vociferous concern re
       surveillance and monitoring relates to the use of scanners to intercept cellular or other
       radio-based private communications.  This concern is expressed both by the
       consumer sector and the telecommunications sector, as is the recent issue over call
       blocking of name display telephone services.  Finally, surveillance at home is also
       seen as a potential problem in the light of proposed systems which will allow the
       provision of security services by electronic means, electronic monitoring of
       consumption and service by utility companies, and interactive multimedia services on
       TV and home computer systems.  Nevertheless, surveillance and monitoring are not
       seen as totally negative.  Their significant benefits are recognized in the fields of
       home security, search and rescue, commercial fleet management, etc.  It is all a
       question of the uses to which monitoring and surveillance are put.<P>

       Unwanted or uninvited intrusions into a person's time are also seen as a concern but,
       as evidenced by responses to polls and from respondents, not to the same degree as
       monitoring and surveillance.  While the former is seen as an annoyance, the latter is
       seen as potentiality threatening. However, telemarketing is deemed to be more of an
       intrusion than ad-mail, although the recent CRTC decision banning the use of
       automatic dialing-announcing devices (ADADs) for commercial solicitation and
       restricting the hours during which "live" telemarketing can occur should do much to
       alleviate the problem.  In any event, the consumer usually has the ability to terminate
       the intrusion at will.

<A NAME="A12">Concerns re Protection of Personal Information</A>

       A perceived inability to control access to and the use by others of an individual's
       personal information is seen as the major privacy concern.  Allied to this is the
       unauthorized marketing of personal information.  These concerns are equally
       recognized by business organizations, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy
       commissioners.  It is also the concern most frequently expressed  by individuals.<P>

       The unauthorized use of transactional data and the compilation of personal profiles by
       the matching and linking of personal information are significant issues.  Whether they
       take place as a result of involvement in credit card, direct marketing or banking
       transactions, etc., or as a result of obtaining medical services, all are seen as being
       major areas of concern.<P>

       Lack of adequate security and protective measures is also worrisome.  This can be
       due to lack of knowledge or laxity on the part of employees of the organization holding
       the personal information or to lack of built-in or established security/protective
       measures.<P>

       A number of specific issues related to particular types of personal information are also
       evident.  Of these, use of the Social Insurance Number (SIN) and the protection of
       medical and health information are the most important.  Lack of control on the use of
       the SIN by both the private sector and by those elements of the public sector which
       do not have specific authorization for its use are seen as a concern in a number of
       responses from individuals.  Also, the protection of medical and health information
       related to individuals is seen as particularly sensitive.  Concerns in this latter regard
       come not only from individuals, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy
       commissioners but also from the private sector and the medical research community. <P>

       Another area of general concern is the issue of cross-border transfers of personal
       information.  Here, the worry is that personal information will no longer be subject to
       national or provincial jurisdiction and therefore may not be capable of being protected.<P>

       Seemingly contrary to these concerns, is the concern that the business, economic
       and social benefits of the collection and use of personal information must be
       recognized.  Business benefits are expressed in terms of the extension of markets
       and the ability to provide new and better services.  Economic benefits are seen as the
       ability to provide additional employment in such areas as the direct marketing
       industry, while social benefits are seen to include law enforcement, medical and
       social research as well as the ability to implement consumers transactions in a more
       effective, efficient and less costly manner.  Not only is this concern expressed by the
       business community and medical and social researchers, but the benefits also are
       recognized by consumer and privacy advocates as well as privacy commissioners. <P>

       Two journalist/writers express fears that privacy initiatives could restrict access to
       large numbers of records, even though anonymized.  This could prejudice the
       freedom of expression provisions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Some
       private sector organizations are concerned that network providers may be seen as the
       information highway's privacy police.  In this regard, a number of respondents agree
       that this would be an impossible task and that privacy measures should focus on the
       information providers who interact on the highway.  Also, there is concern that it
       should be recognized that consumers also have a responsibility in the protection of
       their own privacy.<P>

       On the matter of privacy in general, a few respondents have noted the strange
       ambivalence that occurs within the general public.  While supporting the need for the
       adoption of strong privacy principles, particularly when they themselves are directly
       affected, many are not so concerned when their fellow citizens are affected. This is
       expressed in the call for information about the whereabouts of convicted criminals
       who have served their sentences, e.g. rapists and child molesters, the hunger for
       details of the personal lives of public figures as published in the tabloids, and the
       support for using new technologies to root out fraud and abuse, eliminate waste and
       duplication, and streamline inefficient bureaucratic procedures.

<H3><A NAME="A13">Concerns re Technology</A></H3>

       The continuing and rapid evolution of technology, coupled with the benefits it can
       bring, raise a concern that privacy could become the victim of creeping erosion.  It is
       not so much the actual applications of technology that cause the greatest concern but
       the fact that privacy may be left behind or overlooked in the "onslaught of technology". 
       Coupled with this, is the equal concern that privacy safeguards are too often not
       "built-in" to the development of technology but are "bolted-on" as a  later and perhaps
       ineffective appendage.<P>

       In spite of these concerns, it is acknowledged that there is a growing public
       acceptance of the use of technology.  This is illustrated by the use of automated
       banking machines (ABMs), the Interac direct payment service, personal computers,
       modems, the Internet, electronic tax filing, etc.<P>

       However, a contrary concern, particularly on the side of the business sector, is that
       privacy concerns or requirements may inhibit the development of new and innovative
       technologies.  Therefore, they see a fair balance as being required between the
       demands of technology development and privacy protection requirements.

<H3><A NAME="A14">Concerns Based on Lack of Knowledge and Power</A></H3>

       Some of the foregoing concerns can be partially attributed to a perceived lack of
       knowledge and power on the part of consumers.  Individuals become frustrated
       because they are not aware of exactly what technology can do and therefore may
       have little understanding of the privacy implications that may be involved.  Equally,
       they feel powerless in many circumstances, particularly because they do not see any
       effective means of redress for privacy related complaints against the private sector.<P>

       Specific concerns in this area relate to the fact that very often individuals have
       absolutely no knowledge of just who might hold information about them.  Moreover,
       they feel vulnerable because of the well publicized cases where privacy infractions or
       problems have not come to light until well after the fact.

<H3><A NAME="A15">Medical and Social Research</A></H3>

       By far the greatest volume of responses to the Discussion Paper came from the
       medical and social research community.  While fully endorsing the need for protection
       of personal information, almost unanimous concern is expressed about the potentially
       negative effect of proposed protection measures on medical and social research.<P>

       The types of research involved include studies on the continuity and effectiveness of
       health services, the use of multiple prescription drugs by the elderly, the incidence of
       serious and fatal diseases such as cancer and heart disease, the outcomes of
       therapeutic procedures and drugs, environmental effects on health, how families and
       individuals respond to the changing social and economic environment, etc.  This
       research has important public benefits related to the improvement of health in the
       community and the ability to make effective decisions in the health and social policy
       fields.<P>

       The actual concern revolves around the fact that if Canada adopts identical principles
       to those included in the draft EC privacy directives it is believed that the ability to carry
       out essential research in the public interest could be stifled. The reason is that no
       exemptions are provided in the EC directives regarding prior consent to the collection
       and use of personal information, and for the retention of personal information only for
       as long as it is required for its initial purpose.  Therefore, the prohibition of long term
       storage would make it impossible to track case histories over a lifetime, and the need
       to obtain consent would present prohibitive logistical and cost barriers.<P>

       The submissions from the medical research community provide great detail on the
       security measures taken to protect personal information.  These include:
       anonymization of personal data by the use of scrambling techniques; locked research
       areas; computer security systems; oaths of secrecy; approval and enforcement of
       project protocols by university and provincial bodies; structural separation of research
       from administrative functions; etc.  Also, none of the respondents is aware of
       confidentiality ever having been breached.  Moreover, the focus is not on individual
       patients but on groups or populations of patients.  Therefore, they consider that there
       is no justification for applying the same restrictions concerning consent, use and
       retention of data held for research purposes as is proposed for data held for other
       purposes in the public and private sectors.  As one researcher put it " Are we
       inventing a cure for which there is no disease?".<P>

       In overall terms, there is a strong belief, expressed by many respondents from all
       sectors, that if the various concerns of the general public are not alleviated, the 
       information highway will not be used to its full potential.

<H3><A NAME="A16">HOW TO ENSURE PRIVACY?</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="A17">The Canadian Experience</A></H3>

       Some of the submissions touch on the Canadian experience with privacy legislation,
       regulations and voluntary codes, by way of background to the current situation.<P>

       Only six jurisdictions are shown to have effective privacy legislation covering the
       public sector, i.e. the Federal Government, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan
       and British Columbia.  Whereas, only Quebec has legislation governing the private
       sector.  Other federal legislation also has provisions related to privacy.  The
       Telecommunications Act has provisions to protect the privacy of individuals, including
       the regulation of unsolicited communications.  Also, amendments to the Criminal
       Code and the Radiocommunication Act now forbid the divulgence of intercepted
       radio-based telephone communications.  Furthermore, the new Bank Act, Insurance
       Companies Act and Trust and Loan Companies Act permit regulations to be made
       governing the use of information provided by customers.  In addition, all English
       speaking provinces, with the exception of New Brunswick and Alberta, have some
       form of legislation protecting consumer credit information.<P>

       At the federal level, there is very little protection of privacy by formal regulations. 
       Recent decisions of the CRTC have restricted the use of ADADs and limited the use
       of junk facsimiles and live voice calls for solicitation purposes.  In addition, it has
       prohibited the use of pre-recorded or computerized calls for solicitation purposes and
       has made clear that telephone companies can, on two days notice, cancel the service
       of ADAD users who violate this provision.  In approving "name display service", it has
       also directed telephone companies to provide free per-call blocking of the display on a
       universal basis.  Finally, it has indicated that it will not grant speedy approval to
       competitive filings of telephone companies if those filings raise privacy concerns. 
       Under the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act and Trust and Loan Companies no
       regulations have as yet been established in regard to the use of customer information.<P>

       In the private sector, a number of industry associations and businesses have
       instituted voluntary privacy codes.  In the telecommunications industry, the then
       Minister of Communications issued a set of six "Telecommunications Privacy
       Principles" in 1992.  They were to be implemented by a Telecommunications Privacy
       Protection Agency made up of  representatives of industry and consumer groups.
       However the Agency never got of the ground for a number of political, economic and
       practical reasons.  The Canadian Direct Marketing Association (CDMA), the Canadian
       Bankers Association, and Stentor have all issued privacy codes for their members. 
       The cable industry also has embedded privacy principles within a general set of
       industry standards that is administered by the independent Canadian Cable Television
       Standards Council.  In addition, a number of individual companies have developed
       there own voluntary privacy codes.<P>

       In summary, however, in spite of the considerable effort put in to these initiatives,
       many respondents see this as a patchwork approach which is confusing and difficult
       to understand by the average individual.  Nor will this approach address emerging
       international standards, the dangers of rapidly evolving technologies, or the
       expectations of the public.

<H3><A NAME="A18">International Experiences</A></H3>

       Many respondents see international experiences as being the root from which
       Canadian privacy endeavours have grown and as a model upon which future
       endeavours can be based.<P>

       In the 1970s many European countries had adopted privacy legislation which often
       was incompatible among the various countries.  Accordingly, the OECD issued a set
       of guidelines in 1982 on the "Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal
       Information" for adoption by its members.  These guidelines which established basic
       privacy principles, also provided for restriction on the transborder flow of personal
       information to countries which did not comply with equivalent privacy protection
       principles.  Much of the public sector privacy legislation in Canada is based on the
       principles in the OECD guidelines.  However, although Canada acceded to the
       guidelines in 1984, the effect of the restriction of transborder data flow provisions has
       been negligible because of their voluntary nature.  Subsequently, in 1990, the EC
       drafted privacy directives on the "Protection of Individuals in Relation to the
       Processing of Personal Data", which are aimed at harmonizing all European data
       protection legislation to offer common and high levels of protection in order to
       facilitate trade.  The directives will have the force of law if passed by the European
       Parliament.  The latest draft of the directives, which build on the OECD guidelines
       and principles, take into account practical difficulties experienced with the OECD
       guidelines and somewhat reduce the rigidity of the earlier provisions.  Thus, 
       transborder data flows are allowed to countries which have adequate, rather than
       equivalent, data protection measures.  More importantly, they provide for the
       protection of personal privacy as a basic human right, cover both the public and
       private sectors and apply to both automated and manual records.<P>

       Since the 1970s the United States has, at the federal level, passed various pieces of
       privacy related legislation ranging from a general Privacy Act to sectoral specific
       legislation covering such areas as credit reporting, computer fraud and privacy in
       electronic communications.  However, none of this legislation covers the protection of
       personal information across the whole of the private sector.  Indeed, in 1977 the
       Privacy Protection Study Commission explicitly rejected an omnibus private sector
       data protection law on the European model.  It favoured  a combination of legislation
       and non-statutory codes that would be sector specific and thereby more sensitive to
       the different information-handling practices and the needs of different industries. 
       Moreover, the US legislation has neither oversight provisions nor data protection
       boards or privacy protection commissions.  More recently, however, new studies have
       commenced in the USA in regard to privacy on the information highway.  Similar to
       this current study by the Advisory Council, they are being undertaken by the National
       Information Infrastructure (NII) Privacy Working Group, and the National
       Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).  New draft general
       privacy principles have been developed by the NII and a discussion paper has been
       issued by the NTIA for comment.  In addition, new Telecommunications Bills before
       Congress also deal with telecommunications-related privacy concerns.<P>

       A number of respondents also favourably review privacy experiences in other
       countries such as Holland, Great Britain, New Zealand, Hong Kong, etc.

<H3><A NAME="A19">Privacy Principles</A></H3>

       The response to the Discussions Paper's request for comments on the principles that
       should form the basis of effective privacy protection has been met by a wide range of
       responses.  Therefore, the specific responses are included, where applicable, in each
       of the summaries of submissions received, as set out in Appendix A.   However,
       some common threads are discernible.<P>

       Basic to the arguments of some privacy and consumer advocates and privacy
       commissioners is the premise that the right to privacy is a fundamental human right.
       Stemming from this, is the view that privacy is too important to be left to the whims of
       the marketplace and therefore privacy protection should be seen as an integral  and
       necessary part of doing business.<P>

       The ability of individuals to control their personal information is perhaps seen as the
       major privacy issue.  Such control extends to collection, subject to statutory
       requirements, as well as to use and disclosure in accordance with fair information
       practices.<P>

       An essential element of control is the question of consent.  However, this has
       different interpretations in different sectors.  Generally, the consumer and privacy
       advocates and privacy commissioners see this as "informed consent".  This is
       interpreted to mean a clear understanding of the reasons for the collection of
       information and the uses to which it will be put, and being free from any form of
       "coercion".  Many in the business sector also appear to subscribe to the concept of
       "informed consent" while not defining it in that manner.  Whereas others tend to see
       consent as being deemed to have been given by the entry into a transaction.  Also,
       whereas privacy and consumer advocates and privacy commissioners see consent as
       being given by "opting-in", the business sector prefers the concept of "opting-out".<P>

       Other principles, based in large measure on the OECD guidelines and the provisions
       of the federal Privacy Act, include: identification of the purposes of collection; limiting
       collection to information which is necessary for those purposes; ensuring that
       personal information is as accurate and up to date as is necessary for those
       purposes; allowing access by individuals to their personal information, including
       correction where necessary; and, providing mechanisms for complaints and redress.<P>

       Some additional principles have arisen in recent years due to advances in technology
       and the changing marketplace.  These include the requirement for the protection of
       personal information by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the
       information, and the principle that individuals should not have to pay to maintain basic
       and existing levels of privacy.  Related to this latter aspect, there are some
       differences of viewpoint.  Some maintain that consumers should pay for enhanced
       privacy above the basic level, whereas others maintain that privacy should not be
       prejudiced by inability to pay.  Another principle entails freedom of individuals to
       choose whether or not to connect to the information infrastructure, to accept or reject
       services that may affect their level of privacy, and to be free to subscribe to, and be
       charged for, only those services they wish to receive.  However, they should not
       suffer reduced levels of service because of their choice.<P>

       In overall terms, there are not significant differences in views relating to privacy
       principles between, on the one hand consumer and privacy advocates and privacy
       commissioners, and on the other hand the business sector.  Both groups show strong
       support for the privacy principles included in the CSA draft model code which are, in
       the main, equivalent to those set out above.<P>

       Some of the submissions also advance principles that should govern the
       development of the information highway, particularly as it relates to privacy issues. 
       These include the principle that privacy measures must be compatible with the
       dynamic and often unpredictable evolution of the highway, and that the protection of
       privacy on the highway must be balanced with the rights of creators to know who is
       using their intellectual property.

<H3><A NAME="A20">The Public and Private Sectors</A></H3>

       Some of the consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners see a
       relatively new and emerging problem in relation to privacy on the information highway. 
       This is seen as a blurring of the distinction between information which is resident in
       the public sector and that which is resident in the private sector.  Therefore,
       contracting-out of more and more public functions to the private sector is expected to
       have an increasing effect on the privacy practices of the private sector.  As personal
       information in the public sector is passed to the private sector for the fulfillment of
       these contracts, the public sector will no doubt ensure that its privacy protection
       obligations are made part of those contracts.  In addition, the increasing matching of
       public sector information with private sector information, such as the matching of data
       on welfare recipients with bank or financial information to ascertain eligibility, also are
       seen to narrow the gap.  Likewise, in an evolutionary sense, the continued efforts of
       privacy commissioners and the press in bringing privacy issues to the fore will also
       have a spillover effect.  In fact, one international respondent believes that the
       abandonment of the distinction between the public and private sector in the latest
       draft of the proposed EC privacy directives reflects the fact that the increasing flows
       of personal information between those sectors renders the distinction irrelevant.<P>

       Within the private sector alone, further blurring is seen between the individual
       industries using the information highway.  Because of integration of the various media
       and technologies in a "seamless web", the former clear distinction between telephone
       companies, cable companies, broadcasters, the press, marketers, etc., is increasingly
       ceasing to exist.  This leads to difficulty in determining where one sector ceases and
       another commences.  Therefore, a potential problem is seen in establishing privacy
       protection on a purely sectoral basis.

<H3><A NAME="A21">A Level Playing Field</A></H3>

       Reference has been made earlier to the patchwork of federal /provincial legislation
       and regulations, as well as the multitude of different private sector codes across both
       Canada and all sectors of the marketplace.  This results in concerns arising in both
       private sector groups and the consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy
       commissioner groups.  The problem seen by some members of all of these groups is
       that if a national privacy standard is not established across Canada, privacy inequities
       will continue to occur between different individuals, based on both their respective
       geographical location and the respective business organizations with which they do
       business.  Moreover, some business organizations may be able to achieve
       discriminatory and unfair marketing advantages.  Failure to create a level playing field
       could possibly lead to the creation of "data havens," whereby the most lenient
       jurisdictions may attract businesses that seek to evade privacy protection measures 
       Also, artificial legal distinctions would have to be made about where data is "located"
       when it travels the highway.

<H3><A NAME="A22">Legislation and Regulation</A></H3>

       By far the greatest debate and difference in views occurs in regard to whether the
       preferred approach to privacy protection rests with legislation and regulation or with
       voluntary codes and standards.  Each of these views has its supporters and
       detractors for a wide variety of quite valid reasons.<P>

       The majority of respondents who addressed this issue believe that the government
       needs to take stronger action to protect the privacy and security of information. While
       acknowledging the differences in federal/provincial jurisdictions and the difficulty of
       harmonizing approaches between them, most of the respondents who seek stronger
       measures believe that additional legislation and regulation, covering both the public
       and private sectors, is essential.  In addition, the 1992 Ekos privacy survey revealed
       that "compared to a model of pure voluntary self-regulation by business, Canadians
       strongly prefer a governmental legislative response".<P>

       The reasons why legislation and regulation are seen to be required cover a wide
       range.  It is perceived to be the only way to establish a level playing field across
       Canada and to guarantee an adequate level of privacy protection for the public, free
       of confusion and regional and sectoral inequities.  Moreover, there is a risk that
       transborder flows of data could be prejudiced if privacy protection measures are not
       deemed to be adequate under the proposed EC privacy directives.  National
       legislation and standards would meet this requirement.  Furthermore, equal legislated
       national privacy standards for both the public and private sectors would do much to
       negate the concern related to the blurring of the distinction between information which
       is resident in the public sector and that which is resident in the private sector.  As one
       consumer advocate indicated, there has been enough discussion and evidence of the
       inadequacy of voluntary codes over the last ten years that the government must act
       now and be seen to take a leadership role.  Reinforcing this view, is the observation
       that Canada is one of the few western type democracies that does not have
       legislation covering both the public and private sectors.<P>

       The manner in which legislation and regulation can be implemented also covers a
       wide spectrum.  Starting with the public sector, there are suggestions that the
       government should "clean up its own shop".  As a start, there should be amendments
       to the Privacy Act.  A preamble to the Act would clearly establish the principle that
       privacy is a fundamental right (this is also seen as a requirement in any additional
       legislation governing the private sector).  There should be a  provision for the
       protection and security of personal information.  The undertaking of privacy impact
       assessments as part of the design process of all new or major revisions to
       government systems and programs would become mandatory.  Finally, a process
       would be established whereby a standing parliamentary committee would hold
       hearings on the Privacy Commissioner's Annual Report and the annual reports of
       government departments, similar to the manner in which the Public Accounts
       Committee reviews the Auditor General's Report and the public accounts of individual
       departments.  In addition, a number of respondents call for the government, in
       assuming a leadership role, to legislate privacy requirements on organizations that fall
       within the federally regulated private sector and to take all other means within its
       control that would promote the adoption of privacy measures by the private sector.
       In regard to legislating privacy in the private sector, supporters of the proposal tend to
       favour the establishment, by legislation, of a national framework of privacy standards
       under which private sector codes would operate and be bound.  This would be
       complemented by an independent and impartial administrative mechanism which
       would enforce compliance, hear complaints, provide redress and deliver sanctions.  A
       number suggest that such a system could be based on the Quebec Act Respecting
       the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector which is the only privacy
       legislation governing the private sector in Canada.  However, such a view is not
       unanimous.  One private sector institution believes that the Quebec Act does not
       achieve a balance between the protection of privacy and the free circulation of
       information which is so necessary in a market economy.  However, another indicated
       that the Act had had little impact on its policies and procedures although it was
       viewed as "overkill" in some respects.   It is also recognized that such legislation
       would have to be both framed and implemented in the most non-bureaucratic and
       cost-effective manner possible.  This view is reinforced by one British respondent who
       states that the data registration provisions of the UK Data Protection Act are largely
       ignored because they are too bureaucratic and fairly meaningless.  Also, it is
       suggested that any legislation should have a phase-in period in order to avoid
       economic upheaval in areas such as the direct marketing industry which employs
       thousands of Canadians.  Other suggestions for such legislation include provision for
       "whistle blowing" against organizations engaged in illegal activities, and the
       recognition of joint culpability on the part of both senders and receivers.  Furthermore,
       the government is urged to quickly enter into discussions with the provinces with a
       view to harmonizing both public and private sector legislation across Canada.<P>

       Opponents of legislation and regulation see a number of problems in taking the
       legislative route.  Legislation is seen as too blunt an instrument which would be
       inflexible and be incapable of reacting to the accelerating changes and needs of both
       technology and the marketplace.  Moreover, it is also seen as being capable of
       inhibiting new initiatives and prejudicing investment in these areas.  In this regard, the
       fact that business requirements and technologies differ from one sector to another
       would only compound the problem.  The time it would take to secure agreement
       between the federal and provincial jurisdictions also is considered to be a major factor
       against legislation.  Furthermore, some believe that voluntary codes and standards
       are only in their infancy and have not yet been given a chance to prove themselves,
       therefore legislation should only be used as a last resort.  Legislation and regulation
       also are seen as going against the current trend to deregulation in the global
       marketplace, as requiring additional public funding in a time of fiscal restraint, and as
       possibly leading to "micro-management" of the marketplace.<P>

       In general terms, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners favour
       legislation, whereas the private sector is against it.  However the picture is not
       completely black and white. One technology association supports legislation in order
       to guarantee consistent and appropriate levels of privacy protection.  Whereas, a
       telecommunications company believes that the regulated telecommunications industry
       should be exempted from any future legislation because it is already governed by the
       privacy provisions of the Telecommunications Act.  Other private sector organizations
       would not be against legislation if it was shown, after a reasonable period of time, that
       voluntary codes and standards were not working, provided that it recognized
       marketplace realities.<P>

       However, the radio-telecommunications industry is strongly in favour of technology-
       specific legislation.  It believes that the government should move quickly to pass
       legislation to make it an offence to intercept radio-based telecommunications and to
       generally prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale and distribution of scanners
       capable of monitoring radio-based telephones, including cellular phones.<P>

       In regard to the question as to whether adequate privacy protection can be provided
       through provincial or sectoral legislation, there are somewhat conflicting views. 
       However, there seems to be general acceptance that such a course would not be
       sufficient by itself.  Strong opponents of legislation are opposed to it whether it be
       federal, provincial or sectoral, while others agree that, if legislation is to be enacted, it
       must be based on national standards in order to ensure a "level playing field. There is
       equal concern about "balkanization" occurring coupled with the establishment of "data
       havens".  In summary, in any move towards legislation, discussions and coordination
       with the provinces are considered to be essential.

<H3><A NAME="A23">Voluntary Codes and Standards</A></H3>

       The main benefits of voluntary codes and standards are seen to be their flexibility and
       adaptability.  It is pointed out that different sectors are engaged in different business
       practices and utilize different technologies.  Therefore, flexibility allows them to
       customize their privacy practices to the specific nature of the business and to the
       needs of their customers.  Also, they can more quickly adapt and be more sensitive to
       changes in business practices, as well as to evolving technology and consumer
       privacy concerns.  Moreover, regular reviews can be undertaken to assess the effects
       of changing circumstances.  Voluntary codes also can be national in scope, providing
       a level playing field across individual sectors, thus avoiding the problems of different
       federal/provincial jurisdictions.  Additional advantages are also linked to the fact that
       they can be less costly to operate and responsibility and costs can be focused within
       the organization.  Furthermore, they can raise the profile of privacy within an
       organization and help to educate the public, thereby building the confidence of
       consumers while allowing them to fully participate in the benefits of the information
       highway.<P>

       Voluntary codes and standards can be implemented in many ways, each tailored to
       the particular needs of a sector.  They can be made mandatory on the members of a
       given sectoral association, as with the Canadian Direct Marketing Association code,
       or they can be incorporated in the confidentiality Terms of Service approved by the
       CRTC, as with the regulated carriers governed by the Telecommunications Act.  In
       addition, the adoption and implementation of voluntary codes can be made necessary
       by peer pressure, compelling competitive interests and consumer demand, whereby
       consumers will "vote with their feet" if they are not satisfied that their privacy concerns
       are being met.<P>

       One of the most significant developments in voluntary codes at the present time is
       seen as the CSA draft model privacy code which is strongly supported not only by the
       private sector but also by consumer and advocacy groups and privacy
       commissioners.  It contains ten principles for the protection of personal information
       (see Appendix B) which are based on the OECD guidelines.  Its main advantage is
       that it is being developed by a consensus of views emerging from the CSA Technical
       Committee on Privacy, which is made up of representatives from governments,
       privacy commissioners, privacy and consumer advocates, labour, and the private
       sector.  Also, it could be the basis for a national standard against which other
       voluntary codes could be measured.  Equally, it could provide a standard against
       which the international community could judge the adequacy of Canada's personal
       information protection practices.  However, the manner in which it can be
       implemented is still under study.<P>

       The main objection to the use of voluntary codes is that they are voluntary and, like
       chains, they are only as strong as their weakest links.  Moreover, they are sometimes
       only half measures which are not fully responsive to consumers privacy concerns, in
       that they do not always include the full range of fair information practices.  Often they
       do not include provisions for independent arbitration, provisions for monitoring and
       measuring performance, provisions for sanctions and penalties, or adequate
       provisions for complaint and redress.  Furthermore, they sometimes lack effective
       administration at the corporate and sector levels, and may be tailored more to
       business practices than to the protection of privacy.  Also, their coverage within a
       sector may often be inadequate and inconsistent.  Consumers may lack awareness of
       the existence of voluntary codes and often have little input into their development. 
       Finally, they may not meet the "adequate" standards of privacy protection required
       under the EC draft directives.<P>

       Although most of the support for voluntary codes and standards comes from the
       business sector, consumer and privacy advocates and privacy commissioners see
       voluntary codes and standards as having an important role to play, provided they are
       governed by overarching legislation.   In reaching this view, they are cognizant of the
       shortfalls of legislation, e.g., rigidity, the time taken to implement, etc., as well as the
       benefits of voluntary codes, e.g. flexibility, responsiveness to particular needs, etc. In
       this sense, voluntary codes are seen as being a first step towards data protection, as
       being deserving of legislative back-up if they are to be really effective, and as being
       an acceptable part of the solution if they can be demonstrated to work.  The fact that
       they can help to raise employee awareness, is also acknowledged.  Furthermore,
       some members of the consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner
       groups suggest that they can help industry to "get up speed" before legislation is
       introduced and, in doing so, can guide legislative drafters on sector specific issues
       and means of implementation.

<H3><A NAME="A24">Technological Solutions</A></H3>

       There is general agreement that technological solutions have a part to play.  While
       many maintain that the accelerating pace of technology is a threat to privacy, it is also
       acknowledged that new developments in technology can now allow better privacy
       protection features to be built in from the outset.  This latter factor is seen as being
       very important; supporting the view that before new technology and systems are
       developed, privacy impact assessments should be built in as an essential part of the
       development process.  In fact, one respondent has developed a step by step process
       as to how this can be accomplished and another provides suggested rules for
       evaluating the privacy impacts of emerging technologies.  While many see such
       impact assessments as adding to the cost of new systems and possibly delaying their
       development, others see them as possibly avoiding future costs by eliminating
       expensive retrofits to incorporate privacy protection functions at a later date.   Here,
       the need to add free call-blocking as a requirement for the introduction of name-display
       by the telephone companies is given as an example, as is the abandonment
       of the Lotus Marketplace: Households product.<P>

       The question of whether the information highway should be designed to provide high
       levels of privacy protection and whether it will slow the pace and raise the cost of
       innovation is also addressed by many respondents.  Built in security measures are
       seen as a key in this regard.  Generally speaking, it is acknowledged that there is a
       clear responsibility for basic protective measures.  However, these measures should
       be proportionate to the privacy issues associated with each particular application.  For
       instance , the Internet requires little built-in protective measures, whereas banking
       transactions and access to medical records require a high degree of protection. 
       Between these two extremes, various levels of protective measures could be
       instituted, with the consumer having freedom to choose, sometimes at added cost. 
       Beyond the normal protective measures, such as the use of access codes, new
       developments in encryption, such as "public-key" encryption, and the use of smart
       cards are seen as additional measures.  Also, the implementation of digital
       technology is seen as a significant contribution.  Furthermore, it is suggested that the
       government encourage new technology in this area and support research and
       development in order to provide new opportunities for Canadian industry. On the
       question of whether such measures will be more costly or will inhibit innovation, the
       prevailing view is that this will not occur provided that such measures are not too
       excessive.  However, as one privacy commissioner suggests, the costs, in terms of
       loss of human dignity and autonomy, are too great not to require high levels of privacy
       to be built in.  In the final analysis, the private sector recognizes that if consumers do
       not have confidence that the highway will protect their privacy interests, it will not be
       used to its fullest extent.<P>

       On the question of how Canadians can become better involved in the design of
       potentially privacy-threatening technologies and services, there is a wide variety of
       views.  It is pointed that, at the present time, consumers already have the opportunity
       to become involved.  CRTC hearings on the introduction of new regulated
       telecommunications services is given as one instance.  Participation and advice on
       the development of new CSA technical standards is given as another.  Nonetheless,
       there is strong support from consumer and privacy advocates and privacy
       commissioners for public participation in the development of all significant new and
       potentially privacy threatening systems.  Two private sector organizations also
       support public participation on the basis that consultation can forestall delays and
       possible litigation.  An example is given in relation to the current debate on whether
       fibre optic services should go right into the home or whether they should terminate
       100 metres away and then be transmitted by wireless communication.  The latter
       option is less costly but is fraught with privacy protection implications.  In any event,
       advance consultations with consumers and/or privacy commissioners are seen as
       potentially beneficial to private business, as long they are relatively informal and not
       the subject of long drawn out public hearings.

<H3><A NAME="A25">Consumer Education</A></H3>

       There is wide recognition of a lack of awareness and confusion among the public in
       regard to the benefits and services that are and will be available on the information
       highway.  This is coupled with an equal lack of awareness concerning their privacy
       rights, how to obtain those rights, the consequences of providing personal
       information, and the protective measures which are available.  This leads to vague
       but real concerns which could prejudice the success of the information highway. 
       Therefore, there is widespread agreement that education of the public on these
       matters is both essential and urgent in order to reduce concerns and because of the
       rapid growth of the highway.  In addition, it is recognized that both employees and
       businesses need to be educated on their responsibilities in regard to privacy
       protection.<P>

       A general consensus is evident that both governments and business have major
       responsibilities in this area.  Most private sector organizations indicate their
       commitment.  Many are already engaged in education programs, not only for their
       customers but also for their employees.  Moreover, consumer and privacy advocates
       and privacy commissioners indicate their willingness to become more involved,
       provided funding and resources are made available.  In addition, the media is also
       seen as having a significant role to play.  However, it is also recognized that
       consumers themselves must take the initiative to absorb educational materials
       provided to them, to shop around for the best balance of services and privacy
       protection, and to understand their own responsibilities in regard to privacy matters. 
       Equally, businesses must also take the initiative to inform customers of potential
       privacy problems related to their products and services and not hold back until a crisis
       occurs.<P>

       The tools available are seen to be many and varied.  Everyday business practices,
       coupled with the publicizing of industry codes, will be powerful mechanisms, as will
       the publicizing of the CSA model privacy code.  Massive advertising campaigns are
       not recommended, although periodic public awareness campaigns, which could take
       many forms, are recommended.  The use of information centres, including public and
       academic libraries, for the distribution of materials and brochures also is considered
       to be another avenue.  Brochures and publications can be directed at different
       audiences, including the public at large, schools and universities, and customers of
       businesses.  Other suggestions include a privately funded national toll-free privacy
       "hotline" for consumers and the inclusion of a confidentiality clause in all contracts.

<H3><A NAME="A26">CONCLUSIONS</A></H3>

<H3><A NAME="A27">Concerns</A></H3>

       It is quite that evident that there is a wide range of real public concerns on privacy
       matters which, if not addressed quickly, could escalate to the point that the effective
       functioning of the information highway could be jeopardized.

<H3><A NAME="A28">How to Ensure Privacy?</A></H3>

       There is a significant divergence of views between the majority of members of the
       private sector and consumer and privacy advocacy and privacy commissioner groups
       in regard to the relative merits of legislation and voluntary codes.  However, there also
       is a pragmatic and conciliatory approach to these differences which makes a
       compromise achievable.<P>

       No single approach to the resolution of the problems is viable.  Therefore, a
       combination of the approaches outlined in the Discussion Paper is most likely to
       succeed because they are inter-related and mutually supportive.<P>

       In order to achieve comprehensive solutions to the various problems identified by
       respondents, within the minimum possible time frame, a well-coordinated plan should
       be developed.<P>

       The following are potential elements of a plan which the Advisory Council may wish to
       consider.<P>

<UL>
<LI>The establishment by legislation of a national framework of privacy standards,
       probably based on the CSA model privacy code, under which private sector codes
       would operate and be bound.<P>
<LI>Revisions to the federal Privacy Act to overcome its current shortcomings,
       including a revised preamble, provision for the protection and security of personal
       information, and provision for the establishment of privacy impact assessments
       within the public sector.<P>
<LI>Development of a program to reinforce, strengthen and update the application of
       privacy requirements within the public sector.<P>
<LI>Early discussion with the provinces to implement national standards on a country-wide basis.<P>
<LI>Development of legislation to make it an offence to intercept private radio-based
       telecommunications, and to generally prohibit the manufacture, importation, sale
       and distribution of scanners capable of monitoring radio-based telephones,
       including cellular phones.<P>
<LI>Development of a program to systematically promote the development of private
       sector codes based on the CSA model privacy code.<P>
<LI>Creation of a joint government/industry program to promote and support the
       development of privacy protection technologies.<P>
<LI>Promotion of consultations between industry/government, consumer groups and
       privacy commissioners on the development of significant and new potentially
       privacy-threatening technologies and systems.<P>
<LI>Development of a joint industry/government privacy education program in
       consultation with consumer groups and privacy commissioners.<P>
<LI>Establishment of consultations between government and the medical and social
       research groups to resolve the apparent dichotomy between the protection of
       personal information and the need to carry out medical and social research
       necessary to promote the public good.<P>
<LI>Development by the government of a standard privacy protection clause for all
       contracts or agreements involving the transfer or exchange of personal
       information with all institutions outside of government.<P>
<LI>Issuance of a public announcement after adoption of the plan and ministerial
       approval.<P>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="A29">Failure to Address the Problem</A></H3>

       Failure to address the major problems identified by respondents could be followed by
       increasing public privacy concerns, coupled with avoidance of the use of the
       information highway.  Also, it might lead to Canada's privacy protection standards
       being considered inadequate under the European Communities' privacy directives.</BODY></HTML>
