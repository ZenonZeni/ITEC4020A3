<P>When the wave of layoffs occurred in the early `80s, those washed away were, for the most part, among the blue-collar ranks. But just as the ocean doesn't produce a single tidal wave and call it good, there has been a series of layoffs. The word &quot;downsizing&quot; has entered general parlance in order to make talking about it less painful. Those who have been caught in the undertow don't find it more comfortable, regardless what it is called. White-collar workers foundand continue to findthemselves out of jobs, too. A variety of initiatives aimed at improving productivity and profitability--lean practices, reengineering, TQM, etc.--depending on who is in charge (i.e., someone interested in long-term growth or someone interested in short-term improvement to the bottom line)has led to further employment wipe-outs. With the acquisition of supplier companies by other supplier companies, there are additional job losses as what is called &quot;rationalization&quot; takes place: managers figure out what's redundant in the combined organization, and then there go the people.

<P>Although none of this is pleasant to think about it, 
you should know that things aren't going to get better. If you are a manager--at any level of an organization--then you really need to learn how to surf, because the waves 
are going to get more aggressive.

<P>One of the most astute, telling, and dead-on accurate assessments I've come across vis-&agrave;-vis what 
management means today and what it is likely to mean in the future is found in <I>Stewardship</I> by Peter Block 
(Berrett-Koehler; 1993). He writes: &quot;No one should be able to make a living simply planning, watching, controlling, or evaluating the actions of others.&quot; In other words, the age of the command-and-control voyeur is gone. Do something tangible, add value, or you'll undoubtedly have to find something else to occupy your working hours.

<P>Or consider this from James Champy's <I>Reengineering Management: The Mandate for New Leadership</I> (HarperBusiness; 1995): &quot;[W]hat must be abandoned by the new management of our corporate ships--that is, both officers and crew--is a whole ideology, a whole way of thinking about power. Power no longer belongs in boxes, in titles, in ranks. In the new heavy weather, those are nothing more than heady abstractions, eloquent vacancies, and they count for nothing. What counts--for power, authority, responsibility--is what you can do, you yourself, you with your own skills and personal qualities.&quot; This whole theme is the basis of a just-published book, <I>Managing Without Management: A Post-Management Manifesto for Business Simplicity</I> by Richard Koch and Ian Godden (Nicholas Brealey Publishing; 248 pp.; $25.00). These guys--both of whom are British management 
consultants (yes, they realize that they are biting the hands that feed)--don't pull any punches: &quot;[E]very large 
corporation contains thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of people whose main role is to manage 
a corporation's internal processes, and whose value to the corporation's customer's and owners is negligible or even negative. It is this sort of management, including their support staff, that is at the root of the large corporation's problems; and systematically rooting out such management and the mentality behind it, without sacrificing control and old-fashioned leadership, is the key to the rebirth of the large corporation.&quot;

<P>They take the small, customer-focused firm as the model of what can be, what should be. These organizations have people who are hands-on, adding value to customers. In contrast, they maintain that senior managers in large firms spend 80% of their time involved in &quot;reactive problem solving&quot; and the minutia of business: 30% in meeting about problems; 15 to 20% dealing with the politics of those meetings; and 30% doing things like writing memos about procedures and appointments. What they should be doing, they note, is meeting with customers and suppliers, visiting their operations, coaching and team building, and performing strategic decision making. Koch and Godden argue that information technology now available (think of enterprise resource planning [ERP] 
and manufacturing execution systems [MES]) make it possible for large organizations to operate with fewer people who are involved in planning, organization and administering. Koch and Godden are talking &quot;fewer&quot; as in &quot;a 50 
percent reduction in the number of managerial, clerical and other overhead functions over 10 years.&quot; And their clock 
is running now.

<P>Whether this will happen to this extent remains to be seen. But what is abundantly clear right now is that if you're not tangibly adding value to what your customers receive, and if you're not obsessed with providing your customers with a superb product, then you're probably doing something that doesn't need to be done. Which, as lean thinkers everywhere know, is <I>muda</I>waste. And no firm--big or small--can afford that.
