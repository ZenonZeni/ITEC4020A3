New Car Sales Up 4.8% in 1995


   According to the association of automotive dealers in Japan,
sales of new cars, excluding light vehicles, rose 4.8%, to 5.15
million units, in 1995.  This was the first time in three years
that the total exceeded 5 million units, supported largely by
steady demand for RVs and imported vehicles.  Passenger cars
accounted for 3.5 million, up 4.2%, thanks to lower prices on
imports and the debut of new models at the Tokyo Motor Show.
Trucks represented 1.6 million, up 6.4%.  While growth in 1996
will trail the 1995 figure, association sources believe sales
will nonetheless increase.
