        <H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>It's the sizzle, not the steak, 
        <BR>that makes the fat deadly.
</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=75%>
<P>
        Our culture places a very high value on human life and health. We spend enormous
amounts of money on health care, we have the world's most advanced medical
technologies, we've conducted the most sophisticated medical research. You'd think
that by 1994 we'd be good at taking care of ourselves. And yet we're aII stumbling
through the dark ages of health care. For every &quot;miraculous&quot; cure, immunization, or
treatment that's been introduced over the course of this century, there is a whole
new class of degenerative and systemic disease that the medical establishment appears
powerless to control. Even more alarming, diseases once associated with much older
patients are moving down into the not-so-old age categories.

<P>     Cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, diabetes, even fatigue-all have
origins in environmental factors (with few debatable exceptions).  Some of these
factors, such as air and water pollution caused by industry and transportation, have
become an integral part of our economy.  One could argue (although I would disagree)
that the economic and cultural benefits from these polluting activities have been
worth the adverse health effects.

<P>     But large-scale environmental pollution is only one of many factors.  Consider
the food pollution that is routinely a part of the SAD (Standard American Diet).  As
if the environmental pollution that finds its way into our food supply isn't bad
enough, we go on to <I>deliberately</I> add contaminants known to be deadly.

<P>Meat is the worst offender. Even without contaminants, there are compelling
reasons to be careful when consuming commercial meat products:
<A NAME="OXID"> </A>
<P>     <B>Oxidized saturated fat</B> After three decades of media misinformation about fat, the conventional wisdom is
that saturated fat is bad, whiIe unsaturated fat 's good - or at least okay. You can
trace it back to the margarine and cooking oil commercials of the '60s. And even
though advertisers were forced to broadcast retractions when their claims of cardiac
health-giving properties from polyunsaturates were shown to have virtually no
scientific basis, the myth persists.

<P>     In reality, nearly all naturally occurring fats can be healthful and all can be
deadly. The difference is not the degree of saturation but the degree of heating,
aging, and oxidation. It's the sizzle, not the steak, that makes the fat deadly. 
That sizzle is a free-radical factory, turning natural fat into billions of charged
particles ready to wreak havoc on your own lipid-management systems.

<P>     There's no way around this one-grilled, blackened, seared, or even well-done meat
should be off limits.  Meanwhile, some progressive nutritionists are recommending
that meat be well cooked to help break down residues of artificial hormones and
antibiotics used to raise the animals.
<P>

<HR width=75%>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><EM>Meat Is The Worst Offender</EM></CENTER></H3>

<HR width=75%>
<P>
<B>Cholesterol.</B> This is still an area of widespread misconception. Cholesterol has its good
side, and if this unique fat isn't burned during cooking or oxidized during storage,
it's nothing to worry about.  We know that the cholesterol you eat is generally not
the cholesterol that may end up in your arteries.  

<P>The problem with meat is not the
cholesterol itself, but certain amino acids.  Meat is high in methionine, which is
normally metabolized by vitamin B6 and other nutrients plentiful in fresh organ
meats.  If we consumed the organ meats with the rest of the animal, there would be no
problem.  But most of the time the lack of these nutrients allows methionine to turn
into homocysteine, a substance shown to be toxic to artery walls.  The cholesterol
begins to accumulate after the homocysteine-induced damage begins. (This
widely-accepted theory is explained in more detail in Digest #I.)

<P>     <B>Calcium and osteoporosis</B> Other amino acids from meat degrade into ammonia, which in turn results in a
significant amount of calcium being excreted. If calcium isn't readily available, it
is pulled out of bone tissue. The long-term result is a drastically increased
propensity to osteoporosis. One counter measure is to eat more of the animal
including digestible bones. Another is to go heavy on very fresh leafy green
vegetables, free of pesticides and herbicides, with lots of available calcium. 
Neither strategy is very common.

<P>
<HR>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><I> Additives - four main categories of contaminants:</I></CENTER></H3>

<P>     <B>Antibiotics, Penicillin, tetracycline, and related antibiotics</B> are used virtually without
regulation in raising livestock. There's no need to wait for the animals to get
sick-a subtherapeutic&quot; dose is routinely included with their food. This prevents
disease and wipes out large classes of natural intestinal microbes. For reasons that
are still not clear, the use of subtherapeutic antibiotics increases growth rates,
especially in the overcrowded conditions this technology has made possible.

<P>     The abundant use of antibiotics has also produced strains of bacteria that are
amazingly resistant. The genes that carry the coding for this resistance can
sometimes be transferred to the microbes responsible for human diseases. There's
little question that antibiotics, especially tetracycline, are showing dangerous
accumulations in our agricultural environment. Penicillin-resistant bacteria are
able to destroy penicillin. But tetracycline-resistant strains generally reject the
tetracycline, returning it to the environment.


<P>     These substances are considered drugs for human use - you need a prescription to
buy them. But farmers can use them almost indiscriminately as long as they comply
with withdrawal times before slaughter. This rule, however, is difficult to enforce.

<A NAME="HORMONES"> </A>
<P>     <B>Hormones Diethylstilbestrol, or DES</B>, is a synthetic form of estrogen commonly used to
promote growth in livestock from the 1950s until it was banned in 1979. DES was also
administered to more than three million pregnant women. The ban was only possible
when it was found to be clearly linked to vaginal cancer and other very serious
problems in the recipients' children. Not only has enforcement of the DES ban been
notoriously lax, but other estrogen-containing hormone products have remained in use.
 Without the benefit of the tragic human &igrave;testing&quot; that highlighted the dangers of
DES, these other products enjoy a strong market. An estimated 99 percent of all
commercial feedlot cattle are now implanted with a hormone pellet!
<P>

<HR WIDTH=75%>

<P>     This environmental estrogen has been shown to be a crucial player in the
development of cancer, osteoporosis, menopause, and even PMS, as reported in the
<I>InternationaI Journal of Health Services</I> (I 990, 20:277). There are significant
gaps in our knowledge here. But considering the power of the meat and drug
industries combined, it's doubtful that answers will come quickly or easily.
<A NAME="PRES"> </A>
<P>     <B>Preservatives and colorings</B> We've known for a generation that nitrites 
are extremely carcinogenic, yet their
use in cured meats persists. A recent study in <I>Cancer Causes and Controls</I> reports
that children who eat more than 12 hot dogs per month have nine times the average
risk of contracting childhood leukemia. Other articles in the same issue link hot
dog consumption to brain tumors. Even the fathers' consumption of these foods before
conception was found to be a risk factor.

<P>     These single food-specific results suggest other socioeconomic dietary health
links at work.  But the message is clear-high-risk additives are widely used, and the
FDA's assessment of acceptable risks might be very different from your own.
<A NAME="DDT"> </A>
<P>     <B>Pesticides</B> DDT has been banned for decades, 
but we are still exposed through airborne
exposure from foreign sources. And other insecticides and herbicides have taken its
place.  When we eat meat, we are putting ourselves at the top of a short food chain
from feed grains to livestock to our own fatty tissue, in which measurable residues
of DDT can still be found.

<P>     Chlorinated hydrocarbons, the general class of chemical that includes many
pesticides, is easily stored in fat.  So, meat remains one of the most common means
of transportation for poisons to find their way into your body.

<P>     Rachel Carson's words from her 1962 book, <I>Silent Spring</I>, still ring true: &quot;As
crude a weapon as the caveman's club, the chemical barrage bas been hurled against
the fabric of life.&quot; How tragic and ironic that Rachel Carson died of breast cancer!

<P>     Is there any hope for getting meat and poultry cleaned up?  For raising awareness
about these hazards?  For research organizations such as the National Cancer
Institute with its two-billion dollar annual budget to proclaim the perils of these
additives and contaminants?

<P>     Samuel Epstein, MD, speaking at the American Association of Naturopathic
Physicians at their 1994 annual convention in San Diego, said:

<P>     &igrave;In all the vast amount of money that NCI [National Cancer Institute] has spent
on the dietary studies, and ACS [American Cancer Society] has spent on the role of
diet, there hasn't been a single dollar spent on the role of dietary contaminants.&quot;

<P>     You don't have to look far into the composition of the boards of directors of NCI
and ACS to discover major conflicts of interest.  Pharmaceutical manufacturers,
chemical companies, big (polluting) industries, and major media are all well
represented.  It should not be a surprise that the official line from NCI is that
only 2 to 3 percent of all cancer in the U.S. is the result of industrial products
and environmental pollution, while they estimate that 4 percent is the result of
occupational exposure.  On the other hand, NCI acknowledges 30 percent from smoking. 
What causes the other 63 percent?  You decide!

<P>     Meanwhile, the NCI spends one billion dollars per year on research, attempting to
unravel the inner workings of the living cell. It's good stuff, and they've achieved
impressive new depths of understanding.  But researchers who seriously believe that
this will ever result in a cure for cancer are few and far between. Only 2.5 percent
of the NCI budget goes for &igrave;avoidable exposure &quot;and none of it for looking at food
additives.

<P>     Perhaps you have seen the documentaries on TV revealing that standards for meat
inspection have not changed in 87 years; that we can't see, smell, or touch the
bacterial contamination; that glass, hair, pieces of bone, fecal material, and metal
shavings have been found in meat; that 9,00O Americans die each year from
contaminated food. Death. Final. What about the hundreds of thousands suffering
from arteriolosclerosis and breast cancer, now theorized to be related, at least in
part, to toxin-carrying cells in our food?  The FDA goes vitaminbashing instead of
using that money and energy to clean up this mess.

<P>     I'm sure your stomach turned as mine did as I watched these films and saw the pus
from animal sores pour out all over the meat-cutting table, and then witnessed how
other meat, as it was sliced, came in contact with the pus. And my brain
flip-flopped as I pondered the news that babies are born with antibiotics in their
cells <I>before a pediatrician ever administers the child's first 
prescription for the drug.</I>

<P>     What to do? Is it reasonable to expect the NCI to recognize that cancer is
almost totally preventable? All we really have to do is: - Keep carcinogens out of
our food and environment - Educate the consumer about these findings - Identify
destructive foods and cooking/processing styles that result in carcinogenic  
products - Educate the consumer about the importance of supplements as long as our
food and environment are not safe.

<P>     &quot;You're dreaming,&quot; I hear you say. And you're right. 
The political will, the
population of educated consumers, and the access to unbiased research simply aren't
there. To be sure, there are technical controversies to be worked out at every turn.
 One would think that's how a two billion-dollar budget should be used.

<P>The inescapable conclusion, from a personal health perspective, is simply to
avoid meat. And yet, among all the cultures of the world, there is none that is or
has been traditionally totally vegetarian. Animal protein is important for human
health. Meat can be good for you. When free of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics,
harmful bacteria, and additives, very lightly cooked or raw, it can be the mainstay
of a healthful diet. But such meat is largely unavailable in North American culture,
and its production is incompatible with a modern urban life-style.

<P>     I'll see you in the organic produce section.

<HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>GOOD MEAT IS AVAILABLE!</CENTER></H2>

<P>     No drugs or chemicals. Not even antibiotics. No pesticides or herbicides. Pure
food. Pure water.

<P>     Don't you wish you could have grown up in such an environment? Or perhaps raised
your children this way? An uncontaminated setting Is hard to come by in today's
world, but that's exactly how Coleman's animals are raised in an effort to supply us
with top-quality, safe meats! Maybe that's why Coleman provides the number one
best-selling natural beef in the United States-with an 80-percent industry market
share.  What about pleasing your palate, you ask? The scores are high here, too:
Coleman meats rated a gold medal in numerous taste awards (including Monde Selection
in Europe and Chefs of America in the United States).


<P>     Food safety is ensured from farm to fork because of how the meat is tendered from
conception to consumption. Coleman supports, Promoted, and practices rotational
grazing and other sustainable agriculture methods, plus humane animal care. So if
steak, roast beef, or a hefty hamburger is on your menu, please make it pure.
