he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an
international group of 2,500 climate scientists
assembled under the authority of the United Nations to
monitor global climate, recently released a report
documenting the causal link between human activity and
global climate change.  The IPCC report declares that
the 6 billion metric tons of carbon emitted into the
atmosphere globally each year are indeed heating the
planet. Because economic growth and energy consumption
have historically marched in lockstep, there is great
concern that policy measures aimed at reducing
fossil-fuel use could constrain future prosperity.  <p>
     Fortunately, the world need not choose between
catastrophic climate change and 
economic growth. A host of new technologies offers the
means to simultaneously boost the economy and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. So while some argue that
cutting U.S. carbon dioxide emissions could be a costly
drag on the economy, this report provides dozens of case
studies that show the opposite: the reduction of carbon
dioxide emissions can be a beneficial side effect of
profitable business choices.

<h3>A. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Increase
Economic Growth While Decreasing the Threat of Global
Climate Change</h3><p>
<p>
History shows that the United States can increase
economic growth while cutting energy consumption. Figure
1 shows that from 1973 to 1986, Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) grew 35 percent while the energy consumed per unit
of GDP fell to 2.4 percent per year. <p>

<h4><I>Figure 1: <br>Energy Efficiency: Decoupling Economic Growth from Energy Consumption
<br clear=all><hr></I></h4></BLOCKQUOTE>

     By the end of this period, Americans were saving
over $150 billion each year through improved energy
efficiency, and had avoided a 50 percent cumulative
increase in carbon emissions. <p>
     Figure 2 shows that moderating energy use is
fundamental to solving the global climate change
dilemma.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><hr><a href="../img/ExecSum-Fig-2.gif"><img align=left src="../t/ExecSum-Fig-2.gif"></a><p>
<h4><I>Figure 2:<br>Sources of Emissions Driving Climate Change<br clear=all><hr></I></h4>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
     Since 1986, however, low fossil fuel prices in the
U.S. have encouraged an increase in energy consumption.
Today, Americans spend $505 billion per year on energy,
and U.S. carbon emissions have reached an all-time high:
1,394 million metric tons in 1994, accounting for 25
percent of the global total. Unless decision- makers
place greater emphasis on efficiency and renewable
energy, these trends will continue. The U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE) projects that with current trends and
policies, energy use could increase to about 104
quadrillion Btu (quads) per year by 2010, up from 85
quads today. Given this rise in demand and resultant
increases in energy prices, this could translate to a
national energy bill in 2010 of about $950 billion
 -  and an increase in carbon emissions of 17
percent.<p>
     At a global summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992,
the United States was one of 154 nations and the
European Community to sign the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. The framework stipulates
international commitments to cut greenhouse gas
emissions, including carbon dioxide emissions, to 1990
levels. Despite this commitment, as Figure 3 shows, U.S.
carbon emissions are continuing to grow at about one
percent per year.<p>

<h3>B. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Markets Are
Growing Rapidly, and Creating Jobs</h3><p>
<p>
The United States has barely scratched the surface of
energy-saving opportunities available in the economy.
The global market for energy efficiency has grown to
over $80 billion annually, and is expected to reach
$115-140 billion annually by 2015. The American Council
for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) estimates that
U.S. efficiency improvements consistent with a 2.4
percent annual reduction in national energy intensity
(the rate achieved in the U.S. during 1973-1986) could
create a 
net increase of nearly 500,000 jobs by the year 2000,
and nearly 1.1 million new jobs by 2010. (Energy
intensity measures energy use per dollar of GDP, and
reflects how efficiently goods and services are
produced.) The majority of new jobs nationwide would be
created as money saved on power bills is recirculated
into the economy and spent on additional products and
services.<p>
     Investments in energy efficiency 
can lower consumers' energy bills, reduce energy costs,
cut oil imports, increase the net number of jobs, and
boost incomes  -  all while cutting carbon dioxide
emissions and reducing the threat of global climate
change.<P>



<h3>C. Numerous Case Studies Demonstrate That Carbon Dioxide
Emissions Can Be Cut While Adding to U.S. Prosperity</h3><p>

When they invest in energy efficiency, U.S. businesses
improve their bottom line by lowering their energy
bills, and boost their productivity and increase their
competitiveness  -  all while cutting greenhouse
emissions.

<h4>1. Industrial Energy-Efficiency Successes</h4>

U.S. industries spend $121 billion per year on energy
and consume about a quarter of all U.S. energy. Several
studies show that industry could cut its energy
intensity by 11 to 38 percent between now and the year
2015. When businesses improve their manufacturing
processes to use energy and raw materials more
efficiently, productivity, profitability, and employment
often increase. At the same time, carbon dioxide
emissions and environmental compliance costs typically
fall.
<p>
 <B>3M Corporation.</B> 3M has cut its energy use per
unit of production in half over the last 20 years,
reducing overall emissions by one-third. The company has
worked aggressively to achieve an ambitious but
practical corporate goal: cut energy use per unit of
production and per square foot of building space by 20

percent. It has pledged to implement all energy-saving
projects with a 15 percent or greater return on
investment (a payback period of six to seven years).
Energy cost-cutting has made the company more
competitive and more productive. 3M is also marketing a
new "dual cure coating" process that is used for
aircraft topcoats and primers, and for coatings for the
backing of high-temperature electrical tape. The new
coatings could eliminate an estimated 236,000 metric
tons of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) annually
 -  7.5 percent of U.S. total emissions. Because the
new process requires less energy, it could also reduce
carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 2 million
metric tons a year. By 2010, the cumulative energy
savings could be greater than all the electricity used
in all the commercial establishments in the state of
Iowa in 1995.<P>
 <B>Dow Chemical.</B> Dow Chemical's Louisiana Division,
whose 2,400 employees in more than 20 plants make
chemicals such as propylene, began a yearly contest in
1982 to find energy-saving projects that paid for
themselves in one year and that required a capital
investment of less than $200,000. The first year, the
contest produced 27 winning projects that required a
total capital investment of $1.7 million and produced an
average return on investment of 173 percent. The 1983
contest had 32 winning projects requiring a total
capital investment of $2.2 million and providing a 340
percent return on investment  -  producing an annual,
ongoing savings of $7.5 million. The yearly contest was
so successful that Dow changed the rules to eliminate
the $200,000 limit and to include savings from all kinds
of waste reduction, 
not just energy. For 575 projects implemented throughout
the 1980s, the average return was 204 percent (audited).
After ten years and nearly 700 projects, the 1992
contest had 109 winning entries that enjoyed an average
return of 305 percent; the 1993 
contest generated 140 projects with an average return of
298 percent.<p>
<h4>2. Utility Industry Efficiency Successes</h4> <p>
<p>
America's utilities provide roughly $260 billion each
year in energy services to homes, businesses and
industries
  -  a figure that represents 
5.2 percent of the gross national product (GNP). At the
same time, U.S. utilities emitted approximately 500
million metric tons of carbon in 1993, or about 36
percent of the annual U.S. total. This figure has
dropped from where it would have been had n
ot a wide array of electric utility energy-saving
programs saved the U.S. economy billions of dollars. 
<p>
     From 1989 to 1993, utility investments in
energy-efficiency programs tripled to about $3 billion
per year. These investments reduced national generation
in 1993 by 44,000 gigawatt-hours, 1.6 percent of total
U.S. generation. These savings cut consumers' utility
bills by nearly $4 billion that year, while reducing
carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 27.8 million
metric tons.<p>
     Utility efficiency programs in California provided
net benefits of $2.2 billion during the period from 1990
to 1994. In 1994, the average cost of saved
kilowatt-hours was less than 2 cents per kilowatt-hour
 -  less than the wholesale price of power produced
by the cheapest new generating plant. New York utility
programs delivered $1.4 billion in net benefits to
customers between 1990 to 1994. In the Pacific
Northwest, efficiency programs during 1995 saved more
than 900 average megawatts of electricity at an average
cost of 2 to 2-1/2 cents per kilowatt-hour, saving
retail consumers 
$2 billion. The efforts avoided more than 5.35 million
metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. In Wisconsin,
utilities achieved a cumulative reduction in energy
demand from 1988 to 1994 of 2,959 gigawatt-hours, while
reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 1.8 million metric
tons. From 1995 through 2013, projections show,
Wisconsin utility efficiency programs could reduce
electricity usage by 5,152 gigawatt-hours, preventing
more than 3.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
emissions. In Massachusetts, programs at three major
utilities delivered net benefits of nearly $400 million
between 1990 and 1993.<p>
     Market uncertainties due to proposed utility
industry restructuring are currently causing utilities
to cut back on all long-term investments, including
efficiency. However, the newest utility restructuring
models  -  from California and New England  - 
indicate that energy efficiency investments will
continue. The most 
profitable course for future, still-regulated
distribution companies will be to select the lowest-cost
option to meet energy needs. A recent report projects
that utility efficiency programs will deliver 3 percent
of electricity demand annually by the year 2000,
avoiding 45 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
emissions.<p>
<p>
<h4>3. Efficiency Successes in Buildings, Equipment, and Appliances</h4><p>
<p>
The U.S. could cut energy consumption in buildings by 33
to 50 percent by the year 2015, simply by investing in
cost-effective, commercially available tech- nologies.
Substantial progress in building efficiency has been
made already. Improved building codes, energy-efficient
designs, retrofits, and improved equipment and
appliances have stabilized energy intensity in the
commercial sector, and have reduced energy intensity in
residences. Offices and homes now get the same
services
  -  lights, heating, air-conditioning  -  using
less energy than in the past. But much more energy waste
can be trimmed.<p>

<H4>a. Successful Building Design</H4><p>
Energy design decisions are long-lasting. The median
lifetime for commercial buildings is between 50 and 70
years. The potential for savings is high. A 
reasonably attainable 30 percent improvement in U.S.
building efficiency would reduce energy bills by $75
billion annually in 15 years.<p>
     Energy-efficient building and office design can
significantly increase worker productivity. By improving
lighting, heating, and cooling, workers are made more
comfortable and productive. An increase of 1 percent in
productivity can provide savings that exceed a company's
entire energy bill.<P>
 <B>Lockheed Missiles and Space Company.</B> One of the
most successful examples of efficient design for a
commercial office 
building is Lockheed Missiles and Space Company's
Building 157 in Sunnyvale, California. A central atrium
in the 600,000 square-foot office brings daylight deep
into the building, saving Lockheed about 75 percent on
its lighting bill. Since daylight generates less heat
than office lights, peak air-conditioning has been cut
substantially. Overall, the building runs with about
half the energy costs of a typical building of similar
size. Although the energy-efficient improvements added
roughly $2 million to the building's $50 million capital
costs, the energy savings, worth nearly $500,000 per
year, paid for themselves in a little more than four
years. More important, however, have been productivity
improvements. Russell Robinson, manager of Facility
Interior Development, reports that productivity is up
 while absenteeism has declined. According to Don
Aitken, chairman of the Department of Environmental
Studies at nearby San Jose State University, "Lockheed
moved a known population of workers into the building
and absenteeism dropped 15 percent." Aitken led numerous
tours of Building 157 after it opened, and was told by
Lockheed officials that the reduced absenteeism paid 100
percent of the extra cost of the building in the first
year. The architect, Lee Windheim, has learned that
productivity rose 15 percent on the first major contract
done in the building.
<p>
<H4>b. Lighting Retrofits</H4><p>
Lighting accounts for 19 percent of all electricity sold
in the U.S. and costs consumers nearly $40 billion per
year. The best light bulbs on the market use only a
quarter as much energy as conventional 
incandescent light bulbs and last ten times longer, each
preventing the burning of as much as 400 pounds of coal,
and saving consumers more than $35 net on their
electricity bills over the life of the improved bulb.
<p>
     If energy-efficient lighting were installed
everywhere profitable to do so, America's demand for
electricity would drop by more than 10 percent. This
would result in annual reductions of 
1.3 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 600,000
metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 202 million metric
tons of carbon dioxide. That's a reduction in carbon
dioxide emissions equivalent to taking 44.5 million cars
off the road. These reductions represent 12 percent of
all U.S. utility emissions.
<p>
 <B>Boeing Corporation.</B> Boeing has been a participant
in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Green
Lights program to promote energy-efficient lighting.
Lighting upgrades have cut electricity use by 25 to 90
percent in several million square feet of Boeing's
facilities, with a 53 percent annual return on
investment. Boeing's upgrades have saved 130,000
megawatt-hours, have paid for themselves in just two
years, and have cut carbon dioxide emissions by 18,070
metric tons per year. They have 
also reduced annual emissions of other air pollutants,
including sulfur dioxide (down 4,536 metric tons) and
nitrogen oxides (down 1,815 metric tons). The new
lighting has improved workers' abilities to detect
manufacturing defects by 20 percent. According to
Lawrence Friedman, Boeing's conservation manager, the
savings from catching errors early,while difficult to
measure, are estimated to exceed greatly the cost of the
energy-efficient upgrades.<P>
<H4>c. Efficient Appliances and Equipment</H4><p>
Appliance and equipment standards are saving consumers
$1.9 billion annually, and ultimately will save
consumers $132 billion net over the lifetime of products
purchased by 2030, providing a ratio of total benefits
to costs of 3-to-1. Past and necessary future appliance
and equipment standards could cut residential
electricity use 7 percent by the year 2015, saving about
80,000 gigawatt-hours and 21,000 megawatts annually, and
avoiding approximately 50.6 million metric tons of
carbon dioxide per year. <p>
<p>
 <B>Whirlpool's "Golden Carrot"&#129; Super-Efficient
Refrigerator.</B> Refrigerators consume 20 percent of all
residential electricity, and average about 685
kilowatt-hours per refrigerator each year. To encourage
manufacturers to develop and market
refrigerator-freezers that are substantially more
efficient, a group of electric utilities formed a
consortium  -  the Super Efficient Refrigerator
Program, Inc. (SERP)  -  that put up a $30 million
pot of incentive money. In June 1993, SERP selected two
semi-finalists - including Whirlpool.  As shown in
Figure 4, energy and carbon savings from the Golden
Carrot&#129; refrigerator are substantial. Compared to
an owner of a 1978 model, each owner of a Golden
Carrot
&#129; refrigerator saves $135 per year in electricity
while cutting carbon emissions by two-thirds.

 <B>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.</B> The U.S.
Department of Energy program at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory (LBNL) has made enormous
contributions to national energy efficiency by
contributing to the development of electronic ballasts
and low emissivity, or "Low-E," windows. Electronic
ballasts, virtually unknown in the mid-1970s when LBNL's
research began, now capture a 24-percent share of the
ballast market. Cumulative energy savings attributable
to electronic ballasts from 1988 to 1993 total $400
million. By 2015, use of electronic ballasts could avoid
environmental emissions of approximately 157,000 metric
tons of sulfur dioxide, 144,000 metric tons of nitrogen
oxides, and 73 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.
Today, Low-E windows have captured 36 percent of the
U.S. windows market, boasting $600 million in annual
sales.      By 1993, the cumulative energy savings to
the U.S. was $760 million, and will reach $17 billion by
the year 2015. By that year, Low-E windows are projected to prevent, through
avoided electricity generation, 142,000 metric tons of
sulfur dioxide, 129,000 metric tons of nitrogen oxides,
and more than 64 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
emissions.
     Energy-efficient building codes, building designs,
retrofit investments, and equipment and appliance
standards all contribute to greater business
competitiveness and economic growth  -  while helping
to avoid carbon dioxide emissions.<P>
<h4>4. Successes in the Transportation Sector</h4><p>
<p>
The combustion of fossil fuels in America's
transportation sector consumed 35 percent of the
nation's energy in 1990 and produced more than 32
percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. 
Transportation will be the fastest growing source of
U.S. carbon dioxide emissions over the long term  - 
by far  -  unless Americans take aggressive steps to
build efficiency into transportation systems.<p>
     Two-thirds of total U.S. oil consumption goes to
transportation, and each day Americans use 4 million
more barrels of oil for transportation than the U.S.
produces. The United States imports half the petroleum
it uses, a fact that contributed $56 billion 
to the U.S. trade deficit in 1994, and the trend is
upward. The gap between what we use and what we produce
is projected to rise to 9 million barrels per day by 
the year 2010. Dependence on oil imports threatens U.S.
national security, making our economy vulnerable to
foreign cartels, price swings, supply disruptions, and
foreign wars.<p>
     Transportation energy use accounts 
for about half of all air pollution emissions in the
U.S. and more than 80 percent of air pollution in
cities. Highway vehicles alone account for 26 percent of
U.S. emissions of VOCs, 32 percent of nitrogen oxides,
and 62 percent of total carbon monoxide. 
The American Lung Association estimates that
America spends $50 billion each year on health care as a
direct result of air pollution.<p>
     Fortunately, fuel efficiency has improved
substantially in the transportation sector during the
last 20 years, and efficiency gains are far from
exhausted. <P>
 <B>Federal Corporate Automobile Fuel Efficiency
(CAFE)</B> requirements for new vehicles are one of the
major energy-policy success stories of the past 20
years. CAFE standards doubled automobile fuel efficiency
from 14 miles per gallon (mpg) to 27 mpg between 1975
and 1985. The standards, which have not been improved
since the mid-1980s, are presently saving nearly 3
million barrels of oil per day  -  which corresponds
to $50 billion of consumer savings and 150 million
metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions avoided
annually.<p>
     As shown in Figure 5, working prototypes could
easily double vehicle 
fuel efficiency, while electric and hybrid-electric
vehicles  -  if incentives are created to spur market
development  -  could usher in a new age of clean
transportation, powered by renewables-derived
electricity.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
 <B>General Motors Corporation</B>. Many manufacturers
are moving ahead with electric vehicle production.
General Motors originally unveiled its Impact model in
1990. The Impact, with a composite body and stiff
aluminum frame, incorporates an advanced electric motor,
electronic controls, regenerative braking, and
aerodynamic streamlining. The energy cost of running an
Impact is only a quarter that of a gasoline-powered car.
The driving range is about 100 miles using its 1,100
pounds of lead-acid batteries. Those who have
test-driven the Impact have given it rave reviews for
its quiet ride, maneuverability, and rapid acceleration.
Even counting the emissions from the power plants used
to charge it, the Impact produces two-thirds less
pollution than California will allow under its 1998
ultra-low emission standard, and 72 percent less carbon
dioxide than is emitted by a 1994 Ford Taurus.<p>
<h4>5. Renewable Energy: Coming of Age</h4><p>
<p>
Efficiency reduces consumption while maintaining or
improving the services provided by energy. Renewable
energy could supply new power needs with no carbon
emissions. Renewable energy technologies
  -  wind, photovoltaics, solar-thermal, and
geothermal
  -  have made major advances in the past decade.
Figure 6 highlights the dramatic drop in renewable
energy costs. <p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><hr>
<a href="../img/ExecSum-Fig-6.gif"><img align=left src="../t/ExecSum-Fig-6.gif"></a><p>
<h4><I>Figure 6:<br> Renewable Energy Costs are Dropping<br clear=all><hr>
</I></h4>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

     For example, the cost of wind-generated electricity
in the U.S. dropped from 25 cents per kilowatt-hour in
1984 to less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour today. The
cost curves for solar-thermal and photovoltaic utility
plants show similar downward trends. Increased
production would further reduce costs. 
If pollution and social costs from fossil fuel use were
to be internalized in fossil fuel prices, many
renewables today would be cheaper than fossil fuels. <p>
     At the same time, reliability has improved
markedly, and renewable capacity is expected to grow. A
recent study projects that existing renewable 
technologies could supply roughly one-quarter of our
current energy use by 2010.<p>
     The advancement of wind energy is a convincing
success story. U.S. wind resources are large enough to
supply more than 4.4 billion megawatt-hours
  -  more than 1-1/2 times the total amount of
electricity used in the United States. At least
thirty-seven states have commercial wind energy
potential. The wind industry is producing utility-scale
turbines that are significantly less costly and far more
reliable than earlier generation turbines. Utility
contracts for wind power have been signed recently for a
levelized price of less than 4 cents per kilowatt-hour
 -  competitive with fossil sources and cheaper than
nuclear. Wind has enormous advantages over fossil fuels,
including minimal future costs subject to inflation, and
low operating and maintenance costs. Wind energy is one
of the least costly sources of new electrical generation
and is competitive with new plants fired with 
fossil fuels.<p>
<p>
 <B>Kenetech Corporation.</B> U.S. Windpower, Inc. formed
Kenetech Corporation, based in San Francisco, in 1986 as
a holding company. Kenetech, the world's largest wind
company, has more than 800 employees. It manufactures
and sells one of the most advanced wind turbines in the
world, the variable speed Model 33M-VS. This turbine is
able to deliver electricity at less than 5 cents per
kilowatt-hour, making it economically competitive with
traditional fossil-fuel energy sources. Kenetech
operates an installed base of approximately 4,400 wind
turbines, most of which are in the United States. In
California, Kenetech generated 659,131 megawatt-hours of
electricity in 1993, offsetting 226,082 metric tons of
carbon dioxide emissions that would otherwise have been
generated by California's average mix.<p>
     Photovoltaic (PV) power is another promising
renewable technology. PVs use semiconductor technology
to convert sunlight directly into electricity without
the need for turbines, generators, or any other moving
parts. PV production costs have fallen more than 50-fold
during the last 20 years, and PVs generate power today
at an average cost of 25 to 50 cents per kilowatt-hour
for grid-connected applications. At these prices, PV
applications are mainly cost-effective for off-the-grid
uses in remote locations and for specialized grid
situations where distribution and transmission expansion
costs can be avoided. For example, PV arrays situated at
generating substations to support a utility's
transmission and distribution system, and PV arrays at
residential and commercial centers, have the potential
to manage demand for electricity by shaving utility peak
loads. Overall costs are reduced and carbon emissions
avoided. <P>
 <B>Amoco/Enron Solar.</B> The domestic PV industry
received a boost in January 1995 when Amoco Corp., which
owns Solarex, the largest U.S. manufacturer and marketer
of PV systems, launched a joint venture with Enron
Corp., the nation's largest natural gas company.
Together, they propose to build a $25 million facility
to manufacture PV modules and a $150 million,
100-megawatt PV-powered generating plant in Nevada that
they maintain will be able to sell power profitably for
5.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (escalating at 3 percent
annually over 30 years). Production at the plant  - 
which each year will manufacture large-area,
multijunction amorphous silicon modules with capacity in
excess of 10 megawatts  -  is scheduled to begin in
1996.<P>
<h3>D. Conclusion</h3><p>
<p>
The successes reviewed in this report not only save
dollars and boost economic performance, but also cut
carbon dioxide emissions and reduce the threat of global
climate change. Our nation can grow economically, add
jobs, and become more internationally competitive while
cutting greenhouse gas emissions. <p>
     The task ahead is not simple, however. While the
market has captured many efficiency and renewable energy
successes, a host of market barriers to efficiency
investments persists.  For example, although efficiency
and renewable energy technologies are often cheaper on a
life-cycle basis, their up-front costs are typically
higher than less-efficient products.  Public policies
that provide consumers with life-cycle product
information could help overcome this market failure. 
Similarly, because it takes up-front capital to invest
in improved efficiency, public policies that promote
financing and technical assistance can facilitate
investment.  Although the focus of this report is on
efficiency and renewable energy success stories, given
the market hurdles to efficiency investments, utility
efficiency programs and public policy incentives are
crucial to encourage energy efficiency.  The effects of
tighter environmental regulations and the prospect of
higher fossil energy prices will increasingly make
efficiency investments a prudent pursuit for all
businesses.<p>
     Michael Porter, a professor at the Harvard Business
School, notes that "the underlying cause of sustained
national advantage is improvement and innovation." The
compelling conclusion of the case studies in this
report, coupled with the solid economic, employment,
public health, and pollution-reduction benefits reviewed
in each, support a strategic vision for U.S. energy
policy: Energy efficiency and renewable energy can add
to U.S. prosperity while cutting U.S. carbon dioxide
emissions and reducing the threat of global climate
change.
