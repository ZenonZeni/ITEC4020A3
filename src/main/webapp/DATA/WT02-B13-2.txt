The CGES Comparative Immigration and Integration Program held

its Spring Workshop on Wednesday, April 5, 1995 at the Alumni

House at University of California at Berkeley. Four papers were

presented and discussed by the 18 faculty and students who participated.

<BR>


<H2><A NAME="_Toc347218329">Announcements</A> </H2>


<P>

1. Faculty CIIP awards for 1995-96 will be announced by April

20, 1995. This year's grant letters will include an explicit statement

that faculty receiving CGES-CIIP awards are expected to be active

members of the workgroup. <BR>


<P>

Active members are expected to participate in the Fall and Spring

workshops, to make at least one presentation to the group, and

to submit at least one working paper to Patricia LaHay based on

their CIIP-funded research, each year that they receive a CIIP

award. <BR>


<P>

2. These minutes include the announcement of a Graduate Student

RFP for up to $2000 to be spent between June 15, 1995 and July

1, 1996. Applications from UC graduate students are due by May

7, 1995; awards will be announced by May 25, 1995.<BR>


<P>

3. There will be a special one-day &quot;invitation only&quot;

workshop on recent developments in German immigration and integration

policy on Thursday, August 31, 1995. CIIP faculty and students

who wish to participate should contact Patricia LaHay.<BR>


<P>

4. The CIIP program will expand to include immigration and integration

issues in Asia. The executive committee (Martin, Cornelius, Waldinger)

will be expanded to include a UCB specialist interested in Asian

labor migration.<BR>


<H2><A NAME="_Toc347218330">Minutes</A> </H2>


<P>

Rogers Brubaker (UCLA) discussed &quot;ethnic unmixing&quot; in

Eastern Europe, and emphasized that people can move across borders

(migration), and borders can move across people (various forms

of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;). One of the world's major ethnic

unmixings occurred after WWII, when 12 million Germans returned

to shrunken Germany, and Brubaker is interested in how ethnic

unmixing might occur in the former USSR, where 25 million Russians

live outside Russia, and in Eastern Europe, as e.g., will ethnic

Hungarians in Romania stay there?<BR>


<P>

There are many types of ethnic unmixing, so that the reasons for,

costs of, speed, and volume of migration varies enormously. If

an ethnic-dominated government falls violently in a multi-ethnic

society, than those ethnics most associated with the old government

are most likely to be pushed out quickly, especially if the ethnicity

that causes them problems in one country gives them a welcome

mat elsewhere.<BR>


<P>

Ethnicity can become an economically-valuable good, especially

if a rich country such as Germany offers automatic citizenship

to ethnic nationals who move &quot;home.&quot; The number of &quot;ethnic

Germans&quot; has been increasing in the ex-USSR in response to

the opportunity to emigrate to Germany. However, it was noted

that ethnic unmixing may result in a move from isolation to isolation--the

ethnic Germans in Germany may be thought of there as Russians.

<BR>


<P>

Ethnicity can also increase network access to emigration. Ethnic

Hungarians in Romania, for example, may be better able to migrate

seasonally for employment to Hungary than other Romanians.<BR>


<P>

Philip Martin (UCD) discussed the probable effects of the peso

devaluation on Mexico-to-US migration. As with many US-Mexican

relationships, there is an asymmetry in the migration relationship:

the US accepts immigrants from many nations, but virtually all

Mexican emigrants head for the US. Mexico is expected to send

over 3 million immigrants to the United States over the 15 years

between 1981 and 1995, equivalent to 20 percent of Mexico&iacute;s

net population growth, and 25 percent of legal US immigration.

<BR>


<P>

On January 1, 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)

went into effect, laying the basis for an eventual free trade

area encompassing 380 million people with a combined GDP of $7

trillion. The purpose of NAFTA is to reduce trade barriers and

promote investment in the region, thereby stimulating economic

and job growth throughout North America.<BR>


<P>

Mexico has had major devaluations at the end of each of the last

4 Presidencies: in 1976, in 1982, again in 1986-87, and in 1994-95.

After each de-evaluation, illegal immigration increased, but there

is no consistent relationship between economic troubles in Mexico

and illegal immigration to the US, at least as measured by apprehensions.

For example, after the 1982-83 peso devaluation, it took about

16 months for the US Border Patrol to notice a significant increase

in illegal immigration. In 1987, apprehensions dropped despite

a devaluation of the peso, largely because so many Mexicans were

becoming legalized US immigrants.<BR>


<P>

The economic background and US immigration responses to the first

two peso devaluations may provide clues about responses to the

1994-95 devaluation. The 70 percent peso devaluation of 1982-83

lowered real wages in urban areas and put Mexican farmers in a

cost-price squeeze, but the fact that Mexican workers kept their

jobs and saw their standard of living erode gradually helps to

explain the delayed illegal migration response. The 1986-87 peso

devaluation, by contrast, occurred when the US was offering an

amnesty, while the INS was educating employers rather than enforcing

sanctions, and during a period of rapid US job growth, all factors

that encouraged a seemingly &igrave;legal&icirc; migration response.

<BR>


<P>

The 50 percent peso devaluation of 1994-95 is occurring in a different

climate in Mexico and the US. In Mexico, for the first time, it

appears that there will be significant layoffs from formal sector

jobs --the Mexican government projects that 1 million workers

may be laid off from formal sector jobs, and that 400,000 were

laid off since January 1, 1995. <BR>


<P>

With more urban workers facing unemployment without a safety net,

and most of the relief programs apparently designed to help rural

people--Mexico plans to employ 500,000 workers temporarily to

build and repair rural roads- -poor farmers could be joined in

the northward trek in 1995 by unemployed factory workers. INS

Commissioner Doris Meissner, for example, noted that some of the

Mexican aliens apprehended by INS agents said they crossed the

border because of plant closings or other job losses related to

the peso devaluation.<BR>


<P>

There are three broad options to deal with the increased emigration

pressure in Mexico: develop better border and interior controls

designed to deter Mexican and all other illegal immigrants, try

to convert illegal Mexican migrants into legal guest workers,

and induce Mexico to cooperate to reduce illegal immigration.

<BR>


<P>

Jack Citrin (UCB) discussed the results of opinion polling that

found widespread sentiment for reducing immigration. Elites--better

educated and wealthier people--tend to favor current or higher

levels of immigration; mass opinion favors less immigration. 

<BR>


<P>

There was a remarkable similarity of opinion on immigration regardless

of micro economic circumstances--whether a person was employed

or not, his or her feelings about the need for less immigration

were similar. <BR>


<P>

It was noted that anti-immigrant sentiments seem to be rising

in all aging industrial societies and that, in many countries

with different groups of immigrants, one group--Turks in Germany,

Algerians in France, or Mexicans in the US--seem to typify what

those polled do not like about immigration. <BR>


<P>

Nancy Bolton (UCLA) reported on the results of an ongoing project

that is using state income tax records to study demographic change

in CA. Using returns filed in 1990 and 1993, Bolton and her colleagues

matched via SSNs a sample of persons who filed returns in both

years, and this matching suggests that migration out of CA was

much greater than previously believed--perhaps a net 400,000 residents

left CA in 1990. <BR>


<P>

Tax records overcount households because many individuals living

together file separate tax returns, but they undercount the population

because not all persons are required to file, especially the elderly

with only social security income and those on welfare. However,

there has been a significant increase in tax filings by poor people

with children to obtain the Earned Income Tax Credit--a maximum

$1300 in 1992 if no tax was owed. <BR>


<P>

One noteworthy trend was that non-Hispanics seemed to move out

of CA between 1990 and 1993, while Hispanics moved in. CA's payroll

employment in March 1995 was 12.2 million, up a net 54,000 in

the first 3 months of 1995.<BR>

<P>

Call for Proposals - Deadline, June 1, 1995<BR>


<P>

The Center for German and European Studies announces a competition

for a 

<P>

limited amount of grants of up to $2,000 available to registered

UC 

<P>

graduate students. Grant recipients would be expected to become

active 

<P>

participants in the Comparative Immigration and Integration Program,

a 

<P>

study group which meets two times a year to discuss economic,

political, 

<P>

and socio cultural questions raised by immigration into North

American 

<P>

and Western Europe, and the integration of newcomers into these


<P>

industrial democracies. Funds may be used for research related

travel, 

<P>

supplies and expense, (excluding equipment).

<P>

This Comparative Immigration and Integration Program (CIIP) is

interested 

<P>

in the issues raised by migration from developing nations into

the 

<P>

industrial nations of North America and Western Europe, the adaptation

of 

<P>

newcomers to industrial societies, and the responses of industrial


<P>

country populations to third world immigration. The purpose of

student 

<P>

research grants is to permit students with comparative migration

and 

<P>

integration interests to do further research of this type, and

to enable 

<P>

those with expertise in one area of migration or integration to

develop a 

<P>

comparative perspective in their work.<BR>


<P>

Proposals should indicate whether the questions being addressed

are 

<P>

primarily economic, political, or socio cultural. The CIIP defines

these 

<P>

categories broadly, and does not expect, e.g., only economists

to deal 

<P>

with economic questions. Sociologists and anthropologists interested

in 

<P>

the impact of immigration on native born minority workers, or

on how 

<P>

immigrants fare in ethnic enclave economies, might for example,

also be 

<P>

dealing primarily with economic questions. The CIIP recognizes

that 

<P>

Migration Studies is an inchoate field, and has adopted this three-way


<P>

economic, political, and socio-cultural taxonomy only for administrative


<P>

convenience.<BR>


<P>

Applications should consist of a short description of the proposed


<P>

research, a CV, a budget, and a statement listing the amounts

and sources 

<P>

of other funds that have been received or applied for to support

the 

<P>

proposed research. Berkeley students should submit their applications


<P>

directly to the Center for German and European Studies at the

address 

<P>

below. UC Students at campuses other than Berkeley or UCSD need

to submit 

<P>

their applications through the Contracts and Grants Office at

their home 

<P>

campus, allowing 2 weeks for processing. Please see your departmental


<P>

business officer for instructions and information. Applications

should 

<P>

be received at the following address by June 1, 1995; awards will

be announced in mid-June.<BR>
