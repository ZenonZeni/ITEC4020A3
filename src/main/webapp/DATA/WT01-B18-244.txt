Dear Mr. Olsen:  

     This replies to your May 13, 1993, letter asking several 
questions about drugs.  

     It is true that a good many drugs useful in therapeutics can 
be extracted from herbs.  Some drugs have an animal origin, e.g., 
many hormones.  A synthetic drug is a drug that is made by 
chemically combining various starting materials to make the 
desired product.  The product is then identical in all respects 
to the product isolated from a plant source.  Such a product can 
be marketed under the same name.  For example, cortisone is 
synthesized from a yam that grows in Mexico and it is identical 
to cortisone extracted from adrenal tissue.  

     A synthetic drug would be in the same schedule as its 
naturally occurring twin.  For example, synthetic lysergic acid 
amide is in the same schedule as lysergic acid amide derived from 
the plant source.  

     Please let me know if I can be of further assistance on drug 
matters.  

     Sincerely yours,  

     Harold Davis
