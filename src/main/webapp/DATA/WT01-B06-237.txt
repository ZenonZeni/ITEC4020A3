<A name="production"></A><BR>
<H2>Some General Information:</H2>
<B>Production Cost</B>
<UL>
  <LI>RFG costs more to produce than California 1994 conventional gasoline.
To make California RFG, most refiners must invest in new equipment, add
processing steps and use more expensive blending ingredients. Depending
on the refiner, these steps or changes will increase production costs by
about 5 to 15 cents per gallon (an average of 10 cents). This includes the
additional 2 to 5 cents per gallon needed to make federal Phase I RFG.
  <LI>However, even though RFG will cost more, it makes economic as well
as environmental sense. When compared with other methods of reducing air
pollution, such as additional controls on businesses, RFG is a very cost-effective
way to clean the air.
</UL>
<BR>
<A name="price"></A><BR>
<B>Price at the Pump</B><BR>
The price of gasoline cannot be accurately predicted because it is influenced
by many factors, including production costs, weather, crude oil prices,
and product supply and demand. However, it is expected that increased RFG
production costs will be reflected in the price at the pump.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Facts About Cleaner-burning Gasoline</H2>
<BR><A name="improved"></A><BR>
<B>An Improved Gasoline Formula</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline is an improved gasoline formula that pollutes
less.
  <LI>It is not a new fuel, it is still gasoline.
  <LI>By spring of l996, all Californians will be using cleaner-burning
gasoline.
</UL>
<BR><A name="problem"></A><BR>
<B>California's Air Pollution Problem Continues</B>
<UL>
  <LI>More than 90 percent of Californians breathe unhealthy air.
  <LI>Gasoline-powered vehicles and equipment contribute about half the
pollution that makes California's air among the most polluted in the country.
</UL>
<BR><A name="healthbenefits"></A><BR>
<B>Health Benefits are Significant</B>
<UL>
  <LI>You will have healthier air to breathe. Using cleaner-burning gasoline
lowers emissions of pollutants that cause or contribute to health problems
such as heart and lung disease.
  <LI>Reduces the cancer risk from gasoline emissions by more than one-third.
</UL>
<BR><A name="redux"></A><BR>
<B>Large Emission Reductions</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Provides one of the largest emission reductions in California's long
fight against smog by reducing smog-forming emissions from motor vehicles
by 15 percent. This is equivalent to removing 3.5 million cars from California's
roads and freeways.
  <LI>Immediately reduces more than 3 million pounds a day of unhealthful
air pollutants from vehicles.
</UL>
<BR><A name="change"></A><BR>
<B>No Change in Performance</B>
<UL>
  <LI>You can use cleaner-burning gasoline in your car exactly the same
way as today's gasoline.
  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline works just as well as today's gasoline in
boats, jet skis, garden equipment and other gasoline-powered engines.
  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline will be available in the same octane levels
as current gasoline.
</UL>
<BR><A name="test"></A><BR>
<B>Tested Extensively</B>
<UL>
  <LI>In cooperation with experts representing automobile manufacturers,
gasoline manufacturers, and government, the APB extensively tested cleaner-burning
gasoline in hundreds of vehicles.
  <LI>More than 5 million miles were driven on cleaner-burning gasoline.
This comprehensive test program did not identify any increase in problems
with the use of cleaner-burning gasoline.
  <LI>Many car parts, especially fuel-system components, fail and require
replacement during the normal life of the vehicle. Cleaner-burning gasoline
will not change this.
  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline did not increase problems in fuel systems.
However, testing did show that, on average, vehicles about 10 years old
and older, particularly those with more than 90,000 miles, can experience
a fairly high level of fuel-system problems due to normal wear and tear.
Owners of such vehicles are encouraged to have their fuel-system inspected
and to follow their vehicle manufacturer's recommendations regarding maintenance
of fuel system parts.
</UL>
<BR><A name="mileage"></A><BR>
<B>Gas Mileage</B><BR>
On average, cleaner-burning gasoline may result in a very small (less than
one-half mile per gallon) reduction in gasoline mileage when compared to
the fuel that is currently being used.<BR>
<BR><A name="mileageprice"></A><BR>
<B>Price</B><BR>
Cleaner-burning gasoline costs more to produce. Depending on the refinery,
this increase in production cost varies from 5 to 15 cents per gallon. Gasoline
prices are determined by competitive market forces. The price you will see
at the gasoline pump cannot be accurately predicted. It is expected that
at least some of the increased rest will ultimately be reflected in prices
at the pump.<BR>

saws, and other gasoline-powered engines.
  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline will be available in the same octane levels
as current gasoline.
</UL>
<BR><A name="test"></A><BR>
<B>Has cleaner-burning gasoline been tested?</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Yes. Under the guidance of an Advisory Committee, which includes
experts representing automobile manufacturers, gasoline manufacturers, and
government, the Air Resources Board (ARB) tested the fuel in hundreds of
vehicles and other gasoline-powered equipment. 
  <LI>More than 5 million miles were driven on cleaner-burning gasoline.
This comprehensive program did not identify any increase in problems with
the use of cleaner-burning gasoline.
  <LI>Many car parts, especially fuel-system components, fail and require

to follow their vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for maintenance of
fuel-system parts.
</UL>
<BR><A name="change"></A><BR>
<B>Will I notice any change in gas mileage with cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>
Possibly. On average, cleaner-burning gasoline may result in a very small
(less than one-half mile per gallon) reduction in car mileage from the fuel
that you are currently using. Many factors affect the actual vehicle fuel
economy one may experience. These include driving habits, vehicle condition
and tire pressure. Because of these and other factors, even with the same
gasoline, your mileage can vary by several miles per gallon from one fill-up
to the next.<BR>
<BR><A name="paymore"></A><BR>
<B>Will I have to pay more for cleaner-burning gasoline? </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Possibly. Cleaner-burning gasoline costs more to produce. Depending
on the refinery, this increase in production cost varies from 5 to 15 cents
per gallon. However, the price you will see at the pump cannot be accurately
predicted. 
  <LI>The price of cleaner-burning gasoline is subject to and will be determined
by competitive forces in the marketplace. Many factors including production
costs, weather, crude oil prices, taxes and supply and demand affect gasoline
prices. 
  <LI>It is expected that at least some of the increased cost to make cleaner-burning
gasoline will be reflected in prices at the pump.
</UL>
<BR><A name="ingredients"></A><BR>
<B>What's in cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>All gasoline is made from a recipe of basic ingredients. Cleaner-burning
gasoline is composed of these same basic ingredients, but is less polluting
because the recipe requires more cleaner-burning components and fewer toxic
compounds.<BR>
<LI>The general cleaner-burning gasoline recipe:
<UL>
  <LI>Reduces benzene (a known human carcinogen) in gasoline by one-half
  <LI>Lowers the amount of fuel that evaporates from your vehicle;
  <LI>Reduces the amount of sulfur in gasoline by 80 percent, which allows
your vehicle catalyst to perform more effectively;
  <LI>Reduces aromatic hydrocarbons, a part of gasoline that contributes
to smog-forming emissions; and
  <LI>Adds oxygen-containing compounds, which allow gasoline to burn more
completely in your engine. Oxygenates have been added to gasoline since
the mid-1970s to enhance octane.
</UL></UL>
<BR><A name="diff"></A><BR>
<B>Will using cleaner-burning gasoline really make a difference?</B><BR>
Yes. It is equivalent to leaving your car at home one day a week.<BR>
<BR>
<A name="toxic"></A><BR>
<B>Is cleaner-burning gasoline toxic?</B><BR>
Yes. Cleaner-burning gasoline reduces emissions and exposure to toxic substances,
which result from the evaporation and combustion of gasoline. Although using
cleaner-burning gasoline reduces emissions of smog-forming and toxic pollutants,
like conventional gasoline, cleaner-burning gasoline is a hazardous substance.
You should continue to take precautions to avoid exposure to gasoline vapors
when pumping and handling any gasoline. You should never swallow or siphon
any gasoline.<BR>
<BR><A name="reg"></A><BR>
<B>Does the State regulate the price of gasoline?</B><BR>
No.<BR>
<BR><A name="whyrequire"></A><BR>
<B>Why did the State require cleaner-burning gasoline if it may cost more
at the pump?</B>
<UL>
  <LI>Healthier air is worth it. Cleaner-burning gasoline is one of the
least costly remaining ways to reduce emissions of pollutants into our air.
Its use will immediately reduce more than 3 million pounds of pollution
from being released to the air each day.
  <LI>Cleaner-burning gasoline is one of the most significant measures
needed to help California meet state and federal health standards for air
quality.
</UL>
<BR><A name="automfg"></A><BR>
<B>Do automobile manufacturers recommend using cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>
Yes. Automobile manufacturers participated in the development of the specifications
for cleaner-burning gasoline and recommend its use in their vehicles.<BR>
<BR><A name="warranty"></A><BR>
<B>Will using cleaner-burning gasoline affect my vehicle's warranty?</B><BR>
No.<BR>
<BR><A name="anychanges"></A><BR>
<B>Will I have to make any changes in order to use cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>
No. You can use cleaner-burning gasoline in exactly the same way as the
gasoline you are currently using. The same applies to boats, jet skis, garden
equipment, chainsaws and other gasoline-burning engines. It will be available
in the same octane ratings as current gasoline.<BR>
<BR><A name="extensive"></A><BR>
<B>How extensive was the testing program?</B>
<UL>
  <LI>The ARB and industry experts conducted a comprehensive 6-month testing
program. Hundreds of vehicles, as well as other gasoline-powered equipment,
used cleaner-burning gasoline during this program. More than 5 million miles
were driven on cleaner-burning gasoline.
  <LI>As part of this testing program, more than 800 vehicles from several
fleets, including Bank of America, GTE California, Pacific Bell, CalTrans,
the City and County of Sacramento and California State University, Fresno,
were tested on cleaner-burning gasoline. Cleaner-burning gasoline was also
tested on a broad range of other gasoline-burning equipment, including lawnmowers,
tractors, leaf blowers, edgers, forklifts, snowmobiles, motorcycles, jet
skis and marine pleasure craft.
</UL>
<BR><A name="oneway"></A><BR>
<B>Is there just one way to make cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>
No. Gasoline manufacturers will be making their own decisions on their
recipe for cleaner-burning gasoline. Though individual gasolines may vary,
all gasoline produced for sale in California after spring of 1996 will be
cleaner-burning gasoline.<BR>
<BR><A name="1996"></A><BR>
<B>Is there a program to ensure that all gasoline produced in California
after the spring of 1996 is cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>
Yes. The State has a comprehensive compliance program to ensure all of
the gasoline produced for sale in California after spring of 1996 is cleaner-burning
gasoline.<BR>
<BR><A name="mtbe"></A><BR>
<B>What is methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and why is it used?</B><BR>
MTBE is an oxygenate that helps gasoline burn more completely. Federal
law requires that most gasoline in California contain oxygenates. MTBE is
the oxygenate that most gasoline manufacturers choose to use.<BR>
<BR><A name="new"></A><BR>
<B>Is MTBE something new?</B><BR>
No. MTBE has been used in gasoline since the mid-70s. In 1995, about 9
billion gallons of oxygenated gasoline were used in California, the majority
of which contained MTBE.<BR>
<BR><A name="oxygenate"></A><BR>
<B>Is MTBE the only oxygenate that can be used in cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>
No. MTBE is one of several possible oxygenates expected to be used by gasoline
manufacturers to produce cleaner-burning gasoline. MTBE is expected to continue
to be the most widely used oxygenate in California. Other oxygenates expected
to be used are ethanol and ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE).<BR>
<BR><A name="mtbeknown"></A><BR>
<B>What is known about MTBE and health?</B><BR>
In some states there were complaints of nausea and headaches possibly being
associated with MTBE. However, recent health studies have found no association
between MTBE and these complaints. California health experts are continuing
to monitor other MTBE health studies that are currently being conducted.<BR>
<BR><A name="smell"></A><BR>
<B>Does cleaner-burning gasoline smell different from conventional gasoline?</B>
<UL>
  <LI>No.  Cleaner-burning gasoline is not expected to smell different
than the gasoline that most people are currently using. If an odor is noticed,
it is probably from oxygenates, usually MTBE.
  <LI>Most gasoline service stations in California use vapor recovery systems
to minimize the exposure of motorists and service-station personnel to gasoline
odors and fumes while refueling.
</UL>
<BR><A name="who"></A><BR>
<B>Who developed cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>
The specifications for cleaner-burning gasoline were developed by ARB engineers
and scientists in consultation with gasoline and automobile manufacturers
and others. Data from thousands of vehicle tests were used to develop the
specifications.<BR>
<BR><A name="supply"></A><BR>
<B>Will there be adequate supplies of cleaner-burning gasoline? </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Yes, Cleaner-burning gasoline will be available in California to
meet the demand. However, as we have experienced in the past, it is possible
that unusual conditions could lead to a temporary disruption in die fuel
supply.
  <LI>The State has worked extensively with gasoline manufacturers and
distributors to ensure that adequate supplies of cleaner-burning gasoline
are produced and distributed. A mechanism to help ensure adequate supplies
in unusual conditions is in place and ready if needed.
</UL>
<BR><A name="future"></A><BR>
<B>What if we need to use more gasoline in the future?</B><BR>
As in the past, we expect the market will adjust to meet demand.<BR>
<BR><A name="california"></A><BR>
<B>Is cleaner-burning gasoline the only thing that California is doing to
make the air cleaner?</B><BR>
Cleaner-burning gasoline is only one part of a wide range of programs to
improve air quality in California. Other programs include efforts to clean
up cars, trucks, buses, factories, consumer products and other sources.
These programs benefit all Californians by helping to clean the air. In
addition to the above efforts, there are a number of steps that people can
take to reduce air pollution. These include: properly maintaining their
vehicle, car pooling and planning trips to avoid bumper-to-bumper traffic.<BR>
<BR><A name="cleanerair"></A><BR>
<B>Will I see cleaner air with cleaner-burning gasoline?</B><BR>
White cleaner-burning gasoline is an important component of our program
to provide healthy air for Californians, it will not single-handedly eliminate
California's air pollution problem. However, cleaner-burning gasoline in
combination with other programs will lead to reduced levels of air pollution
and therefore better air quality.<BR>
