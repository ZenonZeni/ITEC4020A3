     the call or initiated the communication; or

       ``(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility

     restrictions on access, judicial remedies respecting 
     restrictions for persons providing information services and 
     access to information services--

        (1) No person shall be held to have violated subsections (a),
     (d), or (e) solely for providing access or connection to or
     from a facility, system, or network over which that person
     has no control, including related capabilities which are
     incidental to providing access or connection.  This subsection
     shall not be applicatable to an individual who is owned or
     controlled by, or a conspirator with, an entity actively
     involved in the creation, editing or knowing distribution of
     communications which violate this section.

        (2) No employer shall be held liable under this section for
     the actions of an employee or agent unless the employee's or
     agent's conduct is within the scope of his employment or agency
     and the employer has knowledge of, authorizes, or ratifies the
     employee's or agent's conduct.

        (3) It is a defense to prosecution under subsection (a), (d)(2),
     or (e) that a person has taken reasonable, effective and
     appropriate actions in good faith to restrict or prevent the
     transmission of or access to a communication specified in such
     subsections, or complied with procedures as the Commission may
     prescribe in furtherance of this section.  Until such regulations
     become effective, it is a defense to prosecution that the person 
     has complied with the procedures prescribed by regulation pursuant
     to subsection (b)(3).  Nothing in this subsection shall be
     construed to treat enhanced information services as common
     carriage.

        (4) No cause of action may be brought in any 
     court or any administrative agency against any person on account 
     of any action which in not in violation of any law punishable
     by criminal penalty, which activity the person has taken in good
     faith to implement a defense authorized under this section or
     otherwise to restrict or prevent the transmission of, or access to,
     a communication specified in this section.

         (g) no state or local government may impose any liability 
     for commercial activities or actions by commercial entities in
     connection with an activity or action which constitutes a violation
     described in subsection (a)(2), (d)(2), or (e)(2) that is
     inconsistent with the treatment of those activities or actions
     under this section provided, however, that nothin herein shall
     preclude any State or local government from enacting and enforcing 
     complementary oversight, liability, and regulatory systems, 
     procedures, and requirements so long as such systems, procedures,
     and requirements govern only intrastate services and do not result
     in the imposition of inconsistent rights, duties or obligations on 
     the provision of interstate services.  Nothing in this subsection
     shall preclude any State or local government from governing conduct
     not covered by this section.

         (h) Nothing in subsection (a), (d), (e), or (f) or in the
     defenses to prosecution under (a), (d), or (e) shall be construed
     to affect or limit the application or enforcement of any other
     Federal law.

         (i) The use of the term 'telecommunications device' in this
     section shall not impose new obligations on (one-way) broadcast
     radio or (one-way) broadcast television operators licensed by the
     Commission or (one-way) cable services registered with the
     Federal Communications Commission and covered by obscenity and
     indecency provisions elsewhere in this Act.

         (j) Within two years from the date of enactment and every two
     years thereafter, the Commission shall report on the effectiveness
     of this section.
