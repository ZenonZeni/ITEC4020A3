Much of the research we carry out in CSIRO is made possible by systematic
collections of spatially referenced information. These data sets frequently
have long-term value, for applications which may not have been apparent
at the time of commencement of the research projects which generated them.<BR>
<BR>
Data sets generated by one Division or research project may have value to
other parts of the Organisation, to other Australian agencies, or to foreign
organisations. Therefore, provided the existence of research data collections
is known, they may be utilised as national or global information resources
which can be expanded and checked. Timely access to existing research data
sets may decrease the current costs of research, and may increase the measurement
period (and possibly the accuracy) for some experiments.<BR>
<BR>
I am writing to inform you of several exciting developments in the management
of spatially-referenced information (Attachment 1). Many of these advances
originated in space programs, where the unit cost of data is often very
high and measurements may be not easily repeatable. Other breakthroughs
have originated at the public policy level, or from integration of several
technologies, including the Internet, data visualisation, and database design.<BR>
<BR>
The net effect is to make it easier to locate, browse, select and transfer
information held at distributed sites. This capacity is of special value
for fusing multi-disciplinary datasets relating to the same geographic location,
and for datasets which are expensive or which need specialised storage facilities.
<BR>
<BR>
If you find this work to be relevant to your Division's current or planned
research, I would encourage you to contact me for further information. <BR>
