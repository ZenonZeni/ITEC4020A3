<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  &#167;   Cavallo's latest accusations of corruption in
the Menem administration no longer have the potential to derail economic policy,
but they could damage prospects for continued reform after next year's mid- term
elections.  &#167;  The administration has brought its labor reform legislation
to congress, presenting changes to union-run social services and inserting a
grandfather clause into a proposed severance pay reform to ease the bill's
passage. &#167; Chile's largest forestry company, Celco, has bought Argentine
pulp maker Alto Parana for a hefty $270 million.  Page 2 </P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   Proposed changes to tax laws would make it harder
for corporations to avoid taxes through  accounting sleights-of-hand like over-
and under-reporting transactions and transfer pricing.  &#167;   Leftist parties
have emerged from early-October municipal elections with a majority, but a
second round in 14 state capitals November 15 will clarify the new balance of
power further.  Page 3</P>
<P><B>CHILE</B>  &#167;  Inversora Andina's lone low bid for the Colbun
hydroelectric plant is a symptom of structural  problems in Chile's electric
utilities: unresolved regulatory issues and expected pressure on profit margins
from competing natural gas projects.  &#167;  Civil servants are mounting an
unusually intense rash of strikes and protests ahead of annual pay negotiations.

<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   Central bank officials are refusing to cave under
to pressure from export sectors and the  government to change the exchange band
to allow the peso to weaken more quickly against the dollar. &#167; Conceding to
striking truck drivers only half of the transport-fee increase they had
demanded, the government took a hard line, declaring their week-long strike
illegal and threatening fines.  &#167;  The government is threatening to crack
down on suspected textile dumping by Asian and other nations.  Page 5</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B>  &#167;  The Zedillo administration might have been able to
save itself from defeat on petrochemical  privatizations had it and earlier
administrations followed the tack taken by Argentina and other Latin American
countries that successfully privatized strategic sectors: presenting a
compelling public argument about the merits of selling state enterprises.  Page

<P><B>PERU</B>  &#167;   As the privatization of electric utility Luz del Sur
approaches, authorities are trying to rescue the image  of the citizen share
participation program with an aggressive sales campaign and promises of
plentiful shares. &#167; A consortium headed by Spain's Endesa, which is
aggressively expanding in Latin America, bought a majority stake in Empresa
Electrica de Piura.  &#167;  President Fujimori's congressional majority has
shot down a referendum that threatened his re-election bid.  Page 7</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA  </B> &#167;   The local business community is blasting the
growth strategy embraced by the administration, saying it relies too heavily on
the oil sector and foreign investment at the expense of local commerce.  &#167; 
State governors are lobbying for a larger share of the oil profits they see
materializing from a boom in foreign investment. &#167; The government has set
tentative privatization dates for three key banks and is still targeting late
November for the much-anticipated sale of CANTV shares.  Page 8</P>
<P><B>TELECOM REPORT/BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   The upcoming auctioning of B-band
cellular licenses is losing its once- great attraction. International
telecommunications companies worry they will be hobbled by local A-band
operators under the wing of Telebras who are already busily gobbling market
potential and by possible onerous requirements to be set by the federal phone
monopoly. Other communications business, like data transmission and Internet
access, offer faster returns and less bureaucracy.  Pages 9-10</P>

<H1>Investors Lose Interest In Cellular Licenses, Eye Data Transmission</H1>
<P>International telecommunications companies are less enthusiastic than
expected about the upcoming sale of licenses to provide B-band cellular services
in Brazil, but they are very interested in other services, such as data
transmission.</P>
<P>&quot;Companies are re-evaluating their strategies because they don't see a
return on their investment for seven to 10 years, and they will have to invest
half a billion to a billion dollars or more. Their shareholders won't stand for
that,&quot; said Grier Raclin, an attorney who advises the Brazilian government
and multinationals on telecom munications issues in Brazil.</P>
<P>Speaking at a Brazilian telecommunications conference in Miami organized by
the New York-based World Research Group, Jose Luis Oliveira de Souza, director
of Stelar Telecom, said, &quot;The government expects to raise $4 billion from
the sale of cellular licenses. I don't know where that money is going to come
from. The licenses aren't worth that much.&quot; Stelar Telecom, which plans to
bid for a license, is a member of Brazil's huge Odebrecht group.</P>
<P><B><I>Schedule Pending. </I></B>The government is to announce its schedule
for the sale of B-band cellular licenses on October 28, when it is supposed to
send a proposal for major telecommunications legislation to congress.
Subsidiaries of Telebras, the government holding company for the
telecommunications sector, already offer A-band cellular services throughout
much of Brazil. B-band operators will compete with them.</P>
<P>Paulo Roberto Cordeiro, the congressman who will manage the bill's passage
through the lower house, said the government plans to issue documents for
bidding on the licenses in early November, and choose winners in first half
1997.</P>
<P><B>A-Band Expansion.</B> Raclin, a managing partner in Washington of the
Gardner, Carton &amp; Douglas law firm, said one reason for lack of interest in
B-band licenses is that A-band operators are quickly expanding their networks.
Their intent is to control as much of the market as possible before the private
sector is allowed in.</P>
<P>For instance, according to Oliveira de Souza's data, Sao Paulo
telecommunications company Telesp will increase the number of cellular lines in
metropolitan Sao Paulo from 410,000 to 940,000 in 1997. In the interior of Sao
Paulo state, the number will rise from 585,000 to 1.1 million. In Rio de
Janeiro/Espirito Santo, the increase will be from 169,000 to 579,000 cellular
lines. Oliveira de Souza predicted that by the time B-band providers begin
operations, likely around mid 1998, the waiting list for cellular access will
have virtually disappeared, though there will still be demand for fixed lines. &quot;There
is no waiting list for cellular lines now in the North, the Northeast, the Mid
West and a good part of the South,&quot; he said.</P>
<P><B>Infrastructure Gaps.</B> Raclin and Oliveira de Souza agreed a major
issue facing new B-band operators is that they will be unable to quickly develop
their networks because of the shortage in Brazil of equipment, services and
expertise. &quot;The A-band operators have a two-year head start. They are going
to dominate the cellular phone business for six or seven years,&quot; Raclin
said. Oliveira de Souza said, &quot;The longer it takes for the government to
award the licenses, the less they are worth. By the time we get into the market,
we will almost have to pay for a subscriber.&quot;</P>
<P><B>Onerous Connection Fees. </B>Another big headache is that B-band
operators will have to pay a long-distance connection fee to Embratel, the
monopoly, state-owned longdistance provider. And they will have to pay for
equipment to make the connection. A-band operators don't pay the connection fee.
More importantly, Embratel, which is a Telebras subsidiary, has refused to say
how much the fee will be or what equipment will be necessary. </P>
<P><B>Information Gap.</B> &quot;The consortia that are considering bids are
furious with Telebras, because it won't talk about interconnectivity, so they
can't value their bids,&quot; Raclin said. Oliveira de Souza complained that
valuing bids is further complicated by the uncertainty surround ing the future
of A-band cellular providers. Under legislation passed this year, Telebras'
subsidiaries still have exclusive concessions to run A-band services. However,
they must have their A-band operations up and running within two years and
establish separate divisions, which may join with private capital, to control
them. The legislation also authorizes their privatization.  &quot;There is no
projection as to when they will be privatized,&quot; said Oliveira de Souza. &quot;That's
an important piece of information we should know before we make our bid.&quot;</P>
<P><B>Ten Regional Licenses. </B>The government is expected to divide the
country into 10 regions and issue one license for each. Although the final
decision is to be announced on October 28, Oliveira de Souza said it was 95%
certain the country would be divided into:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Metropolitan Sao Paulo
</LI>
<LI>Interior of the state of Sao Paulo
</LI>
<LI>Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo
</LI>
<LI>Minas Gerais
</LI>
<LI>Parana and Santa Catarina
</LI>
<LI>Rio Grande do Sul
</LI>
<LI>Mid West (Goias, Tocantins, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, Rondonia, Acre
and the Federal District)
</LI>
<LI>North (Amazonas, Roraima, Amapa, Para and Maranhao)
</LI>
<LI>Bahia and Sergipe
</LI>
<LI>Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco and Alagoas.
</LI></UL>
<P>Oliveiro de Souza argues that some licenses will be virtually worthless. &quot;Some
areas don't look viable,&quot; he said. For instance, the Amazon region covers
almost half Brazil but generates only 4% of the country's GDP. He estimated the
deployment of B-band cellular services throughout Brazil would cost $5 billion -
$7 billion over three years, not including the cost of licenses.</P>
<P><B>Who Will Bid? </B>Thierry Van Nieuwenhove, the First National Bank of
Boston analyst for Brazilian telecom munications, said several major
telecommunications companies, such as NYNEX, Sprint and MCI, would not bid
because of the problems surrounding B-band licenses. But they are interested in
investing in A-band operators when they are privatized.</P>
<P><B>Beyond Cellular Networks. </B>Raclin said telecom com panies are looking
beyond the cellular networks to services where growth will be much faster. He
said the ministry of communications goals include a 258% increase in cellular
lines to 17.2 million lines by the year 2003. In comparison, the goal for data
communication services is to increase 544% to 16.1 million users, pay TV is to
rise 725% to 16.5 million subscribers, paging services are to expand 457% to 3.9
million subscribers, and trunking facilities are to increase 700% to 800,000
accesses. &quot;Investment &#150; and return on investment &#150; in these other
market segments is projected to be relatively far greater than in the cellular
telephone sector,&quot; Raclin said. &quot;This is what is attracting the
attention of entre preneurs in Brazil, not so much the ?great opportunity' to
bid somewhere between half a billion and a billion dollars for Sao Paulo.&quot;</P>
<P>Raclin said companies are particularly interested in &quot;limited service&quot;
and &quot;value-added&quot; service. The law governing these services, nicknamed
the &quot;Lei Minima,&quot; stipulates that authorization to provide &quot;limited
service,&quot; which is also known as private radio, can be given without
bidding. Companies typically use &quot;limited service&quot; for internal
communications, but the law allows for its use by a group of companies without
defining how large the group can be. &quot;A number of companies are looking at
this market as a very cheap way of providing cellular service,&quot; Raclin
said. </P>
<P><B>The Internet. </B>&quot;Value-added&quot; service, essentially data
communication and Internet access, is attracting the attention of large
telecommunications companies. Because the area is unregulated, interconnection
with existing telecom providers is guaranteed, and equipment costs are minimal.
Operators in this area can provide service immediately rather than be delayed
6-18 months to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a cellular system. &quot;It
is a much smaller play, but a return on-investment calculation indicates the
best bets are in data growth and Internet-access growth,&quot; Raclin said.</P>
