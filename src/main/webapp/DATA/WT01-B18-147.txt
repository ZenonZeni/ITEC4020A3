<H3>What Are the Limitations on Foundation Grants?</H3>
<ul>
    <li>   The foundation makes grants to nonprofit charitable organizations classified as 501(c)(3) public charities by the Internal
       Revenue Service. The foundation does not support individuals or for-profit organizations.
    <li>   The foundation does not support local projects, unless they have been consciously designed for further replication or have broad
       regional or national implications. The foundation's geographic focus is the United States, with special emphasis on regional initiatives.

    <li>   The foundation does not make grants intended to support candidates for political office, to influence legislation, or to support 
       sectarian or religious purposes.
    <li>   The foundation does not fund the research and development of technology (e.g., funds to develop hybrid automobiles or
       commercialization of an invention).
    <li>   The foundation does not fund demonstration projects (e.g., model solar homes).

    <li>   The foundation does not fund community energy projects.
    <li>   The foundation does not fund endowments or debt reduction, nor does it make general-support grants. The foundation does
      not support annual fund-raising campaigns or capital construction. The foundation does not support the planning, 
      renovation, maintenance, retrofit, or purchase of buildings; the purchase of equipment; or the acquisition of land, even if the
      intent is to save energy.
</ul>

<H3>How to Apply for a Grant</H3>
    Because the foundation's funding priorities are specialized, we recommend that all applicants carefully review these guidelines. If
    you are not sure whether your project fits the guidelines, we encourage you to write a brief letter of inquiry describing the project,
    its purpose, and the amount you are requesting. We will notify you if a full proposal is warranted.

     If you are confident that your project fits within the guidelines, we do not require a letter of inquiry. Please send us the applica-
     tion form (last page), one copy of your proposal, and the supporting documents listed below.

<H3>The Proposal</H3>
     We have no fixed format for proposals. Use the form that best conveys the strengths of your project.
     In general, a complete proposal includes the following:
<ul>
    <li>   the attached application form as a cover sheet
    <li>   a clear statement of the need(s) or problem(s) to be addressed
    <li>   target decision-maker(s)
    <li>   strategy
    <li>   timeline
    <li>   results you expect from your project
    <li>   project budget - including a brief explanation of the budget, a list of other sources of actual and potential funding for the 
           project, and a description of plans to secure additional funding
    <li>   how you will determine whether your project is successful
    <li>   history of organization, including mission and goals
</ul>

<H3>Supporting Documents</H3>
    To consider a proposal for funding, we need the following documents:
<ul>
    <li>   organization budget
    <li>   most recent audited financial statements
    <li>   IRS letter certifying tax-exempt status
    <li>   current annual report
    <li>   list of board of directors and officers
    <li>   resumes of key personnel involved in project
</ul>

<H3>Deadlines</H3>
    The foundation's Board of Directors meets three times a year (the first week of March, the last week of June, and the first week of
    November). We accept proposals on a continuous basis. There are no specific deadlines. However, in order to consider a proposal
    for inclusion in a specific docket, we need to receive proposals approximately twelve weeks in advance of the next board 
    meeting. Please keep in mind that it takes approximately four weeks to review proposals and inquiries and to contact you with a
    response.
