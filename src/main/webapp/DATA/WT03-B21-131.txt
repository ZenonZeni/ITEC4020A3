				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Mineral Hill underground mine lies in the Beartooth Mountains of Montana in the United States, eight kilometres northeast of Gardiner and 90 kilometres south of Livingston. The wooded property, which covers approximately 6,500 hectares, ranges in elevation from 1,900 to 3,000 metres above sea level. In 1995, the mine produced 34,900 ounces of gold at a cash cost of $359 per ounce compared to 39,300 ounces at a cash cost of $321 in 1994.</B>

		<P><IMG SRC="/images/MineralHill3.jpg" ALT="Mineral Hill Mine" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=157 BORDER=0 ALIGN=RIGHT>Lower grades, a shortfall of tonnage milled and additional development costs in accessing the ore zones on the 1,000 and 1,300-metre levels were responsible for the lower production and higher costs.
<P>TVX Gold has owned a 100% interest in the Mineral Hill mine since October 31, 1993, when it acquired the 50% interest previously held by Homestake Mining Company of California.
<P>Proven and probable ore reserves in the Mineral Hill deposit were estimated at December 31, 1995 to contain 287,000 ounces of gold. When the Mineral Hill deposit began production in September 1989, its reserves contained 350,000 ounces of gold. By the end of 1995, the mine had produced over 253,100 ounces of gold. Exploration of the new Ski Slope zone, discovered in 1995 half a kilometre down dip from the Mineral Hill ore zone, was very successful adding approximately 50,000 ounces of gold to reserves. The Crevice Mountain deposit is also expected to yield more ore when underground exploration and development begin. Additional mineralization in the area represents future exploration potential.
<P>The Mineral Hill orebody is a stratiform deposit which occurs within Archean metasediments, in banded iron formation, biotite schists and in quartz lenses and boudins within the biotite schists. Gold mineralization, associated with sulphides and occurring as free gold, is accompanied primarily by arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite and scheelite.
<P>The Crevice Mountain orebody sits within the same group of metagreywacke rocks as Mineral Hill, and consists of numerous sub-parallel quartz lenses. Gold occurs predominantly in free form within the quartz, and is accompanied primarily by arsenopyrite and pyrite.
<P>Access to the Mineral Hill mine is from four adits. Mining is carried out seven days a week using a combination of cut-and-fill and room-and-pillar methods. Most of the waste rock mined to access the ore is used as backflll.
<P>Ore from the mine is treated at the on-site mill which uses the cyanide leach Merrill-Crowe zinc precipitation process to recover gold. During 1995, mill capacity was increased from 500 tonnes to 600 tonnes per day by increasing thickening and filtering capacity. A gravity feed circuit will also be incorporated into the process in 1996 which is expected to reduce the requirement for reagent supplies substantially, and hence decrease milling costs.
<P>About 30% of the 4.3-kilometre access tunnel being driven from the Mineral Hill mine to the Crevice Mountain deposit had been completed by the end of 1995, unexpected groundwater having slowed progress. The tunnel which was begun in October 1994, is now expected to reach its target in early 1997. The estimated cost of the Crevice Mountain project is $14 million.
<P>Development of the Ski Slope project began in August 1995. By the end of 1995, the access ramp had been driven 220 metres towards its target length of 1,000 metres. The project will cost an estimated $2 million.
<P>Mineral Hill's total production for 1996 is planned at 40,000 ounces of gold.
