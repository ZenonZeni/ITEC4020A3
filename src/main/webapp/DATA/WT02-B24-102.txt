<h1>Knowledge of
Self:<br>
The Key to Self-Esteem and Self Advocacy</h1>
<p><b>Larry B. Silver M.D.</b>
 
<p>At the time a student is diagnosed as having a learning disability, there are
certain givens. Two of these are the areas of learning disabilities and the
intellectual potential of the individual. There are also other factors that
greatly influence the progression and outcome of this student's educational
experiences: how early the disabilities are identified; how comprehensive the
special education interventions provided are; and whether these interventions
are provided, as needed, throughout the student's education. There is yet
another factor that is less easy to identify and measure but critical: the
student's personality. Does he or she take on the disabilities as a challenge,
understand the need to work at overcoming the disabilities and to work at
developing coping strategies? Does she or he relate in a way that makes people
want to reach out and help or in a way that pushes people away?

<p>We know what is needed to help a student with a learning disability succeed.
Efforts must be made to recognize students with academic difficulties and to
identify if they have a learning disability as early as possible. Once
diagnosed, individualized, appropriate, and comprehensive services are
essential throughout each year such services are needed. Educational systems
all too often fail because such known concepts are not practiced. Children and
adolescents are not identified and diagnosed early. Some are not identified
until middle school or high school or are missed completely. Services might be
provided in grade school then, whether needed or not, they are decreased or
stopped in middle school or high school.

<p>Other chapters (of this book) will emphasize the need for early identification
and comprehensive interventions. In this chapter, I would like to address an
equally critical issue if the student with a learning disability is to succeed
though high school and is prepared to move successfully into his or her
post-secondary world. <b>I refer to the student's feelings about himself or
herself and to the student's ability to learn to advocate for his or her
special needs</b>. Critical to the development of a positive self-image and a
good feeling of self-esteem and to the ability to learn to be one's own
advocate is the knowledge of self. Knowledge of self is the key to acceptance
of self, self esteem, and self advocacy. Only with a sense of positive
self-esteem can an individual see himself or herself as a human among humans,
as an equal among equals.

<p><b>THE OTHER SIDE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION: TEACHING KNOWLEDGE OF
SELF</b><br>
Students finishing high school need self-esteem and self-confidence to feel
comfortable and safe when moving out into their post secondary world. Once in
this world, they will need social confidence and social skills to adapt and to
fit in. Of equal importance, individuals will need the knowledge and skills to
both qualify for and to succeed in this next phase of their life, whether it
is to be as a partner in a relationship or in the job market, a trade school,
the military, or college.

<p>What about students with learning disabilities? Are their needs any different?
<b>We know that learning disabilities are <i>life</i> disabilities</b>. They
not only impact on reading, writing, math, and other academic areas, they
impact on all aspects of life, within the family, with peers, in sports and in
activities. Thus, they impact on an individual's success in school. within the
family, and with peers. <b>We also know that learning disabilities are <i>life
time disabilities</i></b>. That is, the child with a learning disability will
become the adolescent with a learning disability will become the adult with a
learning disability. All efforts to help must be provided throughout grade
school, middle school, high school, and into their post secondary world.

<p>Thus, for the student with a learning disability, the need for self-esteem and
self-confidence, the need for social confidence and social skills, and the
need for understanding of self are of even greater importance. Key to
competence with these traits and skills is the individual's total
understanding of his or her learning disabilities and learning abilities as
well as the best strategies for success when with peers, in a work setting, or
in the classroom. With this knowledge, he or she can build a healthy, positive
self esteem. With this knowledge, she or he can become successful self
advocates.

<p>Ideally, students with learning disabilities are identified early in their
school experiences. Each receives the needed special education and related
services throughout their education. Thus, each succeeds in mastering basic
academic skills or in learning to accommodate for any difficulties and each
learns their own unique set of strategies for learning. In addition, each
student learns his or her areas of learning disabilities and learning
abilities. Further, as each student moves from grade school to middle school,
he or she has learned to understand what special accommodations are necessary
and how to advocate for these accommodations both in school and out of school.
By high school, each student not only knows what is needed, but learns to be
assertive as a self advocate.

<p>Ideally, each family of a student with a learning disability is educated about
their son's or daughter's learning disabilities and learning abilities. They,
too, learn what is needed and how to be an informed and assertive advocate for
their child. As this child becomes older, they learn to help him or her begin
to take over some of the advocacy roles so that by high school he or she can
comfortably accept the role of advocate. This family, with knowledge of their
son's or daughter's strengths and weaknesses, knows how to select home
activities, peer activities, sports, and other important experiences for this
son or daughter that build on the strengths while compensating for and
minimizing the effect of the weaknesses. Ideally, therefore, each student has
had successful experiences in the family and with peers. Each individual has
had a happy and successful childhood and adolescence.
Under these ideal conditions, this student would leave high school with
comprehensive self knowledge, good self-esteem, and the ability to self
advocate. He or she would feel good about self and feel both confident and
capable of peer relationships. This student would move into any post secondary
world with the maximum chance for success.

<p>Unfortunately, most school systems do not provide this ideal world. Most
families are not fortunate enough to be taught what they need to how to be
successful parents and siblings. All too many high school graduates do not
have adequate knowledge of self with a resulting low self-esteem and limited
self advocacy skills. Too many high school students give up and either drop
out of school or enter their post secondary world neither psychologically,
socially, nor academically prepared. They are forced to pay the price of a
lifetime of underachievement often along with few personal or social
successes.

<p>Let me illustrate these important concepts by reviewing the stories of a
student with learning disabilities who succeeded and one who did not. 

<p>Marie was first identified as having a learning disability in tenth grade.
prior to this time she had been told by teachers and parents that she was just
lazy and unmotivated. She often was punished for not getting good school
grades or for lying about her school work. Marie was quiet and shy in school
and appeared to avoid relationships. At home, she let out her frustration by
being angry and by fighting with her two siblings.

<p>She was referred for psychiatric treatment because of her aggressive behavior
at home and her "unwillingness" to try in school. During the initial
evaluation, the evidence of a probable learning disability was noted.
Comprehensive psycho-educational testing showed her to be very bright but with
significant learning disabilities, primarily in the visual perception,
sequencing, organization, visual short-term memory, fine motor, and written
language areas. She had excellent strengths in all receptive and expressive
language areas. The initial interventions with Marie focused on explaining her
learning disabilities and learning abilities as well as on what would be
needed for her to succeed. The same information was reviewed later in sessions
with her parents followed by sessions with her family. She started special
education tutoring. Her regular education teachers were informed of the needed
classroom and curriculum accommodations.

<p>Once these efforts were in place, Marie shifted to individual psychotherapy.
She was depressed, had a poor self image and low self esteem. In addition, she
was angry that she had had to struggle and suffer for so many years before
someone found out what was wrong. Once she was able to work through these
issues, she became free to learn more about herself and her disabilities. She
began to see herself as bright and capable and gained self-confidence. With
this new confidence, she became more involved with her friends. Marie learned
when it was safe to disclose her problems and when it might be best not to do
so. Her family benefitted from their new knowledge of Marie and changed their
image of her as well as their behaviors toward her. Her parents became Marie's
allies in dealing with her disabilities.

<p>In her junior year of high school, Marie returned to me for help. She had
covered up her low reading level with her friends; however, doing this was
getting harder. They would go to a restaurant and she could not read the menu.
They would pass notes to each other and she could not write or spell well.
Covering up was a major challenge. We discussed her need to trust one friend
with information about her disabilities. Marie was afraid that this friend
would then think of her as dumb and reject her. Finally, she did tell this one
friend who then became her helper. At a restaurant, this friend would turn to
Marie and say, "I don't know if I want ..." then read the menu to her. Later,
with more confidence, she shared her problems with all of her friends. They
did not reject her, but, instead, became closer and helped her whenever she
had difficulty. These experiences were valuable for Marie and served her well
later in life.

<p>Through counseling, role playing, and insistence that she act on her own
behalf, she learned to be her own advocate. By the time she entered her senior
year of high school she knew how to select the teachers who taught in a style
most helpful to her. She, not her mother or the special education
professional, met with each teacher to review her areas of strength and
weakness and the needed accommodations in curriculum and in the classroom. If
a teacher was not understanding or cooperative, she discussed the problem with
someone at the school and went back to deal with the teacher directly.

<p>When it was time to select a college, she interacted actively with the
counselor helping the family select colleges. During college interviews, she
spoke of her special needs and asked if the college could provide for these
needs. When it was time to leave for college, she felt confident that she had
the environment and professionals in place to maximize her chances for
success. And she was successful. Midway through college, Marie called me. She 
had to declare a major and "pick" a career. All of her old fears of inadequacy
and of "being dumb" surfaced. Could she ever be "an adult" or be successful in
a job? Could she support herself? We met over that summer and worked on her
self-esteem. She met with a consultant who helped her sort out her strengths
and interest vs. her weaknesses in order to decide on a major as well as a
possible future career. Interestingly, she chose education with the thought of
someday going into special education.

<p>Marie successfully completed college and started working as a first grade
teacher. She joked that she did not want to teach anyone who needed to know
skills at a higher level than hers. I did not hear from her for several years.

<p>Then, at age 24, she called again. "Help. I have this serious boyfriend and I
have serious problems." We met. She discussed her difficulty covering up her
learning disabilities. "He hands me the movie list or TV Guide and asks me to
decide." Or, he would give her a letter with directions while driving and ask
her to read where they should turn. Occasionally, he would hand her a
newspaper article and ask her thoughts. Again, the deep fear that if she told
him she was "disabled" he would no longer like her. We discussed her fears and
how she might approach explaining herself to him. It worked. I was invited to
the engagement party. It was good to see the teamwork starting. He read the
cards while she opened the gifts.

<p>End of story? The story never ends when one has a life time disability. She
called several years later in panic. She was now married and just learned she
was pregnant. "What do I do if my child has a learning disability?" I laughed
but she was frightened. We had to discuss the possibility that she might be
right. However, for her child, the problems would be picked up very early and
the necessary help provided. This child would not have to suffer until tenth
grade before being identified. She relaxed.  

<p>Soon after the baby was born, Marie called asking if I would be willing to do
couples therapy. What became clear was that Marie's ways of compensating for
her disabilities were not known to her husband. He would do something that
"threw her off" and then she would blow up at him. Over a series of sessions,
she was able to understand and explain that in order to work and to take care
of a child and a family, she had to be super organized. Otherwise, her natural
disorganization would result in a disaster. She knew what time she had to be
home. what time the baby needed to be fed, what time to start dinner, and what
time to serve dinner so that she would have enough time after dinner to take
care of the baby and put her to bed. Then, she would have time for lesson
plans, etc. Her life was super organized and almost rigid. If her husband came
home 15 minutes late, maybe because he could not leave work on time, she felt
her whole routine was thrown off and she would explode. He did not know what
hit him and often she did not know why she exploded. As she began to
understand why she needed to be the way she was and he began to understand her
disabilities and how they impacted on her life, they both worked at changes.
They rethought evening and morning responsibilities. With his support and
added effort, she was able to relax more. With his sensitivity to her need for
routine and organization, he made a point of being home on time or of calling.
She learned to not blow up. All benefitted. 

<p>At this time Marie is successful with her career, marriage, and family. Each
phase of her development has presented new challenges. With her knowledge of
herself and her inner drive to solve problems, she has overcome each
challenge. I mention the times she called me. She solved most of her life
crises by herself. Yet, I anticipate hearing from Marie again in the future.

<p>Then there is Bob. He was identified as having a learning disability in first
grade. Bob received special education, speech and language therapy, and
occupational therapy through sixth grade. His parents were pleased that he was
learning. <b>No one ever explained his learning disabilities to them or taught
them what role they needed to play to help him</b>. Because of his
visual-motor disabilities, he did poorly in the sports his friends played and
gradually lost what friends he had. He spent more and more time at home.

<p>When he entered middle school, the school system decided that he no longer
needed intensive help. He was placed in lower-functioning regular classes with
teachers who were to accommodate to his needs. Bob went to a "resource room"
each day for one period with 15 other students. Bob got through middle school
with passing grades. However, he did not learn as much as other students
because of the level of expectation in the lower-level basic classes as well
as the school's approach which focused only on accommodating for his
disabilities. No efforts were made to continuing to work on improving the
areas of disability while helping him to develop compensatory skills. During
middle school he related poorly to classmates and had, at best, casual
friends. He stayed at home and participated in no activities.

<p>High school was a disaster. The school had few services for high school
students with learning disabilities. He was in lower-functioning basic classes
with students who were not interested in school and he was provided no special
education services. By the middle of 11th grade he gave up and quit school.
Initially, Bob got a job at a fast food restaurant and appeared to be happy.
He spoke of going to night school to finish high school. By now, he was
isolated with no peer contacts.

<p>Over the next two years, Bob moved from job to job because he was either fired
for not being on time or he quit. He found a group of adolescents who were in
a similar situation and began to hang around with them. His parents were angry
and frustrated with Bob and feared that he would "never grow up." Yet, they
did not know what to do.

<p>They contacted me when Bob was 24. He was sleeping all day and going out with
his friends at night. They were concerned that he might be an alcoholic. He
had not held a job for over a year. They felt helpless and had allowed him to
live at home while they supported him. When I obtained a history and
questioned about his learning disabilities, they wondered why I did so. "Those
were only problems when he was a child. He learned to read."

<p>My evaluation of Bob showed him to have academic skills at about the eighth
grade level with significant evidence of learning disabilities. He was
depressed with a very poor self-image and very low self-esteem. Bob had no
positive concept of himself, did not feel that he belonged anywhere, and had
no sense of a future. He was alcohol dependent. Bob spoke of his helplessness
and hopelessness and described himself as someone so dumb he could not even
finish high school.
<p>
<b>If only</b> his school had realized that learning disabilities are life
time disabilities and that they could not stop services after grade school.
<b>If only</b> his parents had been provided the knowledge about learning
disabilities so that they would have been able to advocate for better help
during middle school and high school. <b>If only</b> Bob had received
psychological help before he became a casualty. <b>If only... We see too many
"if onlys" with our adolescents and young adults. We acknowledge that they
have learning disabilities and then fail to do what is necessary to help them.
We do not educate the parents. School professionals and families fail and the
individual fails</b>. The future for Bob is not good. He now has his learning
disabilities along with significant emotional, social, and family problems and
a substance abuse problem.

<p>We see too few Maries and too many Bobs. How do we change this? What is needed
to develop the level of self knowledge that results in a positive self esteem
and the ability to learn to be a self advocate? We know the answers. We have
not yet learned to practice what we know. The answers are clear:

<ul>
<li>School systems must identify students with learning disabilities early and
provide the necessary help throughout their education.

<li>Individuals must be educated about their disabilities and special needs
early and throughout their education. They must first have advocates, then be
shown how to be an advocate, and then allowed to practice being their own
advocate.

<li>Parents must learn about their son's or daughter's learning disabilities and
learning abilities and how they can build on strengths while addressing the
weaknesses in all family and social situations.

<li>Parents must have the knowledge of their son's or daughter's needs and be
taught how to be informed and assertive advocates. They need to understand the
needs for each phase of their son's or daughter's life.
</ul>

<p>The individual with a learning disability must finish high school with the
academic knowledge and skills needed to move into the post secondary world.
This individual must have a positive sense of self, resulting in a high level
of self-esteem. He or she must be knowledgeable about his or her disabilities,
abilities, and special needs and be able to advocate for these special needs.
With these successes, each has a chance to make it in the post secondary world
and in adult life. Without these successes, their disability may become a
handicap and their chances for success become greatly restricted.

<h3>BUILDING THROUGH KNOWLEDGE</h3>

<p>Until the diagnosis of a learning disability is made, the child or adolescent
is as confused as are parents or teachers. This student has only had one brain
and does not know that it is "wired" differently. She or he tries as hard as
everyone else to learn and to succeed but does not. He or she does not want to
be bad yet everyone seems to be angry. The child often feels no control over
life. How they are perceived and how they perceive themselves appears to be
based on people or events outside of themselves. They often feel frustrated
with their school and peer difficulties yet do not know what to do. They feel 
helpless.

<p>Until the diagnosis is made, teachers become frustrated.The teacher is trying
and the child is not learning. Further, this student may be misbehaving and
disrupting the class. The teacher might let the student know of his or her
frustration. In addition, this teacher might let the parents know. Parents get
calls. "You have to make your child do his homework." "Please tell your
daughter to get her work done in class and to write neater." "You must punish
your son for clowning in class." Parents, already frustrated, now react to the
teacher's frustration. The teacher also feels helpless.

<p>Because learning disabilities are life disabilities, the child who is not
doing well in school may also not be doing well within the family or with
peers. Parents, worried and frustrated, begin to feel inadequate. They feel
helpless.

<p>Once the diagnosis is made, all must change. It is critical that the family be
educated about learning disabilities and specifically about their son's or
daughter's learning disabilities. The educational diagnostician, special
education tutor or another professional must accept the responsibility for
providing this information to parents. Classroom teachers must learn of this
student's learning disabilities and what accommodations will be needed in each
classroom. The coordinator of special education services for this student must
accept the responsibility for educating the classroom teachers.

<p>Of equal importance, the child or adolescent must learn of his or her learning
disabilities. Without such knowledge, nothing makes sense. With this
knowledge, they can begin to understand and to regain control over their
lives. They can stop blaming themselves. As they learn about themselves and
their needs, they can become active rather than passive. They can take control
and begin to feel empowered to have a positive impact on their life.

<p><b>BUILDING THE PARENT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHILD:</b><br>
Because learning disabilities are life disabilities, interfering with
functioning in school, in the family, and with peers, it is critical that the
parents understand their child's areas of disabilities and abilities to the
same extent as the professionals who are to work with this child. They must
know the areas of learning abilities so that they can build on them. They must
know the areas of learning disabilities so that they can advocate for
necessary school services and can accommodate to these disabilities during
non-school activities. They can learn to help their son or daughter compensate
for the disabilities when necessary.

<p>With this knowledge, parents can select family activities, chores, sports and
other activities, and peer interactions that maximize the strengths while
minimizing or adjusting to the weaknesses. With this knowledge they can be
informed and assertive advocates with the school system as well as with
activities outside of school. With this knowledge, they can begin to help
their daughter or son accept and understand the problems. They can demonstrate
how to be an advocate and then teach this child or adolescent to become his or
her own advocate. 

<p>The learning disabilities will be apparent at home. Parents must let this
child or adolescent and the other family members know that they understand.
They understand and they accept. They can reassure this child that the
necessary help is there. They can point out when the disabilities interfere
with family or peer activities and begin to talk about resolutions.

<p>What about household chores? Parents do not want to excuse this child from
such activities. First, they will be giving a clear nonverbal message that
they agree he or she is inadequate. Second, they will create sibling anger at
the double standards. With knowledge, parents can begin to select chores that
build on strengths rather than magnify weaknesses. The child with visual
perception and fine motor disabilities might do poorly loading or unloading
the dishwasher. But, he or she might do well with tasks that require minimal
eye-hand coordination and that build on gross motor skills. He or she could
walk the dog or take out the trash or bring in the newspaper. Suppose this
child has a sequencing problem (i.e., getting the steps of a task in the right
order). He or she might need more help with homework or with getting dressed.
Knowing this, parent can adapt the ways they help. Knowing this, they can
teach this individual to compensate. Suppose a mother says to her child,
"Look, I know it is hard for you to set the table because you are confused
about where to put the fork, knife, spoon, and glass. So, I just drew a
picture of a typical place setting. I will put it in this drawer in the
kitchen. Whenever it is your turn to set the table, feel free to take it out
and use it." What is this parent saying? "You have a disability. I cannot make
it go away; but, I can teach you how to compensate." This child or adolescent
will not be excused from life but will be helped to learn how to succeed in
life.

<p>Success in peer activities is critical to a positive self image and to
building the social skills needed as an adult. With knowledge of their son's
or daughter"s learning disabilities and learning abilities, parents can
maximize the possibility of successes with these activities. How do they
select sports, clubs, and other programs that are most likely to be
successful? They need to select events that build on strengths and then work
with the activity leader and others to maximize accommodations.

<p>Each sport requires different strengths. The child or adolescent with visual
perception and visual motor disabilities might have difficulty with sports
that require quick eye-hand coordination, doing such tasks as hitting,
throwing, or catching a ball. Baseball or basketball might be poorly played
and avoided. A parent can look for sports that require more gross motor
abilities with minimal eye-hand skills such as swimming, soccer, bowling,
horseback riding, sailing, canoeing, and certain field and track events. The
child who refuses to play baseball might excel at swimming. Let swimming be
his or her area of success. Some may find all sports difficult. It might be
possible to improve some of the required skills through practice. If he or she
has difficulty following directions or doing activities in the proper
sequence, parents might practice or provide additional time to learn such
tasks.

<p>What about activities? With knowledge, parents can maximize successes in the
same way as with sports. Suppose a son or daughter in a scout group has visual
perception and visual motor problems but strengths in receptive and expressive
language. He or she goes to a meeting and everyone is working on a project,
e.g., cutting out pumpkins or drawing turkeys. This child does not draw,
color, or cut well and everyone laughs. End of scouts and another failure.
But, if the parents spoke to the scout leader about building on strengths and
minimizing weaknesses, the ending could be very different. He or she might
have been given the job of handing out the paper, squirting the glue, smearing
the paste while others did the drawing and coloring. Or, this child might have
been given the assignment in advance of learning why the turkey is the symbol
of Thanksgiving. While the others did the arts and crafts activities, this
child told the group the history of Thanksgiving. Building on strengths rather
than exposing weaknesses can lead to successes rather than failures. Parent
knowledge and appropriate interventions are essential to accomplish this.

<p>The same strategy is used in selecting day camps or sleep-away camps. If the
child described above was a boy and went to a camp with a major focus on
competitive sports, the outcome might be disastrous. This child would not play
well. His team would not do well and, everyone would get angry with him. But,
suppose the parents thought ahead, using their knowledge of strengths. What
camps would build on his strengths? Perhaps he would do well at a
water-activities camp. Swimming, sailing, canoeing, rowing are all gross motor
sports with minimal need for eye-hand coordination. There, the parents could
think of other problems. Perhaps the camp director needs to tell everyone that
this child might not understand directions the first time told. Or, that he
has a reading and writing problem. Thus, parents will mail tapes for him to
listen to. He will then erase the tape and dictate a letter to be mailed.
Counselors will appreciate such knowledge and, with such knowledge, can make
the camp experience a happy and successful one.

<p><b>BUILDING THE CHILD'S KNOWLEDGE OF SELF:</b><br>
<b>Once the diagnosis of a learning disability is established, it is critical
that the child learns as much as possible about the disabilities</b>. Someone,
probably the diagnostician or special education professional working with him
or her must share this information. The only difference between explaining to
a five year old or to a 15 year old is the style of communicating. For the
younger child, the information might be very general. "You learn better when
you hear things than when you see things." As he or she gets older, more
details can be added. When explaining the learning disabilities, it is
essential that the learning abilities be stressed as well. It us also
important to stress who will be helping the child or adolescent overcome these
problems. 

<p>The special education tutor or other professional working with the child or
adolescent with a learning disability is critical to this educational process.
The traditional model for tutoring or for providing speech and language
therapy, occupational therapy, or other intervention is a passive model. "Sit
down and start to work on the pages I marked in this workbook." or "Today I am
going to say a group of words and ask you to tell me what they mean." The
child or adolescent has no idea why he or she is doing the exercise and has no
opportunity to learn about himself or herself. What a difference if the tutor
were to say, "You know that you have a visual figure-ground problem and that
because of this you might skip words or lines when you read. I want you to
work with me on this exercise that will help you become more aware of this
problem so that you can learn to correct yourself." Or, "I have been working
on helping you improve your auditory perception skills. Today I am going to
say a group of words that sound similar so that we can practice helping you to
minimize this problem area." The passive model makes the student dependent and
often ignorant of the reason for the work. The active model helps the student
learn more about his or her disabilities and abilities.

<p>By middle school or high school, the tutor or other professional working with
the student must shift to the role of consultant and helper. thus forcing the
student to clarify his or her needs. The usual model is for the tutor to say,
"Today I want to show you a way of sequencing and organizing materials before
you begin to outline and then write a paper." Suppose the tutor went over
previous work, gradually helping the student see how his or her problem with
sequencing and organization interfered with writing papers. Then, the tutor
said, "It looks as if you will need to learn how to compensate for your
sequencing and organization problems if you are to put all of your excellent
thoughts down in a paper. I need to help you learn how to compensate. Let me
suggest an approach." By high school, the student needs to be in control and
to see the tutor or other professional as an assistant, helping him or her
succeed. The student should come in and say, "This teacher lectures a lot. If
I just listen to her I understand. But, then I go home with no notes and have
to trust my memory. If I try to take notes, my written language problem messes
me up and I end up with poor and incomplete notes. Worse. I am so busy trying
to take notes, I cannot pay attention and listen. What do I do?"

<p>With knowledge comes understanding and a sense of control. Parents, teachers,
and members of the special education team must increasingly push the
individual to problem solve. It would be easier if the special education
professional spoke to the classroom teacher. But, by high school the student
must understand what needs to be done. If students do not learn to be their
own advocate in high school, they will not be able to be their own advocate
after high school.

<p>How do parents and professionals teach an adolescent to take on the
responsibilities of being their own advocate? This must be done in a
step-by-step process. First, the parent or professional must become
knowledgeable and become the assertive advocate. Next, this adult must model
through their actions and later through role playing how to be a successful
advocate. After modeling, it is essential that the responsibility be
relinquished to the adolescent. The parent or professional must trust that the
adolescent can do the task. Unless the adolescent feels that he or she did
what was needed, he or she cannot take ownership for the outcome or accept the
success as belonging to him or her. Finally, the parent or professional must
be there to cheer and praise the adolescent for his or her success.

<p>First comes knowledge of self. This knowledge improves self-esteem. Then the
student sees parents and professionals advocating. Next comes demonstrations
on how to advocate as they watch how the adults do it. Finally, the student
must learn to be his or her own advocate.

<p><b>Building the Child's Self-esteem</b><br>
Self-esteem is usually defined along two themes. It is based in part on
outside feedback and in part on internal feedback. That is, it is based on
perceived appraisals of significant others and based on the individual's
feelings of performance and competence. The outside feedback represents
inferred social approval while the internal feedback represents self approval.

<p>If a child or adolescent is unsuccessful in school, his or her self-concept,
self-image, self-confidence, and self-respect can only be low. He or she
cannot be talked out of this assessment because these impressions are a
collection of real experiences. When this child or adolescent senses
dissatisfaction with his or her efforts and hears the suggestion that he or
she is not working up to potential, self-doubt moves in. When the best efforts
are met with criticism, failure, and frustration, self-doubt increases as does
a sense of inadequacy. 

<p>The poor self-esteem of the child with a disability will be compounded if he
or she is also unsuccessful with peers and/or within the family. It appears
that he or she is inadequate every place. Gradually, a cycle may begin. Low
self esteem impacts on academic work and on the individual's personality,
resulting in even less successful experiences in school and out of school.
These failures lead to a greater loss of self esteem.

<p>As discussed throughout this chapter, it is critical for the individual with a
learning disability to be identified early and for all of the essential
services to be made available throughout his or her education. It is equally
critical that the family understand the learning disabilities and the
essential role parents must play in helping to maximize success with peers and
in home-based and other activities. With the help of the school system and the
family and with an opportunity to learn about self, the individual with a
learning disability will feel good about himself or herself and build a good
sense of self-esteem. Only with this knowledge and self-esteem can any child
or adolescent move toward self advocacy

<p>I can do no better job of illustrating the concept of self-esteem and the
impact of a learning disability than to let Jill explain for herself. She
wrote this essay (copied exactly as she wrote it) as a college English
assignment and sent it to me shortly after starting college. We had worked
together since she entered middle school and she understood her learning
disabilities and special needs. It was this knowledge of herself that helped
her describe her life.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>I think that when I was born I was put in a rocket ship and taken to another
planet - earth. I never felt that I was like anyone else here. From the time I
was five, I can recall feeling like an outsider. I first remember feeling like
an alien when I tried to communicate. People would raise their eyebrows and
make other facial expressions of confusion when I tried to express myself. I
was aware of starting a sentence in my head but only the last half came out of
my mouth. I know how E.T. must have felt. It was like I was speaking another
language and thinking on another wave length. Constant rejection created
feelings of isolation and isolation created anger and anger creates self
defeat. I could not judge time and was anxious about being late. I never got a
joke (no matter how simple) because it was abstract, and I could never get
myself or my work in order because of my sequencing problems. Printing was
murder because of my perceptual problems and my spacing was the worst. I could
never remember anything but the first part of a direction and the noise level
of the then popular "open classroom" drove me crazy. I always wondered why
everyone got everything the teacher did but me. Definitely wrong planet!

<p>I found one accepting person to be friends with and stuck to her like glue.
Most of my anger at my environment and my inability to control it or even make
sense out of it was directed at my parents and brother because I knew they
couldn't leave me like the others, no matter what I did. Once I kicked a hole
in the wall because I couldn't find my shoes and that proved how dumb I really
was. Only a moron could lose their shoes - I wanted to kick myself but was at
least smart enough to choose the wall instead. It was so hard getting through
everyday life; things that other people automatically did required constant
thought and concern for me. To protect myself, I built a wall around myself.

<p>I could only handle myself and my needs. No one else mattered, not my family
or friends. My family was angry at my self-centered ways. I was the black
sheep - the alien - the different one. I never understood why everyone was so
angry with me. Why didn't they understand that I was just surviving? My
daydreams were of me in a rough and choppy ocean where a storm was raging. I
was all alone in the middle of a great black sea. It took all of my strength
just to stay above the water. I had no energy left to call for help or even
notice if anyone else was around. That's how my life was. I had to be
self-centered to survive.

<p>School was no haven. The teachers said I was unmotivated and not paying
attention. Some even yelled at me and physically shook me. One teacher
who really thought she understood learning disabilities would say "does
everyone understand?" And then she turned to me, as the class followed her
gaze, and said, "and do you, Jill?" I suddenly felt my antenne's
sprouting from my head. Everyone knew I was different when I was taken from
the room for tutoring and later I had to lie about special teachers and the
"resource room" (a place for the "slower kids") In school, it's every
teenagers nightmare to be different.

<p>By high school my conversations had improved to the point where I was accepted
as an "airhead" but I still had to keep my special "help room" a secret. With
careful planning I could sneak into the resource room just as the bell rang
and everyone was out of the halls. Talk about being different - when someone
asked who my English teacher was, no one knew her because only "SPEDS"
(Special Education students) had her and normal kids didn't know she existed.
High school was a turning point. I started noticing things. Dr. Silver, a
psychiatrist who really understands how to explain learning disabilities, made
me aware of ways to compensate for my shortcomings. I began to read people
from their faces and body language. If their faces looked confused, I would
say, "Did I say something wrong?" Or, I would make a joke. Sometimes I would
just start over. Dr. Silver showed me how to use little tricks to get around
my disabilities like leaning forward to concentrate on a professor's lecture
and this trick also helped force out disturbing background noises. Dr. Silver
explained that with my auditory discrimination problems, bars with large
crowds would become very difficult social meeting places for me. I feel like
I'm there, people are there. Music is there but I'm in a plastic bubble
separated from everyone. All the noises, the conversation, the band, the
glasses clinking - all are amplified and blended together like a senseless
drone. I can't hear anyone's conversation because I only hear parts of what
they say and none of it makes sense. I try to fill in the missing parts but my
answers must be off the wall from the reactions I got. I keep thinking in the
middle of everyone having fun. "Scotty, beam me up. Get me out of here!!"

<p>At college, there is a wonderful learning disabilities program. The term L.D.
has come to mean learning desirable to me. I have found my planet! People like
me do exist and they aren't crazy. We even joke about being L.D. Its like a
private club and its not impopular. At dinner, if someone forgets their
silverware there is a chorus of L.D., L.D., L.D. and a knowing smile of
acceptance. (Once, four of us got lost driving to a dance and my friend, the
driver, said, "Oh, no! Four L.D.s and not one has a pencil." She quickly
assigned one part of the directions to each of us. "You remember the first
part, you the second, and you the third." We all laughed at ourselves. At this
college I cannot use L.D. as an excuse. I found that in real life no one cares
if I'm L.D. They only care if I don't try. Its results that count, not
excuses. I really wanted to be a radio d.j., but I knew that with my
disabilities it would be impossible. How could I "cue"" records, answer phone
requests, and check scripts all at the same time. But, guess what? The girl
voted "Biggest Airhead - Class of 1984" just got her F.M. license. Everyone
from professors to students had quizzed me whenever they saw me. No one let me
quit.

<p>Life is still not a breeze. My friends, who say they understand, still get mad
when I say I can't listen to the radio, talk, and hear directions at the same
time. They still can't believe it when I go left when they say right.
Actually, I have more trouble understanding why I do the exact opposite, but I
know I'm not dumb or an airhead. That's how my brain works or doesn't work.
That's me. I'm not different. I'm special! No one is more sensitive to others
than I am. I am my own friend and I have recently begun to feel better about
myself and to like myself. I am having success. I will be an L.D. forever. It
will never go away, but each day I learn to handle another thing or work
something out and things get better for me. How many people can say that??

<p><b>BUILDING THE ADOLESCENT'S ABILITY TO DO SELF ADVOCACY</b><br>
For a person with a learning disability to be successful in any post secondary
experiences, he or she must understand his or her needs and know how to be an
informed and assertive advocate. Parents can no longer play this role. As
discussed earlier, parents are the advocates for the child. By middle school
parents and teachers must teach the young adolescent the role of being an
advocate. By high school, the older adolescent must become his or her own
advocate.

<p>Let me illustrate. John was in twelfth grade. He requested to meet with his
English teacher, Mr. Bratten, during the time in August when teachers reported
to work but school had not yet started for the students. John introduced
himself and explained that he had personally selected him as his English
teacher. He then went on to say that he had a reading disability and could not
read very fast. But, the teacher did not have to worry. John had visited the
teacher in June and gotten the list of books to read during the course. He had
read the first four over the summer to get a head start. He knew he would have
a lot of difficulty with one book and had ordered it on audiotape. Thus, he
did not ask for accommodations for reading time. However, he explained that he
did not read well out loud, often mispronouncing words. He asked if the
teacher would mind not calling on him in class to read. He went on to explain
that he had a written language problem and could not write as fast as he
wanted to. He also made spelling and grammar errors. He asked for more time on
tests so that he could finish and that the teacher not grade him down for
spelling. He commented that he would do all home assignments on his computer
and did not need special consideration then. Mr. Bratten thanked him for
coming in and agreed to help in every way possible.

<p>Let's go over John's conversation to see how well he knew himself and his
special needs and how he had learned to be his own advocate. He did not say
that he personally picked this teacher to impress the teacher. He knew how he
learned and what style of teacher was best for him. During the end of his
junior year, he asked all of his friends in the senior class to describe their
English teacher. He picked the one who taught in the way that he learned best.
His special education teacher made sure he got that teacher.

<p>We often tell children and adolescents with learning disabilities that they
"just learn differently" and that with special help they can do well by
working just as hard as everyone else. John knew this was not true. If you
have a disability and want to succeed, you have to work harder than the
average student and you have to plan ahead. He was willing to use part of his
summer preparing for the course because he wanted to succeed.

<p>John knew something else, If his mother had met with the teacher and read off
the list of accommodations, the teacher would have probably said, "Look, I
have 30 kids per class and five classes a day. If your son cannot make it in a
regular class, he should not be in my class." He knew that the teacher would
be more willing to listen to him, especially if he sounded responsible and
more than willing to do his share of the work. Think of the knowledge John had
of himself.

<p>Think of the self-confidence and self-esteem needed to meet with his teacher
in this way. Think of how successful he was as an advocate. Since he did it
all himself, he could claim ownership and could claim the success. None of
this could have happened if the education and modeling work had not started
when he was a child.

<p>To be a successful advocate for oneself, then, requires first of all a full
knowledge of one's learning disabilities, learning abilities, and special
needs. With this knowledge, the person can look ar new subjects, new teachers,
new experiences and project what will go well and what will require special
time, help, or accommodations. He or she can then plan ahead and advocate for
these needs. With this knowledge and advocacy role, the adolescent and young
adult feels in control of life and not helpless. There is confidence gained
when a student knows what he or she needs and how to fight for these needs.

<p>Advocacy takes place with friends as well. If she or he has a receptive or
expressive language problem, communicating with friends might be a major
problem. If he or she has visual perception or visual motor problems, certain
activities or sports might be difficult. He or she needs to assess situations
and decide how to compensate and cope. Perhaps it means selecting certain
activities over others. Perhaps it means meeting with key people in advance
and learning what to expect. Perhaps it means disclosing to a friend so that
friend will understand and hopefully help. As with the earlier example of
Marie, the adolescent might need to learn how to be a self-advocate by
discussing the issues with an adult and, possibly, by modeling the necessary
actions with this adult before trying with the real person.

<h3>IN SUMMARY</h3>

<p>Whether as a parent or a professional, helping the child or adolescent with a
learning disability requires a full understanding of the total person in his
or her total world for each stage of psycho-social development. It is clear
that more is needed than appropriate special education interventions. School
time represents about half of the total world for the child or adolescent. The
role of the family in helping i$ critical as is the help that can be provided
by the leaders of outside of school activities.

<p>The special education team must understand the child's or adolescent's
learning disabilities and abilities in order to develop the best
individualized education plan and interventions. This knowledge is critical
for the regular classroom teachers if they are to be able to accommodate and
adapt the curriculum, teaching style, and classroom.

<p>This knowledge is essential for the parents. They must know their son's or
daughter's areas of learning disability and learning ability if they are to
accommodate and adapt the family to provide the supportive and nurturing home
needed by the child or adolescent with a learning disability. Only with this
knowledge can they intelligently select chores, home activities, sports, and
other peer activities that build on strengths while minimizing, accommodating,
or compensating for the weaknesses.

<p>This knowledge is equally essential to the child or adolescent who has
learning disabilities. She or he must understand fully their learning
disabilities and learning abilities if they are to understand themselves and
if they are to learn to accept and develop a positive image of self. Only with
this knowledge can they understand their special needs and learn to self
advocate to get these needs met.

<p>With this knowledge, school programs can be designed to help the student with
a learning disability fit in and succeed. With this knowledge, parents can
provide the proper family and can maximize social and peer successes. With
this knowledge, the individual can accept, understand, and like himself or
herself. This knowledge of the needs of a child or adolescent with a learning
disability, when applied to the total world he or she lives in, results in the
development of a positive self-image and a strong feeling of self-esteem. With
such feelings, this student will be available to learn to be a self advocate.
The successes that result from being an informed and assertive advocate will
feed back to increase the feelings of self.

<p><b>First comes knowledge. Knowledge is the key to self-esteem and the ability
to self advocate.</b>
