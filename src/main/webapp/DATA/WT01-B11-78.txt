        <h3>Mission Statement </h3>
        <p>St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf is committed to the
        auditory/oral education, spiritual and emotional growth,
        and personal development of hearing impaired children and
        young adults. We -- as faculty, board management and
        support personnel -- work together to give the gift of
        spoken language to those who would otherwise not know it. </p>
        <p>The Institute's teaching resources are first applied
        in the earliest stages of language development, always in
        a teaching partnership with parents. Preschool and
        primary programs combine general education with an
        intensive program for language development. A residential
        option attracts students from communities across the
        nation where no age-appropriate auditory/oral programs
        exist. </p>
        <p>Since we seek to have our students effectively
        mainstreamed into society, our formal curriculum
        concludes at the end of the eighth grade. Continuing
        educational guidance and family and child support
        programs extend through the high school and college
        years. </p>
        <p>St. Joseph Institute's 158 year history and
        international reputation impose obligations of continued
        leadership: an involvement in educational research, the
        prudent incorporation of biomedical and technical
        advances and the professional development of educators of
        the deaf. </p>
        <p>The Institute's environment combines familial warmth
        with assured professionalism. While our work is
        ecumenical, we bring to it a distinctive Catholic spirit,
        reflecting the values and traditions of the Sisters of
        St. Joseph of Carondelet. These values are evident in our
        commitment &quot;to serve those who would otherwise be
        unserved.&quot; To this mission we dedicate our energies
        and those resources which our benefactors generously
        provide. </p>
