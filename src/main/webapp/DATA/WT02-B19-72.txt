<i><u>Professor C.R. Ethier</u></i><p>
     Current research interests are related to fluid flow and mass transport in biological
systems.  We carry out research in three specific areas.  Firstly, experimental
investigation and numerical modelling of blood flow in arteries and arterial grafts are being conducted so as
to identify fluid mechanical influences on graft failure.  Secondly, the production and outflow
of aqueous humor within the eye is being modelled and experimentally studied in an ongoing
study of glaucoma.  Thirdly, fluid flow and solute transport through connective tissue is being
investigated. <p>

<i><u>Professor A.A. Goldenberg</u></i><p>
     Development of robotic aids for the handicapped.  Robotics for surgery and
micro-surgery. <p>

<i><u>Professor D.F. James</u></i><p>
     Research consists of fundamental studies in various fields of biomechanics. Recent work
has included temperature rise in bone drilling, dental implant stress analysis, perfusion through tissue, while
current research is focusing on physiological lubrication.  To understand how joints are
lubricated, we are analyzing squeeze-film lubrication, taking into account the properties of
cartilage and the rheology of synovial fluid. <p>

<i><u>Professor D.McCammond</u></i><p>
     Analysis of stresses associated with dental implants and prosthesis. <p>

<i><u>Professor S.A. Meguid</u></i><p>
     External skeletal fixation devices used in the treatment of open or unstable longbone
fractures rely on the use of pins.  These pins transfer the loads between bone fragments and the
relatively rigid structure of the fixator for controlled immobilization at the fracture site.  External
loads applied to the fractured limb by adjustment of the fixator frame or by muscle contraction
generally cause pin bending which may result in pin loosening, pin track infection or bone
fracture.  The main objective of these studies is to evaluate the pin-bone interface stresses using
both experimental and theoretical techniques. <p>
     In addition, efforts are devoted to identify a link between the quasi-static and dynamic
responses of a tennis racquet and the pain experienced by many tennis players; namely, lateral
epicondylitis.<p>

<i><u>Professor M. Milner</u></i><p>
     There are opportunities for involvement in a research and development programme in
Rehabilitation Engineering which relates to the development of devices, systems and techniques
to aid disabled persons. Some specific concerns of the programme include postural support,
mobility systems, microcomputer applications, prosthetics and orthotics, applications of robotics,
and human locomotor engineering aspects including gait study and functional electrical
stimulation of skeletal muscles.<p>

<i><u>Professor A.W. Neumann</u></i><p>
     Application of thermodynamics to processes of biomedical relevance: Modelling of cell
and protein adhesion to synthetic and natural biomaterials with the view of improving vascular
implants.  Studies of phagocytic ingestion of bacteria by white cells from the point of view of
surface and interfacial tensions.  Application of surface thermodynamics to biotechnological
problems. <p>

<i><u>Professor C.A. Ward</u></i><p>
     When a person is subjected to a substantial pressure change, one of the consequences can
be bubble formation in the circulatory system. This occurs, for example, when an individual does
deep-sea diving or when flying high performance aircraft.  Complement activation is one
consequence of the interaction between the bubble surface and blood plasma, and it may mediate
decompression sickness.  We are developing a method to determine the susceptibility of an
individual to decompression sickness by determining the amount of complement activation that
occurs when bubbles are incubated with a sample of the individual's plasma. <p>
     The compatibility between a synthetic material and blood is determined in large measure
by the degree of complement activation that follows the exposure of blood to the material.  We
are developing methods for preparing a material so as to minimize the degree of complement
activation.  The objective of the research is to provide a sufficiently compatible material so that
it can be used for replacement of small diameter arteries. <p>
