	The Internet promises to open up a wide new market for information

vendors.  It is estimated that online services and the Internet will comprise a

nearly 14 billion dollar industry within a year or two.  The growth of  public

consumption of online services and the Internet has been geometric.

Entreprenuers and established content providers, software companies and bold

new start-ups are clamboring for domain names and Internet connections.  The

once-wide-open frontier is being settled and these pioneers are looking to

build their fortunes on the information industry that is replacing our

industrial past.  <p>

	But this frontier has been lawless for some time.  Some groups have revelled

in the Internet's lawlessness in the understandable belief that governmental

interference should be avoided at all costs.  "That government is best which

governs least, or not at all."  However, frontiers are not as hospitable to

industry as they are to civil liberties.  The result in cyberspace is vast

areas of uncharted legal wilderness of which those who seek their fortunes on

the net are probably ill informed.  <p>

	The law of intellectual property is, as it stands, ill-equiped to protect

content and information providers seeking to peddle their wares on the net.

There is a dangerous ambiguity in the statutory and common law of copyright as

it applies to the net.  This ambiguity threatens the integrity of providers'

property claims to information distributed on networks.   <p>

<p>

BACKGROUND<p>

	Advances in technology have had a phenomenal impact upon copyright law since

its inception. In order to safeguard the exclusive rights to reproduction,

distribution and first-sale of works granted to authors under copyright law,

sweeping changes in statutory implementation and interpretation of copyright

have ocurred as reproduction and distribution of works has become easier.  For

example, the photocopying machine and recordable audio cassettes posed

potential challenges to the security of intellectual property rights, but these

advances were only a minor threat to written works and a somewhat more serious

but still negligible threat to audio works given the inherent limitations of

the technologies.  The relatively low fidelity of photocopies and analog audio

and video tapes present little threat to a copyright owner that her works will

be unlawfully reproduced beyond one generation (typically a user's own archival

or delayed viewing purposes for audio and video).  However, with the advent of

digital reproduction, new measures such as the Audio Home Recording Act of

1992<a href="int_fn.html#fn0">[1]</a> were deemed necessary.<p>

	A new threat to copyright owners' control over their works looms in the same

advance which promises a great new market for such works.  The Internet ("net")

and the proposed National Information Infrastructure ("NII") pose both such a

threat and promise.  The Internet exists now.  It is the name given the

interconnected computer networks which grew around the U.S. Army's Arpanet

developed in the late sixties and seventies.<a href="int_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a><p>

	Over the Internet countless pieces of e-mail and software travel between

computers in nearly every conceivable corner of the earth.  The NII which is

now "under construction" is the name given the foreseen nexus of current

technologies such as cable television and telephones and the Internet.<a

href="int_fn.html#fn1">[3]</a>  The NII is being constructed now by private

entities and will be run by cable, telephone and perhaps entirely new

industries.  The NII or "information superhighway" will carry all sorts of

content ranging from entertainment to raw data.  A broadband network combined

with television set-top boxes or tied into personal computers will allow users

to view movies, download books, browse countless information databanks, conduct

financial transactions, videoconference and enjoy numerous other as yet

unforeseen services.<a href="int_fn.html#fn1">[4]</a>  Clearly, such a future

holds many possible conflicts in the area of copyright law.  Some of the

sources of these conflicts are already becoming apparent through disputes

regarding the Internet.  What follows is a discussion of some of those disputes

which center around the issues of reproduction, distribution, the first sale

doctrine and transmission of copyrighted materials over the net.<p>

<p>

<u>TRADITIONALLY COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS AND THE NET</u><p>

	The net poses a number of challenges to traditional legal notions and terms

concerning copyrighted materials.  Such materials include written works such as

books and magazines, audio recordings, motion pictures, and photographs.  A

producer of any of these works may, under copyright law, reserve for herself

certain exclusive rights.<a href="int_fn.html#fn2">[5]</a>subject to sections

107 through 118, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive

rights to do and authorize any of the following:<p>

<p>

(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work ...<p>

(2) to prepare derivative works ...<p>

(3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work ...  <p>

<p>

	The rights of a holder of a copyright may be infringed by, <u>inter</u>

<u>alia</u>, unauthorized reproduction or distribution of the copyrighted

works.  For books, photos and motion pictures, infringement is not a

complicated matter to assess.  Photocopies of  books are easy to spot and of

lower quality than originals and it is too expensive and risky for a small

printing company to pirate an entire book profitably.  Analog audio tapes also

degrade in quality from generation to generation and illegal copies are less

desirable to consumers than originals.  Moreover the unauthorized reproduction

of books, motion pictures and audio tapes is an act which is easy to locate in

time and space.  That is, a book is reproduced when it is photocopied or

typeset.  An audio tape is reproduced when it is dubbed.  Each of these is

distributed when an unauthorized reproduction is sold.  The moment of sale

implicates the distribution and the moment of copying, the reproduction.  These

concepts of reproduction and distribution are not so easily applied to

transactions over the Internet.<p>

	Take, for instance, "browsing" on the World Wide Web ("Web").  When one uses

the Mosaic or Netscape software to browse on the Web one may view text and

graphics on one's own computer the originals of which reside on another

computer which may be physically located far away but connected to the net.

The originals are <a href="int_fn.html#fn2">[6]</a>reconstructed in the local

computer's memory as it was on the server site.  This information may further

be transferred through phone lines to a user's computer through a modem.  The

information, in such a configuration exists simultaneously and identically at

the server (original site), host (the computer the user has called with his

modem), and the terminal (the user's own computer).  An author could

conceivably have a Web "site" containing an electronically typeset version of

her novel which could be browsed page-by-page on the Web.  Such a site might

look to the browser who is connecting to the site just like a page of actually

typeset text yet be entirely virtual.<a href="int_fn.html#fn2">[7]</a>  When

would such a novel be reproduced or distributed?  This question is even more

complicated if our hypothetical cyber-author decides to make the entire text

downloadable.  The browsing of the Web site involves reproducing the binary

code of the original document on the browser's computer.  It may actually

involve more than one reproduction if the user is tied into a host computer as

well as a terminal.  If such browsing is deemed to be reproduction then the law

must clarify this so that such reproductions may be liscenced as need be.  <p>

<p>

<u>DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS: THE FIRST SALE DOCTRINE</u><p>

	What is more problematic is the question of distribution.  Ordinarily,

distribution in copyright law involves the changing of hands of physical copies

of a work.  The owner of a copyright has an exclusive right in the first

distribution of a work pursuant to the so-called "first sale doctrine".<a

href="int_fn.html#fn2">[8]</a>  Once an authorized copy of a work is

distributed, however, the copyright holder has no control over subsequent

re-distribution of a work.  This doctrine protects the right of purchasers of

copyrighted works to freely alienate such legally obtained copies.  If our

hypothetical Web-novel browser is actually reading a licensed reproduction of a

distributed work may he then freely alienate that reproduction pursuant to the

first-sale doctrine?  This is an issue which remains as-yet unresolved in the

courts, but it is one which will soon need addressing as the NII takes shape.<p>

	In fact a Federal District court in the Eleventh Circuit recently ruled that

an owner of an electronic bulletin board system ("BBS") was liable for unlawful

display and distribution of copyrighted materials when he made digitized

copyrighted photographs which he unlawfully reproduced available for

downloading from his computer over the phone lines.<a

href="int_fn.html#fn2">[9]</a>  This decision made no mention of unauthorized

reproduction.  Rather, the only mention made of copying in <u>Frena</u> is

defendant's digitization of the photographs which was easily inferred through

circumstantial evidence.<a href="int_fn.html#fn3">[10]</a>  The <u>Frena</u>

court proceeded to inquire into defendant's violation of plaintiff's exclusive

public distribution and display rights.  The court glossed over the

distribution issue finding only that "[t]here is no dispute that Defendant

Frena supplied a product containing unauthorized copies of a copyrighted

work."<a href="int_fn.html#fn3">[11]</a>  This was enough to convince the court

that plaintiff's distribution rights had been infringed.  The Frena court, in

reaching this conclusion, may have opened a can of worms given the current

state of copyright law.<p>

	Returning to our hypothetical Web-novel scenario, the <u>Frena</u> decision

would make our browser the recipient of a lawful distribution of the electronic

novel.  As such a lawful recipient, she would be able to re-distribute the

lawfully obtained copy pursuant to the first-sale doctrine.<a

href="int_fn.html#fn3">[12]</a>  This result should make prospective producers

of copyrighted materials reluctant to take advantage of the net as a new and

potentially profitable marketplace because, under the <u>Frena</u> decision,

any information provided on the net may be deemed a distribution which, if

authorized by the copyright holder, would comprise a "first-sale" of the

copyrighted work.  Following such a distribution, it must be remembered, the

purchaser may freely alienate the lawfully obtained copy.  The problem with

this scenario is, given the ease with which information may be transferred on

the net, a content-provider's control over its product should extend as far as

possible.  <p>

	An information transaction on the net rarely involves the destruction of the

original copy.  When content is transferred from one site to another, as

described in the hypothetical used above, the orginal copy is generally

maintained by the producer.  Transferring information like this is more like

reproduction than distribution.  By treating these transactions as

reproductions, a copyright holder's rights over these transactions may be more

carefully safeguarded.<p>

	The plaintiffs in <u>Frena</u> probably pursued their distribution claim in

lieu of a reproduction claim because defendant's only act of reproduction was

the copying of the photographs into digitized form onto the hard drives of his

system.  The subsequent reproductions over the phone lines into other people's

computers occurred not by the acts of the defendant, but by those of the

numerous people who chose to download the pictures.  By making the distribution

claim, plaintiffs could allege that every transfer over the phone lines to the

public was an infringing act by one specific defendant rather than alleging

violations by perhaps hundred of infringers.  But the distribution analysis

puts the burden on information providers instead of where it belongs, the

consuming public.  It is like making a library liable for the unauthorized

reproductions of a borrower.  This situation will stifle the content providing

market on the Internet. <p>

	By treating such transactions as reproductions, the use of the NII and

Internet may be encouraged without the first-sale alienation problems

associated with treating such transactions as distributions.  If Web browsers

are treated as recipients of lawful distributions then, without the further

treatment of such transactions as reproductions, the recipients could

presumably establish their own Web sites which may include their lawfully

distributed copies of copyrighted information.  Others could then browse the

first-sale recipient's Web site and receive further lawful copies pursuant to

the first-sale doctrine without compensating the producer of the work.  Such a

scenario  would involve the proliferation of countless lawful copies without

benefitting the original producer.  This would clearly be a disincentive for

producers of copyrighted materials to take advantage of the Internet or the NII

as a medium for their works.  			Information transactions such as those

outlined in the hypothetical and described in <u>Frena</u> should be treated as

reproductions.  The only practical problem with treating these transactions as

reproductions is the fact that the recipients will most reasonably be

interpreted as the reproducers.  In <u>Frena</u>, this would mean plaintiffs

should have sued the recipients as well as the supplier of the infringing

information.  For most net transactions tracking down the recipients of

unlawfully reproduced information will be a herculean task compared with suing

the distributors.  But, as the law stands, the distribution of lawfully

obtained copies is legal pursuant to the first-sale doctrine while reproduction

of such copies is not.<a href="int_fn.html#fn4">[13]</a><p>

	To guard against this loop-hole which could result in the lawful proliferation

of copies without compensation to the producers as noted above, the Working

Group on Intellectual Property Rights, a sub-group of the Information

Infrastructure Task Force established by President Clinton, has proposed that

Section 109 of the Copyright Act, which embodies the first-sale doctrine, be

amended as follows:<p>

(a)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3), the owner of a

particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person

authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright

owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or

phonorecord.<p>

<p>

(2) This subsection does not apply to the sale or other disposal of the

possession of that copy or phonorecord by transmission.<a

href="int_fn.html#fn5">[14]</a><p>

<p>

This amendment is proposed pursuant to the Task Force's recognition that

transactions on the net frequently involve both the reproduction and

distribution of the reproduction simultaneously.<a

href="int_fn.html#fn6">[15]</a>  It would adequately resolve the difficulties

which might arise under the current copyright law as applied to the Internet

and, eventually, the NII.<p>

CONCLUSION<p>

	It is clear that, if content providers are to be encouraged to use the

Internet and the forthcoming NII to develop the emerging information economy,

the law as it stands is inadequate to protect their interests.  Software

authors and creators of other digital content must be wary of the loop-hole

described above.  They should lobby for the adoption of the Task Force's

proposed amendment.  But this amendment is a compromise of sorts.  It does not

recognize the simple fact that apparent distributions over the net are actually

reproductions.  Recognition of this fact alone would solve the dillema posed by

the law as it stands and pave the way for content providers to safely stake

their claims on this narrowing frontier.<p>
