January 8, 1996   

ELECTRIC UTILITY STOCKS FINISH 1995 AND START 1996 WITH STRONG GAINS

   Almost all electric utility stocks gained sharply in price--though not
as much as stocks overall--in 1995, erasing the losses of 1994 (EUW, 9 Jan
'95, 6).
   The gains continued in the first two trading sessions of this year, with
32 of the electric stocks on the New York Stock Exchange hitting new
52-week highs. Utility bonds also were near the 52-week highs reached at
the end of 1995.
   The Dow Jones Industry Group Performance Index for electric utilities
closed Dec. 29, 1995 at 259.73, up 23.54% from Dec. 30, 1994, and up 3.36
points from Dec. 31, 1993.
   On Jan. 3, 1996, the electric IGPI closed at 262.48, up 24.23% from Jan.
3, 1995, and its highest close since 267.53, on Nov. 1, 1993. The all-time
high remains 280.25, on Sept. 13, 1993.
   The Dow Jones Utilities, New York Stock Exchange Utilities, and Standard
& Poor's Utilities also set new 52-week highs on Jan. 3, 1996. The 228.27
close for the DJUA was up 24.72% from Jan. 3, 1995, and was its highest
close since 229.30, on Dec. 31, 1993.
   Ninety-six of the 103 publicly-traded electrics ended 1995 with price
gains, the most since 99 in 1991. Only six ended the year down, the fewest
since six in 1986. One was unchanged. In 1994, only four gained in price
and 99 lost.
   The Dow Jones Index of 10 utility bonds closed Dec. 29, 1995 at 102.06,
up 1,286 basis points or 14.42% from Dec. 30, 1994. The yield on these
bonds fell from 8.59% to 6.99%.
   On Jan. 3, 1996, the utility bond average also closed at 102.06, up
14.43% from Jan. 3, 1995. Their yield was 6.98%, down from 8.59% on Jan. 3,
1995.
   The 52-week high for utility bonds was 102.30, reached Dec. 28, 1995.
Also that day, the yield reached a 52-week low of 6.97%.
   On Jan. 3, 1996, the average yield on U.S. Treasury securities maturing
in one to 10 years hit a new 52-week low of 5.31%, down 248 basis points or
31.84% from Jan. 3, 1995.
   The yield on those maturing in 10 years or more also hit a new 52-week
low, at 6.17%, down 196 basis points or 24.11% from Jan. 3, 1995.
   Following are the electric stocks which hit new 52-week highs on Jan. 3
and 4. The number of new highs reached this year--if more than one--is in
parentheses, followed by the date and price of the latest new high,
followed by that day's closing price, if different:

NIMO SEEKS FERC ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST N.Y. PSC ON `QF' PAYMENTS

   Niagara Mohawk Power wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to
bring an enforcement action against the New York Public Service Commission
to bar it from implementing a 1991 state law requiring utilities to make
tax reimbursement payments to qualifying facilities.
   NiMo told FERC the law has required it to pay a total of almost
$18-million since 1991.
   The state legislature directs the PSC to order utilities to reimburse
QFs for natural gas import tax payments that the state requires QFs to pay
on fuel used to generate power that is sold to the utilities.
   According to NiMo, the state law is preempted by the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act and FERC's PURPA rules. ``The PSC cannot both obey
the New York statute and heed its obligations under Sec. 210 of PURPA,''
NiMo said (Docket No. EL96-26).
   The legislature imposed a monthly ``privilege tax'' on certain gas
importers amounting to 4.25% of the price paid for gas imported into the
state for use or consumption there. For cogenerating QFs, the amount of gas
taxed is that used in producing power for sale to utilities; the law
exempts gas used to produce power or steam for steam hosts.
   Utilities may pass the payments through in fuel-cost adjustments.
   NiMo itself paid about $7.2-million in 1994 and $4.8-million in 1995
through Sept. 30. The company projected it will pay between $7.2-million in
1996 and $13.5-million in the year 2006.
   FERC's 1995 rulings in cases involving Connecticut Power & Light and
Southern California Edison ``leave no room for doubt that this New York
statute is preempted'' because it requires utilities to pay avoided cost
rates to QFs, NiMo said.

YANKEE ROWE SETTLEMENT FEATURES COST SAVINGS BECAUSE OF BARNWELL REOPENING

   Yankee Atomic Electric has filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission an offer of settlement among parties in its decommissioning rate
case (Docket No. ER95-835).
   The decommissioning collection schedule is premised on an assumed
decommissioning cost of $306.4-million in 1995 dollars and trust fund
earnings assumptions specified in the package. The cost is lower than
proposed early last year because of unexpected availability of the
Barnwell, S.C., waste disposal site.
   The company, which is owned by and supplies 10 New England utilities
with nuclear power from its 185-MW plant in Rowe, Mass., said adoption of
the settlement would not set a precedent for any other plant or for any
future proceeding on Yankee.
   Signing the settlement are the attorneys general of Massachusetts and
Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities & Carriers, and
the Town of Norwood, Mass.
   Yankee is now decommissioning the plant. Last March, it submitted a
wholesale rate case to FERC based on an updated decommissioning cost study
that incorporated the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of the
decommissioning plan, the Dept. of Energy's plans for accepting Yankee's
spent fuel for disposal, and updated assumptions on disposal of the plant's
low-level waste.
   Yankee's March 31 filing was based on an estimated decommissioning cost
of $352.3-million and a determination that annual collections of
$58.2-million through June 2000 would be needed to fund that amount. The
estimate assumed that Yankee would not be able to start certain major
dismantlement activity until 2003, because a low-level waste disposal
facility was not available.
   On July 1, however, South Carolina reopened the Barnwell facility to
waste generators outside the Southeast Compact states. Yankee computed then
that Barnwell's availability would allow the company to start sooner and
cut the total cost to $303.2-million, with annual collections of
$45.3-million.
   The settlement details how the cost will be allocated. It also specifies
that if Barnwell becomes unavailable, Yankee will notify FERC and will
increase its monthly collection to reflect a $50-million annual charge.

HOUSE-SENATE TELECOM COMPROMISE SEEN PROTECTING UTILITY CONSUMERS

   House and Senate conferees on telecommunications reform legislation have
agreed on language allowing registered utility holding companies to offer
telecom services; sources say the compromise language gives electricity
consumers more protection than legislation approved last year by the
Senate.
   The Senate last summer approved telecom reform legislation that would
have carved out an exemption for utility telecom affiliates from SEC
regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act (EUW, 19 June '95,
3). The only consumer protections in that bill were provisions allowing
state regulators to audit and examine the telecom operating company's books
and records.
   The conferees' compromise retains the provisions giving states audit
authority and access to telecom affiliate books and records, but it also
would require state approval of transfers of telecom assets out of an
operating company's rate base, according to sources familiar with the
language.
   The compromise also includes another change that industry sources said
are favorable to utilities and consumers alike: The establishment of a new
kind of entity, the exempt telecommunications company (ETC), which would be
exempt from PUHCA regulation as long as its sole purpose is to provide
telecom services.
   ``The idea follows the Energy Policy Act and the creation of the exempt
wholesale generator,'' an attorney familiar with the compromise said. ``The
ETC has to be a single-purpose subsidiary. If it is single purpose, then it
qualifies. Once it qualifies and it is an ETC, the asset transfer provision
kicks in, and the state must approve all asset transfers.''
   The compromise also would require that the Securities & Exchange
Commission be notified of any issuance of securities related to ETCs. If on
the basis of that report, the SEC wants more information, the ETC must
provide it.
   The legislation also prohibits the use of utility assets as collateral
for ETC investments, and includes a provision that gives states the
authority to approve contracts among operating companies, utility holding
companies and ETCs.
   ``This is a significant additional protection for consumers over and
above what the Senate bill contained,'' the attorney said.
   The compromise only narrowly addresses the so-called ``Ohio Power''
issue, which refers to a federal court ruling that the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission cannot review transactions between holding company
affiliates already approved by the SEC.
   ``The compromise establishes no SEC preemption under `Ohio Power' for
contracts between affiliates in the area of telecommunications,'' the
attorney said. Instead, it stresses that the Federal Communications
Commission and the states have jurisdiction.
   The language also gives exempt utility holding companies the ability to
offer telecom services ``without limitation,'' according to the attorney.
   Sources said the breakthrough came despite opposition by Rep. John
Dingell (D-Mich.), ranking minority member of the House Commerce Committee
and an ardent champion of PUHCA.
   One source said Dingell's opposition to giving PUHCA exemptions remains
strong, but that a determined effort by Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) to give
registereds the ability to offer telecom carried the day.
   ``This compromise has more to do with how much Trent Lott wanted it than
with anything else,'' this source said.
   Despite this compromise, the telecom legislation is not likely to move
quickly, sources agreed. Significant issues involving the ownership of
multiple news media outlets, various broadcast issues and other problems
remain to be resolved before the legislation returns to the House and
Senate for approval.
   Meanwhile, utility industry officials are continuing their lobbying
efforts to persuade House conferees to reject a Senate proposal backed by
the cable television industry that utility officials say could hike their
share of the costs of using and maintaining their poles by 50%.
   The Senate proposal is the latest wrinkle in the three-year fight
between cable companies and utilities over how to divide the cost of
attachments to utility poles.
   While this issue may appear small compared with the multi-billion-dollar
market at stake in the telecom industry restructuring debate, utility
officials are taking it very seriously. They say utilities and their
customers would see millions of dollars in increased pole maintenance costs
if the Senate proposal becomes law.
   Cable companies currently pay for their pole attachments at a subsidized
rate set by regulators under legislation approved years ago by Congress
when cable was a fledgling industry.
   But now that cable is everywhere, and that industry is ready to slug it
out with telephone companies for telecom customers, utilities say it is
time for them to pay a market rate, or at least a fair share, for their
pole attachments.
   Under legislation approved by the House, telecom providers would share
the fully allocated costs of their attachments, including repair and
allocation costs. Cable companies that offer only television service would
continue to pay at the current incremental rates, but if they offer telecom
services they would have to pay fully allocated costs.
   The Senate-passed telecom reform bill includes a complicated formula for
allocating pole attachment costs that would raise cable costs slightly, and
raise utilities' costs by about 38%.
   Under a proposal offered as a compromise by Senate conferees last month,
cable companies actually would pay less than under the Senate-passed bill,
while utilities would see their costs increase by 50%, according to an
industry analysis.
   If a utility company had 500,000 poles used by cable and telcos it would
lose $5.75-million per year under the Senate provision, and $8-million
annually under the new Senate proposal.

EPRI ANALYSIS SAYS ELECTRICAL WORKERS HAVE 10-20% MORE RISK OF BRAIN
CANCER

   A new Electric Power Research Institute analysis of previous studies of
possible health risks associated with electromagnetic fields concludes that
electrical workers are about 10% to 20% more likely to develop brain cancer
than other workers.
   But because no clear relationship can be found between the amount of
exposure to EMF and the level of risk, researchers cannot conclude that
EMFs cause brain cancer, the analysis said.
   EPRI researcher Leeka Kheifets and University of California scientists
Abdelmonem Afifi, Patricia Buffler and Zhong Zhang performed a
``meta-analysis'' of 29 studies of EMF and brain cancer conducted from 1983
to 1994 in 12 countries. A meta-analysis is an examination of multiple
studies to determine what common conclusions can be drawn.
   About a third of the studies were conducted in the U.S., another third
in Scandinavia, and the remainder in Canada, Australia, Great Britain,
Germany and other countries. The earliest study was published in 1983,
while the largest number of studies, six, appeared in 1991.
   About half of the studies included follow-up before 1984 and were
published before 1990. Study designs used by the investigators included
proportional mortality, case-control analysis of death certificate data,
case control, and cohort studies.
   The EPRI study, published in the December issue of the Journal of
Occupational and Environmental Medicine, said most of the studies indicated
only a small elevation in risk, but noted ``considerable heterogeneity
among the results.''
   The U.S. and other studies showed relative risk increases of 40% or
higher compared to those with no occupational exposures to EMFs. The
Scandinavian studies, almost all of which were cohort studies based on
incident risk, showed the lowest relative risks for brain cancer. The
reasons for the lower relative risk reported in the Scandinavian studies
``are not exactly clear,'' the EPRI study said.
   To obtain the estimate of an increased risk of 10% to 20% for electrical
workers, the EPRI study adjusted each of the 29 studies' individual
findings according to a formula based on 15 criteria, including quality of
information, adequacy of design, possible biases and specificity of data.
   The research team said the body of evidence examined in the study allows
three possible interpretations: no association exists between occupational
exposure to EMF and the risk of cancer; a small effect exists, and
inconsistencies among studies reflects biases in the studies; the true EMF
exposure effect is large, but affects only a small number of individuals
who are somehow ``preconditioned.''
   ``We believe that this meta-analysis provides some evidence against the
hypothesis of no association between occupational exposure to EMF and the
risk of cancer, provides some evidence to support the hypothesis of a small
pervasive effect, and provides no clues that could help to identify a
circumstance or condition that would correspond to the third hypothesis,''
the researchers concluded.
   ``However, because of the lack of adequate exposure information and a
clear dose-response pattern, in is not possible to conclude that EMF is
causally associated with the observed excess of brain cancer in workers
employed in electrical occupations.''

TROUBLED OKLAHOMA CO-OP DENIES ALLEGATIONS IN CLASS-ACTION SUIT

   Verdigris Valley Electric Cooperative, its economic development
subsidiary and four current and former trustees have formally denied
allegations of gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of
state and federal laws or regulations in connection with what has been
called the largest economic development loss ever sustained by a
distribution cooperative.
   The allegations were raised in a class-action lawsuit filed in October
by Cal McKinney, a member and harsh critic of the Collinsville, Okla.-based
co-op, which in October 1993 announced a $5.68-million write-off from an
economic development loan to Precision Tubulars, a metalworking firm which
went bankrupt without ever reaching full production (In the District Court
of Tulsa County, Case No. CJ-95-04552) (EUW, 23 Oct '95, 11).
   McKinney's suit was designed to make co-op members financially whole.
   In his answer on behalf of the co-op, Tulsa attorney Stephen Riley also
asserted that losses from the Precision deal were ``due to circumstances
beyond [defendants'] control.'' He also asserted that an Oklahoma law
requiring member approval before a co-op can encumber or otherwise dispose
of a ``substantial'' portion of its assets does not apply in this case.
   The co-op admits loaning Precision $6.79-million, but denies that this
constituted a substantial portion of its assets. VVEC's current annual
report lists total assets of $57-million.
   Riley also contends that McKinney lacks standing to represent other
co-op members, and contends that the suit is barred by the two-year statute
of limitations. He said McKinney knew or should have known of the losses to
VVEC members before it was officially announced at the October 1993 annual
meeting because of news accounts of Precision's problems starting in 1991.
   Riley said that former general manager Doyle Fulton and five current and
former trustees also named as defendants are not covered by the answer
because they have not yet been officially served with copies of the
lawsuit. An amended answer will be filed once they are served, he said.
   Riley's answer lists nine grounds on which he contends the suit should
be dismissed, but also indicated that the defendants acknowledge a need for
further discovery and investigation.
   No procedural schedule has been set for the case, but the discovery
process is expected to be extremely lengthy and complex. This litigation
marks the first time when all aspects of the Precision deal and VVEC's
involvement in it has been subject to court review. A Washington County
civil case involving much narrower issues generated one of the largest
court files in that county's history.

FERC ALJ RULING ON SYNFUELS PROJECT COULD HIT BASIN ELECTRIC CO-OP HARD

   The Great Plains Synfuels Plant near Beulah, N.D., could be forced to
shut down and Basin Electric Power Cooperative could suffer negative
financial, rate, and capacity consequences as a result if a preliminary
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruling issued Dec. 29 is ultimately
affirmed.
   According to Basin Electric, settlement agreements stemming from the
long and troubled history of the Great Plains plant were struck in April
1994 with the Dakota Gasification Company (DGC), a non-regulated subsidiary
of the cooperative, and certain pipeline companies. The agreements
stipulate that synthetic gas from Great Plains is to be purchased by the
pipelines at defined prices above the market price over a seven-year
period.
   However, in FERC proceedings on the prudence of these accords, gas
consumer groups challenged these provisions and on Dec. 29 a FERC
administrative law judge ruled that the stipulated gas pricing and purchase
provisions were invalid. He recommended setting a new price equal to the
Gulf Coast index plus 5%.
   Dakota Gasification Co.'s current cost of producing synthetic gas is
$2.60/dekatherm. According to DGC vice president Kent Janssen, the new
price set by the ALJ ``comes nowhere near covering costs.''
   ``For the judge to suggest DGC can survive with that price is
ludicrous,'' Janssen declared.
   A shutdown of Great Plains would cost Basin Electric more than
$25-million annually in lost revenue, a utility spokesman said. In
addition, it could force the utility to raise the electric rates of its 126
member co-ops by an estimated 10% and would idle about 100 MW of the
900-MW, two-unit Antelope power station. ``We would not look at this as a
great bonanza,'' the spokesman said.
   Based on these concerns, DGC said it will vigorously challenge the ALJ's
ruling. All parties have 30 days from Dec. 29 to file exceptions with FERC.
Janssen said DGC plans to file within that period.

CANADA'S ALBERTA LAUNCHES SWEEPING RESTRUCTURING OF WHOLESALE MARKET

   The province of Alberta, Canada, launched a sweeping restructuring of
the wholesale power industry on Jan. 1 that is the first to go into
operation in North America, with transmission separated from generation.
   So far, only wholesale transactions are involved, although a study will
be conducted soon on whether changes are needed that would usher in retail
wheeling as well.
   ``The lights are on, the new system is working properly,'' said Larry
Charach, senior director of electric policy for the Alberta Dept. of
Energy, which has overseen the restructuring. Some pool workers have been
working up to 40 hours straight to get the new system running.
   ``We expect in the long term, rates will be lower because we are
bringing in competitive forces,'' said Charach. ``Without the
restructuring, rates could have risen 20% within a few years.'' Pool rates
on Jan. 3 were about (U.S.) $7/MWh for on-peak power and about $4/MWh for
off-peak power.
   The new Power Pool of Alberta will be a clearing house for all power
sold within the province and for deals utilities strike with other
utilities, independent producers or power marketers from outside the
province in Canada or the United States.
   The pool functions as a spot market for all buying and selling of power
at hourly prices established by suppliers and purchasers bidding into the
pool.
   Incorporated into the pool were all existing generating units of the
province's three major utilities--TransAlta Utilities, Alberta Power and
Edmonton Power. The generation will be allocated to existing customers,
based on unamortized original or historic costs.
   The customers include generating utilities and distribution utilities
such as the cities of Calgary, Lethbridge and Red Deer. The three cities
have just awarded ZE PowerGroup of Richmond, British Columbia, a contract
to manage their power marketing and negotiate contracts with individual
suppliers, said Zak El-Ramly, ZE PowerGroup president. The cities can buy
separately or as a group, with a total of more than 1,100 MW of buying
power.
   Gerry Roberts, Calgary's manager of sales and services, said each city
is entitled to an allotment from the pool. Calgary previously bought all of
its power from TransAlta Utilities, which is based in Calgary.
   TransAlta, Edmonton Power, Alberta Power and the city of Calgary have
formed Grid Co. of Alberta Inc. (Gridco), which pools the operation of
their transmission into a single system. The utilities will retain
ownership of their wires. Transmission costs will be averaged so that the
rate will be the same province-wide.
   Open access would be provided on a non-discriminatory basis to all. This
includes independent power producers, which are expected to be the ones
building any new power plants needed in Alberta in the future.
   Since 1982, under the Alberta Electric Energy Marketing Act, utilities
within the province had averaged generation and transmission costs because
without the deal, rates of some utilities would have been dramatically
higher.
   But driving the need for change were complaints from TransAlta that it
was subsidizing ratepayers of other utilities. Industrial customers also
were claiming they were paying too much for power.

ELCON ISSUES `ROAD MAP' TO COMPETITION WITH STRANDED-COST RECOVERY FORMULA

   The Electricity Consumers Resource Council last week issued a ``Road Map
for the Transition'' designed to respond to criticisms that its ``Blueprint
for Customer Choice'' lacked specifics--particularly in the area of
stranded investment.
   The Edison Electric Institute quickly denounced the so-called road map
as ``full of dead ends and some pretty deep potholes.'' EEI criticized the
proposal as a one-size-fits-all imposition of a federal structure on the
country's electric system that will benefit ELCON's members ``at the
expense of everyone else.''
   Nevertheless, with its road map to retail competition ELCON once again
has seized the initiative in the national debate over the future structure
of the electric industry. It offers what is seen as the first comprehensive
restructuring proposal--but probably not the last.
   When ELCON released its blueprint in September, it purposely glossed
over the stranded-cost issue. Shortly thereafter, Rep. Dan Schaefer
(R-Colo.) and William Massey of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
challenged the group to come forward with specific proposals addressing
stranded-cost recovery.
   ELCON's answer to those challenges is a complicated five-step process
featuring a formula for dividing up responsibility for unmitigable stranded
investment. The formula assigns a ``responsibility factor'' to utilities,
which would be determined by state regulators according to how efficiently
a utility responded to regulatory mandates and whether the company opposed
the mandates in the first place.
   A utility would be required to absorb at least 50% of its unmitigable
stranded costs, but in practice it probably would have to bear a greater
share. In a nutshell, the formula starts by assigning stranded costs
equally between ratepayers and shareholders, with the responsibility factor
deciding how much of the ratepayers' 50% share the utility would be
required to absorb in addition to its 50% share.
   But the formula only would be applied after state regulators conduct
what ELCON is billing as ``the last great rate case'' to determine what
sunk costs are not mitigable. In the alternative, the utility could opt to
sell its generation assets as a means of determining stranded costs.
   Stranded-cost recovery mechanisms would be subject to negotiation with
individual customers and classes of customers. Regulators would decide
recovery in the absence of a negotiated settlement. The utility would have
no more than five years to recover its stranded costs.
   ELCON executive director John Anderson called the road map's
stranded-cost provisions a ``statesmanlike'' effort to end the impasse
between ELCON and EEI over stranded-cost recovery. Historically, ELCON has
rejected any level of stranded-cost recovery in response to EEI's position
that utilities are entitled to 100% recovery. With its proposal on the
table, the issue of stranded-cost recovery is now open to negotiation,
Anderson suggested.
   But EEI president Thomas Kuhn called ELCON's proposal on stranded costs
a nonstarter. The formula, designed to ensure little if any stranded-cost
recovery, does not represent any change in ELCON's position, he said.
   ``I don't see that there's anything new in the ELCON proposal,'' Kuhn
said in an appearance before the Washington International Energy Group.
``We don't see a bargaining chip here at all.''
   Kuhn cited ``leading economists,'' FERC and most states as endorsing
EEI's position that utilities are entitled to 100% recovery. He predicted
that ELCON's complicated proposal will be rejected by the states.
   ELCON's road map proposes a three-year transition to retail competition
featuring a ``customer election period'' based on the telephone industry
experience. No later than the mid-point of the three-year transition
period, state regulators would feature a ``Day One'' designating the
beginning of the customer election period. As of that date, every customer
would have the right to choose an electric service provider. Customers
would be notified at least six months prior to ``Day One'' of their right
to switch from their utility provider.
   At the end of the transition, all generation assets will have been
removed from rate base. The generation company may continue to sell the
asset's power to its affiliated--or previously affiliated--distribution
company beyond the transition period under terms of a transition contract
approved by the state.
   Transition contracts also would provide for ancillary and backup
services to qualifying facilities under the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act. The utility PURPA Reform Group criticized this aspect of the
proposal as setting the stage for ``the last great PURPA land rush.'' The
group called it inconsistent to deny utilities stranded costs while
committing them indefinitely to the purchase of QF power.
   But ELCON's Anderson rejected utility complaints about uneconomic QF
contracts as ``a thing of the past.'' No utility is entering into high-cost
contracts with PURPA facilities today, he said. The importance of PURPA's
Section 210 is not its mandatory purchase provision, but the section's
requirements that utilities provide backup and ancillary services to QFs.
   As a check against market power, ELCON's road map calls for operational
unbundling of vertically integrated utilities using the Dept. of Justice's
methodology. While free market entry is an important check, it is not
sufficient in and of itself, the group said. Transmission assets would be
turned over to an independent system operator and controls would be placed
on interaffiliate pricing of transmission services and interaffiliate
distribution transactions.
   EEI's Kuhn dismissed ELCON's ``specious'' concerns about utility market
power and industry concentration. The electric utility industry is a great
deal less concentrated than the telephone industry or most ELCON members,
Kuhn asserted.
   ELCON further proposed that, during the first two years of the
transition, owners of FERC-regulated transmission facilities would be
required to file regional transmission group proposals. Siting of new
interstate transmission systems would become FERC's responsibility. ELCON
also proposed establishment of unregulated Private Delivery Systems, or
PDSs, such as a line linking two industrial facilities.
   If a new transmission line is built privately and without the exercise
of eminent domain, then the line would be unregulated. Owners of existing
transmission systems could petition FERC for a license to opt out from rate
regulation if the owner can show it does not exercise market power and the
line was not sited through the power of eminent domain. The unregulated
privately owned transmission facilities would provide competitive pressures
on monopoly transmission providers, ELCON suggested.
   Independent System operator franchises would be granted for finite
periods in order to allow others the opportunity to competitively bid for
the right to serve the franchise, ELCON proposed.
   Local distribution services would be unbundled with traditional
distribution functions split between the ``wires'' business and the
electric services merchant business under the proposal.
   ELCON also proposes establishment of joint federal-state boards to make
recommendations for state legislative actions to ensure universal service.
   The road map places much of the responsibility for the outcome of the
transition with state regulators, said ELCON's Anderson. The proposal is
intended to put to rest concerns of state regulators that ELCON advocates
``federalizing the system,'' he said: ``The states are going to have a
whole lot to do'' if the road map is implemented.
   ELCON's road map is ``pretty bold,'' but on first reading is not
specific enough to rebut complaints that the industry group seeks to
federalize electricity policy, said Charles Gray, assistant general counsel
for the National Assn. of Regulatory Utility Commissioners.
   EEI attacked the road map as ``shifting significant authority away from
the states to the federal government.'' EEI's Kuhn called for allowing
individual states to continue experimenting while FERC irons out its
rulemaking on wholesale open access.
   ``A lot more questions need to be answered,'' said NARUC's Gray. ``But
it's a discussion draft and you have to give them credit for that.''
   NARUC shipped the proposal out to its membership last week, Gray said,
citing a high degree of interest in it among state regulators. ``How you
sort out the transition is of high interest to NARUC,'' Gray said.
   The proposal also is the subject of strong interest on Capitol Hill.
ELCON's Anderson is a featured speaker at a conference in Colorado this
week, on an agenda that features Rep. Dan Schaefer (R-Colo.), chairman of
the House energy and power subcommittee, who is spearheading legislation to
promote retail competition and the end of utility monopoly regulation.
   Anderson downplayed the weight ELCON's proposal will carry with Schaefer
as he drafts his legislative proposal. ``I'm not naive enough to think we
are going to write the bill,'' Anderson said.

FEDERAL BUDGET IMPASSE PROMPTS FERC TO POSTPONE DATE FOR COMMENTS ON EIS

   The showdown between Congress and the administration over the federal
budget has prompted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to postpone
the Jan. 8 deadline for comments on its draft environmental impact
statement on the air pollution consequences of the open-access transmission
rulemaking.
   The postponement is in response to requests from officials at the
Environmental Protection Agency and other federal agencies shut down by the
budget impasse, preventing those agencies from preparing comments.
   FERC said it will publish a future notice establishing a new deadline.
It remains to be seen whether the delay in the EIS process will force a
similar delay by FERC in finalizing the open-access rulemaking, proposed
March 29, 1995. FERC had hoped to issue the final rule this spring.

N.Y. PSC LAW JUDGE RECOMMENDS FORMING AN ISO FOR TRANSITION TO RETAIL
ACCESS

   New York should establish an independent system operator to formalize
wholesale competition and ensure a smooth transition to retail access, a
state administrative law judge has recommended.
   The judge's recommendation--issued as part of the state's Competitive
Opportunities proceeding--also calls for separating transmission and
distribution from generation and for recovering stranded costs with an
access charge imposed by a distribution company.
   The recommended decision was filed Dec. 22 by the state's Department of
Public Service administrative law judge Judith Lee and Ronald Liberty,
deputy director for the Energy and Water Division. It is subject to review
by the state's Public Service Commission, which will ultimately accept,
modify or reject it. The proceeding itself, which solicited proposals to
restructure the state's electric utility market, is aimed at lowering New
York's high electric rates.
   Key parts of the more than 200-page review:
   -- Strandable costs ``may be made unrecoverable by the transition from
regulation to a competitive market for electricity.'' These costs, the
decision states, could be recovered by a separate mechanism outside the
market, such as a non-bypassable access charge or wires charge imposed by a
distribution company;
   -- Transmission and distribution should be separate from generation, Lee
suggests, ``in order to limit the exercise of market power,'' and T&D
companies will need to serve all would-be buyers in the short term.
   Lee sees as ``critical'' the reliability of the bulk power system and
suggests that it should not be sacrificed in any way in order to achieve
the potential price reduction that may be associated with a system of
retail access. Therefore, ``effective competition at the wholesale level
should be established first, with an eye toward adding retail access as
rapidly as possible once a market is established and reliability is
ensured.''
   No timetable for the ``as rapidly as possible'' transition to retail
access has been established, a PSC spokesperson told Electric Utility
Week.
   Lee's recommendation was a ``tremendous disappointment'' to New York
industrials ``and to any advocate of full and open retail competition,''
said Barbara Brenner, counsel to Multiple Interveners, the industrial users
group. ``It delays, without schedule, retail competition and, in fact,
appears to delay even the implementation of wholesale competition for two
years.''
   Utilities, on the other hand, liked the proposal. Their trade group, the
Energy Assn. of New York State, applauded the law judge's recommendation as
``a thoughtful approach to what is clearly an incredibly complex series of
issues.''
   ``Wholesale competition to the extent that the Energy Association has
been talking about is far more significant than what might exist today in
New York--and in most other places,'' said Howard Shapiro, the
association's president.

NYMEX PRESIDENT PREDICTS REGULATORY ACTION SOON, MARCH LAUNCH OF FUTURES

   Patrick Thompson, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, last
week predicted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will act on the
exchange's two proposed electricity futures contracts before the end of the
month, which could allow trading to begin by the end of March or early in
the second quarter of this year.
   NYMEX filed supplemental information on its proposed futures contracts
with the CFTC late last month. The material, responding to commission
inquiries concerning the deliverability of the commodity and potential
regulation of electricity futures by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, was filed under a claim of confidentiality and was not made
publicly available.
   The confidential filing cleared the way for CFTC staff to begin
preparing a memorandum for consideration by the commission. The four
sitting commissioners likely will begin considering whether to approve the
contracts later this month, according to a CFTC source.
   Assuming the supplemental filing from NYMEX answers all the questions
raised by the CFTC staff, the memorandum now being drafted could be sent to
the commission within two weeks, the CFTC source said.
   ``I'm really confident now that the CFTC has had all of its questions
answered--both technical and regulatory,'' NYMEX's Thompson said in a
telephone interview last week. ``I expect the approval process to conclude
very quickly.''
   NYMEX is expected to launch both contracts at the same time. The two
contracts are virtually identical, except for the physical delivery points
at the Palo Verde nuclear station switchyard and the California/Oregon
border intertie. The exchange plans to let the markets decide whether one
or both futures contracts will be sustained in the long term.
   With the road seemingly clear for launch of the western contracts, NYMEX
is beginning to focus on developing an eastern futures contract.
   NYMEX's advisory group is considering at least three systems for a
potential delivery point for a futures contract in the East, according to
sources. Those systems are the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland
Interconnection, the Tennessee Valley Authority and American Electric
Power. The Southern Company's system is also seen as a possible delivery
point, sources said.

UTILITIES SEE GM'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE PLAN INTRODUCING `EXCITING NEW ERA'

   General Motors' announcement last week that it will market a new
electric passenger car and an electric pickup truck this fall ``shows that
electric vehicles are ready to play a significant role'' in reducing
pollution, the Edison Electric Institute declared. EEI has been pushing for
EV development for several years, largely against automakers' resistance.
   The announcement ``marks the beginning of an exciting new era in
transportation,'' according to EEI. Not only do utilities want EVs for
their emission-reduction power, which could ease pressure to get more
reductions from power plants, but they want them for their addition to
off-peak loads.
   GM's plan--to sell the vehicles in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, and
Tucson--was made public at the Los Angeles Auto Show. It came in the wake
of California Air Resources Board action easing its EV sales requirement in
the state. Some sources said the automaker's plan was a quid pro quo for
the CARB decision.
   ``We have worked with General Motors cooperatively over many years in
clean, energy-efficient transportation technology,'' said EEI vice
president Tom Morron, ``and we look forward to helping them introduce these
cars in any way we can. Even now, for example, more than 80 electric
utilities have pledged to purchase electric fleet vehicles and tonight,
many of those fleet managers are preparing to contact local dealers around
the country for information on the electric S-series pickup--a real truck,
from a real truck maker.''
   Besides selling a car, GM also said it will market an electric pickup
truck, a converted Chevrolet S-10, nationwide in 1997 for use in commercial
fleets. The company has not set production volumes for either vehicle, a
spokesman said, but will ``let the market decide'' how many to build.
   An advancement of GM's Impact prototype, the two-seat EV1 will feature a
price tag in the mid-$30,000 range. The EV1's lead acid batteries will
provide a 70- to 90-mile driving range, depending on weather and driving
habits, the spokesman said.
   The car will be marketed through Saturn dealerships in Los Angeles, San
Diego, Phoenix and Tucson.
   In a separate announcement, Southern California Edison said it opened
its first electric charging station Wednesday at a retail outlet--a
Wal-Mart store in the City of Industry--and plans to open more in
partnership with Wal-Mart. SoCal Ed paid for the charging ports while
Wal-Mart paid to have the electrical circuitry installed and it also will
pay the electricity costs.
   SoCal Ed hopes to install between 50 and 100 charging stations around
Los Angeles in the next year to test how they will be used. The utility and
the Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power already have 75 charging stations
at utility headquarters and branches.
   According to GM's announcement, the EV1 is equipped with dual airbags,
anti-lock brakes, a CD player and cruise control. ``It is the world's most
aerodynamic production vehicle and it carries 23 new patents in a variety
of new technologies,'' the company said.
   Both vehicles will use the Delco Electronics Magne-Charge inductive
charging system, according to GM, which said it has already been tested and
received well by more than 500 people in GM's PrEView Drive EV test drive
program.
   One reason the company is introducing the vehicles in Southern
California and Arizona markets, an official said, is that ``they afford the
topographical and climatic conditions found to be most favorable to
electric vehicle operation.''

MOODY'S SEES HIGH PRICES, STRANDED ASSETS HURTING NORTHEAST ELECTRICS

   High prices and stranded-cost exposure make electric utilities in the
Northeast particularly vulnerable to competition, Moody's Investors Service
said in a report released at the end of December.
   ``High break-even prices and the stranded-cost exposure of the majority
of utilities in the Northeast competitive arena poorly position these
utilities to respond in a fully competitive environment.
   ``Combined with recent initiatives in the region to quicken the pace of
deregulation, Moody's expects downgrades to continue, especially in the
face of negative transition cost decisions and/or definitive moves to allow
open access,'' said analysts Julia Doetsch, Paul Fremont, Susan Abbot, and
Douglas Watson, in the report ``Northeast Break-Even Analysis.''
   Moody's defined the ``Northeast'' as the investor-owned systems within
two transmission interconnects of Con Edison, plus the Massachusetts
Municipal Wholesale Electric, New York Power Authority, Hydro Quebec, and
New Brunswick Power. It includes all of the New England and New York power
pools, plus Atlantic Electric, Delmarva Power, General Public Utilities,
Pennsylvania Power & Light, and Public Service Electric & Gas in the
Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM).
   High prices in the area reflect expensive, recently-completed nuclear
plants, and purchased-power pacts mandated by regulators, Moody's said,
adding that these costs are not likely to be fully recoverable in rates in
an ``open, price competitive market'' even though ``all principles
articulated to date [by state and federal regulators] include language
supportive of full recovery of prudent, verifiable costs arising from past
regulatory decisions.
   ``However comforting for the utilities this is meant to be, the sheer
magnitude of potential stranded investments in the region may dampen
regulatory enthusiasm--especially where rate increases would be required to
recover such transition costs. If the recovery of lost revenues associated
with authorizing rate discounting is any guide to underlying state bias for
cost sharing with regard to retail wheeling, then unbridled optimism for
full cost recovery remains generally unwarranted. Pennsylvania, offering
100% recovery for such revenue erosion, may be the exception,'' Moody's
continued.
   ``Many of these utilities--and in turn their equity holders--will be
forced to bear some of the financial pain associated with the transition.
This in turn diminishes the equity cushion available to debtholders,
resulting in negative rating pressure.''
   Moody's estimated total stranded-cost exposure in the region at
$43-billion, about 25% of the U.S. total and 45% more than the same
companies' total combined equity.
   The average Moody's senior secured debt rating for Northeastern
utilities is now ``Baa1,'' below the U.S. average of ``A3,'' though only
three--Niagara Mohawk Power, PP&L, and Northeast Utilities unit Public
Service of New Hampshire--were downgraded in 1995.
   Moody's presented ``break even'' prices--defined as ``the price it must
charge for each unit of capacity to cover fixed charges after applying all
profits or margins from energy sales''--in three ways: for installed
generation, for installed generation plus purchased power, and for those
two plus deferred assets.
   With all three included, Long Island Lighting ranks first at $317/kW,
with $7,661,000,000 in stranded costs, mostly for the ``regulatory asset''
representing future cost recovery of the abandoned Shoreham nuclear plant.
Even based only on its own generation, Lilco's break-even price is $105/kW,
first in the group.
   Ranking first in stranded costs as a percentage of equity is Central
Maine Power, at 456%. Though CMP's break-even price based on its own
generation is only $29/kW, adding purchased power boosts that to $196/kW,
and deferred assets raises it to $231/kW.
   In the best shape are NYPA, with a break-even price of $6/kW including
all costs, and Hydro Quebec, at a negative $18/kW. They have no stranded
costs, Moody's noted.
   Among the investor-owned companies, the lowest break-even price
including all costs is Central Hudson Gas & Electric, at $49/kW. It also
has the lowest stranded costs as a percentage of equity, at 10%.

UTILITIES SEEK TO EXPAND `TWO-COUNTY RULE' ALLOWING TAX-EXEMPT FINANCING

   In an interesting chapter in the ongoing brawl between investor-owned
and municipal utilities, a group of IOUs that now are able to issue
tax-exempt bonds--just as municipals do--are trying to persuade Congress to
let them expand their service territories without having to call in their
bonds immediately, as the law now requires.
   The budget reconciliation bill approved by Congress, but vetoed by
President Clinton, would make changes in the so-called ``two-county'' rule,
an obscure wrinkle in the tax code that allows a handful of investor-owned
electric and gas utilities to issue tax-exempt bonds if they meet certain
qualifications.
   As the law now stands, utilities that qualify as ``local furnishers'' of
service in an area consisting either of two contiguous counties or one
county and one city may issue tax-exempt bonds the way municipals do. Only
15 gas and electric IOUs currently qualify.
   One of these, Delmarva Power & Light, wants to expand its gas
distribution beyond the two-county limit, but does not want to call in its
bonds immediately, as the law now requires, and seek higher cost capital
elsewhere. So, Sen. William Roth (R-Del.), chairman of the Finance
Committee, inserted an amendment to the tax code that would give two-county
utilities that want to expand six months to call in their bonds.
   But Roth, who wants the federal budget balanced, added another line that
will prohibit any other IOU from becoming a two-county utility.
   Committee staff estimated that provision would save the government
$22-million annually.
   The Roth language was included in the budget bill that cleared Congress
and was vetoed by Clinton. When San Diego Gas & Electric, Consolidated
Edison, Duquesne Light, and the other utilities that enjoy two-county
status for a portion of their systems heard about Roth's language, they
began lobbying for a provision of their own.
   While the situation remains fluid, sources on Capitol Hill and officials
from investor-owned and municipal utility groups confirmed that SDG&E and
Con Ed are pushing for a new amendment that would allow them to expand
their territories and not have to call the bonds in until the full term of
the bonds expires.
   Municipals are outraged by the idea. ``We oppose this on the grounds
that it is bad public policy,'' one municipal industry lobbyist told
Electric Utility Week. ``Private entities should not benefit from public
funds. We get these bonds because we are public entities with special
obligations to the public that IOUs don't face.''
   The lobbyist said it is ``frustrating'' when IOU officials argue before
congressional panels with oversight on energy issues that municipals'
ability to issue tax-exempt bonds is anticompetitive. Some of the same
officials, the lobbyist said, want to expand the two-county rule to give a
handful of IOUs ``a better deal than they have now.''
   The SDG&E/Con Ed lobbying effort has raised eyebrows among other
industry competitors. Tony Smith, tax director and assistant comptroller
for Southern California Edison, said his company thinks the original
amendment to give companies that want to expand an extra six months to call
in their bonds ``would not be unreasonable.''
   He added, however, that SoCal Ed wants a level playing field for all
competitors. ``In general terms, while subsidies have made sense in the
past, we don't think they make sense as we go forward into greater
competition,'' Smith said.
   ``One business entity should not be receiving subsidies to the exclusion
of others. It makes sense that all business entities be treated the same
and taxed under the same rules. That opinion would apply to municipals as
well as to investor-owned companies.''
   SDG&E, which did not return telephone inquiries about its lobbying
effort, had $786-million in outstanding tax-exempt bonds at the end of
1994, according to Morgan Stanley. Con Ed had $1.635-billion in outstanding
bonds in the same year.
   Ron Clements, the Edison Electric Institute's director of governmental
affairs specializing in tax and financial issues, said the national IOU
association has no position on the provision or efforts to amend it.
   ``From a conceptual viewpoint, tax-exempt debt from a two-county
perspective has a very limited purpose,'' Clements said. ``Power has to be
produced and distributed within that two-county area. It's a limited fix
aimed at a limited number of companies.''
   Clements and others interviewed agreed that the efforts of the other
utilities to expand the Delmarva provision are likely to be dropped by
Senate staff because they are too controversial.

WESTERN RESOURCES ACQUIRES A LARGE ADT STAKE; HOPES FOR JOINT MARKETING

   Western Resources has announced an agreement to acquire 15.4-million
shares, or 11.7%, of ADT Limited stock held by Laidlaw Inc., plus an option
to acquire 15.4-million additional shares.
   The transaction, valued at $215-million, is expected to close early this
year, subject to necessary approvals, and further expands Western's
investment in the security field (EUW, 23 Oct '95, 4). ADT is the nation's
largest provider of monitored security services, and the transaction will
make Western one of ADT's largest shareholders.
   John Hayes, Jr., Western chairman, president and CEO, said the company
plans to propose to ADT the possibilities of jointly marketing Western
Resources' Westar brand energy products and services through ADT's more
than 200 sales offices in North America, the United Kingdom and Europe.
Westar offers back-up power systems, appliance repair options and a
comprehensive array of environmental and energy management programs.
   Hayes described the ADT stock acquisition as part of Western's growth
strategy, under which the company invests in businesses with attractive
natural revenue growth, which complement existing energy business lines and
which over time could provide a chance for Western to work with others to
provide a branded identity for marketing additional products and services.
   In December, Western acquired Mobilfone Security, and in November it
acquired the commercial and residential security service business of
Communications & Signaling Inc., but both those firms have operations
limited to Western's home state of Kansas.
   ADT operates in 44 states with more than one million security service
customers. It reported operating revenues of $1.5-billion for the 12 months
ending Sept. 30, 1995.

STATE OFFICIALS SEEK NEW SETTLEMENT PROVISIONS IN HYDRO RELICENSING PLAN

   A national organization of state environmental officials said it
supports key elements of a proposal by the National Hydropower Assn. to
revamp the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's hydro relicensing
procedures, but said the NHA plan needs ``more explicit accommodations for
settlement provisions.''
   The Environmental Council of the States (ECOS), a group of environmental
officials from 50 of the U.S. states and territories, praised most features
of the NHA proposal, which was filed with FERC last summer (EUW, 17 July
'95, 13). The commission in October launched a rulemaking on the issue
(Docket No. RM-16), specifically asking for comment on NHA's proposal (EUW,
6 Nov '95, 2) and whether a formal negotiated rulemaking would be a good
approach.
   NHA recently told FERC a negotiated rulemaking would give the best
chance for timely reform of the commission's relicensing procedures.
   ECOS said it likes the NHA proposal's emphasis on reducing the overall
time for reviewing FERC license applications, eliminating redundant
reports, and involving all stakeholders at the earliest time possible in
the environmental review process.
   FERC should, however, include provisions to assist state efforts to
settle disputes among stakeholders, ECOS advised, ``beyond the
encouragement given in the NHA proposal.'' The group said many of its
concerns likely could be resolved by administrative reforms and would not
necessarily require more rulemaking.
   ``Specifically, there should be provisions to ensure that formal
regulatory positions from involved agencies are not solicited by FERC on
draft [National Environmental Policy Act] documents during ongoing
settlement negotiations,'' ECOS said. ``The outcome of negotiations can
greatly accelerate NEPA reviews. Conversely, the quest for reasonable
settlement terms could also be undermined by the continued pursuit of
formal regulatory positions that might constrain the flexibility of
participants in modifying their positions to work toward agreements.''
   FERC could include ``an escape clause'' that would allow the commission
to defer regulatory steps during ongoing settlement negotiations, ECOS
said. It agreed with NHA that the commission's ex parte rules on FERC
communications with participants in the licensing process need to be
reformed.
   ``Staff interpretations of ex parte constraints can be extreme and
result in a stifling of communications and early resolution of issues
between FERC and other agencies and participants,'' ECOS said.
   ``Other agencies of government, including our own, are sensitive to ex
parte concerns and yet are able to find ways to do business without
incurring these problems. Any reform proposal for hydropower licensing must
deal with this issue.''
   ECOS questioned the NHA proposal provision that strongly encourages FERC
to enter into a memorandum of understanding with other agencies to
coordinate input on relicensing proceedings, saying that NHA makes no clear
statement on why such an MOU is necessary.
   Alternatively, ECOS suggested that regulations could mandate ``the
consolidation of federal agency input into hydropower relicensing in a
coordinated time frame.'' In addition, ECOS said the proposal would benefit
from ``specific provisions that facilitate comprehensive river basin
planning by providing financial and/or technical support.''
   ``Such planning is critical to providing a clear and reasonable context
to any cumulative impact assessment in river basins,'' ECOS continued. ``It
is essential to provide a vision of what agencies and the public want in a
river basin and not just the more traditional regulatory view of what they
don't want. This should be extremely valuable to power producers seeking to
secure their future in a given basin.''

PACIFICORP OPENS KENTUCKY OFFICE TO WRAP UP A DEAL WITH BIG RIVERS

   PacifiCorp opened an office in downtown Henderson, Ky., at the start of
the new year in hopes of wrapping up negotiations to lease and manage Big
Rivers Electric's coal plants over the next 25 years.
   The two companies expect to sign a ``letter of intent'' before the end
of January, an action that would trigger a series of state and federal
regulatory rulings over the next 12 to 18 months.
   If a deal can be reached with PacifiCorp, Big Rivers would remain
structurally intact and avoid a feared default in 1997. The co-op would
``maintain a commitment'' to the region, said Big Rivers board president
Sandra Wood. ``There would remain a strong, viable utility presence in
western Kentucky--a utility that can provide attractive rates to our
customers and act as an aggressive recruiter of industry and jobs in the
region.''
   While Big Rivers made it official in late December that PacifiCorp was
its choice for a business partner that could help the troubled co-op put to
rest more than a decade of financial problems, several unsuccessful suitors
apparently are still waiting in the wings.
   One well-placed source told Electric Utility Week that U.S. Generating,
an independent power producer, and two investor-owned utilities, CINergy
and Louisville Gas & Electric, ``think they're still in the game.'' If the
Big Rivers/PacifiCorp talks break down, these companies are ready to step
into the breach.
   So, too, is East Kentucky Power Cooperative, the other generation and
transmission cooperative in Kentucky. An East Kentucky spokesman said the
Winchester-based co-op, which is four times the size of 85,000-customer Big
Rivers, intends to keep its proposal on the table until a Big
Rivers/PacifiCorp deal becomes final.
   The selection of PacifiCorp culminated a lengthy search by Big Rivers
for a palatable solution to its $1.2-billion debt, much of which is owed to
the Rural Utilities Service. The RUS' predecessor, the Rural
Electrification Administration, loaned most of the money needed to
construct the 440-MW D.B. Wilson coal plant near Matanzas, Ky., in the
early 1980s.
   Wilson, the main source of Big Rivers' financial woes, gave the co-op a
huge surplus of power after the co-op gambled and lost on its bet that a
multibillion-dollar synthetic fuels industry would sprout in its western
Kentucky service territory, thereby generating the need for more
electricity.
   Now, PacifiCorp is asked to be Big Rivers' savior. Under the winning
proposal submitted by the Portland, Ore., investor-owned utility, an as-yet
unnamed subsidiary of PacifiCorp would operate the three coal plants owned
by Big Rivers--480-MW Green, 455-MW Coleman and Wilson--in addition to the
315-MW Station Two plant owned by the city of Henderson but operated by Big
Rivers under a long-term contract.
   The subsidiary also would manage the plants' fuel supply and market
surplus power to other utilities in the eastern U.S.
   Handling coal purchases for Big Rivers would remove a stigma that has
surrounded the co-op since federal investigators uncovered a
bribery/kickback scheme several years ago. Three individuals have been
convicted so far on charges of bribing former Big Rivers general manager
William Thorpe, who was forced to resign in July 1992. Thorpe, who has
denied any wrongdoing, is expected to stand trial on a variety of criminal
charges next summer.
   Under the PacifiCorp arrangement, PacifiCorp would make long-term lease
and operating payments to Big Rivers, the amounts of which have not been
disclosed. The co-op would use that money to repay its debt.
   PacifiCorp would sell electricity to Big Rivers, which then would resell
it to its four distribution co-ops: Green River Electric Corp., Henderson
Union Electric Cooperative, Meade County Rural Electric Membership Corp.
and Jackson Purchase Rural Electric Membership Corp.
   Big Rivers and PacifiCorp officials say the result would be lower
electric rates for customers, although they would not estimate how much.
   Alcan Aluminum and Southwire Co., Big Rivers' two largest customers,
have been pressuring the co-op, both verbally and through numerous
lawsuits, for lower electric rates for years. In early January, they were
attempting to arrange a meeting with Big Rivers and PacifiCorp to make sure
their concerns are heard.
   ``We're looking for a business solution...we didn't do all this
litigation for nothing,'' said Allen Eyre, administrative manager at
Alcan's Sebree, Ky., smelter.

VIRGINIA POWER, DEVELOPER INK PACT KILLING 316-MW COAL-FIRED PROJECT

   Virginia Power has reached an agreement with Smith Cogeneration Inc. of
Oklahoma City calling for the developer to cancel a 316-MW, coal-fired
cogeneration plant at a Goodyear Tire & Rubber factory in Danville, Va.
   Terms of the agreement are confidential, said Gary Edwards, Virginia
Power's manager of capacity acquisition. Smith officials declined comment.
   Edwards confirmed the utility and the developer recently asked
Virginia's State Corporation Commission to drop their long-running dispute
over whether Virginia Power should be required to purchase power from
Smith.
   When it first proposed the $780-million project in the late 1980s, Smith
chose not to participate in Virginia Power's competitive solicitations for
non-utility generation (NUG) capacity. In 1991, the developer convinced the
SCC to appoint an arbitrator to help settle Smith's dispute with the
utility, which had refused to sign such a large contract outside the
solicitation process.
   A year ago, an SCC hearing examiner recommended the commission order
Virginia Power to settle the dispute, and suggested that an equitable
settlement might involve delaying the commercial start-up of the plant to
2000--four years later than Smith proposed.
   Meanwhile, Virginia Power continues to discuss with the owners of
operating NUGs on its system the possibility of somehow reducing the
utility's power-purchase costs and, in return, providing some financial
benefits to the owners.
   Among other things, said Edwards, some NUGs have expressed possible
interest in working with Virginia Power on ``creatively refinancing'' their
plants, or in turning over their fuel-supply obligations to the utility's
fossil and hydro generation business unit. No final agreements have been
reached to date.

FEDERAL JUDGE DENIES TEXAS CITY'S PETITION FOR TRANSMISSION ORDER

   A federal judge in Houston has denied a preliminary injunction sought by
College Station, Texas, in a transmission dispute with the neighboring city
of Bryan and the Texas Municipal Power Agency, a power pool that includes
Bryan and several other Texas cities.
   The dispute now shifts to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
where College Station has filed for a transmission order under Sec. 211 of
the Federal Power Act.
   College Station resorted to U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of Texas, Houston Division, after attempting to negotiate a
wheeling agreement with Bryan and the TMPA power pool it needed to enter
into a power-purchase agreement with Dallas-based TU Electric.
   College Station's existing power-purchase agreement with Bryan and TMPA
expired Jan. 1. Bryan and College Station are already in litigation over
service territory disputes.
   Since Bryan and the power pool had been unsuccessful bidders in response
to the request for proposals that College Station awarded to TU Electric in
September, the city charged Bryan and the power pool with wrongful
interference and sought relief from the court under federal antitrust law.
   But U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Atlas denied the ``extraordinary
relief'' sought by College Station, finding that Bryan and the TMPA were
simply ``hard bargaining'' in their own best interests.
   Atlas questioned ``the legal viability of the claimed irreparable harm
and whether the public interest is served by a federal court granting
injunctive relief in what is essentially an aborted contract negotiation
between public entities engaging in state-authorized commercial
activities.''
   Lawyers for College Station conceded they may have lost the battle in
Atlas's courtroom, but asserted they won the war as the judge during a
hearing last month extracted concessions from Bryan and the power pool
ensuring that TU Electric's power would arrive with the new year.
   The judge persuaded the defendants to sign a remote control area load
agreement with TU Electric, allowing the utility to incorporate College
Station into its load remotely through telemetering equipment. Prior to the
hearing, the city manager of Bryan, who chairs the power pool, had declined
to sign the agreement, according to attorneys for College Station.
   The judge also extracted promises that Bryan and the power pool would
not interfere with College Station's receipt of the power while the rates
and terms of a wheeling agreement were in dispute. In a footnote to her
order, Atlas appeared to suggest she would hold Bryan and the power pool in
contempt if they did not live up to their word.
   Atlas rejected College Station's antitrust claims, finding that the
state action doctrine provided Bryan and the power pool with immunity from
claims under the Sherman Act.
   While College Station complained that Bryan and the TMPA proposed
transmission rates intended to make the power-sales agreement with TU
Electric uneconomic, the judge accepted the defendants' arguments that
existing law provides the grounds for embedded-cost rates and ``pancaking''
of rates across the TMPA system.
   ``The court cannot find a basis to conclude that defendants have acted
beyond their rights as owners of transmission facilities,'' Atlas ruled.
   The judge also rejected the tortious, or wrongful, interference
complaint, citing a lack of evidence that the defendants were blocking
College Station's receipt of the TU Electric power. ``Aggressive
negotiation, without more, does not amount to tortious interference with
contract,'' Atlas said.
   ``The court expressly declines to find that any party has acted in bad
faith,'' the court ruled. ``Both sides in these negotiations have been
jockeying for position and seeking leverage that will enable them to attain
a transmission agreement that best served their constituents' interests.
This is understandable under the circumstances and does not warrant court
intervention.''
   With the judge's decision, the focus of the transmission dispute now
shifts to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, where College Station
is seeking a wheeling order under Section 211 of the Federal Power Act.
   In the filing at FERC, College Station said Bryan and the municipal
power pool ``are exploiting their dominant position in the transmission
services market to deny College Station access to essential facilities to
purchase cheaper power from TU Electric.''
   Before the RFP was awarded to TU Electric, the rate for transmission
services offered by Bryan and the power pool amounted to about $17/kW/year,
according to College Station's filing at FERC. After the power-sales
agreement was awarded to TU Electric, the rates for transmission service
offered by Bryan and the power pool ultimately added up to $45.35/kW/year,
the city complained.
   The four cities have a tariff on file with the Texas Public Utility
Commission providing for a rate of $10.64/kW/year, College Station told
FERC.
   ``Having lost out in the marketplace to a more efficient competitor,
Bryan [and the municipal power pool] are intentionally interfering with
College Station's purchase of the transmission services necessary...at fair
and reasonable rates and on reasonable terms and conditions,'' the city
complained at FERC.
   The transmission agreement offered by Bryan and the power pool not only
called for rates making the TU Electric agreement more costly than Bryan's
proposal for services, but contained a clause forestalling College Station
from seeking relief at FERC or the Texas PUC, the city said in its FERC
filing.
   In the course of last month's hearing before Judge Atlas, the defendants
agreed to drop that demand, the order noted.
   The Texas PUC may decide to intervene at FERC and could ask the federal
regulators to defer the matter to Texas for resolution, according to one
source involved in the dispute. The deadline for interventions at FERC is
Jan. 22.

AEP DISCOUNTS TRANSMISSION AND SEES REVENUES INCREASE FIVEFOLD: FALCONE

   A more open transmission system and discounted transmission rates have
produced a fivefold increase in revenues for American Electric Power,
according to Charles Falcone, senior vice president for system power
markets.
   Already for 1996, AEP has booked five to six times more point-to-point
service than AEP provided during 1995, Falcone told Electric Utility Week.
He said the discounting policy has boosted AEP's revenues from third-party
transmission fees to $20-million for 1996.
   The results have ``turned my eye to a different approach,'' Falcone
said: ``There'll be a lot more third-party transactions across the AEP
system this year.''
   Another strategy AEP will employ this year involves contracts for
``conversion service,'' Falcone said. The utility will broker deals
allowing wholesale power purchasers the option to ship coal to AEP and
receive electricity in return. This approach will attract customers when
AEP's prevailing price is not competitive, he said.

NORTHWEST UTILITIES DROP PLANS TO PURCHASE AS MUCH AS 1,000 MW

   Energy consultants Power Resource Managers of Bellevue, Wash., said the
four utilities it represents have postponed plans to purchase up to 1,000
MW because of plummeting power prices and surplus West Coast generation
(EUW, 20 Feb '95, 13).
   The utilities PRM represented--the public utility districts of Benton,
Franklin and Grays Harbor counties in Washington and the Oregon-based
Clatskanie People's Utility District--wanted to diversify their supplies
away from the Bonneville Power Administration.
   But this fall, after BPA dropped its proposed rates to utility customers
8.2% to 2.49 cents/kWh, PRM asked the bidders to re-examine their numbers.
PRM now has placed the bidding on hold.
   Spot market power has been available for as low as 3 mills/kWh this
fall. ``I have not seen power prices this low since the 1970s,'' said
Gerald Garman, PRM president. He estimates the downward spiral on power
prices will continue for another 18 months. ``If you factor in inflation,
this would place power prices at well under 1 mill/kWh in 1970 terms, the
cheapest in Northwest history.''
   The Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa) of Wenatchee, Wash., and the Pacific
Northwest Generating Cooperative, based in Portland, Ore., had been PRM
members but dropped out to pursue their own power-purchase options.
   PRM had shortlisted three independent plants and three utility system
sales totaling 1,295 MW earlier this year.
   Shortlisted utilities were PacifiCorp with a 20-year, 200-MW, baseload
system sale and a 20-year, 100-MW intermediate load system sale, and the
Bonneville Power Administration and Washington Water Power, each proposing
10-year, 100-MW system sales.
   Shortlisted independents were U.S. Generating Co., with a site for a
350-MW plant in either Arlington or Bucoda, Wash.; Summit Energy Group with
a 250-MW plant to be located in Goldendale, Wash.; and the Washington
Public Power Supply System of Richland, Wash., which proposed a 245-MW
gas-fired plant at Satsop, Wash.

TVA IN DEAL WITH ENRON TO BUY POWER ON AN OPTION BASIS; ISSUES FINAL IRP

   The Tennessee Valley Authority has signed a contract with Enron Capital
and Trade Resources to purchase power on an option basis during the period
1998-2002.
   Neither TVA nor Enron would provide further details about the contract,
citing confidentiality requirements.
   The options contract is the first TVA has concluded based on bids from
an August 1994 request for proposals for up to 4,000 MW of load, and TVA
officials said they expect to sign other options contracts in early 1996.
   The contract was announced at the same time TVA issued a final version
of its integrated resource plan that said the federally owned utility
planned to use options contracts to purchase up to 3,000 MW of peaking and
baseload power between 1998 and 2002.
   Under the TVA option system, TVA will pay an up-front option price and
then decide by a predetermined strike date whether to buy the power. It
will pay the actual cost of the energy on delivery.
   TVA had said in early 1995 that it had received 138 option bids covering
9,800 MW of peaking and 12,200 MW of baseload power, but it gave little
further information.
   Also in the final version of its IRP, TVA said it was proceeding with
planning for a 400-MW coal gasification demonstration plant at its
Bellefonte nuclear site in northern Alabama. The project would use Dept. of
Energy clean coal research funding transferred from a stalled project in
Springfield, Ill. and use generation equipment already installed for the
never-completed nuclear plant.
   TVA is carrying out an 18-month study of long-term uses for the
Bellefonte site and based on that would be ready to begin construction of
the demonstration plant in late 1997, with an on-line target of 2000.
   If the initial plant is successful, it would become the core of a larger
plant that would produce 484 MW and co-produce methanol.
   In response to comments on its IRP from environmental and conservation
groups, the utility also said it intended to beef up its energy
conservation efforts to produce 650 MW of new savings by 2002 and 2,200 MW
by 2010. This represents an increased savings of 750 MW over previous
plans.
   TVA also said it would accelerate pilot renewables projects, including a
wind turbine and landfill-methane fuel cells. It also will begin a
commercial program in 1997 to co-fire wood waste from the region at its
large coal-fired power plants.
   TVA will review final comments on the IRP during January, and the TVA
board is expected to approve the final plan in mid-February, ending a
planning process that was ordered by Congress in the 1992 Energy Policy
Act.

FUELED BY PUBLIC OUTCRY, CITY OF TOLEDO TO RESUME STUDY ON FORMING
MUNICIPAL

   More than a year after a lack of funding forced its suspension, a study
about whether to create a municipal electric system in Toledo is set to
resume, fueled by a public outcry.
   By late this month or early February, SVBK Consulting Group of Denver,
Colo., will attempt to pick up where it left off when the Toledo City
Council decided not to appropriate additional money to finish the second
phase of the study. The first part, completed in May 1992, concluded that a
muni in certain sections of Toledo could effectively compete with Toledo
Edison, the city's longtime electricity supplier (EUW, 1 June '92, 6).
   Toledo residents, already saddled with Toledo Ed electric rates that are
among the highest in the Midwest, were encouraged further by the utility's
pending request for a $35.2-million, or 4.17%, rate hike. They gathered
60,000 signatures on petitions supporting the resumption of the
municipalization study and presented them to the city council.
   That prompted the council to allocate $250,000 to complete the study,
hopefully by next fall.
   ``The citizens were particularly unhappy that the council stopped the
study in the middle, and they went door to door and got signatures,'' Kerry
Bruce, attorney for the Toledo Dept. of Public Utilities, told Electric
Utility Week. ``With that kind of interest, [the city council] simply
acceded to the requests of the citizens and funded the second half of the
study.''
   A Toledo Ed spokeswoman insisted her company ``doesn't have any
problems'' with resuming the study. But she did express some skepticism
about the fairness of the inquiry.
   If the study is fair, it will point out several risks inherent in
forming a municipal utility, she said. However, ``it's been our past
experience that the team of consultants Toledo is working with is not
fair...if this holds true, this group will say that municipalization is
feasible.''
   A ``fair, thorough, objective study will show what we already know--now
is not a good time to get into the electric utility business,'' she added.
``There are so many changes going on...deregulation is coming and people
are looking at retail wheeling. If that is the case, a new fledgling
municipal system would be competing for customers not only with the
existing investor-owned utility, but independent power producers and other
utilities as well.''
   Bruce said he was not surprised that Toledo Ed apparently feels
threatened by the study. The Centerior Energy subsidiary, he noted, ``has
some of the highest rates in the region.'' Those rates would go even higher
if the state Public Utilities Commission approves the proposed rate
increase later this year.
   The 1992 study found that a suggested buyout of Toledo Ed's system
within the city would be too expensive, costing about $473-million. But
construction of a parallel transmission and distribution system in parts of
Toledo, similar to the Cleveland Public Power system, could be economically
feasible.
   Bruce agreed that ``things are too volatile'' in the utility industry to
justify spending ``$100-million to build a competing, full-blown utility''
to do battle with Toledo Ed. He wants the consultant to shift the focus of
the renewed study away from its earlier emphasis.
   Instead, Bruce wants SVBK to ``look for ways the city can aggregate its
load and provide a conduit for retail wheeling to customers. I think it's
worth exploring to see if there's anything we can do short of constructing
a complete, full-blown system.''
   The Toledo Ed spokeswoman acknowledged her company needs to make some
improvements, including being ``more open and a more reliable supplier of
electricity.'' But if Toledo decides to form a muni, ``we would be a strong
competitor and fight for every customer.''

EL PASO ELECTRIC RETAINS 125-MW AIR BASE LOAD, ENDING LONG DISPUTE

   El Paso Electric has signed a new power-sales contract with Holloman Air
Force Base in New Mexico, ending a lengthy legal dispute over the base's
right to purchase power from alternative sources.
   Under the agreement, announced Dec. 29, the base will buy approximately
125 MW of load from EPE at current rates and in return EPE will agree to
freeze rates for 10 years.
   Holloman has been a long-term customer of EPE but in 1993, after EPE
filed for bankruptcy, the Air Force announced it would not renew its
contract with EPE when it expired in February 1994. Instead, in June 1993
Holloman issued a request for proposals for alternative supplies for the
base.
   However, in January 1994 EPE sued the Air Force, claiming that it did
not have the right to buy outside supplies under federal procurement rules
and also that EPE was the only utility authorized under New Mexico law to
provide retail service to the base.
   Because of the suit, the Air Force never went through with awarding a
new contract and EPE has continued to supply the base on an ad hoc basis.
Under the terms of the new agreement, the Air Force RFP has been canceled
and the EPE suit has been withdrawn.
   Also as part of the deal, at the end of the 10-year period Holloman will
be under no obligation to take service from EPE and can terminate the
contract without payment of damages.
   EPE is also trying to resolve a similar problem with the U.S. Army's
White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico which had issued a request for
proposals for about 75 MW in late 1994 to replace EPE supplies.
   In that case, EPE filed a protest with the Army which then decided to
suspend the RFP and review the legal issues. EPE has said that if the Army
decides to go ahead with the RFP it will file a new suit to block the
purchases.
   The actions come at a time when Congress is looking at legislation that
could free military bases to buy their own power, undercutting EPE's legal
claims (see story this issue).
   The Holloman deal with EPE parallels a rate freeze plan agreed to
between EPE and the city of El Paso last August which broke an impasse and
opened the way for EPE to end its bankruptcy case.
   EPE now hopes to win confirmation of its reorganization plan by the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Austin on Jan. 9 and emerge from bankruptcy shortly
afterwards.

CLINTON VETOES DEFENSE BILL, KILLING STUDY OF SAVINGS FROM POWER-SHOPPING

   Industrials, marketers, independent power producers and a few utilities
that want Congress to let Dept. of Defense facilities shop for electricity
lost a major round when President Clinton vetoed the bill containing a
mandate for DOD to study the shopping issue and report by March 1 (EUW, 25
Dec '95, 2).
   The House version of the DOD bill had lifted a congressional ban on
defense facilities shopping for power, but in a compromise with the Senate,
the final version of the bill (H.R. 1530) called only for the study, which
was to be done in consultation with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
   Advocates said they were pleased with the study requirement because it
gave them a chance to use the study to support legislation later this year.
Now they will have to try another route. One industry source said he hopes
DOD will go ahead and perform a study even without the mandate.
   The study was also to examine the stranded-investment liability for
utilities if DOD bypassed them for less expensive power, and to identify
statutory and regulatory impediments to such shopping.
   Clinton vetoed the measure because of major controversies unrelated to
the power provisions. Congress could revise the measure and try to send it
back to the White House.

PSC CAPS TAMPA ELECTRIC ALLOWED EQUITY RETURN AT 12.5% FOR 1996

   The Florida Public Service Commission voted Jan. 3 to cap the 1996 rate
of return on equity for Tampa Electric at 12.5%, and to allow the PSC to
determine how any overearnings would be distributed.
   The move comes in the wake of TECO earning $45-million more than its
allowed equity return in 1995 and will forestall a rate case that would
have been filed in 1996 to pay for a new generating unit.
   In an earlier stipulation with staff (Docket No. 950379-EI), TECO's 1995
earnings were capped at 12.75%. The $45-million of 1995 overearnings will
be deferred until 1997, after TECO's new $550-million, 260-MW integrated
coal gasification combined cycle plant in Polk County goes on line in late
1996. TECO's actual ROE for 1995 was expected to be about 16%.
   The deal between the PSC staff and TECO effectively replaced
negotiations the utility was conducting with the Office of the Public
Counsel, which represents ratepayers at the Florida Public Service
Commission, according to OPC attorney Roger Howe.
   The PSC's action, which was the result of last-minute negotiations
between staff and TECO on 1996 earnings, could mean any excess revenues
could be used for the plant, a refund, to offset regulatory assets, or for
depreciation in 1997 or later. The PSC will likely make a decision on
disposition of 1996 excesses sometime in early 1997, according to Tim
Devlin of the PSC's Auditing and Finance Division.
   Under the arrangement for 1996, TECO will have an ROE range of 11.5% to
13.5%. However, all of the earnings over 11.5% will be split, which
effectively caps earnings at 12.5%. TECO estimated it will earn about
13.27% in 1996.
   The Polk unit will go into ratebase in late 1996 and based on TECO's
earnings projections, which are considered conservative, it will still earn
in excess of its allowed ROE. The 1995 excess carried forward was also
expected to cover the additional cost of the new unit through 1997, and
possibly beyond.
   Howe said that because interest rates were expected to further decline
during the next few years, it was likely the PSC would reduce TECO's
allowed ROE for 1997, which could mean additional excess earnings in that
year, despite the new unit.

S.C. CONSUMER AGENCY OPPOSING APPROVAL OF SCE&G DEPRECIATION RESERVE
TRANSFER

   South Carolina's Dept. of Consumer Affairs said the state's Public
Service Commission made ``a serious mistake'' in late December when it
approved--as part of a general rate increase for South Carolina Electric &
Gas--an SCE&G proposal to shift nearly $257-million in depreciation
reserves from the utility's transmission and distribution assets to its
nuclear generation assets.
   The state consumer agency said that if the approved transfer holds up to
regulatory and legal challenges DCA expects to mount, it would give SCE&G
an unfair competitive advantage over other electricity generators, and
would improperly shift costs from large industrial customers to small
commercial and residential classes.
   In its Dec. 27, 1995, ruling (Docket No. 95-1000-E), the PSC granted
SCE&G a 7.34%, $67.5-million general rate increase to be implemented in two
phases. The first phase is a $59.5-million hike as soon as its new 385-MW
baseload plant in Cope, S.C., begins commercial operation later this month,
and the second is an $8-million increase next Jan. 1.
   The utility had requested a two-step increase totaling $76.7-million,
primarily to recoup the $436-million cost of the Cope plant, which is
expected to be the utility's last baseload addition until 2012 (EUW, 24
July '94, 19).
   The commission also said it will allow SCE&G to earn a 12% rate of
return on common equity, which is lower than the 12.25% rate the utility
had requested but higher than both the 11% it had been permitted to earn
and the 11.25% proposed by DCA.
   Nancy Vaughn Coombs, DCA's deputy consumer advocate, took issue with
virtually all the PSC's decisions in the ruling, asserting that the rate
increase is more than three times larger than it should be, and that the
commission failed to pass through to ratepayers some $12.3-million in
savings SCE&G has achieved through restructuring and downsizing.
   She also criticized the PSC's approval of SCE&G's proposed ``storm
damage reserve account,'' under which the utility will collect more than
$4-million a year through rates over the next 10 years to create a
$50-million fund to be used to offset the cost of repairing damage to
SCE&G's uninsured transmission and distribution facilities.
   Coombs said an actuarial expert told the PSC during hearings on the
proposed rate hike that, on average, SCE&G's T&D system is likely to
sustain only $2-million a year in uninsured damage. She added that, in her
view, electric customers in the 1990s should not pay for a fund that may
not be used for another 20 or 30 years.
   But the DCA official said her agency is most concerned about the
depreciation reserve transfer, which she said would result in a lower
``book value'' for SCE&G's two-thirds stake in the 900-MW V.C. Summer
nuclear plant and a higher book value for the utility's T&D assets.
   That would have the effect of shifting SCE&G's costs away from its
generation sector, which is likely to face increasing competition as
electric industry deregulation takes hold, to its transmission and
distribution sector, which is likely to remain a monopoly, Coombs said.
   As a result, SCE&G will have ``a significantly increased probability''
of recouping--through T&D rates--nuclear investment costs that ``otherwise
would have been subjected to an uncertain policy regarding the recovery of
costs of uneconomic generation capacity.''
   Coombs said the DCA will ask the PSC to reconsider its ruling and added
that if the commission fails to do so, her agency is likely to file a legal
challenge in state court, asserting the depreciation reserve transfer
violates South Carolina law by shifting costs from one customer class to
another.
   Belton Ziegler, SCE&G's general counsel, dismissed Coombs' claims and
asserted that the PSC ruling ``will help us prepare for competition.''
Among other things, Ziegler said the depreciation reserve transfer is a
necessary preemptive step to ensure that any large retail customers that
leave the utility for other suppliers help pay for assets SCE&G had
developed to serve them.
   Without the shift, the SCE&G attorney said, residential and small
commercial customers would likely end up paying for ``100%'' of the
utility's stranded investment, ``and we don't think that would be fair.''
   Regarding the storm fund, Ziegler said that after Hurricane Hugo
battered SCE&G's service territory in September 1989, the utility looked
into ways it could prepare for the next big storm. ``It became clear that
commercial insurance would be prohibitively expensive, and that it would
make more sense to set up a fund'' like the one the utility proposed and
the PSC just approved.

SOCAL ED AFFILIATE CLOSES $1-BILLION PURCHASE OF 2,088-MW U.K. GENERATOR

   Southern California Edison affiliate Mission Energy has reached
financial closing on its $1-billion purchase of First Hydro Co., the
company controlling two pumped-storage hydro facilities in Wales totaling
2,088 MW, from the U.K.'s National Grid Co.
   Mission beat two other finalists for First Hydro, Scottish
Hydro-Electric and Virginia Power affiliate Dominion Energy Inc. (EUW, 27
Nov '95, 15).
   First Hydro will operate as an independent generating company selling
power into the U.K. power pool on a competitive basis.
   Mission, which closed on First Hydro Dec. 22, noted the acquisition is
being financed with about $400-million of equity and $600-million of
non-recourse debt underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd Limited (BZW). A
significant portion of the debt will consist of long-term bonds, Mission
said. BZW also served as Mission's financial advisor.
   The two pumped-storage stations in North Wales are at Dinorwig and
Ffestiniog. The Dinorwig plant, commissioned in 1983, consists of six units
totaling 1,728 MW. The Ffestiniog station, in service since 1963, is made
up of four units totaling 360 MW.
   The Dinorwig and Ffestiniog facilities function as peaking units and
provide rapid generation response to sudden changes in electricity
demands.
   Edward Muller, Mission Energy president and chief executive officer,
said ``First Hydro represents a permanent investment in some of the most
strategically important generating plants in the electricity system of the
United Kingdom.''
   Acquisition of First Hydro means Mission is a key U.K. power generator,
with total generating capacity of 2,522 MW, including 80% of a 220-MW
gas-fired plant in Roosecote, Cumbria, and 33% of a 214-MW gas-fired,
cogeneration plant at Derwent.
   It also apparently catapults Mission Energy, an affiliate of Southern
California Edison, back to its earlier position as the world's largest
independent power producer, with 5,551 MW of financed net equity.
   In July 1995, the U.K.'s National Power held the top spot with 4,465 MW,
followed by Consolidated Electric Power Asia of Hong Kong with 4,391 MW,
PowerGen of the U.K. with 3,955 MW, and Mission Energy, 3,463 MW, according
to The McGraw-Hill Companies' 155 Independent Power Companies--Profiles of
Industry Players and Projects (EUW, 31 July '95, 15).

3,500-MW BRAZILIAN UTILITY SPLIT IN TWO IN PREPARATION FOR AUCTION

   Brazil's Servicos de Eletricidade SA (Light), the 3,500-MW utility
serving Rio de Janeiro, will be split into two companies to facilitate its
sale early this year, under a law approved by Brazil's congress.
   A new company, LightRio, will continue to generate and distribute
electricity to Rio de Janeiro and will be offered at auction to private
investors. The other company, LightPar, will hold Light's 47.5% stake in
Sao Paulo Electric Co. (Eletropaulo), one of the utilities serving Sao
Paulo.
   Light was scheduled to be privatized in an auction by year-end 1995, but
will now likely be auctioned ``in the first few months'' of 1996.
   The privatization of Light has been under discussion and planning for
many years, but Light's stake in Eletropaulo and the fact that Eletropaulo
owes Light about $1.24-billion had been a barrier to the sale (EUW, 15 May,
16).
   The issue came to a head over whether or not previously passed
legislation was sufficient for the division of Light. In the end, it was
decided the more prudent course would be to pass a separate law to cover
the splitting of Light, said Bernardo Braune, assistant to the director of
privatization at Banco Nacional do Desencolvimento Economico de Social
(BNDS, National Bank for Economic & Social Development).
   The resulting law, No. 9163, was ratified on Dec. 15 and allows for the
creation of subsidiaries from Brazil's main electric utility, Centrais
Eletricas Brazileiras SA (Eletrobras).
   According to government estimates, LightRio has a book value of about
$3-billion and annual revenues of about $1.4-billion. LightPar has a
nominal value of $3.6-billion, according to the government. Only about
$545-million of Light's total $1.24-billion Eletropaulo debt will be
transferred to LightRio.
   The sale of LightRio is part of a much larger privatization process
underway in Brazil. The first electric utility sold in this program was
Escelsa, which was won at auction by Brazil's Iven Group in July.
   As part of this program, Eletrobras' four main utilities--Eletronorte,
Eletrosul, Chesf, and Furnas--will also be privatized. But the size and
cross ownership between Eletrobras and its subsidiaries complicates
privatization.
   The next step in the privatization of Eletrobras will be a solicitation
for consultants to advise the government on how best to privatize the
45,500-MW utility. The Ministry of Mines & Energy will in the first half of
1996 issue a request for proposals for the consulting contract.
   The consultants will advise the ministry on the model for privatization,
the creation of an independent regulatory agency, interconnecting the
transmission grid, setting tariffs and other issues.
   In a separate solicitation process, BNDS will issue an RFP for a
consultant to advise on the actual ``objects of sale,'' said BNDS' Braune.
The consultant will help determine, for instance, whether Eletrobras
subsidiaries should be sold entirely or if generating plants should be sold
individually or in packages of more than one generating plant.
   The BNDS solicitation will be run concurrently with the ministry's
solicitation for consultants.
   The recommendations of the consultants will be forwarded to a specially
created Council of National Privatization, which will decide on the final
structure of the privatization process. The council will be formed from the
Ministry of State Planning--which will serve as the president of the
council--the Ministry of the Civil House, the Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of Administration, and the Ministry of Tourism, Industry & Trade.
   Meanwhile, Brazil is moving forward with its planned solicitations for
private sector companies to invest in the completion of stalled
hydroelectric projects.
   The first projects being put out to bid are in Sao Paulo and include
Canoas, a two-unit, 154-MW hydro plant. The Canaos solicitation will be
followed by solicitation for Porto Primavera, an 1,800-MW hydro plant.

NSP UNIT, TRANSFIELD SIGN 180-MW POWER-SALES PACT IN AUSTRALIA

   Northern States Power unit NRG Energy Inc. and Transfield Technologies
Pty Ltd. of Sydney, Australia, have signed a power-purchase agreement with
the Queensland Transmission & Supply Corp. for supplies from the 180-MW
Collinsville coal-fired steam turbine station, which will be
recommissioned.
   The plant was decommissioned in 1989 and will again supply power to the
grid in early 1998. An interim agreement for the sale of the Collinsville
plant was signed in March as part of the government's Energy Policy
Statement (EUW, 27 March, 16).
   The plant is being refurbished in a joint venture between NRG Australia
Pty Ltd., a Brisbane-based subsidiary of NRG Energy that will operate the
station, and Transfield, which will construct and maintain the plant.
   Robert McClenachan, NRG's vice president of international business
development, said the project ``furthers NRG's objective to actively seek
and secure independent power projects throughout Australia, New Zealand and
Southeast Asia.'' NRG Australia also has a 37% stake in the 1,680-MW
Gladstone Power Station, which it operates in Queensland (EUW, 11 April
'94, 17).

CSW FORMS VENTURE WITH MEXICAN INDUSTRIAL FOR 100-MW PROJECT

   Central & South West unit CSW International has formed a joint venture
with Monterrey, Mexico-based petrochemical group Alpek to build, own and
operate a 100-MW cogeneration project at Alpek's Altamira petrochemical
complex.
   The project, which will function primarily as an industrial power plant,
will supply electricity and thermal heat to two existing Alpek units
operating at Altamira--Petrocel and Indelpro--and a new Temex plant now
under construction.
   All of the cogeneration project's production will be used by the
industrial facilities, although some excess capacity may be available to
other industrials in the area.
   Petrocel and Temex will serve as the facility's steam hosts, CSW
International said.
   CSW International and Alpek each hold a 50% equity stake in the project.
Construction is scheduled to begin in March 1996, with commercial operation
set for fourth-quarter 1997.
   Alpek is significantly expanding petrochemical production at its
Altamira complex, with most of the expansion in operation by the fourth
quarter of 1997.
   Efforts to finance the project will be made in 1996, after solid
equipment and construction costs are available.
   ``CSW has long and cordial working relationships with business and
governmental entities in Mexico,'' said Terry Dennis, CSW International
president and CEO, in a statement. CSW officials said similar industrial
energy projects are being sought in Mexico, although no additional project
announcements are expected soon.
   Recently, Central & South West successfully bid $2.52-billion to acquire
Seeboard PLC, a U.K. regional electric company, in a friendly takeover
arrangement (EUW, 13 Nov, 1).
   Alpek is a major petrochemical manufacturing group in Mexico, with
annual revenues of $1.3-billion.

ENRON SECURES RIGHTS TO BUY 5,400-MW OUTPUT FROM OGLETHORPE POWER SYSTEM

   In a precedent-setting marketing deal, Enron Power Marketing will have
rights from January to April 1996 to buy the total energy output from the
5,400-MW Oglethorpe Power system and at the same time will meet the energy
requirements of Oglethorpe's 39 member cooperatives between January and
April.
   The deal, which was announced Dec. 22, 1995, and was being finalized
over the New Year's break, is a major coup for Enron, which will double the
current energy volumes it markets and could get a leg up on future
longer-term deals with Oglethorpe and its members.
   Oglethorpe already announced in early December that it had decided to
carry out a major restructuring that would split the company up into
separate generation, transmission and system operating companies and give
the 39 members more freedom to buy and sell power supplies on the wholesale
market (EUW, 11 Dec '95, 1).
   Under the deal with Enron, the 39 members will be able to cover their
energy needs at a lower price than before and at the same time will be able
to sell excess energy allotments from Oglethorpe through Enron, saving more
money.
   Enron will have access to Oglethorpe's system energy to both supply the
members and sell excess amounts on the regional markets. Enron was selected
by Oglethorpe for the deal from among eight bidders who responded to a
request for proposals in early December. The deal only covers energy and
does not affect the members' commitments to buy capacity directly from
Oglethorpe under existing contracts.
   The four-month arrangement with Enron will cover the rest of the winter
heating season and provide a convenient way for Oglethorpe members to
benefit from marketing opportunities while they work out the restructuring
plan with Oglethorpe.
   While other marketers have had similar arrangements with small utilities
elsewhere, the Enron-Oglethorpe deal appears to be the first time that a
marketer has provided full energy trading services for such a large
utility.
   Once Oglethorpe completes its restructuring in the coming months, a
group of six member co-ops called Cooperative Power Inc. is expected to
contract on their own for a marketer to manage their energy procurement and
trading. CPI already has issued a request for proposals for such services
and is expected to choose a winning bidder soon.
   Other Oglethorpe members appear likely to set up similar trading groups,
and Oglethorpe itself has said it plans to offer a regional pooling
arrangement for its system energy that will be managed by a separate
Oglethorpe operating company.
   Separately, the Oglethorpe restructuring plan got an initial boost from
Rural Utilities Service administrator Wally Beyer, who endorsed the general
concept in a Dec. 12, 1995, letter to the Oglethorpe board.
   Beyer called the restructuring plan a ``forward looking solution'' that
would keep the group intact and still address the growing diversity among
its members. He instructed his staff to move as quickly as possible to
review the plan and make final decisions on it.
