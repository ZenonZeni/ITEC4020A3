This chapter describes how to install your server and covers the
following topics:

<H2><A NAME="HDRINSTA" HREF="#PToC_35">Before you begin</A></H2>
<P>
Before beginning the installation procedure,
you need to choose the installation medium and
the type of installation.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_36" HREF="#PToC_36">Choose the installation medium</A></H3>
<P>
Choose one of the following methods for installing your server:
<DL>
<P><DT>
CD-ROM
<DD>
Remove the CD-ROM from the server box and
go to <A HREF="#HDRISITFRS">"Choose the type of installation to perform"</A>.
<P><DT>
Remote code server
<DD>
To install from a remote code server, you must
first copy the
server product files from the
CD-ROM onto the remote code server.
Also, your system must have a LAN connection to the remote code server,
and you must have access to the directory where the server files are
located.
<P>
Because the server complies with IBM&#39;s Configuration,
Installation, and Distribution (CID) architecture,
you can automate installation by using a CID response file.
The response file contains pre-set values for the installation
variables you are prompted for during a regular installation.
If you <B><I>are</I></B> using a response file, go to
<A HREF="#HDRAUTOINS">"Automating installation"</A>.
<P>
If you <B><I>are not</I></B> using a response file to automate
installation, go to <A HREF="#HDRISITFRS">"Choose the type of installation to perform"</A>.
</DL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="HDRISITFRS" HREF="#PToC_37">Choose the type of installation to perform</A></H3>
<P>
Choose which type of installation you want to perform:
<DL>
<P><DT>
First time installation
<DD>
If this is the first time you have installed the server
on your machine, follow the steps under <A HREF="#HDRFIRSTI">"Installing for the first time"</A>.
<P><DT>
Migration
<DD>
If you already have a release of the server on your machine, you
can migrate to the current release of the server.
Migrating allows you to save your current configuration settings.
Follow the instructions under <A HREF="#HDRMIGOS2">"Migrating from a pre-V4R2 level server"</A>.
For planning information, go to <A HREF="icsur005.html#HDRMIGISS">"Migration considerations"</A>.
<P><DT>
Reinstallation of the server
<DD>
If you want to reinstall the server, follow the instructions
under <A HREF="#HDRMIGRAT">"Reinstalling the server"</A>.

</UL>
<P><LI><B>Start the installation</B>.
<P>Click <B>Install</B>.
<P><LI><B>Select optional default values</B>.
<P>
From the server Install Configuration window,

The default value is the host name defined in your CONFIG.SYS file.
If you want to use an alias, you can change this field to a
fully qualified host name that is defined in your domain name server.
<P><LI><B>HTTP Port</B>
<P>
The default value of 80 is the well known port number for
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
Other port numbers less
than 1024 are reserved for other TCP/IP applications.
Port
numbers 8080 and 8008 are commonly used for testing servers.
<P><LI><B>SSL Port</B>
<P>
This is

It is strongly recommended that you change the default during
installation.
<P><LI><B>Password</B>
<P>This is
the password you use
to protect access to the
Configuration and Administration forms.  Anyone attempting to use the
Internet Connection Secure Server Configuration and Administration forms
will be prompted to enter this password.
The default value is <TT>webibm</TT>.
It is strongly recommended that you change the default during
installation.
</UL>
<P><LI><B>Select automatic server startup</B>.
<P>
Use the <B>Auto Start Server at Bootup</B> check box

All of your current configuration settings are saved

the Configuration and Administration forms.
In the configuration file, this protection setup
has a name of PROT-ADMIN.
Your current PROT-ADMIN protection is overwritten

You can either use the default or
change it again after reinstalling the server.

By default, the ADMIN.PWD password file on the
path specified on the SET ETC statement in your CONFIG.SYS file
controls access to the Configuration and Administration forms.

<H2><A NAME="HDRAUTOINS" HREF="#PToC_43">Automating installation</A></H2>
If you are installing the server from a remote code server,
you can use a Configuration, Installation, and Distribution
(CID) response file to automatically install or update the server.
This section describes how to perform the following two types of
automated installation:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Remote attended installation
<LI>Remote unattended installation
</UL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_44" HREF="#PToC_44">Remote attended installation</A></H3>
<P>
If a remote code server has the server product files, the clients
of the code server can perform a remote attended installation.
Clients must meet the server hardware and software requirements,
have a LAN connection, and have access to the remote code server
directory that contains the server product files.
For more information on hardware and software requirements,
see <A HREF="icsur005.html#HDRPLN">Chapter 3. "Planning for installation"</A>.
<P>
The code server must have a server response file.
The response file contains pre-set values for the installation
variables.
The default response file for the server is named websrvr.rsp.
The default response file contains comments that explain the
different variables and how to set them.
<P>
From the client where you want to install the server,
follow these instructions for a remote attended installation:
<OL>
<P><LI>Verify that you have access to the remote code server and that
the server response file is in the same directory of the code server
as the product files.
<P><LI>At an OS/2 prompt, enter
<PRE>
   <VAR>z&#58;\path\</VAR><B>install /r&#58;</B><VAR>z&#58;\path\websrvr.rsp</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>where:
<UL>
<P><LI><B><VAR>z&#58;\path\</VAR></B> is the drive and path
where the server files reside on the code server.
<P><LI><B>/r&#58;</B>
indicates that the name of a response file follows.
<UL>
<P><LI><VAR>z&#58;\path\websrvr.rsp</VAR>
is the name of the response file to be used.
You must give the full drive and path name
if it is different from the current directory.
</UL>
</UL>
<P><B>Note: </B>There are no spaces in the
<B>/r&#58;<VAR>z&#58;\path\</VAR>websrvr.rsp</B> string.
<P><LI>As the installation process continues,
either use the pre-set values from the response file
or modify them to meet your own particular needs.
</OL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="Header_45" HREF="#PToC_45">Remote unattended installation</A></H3>
<P>
<P>
You can use a software distribution manager to
perform remote unattended installations of the server.
Remote unattended installation allows you to distribute software
from a software distribution manager to workstations.
You must have a network connection established between the
software distribution manager and the target workstations.
The target workstations must have the client software for the
software distribution manager installed.
<P>
For remote unattended installation of the server using other
software distribution managers, use the install command as follows:
<P>&nbsp;
<PRE>
   <B>install  /x  /r&#58;</B><VAR>z&#58;\path\websrvr.rsp</VAR>  <B>/l1&#58;</B><VAR>z&#58;\path\error.log</VAR>  <B>/l2&#58;</B><VAR>z&#58;\path\history.log</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>where:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>/x</B> indicates unattended installation.
<P><LI><B>/r&#58;</B> indicates that the name
of a response file follows.
<UL>
<P><LI><VAR>z&#58;\path\websrvr.rsp</VAR>
is the name of the response file to be used.
</UL>
<P><LI><B>/l1&#58;</B> indicates that the name of the error log
file follows.
<UL>
<P><LI><VAR>z&#58;\path\error.log</VAR> is the name of the file
where the installation procedure should write error messages.
</UL>
<P><LI><B>/l2&#58;</B> indicates that the name of the history log
file follows.
<UL>
<P><LI><VAR>z&#58;\path\history.log</VAR> is the name of the file
where the installation procedure should write information messages.
</UL>
</UL>
<P><B>Notes: </B><OL>
<P><LI>
There are no spaces between the parameter indicators (/r, /l1, and /l2)
