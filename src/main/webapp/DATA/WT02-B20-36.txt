  Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are provided 
for under three federal statutes: the Individuals with Disabilities Education 
Act (IDEA), Part B; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  State education agencies have 
ultimate responsibility for providing a free appropriate education for students 
with this disability by providing services directly, by contracting for 
services, or by delegating responsibility to local education agencies.  To meet 
legal requirements, schools must identify and provide services for eligible 
children, educate children with ADHD along with nondisabled children to the 
extent possible, eliminate practices and policies that allow disabled children 
to be suspended or expelled for more than 10 days for behavior associated with 
their disability, and follow procedural safeguards outlined in IDEA.  Because 
state education agencies are responsible for school oversight, a state's 
education policymakers have a clear mandate to formulate policy and develop a 
state plan for educating disabled students.  To prevent school failure for 
children with ADHD and unnecessary lawsuits, they must be sure the policy and 
plan are known and implemented in the state's schools.  Questions that 
policymakers need to ask about providing services to students with ADHD are 
listed.  Efforts in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia to train 
regular education teachers to educate children with ADHD are described.

appropriately educated, they are obligated to provide adequate leadership for 
developing the knowledge base and competence to secure Section 504 compliance 
(and avoid unnecessary penalties).  Section 504 applies to students with 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder who do not qualify under IDEA to 
receive necessary services.  (MLH)<BR>

  The crisis concerning attention-deficit-disorder students is overblown as a 
legal matter.  Although perceived acutely by particular parents and advocated 
aggressively by the Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorders 
(CHADD), the needs of ADD/ADHD students range from noneligibility to 
entitlement for full services under the Individuals with Disabilities Act.  
Providing proper evaluation and classroom accommodations is essential.  (MLH)<BR>

  This guide provides a survey of those laws that directly affect the child 
with attention deficit disorder (ADD), with or without hyperactivity.  The 
guide addresses three general classes of rights: (1) civil rights (for example, 
the right to equal treatment and opportunity under the law); (2) the right to 
society's support in educational services and disability payments; and (3) the 
right to exemption from military service.  The guide is divided into 14 parts, 
of which the first 3 are an introduction, an outline of the judicial system, 
and an explanation of equal protection and due process guaranteed by the U.S.  
Constitution.  Subsequent parts address the major federal laws which define the 
rights of individuals with ADD, including: the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; the Americans with Disabilities 
Act; the Social Security Act; and the Selective Service Act.  Other sections 
deal with individualized inquiry, state law remedies, court litigation, and 
parent advocacy.  A final section on resources lists approximately 20 
textbooks, policy documents, and organizations.  (JDD)<BR>

  Responds to previous article (Hakola, this issue) on legal rights of students 
with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).  Discusses resistance on part of special 
and regular educators to comply with law, calling resistance understandable and 
perhaps warranted when it stems from philosophical orientation, diagnostic and 
classification issues, and monetary concerns.  (NB)<BR>

  This manual, developed in Montana, is intended to assist schools in complying 
with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which requires the provision 
of services to people with disabilities in a nondiscriminatory manner.  The 
first section provides an introduction to Section 504, noting that some 
students not covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 
may be covered under Section 504.  The second section examines school district 
responsibilities under the law, including written assurance of 
nondiscrimination, designation of a compliance coordinator, grievance 
procedures, and procedural safeguards.  Eligibility procedures under Section 
504 for receiving a free appropriate public education are considered next, 
including referral, Section 504 student determination, evaluation procedures, 
the individualized program, placement, reevaluation, and procedural safeguards. 
A Section 504 policy/procedures checklist is attached.  The fourth section 
looks at special issues including transportation, residential placement, 
nonacademic services, program accessibility, students with special health care 
needs, students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and funding.  
Definitions of key terms in the law and a variety of sample forms to be used by 
schools are also provided.  Appendices contain: (1) the text of Section 504 as 
amended in 1990; (2) memoranda from the Office of Civil Rights regarding 
substance abuse, distinctions between Section 504 and IDEA, and attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder; (3) a systematic comparison of IDEA, Section 
504, and the Americans with Disabilities Act; and (4) additional resources.

  This paper examines issues concerning the eligibility of children with 
attention deficit disorder (ADD) for special education and related services 
under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  A policy 
memorandum was issued by the Department of Education in September 1991, 
identifying those circumstances under which such children are eligible for 
special services.  Such children are seen to qualify under IDEA's "other health 
impairments" category if ADD is a chronic or acute health problem that limits 
alertness, adversely affects educational performance, and requires special 
education.  They may also qualify under other IDEA disability categories or 
under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  The policy interpretation 
memorandum was issued after reviewing public comments required under the 
Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments (1990) and is intended to clarify 
for states and local school districts their responsibilities under federal law 
toward children with ADD.  Currently at issue is implementation of the 
Department's ADD policy and further consideration by Congress of eligibility of 
children with ADD under IDEA.  An appendix summarizes the history, causes, 
prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and educational implications of ADD.
