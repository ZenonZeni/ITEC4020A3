<h1>The Facts About Drug Abuse </h1>

<p> <b>The Drug Abuse Council, 1980</b> </p>

<p> <font size="5">Foreword</font> </p>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.gif"> </p>

<p> IN 1970, at the peak of the drug scare, the trustees of the
Ford Foundation decided that piecemeal measures were not enough.
As a first step in a major program the Foundation asked Patricia
M. Wald, now a United States Circuit judge in the District of
Columbia, and Peter B. Hutt, a Washington lawyer, to undertake a
survey in depth of drug abuse and to suggest what private
foundations might contribute to understanding, if not solution,
of the problem. In their report to the Foundation published in
1972 -Dealing with Drug Abuse-judge Wald and Mr. Hutt said: </p>

<p> It is of fundamental importance that man has and will
inevitably continue to have potentially dangerous drugs at his
disposal, which he may either use properly or abuse, and that
neither the availability of these drugs nor the temptation to
abuse them can be eliminated. Therefore, the fundamental
objective of a modern drug-abuse program must be to help the
public learn to understand these drugs and how to cope with their
use in the context of everyday life. An approach emphasizing
suppression of all drugs or repression of all drug users will
only contribute to national problems. </p>

<p> There is an urgent need for effective nongovernmental
leadership toward a more reasoned approach to drug abuse in this
country. A void exists that we believe can be filled by the
creation of a new Drug Abuse Council. In our best judgment, the
Council could successfully exert this leadership and could have a
substantial and beneficial impact on drug abuse in this country.<br>
</p>

<p> According to McGeorge Bundy, then President of the Ford
Foundation, <br>
</p>

<p> The second important step was to join with three other
foundations that have shared our concern with drug abuse-the
Carnegie Corporation, the Commonwealth Fund, and the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation-in financing one of the principal
recommendations of the report, namely, the establishment of an
independent national Drug Abuse Council.<br>
</p>

<p> (The Equitable Life Assurance Society joined the foundations
in contributing to the expenses of the Council.) </p>

<p> The Council was organized in January 1972, but only after it
had been determined that a widely representative board of
directors and a highly competent staff could be assembled for
about five years of active service. The last formal meeting of
the board was held in June 1978, and since then the President of
the Council, Dr. Thomas E. Bryant, and the staff have been
engaged in the preparation of this Final Report. </p>

<p> The Report demonstrates that widespread misuse or abuse of
dangerous drugs-not just heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, but
alcohol and caffeine, and a great variety of stimulants and
tranquilizers, some prescribed, some sold over the counter-is not
an evil that can be extirpated by legislation or other means. Yet
it is believed that an informed society, aware of the
complexities of the issues and evidence, will be better able to
cope constructively with the use of drugs. This belief underlies
this Final Report. </p>

<p> It is not the function of a foreword to anticipate the
findings and conclusions of a massive study. It would, however,
be gross neglect not to acknowledge in this foreword the
exceptional contributions of the directors, the officers and
staff and consultants of the Council, and the foundations and
many others who have enabled the Council to apply knowledge and
reason to the understanding and treatment of a major national
problem. These include: </p>

<p> Judge Wald and Mr. Hutt, the Co-chairmen, and James V.
DeLong, the extraordinarily able Executive Director of the Ford
Foundation survey staff, who produced <i>Dealing with Drug </i>Abuse-the
seminal study that led to the creation of the Council. </p>

<p> The directors of the Council for regular attendance at
meetings, for the information and wisdom and wit that enriched
the deliberations of the board, and especially Dr. Bryant for the
personal and professional qualities that underpinned his
indispensable leadership. </p>

<p> And, of course, the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie
Corporation, the Commonwealth Fund, the Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation, and the Equitable Life Assurance Society, for the
financial support essential to a major private enterprise. </p>

<p> And the Council here records special gratitude to the senior
officers and responsible staff of the Ford Foundation for six
years of unfailing interest and support.<br>
