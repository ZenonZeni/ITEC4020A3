<P>
A recent study by Michael H. Konig, M.D., et al, revealed that persons with schizophrenia taking Risperidal (risperidone)--as compared with haloperidol and placebo--experienced fewer movement disorders such as rigidity and tremor, while still receiving relief for symptoms of schizophrenia.  Write Dr. Konig at Hillside Hospital, 75-59 263rd Street, Glen Oaks, NY 11004.

<P>
In two 8-0 votes, a panel of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration voted on April 29 that risperidone is safe and
effective in treating schizophrenia.
<P>
The medication, much cheaper than clozapine and without the
dangerous side effect of agranulocytosis, could reach the
American market in a matter of months.
<P>
The FDA is still negotiating with risperidone's manufacturer,
Janssen Pharmaceutica, over guidelines for marketing the drug in
the United States. Great Britain and Canada recently approved it,
and Mexico is expected to do so shortly.
<P>
Risperidone is said to reduce or eliminate  psychosis and voices,
and it does not appear to cause sedation, blurred vision,
impaired memory, or muscle stiffness.
<P>
FDA approval of risperidone will mean that "thousands of young
people suffering from the life-threatening illness (of
schizophrenia) can have a chance to improve their lives -- lives
that have been too often ended or totally devastated by its
symptoms," declared Martin S. Willick, a psychiatrist, lecturer
at Columbia University and NAMI member, at the FDA hearing.
<P>
Speaking "as a parent of a schizophrenic son whose life has
been overwhelmingly affected by this disease," Willick noted
that consumers, family members and mental health professionals
were "enormously encouraged by the introduction of clozapine a
few years ago. We have seen some dramatic improvements and very
many good, though modest improvements."
<P>
But hundreds of thousands of patients -- including his son --
did not sufficiently respond to clozapine or other medications.
His son improved, but developed a potentially fatal blood
complication, and had to stop taking clozapine. Still, "the
improvement we saw...has given us hope that new drugs like
risperidone will help him as well," Willick said.
<P>
Thousands of Dollars Cheaper
<P>
No price has yet been established for risperidone in the U.S.,
which will be sold under the brand name Risperdal. But it is
expected to be cheaper than the average price of clozapine,
which requires expensive weekly blood monitoring, and together
the cost is more than $8,000 year. Risperdal is priced at less
than $800 in Canadian dollars for a year's supply.
<P>
Clinical trials of risperidone have inspired cautious optimism.
Wayne Fenton, MD and Beth Lee, RN at Chestnut Lodge Research
Institute in Rockville, MD report that several patients who have
not responded to other medications are responding well to
risperidone.
<P>
One of the patients at Chestnut Lodge said in a telephone
interview that she began to feel better after two weeks of taking
the medication.
<P>
Now, after eight months, she feels like a different per son:
"It's better than anything I've ever been on, and I've been on
everything. I don't hallucinate any more. I don't have delusions
or stereotyped thinking. I have a sense of humor now. I'm able to
communicate with people. I have a life now," she exclaimed.
<P>
Before risperidone, "I was pretty much a vegetable." She has
a volunteer job now, and hopes to go back to school in the
fall. Between episodes of her illness, she attended medical
school. "I want to catch up on lost time."
<P>
One NAMI member from Tennessee who has taken risperidone for a
year said in a telephone inter view that the medication has
alleviated his depression and "I'm thinking about getting a
job." Risperidone, he said, "is a pretty good medication, but I'm
still looking for a better one. It has caused me to gain a lot of
weight, and may be causing visual hallucinations."
<P>
His doctor speculates that the hallucinations may result more
from "the course of the illness than the risperidone," the NAMI
member noted.
<P>
Not a Miracle Drug
<P>
But neither Lee, the nurse at Chestnut Lodge, nor Kenneth Jobsan,
a psychopharmacologist in Knoxville, TN want to raise hopes too
high.
<P>
Some patients in Chestnut Lodge's relatively small study did not
respond well to risperidone, Lee said, and Jobson said only a few
of his patients have done better on it than on clozapine.
<P>
Three people who took risperidone "had a brief dramatic response
and then lost that response. We don't quite know why," Jobson
said.
<P>
Jobson did relate the story of a patient whose life may have been
saved by risperidone. The patient had to stop taking clozapine
when he was diagnosed with an aggressive lung cancer, for fear of
dangerous complications between clozapine and chemotherapy. 
<P>
Risperidone was substituted while the patient underwent
chemotherapy. Jobson said the lung cancer remains in remission,
and the patient has felt much better on risperidone than he ever
did on clozapine.
<P>
Families of people with schizophrenia have been anxious to see
risperidone available on the U.S. market for more than a year.
<P>
Many have expressed impatience with the FDA approval process.
"Several times a week, we get calls from family members who are
desperate because their relatives can't take clozapine or can't
afford it. They want to know how they can get risperidone, and
how soon other medications will be available," said NAMI Research
Advocate James Cromwell.
<P>
"We have to say, 'It's up to the FDA. But we are encouraged by
the action of the advisory committee.'"
<P>
Other Drugs in Pipeline
<P>
About 16 new medications to treat mental illnesses are in
development, according to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association. NAMI has asked the FDA to speed up its approval
process for these drugs on the grounds that mental illnesses are
"life-threatening diseases."
<P>
Between 10 and 15 percent of patients with schizophrenia, for
example, commit suicide. If the FDA put drugs to treat mental
illness on a "fast track," they could be approved in six months.
<P>
In testimony before the FDA, NAMI Legal Affairs Director Ron
Honberg urged the FDA to ensure that "promising new treatments
for (mental) disorders are made available to those who need them
as quickly as possible."
<P>
The FDA should "place the same emphasis and priority on research
and development of new treatments for schizophrenia as is put
into finding cures for other devastating illnesses such as heart
disease, cancer and HIV. The magnitude and impact of
schizophrenia and other severe mental illness on society and on
the individuals who suffer from them is as profound as any other
disease affecting Americans today...
<P>
"New medications can mean the difference between suicide or
life-long suffering in back wards of state institutions on the
one hand and opportunities to live meaningful, independent and
productive lives in society on the other ...
<P>
"These treatments will also lead to decreases in indirect costs
related to dependence on entitlements and lost productivity,"
Honberg said.
<P>

<A NAME = "start"><H2>STARTING RISPERIDONE AFTER CLOZAPINE</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>
What is the concern about stopping clozapine to start
risperidone?
<P>
On September 21, 1994, in response to concerns expressed by the
families of people with schizophrenia, the National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH) sponsored a workshop to explore the effects
of clozapine discontinuation and the availability of risperidone
(Risperdal), co-chaired by the authors.  During July and August
of 1994, NIMH began receiving telephone reports from patients'
families describing individuals with schizophrenia who had been
treated with clozapine and who were abruptly discontinued from it
and started on the newly available antipsychotic risperidone.  
<P>
In several cases, this rapid shift in medication was associated
with dramatic increases in clinical symptoms requiring
rehospitalization.  Existing guidelines for clozapine
discontinuation indicate that gradual tapering over one or two
weeks should take place.  Abrupt discontinuation should
only occur in response to severe side effects.
<P>
NIMH staff notified the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
conducted a literature review, and contacted a number of clinical
investigators who have studied these drugs as well as
representatives of Janssen and Sandoz pharmaceutical companies
(the makers of risperidone and clozapine, respectively).  
<P>
The literature search revealed several case studies reporting
what was described as "rebounding psychosis" following
discontinuation of clozapine and one controlled clinical trial
comparing clinical symptomatology following abrupt
discontinuation of chlorpromazine vs. clozapine.  In
the latter study, a subgroup of patients experienced symptom
increases that exceeded the levels originally present.
<P>
What have clinicians found?
<P>
Several leading clinical scientists attending the workshop
recounted their experience with clozapine discontinuation.  Some
noted that patients might experience an increase in symptoms
(following withdrawal of clozapine) more rapidly than with
standard antipsychotic (AP) medications due to clozapine's
shorter elimination half-life and the more rapid dissipation of
its clinical effects.  
<P>
Investigators discussed several instances involving people
abruptly discontinued from clozapine who then deteriorated
clinically.  In some cases, there were physical reactions
including nausea, diarrhea, and other symptoms that might
represent withdrawal of a medication with strong
anticholinergic effects.  Increases in schizophrenia symptoms,
which in a few patients were reported to be more severe than
those prior to beginning clozapine, were also reported by several
clinical researchers. 
<P>
It is not known whether worsening of clinical symptoms is more
problematic when discontinuing clozapine than standard
anti-psychotic medication, and there is very little hard data on
this subject, a point emphasized by representatives of Sandoz and
the FDA.  Therefore, we cannot say with certainty that clinical
deterioration is more rapid, severe, or frequent following abrupt
clozapine discontinuation, despite anecdotal and small-sample
evidence noted above.
<P>
Additional clinical observations suggested that some patients
recently taken off clozapine could also be at increased risk for
developing extrapyramidal side effects (EPS).  It was noted that
some people who had never experienced severe EPS were quite
sensitive to them as they were taken off clozapine, although this
sensitivity was temporary.  
<P>
If such patients were switched to risperidone, there could be
potential problems with the interpretation of these symptoms. 
Since much of the information on risperidone has emphasized
its relative lack of EPS, motor side effects and excitement might
be misinterpreted as a worsening of psychosis rather than
akathisia, a form a EPS.
<P>
What do NAMI and Janssen say?
<P>
Dr. Dale Johnson, representing NAMI, indicated that NAMI too had
heard reports of clinical deterioration in people removed from
clozapine.  He noted that a number of people with
schizophrenia are bothered by the requirement for weekly blood
drawing as well as the side effects of clozapine and may want to
try new medications.  In some cases, people may be subject
to abrupt discontinuation of clozapine in order to switch to
alternative treatments.
<P>
Dr. Jennifer Hardin, representing Janssen, indicated that while
many patients are now being treated with risperidone, clinical
trials prior to marketing did not use large numbers of patients
who had been treated with clozapine (or were non-responders to
standard AP treatment), so they could not evaluate its value for
such patients.  
<P>
Language in the risperidone packaging originally indicated that
patients should be discontinued from other AP medications
immediately before starting risperidone.  Dr. Hardin noted that
labeling instructions were being modified to indicate that
patients beginning risperidone should no longer be rapidly
discontinued from previous AP treatments.  The package insert now
states:
<P>
There are no systematically collected data to specifically
address switching from other antipsychotics to Risperdal, or
concerning concomitant administration with other antipsychotics. 
While immediate discontinuation of the previous antipsychotic
treatment may be acceptable for some patients, more gradual
discontinuation may be most appropriate for other patients.  In
all cases, the period overlapping antipsychotic administration
should be minimized....The need for continuing existing EPS
medication should be reevaluated periodically.
<P>
What should consumers and families watch for?
<P>
To summarize, the NIMH recently brought together a group of
psychopharmacology research experts to discuss reports of
clinical deterioration (psychotic symptom increases, physical
withdrawal symptoms, and EPS) in some individuals with
schizophrenia who had been abruptly discontinued from clozapine. 
<P>

Consumers and families are reminded that the recommended
withdrawal schedule for clozapine indicates that ONE TO TWO weeks
should be expected for tapering off clozapine, and some
clinical researchers have suggested longer taper durations. 
SWITCHING FROM CLOZAPINE
TO RISPERIDONE DOES NOT MEAN THAT SUCH TAPERING IS UNNECESSARY. 
<P>
We have no evidence that risperidone is responsible for producing
the clinical problems reported, as similar reactions have been
described in some individuals abruptly discontinued from
clozapine due to side effects (prior to the introduction of
risperidone).  Those who wish to try risperidone
should also be aware that it may not produce all of the same
benefits as clozapine, and it has not been proven effective for
treatment-resistant schizophrenia.  
<P>
People who are doing well on clozapine and are able to tolerate
its side effects may not be good
candidates for clozapine discontinuation.  Questions raised by
family members about how best to make transitions from one
treatment to another may now stimulate much-needed studies on
these important issues and thereby help shape future research
designs.

<A NAME = "tardi"><H2>TARDIVE DYSKINESIA (TD)</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>
What is TD?
<P>
Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a term coined in 1964, describes a set
of  abnormal, involuntary movements of the orofacial area or
extremities.
<P>
TD  is thought to result from prolonged treatment with the
neuroleptic  (anti-psychotic) medications that help to control
symptoms of severe mental  illnesses, particularly schizophrenia.
Tardive means "late"; dyskinesia means "movement disorder."
<P>
What are the symptoms of TD?
<P>
The symptoms of TD range from occasional to continuous, and from
barely  perceptible to blatant. At one extreme are slight
movements such as involuntary blinking, lip-licking,
tongue-twitching or foot tapping -- symptoms that may go
unnoticed even by the patient, his/her family or doctor.
<P>
At the other extreme are conspicuous movements such as writhing,
rocking, twisting, jerking, flexing and stiffening of virtually
any or all parts of the body.
<P>
Fortunately, the occurrence of severe cases of TD is relatively
rare (about 5 percent).
<P>
How do anti-psychotic drugs increase the risk of TD?
<P>
No one knows for sure, yet, how anti-psychotic drugs do what
they're supposed to do, much less how they increase the risk of
TD.
<P>
This, however, is clear: antipsychotic drugs change how nerve
impulses jump from one set of nerve cells (pre-synaptic neurons)
across a gap (synapse) to another set of nerve cells
(post-synaptic receptors).
<P>
The impulses are carried by substances called
"neurotransmitters". Anti-psychotic drugs block a particular
neurotransmitter called "dopamine," allowing little of it to
reach the post-synaptic receptors.
<P>
It is assumed (but not proven) that dopamine blockades in
various nerve pathways of the brain cause the unwanted effects of
anti-psychotic drugs. However, dopamine blockades in one key
nerve path way may also be responsible for movement disorders
including TD.
<P>
According to one hypothesis, the dopamine blockade results in the
post-synaptic receptors becoming hypersensitive to the little
dopamine that does leak through.
<P>
Constant (and possibly in creasing) doses of medications may be
needed to keep dopamine from playing havoc with the hyper
sensitive receptors.
<P>
Perhaps no single hypothesis will ever fully explain TD because
it may not be a single disorder. Instead, TD may encompass two or
more disorders -- each with a different cause and treatment. 
<P>
Recent studies suggest that other neurotransmitters such as
norepinephrine, serotonin, and GABA may play a role in the
development of TD.
<P>
To date, it is thought that all commercially available
neuroleptic medications cause TD. The experimental neuroleptic
clozapine, which is scheduled to become available for use in
selected patients in the U.S.A., is thought to not cause TD.
<P>
This observation lends considerable hope to the possibility that
better anti-psychotic agents will be developed.
<P>
If anti-psychotic drugs can cause TD, why use them?
<P>
Research literature provides ample evidence that for most chronic
patients, anti-psychotic drugs offer higher reliability, greater
effectiveness, easier accessibility, and fewer hazards than any
other treatment.
<P>
One study indicates that the relapse rate of acute mental
illness in a group staying on anti-psychotic drugs in a one year
period is about seven to 10 percent. For those going off
medication, the recurrence rate is between 70 to 80 percent with
a year.
<P>
What can patients and their families do about TD?
<P>
Maintain frequent contact with a psychiatrist well trained in the
use of anti-psychotic drugs. Maintenance dosages should be kept
as low as possible and still control symptoms.
<P>
New research is finding that doses can be reduced if careful
attention is paid to "prodromal" or early warning signs of
psychosis.
<P>
They should be discontinued when no longer need ed. No one should
take these medicines if they are not benefiting from them.
Usually neuroleptic medications are prescribed on a long-term
basis for diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
depression with psychotic features, bipolar illness and organic
brain syndromes.
<P>
Certainly, neuroleptics may be prescribed for additional
diagnoses, but if they are, it is important to discuss the
strategy with the prescribing psychiatrist.
<P>
Ask the psychiatrist to discuss the "risk-benefit ratio" of the
particular medication that is prescribed. Be alert to the
symptoms of TD as described in this pamphlet. Promptly call them
to the attention of your doctor. Support studies of TD and newer
neuroleptic medications.
<P>
How common is TD?
<P>
Long-term studies have determined that TD develops in 15 to 20
percent of the patients taking anti-psychotic drugs for several
years.
<P>
In the United States, where there are about 2 million people
afflicted with schizophrenia, that means at least 300,000 people
with TD.
<P>
Recent studies indicate that the average yearly incidence rate
(new cases) ranges from .04 to .08 per year. We see a relatively
constant rate of new cases during at least the first seven years
of treatment with neuroleptics. It is still unclear if this rate
continues to climb after this period of exposure.
<P>
Can patients at risk for developing TD be identified?
<P>
The risk of developing TD appears to be highest among elderly,
chronic patients who have taken the drugs for the longest
periods. That is all that is known at this time.
<P>
Is anyone doing research on TD?
<P>
Because of the increasing magnitude of the problem, much research
is underway. For example, the National Institute of Mental
Health has given a research team at Yale University almost
$1 million to find ways to decrease the major side effects of
antipsychotic drugs.
<P>
These researchers are developing alternate treatments, studying
risk factors, and experimenting with lowered drug doses to find
the point at which side effects disappear but the drugs are still
effective.
