A COALITION GOVERNMENT IS THE LIKELIEST OUTCOME

India has had ten general elections since it became independent in
1947. Four of them resulted in a change of government, but none
affected the basic continuity of its policies. So Indians should be
able to take the eleventh election -- likely to be held in April -- in
their stride. But there is an almost palpable nervousness in political
circles in New Delhi, for all the available evidence suggests that no
party will win the 273 seats needed to gain a majority in parliament.
This election, therefore, is likely to be followed by a period of
haggling between parties, from which a coalition may eventually emerge.

Congress, which has ruled India for all but three and a half of the
past 48 years, is no stranger to electoral setbacks. In 1989, under
Rajiv Gandhi, it gained only 198 seats. In the last elections it
improved its tally to 219 (though subsequently it managed to increase
its strength). In 1977, after Mrs Indira Gandhi had declared an
Emergency and jailed thousands of her opponents, the Congress won only
153 seats. But on all these occasions, the party retained its dominance
of Indian politics, a dominance inherited from 75 years of leading the
struggle for independence. When coalitions of other parties formed the
government, the public saw them as temporary occupants for they
contained parties who had united only to oust Congress from power.
Congress therefore remained the dominant force and continued to set the
agenda for the country.

This long era is drawing to a close. The reason why the next election
may bring it to an end lies in India's first-past-the-post system of
voting which systematically magnifies the proportion of seats gained by
the largest party in relation to its votes and diminishes the share of
seats of smaller parties. Congress has never secured an absolute
majority of the national vote. The closest it came to doing so was in
1984 when Mrs Gandhi's assassination generated a huge wave of sympathy
for the party and gave it 49.1 per cent of the vote. On other occasions
the Congress has received between 36.5 per cent (1977) and 47.8 per
cent (1957). However, this has usually been sufficient to give the
party a comfortable majority in parliament.

The Congress party could easily have lost its dominance as far back as
in 1984. In a string of 23 by-elections spread across the country in
May of that year, it received less than 37 per cent of the vote. But
then Mrs Gandhi was assassinated with the consequences mentioned above.
However, by 1989, when elections became due again, the party's vote had
dropped to 37.8 per cent once more.

Exactly the same thing happened in 1991, when Rajiv Gandhi was
assassinated in the middle of the elections after two-fifths of the
constituencies had gone to the polls. An analysis of the voting before
and after the event shows that Congress gained around 5.5 per cent of
the vote out of sympathy. This gave it 219 seats and over 38 per cent
of the vote. But that wave too has spent itself. Various by-elections
and, less ambiguously, the Congress' loss, between December 1994 and
March 1995 of state elections in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and
Maharashtra, which had been its strongholds for the past four decades,
have shown that even holding 32 per cent of the vote will not be easy.

In a proportional representation system 32 per cent of the vote would
have given it around 180-185 seats -- or just enough to be sure of
emerging as the dominant partner in a future coalition government. But
under the first-past-the-post system, even this figures seems beyond
its reach. The voting system, which has so far worked in favour of the
Congress, is likely to turn against it. The reason is that, while all
of Congress's rivals are much smaller than it is, their vote is not
spread evenly through the country but is concentrated in small parts of
it. Like inkdots on blotting paper, these local concentrations of the
non-Congress vote have now spread till they cover most of the country.
In most areas, therefore, the Congress is in imminent danger of being
reduced to the second position, and in one, UP, which elects one-fifth
of the parliament, it has already been pushed down to third place.

Should this happen throughout the country, it is even possible that the
Congress could end with not even a hundred seats. But such a debacle is
unlikely. In two or three states where it fared poorly in 1991, the
political pendulum will have swung in its favour and this will give it
a majority of the seats. Judging by recent state election results the
states most likely to swing towards Congress are Orissa in the east,
Madhya Pradesh in central India, and the tiny Himalayan state of
Himachal Pradesh. The Congress is also expected to make significant
gains in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

It is also possible that a significant number of people will vote
differently in the national election from the way they did at the state
level. These are middle class voters who generally tend to make up
their minds at the last minute, and they may chose stability and
continued economic reform.

If all these factors work in favour of the Congress, it may win around
160 seats. With its long term ally, the All India Dravida Munnetra
Kazhagam, a Tamil nationalist party from Tamil Nadu, the Congress could
command a stable 180 seats in parliament. While this would not be
sufficient for it to rule alone, it would virtually ensure that the
next coalition is led by it.

This is not, of course, a view shared by the Congress's main rival, the
Hindu-revivalist BJP. A recent internal review of its poll prospects by
the party is supposed to have shown that the party expects to win no
less than 260 seats (against the 119 that it has at present) and to
form the next government with the help of smaller groups that will
gravitate to it in quest of power. But this estimate flatters the BJP
unduly. More than nine-tenths of its support is concentrated in five
large and two mini-states: Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya
Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Himachal Pradesh. This concentration
enabled it to get 23 per cent of the seats in parliament with 21 per
cent of the vote in 1991, but it will effectively prevent it from
adding many more seats to its tally in 1996. To do so it must break
into new areas with enough votes to get past the post first. But a
study of past elections shows that while the party has succeeded in
deepening its hold, it has not succeeded in broadening it. In 1989,
when it put up 86 candidates outside its traditional strongholds, 85 of
them lost their deposit. The most it can hope for in 1996 is to capture
a few more marginal urban constituencies, where the lower middle class,
from which it draws most of its support, predominates.

Between the two of them therefore the two major contenders are not
likely to capture more than 300 seats in parliament. To whom will the
remaining seats go? The short answer is that two states, West Bengal
and Kerala, are dominated by the Communists (now the Left Front) while
another three states, Bihar, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are likely to
stay with the Janata Dal and its electoral ally, the Telugu Desam. All
these parties are part of a loose coalition called the National Front-
Left Front (NF-LF) which succeeded in getting 118 seats in the 1991
parliament. There is every likelihood that this coalition, despite its
inchoateness, will profit from the general disenchantment with Congress
and the unwillingness of large segment of the population to support the
BJP. It could end in a close third place with about 110-120 seats.

Since neither the Congress nor the NF-LF is prepared to deal with the
BJP, if the former (with the AIADMK) does manage to nose ahead with 160
or so seats, a coalition between it and the Left Front, with all or
part of the NF is a likely outcome. Such a government will undoubtedly
carry on the reform policies of the Rao government. But the weakening
of the centre that coalition politics entails, will almost certainly
cause a shift in the relative roles of the centre and states. Till now
it has been the centre that has made the running in reform. After the
next election the initiative will pass to the states, and the centre
will be left to hold the ring. This could mean that its role will be no
more than to pass enabling legislation that facilitates the states'
search for private capital to finance its projects.

However, if the Congress collapses and fails to get more than a hundred
seats, the lead would pass to the BJP. Very likely the Congress would
split and a part of it would join the BJP in its quest for a share of
power. India would then enter, abruptly, a new era of two-party
politics. For economic reforms this would be a bad outcome, for the BJP
is a xenophobic party. While its top leaders say they welcome foreign
investment in hi-tech and infrastructure areas, they have still to
realise that foreign investors have requirements of their own, and that
cutting off Kentucky Fried Chicken could also cut off IBM and Sony.

ECONOMY:  POWER SHORTAGES TAKE THEIR TOLL

In recent weeks, both the finance minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, and the
commerce minister, Mr P.Chidambaram, have stressed repeatedly that the
fundamentals of the economy are strong and there is no cause for worry
about its future. They are both right and wrong. The fundamentals are
strong: the gross domestic product grew by 6 per cent in 1994-95; the
rate of inflation has fallen sharply from over 10 per cent recorded at
the beginning of the year to below 7 per cent; the growth of exports
has been strong, and the trade deficit this year is not likely to
exceed $4.5bn (1.3 per cent of GDP).

But the strong fundamentals today are no guarantee that they will
remain so in the coming months. A close look at the most recent
statistics suggests that the economy is weakening and could weaken
further. Frequent revisions of the official statistics make all
estimates of growth somewhat tentative, but the growth in industrial
production, which was nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter of this
year, fell to 8.6 per cent in July. Preliminary estimates, based on
figures for around half of all industry suggest that there have been
further falls during August and September. In the last of these months
the index for 24 industry groups seems to have risen by a bare 4 per
cent.

Exports have been growing at 24.5 per cent in the first half of 1995-
96, but a closer look at the month-by-month data shows that this too
has been declining -- from 33 per cent in July to 20 and 19 per cent in
August and September, and 12 per cent in October. Fortunately, imports
too have declined, and even more sharply, so that the trade deficit can
be financed.

Inflation has come down, partly as a result of tight monetary policy,
and partly because of the almost total halt of foreign portfolio
investment and other capital inflows. From an average of $1bn a month
between October 1993 and November 1994, these fell to an average of
$100m in January to October 1995, and to a mere $39m in November. There
has been a corresponding fall in the growth of money supply in the
economy. By contrast the government's spending remains buoyant. A
recent study by the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy
has estimated that instead of coming down to 5.5 per cent of GDP this
year, the centre's fiscal deficit could climb to 6.9 per cent against
the 6.7 per cent recorded last year. This is probably a far too
pessimistic a forecast, but there is no doubt that the high fiscal
deficit remains a source of future inflation.

The reasons for the slowdown, both in industrial growth and exports,
are not difficult to fathom. Thanks to a less than optimal south-west,
and a poor north-east monsoon, the country is now in the grip of a
severe power crisis. The output of hydroelectric power slumped by 19
per cent in July to September over the same period of 1994. The poor
north-east monsoon ensures that this shortage will worsen in the coming
months. There are power shortages everywhere, but the southern and
western states in particular are reeling under the severest power cuts
in almost a decade. These cuts have directly affected manufacturing
industries, and that in turn has begun to affect exports.

Apart from this, the combination of a lax fiscal policy and a tight
monetary policy has raised interest rates to very high levels. This is
helping to slow down the economy. Another factor is the anxiety among
investors, both Indian and foreign, over the political outlook. The
worry is not just the normal one that precedes a general election, but
has to do with the probability that this election may bring into power
a government that may not have the strength to complete the reform
programme. This is causing some loss of confidence, whose symptoms are
the fall in the value of the rupee, the inability of the stockmarket to
recover and feverish speculation in real estate.

DABHOL:  MAHARASHTRA FINALLY APPROVES ENRON PROJECT

After months of muscle flexing and dithering the Maharashtra government
has finally cleared Enron's power project at Dabhol. At the same time
the state government also cleared two other power projects in the
state, Reliance's 410 MW gas based plant at Patalganga and the Nippon
Denro Ispat-led consortium's 1082 MW coal-based plant at Bhadrawati.
The three projects will add a total of nearly 5,000 MW of installed
power generating capacity in the state.

While the clearance of the Dabhol project has ostensibly led to lower
capital costs reflected in a lower cost per unit of electricity, the
Maharashtra chief minister Manohar Joshi did not release all the
details of the renotiated deal. Under the revised terms offered by the
government and accepted in principle by Enron, the 695 MW first phase
and the 1390 MW second phase have been combined and total cost reduced
by Rs10.56bn to Rs80.04bn. Enron has also been permitted to hive off
its Rs15.8bn regassification plant into a separate company, a step
whose implications are not yet clear.

The plant will now be operated on naptha instead on LNG and the cost of
power has been reduced from around Rs2.10 per kWh for the first phase
to Rs1.86 per kWh for both the phases. The annual escalation of around
4 per cent has also been disallowed and Enron will supply power at the
same dollar rate for 17 years. However, costs have been calculated at
Rs32 to the dollar while the rupee is currently trading at over Rs35 to
the dollar and may decline further.

In another important decision the Maharashtra State Electricity Board
will now hold 30 per cent of the total equity in Enron's Dabhol project
for Rs5.78bn. Equipment for the second phase will now not necessarily
be bought from Enron's partners General Electric and Bechtel but will
be on open tender for which Indian companies can also bid.

Manohar Joshi claimed a savings of Rs250bn for the state over the
lifespan of the project but in the absence of details this is difficult
to verify. While welcoming the decision, Kenneth Lay, CEO of Enron
Corporation, said, "We are willing to consider recommendations that
provide for a mutually satisfactory project".

The ruling Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party coalition in Maharashtra
will try to present the deal it has secured from Enron as a victory,
but it is no secret that a wing of the BJP is unhappy about the
outcome.

NARASIMHA RAO NAMES THE MONTH

The elections to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of parliament) will be
in April. Prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao stated this on January 6,
but declined to specify the dates. He also said that parliament will
meet once again in February to approve a vote-on-account for the year,
the regular Union budget being postponed until after a new government
settles in. The dates for the elections are fixed by the election
commission and the government in consultation with each other. Earlier,
the election commission had announced that the elections would be held
in either February or April, the month of March being unsuitable
because it coincides with the sowing season and university
examinations.

VIOLENCE IS EXPECTED DURING THE ELECTIONS

The airdropping of arms into a country is a worrisome development in
the best of times. When it comes just before a general election, there
is even greater cause for alarm. The discovery last month that small
arms, including several hundred AK47 rifles, were clandestinely dropped
near an abandoned airfield at Purulia in West Bengal by foreign
mercenaries has added a new element of uncertainty to the polls. Though
there is no clear indication so far whom the arms were meant for,
speculation has centred around a Maoist faction in Bihar, a
paramilitary Hindu religious organisation, or an attempt by a foreign
country to instigate violence during the elections.

Every successive election since the 1970s has witnessed increasing
violence in the form of intimidating voters or "capturing" polling
booths by musclemen to stuff ballot boxes. In the past two years,
elections have been better conducted because of the reforming zeal of
chief election commissioner T.N. Seshan. Now, the near certainty of a
hung parliament may encourage more violence. The mysterious arms drop
at Purulia has added a nasty edge to that possibility.

TWO STATES DISPUTE THE SHARE OF A SINGLE RIVER

In the past the Indian subcontinent has witnessed wars over the use of
river waters. More recently, though India has had disputes over the
sharing of river waters with three of it neighbours -- Pakistan, Nepal
and Bangladesh -- they have either been satisfactorily resolved or admit
of a possible solution. Within the country, the sharing of river waters
has led to conflict between neighbouring states through which a river
passes. When conflicting positions could not be resolved by the
concerned states, a tribunal has been set up to adjudicate and award
the sharing of waters.

Of the five such cases referred to tribunals, four (Narmada, Krishna
and Godavari in the Deccan, and Ravi and Beas in the north) have been
sorted out. The fifth, the sharing of the waters of the Cauvery, has
once again become a bone of contention between Karnataka and Tamil
Nadu, the two states which depend most heavily on its waters. The
Cauvery is one of the most intensively used rivers in the world with
some 92 per cent of its waters being used for irrigation by a system of
dams and canals. The roots of the century-old dispute lie in the fact
that, while Tamil Nadu has used most of the waters, Karnataka feels the
irrigation potential in the state was not allowed to be properly
developed by the British.

Karnataka wants a greater share of the waters and has been building up
its irrigation potential which has led to a reduction in the existing
supply to Tamil Nadu. The matter is so linked to the prosperity and
even survival of farmers in the two states that neither can see the
other's point of view. Coming as it does before the general election,
there were fears that passions may be aroused on both sides leading to
street violence as happened in 1991.

Karnataka, through which the upper reaches of the river and its
tributaries pass, was asked by the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal to
release 205 tmc ft (thousand million cubic feet) of water to Tamil Nadu
annually but disputed this on every count. This year matters got worse
since the north-east monsoon (October to January) which normally gives
over half the annual rain to Tamil Nadu, failed. Over 1.3 million acres
of paddy were in danger of being lost. Tamil Nadu approached the
Supreme Court to order Karnataka to release 11 tmc ft of water
immediately to save the crop. The court passed on the buck to prime
minister P.V. Narasimha Rao asking him to ask the states to come to a
settlement, failing which he should do what he thought was best.

Rao appointed a committee of experts and decided that Karnataka must
release 6 tmc ft at once. Karnataka chief minister Deve Gowda agreed
reluctantly but there was an immediate backlash of anger in the state.
Tempers also ran high in Tamil Nadu and Rao was put in the sticky
position of mediating between two warring sides on the eve of an
important general election. If violence had broken out the Congress
party's prospects would have been affected in both states. With tempers
now having cooled, Rao can have the satisfaction of having made the
best of a bad job.

STOCKMARKET:  THE MONETARY BRAKES ARE STILL ON

In terms of value, Indian shares are currently attractive. For the long-
term investor, the market should be bought. But in the short-term there
are some impediments to the start of a bull market. For one thing,
money is very tight. This is increasingly threatening to stifle
economic growth. For another, the manner in which stockmarket reforms
are being conducted does not inspire confidence in investors.

Money is tight because the government has taken the virtuous path of
borrowing to finance its deficit instead of monetising it as it used to
do. This has kept inflation under check, but it is squeezing the
private sector. Many companies are finding it difficult to get money,
even at high cost. Financially sound companies are having to pay
interest rates at over 21 per cent. Some of them had raised money
through equity issues in India and abroad when their shares were in
demand; foolishly, many of them invested the proceeds in equities or
real estate. Companies are therefore short of money and many projects
are getting delayed. Even where they had received commitments to borrow
funds from domestic financial institutions (DFIs), they are finding the
going tough. DFIs themselves are starved for funds and are delaying
disbursements of loans.

The DFIs are scrambling to raise money primarily through the debt
route. ICICI, for example, managed to raise about Rs7bn recently,
through a five year bond, but had to pay a coupon rate of 16 per cent
despite the instrument being rated triple-A. That amount would suffice
for less than two months of its loan sanctions, after which it will
need to float another issue. All other DFIs are simultaneously planning
issues and the total works out at Rs50bn. The main subscribers are
provident funds, but their additional annual inflow is only Rs6bn.

The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has
issued a warning that unless the monetary situation is eased, the
economy will slow down. Recently the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has
helped a little by cutting CRR, in effect pumping some Rs25bn into the
system.

The second worry is the slow pace of stockmarket reforms. All the
systemic problems relating to settlement and delivery which plague the
Indian capital market system have their root in the absence of a
central depository. The trading systems have been largely modernised,
with the introduction of screen-based trading. However, post settlement
delays in registration of shares deter foreign investment. In a report
by James Capel entitled "Emerging markets investment strategies -- Q4
1995", the Indian market is given neutral weightage, despite scoring
high on valuation, primarily because of poor liquidity of shares.
Annual traded volume (on the assumption of 250 days trading) represents
only 8 per cent of market capitalisation. Compare that with the leader,
Taiwan, which stands at 194 per cent, or South Korea (59 per cent).

The government had, through an ordinance, introduced legislation paving
the way for a central depository. Unfortunately, the bill never got
passed in the upper house of parliament. It is to be re-promulgated. If
it is not approved before the current parliament is dissolved, it will
mean a six month wait.

Sebi, the regulatory body, seems incapable of enforcing discipline. It
recently suspended the largest merchant banker, SBI Capital Markets,
for its role as lead manager to the controversial MS Shoes issue -- it
did not prevent misleading TV advertisements from appearing. SBI
Capital Markets has refused to accept Sebi's verdict and promises to
appeal, right up to the Supreme Court if necessary. It knows that
judicial delays make a mockery of any disciplinary action.

In another episode, Sebi declared itself unable to prevent another
merchant banker, which had defaulted on an underwriting commitment,
from making a public issue. Sebi is also unable to take quick action
against companies consistently delaying transfer of shares. Though it
has instituted legal proceedings against five companies, the Indian
legal system is not capable of delivering justice quickly.

As long as the capital market system is unable to cope with investment
needs of millions of individual investors, it is inevitable that the
mutual fund industry will grow. The industry had recently been
restricted to the public sector, mainly the banks and the UTI. Absence
of competition has bred complacency, and returns have been inadequate.

Now Sebi has issued guidelines for the mutual fund industry. They spell
out things such as the basis for computation of net asset values. More
importantly, they seek to link fees payable to asset management
companies to the performance of the funds. It is imperative that the
mutual fund industry grows in order to fill the vacuum left by the
reduced role of the UTI.

The UTI has been under a cloud recently. In September 1994, it had
bought shares of Reliance Industries as a price of Rs385 per share, in
a private placement deal worth Rs7bn. The share now quotes at around
Rs200, entailing not only a sizeable monetary loss for UTI, but more
importantly, a loss of investor confidence. More recently, it has been
embroiled in the Reliance switching of shares controversy, although it
has had the shares replaced subsequently.

UTI's future is important for the stockmarket because it controls funds
totalling some Rs650bn. Its largest scheme, the US '64 scheme, is an
open ended one, in which it is largely exposed to the corporate sector.
If, because of the tight money position faced by the companies, they
make redemption calls en masse, the resultant selling by UTI would hurt
the equity market.

On a positive note, the figures for the seven months to October reveal
a healthy trend in many sectors where the market is well represented.
Production of cement is up 9.7 per cent, of saleable steel 10.3 per
cent, and the auto sector is doing well with a 23.6 per cent increase
in production of cars and 32.3 per cent in commercial vehicles.

The boom in the auto sector is riding on the back of easier credit
availability from auto finance companies. Kotak Mahindra Finance (KMFL)
has cut a good deal with Ford Motor Company, with which it has entered
into two separate joint ventures. One will be to finance vehicles which
Ford will produce in India. The equity will be held by Ford (55 per
cent), KMFL (35 per cent) and Mahindra and Mahindra (10 per cent),
Ford's partner.

The more interesting deal is the other JV, in which KMFL will hive off
its existing (non-Ford) car financing business. In this, Ford will hold
a 40 per cent stake, bringing in Rs1.4bn, whilst KMFL will hold the
balance, bringing in Rs6m. Over the next eight years, Ford will
increase its commitment to Rs5bn, as will KMFL proportionately, leaving
the ratio the same. The deal makes KMFL a good share to pick up. KMFL
will also receive Rs4bn as royalty for Ford over the next ten years.

In other corporate developments of interest, Yogi Deveshwar has taken
over as Chairman of ITC, India's largest tobacco company, despite the
objections of BAT, the largest single holder with a 31 per cent stake.
Devashwar's appointment was made possible with the backing of
government-controlled financial institutions, holding 37 per cent. He
has landed into a hot seat. At the start of the new year, the
government has re-opened an excise dispute and has claimed Rs8bn as
penalty for past excise defaults. The share price dipped from Rs242 to
Rs229 on release of the news, but quickly firmed up to end the
fortnight at Rs233, on reports that BAT had set aside $60m to acquire
an additional 6 per cent stake in the company (see page 15).

The BSE is to reintroduce a forward trading mechanism from January 15.
The market is hoping that this will bring back investors. But with
interest rates at such high level, forward trading will be expensive.

BUSINESS:  NEPC GOES INTO BATTLE FOR MODILUFT

Five years ago, the Madras-based NEPC group was practically unknown. It
was a new player in a new arena -- wind energy. And though the Khemkas,
who own the group, were thinking big even then, most corporate
observers were prone to dismiss their grand plans as just so much wind.

No longer. Last month, NEPC made an open offer for the Rs4bn (expected
1995-96 turnover) ModiLuft. With the company's promoter S.K. Modi not
only marshalling his defences but also taking the battle to the
opposition camp by threatening a suit claiming Rs25bn in damages, this
is a battle that has placed the Khemkas firmly on the front pages of
the financial press.

They have been there before. NEPC already has a successful airline --
NEPC Airlines -- a division of flagship NEPC-Micon. Earlier last year,
the company engineered a successful takeover of Damania Airways.
Initially billed as a management takeover, the Khemkas were later
forced to make an open offer to ordinary Damania shareholders by the
Securities & Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Along the way, NEPC also
picked up the Damania family holding in the company.

With the acquisition of Damania, the NEPC-Damania combine became the
largest private sector operator in the aviation sector. The ModiLuft
deal, if it comes through, should make this position unassailable. The
only big rival in the business -- East West -- is in no position to give
chase.  The company is still recovering from the shock of what is
alleged to be a gangland killing. Recently, its CEO, T. Wahid was shot
dead on the streets of Bombay while returning from work.

But ModiLuft is not going to fall in the Khemkas' bag without a battle.
The Khemkas had initially offered to take over 47.32 per cent of
ModiLuft's equity at a price of Rs29 per share. Curiously, the offer
was for exactly 47.32 per cent; the Khemkas weren't interested in a
lesser stake. Sebi is now looking into the legality of the offer which
S.K. Modi says is against the takeover code.

Besides, says Modi, he and his family control 60 per cent of ModiLuft's
equity. So the question of the Khemkas picking up 47 per cent does not
arise. NEPC chief Ravi Prakash Khemka, on the other hand, disputes
Modi's ownership figures. He claims to have done his homework and the
47.32 per cent figure has been carefully calculated: he is aware of the
ownership pattern and is confident of getting that much. According to
Sebi's norms, ModiLuft will have to reveal its shareholders list by the
end of January and the truth will out only then.

But some of the Khemka calculations have already gone awry. The
ModiLuft shares have spiralled past Rs29 (they were much lower when the
offer was announced) and the Khemkas are planning to raise their bid to
Rs35. This will mean an additional Rs180m to pick up the stake; at Rs29
the deal would have cost Rs870m. Khemka had initially suggested that
some large holders (including some foreign institutional investors)
were going to unload their holdings in his favour. But that does not
seem to be working out. Besides, NEPC has had its share of abortive
takeovers, particularly in the aviation arena. Last year, the promoters
of Sahara, a rival private airline, accused the Khemkas of slanting
takeover stories in the press. The Khemkas, however, explained that it
was only some sharing of facilities that was being discussed and the
media had put two and two together to make five. Later there was talk
of NEPC taking over two regional airlines -- UP Air and Gujarat Airways.
But these apparently didn't go through because of a change in the state
government.

But this time the Khemkas seem confident. Some critics, Modi amongst
them, suggest that the open offer is nothing more than a ploy designed
principally to scupper ModiLuft's expansion plans. ModiLuft has offered
its collaborator Lufthansa a 40 per cent stake and Khemka had sent
feelers to Modi that this holding be offered to NEPC instead. The
swadeshi card has also been dragged out in this connection; note that
the Singapore Airlines-Tata joint venture has proved stillborn because
there are many who feel that foreign airlines should not be given
significant holdings in the Indian aviation sector. Now it will be all
the more difficult for the government to approve Lufthansa's taking up
a 40 per cent stake in ModiLuft. Which means, in sum, that the Khemkas
have hamstrung what could potentially have been a major competitor.

But if Modi does decide to sell, do the Khemkas have the wherewithal to
buy him out? On the face of it, yes. The NEPC group is extremely cash
rich. The current value of the shares held by the Khemka family in
group companies is over Rs3bn and finding the Rs1bn or so required to
buy 47 per cent of ModiLuft should not be a major problem. Ravi Prakash
Khemka is, in fact, planning to fund the acquisition with his personal
money without taking recourse to his group companies.

But the group companies can well put up the funds if necessary. They
are all in fine fettle. NEPC-Micon (which has a tie-up with Micon of
Denmark) is a leading producer of electricity from windpower with a
marketshare of 80 per cent. NEPC Agro Foods, which was promoted in
1991, has established its Trupti brandname which is used for a wide
range of products from mineral water to basmati rice, packaged wheat
flour and spices. The group also has a presence in textiles with NEPC
Textiles (a textile unit in Coimbatore taken over in 1993) and paper
with NEPC Paper & Board (a paper mill in Muzzafarnagar, Uttar Pradesh,
acquired in 1994). And it is now entering the cement business by
acquiring the "sick" South India Cement in Karnataka at a cost of
Rs145m. The group has also gone into media with its own satellite
channel.

The Doubting Thomases, however, see in the Khemka saga many
similarities with that of takeover tycoon P. Rajarathinam who has
fallen upon hard times, with creditors baying for his blood and his
empire under siege. Both came out of the blue, both are known to be
close to a particular Tamil Nadu politician and both have a habit of
venturing into unrelated takeovers. Khemka has another cross to bear:
his younger brother Sashi Prakash has accused him of violating the
Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, forging share certificates and much
more. As is evident from Manu Chhabria's spat with his brother Kishore,
family squabbles often result in bringing high fliers down to earth.
Will Ravi Prakash Khemka prove the exception?

BUSINESS:  HOW RELIANCE LOST ITS HALO WITH INDIAN INVESTORS

Attack is not always the best form of defence. Reliance Industries Ltd
(RIL), which took umbrage at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) suspending
its scrip for three days for a minor peccadillo, should attest to that
by now. By threatening to delist itself from the BSE and move to the
National Stock Exchange (NSE) and by sending a legal notice to a
financial daily investigating the matter seeking damages of Rs20bn, RIL
ensured just the reverse of what it wanted.

RIL is still listed on the BSE. But the company and its suspect deals
are being investigated by the Securities & Exchange Board of India
(Sebi), the department of company affairs (DCA), the income-tax
department and the BSE. The press has now passed the baton to the
investigative authorities, so there are no daily exposes. But RIL
clearly has its back to the wall. Opposition MPs have demanded the
arrest of Dhirubhai Ambani; banks, financial institutions and insurance
companies have been asked by the government to verify their portfolios
(though RIL has not been named, this instruction is clearly targeted at
the company); and the initial sympathy for the Ambanis has been
replaced by growing concern, confusion and disbelief at their
manoeuvres. A public familiar only with ordinary equity and preference
shares has learned some new categories. Consider:

Duplicate shares: This is where it all started. One Rajul Vasa,
Dhirubhai Ambani's physiotherapist, wrote to the company claiming that
she had lost 26,650 RIL shares. She was issued duplicate shares which
she proceeded to sell. Earlier, however, she had sold her original
shares, and at the time when the duplicates were being issued, these
were with RIL's registrars -- Reliance Consultancy Services (RCS).
Reliance made good the loss of Rs10.6m and thought it was a closed
chapter. The BSE, however, decided to suspend it on this ground. RIL's
explanation is that it followed all the norms in the issue of duplicate
shares and the fact that the original shares were with RCS was not
detected because there was no system of cross-checking. There are no
rules or guidelines on this issue, says RIL.

Switched shares: While the Rajul Vasa issue was hogging headlines, came
the revelation that Unit Trust of India (UTI), which had sent 2.4
million RIL shares to RCS in 1991 for transfer, had got back 870,000
shares which were not part of the lot it had sent. These switched
shares had been frozen by the special court looking into the securities
scam. UTI took up the matter with RCS and the shares were replaced.

It later emerged that switching was a common practice as far as RIL was
concerned. By last count, more than 7 million shares have been
switched. Involved are not just UTI alone, but Peerless and some banks.
The motive behind the switching has still not been ascertained. RIL
says all companies do it but other business houses disagree. The Sebi-
DCA probe is now investigating this angle.

Some feel that UTI and other bulk purchasers were used as a dumping
ground for "tainted" shares (shares involved in the 1992 securities
scandal). No transactions were allowed in such shares by the special
court, but UTI and other institutions would be unlikely to try and sell
them. This explanation has subsequently been replaced by another. It
has been conclusively proved that Reliance investment companies and
trading associates were involved in all these transactions. The theory
is that Reliance trading companies sold large lots of shares but did
not have actual scrips in their possession (this is a normal practice).
When they had to make delivery, they "borrowed" shares from Reliance
investment companies. When these shares were sent to RCS, the original
sellers (the trading companies) replaced them with other shares which
they had acquired in the meantime.

How does this help? The Reliance investment companies hold shares which
they bought a long time ago, some even at par value. If these shares
were sold, capital gains tax would have to be paid on the price
differential, which would work out to a huge amount. So these were used
for delivery purposes and the shares actually sold were picked up from
the markets at higher rates. The capital gains tax was thus nominal. Is
this legal income-tax avoidance or illegal evasion? That will probably
be a matter for the courts to decide.

Fake shares: There are several strands to this. Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) leader Jaswant Singh has written to the finance minister pointing
out that two sets of RIL share certificates held by Syndicate Bank have
the same distinctive numbers but different certificate numbers. These
were among a lot of RIL shares sold by Syndicate Bank through a
stockbroking firm in 1989. The firm returned the certificates to the
bank as these would be treated as bad delivery in the market. According
to government sources, it is not possible for two sets of certificates
to have the same distinctive numbers. The inevitable conclusion: one is
a fake. RIL says that its records do not tally with those in the
certificates in the name of Syndicate Bank.

There are also several RIL share certificates bearing distinctive
numbers that go beyond the official list of distinctive numbers of the
paid-up capital of the company. This gave rise to the suspicion that
the company had issued more shares than its paid-up equity capital. RIL
has an explanation for this, but not everyone is convinced.

Apart from the shares, several other issues concerning Reliance are
creating controversy. An investigation is on into the possible rigging
of the share prices of Reliance Polypropylene Ltd (RPPL) and Reliance
Polyethylene Ltd (RPEL) before their merger with RIL. The big buyers
prior to the merger were companies close to Reliance. Among the names
also figures Rajul Vasa. Inevitably, Reliance has also got sucked into
the major controversy of the day -- the telecom tenders. The
controversial Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd (HFCL) has been
discovered to be another major buyer of RPPL/RPEL shares. HFCL sources
say their purchases weren't significant and they actually made a loss
on the deal. True, it wasn't significant as far as the RPPL/RPEL equity
goes. But the investment of Rs167m was a big sum for a small company.
Inevitably, opposition MPs have alleged that HFCL is only a front for
Reliance.

Most of these charges will not hold water. But some action is bound to
be taken. RCF's licence may well be suspended and the trading
associates and investment companies in the Reliance stable could be
slapped with an income-tax notice. The real damage, however, is in one
of perceptions. Reliance, once the darling of the stockmarkets, is now
being looked upon with suspicion. Foreign investors are also aghast
that the system permits such machinations. For the Ambanis, BSE-bashing
has proved more damaging than they could ever have expected.

BUSINESS:  ITC'S MISFORTUNE MAY WORK TO BAT'S ADVANTAGE

On January 1, Yogi Deveshwar took over as chairman of ITC. He won the
post, despite opposition from principal shareholder BAT Industries,
because of government support which manifested itself through the
financial institutions. On January 2, it was another arm of the
government which gave him a New Year's gift. The commissioner of
central excise, Delhi, passed an order against the company claiming
Rs7,990m as duty due from ITC and its contract manufacturers. In
addition, the commissioner imposed penalties on the company and six of
its erstwhile directors taking the total excise claim to over Rs8,700m.

ITC will be going to the Customs, Excise and Gold Appellate Tribunal
(Cegat) to appeal against the order, but in many ways the die seems
cast. The case is actually of ancient vintage; the excise claims relate
to the period between March 1, 1983 and February 28, 1987. Besides,
according to excise officials, ITC has already moved both the Calcutta
high court and the Supreme Court and lost.

The issue, though it has done the rounds of the courts and government
departments for several years now, is actually very simple. Excise
officials claim that ITC cut its dealer and retailer margins and
printed a lower price on its cigarette packets. It paid excise on this
printed price. The retailers, however, sold the packets to consumers at
a higher rate to make up their margins. This was done with the full
knowledge of the company. The authorities feel that ITC should have
paid excise on this higher price. It is also claimed that the printed
price was fixed in such a way that the consumers would inevitably have
to pay more. For instance, the printed price on a ten-pack of the best-
selling Wills Filter is today Rs11.75. But they are sold at Rs12 at all
outlets; nobody returns the loose change.

Observers feel that the best ITC can hope for now is a reduction in the
amount it has to pay. The payment could also be staggered. A precedent
has been set in the case of another cigarette manufacturer -- Godfrey
Phillips India -- which faced similar excise claims and fines of Rs570m.
In December, Cegat issued a partial stay of the excise order but asked
the company to pay around one-fourth the amount within three months. If
the same is done in ITC's case, the company will have to find Rs2bn
quickly. Where is the money going to come from? ITC could sell some its
investments in sister companies and finance the rest from its profits.
But this would mean weakening its hold on these companies and -- this is
worse -- displeasing shareholders who may have to go without dividends
for a couple of years.

The other solution is to go hat in hand to BAT. But the UK parent will
obviously demand its pound of flesh -- a greater representation on the
board, a greater say in the management and even an increase in equity
to 51 per cent. According to the Economic Times, India's leading
financial daily, BAT has already begun to buy ITC shares in the market
and has earmarked $60m for this purpose. That strategy may not make too
much sense, as control over ITC is not really a function of BAT's
holding; it depends on the stand the financial institutions take. Other
newspaper reports say that the ITC brass is now prepared to eat humble
pie; it has given up plans to go into power and other sectors and will
toe the BAT line. The excise axe may cost ITC dear but BAT, for one,
has some reason to cheer.

TELECOM:  BALL NOW IN SUPREME COURT

The telecom licensing issue saw the proceedings at the winter session
of parliament come to a total standstill as opposition members demanded
an investigation into the "biggest scam of the times". Apart from
passing some vital bills (such as the approval of President's rule in
Uttar Pradesh), no work could be done during the entire session.

The ball is now with the Supreme Court which has ordered a temporary
stay on basic telecom licences. This means that the tenders for the
five circles already finalised have also been put on hold. However, the
court allowed the government to go ahead with the retendering process
for the 13 other circles. The granting of contracts will only take
place after the final hearing which is scheduled for January 9.

The main argument of the petitioners in the case before the Supreme
Court is that public sector units have been discriminated against by
not allowing them to participate in the bidding, that the rules have
been loaded in favour of the multinationals and the private sector, and
that some private parties -- principally Himachal Futuristic
Communications -- have been given undue advantages.

TELECOM:  REBIDDING FOR THE BASIC CIRCLES IS LUKEWARM

The re-bidding for the 13 basic circles has received an extremely low-
key response. Only five circles were bid for with six companies
participating in the process. In the first round, a total of 16
companies participated with 81 bids being received for the 20 basic
circles on offer. The reason for the poor response is the uncertainty
over the entire issue. Companies are unwilling to commit themselves
before the Supreme Court judgement is delivered. Secondly, several
opposition parties have declared that they will cancel the entire
tendering process if they come to power after the next elections and
companies are not prepared to risk another Enron-type situation.
Besides, many contend that the reserve prices set by the telecom
department are too high to leave room for profits.

Of the circles thrown open for re-tendering, only Punjab attracted two
bids. Essar-Bell Atlantic was the highest with a quote of Rs14,251m
(levy quoted in terms of net present value). Bharti-STET bid Rs13,680m.
The reserve price was Rs12,700m. The bidders in the other four circles
were Tata-Bell Canada Rs13,127m (Andhra Pradesh; reserve price
Rs12,500m); RPG-NTT Rs36,051m (Tamil Nadu; Rs25,500m); Reliance-Nynex
Rs10,537m (Gujarat; Rs10,500m); and Usha-Moscow Telecom Rs1,400.6m
(Bihar; Rs1,400m).

Several majors such as AT&T-Birla, which had bid for four circles last
time, and US West-BPL, which had bid for five circles, stayed out of
the bidding in this round. Also significant is the fact that the bids
are much lower than what Himachal Futuristic Communication Ltd had
quoted before it had to give up the circles because of the cap imposed.
With several circles yet to be taken up, there is likely to be another
round of bidding soon.

TELCOM:  TWENTY LICENCES AWARDED FOR MOBILE SERVICES

Despite the ongoing controversy and the opposition demand that the
entire telecom privatisation process be put on hold until the Supreme
Court ruling, the government has awarded 20 licences to seven companies
for operating cellular mobile telephone services. The licences, awarded
on December 12, are for JT Mobile-Telia, Sweden (Andhra Pradesh and
Punjab); Birla Communications-AT&T, US (Gujarat and Maharashtra);
Escotel-First Pacific, Hong Kong (Uttar Pradesh west, Haryana and
Kerala), Koshika Telecom-Philipino Telecom, the Philippines (Uttar
Pradesh west, Uttar Pradesh east, Orissa and Bihar); Cellular
Communications-Airtouch, US (Tamil Nadu); Reliance Telecom-Nynex, US
(Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Orissa, Bihar, North-east, Assam and
Himachal Pradesh); and Bharti Telenet-STET, Italy (Himachal Pradesh).
The other licences will be awarded shortly.

TELECOM:  JOINT VENTURES MAY CHANGE THE MIXTURE

In another major change of norms, the department of telecommunications
(DoT) is likely to allow consortia which have won licences to operate
cellular mobile services in the country to change their composition.
This has become necessary because of both the continuing confusion over
the award of licences and the fact that, despite all this, the
prospects for business seem better. While those disenchanted with the
chaos want to pull out others want to raise their stakes in the joint
ventures. This is being opposed by their Indian partners. Take the case
of Koshika Telecom which has been granted licences to operate cellular
services in four circles -- Uttar Pradesh (east), Uttar Pradesh (west),
Orissa and Bihar. Koshika is a joint venture between Usha (India) and
Philipino Telephone Corporation, the largest cellular operator in the
Philippines. Usha (India) has dragged Philipino Telephone to Delhi high
court alleging that the company is threatening to pull out unless it is
allowed to hike its stake to 34 per cent. According to DoT
stipulations, the foreign partner cannot dilute its holding to below 10
per cent in the first three years. Thus, if Philipino does pull out,
the Koshika licences will become invalid. While the Delhi high court
has restrained Philipino Telecom from reneging on the deal, it is
recognised that Indian courts may not be able to do much if the foreign
partner is indeed bent on pulling out. DoT may thus have to agree to
the substitution of some other foreign partner.

According to Usha (India), Philipino Telephone has realised late in the
day that the prospects in the Indian telecom sector are indeed very
bright. Usha's counsel told the court that the foreign company is now
arm-twisting its Indian partner to get both a higher stake and a
greater say in the management. Another successful bidder Modicom
Network Private Ltd, which has won the circles of Punjab and Karnataka,
has approached the government with an application that the 26 per cent
stake of its original partner -- Vanguard of the US -- be transferred to
Australian giant Telstra International. Telstra is already operating
cellular services in Calcutta (which was awarded much earlier) with
B.K. Modi of Modicom, so it sees obvious synergies in a tie-up for
Punjab and Karnataka. Incidentally, Telstra had tied up with Spic to
bid for the current round of celular circles but its estimates were way
out of line. In Karnataka, Telstra-Spic bid Rs2,090m while winner
Modicom quoted a figure of Rs13,930m.

A change in partner is also on the cards in the Hinduja-HCL-Singapore
Telecom combine with Singapore Telecom expressing its desire to pull
out. Both the Hindujas and Modicom desperately need another foreign
partner because of the experience requirements DoT has insisted on.

AVIATION:  FOREIGN EQUITY OKAY, BUT NOT NOW

The government has decided in principle to allow up to 40 per cent
foreign equity holding in domestic airlines. But, in a curious rider,
it will not be giving any such blanket permission until the
modernisation programme for the aviation sector is completed. The
programme includes extension of runways, building of terminals and
modernisation of airports. As this is a subjective issue it means, in
effect, that the decision on foreign equity participation has been
postponed indefinitely. However, according to the civil aviation and
tourism ministry, approvals could still be given on a case-to-case
basis as has been done for Jet Airways. Among the applications which
have queued up at the civil aviation ministry's door are those from
Indotik (of the Ravi Tikkoo group) and the Tata-Singapore Airlines
proposal. The government would also have had to decide on the proposal
by ModiLuft to allow Lufthansa to take a 40 per cent stake, but the
foreign carrier is apparently not interested at the moment.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT:  POWER SECTOR ATTRACTS THE MOST MONEY

The infrastructure sector has been attracting the maximum foreign
direct investment (FDI) in the reform era. According to available data,
the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approved a total FDI of
Rs397bn in the period August 1991 to October 1995. Of this the power
sector accounted for the lion's share with Rs60bn (15.11 per cent). Oil
refineries attracted Rs40bn. The total fuel sector (which includes
power and oil refineries) added up to 27.01 per cent. The other big
chunk of FDI went for the telecommunications sector with a total
investment of Rs32.39bn (8.14 per cent). Of this, cellular mobile
telephone services accounted for Rs23.45bn (5.90 per cent). The
consumer goods sector, though the public face of foreign investment,
accounted for only 6.6 per cent (Rs26.27bn) of total FDI. Of this, food
processing provided the biggest chunk with Rs21.94bn (5.51 per cent).
The figures, however, tell only half the story as they relate to the
approvals and not the actual investment. In sectors such as power, the
FDI approval is very high. But most of the projects have been held up
because of various snags and the actual fund inflow has been small. On
the other hand, most of the investments in the food processing sector
have already been made.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT:  MULTINATIONALS LAW PLANNED

Existing multinational subsidiaries in the country are to be put on a
par with those seeking entry. Currently, even 100 per cent foreign-
owned companies can get into unallied lines of business by taking the
takeover/merger route. The government intends to introduce legislation
to debar such companies from getting into new lines of business unless
this is specifically mentioned in the articles and memoranda of
association. Under the current regulations, MNCs can enter new fields
by amending their articles and their memoranda of association in a
general body meeting. In the new scheme of things, central permission
will also be required for such diversification. This has become
necessary because some sectors are still barred for multinationals and
some areas are reserved for the small-scale sector. A few MNCs have,
however, succeeded in getting a toehold through takeovers.

POWER:  ABB SEEKS STAKE IN POWER COMPANIES

The $30bn power major Asea brown Boveri (ABB) is negotiating with
several new power projects in the country to pick up an equity stake in
them. ABB's main intention is to sell its equipment to these projects
and it would have been happy doing just that. Having a stake, however,
gives it the clear edge in equipment supply and is also an indication
of its long-term commitment. Negotiations are thus on with Videocon for
its 1,000 MW Madras project, with Basicorp and GVK for the
Krishnapattam project in Andhra Pradesh, with the Birla Powergen
combine for the Bena project in Madhya Pradesh and with Eisenberg of
Israel for the Yamunanagar project in Haryana. ABB is looking at a 5-20
per cent stake in all these projects. Incidentally ABB already has a 20
per cent stake in the 500 MW Pench project in Madhya Pradesh (Soros
Funds holds the other 80 per cent) and 5 per cent in the 235 MW
Jegurupada project. It will also be picking up a stake in the 250 MW
neyveli project.

HOTELS:  MS SHOES LOSES HOTEL SITE

Following his arrest after charges of price rigging prior to the public
issue of MS Shoes, the woes of promoter Pavan Sachdeva have been
multiplying. In his latest setback, he has been unable to retain the
four-star hotel and shopping complex site in New Delhi. The public
issue was raising money for its development. MS Shoes failed to pay
Rs130m of the Rs481m second instalment (including interest) by the
deadline of December 31. Hudco, which had sold him the land in the
first place, will now put it up for retendering as there is no
provision for offering the site to the second highest bidder in case of
default by the highest bidder.

This is not the first time that the beleaguered Sachdeva has failed to
meet his payment schedules. The second instalment was actually due on
April 30, 1995. But Sachdeva had moved the Delhi high court and
obtained a stay. The court had ordered MS Shoes to make the payment of
Rs415m (plus interest at 24 per cent) by December 31. Now that MS Shoes
has defaulted a second time, the stay stands automatically vacated.

HOTELS:  HOTEL LEELAVENTURE PULLS OUT OF HOTEL PROJECT

Hotel Leelaventure has backed out of the project to develop the Bombay
Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (BMRDA) hotel-cum-
convention centre in the Bandra-Kurla complex. Leela, which had won the
project with a bid of Rs11,330m, failed to make its initial payment
because of a technical hitch. Though the finance for the project had
been tied up, a consortium of financial institutions led by the
Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) refused to release funds
as BMRDA was unwilling to lease the land. While the institutions wanted
an immediate lease, BMRDA maintained that the land would be licensed to
Leela for the first three years and leased thereafter. This had been
specified in the tender offer and BMRDA was unwilling to change any of
the terms at the last moment. The tender had been a hotly contested one
with several multinationals tying up with Indian companies to submit
their bids. BMRDA will now float the tender again as some of the
combines which had submitted bids have since been wound up. However,
with land prices having dropped 15-20 per cent, it is likely to end up
the loser.

MEDIA:  MALLYA MAKES MEDIA ENTRY

Vijay Mallya has made an entry into the media arena with his purchase
of the tabloid Blitz. The paper has editions in English, Hindi and Urdu
with a combined circulation of around 50,000. Apart from Blitz, Mallya
is also negotiating with The Asian Age to launch a Bangalore edition of
the daily newspaper. This is not Mallya's first foray in this sector.
But his earlier venture with a business magazine styled Business Update
proved abortive. The UB group is also entering the electronic media. A
company styled UB Communications has been set up. UB has entered into a
50:50 cable TV venture with the US-based United International Holdings.
This apart, UB has also acquired the Madras-based TV channel Golden
Eagle Communications. Golden Eagle offers 24-hour Tamil programming.
