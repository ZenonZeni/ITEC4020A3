There is no verified information that needle distribution reduces the incidence
of HIV seroprevalence (positives) among intravenous drug users. There is
only self-reporting, anecdotal information. <BR>
<BR>
There are a number of international experiences that have been less than
satisfactory. The rate of HIV infections among addicts involved in heroin
maintenance programs in Switzerland ranges from 40% to 50% positive, despite
distribution of free, clean needles for at least 8 years. Italy and Spain
have a 70% rate of HIV prevalence among its heroin addicts, and needle sales
have never been restricted in those countries. The number of heroin addicts
and needle sales have never been restricted in those countries. The number
of heroin addicts per capita in Switzerland, Italy, and Spain is several
times that of the U.S. Sweden has run a needle exchange study since 1987,
and there is no statistical difference in the rate of HIV seroprevalence
in the cities where the needles are distributed and the non-participating
cities. A needle distribution program in Montreal reflects a four times
higher HIV seroconversion rate among participants, than non- participant
addicts. <BR>
<BR>
Distribution of clean needles cannot prevent overdose deaths or protect
the injector's immune system from being compromised by the drugs, causing
greater vulnerability to HIV, hepatitis, and other opportunistic diseases.
It does enable the addict to continue this harmful behavior. Clearly, drug
use (particularly intravenous use) is illogical and self-destructive. Advocating
the concept of needle exchange as a perceived method of reducing the risks
associated with needle- sharing is predicated on the theory that intravenous
drug users will make a rational decision to delay fulfilling their need
for their drug, while they seek out a clean needle to insure their safety!
<BR>
<BR>
It is an act of extraordinary faith to believe that people engaged in such
ultimately self-destructive behavior can or will make rational, healthy
decisions while fighting the ravages of withdrawal. The well- meaning activists
for needle exchange project their own thoughtful evaluation of the risk
of needle-sharing onto the dysfunctional thought processes of intravenous
drug users, a classic error. <BR>
<BR>
Needle use is not the only method of HIV transmission that affects drug
users. Prostitution and promiscuity are also high risk factors. Witness
the explosion of HIV positives among non-needle using crack addicts. Needle
exchange programs do not show any change in such dangerous sexual practices.
<BR>
<BR>
Federal funding of needle exchange programs is inappropriate and premature.
The science regarding the efficacy of needle exchange programs falls far
short of normal standards. Further scientific examination is called for
and should be used to determine the wisest course for us to follow. <BR>
<BR>
We must not be stampeded by fear and politically correct advocates whose
compassion clouds their judgement.
