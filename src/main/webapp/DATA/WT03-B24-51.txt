<p>
There is no standardized time frame for meetings, but most meetings
run from 3 to about 5:30, and we usually then find a resturant for
food, drinks, and further discussion. Some of the resturant conversations
have been wonderful and lasted for hours.

<li>We are going to try to get a couple of speakers to talk 
for about 30 minutes each. This will give the meeting a focus.
And perhaps it will attract new people. Volunteer topics/presentors
needed.

<a name="WhoIsDccp">
<h2>Who is on dccp?</h2>
DCCP is  
<a href="mailto:dccp@eff.org">dccp@eff.org</a>, a
mailing list for DC-area cypherpunks and 
others with interestes in privacy, cryptography, security, and networking. Since
the "networking" interests are in both the technical, electronic meaning
of the word, and the social and interpersonal meaning of the word, we
occasionally meet physically. The 
<A HREF="http://www.eff.org"> Electronic Frontier Foundation </A> 
has been kind enough to set up a mailing list on their node, eff.org.
<P>
The term "dccp" is a mixed choice. It is the obvious contraction
of DC CypherPunks. Lots of the members are in the
greater Washington DC area. The locals in this area use the term "DC"
when they mean the city, Washington, DC, that is the capitol of
the US. The term is used mostly because it is short, and partly
to differentiate it from Washington State, or towns like
Washington, Virginia.
<p>
Dccp is actually larger than its name. Many of the folks on the list are
from farther away. We regularly see folks from Baltimore, and people
have traveled from as far away as New York, NY. to attend our meetings.
<h2>Who is in charge?</h2>
In short, no one. There is no list of members, no officers, no voting rules,
etc. Folks who are interested in organizing a meeting, do so, and announce it.
The founders of the main cypherpunks list are crypto-anarchists, many
on the dccp are too, although no single label does justice to such a 
diverse goup.
