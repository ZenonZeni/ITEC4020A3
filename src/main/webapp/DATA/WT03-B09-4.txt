IL JUDGE DISMISSES PEDICLE SCREW CASE AS IMPERMISSIBLE

         In dismissing a complaint filed on behalf of 11 plaintiffs
who alleged injuries from implanted spine plate pedicle screws, a
federal judge in Chicago called the suit "an impermissible
lumping together of plaintiffs and defendants" and said the
claims must be filed separately.  Jarmasek et al. v. AcroMed
Corp. et al., No. 95-C-7095 (ND IL, Eastern Div.).

         "It simply will not do for counsel to put together this type
of hodgepodge in anticipation that it may be worked into
respectable size and shape through the efforts of the court or
opposing counsel or both," said Senior U.S. District Judge Milton
I. Shadur of the Northern District of Illinois.

         In his Dec. 6 order, Judge Shadur dismissed the suit with
leave for the plaintiffs to refile an amended complaint by
Dec. 19.  According to court records, an amended and restated
complaint was filed by the plaintiffs on Dec. 14.

         Joseph J. Jarmasek and 10 other plaintiffs filed a complaint
on Dec. 5, alleging that AcroMed Corp. and 99 other defendants
were responsible for injuries allegedly sustained from implanted
pedicle screws.

         "All 11 plaintiffs have a common grievance: the implanting
of a spine plate pedicle screw," Judge Shadur said.  "But of
course the several implant operations were performed at different
times and almost without exception at different hospitals."

         The judge criticized several problems in the complaint,
including the plaintiffs' engagement "in a type of boilerplate
rote repetition of allegations about defendants' purported
contacts with this district that seems very likely to be
demonstratably false."  The ability to obtain personal
jurisdiction over many of the defendants is extremely doubtful,
Judge Shadur said.

         "In addition, the inclusion in this action of some of the
categories of joined defendants (particularly, though not
exclusively, the individual defendants) would seem highly
problematic as they relate to any of the plaintiffs (and perhaps
as to all of them)," the judge said.
                   He said the litigation must be reduced to manageable
proportions in compliance with the rules of the court, and must
be supported by allegations that will be able to pass the
objective good faith standard of Rule 11.

         Representing the plaintiffs were Mark E. Stone of Kurasch &
Stone in Chicago; John J. Cummings III of Cummings, Cummings &
Dudenhefer in New Orleans, LA; and Cary Michael Saperstein of the
Law Office of Michael D. Mannis in Chicago.

PLAINTIFFS ASK PA JUDGE TO DENY DISMISSAL OF CLAIMS

         Nine plaintiffs in the orthopedic bone screw multidistrict
litigation in Philadelphia asked Senior U.S. District Judge Louis
C. Bechtle on Dec. 5 to deny a motion by defendant AcroMed Corp.
to dismiss their claims based on alleged noncompliance with
Pretrial Order No. 6.  In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products
Liability Litigation, No. 1014 (J.P.M.L.).

         On Nov. 22, AcroMed moved the court to dismiss the claims of
nearly 600 plaintiffs, including William E. Biddle Jr., Cynthia
L. Glenn, Mattie Tripp Johnson, Maureen Leckie, Ann F. Little,
Bradley J. Little, Patricia Harper Whitley, Dan K. Whitley and
Johnny W. Taylor.

         In its motion, the company asserted that the plaintiffs were
compelled by Pretrial Order No. 6 to submit completed
questionnaires providing basic background and authorization to
enable defendants to obtain medical records within 60 days of
receiving the order.

         The plaintiffs argued in their response that each plaintiff
complied, in good faith, with the requirements of Pretrial Order
No. 6.

         "AcroMed believes that its interests in this litigation are
best served by seeking the wholesale dismissal of plaintiffs'
claims based upon any possible deficiency that AcroMed can point
to with respect to Plaintiffs' compliance with Pretrial Order
No. 6," the response stated.

         The plaintiffs are represented by John P. Kopesky of
Sheller, Ludwig & Badey in Philadelphia.  AcroMed is represented
by Richard I. Werder Jr. of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in
Cleveland.

bi-weekly report filed Dec. 11 by the defense liaison counsel.
In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Products Liability Litigation,
No. 1014 (J.P.M.L.).

         The report, filed pursuant to Pretrial Order No. 68, details

COURT STAYS NOTICE PENDING MOTION TO RECONSIDER CERTIFICATION

         Senior U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel on Dec. 15
ordered that the notice to class participants in the Telectronics
Pacing Systems, Inc. litigation in Ohio be stayed pending the
resolution of the defendant's motion to reconsider the court's
order certifying the class.  In re Telectronics Pacing Systems,
Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" Leads Products Liability Litigation,
No. 1057 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV95-87 (SD OH).

         Judge Spiegel on Nov. 17 granted a motion to certify a class
of plaintiffs who claimed they were injured as a result of
allegedly defective pacemaker "J" lead wires.  In his order, the
judge granted certification on four of the plaintiffs' 11 causes
of action that stem from allegedly defective Telectronics Pacing
Systems Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" pacemaker leads that were
implanted into the plaintiffs.

         The plaintiffs assert that about 15% of the company's
pacemaker leads are J-shaped in design.  Telectronics had used
the J-shaped lead since December 1987 for pacemakers that are
specifically designed to stimulate muscle in the atrium of the
heart.

         The plaintiffs alleged that from December 1987 to October
1994, Telectronics manufactured and sold its pacemakers, a
significant portion of which contained defective leads, on a
continuous basis.  According to the plaintiffs, about 40,500 of
the company's J-leads were implanted into patients worldwide.

         Judge Spiegel ordered the plaintiffs to file their response
to Telectronics' motion by Jan. 2, and Telectronics to reply
before Jan. 9.  A hearing regarding the motion to reconsider
class certification has been scheduled for Jan. 26.

         The plaintiffs are represented by Louis Gilligan of Keating,
Muething & Klekamp in Cincinnati; and by Stanley M. Chesley and
Terrence L. Goodman of Waite, Schneider, Bayless & Chesley Co.,
L.P.A., also in Cincinnati.

         Telectronics is represented by Frank C. Woodside III and
James A. Comodeca of Dinsmore & Shohl in Cincinnati; and by
Charles P. Goodell Jr., Richard M. Barnes and Ian Gallagher of
Goodell, DeVries, Leech & Gray in Baltimore.

TELECTRONICS SAYS NAMES OF CLASS MEMBERS SHOULD BE KEPT PRIVATE

         In a Dec. 4 plan for notice of the pendency of the class
action, defendant Telectronics Pacing Systems, Inc. objected to
the plaintiffs' provision to provide the Plaintiffs' Steering
Committee with computer disks and labels identifying the names
and addresses of all class members in its possession.  In re
Telectronics Pacing Systems, Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" Leads
Products Liability Litigation, No. 1057 (J.P.M.L.), No. CV95-87
(SD OH).

         In its plan for notice of the pendency of the class action,
Telectronics said it must operate under the regulatory
requirements of the Food and Drug Administration, which requires
that patient names and addresses be kept confidential and be
protected from public disclosure.

         As an alternative to the plaintiffs' proposal, Telectronics
proposed that it produce a list identifying all patient names and
addresses under seal to the court, which would prepare the
notification for mailing to the class members.

         "In this manner, the confidentiality of the patient records
can be preserved, while at the same time notifying members of the
class of the pendency of this class action," Telectronics said.

         Translations of the class notice and press releases should
be made " at the plaintiffs' expense " in order to adequately
inform members of this world-wide class who live in predominately
non-English speaking countries, Telectronics said.  Those
countries include Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Japan, Italy,
Belgium, Jordan, Iran, Iraq and Mexico.

NORPLANT PLAINTIFFS, DEFENDANTS ARGUE ON MEDICAL MONITORING

         In response to U.S. District Judge Richard A. Schell's order
regarding medical monitoring, plaintiffs and defendants in the
Norplant multidistrict litigation argued on the issue of medical
monitoring as a viable cause of action.  In re Norplant
Contraceptive Products Liability Litigation, No. 1038 (J.P.M.L.).

         Judge Schell on Sept. 25 ordered the parties involved in the
Norplant litigation to brief whether each state would recognize a
claim for medical monitoring and what physical injury information
would be required in order to bring such a claim.

         In a Nov. 30 brief, the plaintiffs argued that medical
monitoring is a viable cause of action and that every
jurisdiction would recognize medical monitoring as a recoverable
element of damages.

         "Although some jurisdictions require an existing physical
injury to warrant medical monitoring, that factor is present in
every plaintiff by virtue of the fact that mere use of Norplant
requires invasive surgical procedures to both insert and remove
the product," the plaintiffs said.

         The plaintiffs urged the court to follow In re Paoli R.R.
Yard PCB Litigation, 916 F.2d 829 (3rd Cir. 1990), cert. denied,
499 U.S. 961 (1991), and In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litigation, 35
F.3d 829 (3rd Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S.Ct. 1253 (1995).
In those cases, the plaintiffs said, the courts held that medical
monitoring is a viable cause of action.

         Another case cited by the plaintiffs is In re Telectronics
Pacing Systems, Inc. Accufix Atrial "J" Leads Products Liability
Litigation, No. 1057 (J.P.M.L.).  In Telectronics, the plaintiffs
contended in a footnote to their brief, the judge certified
medical monitoring as a separate class without making any
distinction between the laws of the various jurisdictions.

         The plaintiffs maintained that the court must analyze each
legal issue individually to determine which state has the "most
significant relationship" to each claim.  The places where the
individual plaintiffs were injured do not play a major role, the
plaintiffs said, because where the plaintiffs were injured is
unrelated to the defendant's conduct, which occurred in
Pennsylvania.

         Defendant Wyeth Laboratories developed, tested, marketed and
placed the Norplant contraceptive into the stream of commerce in
Pennsylvania, the plaintiffs said.  Accordingly, the plaintiffs
said, Pennsylvania has the greatest number of relevant contacts
with the litigation.

         "In this case, virtually every act conducted by Wyeth which
renders it legally liable for the claims brought by the
plaintiffs occurred in Pennsylvania," the brief stated.  "Thus,
in accord with the choice of law in this jurisdiction, the Court
should select the law of Pennsylvania to uniformly govern
plaintiffs' medical monitoring claims."

         In support of medical monitoring relief, the plaintiffs said
they are suffering from physical symptoms such as excessive
menstrual bleeding, recurrent headaches, weight gain, hair loss,
depression and mood swings.  The plaintiffs said they are
concerned about other long-term medical problems that they may be
experiencing that cannot be detected without medical monitoring.

         "The acceptance of medical monitoring as a separate claim
for relief is the trend in the law and is clearly the law in
Pennsylvania, the principal place of business of Wyeth
Laboratories and the state which has the most significant
contacts with this litigation," the plaintiffs said.

         On the other hand, the defendants argued in their brief that
no law exists in the majority of the jurisdictions of the
plaintiffs in the Norplant multidistrict litigation that touches
upon the issue of medical monitoring.  The defendants argued that
the court must answer no for those class members from
jurisdictions that have not recognized medical monitoring as an
independent tort.

         After the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' decision
recognizing a cause of action for medical monitoring in Paoli,
the defendants argued, another Pennsylvania court rejected the
Third Circuit's ruling.  In Addams v. Westinghouse Electric
Corp., No. 1340 C.D. 1988, slip op. at 16 (PA C.P. Ct., Mercer
Cty., July 30, 1993), the court held that "an action for medical
monitoring is inappropriate."

         "For this Court in this case to recognize a cause of action
for medical monitoring in 31 jurisdictions would be to replicate
these other courts' errors in a far grander scale," the
defendants maintained.

         The defendants argued that a nationwide Norplant class
action predicated upon state law claims such as medical
monitoring would be unmanageable and "would constitute an
unwarranted intrusion by a federal court into areas best left to
local courts resolving individual actions."

         "This problem " how to intuit and then apply the law of 64
jurisdictions " demonstrates that there is something
fundamentally wrong with the course plaintiffs would have this
Court chart," the defendants said.

         The court should deny the plaintiffs' request for class
certification prior to ruling on the defendants' motion to
dismiss, thereby eliminating the need to create the law for the
31 jurisdictions that never have addressed the issue of medical
monitoring, the defendants concluded.

         The plaintiffs' brief was submitted by Christopher M. Parks
of Parker, Parks & Rosenthal, L.L.P. in Port Arthur, TX.  The
defendants' brief was submitted by Lawrence Germer and Paul Gertz
of Germer & Gertz in Beaumont, TX; and by John W. Vardaman, F.
Lane Heard III and Steven M. Farina of Williams & Connolly in
Washington, DC.

TRANSFER OF NONDEBTOR CASES OPPOSED BY TX PLAINTIFFS, MS DOCTORS

         Breast implant plaintiffs from Johnson County, TX, and a
consortium of physicians from Mississippi late last month filed
with the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals their briefs
opposing the challenge of the nondebtor defendant-appellants of a
district court finding that breast implant claims against the
nondebtors are not related to the Dow Corning Corp. Chapter 11
case.  In re Dow Corning Corp.; Lindsey v. O'Brien, Tanski,
Tanser and Young et al., Nos. 95-2034, 95-2106, 95-2082, 95-2084,
and 95-2107 (6th Cir.).

         The appellees contend that U.S. District Judge Denise Page
Hood did not err in ruling that the jurisdiction of her court is
limited to only those cases that are related to the core
bankruptcy proceeding.  The district court properly held that
because the appellees' state law claims against the nondebtors
would not affect the administration of the bankruptcy estate, it
did not have jurisdiction to hear those actions under 28 U.S.C.
Section 1334(b), the appellees said.

         At issue is Judge Hood's Sept. 12 memorandum opinion and
order in which she held that her court does not have jurisdiction
over breast implant claims against nondebtor defendants.  Claims
against nondebtor defendants are not "related to" the Dow Corning
bankruptcy, the judge said, citing to Pacor, Inc. v. Higgins, 743
F.2d 984, 994 (3rd Cir. 1984).

         Citing again to Pacor, Judge Hood noted the similarity of
the cases and held that "there will be no contingent claim by the
Shareholders against the debtor for indemnification until such
time as a judgment is rendered and, then, the non-debtors would
still have to proceed with an entirely separate proceeding in
order to obtain indemnification from the Debtor under 11 U.S.C.
Section 502.  Joint tortfeasors are not indispensable parties in
the federal forum.  The Bankruptcy forum provides for a mechanism
to resolve the debtor's liability for indemnification should a
judgment be rendered against the Shareholders."

         The appellants contend that the judge's holding that she
lacks jurisdiction over breast implant claims against the
shareholders under 28 U.S.C. Section 1334(b) is "clearly wrong."
The Sixth Circuit has often found that "related to" jurisdiction
under Section 1334(b) is fairly broad and that jurisdiction
exists if the claims at issue may "conceivably" affect the
bankruptcy estate, the appellants said.

Mississippi Physicians

         The Mississippi Physicians argued that the appellants have
failed to show that judicial economy would be served by the
district court's retaining jurisdiction over the cases at issue.
Judge Hood properly decided that the district court need only
concern itself with the cases that are central to the
administration of the Dow Corning bankruptcy estate, the
appellees said.

         "The claims by the Plaintiffs against the Non-Debtor
Defendants for indemnification and/or for joint and severed
liability with Dow Corning are contingent," the appellees said.
"It is unnecessary to join all tortfeasors in one action.  There
is no evidence of the impact the state court litigation will have
on Dow Corning's bankruptcy estate.  Accordingly, this Court has
no interest in the state court litigation in which any proceeding
against Dow Corning is stayed by virtue of 11 U.S.C. Section
362."

         Further, the Mississippi Physicians said, "[s]ince the opt-
out cases are stayed as against Dow Corning, the bankruptcy
estate will not incur litigation costs, nor should any judgment
in favor of Plaintiffs against the Non-Debtor manufacturer
Defendants be binding on the Debtor or incur a cost to the
estate.  These cases are unrelated to the bankruptcy case, and
not subject to removal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 1452.  Thus,
this Court should affirm the District Court's ruling that it had
no jurisdiction over the Non-Debtor's claims."

Johnson County Plaintiffs

         "The arguments of the Third Party Nondebtors that the claims
against them are 'related to' Dow Corning's bankruptcy are simply
disingenuous," the Johnson County plaintiffs argued.  "First, the
Third Party Nondebtors argue that the claims against them, if
allowed to proceed, will undermine Dow Corning's bankruptcy case.
However, the arguments offered in support of this allegation,
namely, their common law right of contribution from Dow Corning,
are without merit.  Indeed, the Third Party Nondebtors failed to
present any evidence to the District Court of even one single
case in any forum anywhere in the United States in which any of
the Nondebtors have filed a cross-claim against Dow Corning for
contribution, even though thousands of cases have been pending
against those same Third Party Nondebtors for almost four years!"

         The plaintiffs went on to argue that "[a]lthough there may
exist shared facts in cases against Dow Corning and those
asserted against the Third Party Nondebtors..., the plaintiffs in
the underlying state court proceedings have alleged that the
liability is joint and several, thus providing an independent
basis of liability as to the Third Party Nondebtors....  The only
possible effect the estate may sustain in the present proceeding
is the speculative diminution of potential estate assets by
virtue of the utilization of insurance defense proceeds."

         The Mississippi Physicians are represented by Chris J.
Walker, Delia Y. Robinson and J. Hale Freeland of Markow, Walker,
Reeves & Anderson, P.A. in Jackson, MS.

         The Johnson County plaintiffs are represented by Daniel W.
McDonald of McDonald, Clay & Crow, L.L.P. in Fort Worth; J. Mark
Howell and J. Kevin Clark of Clark & Howell in Fort Worth; Frank
Cain of Bowers & Cain in Fort Worth; Michael P. McGartland of

Law Offices of Ben C. Martin in Dallas; and Russell L. Munsch and

LAWYER NOT REQUIRED TO ANSWER SETTLEMENT QUESTIONS, COURT RULES

         A lawyer for Dow Corning Corp. is not required to answer the
Tort Claimants Committee's questions about whether the debtor
believes the amounts of settlements with breast implant
plaintiffs are reasonable, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J.
Spector ruled Dec. 1.  In re Dow Corning Corp., No. 95-20512
(ED MI Bankr.).

         The Tort Claimants Committee is conducting a Rule 2004
examination of debtor Dow Corning Corp. (DCC).  The committee
asked DCC's managing trial counsel, Douglas Schoettinger, whether
he had any reason to believe that the amounts for which DCC
settled some 200 breast implant claims were not reasonable.
Schoettinger said yes, but then refused to provide further
information, invoking the work product privilege and attorney-
client privilege.  The committee sought to compel him to provide
further information, but Judge Spector denied the request.

         He said the committee failed to show that it could not
obtain the information from other sources.  Judge Spector also
found that DCC had not waived the privilege merely by saying it
had reason to believe the settlement amounts were unreasonable.

         "The Debtor has given no clear indication, nor do I see any
reason to assume, that it will be using privileged information in
an attempt to prove that the agreements are unreasonable," he
said.  "Thus there is no justification for making a finding of
waiver based on the 'truth-garbling' rationale.  One could posit
numerous ways in which the reasonableness of the settlements
could be determined through the use of objective, non-privileged
information."

CIBA IMPROPERLY LABELED CONTACT LENS SOLUTION, APPELLANT ARGUES

         Ciba Vision Corp., knowing that its AOSEPT contact lens
solution had been injuring hundreds of consumers, failed to
comply with Food and Drug Administration regulations that
required "common sense" in deciding to strengthen its product
warnings/labels, appellant Leslie Scott contended in reply to
Ciba's answer to her petition for review by the California
Supreme Court.  Scott v. Ciba Vision Corp., No. S049608 (CA Sup.
Ct.).

         Scott argued that she received no advance warning through a
consent form of the danger of misidentification of the product
containers of Ciba's AOSEPT solution, which contains hydrogen
peroxide, and saline solution.

         Scott brought suit against Ciba, alleging claims of strict
liability, negligence, failure to provide adequate warnings and
breach of implied warranty.  She claimed she had difficulty in
distinguishing Ciba's AOSEPT solution from its saline solution.
As a result of the indistinguishable bottles, Scott said she
suffered chemical burns to her eyes when she rinsed her contacts
in the AOSEPT solution.

         Around the time of her injury, Scott said, Ciba began to
market its AOSEPT solution with a red cap, but also continued to
market it in the old bottle, knowing that persons not wearing
their contact lenses would have trouble in distinguishing the two
bottles.

         The Santa Clara County Superior Court granted Ciba's motion
for summary judgment, finding that Scott's claims were preempted
by the Medical Devices Amendments (MDA) to the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act.  On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Sixth
District, affirmed the trial court.

         Scott petitioned the state Supreme Court for review, arguing
that the only other state Supreme Court that has addressed the
issue of federal preemption of Class III devices concluded that
the plaintiff's claims were not preempted (Larsen v. Pacesetter
Systems, Inc. [Hawaii 1992], 837 P.2d 1273, 1281).

         In response, Ciba argued that approved labels and warnings
on medical devices are "specific requirements" of federal law
that preempt causes of action brought under state law.  The
company maintained that the appellate court's ruling was aligned
with a majority of jurisdictions that have held that federal law
preempts causes of action brought under state law.

         In her Nov. 27 reply, Scott said the Court of Appeals cited
two cases in its decision that are not relevant to this case.  In
Evraets v. Intermedics Intraocular, Inc. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th
779, and Powers v. Optical Radiation Corp. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th
1444, the cases involved experimental products for which adequate
warnings were not yet known, Scott said.
                   Ciba's statements that this case is a "pure label and
warning case" and that Scott "makes no claim for any defect in
the design" are disingenuous and completely inaccurate, Scott
argued.

         "Respondent is well aware that Leslie Scott claims that the
design of the two virtually indistinguishable white product
containers containing harmful and harmless ingredients
respectively are defective under both negligence and strict
liability theories," she stated.

         The reply was submitted by Jonathan D. Gordon of the Law
Offices of Jonathan D. Gordon in Pleasant Hill, CA.

SUIT ALLEGING MALFUNCTIONING PENILE IMPLANT IS SETTLED

         Noting that the case has been settled, U.S. District Judge
Jan E. DuBois of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania last month
dismissed as moot motions for and against summary judgment in a
personal injury action brought by an Arizona resident for
injuries allegedly sustained after surgical implantation of an
inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP).  Werner v. American Medical
Systems Inc. et al., No. 95-1856 (ED PA).

         Plaintiff James Werner received the implant on March 5,
1992, in an operation at a hospital in Harrisburg, PA.  Following
the surgery, Werner allegedly experienced side effects.  On
March 25, 1993, an attempt to remove an infected prosthesis was
unsuccessful.  Subsequently, a diagnosis of an infected
prosthesis was made, and another operation was performed to
remove it.  After the operation, the plaintiff was told he could
not receive an implant of a properly functioning prosthesis,
rendering him permanently impotent.

         In their motion for summary judgment, defendants American
Medical Systems Inc. and Pfizer Inc. argued that Werner knew of
his injury and its cause more than two years before he initiated
his suit.  Werner, on the other hand, argued that the statute of
limitations had been tolled by certification of a class action
suit in the Southern District of Ohio against American Medical
Systems and Pfizer Inc. concerning similar allegations involving
their IPP, and that claims of negligent design and strict
liability could proceed in any event because neither the Medical
Devices Amendments nor the Food and Drug Administration had
imposed specific design requirements on the device.

         Werner was represented by John P. Kopesky of Sheller, Ludwig
& Badey in Philadelphia.  The defendants were represented by John
W. Frazier, Richard G. Placey and Sally Ackerman King of
Montgomery, McCracken, Walker & Rhoads in Philadelphia, and by
Daniel J. Johnson, legal counsel to American Medical Systems Inc.

9TH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS INJUNCTION ON MANUFACTURER OF DEFIBRILLATORS

         A Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals panel on Dec. 28
affirmed a district court's issuance of an injunction against a
manufacturer of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) for
alleged violations of the Medical Device Recording (MDR)
regulations.  United States v. Laerdal Manufacturing Corp. et
al., No. 94-35780 (9th Cir.).

         The panel upheld the district court's findings that
defendant Laerdal Manufacturing Corp. failed to timely file a
report with the Food and Drug Administration after one of its
AEDs allegedly failed.

         The litigation involves a Laerdal AED that was applied in
June 1993 to a man in cardiac arrest in Grand Rapids, MI.  The
device allegedly did not apply any shock to the man's heart, and
the man died after the AED was disconnected and an ambulance crew
applied its own defibrillator.  Laerdal did eventually file a
report on the incident, but argued that the circumstances of the
incident did not make filing a report necessary.

         After the U.S. government filed suit against Laerdal, the
U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon determined that
the company had violated 21 C.F.R. Section 803(a)(1)(i), which
requires a manufacturer to file a report with the FDA whenever
information is received that suggests that a patient care device
may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury.

         Laerdal argued that the district court improperly imposed
the injunction because there was no cognizable danger that the
company would violate the MDR regulation in the future.  Laerdal
asserted that the Grand Rapids incident was an isolated incident
and that the company has taken the necessary steps to prevent
future violations.

         The Ninth Circuit rejected Laerdal's contention of the
isolation of the Grand Rapids incident.

         "The [district] court developed at length the facts
surrounding the incident in Grand Rapids that first brought
Laerdal's reporting practices to the FDA's attention, but the
court also found testimony in the record that Laerdal had
received complaints of other instances in which a Laerdal AED
failed to work properly," the panel said.

         The district court also found that Laerdal had an ongoing
history of not implementing proper FDA reporting procedures, the
panel said.

         "Even if the district court had found evidence of only one
violation, Laerdal is in error in asserting that one violation
provides insufficient grounds for granting an injunction," the
panel concluded.
                   The panel cited its decision in Burlington Northern Railroad
Co. v. Department of Revenue of the State of Washington, 934 F.2d
1064, 1074-5 (9th Cir. 1991).  In Burlington, the court
determined that a statutory injunction may be imposed when a
violation of a statute has been or is about to be committed.

         "Laerdal's repeated self-justification is sufficient to show
a likelihood of future violation," the panel stated.  "Even if
Laerdal had not intended to violate the regulation, its continued
insistence on justifying its actions in committing the violation
'is an important factor in deciding whether future violations are
sufficiently likely to warrant an injunction.'"

         The panel also rejected Laerdal's argument that the public
interest was not harmed because the FDA allegedly suffers from a
backlog in filing its reports and the Grand Rapids report would
have languished for several months before being filed.

         "The public interest addressed by the MDR regulations
centers not on the efficiency of the FDA, but on the attention
manufacturers pay to evidence that their products could be
causing or contributing to needless deaths," the panel stated.

         Representing the plaintiff was Craig J. Casey, Assistant
U.S. Attorney in Portland, OR, and Elizabeth Stein of the U.S.
Department of Justice in Washington, DC.  Counsel for Laerdal was
James F. Dulcich, Jeffrey D. Austin and James N. Westwood of
Miller, Nash, Wiener, Hager & Carlsen in Portland, OR; and by
Daniel G. Jarcho and Daniel E. Johnson of McKenna, Conner & Cuneo
in Washington, DC.
