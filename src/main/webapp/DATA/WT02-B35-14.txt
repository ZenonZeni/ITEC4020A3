GADONNEIX TO PRESIDE OVER GDF AFTER FRENCH TOP JOBS RESHUFFLE

Pierre Gadonneix has been appointed president of Gaz de France (GdF)
following the sudden move of his predecessor, Loik le Floch-Prigent, to
take over running the state railway company, SNCF. Employees of the
latter provided the backbone to the recent wave of strikes in France
(EER 449/15): le Floch-Prigent was chosen by Paris because he manages
to combine socialist politics with managerial competence.

Gadonneix, who was appointed the general manager of GdF in July 1987,
had already been passed over for the top job twice. In 1988, when
Jacques Fournier left, it went to Francis Gutmann. In 1993, Gadonneix
saw le Floch-Prigent appointed over his head.

It remains to be seen how far Gadonneix will pursue the
internationalist and market-oriented policies of his predecessor. He
must renegotiate the company's charter with the government, which
defines its activities. In its home market, GdF faces challenges from
both electricity and fuel oil, and could also face an assault on its
monopoly of gas distribution.

Internationally, Gadonneix must manage those GdF assets already
acquired in Canada, Uruguay, and the US. Eventually, he will also have
to face pressure from Brussels to deregulate, even if the European
Commission has concentrated on electricity in the first instance.

In a spell at the industry ministry, Gadonneix worked with liberally
inclined ministers such as Michel d'Ornano, Rene Monory, and Alain
Madelin. But he will face fierce opposition from the country's trade
unions to any liberalisation. The unions had already designated 4
January as the next day of action to defend French-style public
service.

In fact, le Floch-Prigent's plans to exchange shareholdings with the
Russian gas company Gazprom were always likely to cause problems if he
had got anywhere near putting them into practice. The fact that cur-
rent industry minister Franck Borotra favours selling minority stakes
to Elf or Norway's Statoil, or to individuals, will do Gadonneix no
favours.

The appointment of Gadonneix contrasts with the recent politically
motivated parachutage of Edmond Alphandery (EER 449/2) at the head of
Electricite de France (EdF). But like Alphandery, Gadonneix will take
part in nominating his deputy, thereby strengthening his authority,
though there was no awkwardness between Gadonneix and his former
president, as there was under the 'ancien regime' at EdF.

Among the names being mentioned for the general manager's post are the
current deputy general manager Jean Balazuc, as well as the director of
the industry ministry's energy department, Claude Mandil.

ITALY UNVEILS PLAN FOR ENEL SALE AND LIMITED DEREGULATION

With shares in hydrocarbons conglomerate ENI now trading on
international stock exchanges (EER 488/7), Italy has begun to firm up
plans to divest state power utility Enel.

The Enel sell-off will not, however, take place as rapidly as some,
including budget minister Rainer Masera, had hoped for. Instead,
premier Lamberto Dini opted for the more cautious approach favoured by
industry minister Alberto Clo: the privatisation will take place over
the next two to three years and will be accompanied by power sector
reforms.

There may be further changes in the Enel sell-off arrangements, not
least due to the uncertain governmental situation, with Dini having -
as promised - submitted his resignation at the start of the year only
for it to be rejected by Italy's president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

In the meantime, the administration said the government stake in Enel
could be lowered to less than 51%, even though this was the level
suggested by parliament.

In his losing arguments, budget minister Masera had pushed for speedier
and more comprehensive privatisation, saying that the government needed
to send "strong and clear-cut signals" to potential investors and that
Enel's fragmented sale would be "a grave error".

The government outlined a plan for a three-phase privatisation. The
first stage calls for the sale of a certain amount of Enel shares - the
figure of 30% has been mentioned - within the first few months of 1996,
coupled with changes in Enel's accounting and management, including
production, distribution and transport.

The second phase will involve the flotation of a second tranche and a
new government policy on electricity. The third part of the process
will see the sale of the last segment of shares to be sold, with the
state losing overall control but hanging on to a substantial interest.

Despite its privatisation, however, there seems little doubt that Enel
will continue to be the dominant force in Italian electricity, even if
in private hands. After the necessary go-ahead from the government's
anti-trust authority, which is now studying the Enel case, the utility
will retain certain exclusive rights, particularly in distribution.

Despite the proposed liberalisation, the government reaffirmed the
principle of the "single rate" and, among other guidelines, the
"universality of electric services".

As for production, this will be open to competition only for additional
energy supplies deemed necessary, including from abroad "on the basis
of reciprocity" and within EU regulations. Other producers can either
sell their energy to Enel or negotiate directly with "qualified
consumers", meaning large agencies or concerns.

Nationwide, Enel will be designated the 'single buyer' responsible for
distributing electricity from producers to distributors and users. High
voltage transmission will also be handled by Enel to some 70 municipal
utility companies.

Enel described such stipulations as "important because, while
substantially maintaining the unity of Enel, they open the market to
competition in harmony with EU regulations."

But the plan drew mixed reactions from observers. Some lauded the
cautious sell-off approach and the accompanying reforms, while others
said the scheme did not go far enough and fell some way short of full
liberalisation. The municipal utilities of the larger cities,
accounting for about 7% of electricity consumed in Italy, were
particularly critical. Enel accounts for about 79% of power used.

COMMISSION HOPEFUL ON POWER

The European Commission is still hoping to reconcile member states to a
single agreed text for deregulating the electricity market.

Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert recently told a conference
organised by the Les Echos newspaper in Paris that the Commission could
wait to see whether a consensus was possible in the New Year.

Elsewhere, Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis insisted that there
was no blockage, and that all contentious questions would be resolved.

When member states' industry ministers held their delayed Council
meeting on 20 December, they unsurprisingly failed to agree, but
promised to restart negotiations in the New Year. Furthermore, the
Commission pointedly failed to invoke Article 90-3 of the Treaty of
Rome, which allows it to impose directives.

The Spanish energy minister, who presided over the meeting, said that
all the difficulties were surmountable, and that all of the conditions
were in place to reach agreement in the coming months.

The Commissioners appeared to be taking the view that it was the
strikes and demonstrations in France that were impeding agreement,
since the French government needed to prove that it was serious about
defending 'public service'.

One possible structure of a compromise could be to designate power
distributors among those consumers allowed to choose where they bought
their electricity. This should provide a measure of freedom for the
supporters of liberalisation, led by Germany but including the UK and
the Nordic countries, while allowing France enough leeway to leave
Electricite de France largely in control of its electricity
distribution.

French industry minister Franck Borotra reiterated his claim that
France was happy to let large industrial consumers benefit from
competition, provided that it could continue to organise its market
around the idea of public service, which meant security and continuity
of supplies, along with equal prices and equal access.

CO2 TAX SCHEDULE IN JEOPARDY

The resignation of Austria's finance minister Andreas Staribacher on 2
January will likely postpone introduction of the country's proposed
energy/CO2 tax on gas, coal and electricity. The tax had been intended
as a companion measure to the levy on mineral oils and fuels which went
into effect last May (EER 431/8).

Staribacher had been under considerable pressure to impose the extended
tax as part of a programme to resolve an unbearably large budget
deficit projected for this year. State industry minister Viktor Klima
has now been named as his successor.

The energy tax concept was originally proposed to reduce CO2 emissions
in line with Toronto targets; when it became clear that the Toronto
goals would not be met, the tax as applied to petroleum reverted to a
general income source.

Arguments have been flying back and forth over the amount of the tax to
be applied to gas and electricity (EER 444/9), one factor which has
delayed extension of the levy to energy sources beyond petroleum.

In addition to Staribacher's resignation, federal chancellor Franz
Vranitzky is faced with the challenge of forming a new government
following elections last month. That factor, plus the ministerial
change, as well as renewed debate over the size of the tax and its
utilisation - restricted or general - will probably postpone any
possible introduction of the levy until after mid-year at the earliest.

NESTE SELLS SOVEREIGN INTEREST TO UK REC NORTHERN ELECTRIC

Neste Corporation, the state-owned Finnish oil and gas company, has
signed a letter of intent to sell its 50.5% stake in Sovereign
Exploration to Northgas, a subsidiary of the UK regional power
distributor Northern Electric, Neste confirmed.

In February 1994, Neste and Northern Electric formed an upstream gas
company based on Neste's Southern Gas Basin interests and including the
Victor Gas field. As well as Victor, Sovereign Exploration also holds
interests in the Schooner field, which is scheduled to start production
at the end of 1996.

The sale of Sovereign Exploration marks Neste's latest phase in
divesting non-essential oil production and exploration holdings. The
company had earlier sold its UK oil assets to Sweden's Sands Petroleum
in a deal worth FM899m ($207m), as well as its oil and gas exploration
interests in the US.

Instead, Neste intends to re-focus on its upstream activities on the
Norwegian continental shelf, according to Neste's E&P planning manager,
Jyrki Haapio.

"We will also concentrate on upstream activities in the Middle East and
Russia," said Haapio. "This re-focusing of operations will result in
Neste moving its international business unit, responsible for our
Middle East operations, from London to Dubai."

STATOIL PLANS 1996 OUTPUT BOOST

Norwegian state-owned oil company Statoil expects to produce an
estimated 480mbbl of oil in 1996, the company's in-house magazine
Weekly Status said. Statoil produced 448mbbl in 1995, down from 460mbbl
in 1994.

This year's expected increase was attributed to the Heidrun and Yme
fields. Heidrun is now pumping at capacity and Yme will begin
production in a few weeks, the magazine said. Heidrun produced
218,491bbl on 1 January, thus achieving the goal of 200,000bbl/d at
year-end by a wide margin, Statoil added.

But the publication said an increase in production at Statfjord
satellites and the start of output at Heidrun in 1995 was not enough to
offset a considerable decrease at the old, giant Statfjord and Gullfaks
fields. It said production at Statfjord and Gullfaks would continue to
fall in 1996.

Norway, which pumped more than 3mbbl/d in November, is second only to
Saudi Arabia in the world's league of oil exporters.

* Norwegian oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) production hit a new
record in November, according to analysts Wood Mackenzie. Output
averaged 3.19mbbl/d, 1,000bbl/d higher than the average level produced
in October, Wood Mackenzie said.

"Output from Heidrun continued to come onstream averaging 87,000bbl/d
for the month and production from Troll oil increased to 187,000bbl/d,"
said Wood Mackenzie in its December report on North West Europe. But
production from the Snorre, Gullfaks and Statfjord fields, loaded
offshore, fell slightly.

Danish oil and NGL production, meanwhile, fell by 4% to 182,000bbl/d in
November due to lower output from the Gorm and Skjold fields, said Wood
Mackenzie. Dutch oil and NGL output rose to 45,000bbl/d during
November, up almost 10% from October's 41,000bbl/d.

STATOIL REPORTS MAJOR FIND

Norwegian oil company Statoil appears to have made the biggest oil
strike in the Danish North Sea sector since the Skjold field was
discovered in 1977.

Preliminary reports indicate that the Siri-1 field, which lies only 6km
from the border with the Norwegian sector, contains as much as 150mbbl
of oil - sufficient to meet Denmark's oil requirements for three years.
The find is worth an estimated DKr15bn ($2.7bn).

Statoil reckons production at Siri-1 can start as early as 1998 because
the oil is in comparatively easily accessible strata. The find was made
2,200 metres underground in an area where the sea depth is 60 metres.

Denmark's energy minister Svend Auken expressed satisfaction that the
find was made so quickly after the recent granting of new exploration
rights in the fourth Danish round of concessions.

The interests in the fourth round licence in which the find was made
(6/95) are as follows: Statoil (operator) 50%, Enterprise Oil 20%, Dong
20% and Denerco 10%.

RECORD OUTPUT PREDICTION

UK North Sea oil figures due for release this month are expected to
reveal record output levels, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland
Oil and Gas Index. Analyst Mark Shea said figures for November and
December last year were expected to show peak production.

He said oil output for November was likely to have equalled or beat the
previous peak of 2.82mbbl/d recorded in January 1985. But figures for
December were expected to be even higher.

Shea went on: "We are expecting this peak because we know which oil
fields have come on stream and what production levels are likely to be.
However, we cannot guarantee peak output will be achieved."

Shea said the increasing production was down to a number of major
factors, such as advancing technology and cost-cutting by the oil
companies. "We are now seeing fields producing oil long after they were
forecast to run dry . . . These figures, despite the current low price
of oil, highlight how healthy the industry is and how important UK
investment is to the rest of the world."

SPAIN PLANS $200M REFINERY PIPELINE LINK BY 1997

A Pta25bn ($203m) oil pipeline will link Repsol's Puertollano and
Cartagena refineries in 1997, the industry and energy ministry said
last December.

Puertollano, in the central Spanish province of Ciudad Real, is the
only refinery in Spain not situated at a port and is the best placed to
meet rising demand for oil products in central Spain.

The 350km link will improve supplies of crude oil to the refinery, and
lead to an increase in capacity from 7mt/yr to 7.5mt/yr. The project
will receive Pta10bn ($81m) from the EU under the European Regional
Development Fund programme.

The port of Escombreras, Cartagena, is currently undergoing work which
will allow it to admit 125,000cm capacity tankers initially intended to
allow greater entry of liquefied natural gas to the Cartagena
regasification plant. The link to Puertollano opens up greater
possibilities for Cartagena as a point of entry for crude oil.

* The Banco Bilbao Vicaya (BBV) has increased its interest in Repsol
from 4.5% to 5.13% to gain fiscal advantages offered to groups
controlling a more than Pta60bn of share capital in another. The move
takes BBV ahead of Pemex (4.99%) as number two institutional Repsol
shareholder behind the Spanish state (21%). Madrid is expected to sell
around 7% of Repsol before the upcoming March general election.

CEPSA SET TO BEAT SALES RECORD

Cepsa, Spain's largest private oil refiner, is expected to surpass the
Pta1bn ($8m) sales mark for 1995. Up to November, the company reported
consolidated sales of Pta960bn, and gross profits of Pta29.18bn, 19.9%
up on the same period for 1994.

Stronger domestic oil product sales, up to 17.2mt (0.6% up) and
improved refinery margins gave added impetus to a strong chemicals
performance registered earlier in the year.

The company invested Pta46bn over the first 11 months of 1995, with the
main priority being the company's RKF and ORD blocks in the Algerian
Sahara. The company expects the first of these to produce 12,000bbl/d
later this year, rising to 30,000bbl/d by the start of 1997.

Cepsa has countered speculation in local press reports of 600mbbl of

before it can comment on volumes.

ESSO SAYS IT WILL STOP LEADED PETROL MARKETING THIS YEAR

By mid-1996 demand for high-grade leaded petrol should be so low in
Germany that Esso will stop marketing it. The warning came as Esso
unveiled plans to rationalise its retail petrol network.

According to Herbert Kirchhoff, head of the oil company's filling
station business, the share of leaded super in total petrol sales fell
to 6% last year, from more than 30% as recently as 1990. In 1996 it
will reach only 2.5%, Esso says.

Kirchhoff estimates that 5% of all cars registered in Germany - just
under 2m vehicles - are still in the market for leaded super. To offer
them an alternative, Esso - like its competitor Shell - has launched an
erosion protection additive which must be added to each tankful of
unleaded. Some 70 Esso filling stations are already no longer selling
leaded super.

Meanwhile, the concentration process in the filling station business
has continued unabated in Germany. In the 25 years to 1994, the total
number of filling stations plummeted by 60% - from 44,600 in the former
West Germany to 18,300 in unified Germany, 2,000 of which are located
in the east.

In the case of Esso this means that it cut the number of its own
stations from 5,560 to 1,627. Thanks to the restructuring, average
petrol and diesel sales per station jumped - from 470,000 litre/yr to
2.5m litres/yr.

With an 8% share in the German filling station market, Esso accounts
for 12% in total motor fuel sales. The company points out that with
3.6m litres/yr per station, Esso's own sales exceed the average annual
figure by one-third, giving a turnover of DM7m/yr ($4.9m/yr) per unit.

Due to estimated investments of DM400,000 per station in additional
environmental protection measures needed to comply with new
legislation, the total number of filling stations in Germany is bound
to shrink further.

Esso's own plans foresee the closure of about 250 stations, with the
construction of 50 new ones, predominantly in east Germany, also
envisaged. This would leave the total number of Esso stations at around
1,400, with 150 of them in eastern Germany.

In its survey of German energy consumption in the past year, Esso
points out that the German refineries are once again losing money. It
complains that while crude imports into Germany in 1995 dropped by 4%
to 101.9mt, oil product imports rose by the same percentage rate to
42.8mt. As a result, average refinery utilisation dropped to 92.2% from
95.5% in 1994.

Combined with high German production costs, this led to losses in the
downstream sector, surpassing those recorded a year earlier. Thus, two
refineries closed down last year. Consequently, overall distillation
capacity dropped to 111.9mt/yr from 113.1mt/yr in 1994. At the same
time, the sector invested in additional conversion capacity at the
remaining refineries which led to an increase of 2% to 47.5mt/yr.

With deliveries of 20.7mt, the CIS was Germany's largest supplier of
crude last year, despite the fact that the volume was down 9% on 1994.
A close second was Norway, which upped its crude exports to Germany by
4% to 20.3mt, followed by the UK which raised them by 11% to 18.5mt.

Deliveries from Libya dropped 3% to 11.4mt. As a result, German crude
receipts from the North Sea (38%) surpassed those from OPEC countries
(35%) for the first time.

Sales of oil products in the German market were up 1% to 127.3mt last
year. Petrol consumption rose only 1.7% to 30.3mt, although motor
registration figures showed an increase of 2% to 40.7m vehicles. Sales
of unleaded jumped by 1mt to 28.6mt.

Thanks to the ongoing construction activity in east Germany, and
Germany's increasing role as a transit country, demand for diesel
expanded by 4.1% to 26.6mt. By contrast, demand for LFO continued to
fall, despite lower temperatures at end-1995 compared to a year
earlier: sales dropped 2.8% to 35mt.

Against that, HFO sales rose 2% to 7.7mt, thus registering growth for
the first time in two years. However, Esso does not see any expansion
potential in this line in the long run, due to ever stricter
environmental provisions.

IPIC IN OMV SHAREHOLDER SPAT

Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC), a 19.6%
shareholder in OMV, and the government's holding corporation OIAG, are
sparring over possible changes to OMV's shareholder base.

OIAG is seeking to sell off at least 24 percentage points of its
present 49% OMV stake; unless IPIC boosts its holding, an OIAG sell-off
could trigger clauses in the syndicate agreement running to 2010 under
which Abu Dhabi bought into OMV in 1994 (EER 412/5). The agreement
guarantees government buyback of the IPIC holding should OIAG's share
fall below 30.1%.

OIAG to date has failed to convince IPIC to boost its holding to a
controlling 25.1%. At the same time, the Austrian group has failed to
agree to an IPIC representative on the OMV board; the syndicate
contract called for two board seats.

An alternative further privatisation via public sale on the Vienna
stock exchange has been discounted by OIAG due to the depressed market.

Difficulties on the IPIC-OIAG shareholder level notwithstanding, OMV
has hopes of winning an opportunity to participate in a $1bn
polyethylene plant to be built in Abu Dhabi. The emirate expects
Western investors to take up 35% of the project.

OMV is experienced in polyethylene production through its plastics
subsidiary and rates its chances in Abu Dhabi "at over 50%", according
to OMV general director Richard Schenz.

HELSINKI TRIGGERS PROTESTS WITH REMOVAL OF PRICE SUBSIDY

Finland's largest industrial users of Russian-sourced natural gas are
lobbying Neste to maintain prices at 1995 rates this year. The action
follows the Finnish government move, on 1 January, to discontinue the
provision of subsidies aimed at increasing the competitiveness of gas
imported from Russia, and which was worth around FM20m/yr ($4m/yr).

The removal of the state gas subsidy, triggered by the ongoing
harmonisation of Finnish economic provisions with EU measures, caused
an automatic rise in the price of natural gas.

With industrial companies opposed to paying the extra charges, Neste is
being asked to absorb the cost differential left over following the
expiry of the subsidy. The state company has refused to take on the
added cost.

The industrial protest group is headed by forest companies Enso,
Ahlstrom, Kymmene and the power distribution company Etela Suomen
Voima. Gas supplies are handled by Gasum, the joint venture company 75%-
owned by Neste and 25% by Russia's Gazprom. Finland imported Russian
gas worth FM1.3bn in 1994.

The dispute is currently in arbitration and could yet end up in the
country's marketing court. Obstructing the way to a solution is a 10-
year price and supply contract, signed in 1990 and not due to expire
until the end of the decade.

Industrial companies claim that this contract constrains Gasum to
adhere to a set price strategy over the 10-year period to 1999. Gasum
argues that the 1990 contract did not take into account Finland's
membership of the EU in 1994, which was regarded as a remote
possibility when the contract was signed.

TRANSGAS CANDIDATES MULTIPLY

British Petroleum Portuguesa and Petrogal, Portugal's state-controlled
oil company, have added their names to the list of international energy
companies interested in buying a stake in Transgas, Portugal's natural
gas utility, when it is privatised in a process expected to begin in
1996.

Petrogal's interest in the acquisition of a holding has reportedly been
welcomed by Jose Penedos, the secretary of state for energy in the new
Socialist government.

Penedos has said that the previous government's plans to sell a
dominant stake in Transgas to a strategic partner are being
reconsidered.

COMPLAINTS OVER 'HIGH' PRICES

German industry pays more for its gas purchases than industry in any
other EU country other than Portugal, according to the VEA association
representing the interests of industrial energy consumers.

According to Eurostat figures for January 1995, the average price of
gas in the EU is 22% lower than average prices in Germany if Portugal,
which currently uses only town gas at very high prices, is left out of
the picture. Industrial customers in the UK pay the lowest prices,
followed by Spain, France and Luxembourg.

This regrettable state of affairs lays a heavy burden on German
industry, says the VEA. Countless jobs have been shifted abroad on
grounds of cost, and if something is not done about reducing the price
of energy to industry, "further considerable damage will be done to the
domestic industrial sector".

The VEA puts the blame on lack of competition in Germany. The
demarcation and concession contracts which give the gas companies their
own monopoly supply areas must be abolished, it demands. At the same
time, the VEA stressed its support for the so-far unsuccessful
proposals for a liberalisation of the energy markets made initially by
the federal economic affairs ministry some two years ago.

EVN SUCCESS IN HUNGARY

Among Austrian bidders for a share in Hungary's gas privatisation (EER
449/12), only regional utility EVN managed a successful offer.

Jointly with Germany's Bayernwerk, EVN now holds 50% plus one share in
Koegaz, a regional gas utility serving about 190,000 customers in a
southwestern region encircling Lake Balaton and extending to the
Slovenian and Croatian borders. The consortium joint investment amounts
to $67m, up $20m from its first bid.

EVN will have few immediate gains from the deal; the service territory
does not border on Austria, as would have been the case had EVN gained
a hold in other Hungarian gas utilities for which it had bid.

Nevertheless, EVN's success is unlikely to induce much pleasure with
Austria's state-controlled gas monopoly, OMV, which failed in its
Hungarian bids.

EVN's deal further strengthens its ties with the German utility, with
which it shares major stakes in Austria's private gas and oil producer
RAG. OMV and the 51% state-owned electricity authority Verbund have
felt themselves threatened by Bayernwerk, which has made offers on
several Austrian privatisations.

DRAFT DOMESTIC LICENCE DETAILS

The deregulation of the UK's domestic gas market was set to draw a few
concrete steps nearer as EER went to press with the government expected
to publish the requirements it will impose on interested companies
within days.

With the first, limited stage of the liberalisation to take place in
the West Country from April, the department of trade and industry was
to publish draft proposals for gas supply and shipper licences.

Parties interested in competing with British Gas (BG) in the 18m
residential consumer market will require a supply licence, while those
that want to transport gas through BG's pipeline grid will also need a
shipper's licence.

The eagerly anticipated licences were expected to offer an insight into
the type of liberalised market the government has in its sights.

GERMAN IMPORTERS PREDICT 10% SLUMP IN 1996 SALES

The German coal importers federation says it expects coal sales to
suffer a decline of 10% in 1996.

Purchases of fresh coal are expected to be postponed as major consumers
use up the "comfortable" coal stocks which were accumulated during the
'Jahrhundert' contract, which expired at the end of 1995. Sales of both
German and imported coal are expected to be affected to the same
degree.

It is all the more ironic that import coal prices will probably remain
at their current low level during 1996, assuming no significant shifts
in currency rates take place - "proof of the continuing value for money
of imported coal", stresses the importers' association.

In the first 10 months of 1995, imported steam coal prices averaged
DM76/t ($53/t) hard coal equivalent (hce), while German steam coal cost
virtually four times as much at DM291/t hce before subsidies took
effect.

CDF STRIKE SETTLED QUICKLY

A strike by miners at the Charbonnages de France (CdF) subsidiary
Houilleres du Bassin de Lorraine ended quickly after miners obtained
concessions, notably an increase in wages. The minimum salary for 1995
was increased from FFr81,000 gross for the whole year to FFr85,000
($17,125), with a bonus of FFr550 per man offered before the end of the
year.

Earlier, some 4,000 miners had clashed with CRS riot police in front of
the company's offices at Freyming-Merlebach (in the Moselle
department). The miners, armed with pick-axe handles, bolts, and hoses,
confronted some 200 CRS officers, and 500 mobile gendarmes. Some 50
persons were injured, of whom two seriously.

Workers at three of the four mines belonging to the company - Reumaux,
Simon and Wouters - went back immediately after the offer. But the
Houve mine at Merlebach held out a little longer, the local branch of
the CGT union not wishing to give the impression of giving in to the
management too quickly.

RWE VOWS TO FIGHT ON TO BRING MUELHEIM-KAERLICH BACK ON LINE

RWE Energie, the operator of the 1,300 MW Muelheim-Kaerlich nuclear
power station off-line since 1988, is adamant that it will continue the
legal battle to bring the reactor back on stream (EER 448/17).

The dispute has already turned into the longest and most costly battle
through the courts in the history of German jurisprudence, according to
Klaudia Martini, head of the environment department in Rhineland-
Palatinate where the reactor is located.

The energy concern announced that it has decided to appeal to the
federal administrative court. This is in defiance of a recent verdict
from the superior district court in Koblenz finding that the first
partial construction licence for the unit, overhauled in  1990, was
invalid and that there was no appeal against this ruling.

But RWE Energie claims that the oral verdict contained a faulty legal
evaluation and that therefore an appeal was justified. Furthermore, a
damage claim filed by RWE - which might amount to half the reactor
construction costs of DM7.8bn ($5.4bn) - is still pending with the
federal supreme court.

Martini has, meanwhile, suggested to RWE that it re-equip Muelheim-
Kaerlich for electricity generation from another primary energy source.
At the same time, she turned down a motion for the opening of formal
reactor closure proceedings, tabled by the Greens in the state
parliament.

Martini argued that such a step would open a can of worms, with RWE
bound to fight every inch of the way for the subsequent partial
construction licences which were all in force. Martini assumed that
this state of affairs would not change, even if RWE were granted an
appeal and tried, for the third time, to get a "new" first licence. It
was now up to RWE "to set a sign of reconciliation in the region by
renouncing a continuation of the legal fight for a first partial
construction licence."

REACTOR SABOTAGED BY SALT

About the time of the first moves by French trade unions to defend
their concept of public service in early December, employees at the
Blayais nuclear power station at Braud-et-St-Louis, in the Gironde
department, were suspected of putting sodium chloride (table salt) into
the secondary cooling circuit of the plant's number three unit.

According to the director of the power station, Martine Griffon-Fouco,
the act could only have been committed by someone with clearance for
access to the site. The management asked the local police to
investigate.

The salt did not present any great danger to the plant, but could, in
due course, have damaged the cooling circuit. Furthermore, there were a
number of other incidents in preceding days, such as unexpected turbine
stoppages. These various incidents were described as "malicious acts",
some way short of sabotage.

NORDIC MARKET BEGINS TRADING

The world's first market in international power trade began operations
on 2 January with Norwegian and Swedish players trading electricity for
NKr28m ($4.4m), officials said.

"Volume was relatively good," said a spokesman for Statnett Marked,
Norway's domestic electricity bourse company. "A gradual escalation is
expected." The joint power pool is based on the same floor as the
Norwegian domestic electricity market, which started regular trading
last spring.

The spokesman said 180 GWh were traded, including 160 GWh by telephone
and 20 GWh by telefax. This compared to 85 GWh on 29 December, before
Swedish traders entered the market, but dealers attributed the rise to
the prevailing cold spell.

Norway and Sweden removed border tariffs on electricity from 1 January,
allowing producers and consumers to trade power freely between the
neighbouring states. The jointly owned wholesale power pool is seen as
a starting point for a much wider market encompassing Finland and
Denmark.

In 1994, Statnett traded 25% of total Norwegian electricity
consumption, amounting to NKr5bn in turnover. This year trade is
expected to total one-third of consumption.

The exchange offers a day ahead, or physical, market, and a weekly or
futures market.

Meanwhile, against the backdrop of the liberalisation of Sweden's
electricity market, Finnish state energy company Imatran Voima (IVO)
signed an electricity supply agreement with Sweden's TelgeKraft worth
FM348m ($80m).

The contract covers the supply of 300 GWh over the three-year period
1996-1998, with first deliveries scheduled to begin as soon as 24
January.

"The agreement with IVO is significant, and was based on an open
competition where the best price pitched won," said TelgeKraft's CEO
Kjell Hasslert.

Under the agreement, IVO is contracted to supply electricity produced
using renewable energy resources "whenever feasible". This portion of
the contract will require IVO to source power supplied to TelgeKraft
from hydro and biofuel-fired power plants.

Founded in 1993, TelgeKraft is controlled by some of Sweden's largest
industrial groups, including Ericsson, Telge Energi, Scania and Astra.
The company concentrates on the purchase and distribution of energy to
its shareholders, and is forecast to purchase 1.5 TWh of electricity
from Nordic suppliers in 1996.

DISTRIBUTION CONTRACTS DISPUTED

Belgian power utility Electrabel has defended its ongoing negotiations
for 18-year distribution contracts with local authorities, saying they
are needed to ensure long-term investments and are to the benefit of
consumers.

Freddy Willockx, a Belgian Socialist member of the European parliament,
has claimed Electrabel's efforts to tie part-local authority-owned
companies to 18-year distribution contracts threaten EU liberalisation.

Electrabel restarted talks with local authorities in November over the
18-year contracts, which would be made in exchange for the authorities
taking 5% stakes in Electrabel production units, Willockx said.

An Electrabel spokesman said: "The European Commission is interested in
the interests of consumers, and a free and open market is not the
bible. The most important aspect is the interest of the consumer."

"We pledge ourselves to have investments with municipalities in inter-
municipal distribution companies," the spokesman continued, "but we
will not make long-term investments if we are in short-term contracts."
Willockx was "blind to the economics of the investment", the spokesman
added.

The Electrabel spokesman confirmed the contracts are linked to the
municipal authorities buying Electrabel shares, which will take place
during the first half of the year. The 2,577,256 Electrabel shares,
representing about 5% of the company's capital, are currently retained
by holding company Tractebel, although they were acquired by Electrabel
in 1992 as part of an acquisition, he said.

The shares were subsequently transferred to Tractebel, which holds a
substantial stake in Electrabel, to meet demands from the Belgian
banking and finance commission regulator, he said.

Under the transfer agreement, Electrabel will receive any capital gain
or loss made when the shares are sold to the municipalities, which will
be made at a market price, he said. The shares were acquired at a
valuation of BFr5,600 ($188.74), he said.

GEC, CEGELEC BUY AEG ASSETS

French concerns GEC Alsthom and Cegelec, both linked to Alcatel
Alsthom, have signed a preliminary agreement to buy what remains of
Daimler-Benz's electrical business, AEG. The price was not disclosed.

GEC Alsthom is to take over the transmission and distribution (T&D)
businesses of AEG, which should boost its turnover in this field by
some FFr7bn ($1.4bn), bringing it to FFr18.5bn/yr. It will also give
the company coverage of 35 countries against 24 previously, and make it
the largest company in T&D, ahead of ABB and Siemens.

For Cegelec, taking over AEG's industrial process control business will
boost its turnover in Germany to the equivalent of FFr6.5bn from the
current FFr1.4bn (which compares with worldwide turnover of FFr16.4 bn
for the whole of 1994).

In addition, the takeover will give Cegelec a higher profile in Central
Europe, the Americas (north and south), and in South Africa, as well as
some fresh clients in the petroleum industry.

AEG will retain 49% in the holding company that is to be established to
run these businesses, while GEC Alsthom will get 51%. One consequence
of the restructuring that will follow the takeover is likely to be job
losses. In the meantime, however, Daimler-Benz was still negotiating
the possibility of contributing financially to some of the changes.

EVS/BADENWERK HYDRO TAKEOVER

A consortium of seven Baden-Wuerttemberg power suppliers, headed by EVS
and Badenwerk, is to take over Neckar, the utility operating 24 hydro
stations on the river Neckar between Mannheim and Plochingen.

Up to now Neckar has been owned by the federal government (63.5%) and
by the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg (35%), which are parting with their
shares "for financial reasons".

The consortium will pay DM138.3m ($96m) for 99% of the shares. Neckar
generated 582.7 GWhe in 1994. According to EVS, this is twice as much
as it produces itself from hydro power, and equals 3.7% of its total
electricity generation.

EVS' own power sales reached the record level of just under 21 TWh in
1995. This was an increase of 5% against a year earlier. It was due
chiefly, according to chairman Wilfried Steuer, to a steep rise in
electricity deliveries abroad - up 33%.

EVS also pitched in and helped temporarily with the tight supply
situation of French power giant Electricity de France (EdF), hit by the
recent strike. At the time, EVS supplied roughly 5 GWh per day.

But it could only generate part of the overall volume itself. For the
rest it depended on purchases from east German supra-regional power
supplier Veag.

However, even without the booming foreign business, EVS sales would
have gone up. Power consumption in its own supply area also rose last
year - by 2.3% against 1994. Due to the flagging economy, Steuer
expects deliveries to EVS' own supply area to increase by 1-2% only in
1996.

HUNGARIAN POWER STAMPEDE

Following VEW and Ruhrgas' successful entry into the Hungarian gas
market - via participations in a regional (DDGAZ) and a municipal
(Foegaz) gas supplier (EER 449/20) - other German energy concerns have
hastened to make sure they will play a role in Hungary's electricity
privatisation.

RWE and its junior partner, southern German regional concern EVS,
bought 46.15% of Elmu, a distributor serving the greater Budapest area
with sales of 7.8 TWh/yr, and 48.8% of Emasz, serving the northeast
with sales of 4.7 TWh/yr.

The grouping also acquired a 38% stake in brown coal producer Matra,
consisting of an 800 MW power station and two opencast mines. The group
was granted the option to increase its stakes in all companies to 50%
and one share by end-1997. It is planning to invest around DM1bn
($693m), chiefly in Matra, over the next few years.

Bayernwerk won a majority stake in southwestern supplier Dedasz (sales
of 3.6 TWh/yr), while upper-Bavarian regional utility Isar-Amperwerke -
which Bayernwerk is striving to take over - acquired 49.23% of eastern
Hungarian supplier Titasz (sales 3.1 TWh/yr), together with the option
to raise its stake to 50.1% by end-1997.

RAINS BREAK HYDRO DECLINE

Spain's plunging hydroelectric production spiral finally bottomed out
in November last year after significant rainfall broke the drought.

According to figures published in December by Spain's network company,
Red Electrica de Espana (REE), the sector registered a fresh record
minimum for daily generating output before mid-month rainfall led to
the first notable production lift since March last year.

Rains in the second week boosted the daily producible power figure to
154 GW for 16 November, the first time this figure had overcome the 150
GW mark since the first week in March 1995. This improvement came just
over two weeks after REE reported the new record output low at 13 GW on
1 November. This was 2.27 GW lower than the previous minimum set on 22
October 1995.

Six months of announcing successive record-breaking lows for the
contents of Spain's hydro generating reservoirs also ended in November
when REE said the water level nationwide had edged above the line
marking the previous November minimum, reaching 26.9% of their total
capacity.

This is the first time for six months that the water level in
reservoirs has not set a fresh monthly minimum record, having plummeted
since the end of January 1995.

The gap between the median figure and the real amount of collected
water has been widening steadily since February 1994. Indeed, over the
last three years, the real figure has been higher than the median for
only six months; this was in one single spell from September 1993 to
February 1994.

The disparity in reserves is echoed in REE's production figures for the
month of November as a whole: the 1. 255 TWh hydro-generated in
November 1995 was vastly lower than in the corresponding months of 1994
and 1993 - 42.7% and 62.9% less respectively.

While total production for the month, including all power producing
sources except autoproducers, was 3.7% up, coal and nuclear-generated
power made up the difference increasing output by 19.8% to 6. 97 TWh
and 7.5% to 4.65 TWh respectively.

The 12.571 TWh total November demand took the figure for the first
eleven months to 138.339 TWh, 3.9% higher than the same period in 1994.

Even heavy rainfall in December is unlikely to lift the total hydro
generation figure for 1995 any higher than the third worst hydro
performance in the last 25 years. The output total to the end of
November in Spain reached 19. 583 TWh, already more than Unesa's two
lowest readings, 19.511 TWh in 1992 and 18.671 TWh in 1989.

Meanwhile, Portugal's five years of drought also appear to be over,
according to meteorological officials, heralding a period of increased
hydroelectric production.

Rainfall in the southern Alentejo region, the area worst hit by
drought, was greater in November and December than in the previous four
years and several regions of Portugal continue to risk flooding.
Agriculture accounts for more than 75% of all water consumption in
Portugal, compared with 14% for industry and 7% for domestic
consumption.

* Strike action in France led to strong power exports from Spain to
France in November 1995, peaking at hourly readings of 1.3 GWh in the
last days of the month, said REE. While Spain's power relationship with
Electricite de France (EdF) is hugely weighted in favour of imports,
43.65 GWh went to France in November, 72% more than in October.
November power imports from France totalled 439.25 GWh. REE signed a
"support agreement" with EdF on 1 November which caps Spanish power
exports at 200 GWh, equivalent, said REE, to 400 hours at a maximum of
500 MW. The agreement covers the period November 1995 to March 1996.

MADRID IMPOSES TARIFF SQUEEZE

Madrid has taken measures to rein in Spain's power sector profits for
1996, freezing tariffs for the first time since 1973 and introducing
tougher controls on sector income.

Acting on advice from the national electricity systems commission
(CSEN), the industry and energy ministry said the moves passed on the
benefits of economic recovery and technological advances to the
consumer.

Between Christmas and New Year, the treasury's superior pricing board
accepted the ministry's recommendation for an average "zero increase"
in electricity charges, justified by estimates of a 3.5-4% demand lift
throughout the year.

This level of confidence foresees a return to the degree of sustained
growth last witnessed during the mid-1980s. The "zero increase" is to
be applied to across the board to all tariff scales; domestic,
industrial and the large-scale industry rate. Last year, tariff scale
alterations produced an average 1.48% increase, well below inflation at
4.3%.

The decision to freeze tariffs followed approval by Madrid's commission
for economic affairs of a revised legal framework reducing recognised
costs borne by the sector by Pta29bn ($236m), 1.42% of the total 1995
tariff.

These alterations would appear to signal an end to the long-running
debate between the CSEN, the major utilities and the industrial
grouping which represents their interests, Unesa (EER 448/19).

Of the seven alterations to the recognised costs borne by the sector,
only two went in favour of the utilities. Worth a total Pta10.28bn,
these are increased allowance for costs brought about by the ongoing
drought, and by the enforced changes to billing methods.

The new arrangements for adjusting the effects of the drought,
calculated in terms of replacing 'lost' hydro-generated power by
increased fossil fuel firing, recognised Pta9.58bn in costs.

The remaining Pta702m will pay for a new billing structure intended to
show consumers how much of their electricity bill will go toward paying
off Pta730bn over 25 years to cover assets lost in the now-permanent
nuclear moratorium, as well as funds that subsidise the coal industry.
These percentages, 3.54% of the bill for nuclear debt pay-off and 5%
for the coal industry, will remain the same in 1996.

The five considerations on the minus side for the utilities subtract
Pta39.39bn from recognised costs: this includes some Pta4.159bn less in
the allowance to pay off generating assets; a reduction of 2-3
percentage points below the retail price index from operating and
generating costs reflecting improved efficiency, totalling Pta10.24bn
next year; some Pta23bn deducted from 'structural' costs; and a further
Pta2bn off as the first step in removing the subsidy for the utilities'
"employee electricity rate" from the tariff.

This is the first time Spanish consumers will not subsidise the
employee rate, a next-to-nothing Pta0.15/kWh, which has remained
unchanged since it was introduced in 1944 when the domestic rate was
Pta0.45/kWh.

Some 66,000 power sector directors and employees, including retired
staff, benefited from this rate last year. The CSEN recommended
employees lose this perk on a gradual scale up to 2001.

ENDESA'S LATIN AMERICA SPREE

Endesa, Spain's 65%-state owned utility, announced Pta35bn ($285m) of
investment in Latin America at the end of December: Pta15bn in Peru and
Pta20bn in Argentina.

Through its 72.5% interest in the Peruvian company Generalima, the
company won 60% control of Eetvensa, proprietor of the 200 MW
Ventanilla power station, close to the city of Lima. Endesa beat off a
competitive bid from American Energy Systems. The remaining 40% of
Etevensa remains in state hands.

Endesa will be responsible, through Generalima, for adding another 100
MW of generating capacity, installing two gas-fired turbines. The
utility also secured a 30% interest in the Lima and Chancay
distribution company, Distrilima, which has 650,000 customers.

In Argentina, Endesa paid some Pta20bn for 19.46% of the Buenos Aires
distribution company, Edenor, lifting its share to 36.46%. Edenor
distributes half of the power sold in the Buenos Aires region.

Also in December, Iberdrola, Spain's biggest private power utility,
bought 100% of two Bolivian distribution companies, La Paz and Oruro,
from Compania Boliviana de Energia Electrica and Bolivian Power Systems
respectively. The investment cost Iberdrola Pta6bn all told, and gives
the Spanish company control of 45% of Bolivia's power distribution
market.

This is the first Iberdrola move outside Spain as a majority
shareholder. It also has a 20% interest in the 250 MW Guemes power
station project and 26% of the Gas Litoral distribution company (both
Argentina).

NO NEW CAPACITY BEFORE 2000

Madrid has said no new power stations will be commissioned up to the
year 2000. The industry and energy ministry has calculated that none of
the potential demand scenarios make additional generating installations
necessary.

Instead, the ministry introduced changes to the current national energy
plan (PEN) for 1991-2000. Chief among these are move to angle
generating policy toward substituting fuel oil as a generating input
with natural gas and biofuels, lengthen the life of existing power
stations, boost renewable energy funding and promote energy saving
initiatives.

The first step toward the achievement of these objectives was the
promise of a January invitation to tender for contracts to convert
1,400 MW of current fuel oil-fired generating capacity to natural gas-
firing. This represents 18.1% of Spain's existing fuel oil-fired
installed power base.

PORVOO REFINERY POWER PLAN

Neste's board of directors has approved plans by the Neste oil refinery
at Porvoo to invest FM72m ($17m) in 1996 to build two to three 70-110
MW gas-fired power plants, Neste Porvoo's general manager Jouko
Huumonen said.

The plan, which was first proposed in June 1994, would involve the
phased development of on-site power generation capacity to supply oil
and petrochemical refining units at Porvoo.

According to Huumonen, Neste hoped to develop the small station concept
and have plants with a total generating capacity of 500-800 MW on site
by the year 2002. Excess production would be channelled into the
national grid.

POWERGEN'S REFINERY CHP DEAL

PowerGen's CHP division has been awarded a contract to supply the
electricity and steam requirements of Conoco's Humber refinery. The
contract will involve the construction of a new gas-fired CHP unit
rated at 24 MWe and over 90 MWth.

The #23m ($35m) plant will feature four independent gas turbines with
back-up systems to ensure continuous running even when the primary gas
supply is unavailable.

To coincide with the plant construction, a connection between the
refinery and the existing Theddlethorpe-Killingholme gas line will be
installed by Kinetica, the PowerGen/Conoco joint venture.

PowerGen CHP managing director Bob Kennett claimed, "We have broken new
ground in meeting the requirements of Conoco for efficient but flexible
plant. Both parties can be confident that the energy supply will
support the refinery's demands in future."

OFFER AMENDS REC LICENCES

UK electricity regulator Stephen Littlechild has published proposals to
modify the licences of regional electricity companies (RECs) SWEB and
Eastern Group following their recent takeovers.

The modifications deal with financial ring-fencing of the electricity
businesses, restrictions on activities, availability of resources,
disposal of assets, and provision of information to Offer. They have
already been agreed by Southern Electric International, now the
majority shareholder in SWEB, and Hanson, the majority shareholder in
Eastern Group, and will be applied to other merged companies in due
course.

Littlechild explained that the "licence modifications will allow me to
continue to regulate effectively and to ensure that customers continue
to be fully  protected."

STEEL AUTOPRODUCER BUYOUT

Electricite de France (EdF) and Edison have completed the purchase of
75% of the independent Italian electricity producer Ilva Servizi
Energie (ISE) for a total of L370bn ($232m).

The deal was initially agreed at the beginning of 1995, but was subject
to conditions which were not met until towards the end of last year.
The purchase was made through a joint company called Finel, in which
Italian firm Edison has 60% and EdF 40%.

ISE is building a 500 MW thermal power station at Taranto (in Puglia),
which will be fired with gases from the blast furnaces of the local
steelworks. It will use combined cycle technology to generate both
electricity, which will be sold to state power utility Enel, and steam,
which will be used by the steelworks.

The project is due to come into operation in the second half of 1996.
ISE already has overall capacity of some 600 MW, including a thermal
power station at Taranto, two at Piombino (in Tuscany), and a hydro
power plant at Terni (in Umbria).

EdF commented that it viewed this as an important step in developing
collaborations with other power generators in countries which wanted to
encourage independent electricity producers.

HEALTHY YEAR FOR VERBUND

A 3% increase in total electricity consumption as well as high water
flows through hydro generating plants have assured a good year in 1995
for Austria's Verbund. At the same time, the federal electricity board
has noted the impact of two major cogeneration plants which have come
on stream, trimming industrial electricity usage.

No specific figures have as yet been released, but the Verbund notes an
export surplus in its electricity trading for 1995. Higher exports to
Germany, Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary have been registered, although
these in part have been achieved at below-cost prices in order to work
down growing coal stockpiles (EER 449/13).

On the financial side, the Verbund experienced costs of some Sch400-
500m last year when its long-term borrowings in Swiss francs had to be
revalued to reflect exchange rate differences. About a fifth of Verbund
bonds are denominated in francs.

TARIFF RULING TO STAY IN PLACE

The Swiss federal government will maintain its SFr0.16/kWh ($0.14/kWh)
tariff recommendations for autoproducers, which were due to end on 31
December, for a further three years. The move follows an official
evaluation report, which also urges that autoproducers be better
informed about the federal recommendations and legal situation.

After the two and a half years that the federal tariff recommendations
have been in force, the situation is that the recommendations are
applied "almost entirely" by electricity companies in less than a third
of Swiss cantons (eight).

They are followed only in part in nine cantons, while five other
cantons refused to provide any information for the evaluation, and the
recommendations are entirely ignored in the principal hydro cantons of
Graubuenden, Ticino and Valais, where the difference between the
production cost of about SFr0.04/kWh and the SFr0.16/kWh recommended
for autoproducers is simply considered too great.

The authors of the evaluation report note that while the promotion of
decentralised energy production is an objective for the country as a
whole, this does not justify forcing the three hydro cantons to accept
conditions which would immediately result in local tariff increases.

Martin Renggli, who heads the Federal Energy Office (FEO)'s energy
policy service, told EER that the SKr0.16/kWh average tariff paid to
autoproducers who use renewable energy sources is the equivalent of the
long-term marginal cost. "Switzerland is virtually the only country to
apply such a tariff, which parliament has limited to non-fossil fuel
producers," said Renggli. "The main beneficiaries are small hydro plant
operators, industrial autoproducers being relatively unimportant in our
country".

Since the recommendations took effect, 80% of small hydro plants (less
than 300 kW) surveyed have seen the prices paid for their energy rise
and profitability improve.

* Switzerland's ombudsman has secured an agreement with five major
regional electric companies for a freeze of tariffs for the next three
years. The five companies are BKW, NOK, Atel, CKW and EOS. Announcing
the agreement, the ombudsman's office in Berne said it was made
possible by the regional utilities' "good, and in some cases very good,
1994 results".

SWITZERLAND ORDERS REDUCTION IN CAR FUEL CONSUMPTION

A new federal ordinance aimed at reducing the specific fuel consumption
of automobiles came into force in Switzerland on 1 January, despite
objections by Swiss car importers. The new ruling is designed to reduce
the average specific consumption, in litres per 100km, of all newly
licensed automobiles by a total of 15% within five years (1996-2001).

The ordinance is designed to make it easier to achieve the objectives
of the federal Energy 2000 programme, and in particular to reduce CO2
emissions attributable to automobiles.

"This reduction rate (of 3% per annum) is technically possible,
economically sustainable, and essential from the standpoint of both
energy and environmental policy," according to a statement by the
Federal Energy Office (FEO).

The FEO points out that automobiles which consume less than 5 litres
per 100km are already available on the market and manufacturers are
already engaged in a process of further improving energy efficiency.
German manufacturers have already announced plans to market 3
litre/100km cars by the year 2000, the FEO notes.

The ordinance makes it mandatory, in particular for car importers whose
role is especially important in Switzerland, to do everything possible
over the next five years to achieve the new "average consumption
threshold values", and thus to contribute to more economic and rational
energy utilisation.

The FEO says this will require a major marketing effort by Swiss
importers, assisted by the federal government. The question of a
special label to distinguish the most energy-efficient cars in the
showroom is currently under consideration.

"This will considerably help the federal Energy 2000 programme,"
according to the FEO. The E2000 objectives include stabilising the
consumption of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions at their 1990 levels by
the year 2000, and thereafter reducing them.

GAS-DRIVEN BUS TRIAL IN BRISTOL

Greener public transport moved one step closer for Bristol when the
UK's first purpose-built gas-powered bus was unveiled by transport
minister, Steven Norris.

The bus, which has been specifically designed to use natural gas,
rather than being converted from diesel power is the result of a five
company partnership - FirstBus Transit Developments, British Gas,
Cummings, Plaxton Coach & Bus and Dennis Specialist Vehicles - and will
be operated by FirstBus.

The spark ignited engine runs off the gas stored in six tanks held in a
specially designed pod on the roof of the bus. The bus will serve the
Temple Meads, city centre, Redland and Clifton areas of Bristol.

Speaking at the launch, Norris said: "Government is aware of public
concern about air quality and the introduction of this new gas bus is
an excellent initiative to help reduce vehicle emissions in an urban
area."

LITTLE CHANGE IN GERMAN INPUTS SEEN BUT CO2 PLANS QUERIED

Primary energy consumption in Germany is expected to remain more or
less constant over the next 25 years, thanks to massive increases in
energy productivity through energy saving and technical progress,
according to a report by Swiss consultants Prognos for the German
federal economic affairs ministry.

The primary energy matrix will only shift marginally during this
period, the report states - the shares of coal, lignite and nuclear
power will shrink, to the benefit mainly of gas, which will increase it
share from 16.8% today to nearly 24% in 2020.

According to the consultancy, oil should maintain its market position,
while renewable energy sources will manage to increase their share from
currently 2.3% to 3.6% by 2020 - low prices for fossil fuels will
prevent a more significant expansion.

CO2 emissions will fall by only around 10.5% by the year 2005 compared
with 1990 levels, with a further drop of just 3% expected by the year
2020.

The drop predicted by Prognos is less than half of the 25% reduction
which the German government has pledged to achieve by the year 2005.
Thus the study casts considerable doubts on the ability of Bonn to make
any real progress on climate protection measures.

Federal environment minister Angel Merkel criticised the Prognos CO2
findings, claiming the effects of new energy and environment policy
measures had been ignored by the Prognos experts.

But the consultants have retaliated sharply, pointing out that all the
significant instruments - such as the new insulation regulations,
amendments to heating boiler regulations, small combustion plant
regulations, support programmes for renewables and voluntary measures
by industry - were indeed taken into account.

Electricity generation in Germany is forecast to continue rising to the
year 2020 by a total of 18% compared with 1992. Gas will play an
increasingly significant role: a net increase in electricity generating
capacity of 13,500 MW will be necessary over the next 25 years, of
which 61% will be gas-fired.

At the moment, installed gas-fired capacity totals 18,750 MW; by 2020
this will have reached 27,000 MW, says Prognos. Some 3,700 MW of new
gas-firing capacity will be constructed in western Germany and 5,100 MW
in eastern Germany, mainly by the new municipal utilities which have
been founded since German unification .

Gross electricity consumption will also rise, by 23% between 1992 and
2020, with consumption in eastern Germany alone expected to rise much
more steeply - by 52%. This reflects the recovery and expansion of
industry now starting to take off after the economic difficulties
experienced following unification.

In western Germany most of the existing power station capacity will
have to be replaced by the year 2020, states Prognos, but the
consultancy finds it impossible to say at this point what the fuel
structure will be.

For example, between 2005 and 2009, nearly 6,500 MW of the total 22,500
MW nuclear capacity will have to be replaced, assuming a plant lifetime
of 30 years, followed by a further 4,800 MW between 2010-2014 and 9,900
MW between 2015-2020.

It is currently an open question whether the plant will be replaced
with nuclear power stations and if so, which options will be chosen,
says the report - for example, extending the lifetime of old plant, or
use of a new reactor type such as the EPR being developed by Siemens
and Framatome.

SPECIAL REPORT - SPANISH GAS

With the arrival of natural gas from North Africa now imminent, EER
assesses Spain's state of readiness.

The $2.6bn Maghreb-Europe pipeline is 160km away from completion,
sources at Spain's Gas Natural told EER at the end of December.

The news provided an end-1995 boost for the company, already buoyant
after the return to service of the Valle de Escombreras regasification
plant (Cartagena, Murcia) and the announcement of plans to increase its
output by a factor of 12.

Even with three regasification plants in operation this year, the
1,376km pipeline, to be operated by the EMPL venture, will be the
leading gateway for natural gas imports to Spain from the second
quarter, providing logistical support for a 24-year, take-or-pay deal
with Algerian state hydrocarbons company, Sonatrach, to import 1,439bn
thermies up to the year 2020.

Two of the four sections which make up the Algeria-Spain link are
complete: the Algerian stretch and the seabed link under the Strait of
Gibraltar. The 48-inch diameter, 520km Algerian section, laid by
Sonatrach, runs from the Hassi R' Mel gas field to the Moroccan border
via the towns of Mecheria and El Aricha.

Two parallel, 22-inch, 46km lines, which will take natural gas under
the Strait of Gibraltar, link Cape Spartel, on the Moroccan coast west
of Tangiers, and Zahara de los Atunes, on the Spanish coastline west of
Tarifa.

Pipeline company ownership

EMPL is 27%-owned by the Spanish company Sagane, in turn 91% controlled
by Madrid and 9% held by Spain's sole natural gas sourcing company,
Enagas. Portugal's Transgas owns the remaining 22% of EMPL.

Between the Algerian and Strait of Gibraltar sections, EMPL has laid
410km of the total 540km projected for the Moroccan stretch of the
pipeline. The 48-inch line will link the Moroccan border city of Ain-
Beni-Mathar to Cape Spartel, the two points in the entire pipeline
where compression stations will be sited.

The section running from Zahara de los Atunes to Cordoba, managed by
the Al Andalus company (70/30 Enagas and Transgas), has so far 240km of
the total 274km, 48-inch pipeline in place. This final section
completes what Madrid's industry and energy terms the "first phase" of
the Maghreb-Europe pipeline. Initial capacity will allow an annual
throughput of 10bncm/yr.

In practice, however, Madrid has put the initial annual volume coming
into Spain at 6bncm/yr, of which 2.5bncm/yr will go to Portugal where,
according to Gas Natural, the 371km pipeline linking Setubal and Braga
is now complete. The relationship between the two Iberian neighbours is
a key element in planned extensions to the regional natural gas
transport network in the northwestern quarter of the peninsular.

Interconnection with Portugal

The Spain-Portugal 'interconnection', as Madrid terms the plan, is
designed to allow both countries to benefit from their respective
geographies. Portugal will receive natural gas from Algeria via the gas
hub in Cordoba. By extending the northern Portuguese network,
meanwhile, Spain will be able to pipe natural gas to Galicia and
Asturias, currently without piped natural gas west of Aviles.

The new Portuguese pipeline will start in Braga going northwards across
the border to Tuy and on to Pontevedra, La Coruna, and Villalba (all
Galicia), terminating in Oviedo.

The "circuit" in western Spain will be completed by adding a pipeline
branching northwards to Asturias through Extremadura and Castilla y
Leon from the $180m trunk line link from Cordoba to Campo Maior close
to Badajoz on the Spain-Portugal border. The Cordoba-Campo Maior
pipeline is the responsibility of the Gasoducto de Extremadura company
(51% Enagas and 49% Transgas) and is made up of 192km of 32-inch
pipeline and 64km of 28-inch pipeline.

The EU's REGEN II Ecu500m finance initiative, aimed at supporting cross-
border gas and electricity links between member states, has agreed to
support the Cordoba-Campo Maior and Braga-Villalba pipeline projects to
the tune of Pta12.72bn ($103m), equal to 40% of the Pta31.8bn total
estimated spend. The Villalba-Oviedo extension is not supported by
REGEN II since it is not a border-related link, but it will receive EU
funding under the European Regional Development Fund.

In the last quarter of 1995, Madrid reaffirmed four key natural gas
infrastructural initiatives, which as part of the current (1991-2000)
national energy plan (PEN) will ensure the arrival of natural gas in
the following regions: Castilla La Mancha, Valencia, Andalucia, Murcia,
Castilla y Leon and Extremadura.

The most significant is a pipeline proposal termed the 'second phase'
of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline. It envisages 36- and 30-inch diameter
pipelines, still under study according to Gas Natural, running 320km
northeastwards from Cordoba, forking at Motilla (Castilla La Mancha
region). One branch is to run 260km northwards to Caspe, Zaragoza
province, and the other, 150km eastwards to Sagunto, on the
Mediterranean coast 30km north of Valencia.

Possible link to France?

The Caspe link is designed to open up possibilities of a connection
through Aragon or Catalonia to France. This second phase of the Maghreb-
Europe pipeline could lead to the pipe doubling its initial throughput
capacity to 20bncm/yr using the two Moroccan compression facilities.
This second phase would involve another major pipeline construction
initiative from Cordoba to northeast Spain capable of transporting
"large quantities (of natural gas) towards northern Europe", the
ministry of industry and energy said.

The other fork at Motilla would take Algerian gas to the 'Mediterranean
Arc' pipeline (Barcelona-Cartagena) at Sagunto. Both Motilla lines
would offer natural gas to areas of Castilla La Mancha, Aragon and
Valencia, currently not connected to the natural gas network.

Until the Maghreb-Europe pipeline comes into service, Spain will
continue to depend on its regasification plants to support national
demand. LNG produced some 77% of the 81.10bn thermies Enagas bought in
1994 and 84% of the 42.77bn acquired in the first half of 1995. The
reopening of the Valle de Escombreras plant at the Mediterranean port
of Cartagena, one of the modifications to the original PEN, brings the
total of regasification facilities in Spain to three, alongside those
at Palos de la Frontera (Huelva) and Barcelona.

Regasification investment

Enagas said it would invest Pta13.2bn in boosting the current
Escombreras output capacity of 50,000cm/h (equivalent to 3.5bn
thermies/yr) to 600,000cm/h in five years. The spend is part of the
regional gas plan for Murcia announced last spring, with  global
investment of Pta38bn. The company is aiming at a target of 50,000
domestic and 100 industrial customers in Murcia by the year 2000.

Enagas has divided the expansion plan into two phases. The first,
scheduled to run up to the middle of 1997 will increase emission
capacity to 150,000cm/hr, at a pressure of 72 bars using the plant's
existing storage capacity. The second phase, with two sub-stages, aims
to build two additional storage facilities holding 105,000cm each and
docking structures capable of receiving 125,000cm LNG tankers by 1998.
Enagas said the plant would reach its the final output goal of
600,000cm/h in 2000.

The opening of both the Cartagena plant and extensions to the
northwestern pipeline network have led the industry and energy ministry
to suspend the original PEN project for a new regasification plant at
the port of El Ferrol (Galicia).

Basques' separate course

Meanwhile, the autonomous Basque government is still reported to be in
negotiations with the US and Japanese gas companies, Enron and
Mitsubishi, on its proposed regasification plant for the port of
Bilbao. The plan, aimed at exclusive supply for the Basque region has
been costed at Pta28bn in the region's budget for 1996. None of this
will come from Madrid, which has emphasised the plan's exclusion from
PEN.

Only one other gas aim from the 1991 PEN proposals has yet to be
carried out: a 100km pipe-line connecting Aranda del Duero and
Valladolid.

Approved additions to PEN are: a 570km pipeline linking Almendralejo
(Extremadura) and Oviedo (Asturias) with a compression station;
extending the Aranda-Valladolid line to a junction with the
Almendralejo-Oviedo link at Zamora; and increasing the diameter of the
planned 220km pipeline linking Valencia, Orihela and Cartagena from 20
to 30 inches. Enagas has said it is studying a further 175km extension
to this pipeline to Almeria, which would cost an estimated Pta10.32bn.

Also in Andalucia, Gas Natural said last November that infrastructural
investment in the region would top Pta120bn by the year 2000. This sum
includes laying the Andalucian section of the Maghreb-Europe pipeline,
the Cordoba-Jaen-Granada pipeline and pipelines to take Algerian gas to
Cadiz, Malaga, Jerez de la Frontera and Campo de Gibraltar.

It also includes work carried out at the docking facilities at the
Palos de la Frontera regasification plant. Gas Natural expects
Andalucia to consume 12.8bn thermies/yr after 2005.

Power utility Sevillana has meanwhile awarded a Pta2bn contract to the
industrial group Babcock Wilcox to convert the 540 MW second generating
group of the company's Bahia de Algeciras power station to gas.

SWEDISH ENERGY COMMISSION REPORT ON NUCLEAR PHASE-OUT

One of Sweden's 12 nuclear reactors can be closed before the next
general elections in 1998, but all 12 cannot be phased out before 2010.
This is the somewhat unsurprising conclusion of the national energy
commission that has been studying the matter.

That Sweden can manage on 11 reactors is proven by the fact that
Sweden's oldest reactor, the 400 MW Oskarshamn 1, has been standing
idle for over three years. But on the very same day that the commission
published its report, the Swedish nuclear inspectorate gave Sydkraft
the go-ahead to restart the reactor.

The energy commission has not fulfilled its stated task of solving
Sweden's nuclear power problems once and for all, but it has produced
600 pages of background material for political bargaining on how to
fulfil the parliamentary decision from 1980 to phase out nuclear power.

Political commentator Anders Isaksson called the energy commission's
document "another meaningless report in an over-studied question, a
politically bespoke tailoring that has been run from the government,
whose conclusions are based on - for the moment - politically correct
assumptions."

The last part of Isaksson's comment refers to the fact that, just a few
weeks ago, the commission majority believed that two reactors could be
closed by 1998. The change has been explained by the assumption that
the government wanted space to negotiate.

Political make-up

The political majority of the commission is constituted by the
Christian Democratic Party, the Liberals and the ruling Social
Democratic party. The conservative party is openly pro-nuclear these
days, while the environmentalists and the leftists are too anti-nuclear
for the agreement.

The government also wants the Centre Party to join the agreement, but
there will be a price to pay. The Centre is an anti-nuclear, pro-
biomass farmer's party with a long-standing environmental reputation to
defend. It does, however, accept slightly increased use of natural gas
to make up for the loss of energy production when nuclear power plants
are closed, but the party does not want to abolish 2010 as the final
year for nuclear, and wants to phase out two - not one - reactors
before 1998.

The real negotiations are expected to start in March, when the Social
Democrats will elect a new leader to follow outgoing premier Ingvar
Carlsson.

The only candidate - finance minister Goeran Persson - has declared
that he has the same views on energy as the current premier, which
means respecting the 1980 referendum decision to phase out all nuclear
power by 2010 without harnessing more hydro resources, while keeping
CO2 emissions at the 1990 level and maintaining internationally
competitive electricity prices.

Persson says it will be hard to meet these goals. But all his promises
are currently being viewed with doubt, since he was still steadfastly
denying that he would stand as party leader only hours before he
officially accepted the offer from the election committee.

Half nuclear, half hydro

Sweden currently uses 140 TWh/yr of electricity, of which half is
nuclear, half hydro. The energy commission contends that Sweden will
need 159 TWh electricity by 2010, and that 15 TWh of the requirement
can be reduced by energy efficiency, while another 10 TWh can be
covered by conversion to other forms of energy.

Hydro power is projected to account for 64 TWh, roughly the same as
today. Current wind power, cogeneration in industry and district
heating will yield 13 TWh. New wind power and cogeneration plants could
provide 11 TWh, which leaves 46 TWh of the electricity requirement
still to be covered.

Energy minister Joergen Andersson says that natural gas could provide
12-30 TWh of electricity and new hydro sources 27 TWh if all streams
and rivers were harnessed, which he himself does not believe to be a
realistic possibility.

The commission does not see natural gas as a large-scale alternative,
and believes that if the gas network is to be expanded from Gothenburg,
where it ends today, to Stockholm and on to Finland, it will be because
other nations have interest in the gas - either to sell Russian or
Norwegian gas or to consume it. In fact, Gazprom has offered to build a
grid through Sweden, which is seen as a means of securing an
alternative route for Russian gas to the European market. Sweden only
uses about 9 TWh/yr of natural gas.

It will cost some SKr70-90bn ($10.6-13.6bn) to replace nuclear power
with natural gas-fired plants, and possibly twice as much if biomass is
chosen as a fuel, according to the energy commission, which believes
that electricity prices can increase to an acceptable level if the
phase-out is allowed to be a slow process.

The free market for electricity introduced from the start of 1996 will
keep prices down, according to the commission. The high voltage price
in Sweden currently is SKr0.20/kWh, while electricity from new natural
gas-fired plants would cost Skr0.25-0.30/kWh and from biomass over
SKr0.40/kWh.

Three phase-out guidelines

The commission has set out three main possible guidelines for the phase-
out:

* 1) a law that would prohibit nuclear power. This could mean paying
compensation to the power utilities and tough negotiations. The
utilities claim they have a right to total compensation and insist that
it should be in the form of new production facilities.

* 2) taxation of nuclear power plants. The tax should increase with the
age of the reactor. This would make nuclear power less competitive
since the owners also need to invest in maintenance of the plants.

* 3) subsidies to energy sources that are favourable for climatic and
environmental reasons.

A cold snap over the Christmas holiday season served to help
concentrate minds on the matter of electricity supply. Some 24,000 MW
was needed each day between Christmas and New Year, 4,000 MW more than
usual at this time of the year. Sweden's total capacity is over 33,000
MW, but grid problems reduce the available capacity to 29,000 MW.

The nuclear inspectorate has meanwhile given permission to restart
Sweden's oldest nuclear reactor Oskarshamn 1, after over three years of
standstill.

Problems at Oskarshamn

The inspectorate ordered the closure of Oskarshamn 1 and four other
reactors in September 1992 after a near-accident with the emergency
cooling water system in the Barsebaeck 2 reactor. While repairs were
being made other deficiencies were found and Oskarshamn 1 was given a
total renovation. Only the reactor tank has not been altered. The
reactor was started in 1972.

Oskarshamn 1 has been given a provisional permit until summer, when the
inspectorate will decide on prolonging the permit, at most until the
summer of 1999.

The renovation of the reactor is something of a model for the demands
on other reactors when they grow older, according to the inspectorate.
New methods for analysis have shown the weakness in some of the older
constructions, e.g. safety systems against fires and flooding should be
improved. The utilities' ambitions for improvements have not been high
enough in earlier plans, says the inspectorate.

* Meanwhile, a trade union dispute is taking place at the four reactors
in Oskarshamn. Electricians have refused to be undergo drug tests for
alcohol and narcotics: other unions have agreed to random checks, but
the electricians do not believe them necessary for safety reasons.
There was no problem in starting tests at the Ringhals nuclear plant.
The tests were introduced after a woman was killed: her brother was
suspected of committing the crime and had worked at the nuclear plant,
although he had previous convictions for narcotics crime and illegal
possession of weapons.

FORMER EDF HEAD AVOIDS OIL JOB

Former Electricite de France (EdF) president Gilles Menage has
successfully resisted the presidency of the Institut francais du
petrole, which was being offered to him as a consolation prize for his
sacking. Menage did not have any obvious qualification to head the
research body, and did not want the post. Indeed, the institute, which
brings together the French oil companies Elf and Total, as well as Gaz
de France and the motor manufacturers Peugeot/Citroen and Renault, will
be better off with Pierre Jacquard, who has spent over 25 years in
house. Jacquard, who has been general manager since 1988, was elected
unanimously to be both president and general manager. His election
marks an effort by the institute to become more independent of the
government.

INCIDENT ON AMOCO GAS RIG

Workers escaped injury in an apparent explosion on a North Sea gas
production platform. Operators Amoco (UK) Exploration Company said an
investigation was under way into the incident on 49/27/Alpha platform,
58km northeast of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. A spokesman said there was a
"circuit breaker trip" - much like a fuse blowing. There was no fire,
but some smoke. There was no evacuation after the incident, he said.

BAVARIAN/CZECH OIL LINK ON LINE

A 340km oil pipeline from Ingolstadt in southern Germany to the Czech
Republic has just come on stream. The joint Bavarian/Czech venture will
become fully operational in April this year. The DM725m ($503m)
project, dubbed 'Mero', is to help towards making the Czech Republic
independent of Russian crude. It will transport up to 15mt/yr of crude
from Western to Eastern Europe. Mero is the first oil pipeline linking
Germany with a central European country. At the same time, the
construction of a 600,000cm oil storage facility near Prague was
concluded.

OMV EYES ADRIATIC RETAIL EXPANSION

Now that a degree of peace has reached the area, Austria's state-
controlled OMV energy concern has moved quickly in the Adriatic states
to gain market share before the expected arrival of major multinational
oil companies. Via its 50%-owned distributor Slomin Holding Druzba (EER
427/10), OMV last year combined its retail activities in northern
Italy, Slovenia and Croatia. From a starting base of 79 filling
stations, the Slomin Holding outlets have expanded to 94, with the
newest station opened in Maribor, Slovenia, last month. Slomin Holding
last year retailed 560,000t of mineral oil products, with 1995 sales
topping Sch2bn ($197m), a gain of 13.2% over 1994 on a 4.5% increase in
product volume in tonnes. Investments totalling Sch422m are planned for
1996.

RWE-DEA DETAILS INVESTMENT PLANS

The RWE-DEA oil and chemicals group will invest "far more than DM1bn
($693m)" in the 1995/1996 business year (ending 30 June) after DM723m a
year earlier, according to chairman Peter Koch. As he explained in an
in-house publication, chemicals would account for 40% of the total, due
to a stake bought earlier in Italian company Enichem Augusta. Of the
remainder, one third would be spent on downstream and another quarter
on upstream activities.

WINTER WEATHER EXPOSES BG TO CRITICS

British Gas (BG) admitted it had been "caught out" by the severity of
the UK's Christmas weather and had been unable to fulfil its commitment
to all its customers with service contracts. Thousands of people with
'Three Star' contracts were reportedly left without heating during the
holiday period - some for several days - after engineers failed to turn
up to repair central heating faults. Under the "peace of mind" service
scheme, customers are promised that a gas engineer will be despatched
within 24 hours of the problem being reported. Spokesman Andrew Davis
said: "In some areas we were caught out . . . We will look at what
happened to make sure that we learn from this next year." He said that
conditions were so extreme in Glasgow, for example, that the diesel
fuel in service vans froze.

EDP UNVEILS PRICE CUT PROGRAMME

Electricidade de Portugal (EdP), the state power utility, is to cut
prices for industrial and commercial users by 5-8% in nominal terms in
1996. Taking account of expected inflation, this represents a reduction
in real terms of 8.5-11.5%, says EdP. Prices are to be 5% lower during
peak hours and 8% lower at other times. Prices for domestic consumers
will be held flat in nominal terms in 1996. EdP has also forecast that
its 1995 profits will double from 1994's Esc30.5bn ($203m).

GERMAN MINI-CHP INTEREST BOOMS

Although supplying only a niche market, small unit-type CHP stations
are becoming ever more popular, according to the results of a survey by
the German utilities' association, VDEW. By the end of 1994, 1,577 of
the mini-CHP plants, owned by industry and municipalities, were in
operation, some 37% more than in 1992. A further 75 were under
construction and 33 planned. Almost 90% of the plant had an electricity
generating capacity of under 1 MW. By end-1994, total capacity had
risen to 872 MWe compared with 577 MWe two years previously.

DENMARK'S 3Q GAS DEMAND UP 9%

According to figures released by the Danish national statistics bureau,
consumption of natural gas rose 9% to 14.15 PJ in the third quarter of
1995, compared to the corresponding period the previous year. Oil sales
fell by just under 2% to 72.35 PJ in July-September 1995 while sales of
electricity were almost unchanged at 7.454 TWh. Meanwhile, biodiesel
sales increased 8% to comprise 51.5% of total diesel sales in the
period under review.
