</A></H2>

<P>
VTT Manufacturing with Outokumpu Poricopper Oy and High Speed Tech Oy delivered test samples of first wall heat sink structures to the NET Team. The samples are made by explosive bonding of copper and stainless steel. </P>
<P>
High Speed Tech Oy with VTT Manufacturing has presented the explosive welding technology to the NET Team. </P>
<P>
Rauma Materials Technology Oy provides the stainless steel and powder metallurgy expertise in the heat sink component development and fabrication.</P> </P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="super">Superconductors </A></H2>

<P>
The construction of the ITER machine will create an enormous peak in the world production of superconductors. Also the requirement of uniform quality will be stricter than ever before.</P> </P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="diam">Diamond-like coatings </A></H2>

<P>
DIARC Technology Oy has developed a plasma spray tool for diamond like coating. A number of samples has been delivered to the NET Team. The objective is to provide an in-situ plasma spray tool for the ITER machine first wall paste coating. </P>
<P>
DIARC Technology has a contract with the NET Team to provide thick graphite coatings to be tested in fusion machines.</P> </P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="remote">Remote handling </A></H2>

<P>
Plustech Oy has made a feasibility study with Finnish research institutes. The object of the study was the maintenance of the ex-vessel area of the ITER machine, especially the secondary vacuum area.</P> 
<P>
The proposed technical solution is a walking and climbing platform, which is able to move along the secondary vacuum area floor, wall and ceiling. The platform is connected to the wall by connection points, along which the platform walks and climbs.</P> </P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="water">Water hydraulics </A></H2>

<P>
Hytar Oy has made a feasibility study with the Institute of Hydraulics and Automation (IHA) at the Tampere University of Technology. The benefits of the water hydraulics over electromechanical power transmission are the superior power-to-weight ratio and simplicity.</P> </P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="power">Power plant technology </A></H2>

<P>
In the Finnish Fusion Programme Imatran Voima Oy represents know-how and experience in power plant design, construction and operation.</P> 
<P>
Imatran Voima Oy has made a cooperation agreement with the EFET (European Fusion Engineering and Technology) group and is currently involved in two design tasks: - In-Vessel Viewing System - Design of a Dielectric Window for the ICRF System</P>
