<h3><CENTER><B><I>The ERIC/OSEP Special Project </B></I></CENTER></h3>

Through ERIC EC, CEC also operates the ERIC/OSEP Special Project, which
disseminates special education research through a variety of publications and
conferences.  Audiences include teachers and related services professionals, trainers,
administrators, policymakers, researchers, families, and others who are involved in the
development and delivery of special education services. <P>

The ERIC/OSEP Special Project tracks current research, plans and coordinates
research conferences, and develops publications that summarize recent research on
critical issues and topics.  These publications include an <a href="rsrchdir.htm">annual directory of research
projects</a> as well as publications that synthesize research efforts. <P>

Each year, the Special Project hosts a conference for directors of OSEP-sponsored
research projects.  Throughout the year, research forums and work groups are held that
bring together experts on emerging topics of interest.  Focus groups representing the
Special Project's audiences are held to inform OSEP and the Special Project of
information needs and to enhance the utility of publications produced by the Special
Project and other dissemination groups. <P>

The ERIC/OSEP Special Project is funded under a three-party contract among The
Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), the Office of Special Education Programs
(OSEP), and the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), U.S.
Department of Education.  Under this contract, OSEP funds the ERIC/OSEP Special
Project, and OERI funds the ERIC Clearinghouse on Disabilities and Gifted
Education.<P>
