Since its founding in 1984, the primary effort of Vortec Corporation has focused on the research and development (R&D) necessary  to be at the leading edge in high temperature, waste processing and recycling technologies. R&D to date has emphasized waste vitrification, waste recycling, glass melting and refining, high temperature heat recovery, furnace development, and advanced power cycle assessment.Vortec is now at a stage where its patented technologies are ready to meet market demands and opportunities.

Vortec Corporation of Collegeville, PA has been awarded an <B>$11.6 million prime contract</B> by the U.S. Department of Energy Morgantown Energy Technology Center to construct a transportable vitrification process to demonstrate the remediation of hazardous and radioactive soils. The contract is sponsored by the DOE Office of Technology Development (EM-50) and is headed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary, Dr. Clyde Frank.<P>

The U.S. Department of Energy has selected the gaseous diffusion plant located in Paducah, Kentucky as the commercial demonstration site for the Vortec Corporation advanced vitrification process. (2) The waste remediation plant will incorporate the use of the Vortec patented glass melting system known as the CMS (TM)for the vitrification process unit. Vitrification is being used for the processing of radioactive solid waste at the site because it produces a glass product which is chemically stable for thousands of years. The Vortec CMS (TM) is unique in that it allows for the simultaneous processing of organic, heavy metal, and radionuclide containing waste materials. (1)<P>

Ormet Primary Aluminum Corporation of Wheeling, WV has entered into a <B>licensing agreement</B> with Vortec Corporation to purchase Vortec's patented Cyclone Melting System (CMSTM) for the recycling of spent aluminum pot liners (SPL). Disposal of SPL, a cyanide and fluoride containing waste (KO88), is a problem that has been plaguing the aluminum industry for years. The predicament is being brought to a head due to the EPA land ban scheduled to be enacted in 1996. The Vortec CMS (TM) vitrification process purchased by Ormet not only meets EPA requirements, but also recycles the waste into value-added glass and ceramic products - thus eliminating the long term liability of landfilling wastes.

WELKO Industriale s.p.a. (ITALY) a major supplier of ceramic tile manufacturing equipment and Vortec Corporation (USA) are introducing a new ceramic tile which incorporates recycled industrial waste into the tile product. This new product is called ³EKOTILE² because it is ecologically and environmentally sound approach for solving industrial waste disposal problems. The <B>strategic alliance</B> between Vortec and Welko combines the necessary engineering and technical capability for building turn-key ceramic tile manufacturing lines using the new technology.
