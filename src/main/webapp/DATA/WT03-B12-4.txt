Loral Chief Taking Globalstar Reigns;
Move Seen as Plus for $2 Billion Project

     As part of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s $10 billion deal to
acquire most of Loral Corp., Globalstar L.P. will get a respected
industry leader to champion it in the "Big LEO" (low earth-orbit)
mobile satellite services market.  Bernard Schwartz, Chairman of
Loral, will become Chairman and CEO of Loral Space and
Communications Corp., a new company to be formed in connection
with the Lockheed Martin/Loral deal.  Loral Space will be the
managing general partner of Globalstar, inheriting Loral's 31%
stake in Globalstar as well as other assets.

     Mr. Schwartz is widely credited with building Loral from an
unprofitable company two decades ago into a multibillion-dollar
industry leader today through a series of strategic acquisitions. 
The addition of Mr. Schwartz to the Globalstar management team
diminishes a major criticism of the $2 billion project, said
Robert Kaimowitz, a satellite communications analyst at Unterberg
Harris in New York.  Globalstar has been criticized for lacking a
focused management team, Mr. Kaimowitz noted.

     Mr. Schwartz said at a press conference announcing the deal
that he plans to focus most of his time on Globalstar.  Having
Mr. Schwartz champion Globalstar "strengthens" the global
communications project, Mr. Kaimowitz said, adding that Mr.
Schwartz's involvement "ensures that the system will be built."

     He expressed doubts that the competing global satellite
systems of Iridium, Inc. (led by Motorola, Inc.) and Odyssey (led
by TRW, Inc.) both would make it to the market.  In a research
report on Globalstar, analysts at Unterberg Harris recently
wrote:  "We do not believe that Iridium will present real
competition because of its complex [satellite] architecture,
expensive pricing, and murky marketing plan.  Although Odyssey
has proposed what many experts believe is the best system
architecture, we have yet to see signs that TRW/Teleglobe [of
Canada] is close to raising the money necessary to build the
system. . .Our view is that Globalstar's real competition will be
ICO Global Communications (Inmarsat-P), possibly resulting in
only two players in a potentially large market."

     Globalstar spokesman Tom Ross echoed similar comments
regarding Mr. Schwartz, noting that the executive's track record
is "very, very good."  In addition to his duties as Chairman and
CEO of Loral Space, Mr. Schwartz will become a Director and Vice
Chairman of Lockheed Martin.  Globalstar investors applauded the
news, sending its shares up $6.375 to close at $40.50 on the day
of the announcement.

Lockheed Martin To Buy Most of Loral

     In a deal valued at more than $10 billion, Lockheed Martin
will buy Loral's defense electronics and system integration
businesses for $9.1 billion, including $2.1 billion of assumed
debt.  It also will invest $344 million for a 20% equity position
in Loral Space at an effective price of $7.50 per share. 
Lockheed Martin will pay $38 in cash per share to Loral
shareholders through a tender offer that was scheduled to begin
Jan. 12.  Loral shareholders also will receive one share of Loral
Space for each share of Loral.  The transaction is expected to
close by the end of February.

     Loral Space will begin business with more than $700 million
in cash and no debt, the companies said.  Lockheed Martin will
provide Loral Space with support in key technologies while
remaining a major maker of military and commercial satellites. 
In addition to the 31% stake in Globalstar, Loral Space will
receive Loral's 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral, a commercial
satellite manufacturer, and its 22% interest in K&F Industries,
Inc., an aircraft brake company.

     Other assets of the new company will include all of Loral's
Globalstar service provider franchises in Canada, Mexico, and
Brazil and Loral's interest in proposed projects involving
domestic and international direct broadcast satellite (DBS) and
broadband data services.  Mr. Schwartz said Monday, Jan. 8, that
Loral Space will use its Space Systems/Loral holdings to expand
the new company's DBS business.

     Mr. Kaimowitz said Loral Space has a book value of $1.8
billion or $7.80 per share.  After backing out cash, Globalstar
represents 83% of the assets of Loral Space, he noted.  Loral
Space's book value is broken down as follows:

     *    The 31% interest in Globalstar ($650 million),

     *    The 33% interest in Space Systems/Loral ($150 million),

     *    The 22% interest in K&F ($50 million),

     *    2.8% in management fees from Globalstar ($250 million),

     *    $700 million in cash, and

     *    An undetermined value for the service provider
franchises.

Schwartz Holds Out for Higher Globalstar Value

     Mr. Schwartz said one reason Lockheed Martin did not acquire
all of Loral was the high price he placed on Loral's 31% interest
in Globalstar.  Seeing value in the creation of a global
communications network of 48 satellites, Mr. Schwartz pointed out
that globally, more than 3.9 billion people lack telephone
service, and 30 million people currently are waiting for a phone. 
If Globalstar begins service as scheduled in 1998, Mr. Schwartz
predicted that the company would have three million customers and
$2.7 billion in annual revenue by the year 2002.

     Globalstar's current capital structure consists of $300
million of equity from its 11 partners and $200 million of equity
from its initial public offering in February 1995.  Loral Space
is the largest Globalstar shareholder, followed by public
shareholders as a group and then Qualcomm, Inc., with an 8%
stake.  Vendor financing adds another $300 million, and a new
bank financing agreement chips in $250 million.  Additional
internal financing--payments from exclusive service providers
(the local telephone companies) in 73 countries--will contribute
another $350 million over the next few years.

     The $2 billion project still requires $600 million in
additional external financing.  Mr. Schwartz said that Globalstar
would try to raise the money in the debt markets or would turn to
Loral Space and Globalstar's other investors for the funds. 
Globalstar pulled a $400 million high-yield debt offering from
the market in October.  Mr. Kaimowitz said this happened not
because of a lack of investor interest, as widely believed, but
because Globalstar could get "debt at a cheaper price" from the
banks.

     He noted that Loral Space's $700 million in cash and no debt
provides "a vast opportunity to finance the Globalstar project in
very creative ways, with less need for traditional financing
methods."  

     The Lockheed Martin/Loral deal is subject to U.S. and
European antitrust and other approvals.  It also requires at
least two-thirds of Loral's shares to be tendered.

     Lockheed Martin Chairman Daniel Tellep and Mr. Schwartz said
they do not expect antitrust concerns to stymie the transaction,
especially since Loral's space business will remain a separate
company.  Mr. Kaimowitz agreed, noting that the businesses
Lockheed Martin is acquiring from Loral have very little overlap
with its existing operations.  A $10 billion credit agreement for
Lockheed Martin is being led by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., Bank
of America, and Citicorp USA.

Intelsat Will Consider
Restructuring Plan This Year

     By September, Intelsat's Board of Governors expects to have
"a better idea of the future structure" of the international
satellite consortium, reports Maury J. Mechanick,
VP-international and regulatory affairs for U.S. signatory Comsat
Corp.  Intelsat has a "restructuring work plan in place," he said
during a public briefing on actions taken at the board's year-end
meeting in Washington.  A special Intelsat "working party" and a
special board committee are exploring the future structure of the
consortium, he explained.

     As part of Intelsat's ongoing effort to improve customer
service, the board decided at its December meeting to establish
four regional service support centers.  Intelsat also will
restructure its sales and marketing division and establish new
internal accounting processes.

     Commenting on financial matters, Mr. Mechanick said the
board approved Intelsat's 1996 budget, which projects $876
million in total revenues and $496 million in capital
expenditures.  Those figures represent a 10.8% increase in
revenues and a 25% decrease in capital expenditures from the 1995
budget.  He said preliminary figures show actual 1995 revenues
totaling $800 million, while operating expenses were $75,000
under budget.

Sterling Software To Spin Off
Electronic Commerce Group

     One of the world's largest software development firms,
Sterling Software, Inc., will spin off its lucrative Electronic
Commerce group this year to create a wholly owned subsidiary,
Sterling Commerce, Inc.  According to Dawn Wheeler, who will
direct investor relations for the new company, an initial public
offering is scheduled for the first quarter of this year.  The
IPO will comprise 16% of Sterling's common stock.

     The company filed an S1 registration document with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Dec. 20, 1995, and expects
approval within 60 days.  Once the IPO is complete, the company
will begin a tax-free spin-off by Sept. 30, the end of Sterling's
fiscal year. 

     The Electronic Commerce group experienced growth of 35% in
1994--about 5% above the growth rate of the electronic commerce
market in that period, according to company figures.  This record
continued into 1995:  The group had revenues of $217.8 million
for the year, an increase of 31% over the previous year's figure. 
Operating profit increased 33% in the same period.

     The group's success is due, in large part, to its recent
focus on developing software for small and midsize businesses, as
well as its strong position in the electronic data interchange
(EDI) market.  In 1994, Sterling acquired American Business
Computer Company, Inc., a leading provider of EDI translation
software for the UNIX platform.

     But the most visible--and possibly the most important--move
for the Electronic Commerce group was its work last year with
Visa International, Inc., to develop the E-Pay system.  E-Pay is
a "fully electronic system for processing consumer-initiated
bills," the companies said.  It relies on a collection of EDI
standards that allow electronically generated bills and bill
payments to be processed by banks, billers, and other financial
institutions.  Sterling provides the key EDI-based software that
translates Visa account and customer information into a
standardized format and reconciles payee lists between billers
and their banks.  Currently, about 70% of electronic payments are
first converted to paper before being processed.  E-Pay, which is
designed to eliminate that step, will be a major building block
of Internet-based billing platforms of the future.

Analysts Cite Antitrust, Market Issues
For Possible Bell Atlantic-NYNEX Merger

     Although it would make "a lot of sense" for Bell Atlantic
Corp. and NYNEX Corp. to merge their local exchange or future
interexchange operations, antitrust and other issues could dampen
enthusiasm for pursuing a deal, industry analysts say.  Few were
surprised by recent press reports that executives of the two
companies have had preliminary merger discussions.  They note
that the "Northeast Corridor" market that a combined NYNEX-Bell
Atlantic could serve would provide substantial revenues if
federal legislation allows Bell companies to provide interLATA
(local access and transport area) services.

     "The synergy between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic is apparent
when you view their market," one interexchange industry observer
emphasizes.  The combined Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and
Washington areas would constitute "perhaps the most lucrative
single market in the U.S."  But some analysts caution that
increasing competition could erode the companies' local exchange
market shares.  They also warn that potential clashes over top
positions in the combined companies and layoffs could temper
enthusiasm for merger talks.

     Believing that the compromise on federal telecom legislation
is "very positive from a NYNEX perspective," analysts William D.
Vogel and Alexandra E. Kairis of NatWest Securities Corp. suggest
that a further combination of specific NYNEX-Bell Atlantic
businesses (not a full-blown merger) may make sense:  

     "The facilities-based test for local telephone company entry
into long distance does not specify any market share requirement
or percentage of lines passed by a second local carrier.  We
believe Congress understands that the long distance industry is
an overpriced cartel with excess capacity, and that more
competitors will result in lower prices and more meaningful
choices for residential and business customers. . .

     "NYNEX has fewer hurdles than any other Bell company.  With
the competitive environment fostered by the regulators in New
York and Massachusetts, NYNEX has already got facilities-based
competition as well as substantial unbundling of network elements
already under way.  We believe they will be fully compliant by
1997 if the present language passes.  This is great news for
customers because of the buying power NYNEX will have as it shops
for long distance minutes from AT&T, MCI, and Sprint on behalf of
its residential and business clients."

     They say "a case could be made that aggregating NYNEX and
Bell Atlantic's customer base to combine their buying power for
long distance minutes, as well as sharing marketing and
back-office costs, could make sense.  However, a full-blown
merger of the two companies at this time while the two firms are
already in the process of undertaking tremendous restructuring
programs seems provocative but unrealistic."

     A recent study Probe Research, Inc., explores the combined
performance of the NYNEX and Bell Atlantic telephone companies
between 1988 and 1994.  "The telephone side of the business for
these two companies is just not generating enormous returns,"
says Allan Tumolillo, Probe's Chief Operating Officer.  As
measured by revenues and assets per line, the performance of the
telcos has been "relatively flat," he notes.  Data for both
companies shows that per-line revenues and assets have increased
by less than 0.5% annually, according to The Telephone Book IV, a
report based on the study.  Similarly, measurements show that
revenues and assets increased about 7.5% per employee at both
companies during the period from 1988 to 1994.

     "They've achieved that because [Bell Atlantic and NYNEX]
have gotten rid of employees," Mr. Tumolillo explains.  "All the
cash flow has been generated through employee reductions."  The
combined number of employees dropped from about 143,600 in 1988
to about 105,400 at the end of 1994.  If the companies merge, Mr.
Tumolillo predicts they would eliminate duplicative positions and
reduce the payroll by about 10,000 more employees over the next
18 to 24 months, generating more cash flow.

     He suggests that a combined company "hunker down and become
a primarily urban company."  NYNEX has "no strategic reason" to
be in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire (except for the outlying
Boston suburbs), and some parts of central and upstate New York,
he says.  Independent telcos could purchase those exchanges,
pursuing a "clustering" strategy similar to that pursued by the
cable TV industry.

     Any merger discussions between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic
probably would not resemble the negotiations that preceded Bell
Atlantic's abortive attempt to merge with cable giant
Tele-Communications, Inc.  NYNEX and Bell Atlantic "know each
other's business very well," Mr. Tumolillo points out, citing the
companies' combined cellular operations.  Nevertheless,
leadership issues could arise.  Neither Bell Atlantic
Chairman/CEO Raymond W. Smith nor NYNEX Chairman/CEO Ivan G.
Seidenberg is nearing retirement age.

Relationship Already Exists Based on Cellular Deal

     Robert H. Mayer, Senior Manager-telecommunications
consulting for Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, suggests that
a NYNEX-Bell Atlantic deal might come together smoothly because
the companies "already have a relationship through the cellular
business."  The CEOs "get along and have a vision" for their
companies, he says.  He also predicts substantial corporate
"downsizing" if a merger takes place, particularly in "corporate
services" units overseeing human relations, legal, and external
affairs functions.

     Commenting that the field is increasingly becoming a "market
for big players," Mr. Mayer expects any Bell company merger to
trigger a new flurry of deals between other telecom giants.  But
whether Bell company mergers can pass antitrust muster could
become the "$64,000 question," some observers believe.  The
Clinton administration "hasn't been very aggressive" in bringing
antitrust cases, Mr. Mayer notes.  "If the Democrats haven't been
[aggressive], Republicans probably would be even less so."  While
the Justice Department may not "put [Bell company mergers] under
a microscope," it will take action if it finds that predatory
pricing is being used to stifle competition, he says.

     Some analysts believe that Pacific Telesis Group could be a
potential Bell Atlantic-NYNEX partner, creating a "huge
enterprise" carrying traffic between the coasts--"the most
sizable and lucrative single chunk of the interexchange market,"
one observer says.  The three companies combined also could carry
half of the international traffic in the country, says Richard
Klugman, First Vice President at PaineWebber.

     Philip J. Sirlin, a telecom analyst at Schroder Wertheim &
Co., Inc., says a merged Bell Atlantic-NYNEX could have more
difficulty defending local exchange markets.  He also questions
whether any merger deal could satisfy both Messrs. Smith and
Seidenberg.  "This is never a trivial issue in a merger," he
says.  "And when you have two roughly equivalent companies,
you've got a particular problem. . .That alone reduces some of
the likelihood" that a merger deal will be concluded, he
suggests.

     Meanwhile, interexchange carriers are the new focus of
merger and acquisition discussions at Bell companies, Mr. Sirlin
says.  By acquiring an interexchange carrier such as LDDS
WorldCom, a Bell company could acquire a national network
relatively quickly.  "I wouldn't be surprised if every [Bell
company] is studying the feasibility of acquiring WorldCom right
now," he comments.  "And they should be."

The Telecom IPO Scoreboard:
How Did They Fare on Wall Street?

     This issue contains CBF's quarterly Telecom IPO Scoreboard
and related charts tracking upcoming initial public offerings. 
Every quarter, we report on companies poised to go public in the
next 30 to 60 days, those that have filed initial paperwork with
the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public in the
future, and the progress of companies that recently began trading
on the stock exchanges.  

     Readers can track the number of IPOs in telecom-related
sectors, how these IPOs are performing relative to the overall
market, and how one company's pubic offering fared on Wall Street
compared with that of others.  

     An increasing number of offerings (a larger pipeline of
money being fed into IPOs) would indicate greater venture capital
and entrepreneur interest in this sector.  A decrease in IPO
activity could indicate that interest is dampening or that the
market is reflecting information it has impounded about previous
offerings and is taking a "breather."

Impact of Legislation on Bell Companies
Depends on Regulatory Constraints

By Larry F. Darby

     Previous articles have discussed the probable effects of
regulatory reform legislation on various telecommunications
communities of interest--the broad public interest, consumers,
large users, the cable TV companies, and the long distance
carriers.  Such legislation is long overdue, and depending on the
final details to emerge from conference, the bills promise to add
considerably to development of the telecom infrastructure while
spurring economic growth and employment.

     The legislation will give users greater choice and lower
rates, both of which will accompany new market entry and
intensified competition among large, well-capitalized companies
whose markets now are protected from competition by statutory,
regulatory, and judicial barriers to market entry.

     The major threat to the enactment of legislation is that
some key lawmakers may succeed in imposing their view that
competition is too important to be left to the marketplace and
that our national welfare is best served by pervasive regulatory
interventions.  There still is considerable pressure from
interest groups to protect regulatory prerogatives and to have
major market conflicts resolved in administrative proceedings
rather than in the marketplace.  So, what else is new?

Bell Companies Are at a Turning Point

     We have deferred discussing the impact of legislation on the
Bell regional holding companies because much of the controversy
among House and Senate conferees centers on that issue.  It
remains to be determined whether, how, and to what extent the
final bill will permit RHCs to enter new markets and compete,
thereby compensating for the increased competition they will face
from long distance carriers and cable TV system operators in
their own core markets.

     The RHCs have evolved in very different directions, and
those differences will become more pronounced over time.  After
divestiture they shared some common goals:

     *    Become less reliant on regulated lines of business for
earnings,

     *    Reduce reliance on outside funding for network
construction and business expansion,

     *    Gradually finesse the line-of-business constraints
embodied in the Modified Final Judgment, and

     *    Meet shareholders' general requirements for growth and
earnings (in large measure by escaping the strictures of
rate-base, rate-of-return regulation).

     The RHCs generally have succeeded in meeting these broad
objectives, some more than others.  All have diversified their
earnings streams and growth opportunities.  Two of them --SBC
Communications, Inc., and U S WEST, Inc.--are generating about
half the basis for their total market capitalization outside the
regulated telephone business.  Wireless services and investments
in telecom assets in other countries make up the bulk of these
outside sources of market value.

     Most of the companies are able to fund their construction
requirements from depreciation accruals.  In recent quarters, the
sum of net income and depreciation charges has been about 15%
greater than the cash required to pay dividends and to fund the
construction budget.  (For context, we note that AT&T generates
about 50% more cash than is required for dividends and
construction, while the average for carriers in Europe is about
25% greater.)

     The companies have been quite successful in escaping the
confines of traditional earnings regulation that effectively
stripped them of the benefits of efficiency gains and
opportunities for earnings growth.  Price cap regulation of
federal access charges and a variety of incentive and price cap
plans in the states have almost completely supplanted
rate-of-return regulation as the dominant form of earnings
control.  These regulatory changes, more than any others, have
accounted for increased market valuation of these stocks in
recent years.

     Notwithstanding these successes, the Bell companies still
are trapped in the slowly growing, increasingly risky domestic
local wireline markets.  Market penetration is in the 95% range,
and new installations of primary lines are limited to the rate of
new housing starts.  Revenue growth from usage growth is stymied
in many jurisdictions by the imposition of flat-rate,
unlimited-use tariff structures.  In fact, usage-sensitive
pricing of local telephone services is unconstitutional in some
states.  

     The companies have been growing revenue by adding vertical,
value-added services made possible by software-controlled digital
switches.  Call waiting and forwarding and related services have
added handsomely to local revenues, but more ambitious forays
into broadband distribution--video dial tone, for example--have
not been too successful.  The RHCs still are burdened with rate
structures that do not match underlying cost structures, and the
resulting high-margin services have attracted considerable
interest from competitors.  New competition and the prospect of
even more entry (from long distance carriers and cable TV
systems) increases market risk substantially in the local
exchange.

Legislative Impact on Bells Depends on Regulatory Restraints

     The Bell companies look to the legislation (1) to permit
them to pursue new opportunities for growth and (2) for the means
to offset increases in market risk.  And when all is said and
done, the impact of the legislation on the RHCs depends on
details still being worked out.  Under any legislative outcome,
the Bells will be handicapped by their lack of experience in
competing openly in the marketplace.  J.B. Clark noted nearly a
century ago that "The greatest of all monopoly profits is the
quiet life."  So it is here.  Competition to date in the local
market is but a vague hint of what is about to come.

     Though the ultimate fate of Bell companies in the
marketplace will be determined by their ability to adjust from
the comfort of monopoly to the rigors of competition, the
legislation may either handicap them or accommodate their
transition.  Two elements of the legislation--and the way in
which regulators follow them up--are key to the Bells' success in
the new competitive environment.  The first is the timing of
competitive market entry; and second is the extent to which the
legislation imposes regulatory constraints on "competitive
adjustments" by the Bells and by their competitors.

     Time is money.  The timing of new competitive entry into
local and long distance markets is critical to the financial
valuation of both classes of carrier.  There has been much debate
in the conference committee about delaying RHC entry into the
long distance business until a date certain, or until specific
statutory requirements are met.  Frankly, I am a little puzzled
by that debate:  It is unclear how the public interest is served
by delaying RHC entry into the long distance market. 

     The argument that competition should be suppressed in that
market until it is more vigorous in the local exchange market is
not compelling.  The argument seems ultimately to turn on the
assumption that regulation is ineffective in prohibiting
anticompetitive market behavior.  Be that as it may, any
differences in the timing of lowering local and long distance
market entry barriers will be damaging to the Bells.  The battle
over customer control and the outcome of competing "one-stop
shopping" offers largely will be prejudged if the final bill
handicaps RHC entry into the long distance marketplace.

     A casual reading of the various "competitive checklists"
that have been advanced as necessary conditions precedent for
Bell company entry into the long distance market read like a
"communications lawyers' full employment act."   

     They are a sure blueprint for protracted market uncertainty
and regulatory/judicial delay.  Competitive safeguards in the
hands of clever legal advocates can be transformed into
regulatory barriers to entry.

     The second determinant of the impact that legislation will
have on the Bells has to do with competitive responses and
obligations.  AT&T and other long distance carriers have
supported language that will force the Bells to make bulk
capacity available to them for resale at "out-of-pocket" or
"avoidable" costs.  

     Despite economic efficiency arguments for such a
requirement, this pricing rule would permit long distance
carriers to avoid contributing to the fixed costs of the network,
thereby shifting that burden to other users.  In any event, such
a pricing rule would favor the long distance carriers to the
detriment of the local Bells.  Such a requirement, combined with
lags on the ability of the Bells to enter the long distance
market, would cause the RHCs to lose the accounts of large and
profitable customers to long distance carriers.  The RHCs'
ability to respond to new entrants and to defend their markets is
also critical.  In this regard, history is not very encouraging. 
AT&T was saddled with the regulatory baggage associated with its
designation by the FCC as a "dominant" carrier, long after the
market was regarded by most observers as workably competitive. 
The practical effect of such regulation has been, and will be,
"cartel management" by the regulators.

     The means of managing the allocation of market shares has
been the tariffing process--delays in the introduction of new
services and minimum rate restrictions on competitive services. 
New entrants' success in arguing that rate responses by
incumbents are predatory or embody cross-subsidies will be
critical to incumbents and new entrants alike.

     If legislators and regulators regard themselves as
instruments of market reallocation from incumbents to new
entrants, and if they adopt "fully distributed cost" allocation
rules for competitive services and "marginal cost" principles for
pricing resold bulk local capacity, the Bells will surely be big
losers.

UBS Analysts Tout Geoworks
For 'Concept-Oriented' Investors

     The pieces are "finally in place for the CCD (consumer
computing device) market to begin its long-awaited ramp,"
according to analysts Jeffrey A. Schelsinger and Scott W. Searle
at UBS Securities.  They view Geoworks, Inc.'s GEOS operating
system as "an enabling technology that will play an important
role in the development of this market.

     Given the "huge market opportunity for these devices, the
positioning of the company with leading consumer electronic
manufacturers, and the tremendous degree of operating leverage,
we believe Geoworks (GWRX) represents an excellent opportunity
for concept-oriented investors to play the convergence of network
computing and mobile communications."  Their investment thesis
follows:

     Over the last 20 years the binary world of ones and zeros
has driven tremendous change in the computer and communications
industries.  Maturing digital technology has facilitated market
transitions in these sectors, where companies with truly enabling
technology--technology that reduces cost and/or increases
functionality--have emerged to become industry leaders.

     When positioned on the right side of changes in technology,
investors have benefited from these market transitions. 
Centralized computing gave way to distributed processing and
desktop PCs (Compaq, Intel, Microsoft); stand-alone PCS were
connected into local area networks (Novell, Cisco, Bay Networks);
and now the promise of inter-networking and the Internet itself
(Spyglass, Netscape, UUNet) is creating very interesting
investment opportunities.

     Although much less mature, the wireless communications
industry also is undergoing significant change.  Analog
voice-centric networks are giving way to new digital systems
capable of efficient data communications.  Service markets once
characterized as monopolies/duopolies are becoming highly
competitive, as proliferation of wireless networks is occurring. 
Market focus and distribution channels for wireless products are
migrating from expensive verticals to low-cost mass consumer
markets.

     This is all well and good, but for the most part, the pony
is already out of the barn.  Where then is the next great
undiscovered opportunity?  Convergence.  The combination of
network computing and wireless communications will "untether"
users from enterprise networks and desktop PCs, thereby enhancing
the sharing and processing of information.

     As internetworking proliferates and the computing platform
becomes more hierarchical--the intelligence resides in the
network, not at the node--new consumer-oriented mobile computing
devices will emerge.  Online, as opposed to on-site, computing
places the "cost of computing" on the network and, therefore,
requires significantly less functionality in end-user devices. 
Less functionality means lower costs, which drives market
penetration.

     These next-generation devices will, however, have sufficient
computing resources to easily communicate with enterprise
networks, the Internet, and desktop PCS.  They will be packaged
in a truly mobile form factor (organizer/mobile telephone) and
have a cost structure consistent with other consumer electronic
devices.  All this is essential if the goal of indispensable
utility is to be reached (i.e., integrated into our daily lives).

     These new CCDs will start out as extensions of existing
consumer electronic product lines such as electronic organizers,
mobile companions, cellular telephones, and pagers.  In addition
to being interoperable with desktop PCs and enterprise networks,
these mobile devices will also support numerous wireless data
applications for messaging (e-mail, fax, and paging), information
delivery, remote access, and of course, the Internet.

     CCDs will utilize many existing digital technologies. 
Low-cost memory chips, fast and efficient microprocessors, and
high-resolution graphics displays all will be required.  The
idiosyncrasies of mobility and wireless communications, however, 
require new technology that will have to (1) be
communications-centric (wired and wireless), (2) be interoperable
with enterprise networks (the Internet and desktop PCs), and (3)
compensate for the limited bandwidth of wireless communications. 
The constraints of size, cost, and battery life are significant
in the world of mobility.

     With a focused strategy to deliver software products that
meet the price/performance demands of mobile computing, Geoworks
is well positioned to become a leading provider of operating
system and application software to the emerging CCD markets.  The
company's GEOS operating system offers a level of functionality
and efficiency that enables manufacturers of CCD devices
(electronic organizers and cellular telephones) to provide the
features and cost structure (less than $500 to the end-user)
necessary to penetrate the mass consumer market.

     Admittedly, the CCD market is in the early stages of
developing.  However, the adoption of the company's GEOS
operating system by several leading consumer electronic
manufacturers (Hewlett Packard, Nokia, and Toshiba) leaves
Geoworks very well positioned to capitalize on the convergence of
computing and wireless communications.

The Market:  Despite Failed Attempts, Huge Opportunity Exists

     The ability to tap into the vast organizer and mobile
telephone markets with value-added features will ultimately
ignite explosive unit volume growth.  We estimate that the total
CCD market will grow to $13 billion by 1998, with operating
system revenues accounting for approximately $250 million.

     First organizers & PDAs -- The organizer/PDA (personal
digital assistant) segment of the CCD market--devices priced at
more than $250--will drive early demand, as next-generation
mobile telephones ("smart phones") are not expected to be
introduced in Europe and Asia until late 1996.  The U.S. will be
at least another year behind because of a lack of digital
cellular/PCS infrastructure.  The organizer/PDA market segment is
forecast to grow from 4.4 million units in 1995 to 18.6 million
units in 1998.  Whereas low-end electronic organizers are
expected to grow only 6% per annum, PDAs with higher
functionality are forecast to grow 150% annually through 1998.

     The result:  a combined end-user market of $10.5 billion,
with PDAs representing 80% of the market.  Assuming royalties of
$10-$15 per unit, the organizer/PDA operating system market would
be valued at $186 million (based on $10 per unit) by 1998.  A
royalty of $10 per unit equates to less than 35% of the end-user
cost ($350) of a typical organizer/PDA CCD device.

     Then smart phones:  The worldwide market for digital mobile
phones is forecast to grow from 7 million handsets in 1995 to 20
million handsets in 1998, representing a $25 billion market. . .
An increasing percentage of these handsets is expected to
represent digital mobile phones with intelligent capabilities for
processing, storing, and communicating data information ("smart
phones").

     The installed base of smart phones is expected to reach 4
million by 1998, or approximately 20% of the digital phone
market. . .Assuming the smart phone market captures 10% of the
digital phone market, operating system revenues from this CCD
segment could exceed $75 million by 1998.

     Additionally, we believe the add-on product market could
represent an $80 million market by 1998, assuming one in two
purchasers of an organizer/PDA buys an add-on application for
$20.  We view this as conservative, in that Microsoft reports
add-on sales of 1:1 or better for applications relative to
operating system sales.

The Geoworks Solution

     Geoworks develops and markets operating systems and
applications for the emerging CCD market.  Geoworks' principal
system software, GEOS, is designed to meeting the constraints of
the mobile environment--limited microprocessor, memory, and
storage capacity.  GEOS provides a combination of functionality
and efficiency required by CCD hardware vendors in providing the
features and cost structure necessary for this market to follow
the explosive growth pattern of other successful consumer
electronics products.

     Strategy is simple:  Establish the GEOS operating system as
the de facto standard in the mobile CCD market.  Success at the
operating system level opens up the opportunity to sell
high-margin add-on software applications into the installed base
of users.  Initially, the target markets will be handheld
electronic organizers/PDAs (data-centric users) and smart phones
(voice-centric users).  Over time, higher-level information
appliances and interactive TV may be added.

     Strategic relationships --  Geoworks has entered into
strategic relationships with leading OEMs in the electronic
organizer and mobile telephone markets.  Several partners have
taken an equity interest in GWRX.

     *    Nokia -- The second leading provider of digital GSM
phones in Europe intends to incorporate GEOS in its first smart
phone, expected to be released next year.

     *    Hewlett-Packard -- It will incorporate the GEOS
operating system into a number of product lines, starting with
its sub-$350 electronic organizer, the Omnigo 100, which was
successfully introduced into European and U.S. markets this past
October.

n  Toshiba Corp. -- This leading consumer electronic manufacturer
plans to use GEOS in its development of smart phone products for
Asian markets.

n  Novell -- A leading provider of network operating systems, it
has authorized Geoworks to include Netware client software in its
GEOS system software for seamless integration with Novell
networks.

     Each of these companies has made a significant equity
investment in Geoworks for a combined ownership of approximately
18%.  Recognizing that wireless communications will drive
explosive growth in the CCD market, Geoworks has recently
announced a number of additional strategic alliances in this
area:

4  Notable Technologies -- provider of add-on software for
information delivery over paging networks;

4  Skytel -- leading provider of nationwide one-way and two-way
paging services;

4  Wynd Communications -- provider of wireless two-way messaging
services including e-mail via the Internet, fax, alpha paging,
and phone messages.

Leveraging the Model

     Geoworks' financial model maintains a tremendous amount of
operating leverage.  Unit volume growth in a royalty-driven
revenue model ($10-$15 per unit) drives contribution and earnings
as operating costs remain relatively fixed.  With increasing unit
volume shipments, we believe fully taxed net margins could exceed
20% in 1998.  This is reflected in our fiscal 1998 EPS estimate
of $0.50.

     Near term, the revenue stream will likely be lumpy,
reflecting the recognition of deferred revenues pertaining to
terminated projects.  In fiscal 1997 we project ships of
GEOS-based organizers/PDAs and smart phones to exceed 450,000 and
150,000 units, respectively.  This would represent royalty
revenues of approximately $7.5 million.  In addition, deferred
contract revenues of $3.5 to $4.0 million and add-on products'
sales bring total revenue in fiscal 1997 up to $13.3 million.

     For fiscal 1998, we anticipate total revenues of $38 million
($18.5 million in royalties plus $10.5 million from add-on
products).  In terms of operating expenses, we forecast healthy
growth in R&D expenses (25%-30%) to further develop GEOS and
add-on applications.  With sales and marketing provided by OEM
distribution channels, marketing and G&A expenses are expected to
grow modestly (15%-20%).  We believe positive operating leverage
can expand operating margins above 30% in fiscal 1998.

     Assuming the story unfolds as we think it will, and unit
volumes begin to ramp significantly in fiscal 1998, GWRX could
easily generate after-tax EPS in excess of $1.00 in fiscal 1999. 
Because of the high degree of operating leverage, this would only
require a 64% increase in revenues, year over year.  Furthermore,
if the company's existing OEM partners maintain their current
market share with respect to these next-generation products, our
fiscal 1999 numbers could prove conservative.

     Consequently, we have set our 18- to 24-month price target
at $30, or 30 times our tentative fiscal 1999 full-taxed EPS
estimate of $1.00.

The Year Ahead:  Merrill Lynch
Still Likes AirTouch Stock

     Analyst Linda J. Runyon at Merrill Lynch & Co. notes that
one of her firm's themes in 1995 was "to go international with
regard to cellular" holdings, and AirTouch Communications, Inc.
(ATI) "certainly fits this profile."  ATI is the sixth-largest
U.S. cellular company with 38 million population equivalents
("pops"), and the third-largest U.S. paging company with more
than 1.9 million pagers in service.  The company tops her
year-end list of recommended telecom/cellular stocks.  Ms.
Runyon's comments follow:

     ATI's international exposure continues to grow in both size
and importance.  In fact, the company now has more than 69
million "pops" through interests in licenses in Germany,
Portugal, Sweden, Belgium, South Korea, Italy, India, Spain, and
Japan.  For 1995, we estimate that ATI's proportional interests
in its international ventures will represent approximately 31% of
proportional revenues and 17% of proportional operating cash
flow.  By the year 2000 we believe that these numbers could grow
to as much as 46% and 44%, respectively.

     Moreover, we think that ATI's valuation is compelling at
these levels--especially given the 22% pullback in the shares
since mid-September.  On a valuation basis, we have a 12- to
18-month price objective of $35 per share, or 27% above current
levels.

What Has Changed?  Competition, from Within and Without

     *    First, we now have AT&T and MCI gearing up to go
head-to-head in wireless.  AT&T has recently gone nationwide with
its AT&T Wireless brand name, while MCI has chosen to go the
reseller route.  If MCI's experience with the resale of paging is
any indication of things to come in cellular, it could prove to
be an interesting year.

     *    Second, we now have more consumer packages being
introduced into the market.  We've got TeleGo from GTE and Talk
Along from Bell Atlantic/NYNEX.  Basically, we're starting to see
zone-sensitive packages, priced to attract the lower-usage
subscriber.  Nevertheless, revenue/subscriber/month continues to
decline faster than originally estimated.

     *    And third, personal communications services (PCS) are
coming, there's no doubt in our minds.  The first round of
auctions ended in March, and the second round of auctions is set
to begin shortly.  We've now got Sprint Spectrum PCS service in
Washington/Baltimore.  The question remains:  When does PCS
arrive on a widescale basis?  We think it's at least 1997-1998.

Current View:  Go Small or Go International?

     There's really no way around it.  Frankly, 1995 was a
difficult year for cellular equities. On average, the stocks in
our group are flat year-to-date and down over 30% relative to the
S&P 400.  As one portfolio manager pointed out, it was difficult
to perform that badly in 1995.  So, why did the stocks perform so
badly, and what does that mean for 1996?

     During 1995 the downward leg began with the PCS auctions,
continued with the LIN Broadcasting private market valuation
process, and gained new momentum this fall with concerns over the
rate of subscriber growth during 3Q 95.

     We understand the concerns over PCS.  We understand the
concerns over the LIN valuation.  So let's look at subscribers. 
During 3Q 95, subscribers included in our matrix of 19 companies
grew 42.4%, revenues grew 31.5%, and operating cash flow grew
42.3% versus 3Q 94--somewhat surprising given the stock
performance.  So, what is going on?

     Currently, the issue on everyone's mind is handset growth. 
Given comments by some of the equipment manufacturers regarding
U.S. analog handset revenue growth, the perception seems to be
that everyone who ever wanted a phone already has one, and that
growth as we know it has come to an end.  We don't happen to
agree, but it's interesting.

     In fact, over the course of the year, we have raised our
1995 ending subscriber estimate from 32.5 million to 34 million,
for 40.8% growth over 1994.  This implies a penetration rate for
the industry of more than 13.0%.  For 1996 we are estimating
ending subscribers of 44.4 million, up 30% over 1995, for a
penetration rate of 16.9%.  We'd like to point out that every
year so far--without exception--we have underestimated subscriber
growth.  But the question still remains, will 4Q 95 subscriber
growth be on target?  It's still too early to tell given that
50%-60% of the growth during the quarter comes in December.

     So, why go small or go international?  We recognize that
this is a repeat of our theme last year, and although it's small
consolation given the overall performance of the sector, smaller
market operators did outperform larger market operators during
1995.  We think that this trend could continue, given our belief
that competition will come to the smaller markets later and that
consolidation of smaller operators will continue over time.  With
regard to international, we see significant potential growth
opportunities, especially in some of the more underpenetrated
markets.  In many cases, we see international growth occurring at
a faster rate than growth here in the U.S.

1996 -- KEY ISSUES

     1.    Is subscriber growth slowing or not?  We think that
ultimately growth in net additions has to slow given the sheer
size of the wireless business.  However, we think that ending
subscriber numbers will continue to be strong in 1996, especially
given the added distribution power that AT&T and MCI will bring
to the table.

     2.    What exactly does PCS mean for the cellular business? 
When will PCS really enter the market?  How will it be priced? 
How will it affect growth?  How will it affect margins?  In other
markets, such as the U.K., the introduction of PCS has helped to
accelerate growth of the overall wireless market.  We expect that
this could ultimately occur in the U.S.  However, we don't
anticipate seeing widespread PCS until 1997-1998.

     3.    How is PCS going to be financed?  We think this could
be the single most important issue during 1996, as many of the
PCS operators look to raise financing within a similar time
frame.

     4.    And lastly, when will commercial CDMA (Code Division
Multiple Access) technology really be available, both for
cellular and for PCS?  We believe that ongoing uncertainty about
this issue will continue to cloud the competitive picture for
those cellular and PCS operators who have opted for CDMA.

BCI, INDIA's TATA GROUP IN TELECOM SERVICE PACTS

     Bell Canada International (BCI) and India's Tata Group have
formed a consortium to provide telecom services in the Indian
state of Andhra Pradesh, where the companies have won one of two
cellular telephone licenses.  The consortium also was found to
have submitted the only acceptable bid in the Jan. 1 bidding for
a basic telephone service license in Andhra Pradesh, BCI said.  

     Tata will hold 51% of the equity in the basic phone service
and cellular service companies, and BCI will own 39%.  The
remaining 10% will be held by American International Group, a
U.S. insurance firm.

     BCI said it could invest $35 million for the cellular
venture and about $100 million for the basic telephone service
venture.  Derek H. Burney, BCI's Chairman, President, and CEO,
said that "with cellular and basic service licenses in India,
cellular operations in Colombia and China, and cable [TV]
licenses in Brazil --each with strong local partners--BCI is
strategically positioned in some of the most attractive emerging
telecommunications markets in the world."

BROOKS FIBER ACQUIRES ENGINEERING, CONSULTING COMPANY

     Competitive local exchange carrier Brooks Fiber Properties,
Inc., has acquired the domestic consulting and engineering
business of its affiliate, Brooks Telecommunications, Inc.  The
international operations of Brooks Telecom will be spun off into
a new company, Brooks Telecommunications International, Inc.  The
transaction will make Brooks Fiber a "full-service" telecom
provider, the company said.  Brooks Telecommunications had owned
15% of Brooks Fiber.

     The move will give Brooks Fiber engineering and software
expertise, allowing it to offer customers a "new depth of
consultative support," according to CEO James C. Allen. 
Acquiring the domestic consulting unit--dubbed GLA International,
Inc.--will give Brooks Fiber more management information systems
(MIS) capabilities, improving its ability to meet interexchange
carrier (IXC) customers' service requirements, Mr. Allen said. 
IXCs have "voiced perpetual disappointment with MIS shortcomings
of the older [local exchange carriers]," he added.  Brooks Fiber
now will have about 300 employees and could have revenues of more
than $40 million in 1996, it said.

S.C. COMMISSION ORDERS BellSouth's PRICE CAPS

     In adopting a price cap plan for BellSouth
Telecommunications, Inc., the South Carolina Public Service
Commission properly has "recognized the need" for alternative
regulation of local exchange carriers, BellSouth says.  Greg
Morton, Director-corporate and external affairs in South
Carolina, told CBF, however, that a five-year "freeze" on basic
local service rates "is too long in a competitive environment." 
BellSouth had proposed a freeze for only three years.  

     Mr. Morton said BellSouth is "disappointed" that the PSC
included a 2.1% "productivity factor" in its recently adopted
price cap formula.  After the plan's fifth year, BellSouth will
be allowed to increase basic service rates by an amount equal to
the rate of inflation, minus the 2.1% productivity factor.  Its
intrastate switched access rates are capped for three years.  For
"nonbasic" (competitive and "discretionary," or optional)
services, BellSouth has pricing flexibility, subject to a 10%
annual limit on rate increases.  The PSC will maintain oversight
authority and can refuse to allow rate increases.

U S WEST EXCHANGE

     Pacific Telecom, Inc., has agreed to purchase 32 rural
Minnesota exchanges from U S WEST Communications, Inc., which
previously had announced that it would sell the exchanges to
another company, HTC Group.  

     That deal collapsed because of "a change of investment
priority on the part of HTC Group partners," according to a
statement issued jointly by all three companies.

     HTC still plans to acquire U S WEST exchanges in Iowa, and
the Bell company is negotiating with two or three other companies
to sell Nebraska exchanges, a U S WEST spokesman said.  Federal
and state regulatory approvals are needed before the exchanges
can be transferred.

AT&T TO SELL CIRCUIT BOARD PLANT IN RESTRUCTURING

     A retired AT&T Corp. executive has assembled an investment
team that plans to bid on the AT&T Microelectronics factory in
Richmond, Va., which is slated to be sold as part of the
company's streamlining and restructuring plan.  Hobart A. Weaver,
who helped start the Richmond Works printed circuit board factory
more than 20 years ago, told CBF Jan. 16 that he expects to
receive a sales proposal from AT&T within 60 days.  Mr. Weaver
said he has lined up New York investment bankers Peter Dixon and
Wilmer Thomas, with whom he has participated in several past
ventures, for bidding to acquire the plant.  He said he also
hopes to include the factory's almost 2,000 employees as
part-owners of a new public company.

     He said he informed AT&T last April that he was interested
in purchasing the plant.  Mr. Weaver, who retired from AT&T in
1982 as head of manufacturing operations in North Carolina, was
GM of the plant when it opened in 1973.  He said he has contacted
the Communications Workers of America local representing the
Richmond Works employees and expects the plant to remain a union
shop.  An AT&T spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Weaver's
plan, saying only that the company is "talking to several
potential buyers."

     The Richmond plant, which manufactures printed circuit
boards and "backplanes," has about 1,950 employees.  "We plan to
initiate discussions with potential buyers in the next few
weeks," said the unit's President, Curtis J. Crawford.  He said
the largest customer of the plant's products, AT&T Network
Systems, "expects to continue to depend upon the Richmond Works
as a major supplier after the sale."  CWA, which represents
nonmanagement employees at the plant, said, "We had just turned
the corner on making the plant profitable for the first time in a
long time, and this is the thanks we get."

     AT&T Microelectronics will become part of the systems and
technology company to be spun off from AT&T on Jan. 1, 1997.  A
spokesman for the unit said company planners see "no strategic
advantage in owning the factory. . .We find it makes more sense
to invest in some of our other businesses. . .Historically (we)
tended to make everything we needed," he said.  "But over the
years, we've reevaluated and asked whether we really need to be
making these [products] ourselves.  In the case of these circuit
boards, we decided we didn't."

ANALYSTS PRAISE PACIFIC BELL's NEW 'PRODUCTIVITY FACTOR'

     Rejecting requests to eliminate price cap regulation, the
California regulators have told Pacific Bell to freeze basic
local rates for at least three years.  They also adjusted Pacific
Bell's price cap "productivity factor."  Pacific Bell previously
was subject to a 5% factor.  The new factor is keyed to the rate
of inflation.

     John Gueldner, Pacific Bell VP-regulatory, said the action
"sends the right signal to companies based in California as well
as those considering investing here.  It will allow us to
continue investing in our California infrastructure and will
encourage economic growth and jobs throughout the state." 
Analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co. viewed the PUC's decision as
"positive" for Pacific Telesis Group.  The analysts kept their
1996 earnings-per-share estimate of $2.55.

     "Had the 5% productivity factor been maintained, the
required rate reductions in 1996 would have been about $63
million (net of miscellaneous price increases)," they noted. 
Because of increasing local exchange service competition, Pacific
Bell likely will use its "downward pricing flexibility" to reduce
rates "for those services likely to be most targeted by
competitors," offsetting "much of the $63 million cushion"
provided by the PUC's recent decision, they added.
