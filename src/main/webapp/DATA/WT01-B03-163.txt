<H3>How To Make Life Easier </H3>
<UL>
<LI><P>Recognize that there may be certain times of the day when you feel better and use that to your advantage. </P>
 
<LI><P>Break large tasks into smaller ones; set priorities and take things one at a time; avoid taking on too much responsibility and 
setting overly difficult goals. </P>
 
<LI><P>Try not to expect too much from yourself so as to lessen any feeling of failure you may have. </P>
 
<LI><P>Activities such as exercise, attending sports or cultural events or participating in a religious or social event can help you feel 
better. It is important not to overdo it; feeling better takes time. </P>
 
<LI><P>Avoid alcohol and non-prescribed drugs. This kind of self-medication may provide a temporary "high", but in the end 
will intensify depression. </P>
 
<LI><P>If affected with Depressive disorders, you may feel exhausted, worthless, helpless and hopeless. You may feel like giving up. It 
is important to realize that these symptoms and negative thinking are part of depression. When treatment begins to take effect, the 
negative thinking fades. </P>
