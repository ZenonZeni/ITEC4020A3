During 1994, approximately 100 volunteers served the Institute while working with researchers, clinicians, and administrative personnel. A number of these volunteers were students from a variety of clinical disciplines, such as Recreational Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and Social Work, who were completing internships under the supervision of Institute staff. The majority of volunteers, however, were people who wanted to contribute to the field of psychiatry as well as gain some invaluable experience for their future. In many cases, people who were dissatisfied with their present careers volunteered their service as a means of sampling a career in mental health.

Prospective volunteers were first interviewed by the Coordinator of Volunteer Services to determine what they may have to offer the Institute, and to determine what the Institute may have to offer them. A referral was then made to the appropriate department head or liaison. Areas that made regular use of volunteers during this period included several research projects, clinical units, and departments. Volunteers led diverse patient groups, such as Writers' Workshop, Crafts, and Computer Class.

Under the guidance of Dr. Jane Fried, Chairperson of the Infection Control Committee, efforts were made in 1994 to make the Institute a safer environment in which volunteers would work. Policy was initiated that required all prospective volunteers to attend orientation to Fire Safety and Infection Control procedures. They were also required to submit a physical health history that documented their TB status and history of vaccinations. No volunteer could be registered without having satisfied these requirements.
