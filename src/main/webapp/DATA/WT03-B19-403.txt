<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 204</TITLE>
<P>
<H1>Climate change<BR>
and the special concerns<BR>
of developing countries</H1>
<HR>
<B>The problems and priorities created by climate change are different for developing 
countries than for industrialized countries.</B> They have been outlined at numerous conferences 
specifically addressing the environmental concerns of developing countries. The priorities of 
developing countries vis a vis climate change have also been addressed at major political conferences, 
including the Ninth Conference of Heads of State of the Non-Aligned States,1 the Twentieth South 
Pacific Forum,2 and the Langkawi meeting of the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth,3 all 
held in 1989, and the Second Ministerial Conference of Developing Countries on Environment and 
Development, held in April 1992.4 Other statements, such as the Caracas Declaration of the Group of 
77,5 the Amazon Declaration,6 and the Declaration of Brasilia,7 did not directly address climate 
change, but they did highlight the general environmental concerns of developing countries.<P>
The declarations and statements adopted by developing-country confer-ences consistently feature the 
following four principles:<P>
<B>Principle 1: International cooperation on climate change is essential, but industrialized 
countries should  accept the main responsibility. </B>All nations must take action to minimize 
and respond to climate change and other environmental challenges. However, industrialized countries 
have been the leading cause of climate change. They also have greater financial and technological 
resources for responding to the problem. Consequently, industrialized countries must shoulder most 
of the burden. This principle is also known as <A HREF = "fs202.html">the 
principle of common but differentiated responsibility of states.</A><P>
<B>Principle 2: Industrialized countries should transfer funds and technology to help 
developing countries respond to climate change.</B> Due to both geography and poverty, 
developing countries are more vulnerable to the likely impacts of climate change. Arid regions and <A 
HREF = "fs203.html">low-lying coastal and island states</A> are at the 
greatest risk. Given their superior resources and their role in causing climate change, industrialized 
countries should help poorer countries. They should transfer environmentally sound technologies on 
preferential, non-commercial terms. They should also contribute additional funds, over and beyond 
existing development aid, so that developing countries can better respond to the negative impacts of 
climate change.<P>
<B>Principle 3: Sustainable development strategies can alleviate poverty while minimizing 
environmental damage</B>. In developing countries, poverty is a leading cause of environmental 
degradation. Short-term economic development remains a more pressing concern for poor countries 
than long-term environmental protection. Measures to address environmental problems such as 
climate change must take this into account by promoting sustainable development. International 
action on climate change must not interfere with the sovereign right of states to exploit their own 
natural resources.<P>
<B>Principle 4: Climate negotiations require the full involvement of developing countries.</B> 
Because climate change is a global issue, <I>all</I> states of the world must participate in the 
negotiations. Funds must be made available on a bilateral or multilateral basis to ensure that 
developing countries are able to participate fully in international climate change negotiations. <P>
<B>These four principles strongly influenced the Climate Convention negotiations . . . 
</B>Repeated consistently in statements adopted by developing country conferences, these principles 
reflect a consensus among developing countries. They were also addressed in conferences with 
universal participation and by the <A HREF = "fs206.html">United Nations 
General Assembly.</A>8 The needs and concerns of developing countries received special attention 
during the <A HREF = "fs209.html">Climate Convention negotiations</A> 
and special funds were established to finance the participation of developing country respresentatives.  
The INC accepted that states should take action based on their common but differentiated 
responsibilities and respective capabilities". While industrialized countries also recognized the need 
for offering financial and technical assistance, there was disagreement among the Convention 
negotiators over terms for technology transfer and the levels and mechanisms of funding.<P>
<B>and were to a large extent incorporated into the 1992 <A HREF = 
"fs250.html">UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</A> 
</B> In accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, 
the Climate Convention establishes different levels of commitment for developed and developing 
countries. It recognizes the need for sustainable development and requires developed states to 
provide new and additional funds to developing countries. It also  encourages the transfer of 
technology, although there is no commitment regarding preferential and non-commercial terms. The 
Convention defines a financial mechanism to administer funding and technology transfer. The Global 
Environment Facility (GEF) was entrusted with the operation of this mechanism on an interim 
basis.<P>
