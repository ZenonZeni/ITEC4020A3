<B>The Government Relations Committee </B>is supported by the National Association of Metal Finishers, The Metal Finishing Suppliers' Association and the American Electroplaters and Surface Finishers Society. It works as a liaison between the associations and their lobbying organizations and government representatives. 
<P>

Recently, the Government Relations Staff sent out a memo on what 
has been happening in Washington with certain issues. The industry has been active in the current debate on the <B>Clean Water Act 
Reauthorization</B>. Industry involvement resulted in passage of  House Rule 961 in May, 1995, and efforts continue to have the Senate pass a similar bill. 
<P>

<B>Superfund Reform</B> is among the top items on the congressional agenda for the coming year. House Rule 2500 reflects many of the principles supported by the industry, particularly in cleanup standards. However, changes that repeal retroactive liability at multi-party sites are expected and welcomed. <P> 

Some representatives have drafted a narrow bill that makes 
technical corrections to the <B>Clean Air Act Amendments of 
1990.</B> Issues addressed may include reforms to vehicle inspection maintenance, employee trip reductions, Title V permitting and enhanced or compliance assurance. NAMF has 
signed an industry letter supporting the legislation. 
<P>

The NAMF  has endorsed H.R. 2335, a limited bill to amend 
the<B> Solid Waste Disposal Act</B> to exempt materials reused in industrial processes 
from the definition of solid waste. The House is expected to vote on this in Spring 1996. 
<P>   

Industry is preparing comments on Phase I of the 
<B>Metal Products and Machinery Effluent Guidelines 
Proposal</B> (MP&amp;M). Many major industries (aerospace, electronics) and companies provided comments and 
financial assistance in preparing this commentary. The EPA is considering combining MP&amp;M Phase I and Phase II, which would mean that the rule would take longer to complete. 
<P>

In mid-December 1995, EPA, under pressure from Government 
Relations, published a five-year deferral and proposal to permanently exempt decorative chromium electroplaters from <B>Clean Air Act Title V</B>permitting requirements. 
<P><B>OSHA</B>is considering lowering the chromium permissible exposure limit (PEL) from 100 mg/cu meter to 0.5 to 1 mg/cu meter. Government Relations is working with the Chrome Coalition to develop a response strategy. 
<P>

In addition to funding from the Associations, the Government 
Relations Committee also needs your input and support: supplying data, writing to your representatives, attending hearings, letting the Government Relations Committee know your position on issues. Contact Bill Sonntag or Victoria Shaw at 202-333-2424. <B>PF</B>
