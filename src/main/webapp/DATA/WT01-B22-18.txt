<h2>History of Tobacco Regulation* </h2>

<p><b>*This section is based in part on a paper prepared for the
Commission by Jane Lang McGrew, an attorney from Washington, D.C.
<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p>Since 1613, when John Rolfe introduced a successful experiment
in tobacco cultivation in Virginia (Morison, 1965 : 52) the leaf
has assumed major social, industrial, economic and medical
implications. Consequently, persons concerned with tobacco on a
commercial or personal basis have been subject to a variety of
different regulations over the past 360 years.<br>
</p>

<p>Tobacco has been attacked by social observers and medical
authorities for the damage it has allegedly done, to the social
and physical condition of man. Yet it has also provided a
substantial source of revenue to the state and Federal
governments of the United States. </p>

<p>As is now the case with alcohol, tobacco has long been subject
to regulatory controls over the quantity and quality of
production. On the other hand, sumptuary laws affecting tobacco
have been far fewer-and weaker-than those aimed at alcohol. In
fact, there has never been a time when tobacco was prohibited
throughout the United States although consumption under certain
circumstances has been forbidden at various times in different
jurisdictions. </p>

<p>Tobacco-associated today with smoking of cigarettes, and to a
lesser extent, of pipes and cigars-has been popular at times for
both snuffing and chewing. Indeed, until about 1870 cigarettes
were relatively rare in the United States, and almost all tobacco
consumed domestically was chewed during the mid-19th century
(Gottsegen, 1940: 9-10). </p>

<p>What ever the preferred mode of consumption, however, the,
commodity has always been the subject of debate respecting the
appropriate governmental attitude. On the one hand, proponents of
the leaf stress its social benefits and its economic and
industrial significance. Some enthusiasts even endorse its
alleged medical and psychological benefits. Opposed are those who
cite the health hazards of smoking and others who are convinced
of its immorality.<br>
</p>

<p>The motivation for regulation has come from both sides of the
controversy. Most sumptuary restrictions were fostered by the
latter group in an effort to suppress the habit. Those who seek
to institutionalize and foster use of the drug focus on the
regulation of the quantity and quality of production.<br>
</p>

<p>This section does not attempt to weigh the merits of the
various regulatory schemes. Rather, it will trace from John
Rolfe's day the three threads of regulation which have
circumscribed both the producer and consumer of tobacco in the
United States.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>REGULATION OF PRODUCTION<br>
</b></p>

<p>In the opinion of King James I of England, tobacco was
&quot;loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the
brain&quot; and &quot;dangerous to the lungs&quot; (Middleton,
1953: 93). Whether the King was prescient, or simply sensitive,
was irrelevant in the 17th and 18th centuries, however, for
tobacco rapidly became the mainstay of the Maryland and Virginia
economics. Within seven years of John Rolfe's first imaginative
experiment,, Virginia exported nothing but tobacco and a little
sassafrass to England (Middleton, 1953: 93-94). Almost as
quickly, the leaf became the staple of the colony of Maryland and
competition developed in Carolina as well.<br>
</p>

<p>In Massachusetts Bay, the product fared less well. The first
general letter (April 17,1629) from an official of the New
England Company to the Massachusetts Bay settlers prohibited the
planting of tobacco except in small quantities for medicinal
purposes (Werner, 1922: 100). Next door in Connecticut, however,
the colonists attempted to rival the southern planters with a
local leaf. Indeed, the infant industry was coddled by the
protectionist General Court at New Haven, which promulgated a
rule in 1641 that: </p>

<p><i>No persons within this jurisdiction shall [smoke] any other
Tobacco but such as is or shall be planted within these
[districts], except they have license from the Courte </i>(Tobacco
Institute, Connecticut, undated: 20).<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the royal attitude and the fear of certain
patent holders of the London Company that Virginia had become a
&quot;colony founded on smoke&quot; (Tobacco Institute,,
Virginia, 1971 : 19; Middleton, 1953: 94), England encouraged the
growth of the tobacco industry. Monopolies to import tobacco from
the colonies were granted by the Crown to court favorites who
soon prospered as a result of this trade. </p>

<p>In 1621, a bill was introduced which, according to one
contemporary commentator, was &quot;extremely remarkable&quot;:
No tobacco was to be imported after the 1st of October, 1621,
except from Virginia and Bermuda; and, after that day, none was
to be planted in England. Although the act was initially defeated
by the House of Lords, James I in 1922 himself granted the import
monopoly to the Virginia and Bermuda, companies and prohibited
the domestic cultivation of tobacco (Brooks, 1952: 88). </p>

<p>The system worked well for the British importers, but the
methods of financing they employed became onerous to the colonial
planters. The tobacco was marketed by consignment to an English
merchant who deposited the proceeds of the sale to the planters'
accounts. Often, however, the high commissions charged and the
cost, of goods ordered by the Virginians in payment for their
crop contributed to the growth of colonial indebtedness. The
extension of credit to cover the deficiencies caused the debts to
grow constantly, but the only alternative to the consignment
system was to sell the product in the colony at a lower price
(Middleton, 1953: 104-107). </p>

<p>Industrial competition in this market provided the impulse for
certain regulatory relief. Importation of the Carolinian product
into Virginia was forbidden by an act of 1679, amended in 1726 to
prohibit importation by land as well as by sea. Nor was North
Carolina permitted to export its tobacco from Virginia ports. In
Great Britain, the Privy Council looked with disfavor upon such
colonial legislation which threatened the financial well-being of
the merchants and so disallowed the Virginia Act in 1731
(Middleton, 1953: 114-115). </p>

<p>Competition similarly induced both Virginia and Maryland to
enact laws prescribing the dimensions of the hogshead in which
tobacco was packaged in 1658. Vying for purchasers, the two
colonies gradually enlarged the statutory size of the hogshead
until, under edict from the Privy Council in Britain, Maryland
was ordered to pass a gauge act establishing the size of the
hogshead in the same dimensions as those fixed in Virginia. </p>

<p>Notwithstanding such legislation, however, the manufacture of
hogsheads was still characterized by carelessness and
irregularity until the warehouse inspection system went into
effect in the 18th century (Middleton, 1953: 116-117). </p>

<p>It was not long before the colonial planters were faced with a
more serious problem-overproduction-which was causing a decline
in prices as well as quality of the leaf. In 1619, the first
tobacco inspection law was passed by the Virginia House of
Burgesses, ordering the lowest grade of tobacco to be destroyed
and prohibiting &quot;second growth&quot; tobacco and the
marketing of trash leaves. </p>

<p>This act was followed in 1621 by a more direct attempt to
restrict production. Each cultivator was required to limit his
growth to 1000 plants of nine leaves each. Although this order
was soon rescinded as a patent failure, an act of 1629 permitted
each planter to tend only 3000 plants with an additional
allowance of 1000 for non-laboring 'women and each child (Brooks,
1952: 96).<br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the statutory effort, the problem intensified.
Virginia attempted to encourage the other tobacco colonies to
reach agreements restricting plantings, but in Maryland, Lord
Baltimore resisted. If planters were poor, he asserted: </p>

<p><i>It is not from the low price of Tobacco, but from their
owne sloth, ill husbandry and profusely spending their croppe in
Brandewine, and other liquors </i>(Robert, 1949: 11).<br>
</p>

<p>Carolina, Maryland and Virginia actually reached a decision to
prohibit the planting of the staple from. February 1667 to
February 1668. This &quot;stint&quot; proved a less effective
means of control than the winds of 1667, which almost destroyed
the, crop ready for harvest that year (Tobacco Institute,
Virginia, 1971: 19). </p>

<p>Acts of God failed to provide an ultimate solution, however,
and severe economic dislocation in Maryland and Virginia
intensified. By 1681, the Virginia governor, Lord Culpeper,
complained:<br>
</p>

<p><i>... [T]hat which is more to us than all other things put
together, and will be the speedy and certain ruin of the colony,
is the low price of tobacco. The thing is so fatal and desperate
that there is no remedy; the market is overstocked and every crop
overstocks it more. It is commonly said that there is tobacco
enough now in London to last all England for five years.... Our
thriving is our undoing, and our purchase of negroes, by
increasing the supply of tobacco, has greatly contributed thereto</i>
(Brooks, 1952: 112-113).<br>
</p>

<p>The failure of the Virginia Assembly to pass another act
requiring a &quot;stint&quot;' led the so-called &quot;cutters
and pluckers&quot; to take the matter into their own hands in
1682 by burning both their own crops and the plants of their
neighbors (Roberts, 1949: 11). The riot stimulated legislative
action in 1684 of a less helpful sort: the destruction of tobacco
was made a criminal offense,, subject to the death penalty
(Brooks, 1952: 12). </p>

<p>Seventeenth century quality control laws proved no more
successful in the effort to relieve the depression of the
industry. Renewed efforts were made in early years of the next
century, however. </p>

<p>In 1713, the Virginia House of Burgesses established a
warehouse system to enforce tobacco inspection. Forty public
warehouses were created. Strong opposition to the system led the
Privy Council to disallow the act In 1717, but the ensuing
depression of the 1720's was convincing evidence of the need for
relief. Accordingly, the system was reinstated with British
approval in 1730, cornplete with public warehouses and official
inspectors (Middleton, 1953: 120-121). </p>

<p>The apparent success of the system appealed to Maryland,
suffering also from a surfeit of tobacco. &quot;Tobacco, our
money, is worth nothing wrote one Marylander in 1724, &quot;'and
[there is] not a Shirt to be had for Tobacco this year in all our
country&quot; (Tobacco Institute, Maryland, 1971: 21). </p>

<p>Tobacco riots ensued when the Mary] and Assembly initially
refused to follow Virginia's example. One individual was moved to
inform Lord Baltimore that no improvement in the economic state
of the colony was possible until inspection laws were passed that
&quot;will prevent the sending to Market Such trash as is unfit
for any other use but Manure&quot; (Tobacco Institute,,,
Maryland, 1971: 23). Accordingly, Maryland followed Virginia in
the creation of an inspection system in 1747,and Carolina did
likewise in 1754 (Brooks, 1952: 165). </p>

<p>Tobacco entirely dominated the economic and social structure
of Virginia and Maryland. &quot;Tobacco requires us to abhor
communities or townships,&quot; wrote a 17th century governor of
Maryland, &quot;since a planter cannot carry on his affairs
without considerable elbow room within his plantation&quot;
(Brooks, 1952: 98). </p>

<p>In Virginia, tobacco had gained such ascendancy that it was
used as money. For example, when, in 1621, a cargo of twelve
young women made its way to the colony, each one was valued at
120 pounds of the best leaf (Brooks, 1952: 93). By law,
Virginia's ministers were paid in tobacco at 16,000 pounds
annually in 1696. The law provided that: </p>

<p><i>A competent and sufficient provision for the clergy will be
the only means to supply this dominion with able and faithful
Ministers whereby the glory of God may be advanced,the church
propagated, and the people edified </i>(Werner, 1922: 102).<br>
</p>

<p>Not until the Option Act was passed by the Virginia Assembly
in 1755 could the clergy's fees be paid in either money or
tobacco (Brooks, 1952: 167). </p>

<p>The regulation of tobacco in the colonies was devised in
response to the industry with the intent to further the
prosperity of the planters who dominated the economy. This theme
continued to pervade all related regulatory efforts in the
tobacco-producing states thereafter, as new practices developed
in the marketing of the leaf. </p>

<p>The initial hogshead inspection system gradually gave way to
the sale of loose-leaf tobacco by auction. In 1849 the Virginia
Code recognized these methods in lieu of the sale of hogsheads of
the leaf as provided in the 1730 Act. By 1865, the tobacco
auction had completely replaced the earlier marketing techniques
in Virginia (Tobacco Institute, Virginia, 1971: 28-29). </p>

<p>More than a half century later Maryland followed suit. In
1939, the loose-leaf auction warehouse system was introduced to
replace the hogshead system, and the conversion occurred almost
overnight. The practices engaged in are regulated by the Maryland
State Tobacco Authority, established in 1947 by law. The
Authority itself is supervised by eight representatives selected
by the Governor from the producing counties, the University of
Maryland, the buyers and the sellers (Tobacco Institute,
Maryland, 1971: 9-10). </p>

<p>The Federal Government came to recognize the significance of
the tobacco industry in response to state pressures. Accordingly,
since 1930, several bills have been enacted to aid the growers. </p>

<p>Enacted in 1935, the Tobacco Inspection Act directs the
Secretary of Agriculture to establish quality standards and to
designate auction markets (7 U.S.C. 511 (b) and (d)). The
following year, the Tobacco Control Act was passed, bestowing
Congressional approval upon state compacts which regulate the
production of tobacco, and subsidizing the expenses of the state
commissions involved (7 U.S.C. 515). Thus, the two elements of
initial colonial regulation were preserved: the encouragement of
quality and the discouragement of quantity. </p>

<p>The latter objective was further implemented by the
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938. Since that time, parity
payments have been made to tobacco producers: </p>

<p><i>In amounts which, together with the proceeds thereof, will
provide a return to such producers which is as nearly equal to
parity price as the funds so made available will permit </i>(7
U.S.C. 1303). <br>
</p>

<p>In addition, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to set
national marketing quotas respecting each kind of tobacco (7
U.S.C. 1312), to apportion the quotas among the states, and to
allot the portions among the farms (7 U.S.C. 1314). Penalties are
imposed for overproduction (7 U.S.C. 1314). </p>

<p>There is nothing subtle about these measures, of course. Their
intent is obvious: to assure the economic stability of an
industry which, as of 1960, provided the United States population
with more than 150,000,000 pounds of manufactured tobacco for
consumption annually (Heimann, 1960: 93), and which provided more
than $4.8 billion in taxes in 1971 (USDA, Tobacco Situation,
1971b: 44). </p>

<p>During the same year, growers' gross receipts reached about
$900 million (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 2), while cigarette
sales alone grossed for the manufacturer and seller approximately
$5 billion (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 53). The commercial
motivation is sound enough if considered abstractly. When
combined with the revenue incentive, however, it has largely
obscured sumptuary controls.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>REGULATION FOR REVENUE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton's tax package of 1794 proposed the first
federal excise taxes upon tobacco products. To the distress of
Philadelphia snuff manufacturers (Brooks, 1952: 146), however,
the tax was restricted after serious Congressional debate to
their product only. </p>

<p>James Madison led the opposition to a general tobacco tax; his
views were summarized in the Annals of Congress on May 2, 1794: </p>

<p><i>As to the subject before the House, it was proper to choose
taxes the least unequal. Tobacco excise was a burden the most
unequal. It fell upon the poor, upon the sailors, day-laborers,
and other people of these classes, while the rich will often
escape it</i> (Robert, 1949: 100). </p>

<p>The legislative decision was probably tempered as well by
considerations of the enforceability of the measure: snuff had to
be manufactured, while quid and pipe tobacco were often homegrown
leaf at the time (Heimann, 1960: 155). In any case, the snuff
bill was ultimately enacted, modified, suspended and repealed,
with small, if any, effect upon federal revenues. </p>

<p>The opportunity to distill tax money from tobacco was seized
upon more vigorously at the time of the Civil War. On July 1,
1862, an ad valorem tax was imposed upon cigars for the first
time. This tax was raised two years later when a separate tax
upon cigarettes was also imposed (Werner, 1922: 358). (Even the
Confederacy sought to levy a tax-in-kind upon tobacco crops, but
was precluded from doing so by the inspection system which
required the inspector to deliver the full amount of tobacco
specified in the warehouse receipt (Robert, 1949: 117).) </p>

<p>Thereafter, the taxes were raised in 1865, 1866 and 1875. A
temporary reduction followed, until the Spanish-American War
necessitated further increases. Concurrently, taxes were levied
upon smoking and manufactured tobacco and snuff, lest the burden
fall unequally upon smokers (Werner, 1922: 559). </p>

<p>By 1880, the tobacco taxes bad largely stabilized. At that
time, they accounted for 31% of total federal tax receipts, or
$38.9 million. Of this, 50% of the collections was derived from
smoking and chewing tobacco, 40% from cigars and cheroots, and
less than 2% from cigarettes (Heimann, 1960: 156). </p>

<p>Since that time, federal tax collections on tobacco products
have risen almost annually. Between 1910 and 1920, they increased
more than 500%, the greatest increase in any single decade. By
1970, they accounted for almost $2.1 billion, down slightly from
the two preceding years (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 5). </p>

<p>Indicative of changing patterns of consumption, the taxes on
cigarettes, as a percentage of the total federal tobacco revenue
jumped from 13.6% in 1910 to 51.1% in 1920. By 1970, the
percentage at 97.2% far outdistanced those revenues derived from
other forms of the product (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 5). </p>

<p>Excise taxes have proved profitable and easy to collect. The
revenue schemes are simple on both the federal (26 U.S.C. 5701 et
seq.) and state levels. In the past, no justification for them
has been deemed necessary since Madison's protest. No elaborate
licensing or state monopoly system, such as those designed to
control commerce in alcohol, has ever been imposed.<br>
</p>

<p>In 1921, Iowa became the first state to cash in on the crop
directly by taxing cigarettes. By 1930, 11 other states had
adopted the revenue measure (Robert, 1949: 256). </p>

<p>In 1950, 40 states and the District of Columbia taxed
cigarettes. The rates ranged from one cent to five cents for a
pack of 20 except in Louisiana which levied an eight cent tax on
cigarettes. In 1958, Montana imposed an equivalent rate. </p>

<p>Between 1950 and 1962, 43 of the 47 taxing states raised their
rates at least once. The frequent increase in cigarette taxes
narrowed the gap between the rates in low tax states and higher
tax states. In the 12-year period, the median tax rate rose from
three cents to six cents per pack (Federal Trade Commission,
1970: 3) ; the maximum rate remained at eight cents in Texas,
Louisiana, Montana and New Mexico, in contrast to the two cent
rate in the District of Columbia and Kentucky. </p>

<p>The four leading states in terms of both production and
relative dependence on the crop have been North Carolina, South
Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia, the latter two being the only
states in the history of cigarette taxation to decrease their
taxes; the reduction was only .5 cent (from three cents to two
and a half cents) in 1960 and 1961, respectively.<br>
</p>

<p>By 1966, Oregon became the 49th state to impose a tax on
cigarettes; the rate was four cents per pack. Finally, in 1969
North Carolina imposed a cigarette tax-two cents. </p>

<p>The cigarette excise taxes continued to increase during the
sixties. By 1970, the taxes ranged from North Carolina's two
cents to Pennsylvania's 18 cents for a weighted average of 10.7
cents. Twenty nine states levied taxes of 10 cents or more per
pack (USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971b: 40). Local governments
superimposed further excise taxes on the state taxes, ranging
from one cent to 10 cents per package (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970:
iv). </p>

<p>By mid-1971, the range had widened further Connecticut at 21
cents and North Carolina at two cents, the weighted average state
tax being 11.1 cents (USDA, Tobacco Situation , 1971a: 7).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>TOBACCO REVENUES<br>
</b></p>

<p>A peculiar relationship exists between production and revenue.
In 1970, cash receipts from tobacco brought in $11 million for
Pennsylvania; tobacco farmers and cigarette taxes amassed $194.6
million for the state. By comparison growers in North Carolina
collected $576 million while the state collected only $13.4
million in cigarette revenues (USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971b:
43). </p>

<p>The federal excise tax on a package of cigarettes is currently
eight cents and has remained so since 1951. The combined state
and federal tax was highest in Pennsylvania; 26 cents for 20
cigarettes, which was 58.2% of the retail price. Connecticut's 24
cents and Texas's 23.5 cents were close behind; the average for
the United States was 46.8%. </p>

<p>To the Federal and state governments today, tobacco is a
financial asset. The total federal and state revenue collected f
rom all tobacco products in 1971 amounted to over $4.7 billion.
Local governments excised the product further bringing the sum
total to $4.8 million (USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971b: 44). </p>

<p>From the years 1890 to 1930 cigarette tax collections from
tobacco soared from approximately $1 million to over $339
million. By 1950, they exceeded $1.2 billion. </p>

<p>Totals for the years 1890 to 1970 are recorded in the
following chart (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 5)<br>

<p><b>REGULATION OF CONSUMPTION<br>
</b></p>

<p>Even as far back as the 16th century, smoking was considered
to have medicinal value. Juan de Cardenas, a Spanish physician
who lived in Mexico in the late 1500's, wrote that &quot;Soldiers
subject to privations, kept off cold, hunger, thirst by smoking
and all the inhabitants of the hot countries of the Indies
alleviate their discomforts by the smoke of this blessed and
medicinal weed&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 63-64). </p>

<p>During, the recurrent epidemics of plague in the 17th century,
it was widely believed that smokers were spared; it has been
reported that men who attended the sick and accompanied the dead
kept their pipes lit (Wagner, 1971: 63-64). </p>

<p>In 1614, one Scottish doctor praised the tobacco plant which: </p>

<p><i>Prepareth the stomach for meat; it maketh a clear voice: it
maketh a sweet breath . . . in a few words it is the princess of
physical plants</i> (Gottsegen, 1940: 87).<br>
</p>

<p>King James disagreed strenuously, and in 1604 ordered a
substantial increase in the import duty on the leaf. Smoking, he
wrote in &quot;A Counterblaste to Tobacco&quot;, is: </p>

<p><i>A custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful
to the brain, dangerous to the lungs, and in the black stinking
fume thereof, nearest resembling the horrible Stygian smoke of
the pit that is bottomless</i> (Brooks, 1952:56, 71). </p>

<p>Another more passionate moralist wrote: </p>

<p>.<i> . . imagine thou beheldest here a firme-sucker's wife
most fearfully fuming forth very fountains of blood, howling for
anguish of heart, weeping, wailing, and wringing her hands
together . . . while she _pitifully pleads with her husband thus:
Oh husband, my husband . . . ! Why dost thou so vainly prefer a
vanishing filthy fume before my permanent virtues? </i>(Brooks,
1952: 72). <br>
</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such alliterative literature, the habit of
smoking increased in popularity, particularly in the colonies. A
French visitor observed in 1686 that: </p>

<p><i>Large quantities of it [tobacco] are used in this country,
besides what they sell. Everyone smokes while working and idling.
I sometimes went to hear the sermon; their churches are in the
woods, and when everyone has arrived the minister and all the
others smoke before going in. The preaching over, they do the
same thing before parting. They have seats for that purpose. It
was here I saw that everybody smokes, men, women, girls and boys
from the age of seven years </i>(Robert, 1949: 99).<br>
</p>

<p>It was said that even in New England, women of the colony
&quot;smoke in bed, smoke as they knead their bread, smoke whilst
they're cooking&quot; (Gottsegen, 1940: 147). </p>

<p>In the tobacco colonies, of course, there was no attempt to
restrict Consumption of tobacco. It was, after all, their
economic mainstay. </p>

<p>Officials in the northern colonies were less enthusiastic
about the habit, however. In 1632, the General Court of
Massachusetts Bay took the initiative and forbade smoking in
public tinder penalty of a fine (Tobacco Institute,
Massachusetts, 1971 : 17). In 1638, the proscription was expanded
to prohibit anyone from smoking in any inn or public house except
in his own room &quot;so as neither the master of the house nor
any of the guests there shall take offense thereat which if they
do, then such person is forthwith to forebear upon paying of two
shillings sixpence fine for every offense&quot; (Werner, 1922:
100). </p>

<p>This law was followed by another in 1646 which prohibited
smoking except on a journey of five miles or more from any town.
Nor could a citizen of the colony bring a pipe or tobacco into
the precincts of the court (Werner, 1922: 100), although he might
smoke at &quot;the ordinary tyme of repast comonly called
dynner&quot; (Heimann, 1960: 83).<br>
</p>

<p>Plymouth colony was similarly strict. In 1638, a law was
passed forbidding anyone from smoking on the streets. The
following year, it was decreed that jurymen might not smoke, on
pain of a five shilling penalty. </p>

<p>In 1641, even the importation of tobacco was forbidden,
although the law was repealed a year later. A law passed in 1646
prohibited all from smoking, but exempted &quot;soldiers in time
of their training.&quot; And, finally, in 1669, it was ordered
that anyone found smoking on the Sabbath within two miles of a
meeting house, would be fined 12 pence (Werner, 1922: 101). </p>

<p>The colony at New Haven, Connecticut, essayed a like series of
statutes to regulate tobacco consumption. In 1646, the General
Court decreed that: </p>

<p><i>No person under the age of twenty years nor any other that
hath not already accustomed himself to the use thereof, shall
take any tobacko, until he hath brough a certificate under the
hands of [a physician] that it is usefull for him, and also, that
he hath received a license from the court for the same.... None
shall take any tobacko, publickly in the street or any open
places unless on a journey of at least ten miles.</i> (Tobacco
Institute, Connecticut: 20-21).<br>
</p>

<p>Within three years those laws were repealed (Werner, 1922:
102). However, it was further ordered in 1655 that: </p>

<p><i>No tobacco shall be taken in the streets, yards or aboute
the howses in any plantation or farme in this jurisdiction
without dores, neere or aboute the towne, or in the meeting
howse, or body of the trayne Souldiors, or any other place where
they may doe mischief thereby, under the penalty of 84 pence a
pipe for a time, wch is to goe to him that informs and prosecuts </i>(Heimann,
1960: 83).<br>
</p>

<p>As a result of the regulation, snooping became a profitable
undertaking. In the end, however, the laws were of no avail in
suppressing tobacco. </p>

<p>By 1680, the governor of Connecticut recognized the
significance of the leaf and reported that, &quot;We have no need
of Virginia's trade, most people planting so much Tobacco as they
spend,&quot; (Heimann, 1960: 84). Indeed, by the early 18th
century, New England-grown tobacco was being produced in great
enough quantity for both domestic consumption and export (Tobacco
Institute, Connecticut: 22-23). <br>
</p>

<p>Tobacco was not one of the major concerns of the 18th century
either before or after the Revolution. Social reform was
generally secondary to political issues. By the end of the
century, however, Dr. Benjamin Rush had published his
&quot;Observations upon the influence of the Habitual use of
Tobacco upon Health, Morals, and Property&quot; in his collection
of Essays, Literary, Moral and Philosophical. It appeared in
1798, and stressed the Doctor's thesis that smoking and chewing
provoked drunkenness:<br>
</p>

<p><i>One of the usual effects of smoking and chewing is thirst.
This thirst cannot be allayed by water, for no sedative or even
insipid liquor will be relished after the mouth and throat have
been exposed to the stimulus of the smoke, or juice of Tobacco. A
desire of course is excited for strong drinks, and these when
taken between meals soon lead to intemperance and drunkenness.
One of the greatest sots I ever knew, acquired a love for ardent
spirits by swallowing ends of Tobacco, which he, (lid, to escape
detection in the use of it. . . </i>(Robert, 1949: 106).<br>
</p>

<p>There was little immediate response to Rush's dire warnings,
although in the year his tract was published, Boston enacted a
statute to prohibit the carrying of a lighted pipe or cigar in
public streets-apparently with the intent to reduce the hazard of
fire (Brooks, 1952: 245). </p>

<p>An anti-tobacco crusade was launched in the 19th century,
although with considerably less fervor that its sister movement
against alcohol. Among the leaders were Rev. George Trask who
said tobacco and alcohol were Satan's twins; and the Rev. Orin
Fowler, who declared in 1833: &quot;Rum-drinking will not cease,,
till tobacco-chewing and tobacco smoking and snuff -taking shall
cease&quot; (Robert, 1949: 107). Another, Dr. Joel Shew,
attributed delirium tremens, perverted sexuality, impotency,
insanity and cancer to the effects of smoking and chewing
(Brooks, 1952: 219). </p>

<p>The crusade warned as the pipe continued to attract adherents.
From the 18th century on, the cigar too began to grow in favor,
particularly after 1840. It is estimated that by 1850, the
average number of cigars smoked was approximately 19 per capita.
Within 10 years, the number had increased to about 26 (Gottsegen,
1940: 8-10). </p>

<p>Women smoked and chewed as well as the men. Indeed, Mrs.
Andrew Jackson and Mrs. Zachary Taylor both smoked their pipes in
the White House (Heimann, 1960: 90). And, of course, the other
residents of the Capital engaged heavily in the practices of both
chewing and spitting, to the extent that Charles Dickens, during
his tour of the States, felt called upon to report that:<br>
</p>

<p><i>Washington may be called the headquarters of
tobaccotinctured saliva.... In all the public places of America,
this filthy custom is recognized. In the courts of law, the judge
has his spittoon, the crier his, the witness his, and the
prisoner his; while the jurymen and spectators are provided for.
. . . The stranger will find [the custom] in its full bloom of
glory, luxuriant in all its alarming recklessness, at Washington </i>(Brooks,
1952: 215-216). <br>
</p>

<p>Chewing and snuffing remained popular until the time of the
Civil War. Thereafter, cigarette smoking was gradually adopted in
North America, a habit indirectly acquired through the British
from their Turkish and French allies during the Crimean War
(Werner, 1922: 105). </p>

<p>By 1870, approximately 13.9 million cigarettes were smoked
annually in the United States, or .36 per capita. Over the next
60 years, the number was to reach 976.91 per capita (Gottsegen,
1940: 28). </p>

<p>As more persons took to cigarettes, the zeal of reformers,
which had ebbed during the Civil War, was renewed. Pamphlets,
like those of the Temperance Movement, were published, urging
abstinence from smoking: </p>

<p><i>&quot;I'll never use tobacco, no;</i> </p>

<p><i>It is a filthy weed;</i> </p>

<p><i>I'll never put it in my mouth.&quot;</i> </p>

<p><i>Said Little Robert Reed.</i> </p>

<p><i>&quot;It hurts the health ; it makes bad breath;</i> </p>

<p><i>'Til very bad indeed.</i> </p>

<p><i>I'll never, never use it, no!&quot;</i> </p>

<p><i>Said Little Robert Reed </i>(Brooks, 1952: 242-243).<br>
</p>

<p>During the period following the Civil War and prior to the
formation of the American Tobacco Company in 1890, the
anti-liquor forces continued to snipe at tobacco in all forms. A
reformed drinker and temperance lecturer, John B. Gough, would
pull from his pocket a square of tobacco, smell it as if it were
a rose, cry out &quot;Ali you black devil, I love-you&quot; and
throw it away. </p>

<p>The anti-tobacconists were led by Lucy Gaston, the greatest,
warrior in the anti -cigarette campaign who was trained in the
office of the Women's Christian Temperance Union and then moved
over into the anti-tobacco Movement in the 1890's. Miss Gaston
encouraged children to wear anti-tobacco pins or buttons and
organized armies of children to sing and preach to and against
their smoking elders (Wagner, 1971: 40). </p>

<p>&quot;All hostility to tobacco seems nowadays to be
concentrated on cigarettes,&quot; noted Harper's Weekly,
observing the scene in 1905 (Robert, 1949: 169). It was scarcely
a startling revelation. Twenty years earlier, the New York Times
editorialized that: <br>
</p>

<p><i>A grown man has no possible excuse for thus imitating the
small boy.... The decadence of Spain began when the Spaniards
adopted cigarettes and if this pernicious habit obtains among
adult Americans the ruin of the Republic is close at hand . . . </i>(Brooks,
1952: 253).<br>
</p>

<p>Miss Gaston witnessed some legislation victories. Between 1895
and 1921, 14 states banned the sale of cigarettes (Neuberger,
1963: 52). Even in the city of New York it was declared unlawful
for women to smoke in public (Brooks, 1952: 271). Curiously,
However, the city of Boston repealed its law which prohibited
smoking in public in 1880 (Gottsegen, 1940: 153). </p>

<p>The apparent success of the prohibitionists revived the
anti-tobacconists' enthusiasm. &quot;Prohibition is won; now for
tobacco!&quot; pledged Billy Sunday. Miss Gaston also renewed her
dedication and actually announced her candidacy for the
presidency of the United States in 1920 on an antitobacco
platform. </p>

<p>For many anti-tobacconists, when it became apparent that the
elder generation may be lost, the war against tobacco was focused
on the youth of the country. The National Education Association
pledged its membership to cooperate in efforts made in the city,
state and nation to safeguard the health and morals of youth from
cigarette smoking to the end that high ideals for American
manhood may be, preserved for the coming generation (Hamilton,
1927: 168). </p>

<p>The National Congress of PTA, in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1926
resolved &quot;to lend its force to the cause of eliminating
throughout the United State-, the use of cigarettes by minors and
make this a special work for the ensuing year for the good of our
youth&quot; (Hamilton, 1927: 168). </p>

<p>It is for these reasons that the WCTU declared an educational
war against tobacco, but declined to seek prohibitory legislation
(Robert, 1949: 247). </p>

<p>The disenchanting experience of Prohibition, the omnipresence
of the tobacco industry, the need for new sources of state
revenues and the prevalence and popularity of cigarette smoking
combined to frustrate the anti-tobacco campaign. Cigarettes did
provide a new source of revenue. Federal income from tobacco
taxes soared to new heights because of increased cigarette
consumption and advanced rates. </p>

<p>In any event, by 1927, each of the 14 states which had enacted
prohibitory laws against cigarettes had repeated them (Neuberger,
1963: 52). Immediately thereafter these, states imposed taxes
upon the once forbidden product (Robert, 1949: 256; Federal Trade
Commission, 1970: 3).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>STATE REGULATION</b> </p>

<p>Only those laws which forbade the sale of tobacco products to
minors remain on the books, a trend set by New Jersey and
Washington in 1883 (Gottsegen, 1940: 155). </p>

<p>All but a few statutes restricting tobacco products to minors
were enacted between 1916-1920, simultaneous to the development
and popularity of the domestic-blend cigarette. </p>

<p>All 50 states bad laws banning sales to minors by 1950. Since
then, Georgia,. Louisiana, and Wisconsin have repealed theirs le
o 47 states plus the District of Columbia, WIL Vs prohibiting
sales to minors. </p>

<p>The most common age of restriction for cigarettes and tobacco
products today applies to persons under the age of 18. In an
effort to ensure stricter enforcement 11 states have lowered the
age of restriction from 21 to 15 (Tobacco Merchants Association,
1971: 1-2). In contrast to this trend, however, the, California
Legislature, 1971 defeated a bill to allow school smoking areas
and lowering the sale to minor restrictions to 15 years old (NIC
Smoking and Health, 1971: 1). </p>

<p>According to a Special Report released by the Tobacco
Merchants Association of the United States, the liability for
infractions in all states is on the vendor and donor of
cigarettes. In a few states, manufacturer and persons advising or
compelling the minors to smoke, or owning the premise where such
behavior occurs are also liable. However, in some states the
infraction does not extend to the parent or guardian. Some states
penalize the minor himself and others require that he divulge his
source. </p>

<p>Most of the statutes that prohibit the furnishing of
cigarettes to minors extend the ban also to one or more other
tobacco products. Only I 1 states restrict the sale
&quot;only&quot; to cigarettes. The efficacy of such statutes, in
the day of the cigarette machine, is subject to substantial
skepticism. </p>

<p><b>THE IMPETUS FOR FEDERAL SUMPTUARY REGULATION<br>
</b></p>

<p>The effect of smoking on health has been the subject of
discussion for hundreds of years. Early participants in the
tobacco controversy, beginning in the late 16th century, did not
associate the use of tobacco with the production of cancers
although they credited it with causing or curing nearly every
other known disease. </p>

<p>Dr. John Hill, of London, a physician, botanist and prolific
writer, first suggested the relation in 1761. In Cautions Against
the Immoderate Use ol Snuff, he reported six cases of
&quot;polypusses&quot; related to excessive indulgence in tobacco
in the form of snuff. One such &quot;polypus&quot; was described
as a swelling in one nostril that was hard, black and adherent on
a broad base. Painless at first, it later developed &quot;all the
frightful symptoms of an open cancer.&quot; Dr. Hill believed
that this lesion could be fatal and placed the blame for its
origin on tobacco. Dr. Hill has been noted as the first to report
an association of tobacco with cancer (Redmond, 1970: 21). </p>

<p>In 1939, the first scientific study linking lung cancer with
smoking was published. Between 1950 and 1954, 14 studies
associating cigarettes and serious diseases were completed
(Fritschler, 1969: 145). </p>

<p>At the present time, there is no government agency with clear
jurisdiction over the health aspects of cigarettes. The Federal
Trade Commission can act on matters of advertising and package
information. The Food and Drug Administration concerns itself
only with foods, drugs, solids, or liquids that are eaten or
drunk. Tobacco is neither a food nor a drug under current legal
definitions. Nor are cigarettes eaten or drunk; they are inhaled.<br>
</p>

<p>The 1890 edition of the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, an official
listing of drugs published by the government, included tobacco.
In later editions, tobacco was dropped. Former Senator Maurine
Neuberger has claimed that the removal of tobacco from the
Pharmacopoeia was the price paid to get support of tobacco-state
legislators for the Food and Drug Act of 1906. The leaf was
thereby removed from the jurisdiction of the FDA (Wagner, 1971:
74).<br>
</p>

<p>The first statement from the Public Health Service on the
subject was made by its Surgeon General, Leroy F. Burney, M.D.,
in the Journal of the American Medical Association in November,
1959. The heart of this statement was that &quot;the weight of
evidence at present implicates smoking as the principal
etiological factor in the increased incidence of lung
cancer&quot; (Diehl, 1969: 154). </p>

<p>In June, 1961 the American Cancer Society, the American Heart
Association and the National Tuberculosis and Respiratory Disease
Association jointly requested that a commission be appointed
&quot;to consider the responsibilities of government, of business
and of voluntary agencies relative to the health hazards of
cigarette smoking and to recommend a solution of this health
problem that would protect the public and would interfere least
with the freedom of industry and the happiness of
individuals&quot; (Diehl, 1969: 155). </p>

<p>On June 7, 1962, the then Surgeon General, Dr. Luther Terry,
announced, with the approval of the President, that he was
establishing an &quot;expert committee to undertake a
comprehensive review of all data on smoking and health.&quot; </p>

<p>The members of this committee were respected scientists who
had previously expressed no opinion about the relationship of
tobacco to health. All members were approved for appointment by
the tobacco industry as well as by the American Medical
Association and several national health agencies. Half of the
committee members were cigarette smokers. </p>

<p>On January 11, 1964, after some 15 months of intensive study,
this Advisory Committee- to the Surgeon General issued its
monumental unanimous report stating that &quot;cigarette smoking
is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States
to warrant, appropriate remedial action.&quot; </p>

<p>The committee stated unequivocally that &quot;cigarette
smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men; the magnitude
of the effect of cigarette smoking far outweighs other factors.
The data for women, though less extensive, point in the same
direction.&quot; Air pollution was found to be a very minor
factor in the cause of the disease, far outweighed by cigarette
smoking. </p>

<p>The death rate from heart disease, the report noted, was 70
percent higher in cigarette smokers than in nonsmokers, and
although there was not enough evidence to say positively that
smoking causes heart disease, there was enough to assume that it
is a cause and to take action against it. </p>

<p>Another conclusion of great importance was that
&quot;cigarette smoking is the most important of the causes of
chronic bronchitis in the United States and increases the risk of
dying from chronic bronchitis and emphysema.&quot; </p>

<p>The report analyzed the statistical, pathological, clinical,
and experimental evidence in relation to smoking and other
diseases. A total of more than 4,000 published reports were
studied and more than 150 investigators were personally
interviewed. &quot;The result was the most comprehensive and
authoritative report on this subject ever made&quot; (Diehl,
1969: 156).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE HEALTH WARNING REQUIREMENT<br>
</b></p>

<p>At the time the Surgeon General's Report was published, no
statute, administrative ruling or court decision required that
cigarette packaging or advertising contain any statement about
the dangers to health attributable to cigarette smoking.<br>
</p>

<p>After Trade Regulation Rule Proceedings in March and June
1964, the Federal Trade Commission concluded that cigarette
advertising was deceptive (misleading) and that advertisers had a
responsibility to warn the public of the health hazards of
cigarette smoking. </p>

<p>To accomplish this, the Commission proposed that cigarette
packages state the amount of tar and nicotine in the smoke of the
cigarette which the package contains and that cigarette packages
and cigarette advertising carry a statement such as:
&quot;Caution: Cigarette 'Smoking is Dangerous to Health. It May
Cause Death from Cancer and Other Diseases.&quot; </p>

<p>This warning was to be required on cigarette packages
beginning January 1, 1965, and in cigarette advertising beginning
July 1, 1965. The tobacco industry first obtained a postponement
of the effective dates of this ruling and then prevailed upon
Congress to vitiate the ruling by passing the Cigarette Labeling
and Advertising Act, requiring all packages of cigarettes sold in
this country to carry the label &quot;Cigarette Smoking May be
Hazardous to Your Health,&quot; but prohibiting the Federal Trade
Commission and state and local governments from requiring any
other label on cigarette packages and any warnings in cigarette
advertising at least until 1969. </p>

<p>A New York Times editorial called the Cigarette Labeling and
Advertising Act of 1965 &quot;a shocking piece of
special-interest legislation-a bill to protect the economic
health of the tobacco industry by freeing it of proper
regulation&quot; (Cigarette Labeling and Advertising, 1965). An
article in the Atlantic Monthly described the political
maneuvering behind this legislation under the title &quot;The
Quiet Victory of the Cigarette Lobby: How It Found the Best
Filter Yet-Congress&quot; (Diehl, 1969:162). </p>

<p>Public concern attending publication of the Surgeon General's
report, Smoking and Health, and the pending FTC regulations for
warnings on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertising
apparently convinced the tobacco industry that some action by
Congress was inevitable. </p>

<p>Reportedly the industry decided to accept a weak label on
cigarette packages provided that the legislation would prevent
any regulation of cigarette advertising. This was accomplished by
inserting into the proposed law the provision precluding the FTC
and all state or local governments from requiring any warning on
cigarette packages other than the one approved by Congress and
also preventing any warnings in cigarette advertising. </p>

<p>At House and Senate committee hearings, committee members
friendly to the industry attempted to discredit both the Surgeon
General's Report and the testimony given by the Surgeon General,
the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and the
representatives of various medical and health organizations. The
tobacco industry then presented a number of physicians who
testified that they disagreed with the conclusions of the Surgeon
General's Advisory Committee and that in their opinion there was
no real evidence that cigarette smoking is harmful (Diehl, 1969:
162). </p>

<p>Although this act temporarily prevented any requirement that
tar and nicotine content be indicated on cigarette packages, the
Federal Trade Commission did establish a laboratory to determine
the, tar and nicotine content of the smoke of cigarettes on the
American market, making the results of these tests available
periodically to the public. </p>

<p>The Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act also required that
about July 1, 1967, and annually thereafter the Federal Trade
Commission report to Congress concerning the effectiveness of the
warning label, and upon current practices of cigarette
advertising and promotion, with &quot;recommendations for
legislation that are deemed appropriate.&quot; </p>

<p>After an intensive study the Federal Trade Commission made a
detailed report to Congress with the following summary and
recommendations: &quot;There is virtually no evidence that the
warning statement on cigarette packages has had any significant
effect.&quot; </p>

<p>Sales remained constant and the industry continued to invest
hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising; $200 million a
year was being spent on radio and television alone in 1967;
cigarette advertisers had become the single largest product
advertisers on television accounting for about eight per cent of
television advertising time (Wagner, 1971: 166).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE<br>
</b></p>

<p>Another government agency had become concerned with cigarette
advertising. The Federal Communications Commission is mandated to
assure that the airways, which belong to the public, are used in
the public interest. </p>

<p>John P. Banzhaf, III, who has been called the &quot;Ralph
Nader of the tobacco industry&quot; was responsible for the FCC's
involvement in the cigarette advertising controversy. After
viewing several cigarette commercials on television, Banzhaf
concluded that &quot;what he was seeing might be considered
legally 'controversial&quot;' (Wagner, 1971: 168). He then wrote
to WCBS-TV in New York on December 1, 1966, requesting that he or
some other responsible spokesman be given an opportunity to
present contrasting views on the issue of the benefits and
advisability of smoking. </p>

<p>Banzhaf's letter cited three commercials that presented the
view that smoking is &quot;socially acceptable and desirable,
manly, and a necessary part of a rich full life. &quot;He
asked-free time roughly approximate to that spent on the
promotion of the &quot;virtues and values of smoking.&quot; CBS
routinely turned down the request. He sent a second letter to CBS
and submitted a formal complaint against WCBS-TV to the FCC in
Washington. </p>

<p>The FCC, in a letter to the television station dated June 2,
1967, said programs it had broadcast dealing with the effect of
smoking on health were insufficient to offset the effects of paid
advertisements broadcast for a total of five to 10 minutes each
broadcast day. &quot;We hold that the fairness doctrine is
applicable to such advertisements&quot; the Commission said. They
rejected Banzhaf's claim for equal time, however. </p>

<p>The FCC called on the station to provide free each week
&quot;a significant amount of time for the other viewpoint,&quot;
thereby implementing the smoking education campaigns launched by
the government under the cigarette labeling law. &quot;This
requirement will not preclude or curtail presentation by stations
of cigarette advertising which they choose to carry.&quot; The
FCC basically decided that it was not in the public interest for
the airways to be used by radio and television to advertise
cigarettes without some warning of the health hazards involved
with smoking (Wagner, 1971: 169). </p>

<p>The FCC was deluged with requests to reconsider its action.
The agency stood firm in its unanimous decision. As a result of
the ruling many of the voluntary health agencies and the Public
Health Service made available to the television and radio
industries spot announcements and other program materials on the
serious consequences to health caused by cigarette smoking. </p>

<p>The FCCs decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals on
November 21, 1968; the court said the agency could indeed use its
fairness doctrine to require free time for anti-smoking
commercials. &quot;The danger cigarettes may pose to health is,
among others, a danger to life itself,&quot; the Court said. </p>

<p>As the Commission emphasized, it is a danger inherent in the
normal use of the product, not one merely associated with its
abuse or dependent on intervening fortuitous events. It threatens
a substantial body of the population, not merely a peculiarly
susceptible fringe group. Moreover, the danger, though not
established beyond all doubt, is documented by a compelling
cumulation of statistical evidence (Wagner, 1971: l66-173). </p>

<p>(The cigarette manufacturers then asked the Supreme Court to
review their case, but the high court turned down the request,
leaving the appeals court decision standing.) </p>

<p><i>&quot;Most observers agree that the dramatic entrance of
the FCC into the smoking controversy was probably the most
important single event during the three-year moratorium on
requiring health warnings in cigarette advertisements imposed by
Congress on the FTC&quot;</i> (Wagner, 1971 : 175).<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>THE BAN ON ADVERTISING<br>
</b></p>

<p>Both the U.S. Public Health Service and Federal Trade
Commission have annually reported findings to Congress since
passage of the cigarette labeling law. The FTC recommended that
the Act should be amended to: &quot;Warning: Cigarette Smoking Is
Dangerous to Health and May Cause Death From Cancer and Other
Diseases.&quot; </p>

<p>Additionally, the FTC recommended legislation to require the
same warning to appear in all cigarette advertisements and to
require statements of tar and nicotine content on all cigarette
packages and in all advertising. </p>

<p>Legislation to accomplish these objectives as well as the
following were recommended by the FTC: </p>

<p><i>Cigarette advertising on television and radio should be
barred entirely. Alternately, cigarette advertising on television
and radio should be limited as to hours in which it may appear;
the extent to which it may appear; and the types of programs on
which it may appear;</i> </p>

<p><i>Increased appropriations, should be made to the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare for education of the public
(especially young people) as to the health hazards of smoking;</i>
</p>

<p><i>Appropriations should be made for research under the
direction of the National Institutes of Health on the development
of less hazardous cigarettes.<br>
</i></p>

<p>&quot;By 1969, the stage had been set for a showdown over
cigarette advertising and promotion&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 190).
The U.S. Government was increasing its efforts to discourage the
sale of cigarettes. Post office trucks carried posters:
&quot;100,000 Doctors Have Quit Smoking.&quot; </p>

<p>The Surgeon General continued to release reports about the
adverse health effects of smoking. </p>

<p>Dr. Daniel Horn, director of the National Clearinghouse for
Smoking and Health, was urging doctors to deliver antismoking
appeals to patients in their offices. </p>

<p>Movie personalities had become involved in the American Cancer
Society's campaign called I.Q. (for &quot;I Quit&quot;) that
passed out lapel buttons and dispatched public speakers around
the country to discourage the habit. Doris Day, Debbie Reynolds
and Lawrence Welk refused to allow tobacco companies to sponsor
their TV shows. </p>

<p>Two ad agencies--Ogilivy and Mather and Doyle Dane
Bernbach-and a few radio and television stations would not accept
cigarette business. Several magazines did not accept cigarette
advertising as a matter of principle: Reader's Digest, the New
Yorker, and the Saturday Review. The Christian Science Monitor
had never carried cigarette ads; the Boston Globe announced in
May, 1969 that it would no longer accept such advertising
&quot;because accumulated medical evidence has indicated that
cigarette smoking is hazardous to health&quot; (Wagner, 1971:
220). </p>

<p>In April 1969, a few weeks before the House Interstate and
Foreign Commerce Committee was scheduled to open hearings on the
FTC proposals, a series of bills were introduced in the House by
representatives of tobacco producing states. One such bill, H.R.
7177, co-sponsored by all eleven of North Carolina's House
Delegation, proposed &quot;to establish a comprehensive Federal
program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with
respect to any relationship between smoking and health.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>Identical measures were introduced under the sponsorship of
congressmen from Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and Florida. Some
accounts of the activity on Capitol Hill during this period
attribute these bills to the tobacco interests' intention
&quot;to prevent strengthening of the warning label and make
permanent the ban on state and Federal regulation of cigarette
advertising, which was due to expire on June 30. Passage of this
legislation was the best tobacco interests could have hoped for
under the circumstances&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 205). </p>

<p>After testimony from both sides, the House Committee approved
a stiffer health warning but prohibited regulatory action on
cigarette advertising for six years and in other ways generally
upheld the status quo. </p>

<p>The Senate, Commerce Committee, on December 5, 1970, voted out
a bill banning cigarette commercials from the air as of January
1, 1971. The FTC was prohibited from acting on cigarette ads in
newspapers and magazines until the middle of 1972. The labeling
provision in the Senate bill was weaker than that established in
the House-voted measure, and the bill also precluded cigarette
regulatory action by the fifty states and local governments. </p>

<p>In a session on December 12, a floor amendment was introduced
which loosened the Committee's proposed restriction on the FTC by
allowing the agency to require health warnings in advertising as
of July 1, 1971. The bill also authorized the FTC to move sooner
if it found that tobacco companies were switching from broadcast
to print advertising so massively that it could be considered a
&quot; gross abuse.&quot; This bill also approved a new required
health warning for cigarette packages&quot;Warning: Cigarette
Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.&quot; </p>

<p>After Senate passage, the measure still had to -pass a joint
Senate-House Conference Committee where important differences
between the two bills had to be reconciled. </p>

<p>The bill that emerged from conference differed only slightly
from the Senate measure. The cautionary label to which the
conferees agreed provides: &quot;Warning: The Surgeon General Has
Determined That Cigarette Smoking is Dangerous to Your
Health.&quot; &quot;In a final concession to the broadcasters,
the conferees agreed to delay for one day the blackout of
cigarette commercials from December 31, 1970, to midnight January
1, 1971. That would give them a last shower of cash from the New
Year's Day football bowl games&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 216). It was
estimated that the loss to television and radio stations would
amount to about $220 million a year, or about 7.5% of their total
advertising revenues. </p>

<p>President Nixon signed the Act on April 1, 1970. </p>

<p>Some observers marvel that the bill was passed &quot;in spite
of massive pressure that had been brought to bear against it and
against the regulation of cigarette advertising generally, by the
tobacco industry, the broadcasting industry, and the lobbyists
and their political allies. This was a combination that for years
had proved invincible against a counterforce of scientists and
public health and public interest advocates who, armed with
formidable statistics on the damage to health and life caused by
cigarette smoking, had sought to protect consumers by requiring
all cigarette advertising to provide adequate warnings of these
dangers&quot; (Whiteside, 1970: 58). </p>

<p>There are those observers , on the other hand, who do not view
the ban of cigarette advertising on television and radio as such
a success for the consumer. Rather, they cite the statistics on
consumption in other countries to point up the fact that bans on
advertising do not reduce sales.<br>
</p>

<p>In Czechoslovakia, for example, no direct advertising of
tobacco is permitted; yet consumption increased 14% between 1953
and 1958. Advertising of foreign cigarettes was banned in 1962 in
Italy; the following year sales increased 39.4% and in 1964, 11.7
%. Sales increased in England after television cigarette
advertisements were banned in 1965. Consumption figures for the
following three years in Britain reveal increases: 112 billion
cigarettes in 1965, 118 billion in 1966; and 119.1 billion in
1967 (Cigarette Advertising, 1970: 113-114). </p>

<p>Robert Miller, an agricultural economist in the Department of
Agriculture's Economic Research Service, reports that cigarette
consumption is up in every part of the world although advertising
was banned in several European countries some years ago. He
predicts an eventual decrease in sales during the next five years
and perhaps a 12-13% decrease in tobacco consumption (Tobacco
Advertising Could End, 1970: 7). </p>

<p>Other observers can see a gradual reduction in cigarette
consumption as a result of a prohibition on advertising; some
feel a ban on advertising merely makes it difficult to launch a
new brand. Others predict that the ban will eliminate the social
acceptability of the habit although consumption will not go down.
</p>

<p>The &quot;live dangerously novelty&quot; has also been
identified as a possible cause for gains in consumption;
&quot;such a philosophy might well be prevalent among the young,
the very ones that antismoking advocates are most anxious to
protect&quot; (Cigarette Advertising, 1970: 112-113). </p>

<p>Another consequence of the ban on cigarette commercials was
the FCC ruling that the broadcasters' obligation to air
antismoking messages had ended. The stations continue to run them
as public service spots; however, the volume was decreased
considerably from the former 1 to 3 ratio established by the FCC.
The antismoking forces are fearful that a decrease in these spots
is harmful to their cause and may retard their efforts to reduce
cigarette consumption. </p>

<p>On October 20,1971, a U.S. District Court ruled that the
Congressional ban on cigarette advertising is constitutional. The
ruling stated that such advertising does not qualify under the
First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech; a sharp
distinction was drawn between guarantees of freedom. of speech
for individuals and the &quot;limited extent&quot; to which
broadcast advertising qualifies for such protection. </p>

<p>The court also ruled that Congress had more than one
&quot;rational basis&quot; for excluding cigarette ads from
television and not the printed media one being that broadcasts
are the &quot;most persuasive&quot; types of advertising
(Cigarette Ad Ban, 1971). Ultimately, the constitutional question
will have to be decided by the United States Supreme Court.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CONSUMPTION TRENDS<br>
</b></p>

<p>Cigarette smoking is widespread in America today; 45.9% of the
male population 17 years of age and over and 30.5% of females 17
and over are smokers. In 1970, about $10.6 billion of
individuals' expenditures was for cigarettes. </p>

<p>Data on cigarette sales and advertising has been obtained by
the FTC from domestic cigarette manufacturers; the table below
provides cigarette sales for the years 1963 to the present
(Federal Trade Commission, 1970: 3) :<br>
</p>

<p><b>TOTAL CIGARETTES SOLD<br>
</b></p>

<p>Year Billions </p>

<p>1963 516.5 </p>

<p>1964 505.0 </p>

<p>1965 521.1 </p>

<p>1966 529.9 </p>

<p>1967 535.8 </p>

<p>1968 540.3 </p>

<p>1969 527.9 </p>

<p>1970 534.2 </p>

<p>The reduction in sales in 1964 coincides with the public
attention given the Report of the Surgeon General issued on
January 11, 1964. Public awareness of the dangers cited in the
Report was high. It was soon forgotten, for in 1965 the total
number of cigarettes sold was almost 5 billion higher than the
year prior to the Surgeon General's Report. </p>

<p>In 1969 there was another significant decline; it has been
suggested that this decline is attributable to several
high-visibility events and also by sales tax increases. For
example, the FCC ruling was upheld in November 1968 giving
impetus to the antismoking TV campaign; the federal government's
anti-smoking campaign was in full swing during 1968-69; the
public outcry was being felt by economic interests-magazines,
newspapers, personalities and advertising agencies which refused
sponsorship for business from tobacco companies. </p>

<p>There were significant state tax increases immediately prior
to 1969 which probably contributed to the reduction in sales
during that year. During fiscal year 1967, 15 states increased
their cigarette tax rates; the average increase was 3.5 cents.
The rate increase ranged from New York's, Ohio's, and Illinois'
two cents to California's and Florida's seven cents. The next
year, seven more states increased their cigarette taxes. The
rates ranged from Massachusetts' and Vermont's two cents to
Minnesota's, Rhode Island's, and Tennessee's five cents the
average increase approximately four cents (Council of State
Governments, 1968: 196-197). </p>

<p>The ban on cigarette advertising on television and radio began
on January 2, 1971, yet several calculations reflect a rise in
cigarette sales during the past year. Business Week projections
of industry sales and brand rankings show that a record 529
billion cigarettes were consumed in 1971, 1.5% more than 1970's
sales (Where Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 56). Tobacco industry
sources estimate that consumption has risen in 1971 by 1.5% to
535 billion cigarettes (Cigarette Sales Up, 1972: 3). </p>

<p>John C. Maxwell, tobacco analyst for Oppenheimer &amp;
Company, a brokerage firm, also reported a rise-2.3% in domestic
unit sales in 1971. He relates part of the growth in cigarette
consumption to the population mix the increase hit the 20-40 year
age group, where smoking is heaviest. The Maxwell report suggests
that the rest of this growth must be related to &quot;government
overkill, wherein many voices in Washington suggest that
everything we eat or drink is harmful&quot; (Maxwell, 1971: 1).<br>
</p>

<p>An industry specialist with Manufacturers Hlanover Trust
Company, on the other hand, attributes both the lag in sales in
1969 and the new increase to the &quot;very effective antismoking
ads on television. Since the ban, these commercials rarely
appear&quot; (Cigarette Sales Up, 1972: 3). </p>

<p>Another industry executive notes, &quot;For years we have
believed that the role of cigarette advertising is to attract
smokers from competitive brands rather than induce nonsmokers to
start smoking. We failed to convince the Federal Communications
Commission of this, but it is borne out by our industry's
experience since the TV ban. Within a relatively stable market,
some companies have continued to gain while others lost. Some
brands have increased their share of market while others have
declined&quot; (Where Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 56). Skeptics
continue to argue that tobacco companies have also been trying to
recruit new young smokers.<br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>TOBACCO: ECONOMICS AND POLITICS<br>
</b></p>

<p>It is generally accepted that tobacco has been an extremely
powerful force in American politics. Approximately 50 million
smokers smoked 535 billion cigarettes in the past year. More than
100,000 employees receive $500 million in wages annually from
tobacco manufacturing companies; over 4,500 wholesalers handle
the distribution of tobacco products and hundreds of thousands of
merchants depend on tire sale of cigarettes as a source of their
income. </p>

<p>Cigarette companies had been spending over $200 million per
year on radio and television advertising, and since the ban,
almost all of this money has been diverted to other media
advertising providing many thousands of jobs in ad agencies and
in the various media. Three million people from about 750,000
families receive $1.4 billion annually for the cultivation of
tobacco used in cigarettes. </p>

<p>Peripherally affected are those involved in producing the 40
million pounds of moisture-proof cellophane, the 70 million
pounds of aluminum foil, the 27 billion printed packs, and the
2.7 billion cartons (Cigarette Advertising, 1970: 110-111;
Wagner, 1971: 120; USDA, Tobacco Situation, 1971a: 29-31). </p>

<p>One writer, reporting on the present public policy trend,
notes that &quot;attempts to discourage smoking would affect the
lives of millions of people and would have profound economic and
political consequences&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 121). </p>

<p>Advocates of cigarette smoking today are organized into
extremely powerful groups, each having its own specific function
and plentiful resources. </p>

<p>The Tobacco Tax Council, established in 1949, compiles data on
the taxation of tobacco products by the Federal, state and local
governments. The Council's annual booklet, &quot;Cigaret Taxes in
the United States&quot; has been superseded by &quot; The Tax
Burden on Tobacco&quot; since 1966. This pamphlet
&quot;undertakes to trace the history of tobacco taxes from the
years of the Civil War down through [the present year]&quot;
(Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: iii).<br>
</p>

<p>The trade association promoting the welfare of the tobacco
industry is the Tobacco Merchants Association of the U.S. It is
composed of manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, importers,
exporters, leaf dealers, suppliers, and firms interested in the
industry. Its Bulletins cover legislation, trends, special
reports; its numerous other publications and activities seek to
improve industry operations and expand outlets (e.g.,
international) f or potential sales (Tobacco Merchants
Association, 1971: 1-4).<br>
</p>

<p>The tobacco industry's point of view is nurtured and protected
by the Tobacco Institute, a nonprofit corporation founded in
1958. Its membership includes major U.S. manufacturers of
cigarettes, smoking and chewing tobacco, and snuff: The Bloch
Brothers Tobacco Company, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco
Corporation, Conwood Corporation, G. A. Georgopulo &amp; Company,
Helme Products, Larus &amp; Brother Company, Liggett &amp; Myers,
Lorillard, Philip Morris Incorporated, R. J. Reynolds Industries,
Scotten-Dillion Company, and United States Tobacco Company. </p>

<p>The Institute is financed by contributions from the large
corporations according to their share of the market. The
institute reports on the pro-tobacco side of the medical story,
attempting to discredit antismoking publicity, and publishes
information on the historical role of tobacco, its place in the
national economy, the industry itself, and the public's use of
tobacco products. </p>

<p>The Council for Tobacco Research, created in 1953 in response
to medical bulletins reporting on the hazards of smoking,
processes and administers millions of research grants.
&quot;Although research money was to be awarded with no strings
attached [The Council] nicely serve[s] the purpose of identifying
the industry with the welfare of humanity and spreading good will
through the scientific community&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 80). </p>

<p>The scientific data continue to be attacked from both sides.
Since 1954 a great quantity of research has been published and,
in turn, disputed. For example, &quot;the press played up the
Hammond and Auerbach study and the claim that twelve beagles had
developed lung cancer&quot; from cigarettes. &quot;The findings
have subsequently been downgraded by ' v the author to two
microscopic tumors with the further revelation that two dogs in
the control group also developed tumors&quot; (Maxwell, 1971: 1).
</p>

<p>Another area of contention has developed around the
relationship between cigarette smoke itself and lung cancer. A
recent paper by Dr. Geoffrey Myddelton given at the Second World
Conference on Smoking and Health in London, September 20-24,
1971, compares the incidence of smoking and lung cancer in
various countries. He indicates, &quot;Japan smokes 86% as much
as Britain but has only 27% of its lung cancer. Canada smokes
twice as many cigarettes as the Netherlands but has only 69% as
much lung cancer.&quot; He goes on to correlate the use of diesel
file] in England to lung cancer (Maxwell, 1971: 2). </p>

<p>From the other side, the United States Public Health Service
1972 report The Health Consequences of Smoking maintains that
&quot;nonsmokers as well as smokers may be harmed by cigarettes,
. . . tobacco smoke in closed cars and poorly ventilated rooms
can contaminate the atmosphere for everyone. . . . The chief
danger is exposure to low levels of the deadly gas, carbon
monoxide. Experiments, with animals have shown that various
concentrations of the colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas
'adversely affect' the structure and function of the heart and
lungs. The implication is that this may also be true in man&quot;
(Study Says Cigarette Smoke Also May Harm Nonusers, 1972: 1). </p>

<p>It is estimated that at the present time one and a half to two
million adults give up smoking every year. Sensing the hazards of
the future, some cigarette, companies sought fiscal security in
diversification and substitution; tobacco manufacturers are now
marketing, for example, safety razors, fertilizers, dog food,
ballpoint pens, peanut butter and other non-nicotine products. By
1967, sales on non-tobacco products accounted for approximately
one-third of the, total sales of cigarette manufacturers. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether tobacco power will be whittled
away any further in the next few years. Some feel that &quot;the
tobacco subsystem has succeeded in keeping the health question a
low priority item on the government's agenda by playing one
government agency off against another.... This subsystem cuts
across institutional lines and includes the paid representatives
of tobacco growers, marketing organizations and manufacturers.,.
Congressmen representing tobacco growing states [are] leading
members of four subcommittees, including two ,appropriations
subcommittees and two committees in each house of Congress
handling tobacco legislation. . . . Tobacco power [is] thus
firmly entrenched and well supported&quot; (Wagner, 1971: 121). </p>

<p>On the other hand, a strongly worded commentary by an industry
spokesman cites Justice John Marshall's statement to illustrate
industry's precarious position: &quot;The power to tax involves
the power to destroy.&quot; He continues with a description of
the tobacco industry's present situation:<br>
</p>

<p><i>The onslaught of state and local taxes on tobacco products
... represents a most serious threat to all segments of our
industry.... We are now facing a calculated attempt to destroy,
or at least drastically curtail, the sale of smoking products.
The political and economic climate is most favorable for this
attack. Smoking and health is a prime political issue in the same
context as air pollution, crime in the streets, and consumerism.
At the same time, local governments are verging on bankruptcy.
Revenue of any sort is therefore a must. It is a tough battle,
and cigarette industry is currently bearing the largest part of
the attack </i>(Regensburg, 1971: 146).<br>
</p>

<p>The revenues gained from tobacco tax collections are
significant. Over $2.1 billion in Federal taxes and over $2.5
billion in state cigarette taxes were collected in Fiscal Year
1971 (Tobacco Tax Council, 1970: 4-6, 8; USDA, Tobacco Situation,
1971b: 44). Total tobacco taxes were $4.8 billion in 1971
compared with $1.7 billion in 1950. </p>

<p>In 1970 tobacco taxes accounted for 1.1% of total federal tax
receipts and represented 13.8 percent of all excise taxes (USDA,
Tobacco Situation, 1971b: 40). This places the tobacco tax as the
seventh largest source of collection by the Federal government
behind the major giants, e.g., income and profit taxes (both
corporate and individual), employment taxes, manufacturers excise
taxes, alcohol taxes, and estate and gift taxes. In terms of
individual commodities it ranks behind only alcohol. Thus,
federal revenue would be importantly affected if tobacco
consumption were to decline. <br>
</p>

<hr>

<p><b>CONCLUSION<br>
</b></p>

<p>The big question is how the Federal government plans to
proceed. Six tobacco bills are now pending in Congress. One of
these bills would give the Federal Trade Commission authority to
set maximum permissible limits on tar and nicotine. Another would
establish a graduated cigarette tax based on tar content. </p>

<p>The FTC is presently carrying on negotiations with the
industry to come up with a &quot;clear and conspicuous&quot;
health warning for its print advertising. It is expected that the
industry, &quot; which has been working closely with the FTC
'will' take some 'voluntary' labeling action&quot; (Where
Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 57). </p>

<p>The industry feels the pressure; one member explains: &quot;We
are resigned to it. Over-all.... the industry mood is much more
relaxed-now that we have this first big year behind us&quot;
(Where Cigarette Makers Spend, 1971: 57). </p>

<p>The public is clamoring for government action; a 1970 College
Poll'. surveying-youths 18 and older on more than 100 campuses
reveals that 96% believe that smoking is dangerous to one's
health (College Poll, 1971). </p>

<p>Further, a 1969 study on teenage (13- to 18-yearolds) smoking
attitudes, motivation and habits indicates &quot;deep teenage
dissatisfaction with cigarette smoking, considerable knowledge of
its ill effects, but a very exaggerated estimate of the
acceptance of smoking by the adult world&quot; (Lieberman
Research, 1969: 1-20). And, a 1970 nationwide survey of teenagers
revealed: &quot;72% of non-smokers identified physicians as the
one group that could persuade them not to start smoking and 42%
of those who smoked said their physician's advice would influence
them to stop&quot; (Doctors, 1970: 24). </p>

<p>Critics of the industry claim: &quot;The controversy about
smoking and health continues largely because of the energy, time
and money spent by the tobacco industry in keeping this
controversy alive&quot; (College Poll, 1971).<br>
</p>

<p>In September, 1935, Fortune Magazine published a discussion of
the medical implications of smoking. It concluded that: </p>

<p><i>This much can be said: That the possible benefit to be
derived from tobacco is always less than the possible harm </i>(Robert,
1949: 256).<br>
</p>

<p>Official policy has never accepted this judgment. In recent
years, steps have been taken to discourage smoking, although
there is little conclusive evidence that consumption patterns are
changing. It can be expected that official policy and alterations
in individual behavior will both evolve slowly during the coming
years. The socioeconomic impact of a sudden change in official
policy would be great, a circumstance reflecting the momentum of
several centuries of intense commercial activity.<br>
