<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
September 26, 1996</I>

<P>
According to Lindsey, the number of credit card delinquencies
has increased sharply during the past two years but the volume
of loans which is delinquent has increased by much less.  The
household sector has also been experiencing a sharp rise in its
asset values, not just its leverage.  Since 1991, the household
sector has enjoyed a $4.75 trillion capital gain on its equity
portfolio and $9.5 trillion gain on its total assets while liabilities
have increased by only $1.5 trillion.  The major risk in the debt
expansion is its concentration among lower income Americans. 
As Lindsey explained,

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;We estimate, that on average, the household sector increased
its debt-to-income ratio about 5 percentage points between 1992
and 1995.  This was the result of a 2 percentage point increase
in mortgage debt, from 59.8 percent of income to 61.9 percent
of income and a 3 percentage point increase in non-mortgage consumer
debt, from 16.9 percent of income o 19.8 percent of income.&quot;</I>

<P>

<I>&quot;Nevertheless, the survey does suggest some interesting
trends in the distribution of this debt.  Typically, households
earning more than $100,000 per year sharply reduced their debt
levels between 1992 and 1995.  The share of total household debt
held by these households fell from one-third to one-quarter and
this decline was particularly concentrated among households earning
more than $250,000 per year.  These upper income groups experienced
a decline in both the mean and median absolute level of debt outstanding,
while all other income groups increased their debt.&quot;</I>
<P>

<I>&quot;The decline in the debt levels for these groups makes
the rise in debt levels for other groups more striking.  For example,
households with incomes between $50,000 and $100,000 increased
their rates of aggregate mortgage debt to aggregate income by
about one-sixth and their corresponding consumer debt to income
ratio by roughly 50 percent.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Of course, some households increased their debt substantially
more than this, some not at all.  <I>The Survey of Consumer Finance
does indicate a striking increase in the willingness to go into
debt in the $50,00 to $100,000 income group.</I>  The proportion
of survey households in this income group reporting credit card
debt rose 13 percentage points, from 51% in 1992 to 64% in 1995,
compared to a 4 point increase, from 44 percent to 48 percent
for the whole population.  Those holding installment debt such
as auto loans increased from 52 percent to 59 percent in this
income group while the proportion in the overall population with
this type of debt was unchanged.  Nearly 60 percent of the total
increase in non-mortgage debt outstanding was assumed by households
in this income group.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;Debt increases for households earning under $50,000 were
also sizable.  The increasing attractiveness of various types
of financing tied to one's home produced a particularly large
increase in the ratio of mortgage debt to income.  It should be
noted that although the mortgage debt to income ratio increase
just 7 percentage points for households earning under $25,000,
compared to 10 to 11 percentage points for households earnings
$25,000 to $100,000, home ownership rates are much lower among
this segment of the population.  Adjusted for the lower level
of home ownership rates among this income group, mortgage debt
to income ratios increased more for these lower income groups
than for the $50,000 to $100,000 income group.  I might add that
the rapid expansion of mortgage financing among low and moderate
income groups is borne out by other data as well.  We will not
know for some time what he overall effect of this lending will
be on default and delinquency rates.&quot;</I>
<P>
<I>&quot;But these data also show that while some of the added
credit extension during this period is to people in income groups
that traditionally haven't owed much debt, the bulk is not.  While
overall debt levels increased for all groups earning under $100,000,
<I>the only group to increase its relative share of such non-mortgage
debt was the $50,000 to $100,000 income group</I>.  Thus, it is
reasonable to conclude that the main reason for the household
debt expansion of recent years is not so much an extension of
debt to new households, but an increase in the debt levels taken
on by fairly well-to-do segments of the population to whom being
in debt (albeit not at these levels) is not an unusual experience.&quot;</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Governor Lindsey's testimony on the debt issue is important because
in previous speeches he has warned about the risk of leverage
excesses in the household sector.  His September testimony suggests
that consumer debt will pose risks for middle income families
during future recessions but that there will not be an abrupt
decline of borrowing or suspension of credit access by banks large
enough to trigger a business downturn during the twelve months.
<P>
The disagreements which exist in both the private sector and the
Fed about the economy's optimal growth rate will not be resolvable
for some time.  If the economy can continue to enjoy output growth
of 2.5-3.5% with no upward pressure on inflation, there will be
increasing support for the view that government data underestimates
productivity growth as well as the economy's effective capital
stock.  But as adopting such a position today would require the
Fed to take risks on the side of inflation without totally conclusive
proof that the economy's optimal growth rate is higher than 2.0-2.5%,
it is doubtful that they will remain passive if output growth
rebounds to the 3.0-3.5% range during the fourth quarter.  They
would probably tighten by at least 50 basis points during November
and December.
<P>
<I>The American forecasting community has a generally pessimistic
view of the outlook for both output growth and the resilience
of corporate profit margins next year.</I>  In the most recent
Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus, forecasters projected
output growth of 2.2% and CPI inflation of 3.0% during 1997 compared
to 2.4% for growth and 3.0% for inflation this year.  The great
contrast in the 1996 and 1997 forecasts centers on corporate profits.
 American forecasters are projecting only 3.1% profit growth next
year compared to 9.0% during 1996.  <I>The pessimism about profits
suggests that analysts expect rising wages to come at the expense
of corporate profit margins rather than higher inflation.</I>
<P>
If the U.S. forecasting consensus is correct, the Fed should be
able to fine tune another year of modest growth during 1997 with
only modest interest rate hikes or even with a stable monetary
policy.  <I>The problem with such forecasts is that it is difficult
to believe that business or household psychology will remain static
in the face of a sixth and seventh year of uninterrupted economic
expansion.</I>  If everyone concludes that the risk of a recession
is minimal, it is difficult to believe that investment plans,
hiring intentions or wage expectations will remain consistent
with output growth of only 2.2% and real interest rates of 2.0-2.5%
against the backdrop of an unemployment rate in the 4.5-5.0% range.
 As a result, the odds are high that there will be more cyclical
volatility in the economy during the year ahead than is currently
being reflected in the forecasting community.  Either the economy
will lose momentum on a sustained basis this autumn or output
growth will rebound and set the stage for a monetary policy adjustment
which will reduce output growth to only 1.0-1.5% for two quarters
during the second half of 1997or early 1998.
