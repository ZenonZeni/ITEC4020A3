<h2>Solar Water Heating</h2>

<p><strong>Overview</strong><BR>
Solar water heating is a well-proven and readily available technology that directly substitutes renewable energy for conventional water heating.  This Federal Technology Alert
(FTA) of the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), one of
a series on new energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy
technologies, describes the various types of solar water-heating
systems, the situations in which solar water heating is likely
to be cost-effective, considerations in selecting and designing
a system, and basic steps for installing a system.
<P>
There are a variety of different types of solar water-heating systems, but
the basic technology is straightforward.  A collector absorbs
heat from the sun and the system transfers that heat to water.
 That water is stored for use as needed, with a conventional system
providing any necessary additional heating.  A typical system
will reduce the need for conventional water heating by about two-thirds,
eliminating the cost of electricity or fossil fuel and the environmental
impacts associated with their use.
