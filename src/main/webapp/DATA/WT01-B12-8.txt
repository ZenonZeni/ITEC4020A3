        keynote speakers at a recent anti-aging conference in Las
        Vegas addressed the significance of the
        physician-pharmacist-patient relationship, and the
        importance of not violating this &quot;triad.&quot; <br>
        <img src="images/triam.gif" align="bottom" vspace="2"
        width="300" height="173"><br>
        The FDA and National Association of State Boards of
        Pharmacy agree, and allow more latitude to all parties
        when this triad is intact. This triad has always been the
        basis of the profession of pharmacy. Each year- as the
        rate of development of new medications and therapeutic
        and diagnostic technologies accelerates, the
        physician-pharmacist-patient relationship becomes more
        significant to each of its members. Health care providers
        are seeing more patients each day. Patients are being
        forced to become more involved in their own healthcare.
        Physicians and pharmacists working together with the
        patient can provide the necessary supervision. When
        everyone places the care and well-being of the patient
        foremost, this triad is extremely effective. Utilizing
        available resources and the professional expertise of
        other members of the health care team strengthens the
        ability of the triad to provide optimal patient care. Our
        pharmacists have been specially trained to deal with
        patient care issues. We welcome the opportunity to work
        with you.</font><font size="5"><strong> </strong></font>Patty

        intracavernous injection of alprostadil (prostaglandin

        From The Journal of Urology Vol. 150, 1822-4: &quot;A

        MIGRAINE - </strong></font><font size="3">In an open
        multicentre study in Switzerland, dihydroergotamine nasal
        spray was studied for its efficacy and tolerability in
        the treatment of acute migraine attacks (common and
        classical migraine-one attack per patient) in a total of
        904 patients. In the global assessment, 76.8% of all the
        patients reported good efficacy (freedom from pain, less
        pain or shorter duration of pain). When the nasal spray
        was used in the prodomal phase, good efficacy could be
        obtained by 90 (63%) of 143 patients. 18.1% of all the
        patients treated- more frequently those who obtained no
        beneficial effect and /or who took additional medication
        during the migraine attack- reported one or more minor
        side effects such as local nasal irritation, nausea,
        dizziness and vomiting. Contact your

        Right Medication in the Right Doses</strong></font><br>
        <strong>by Gene Lawrence, M.D., Obstetrics and
        Gynecology, Newport Beach, CA</strong><br>
        All physicians, gynecologists in particular, encounter
        patients frustrated by recurrent bacterial vaginosis. A
        recent case had an Enterococcus which was resistant to
        clindamycin, sulfonamides, and metronidazole. The simple
        solution was seven days of ampicillin vaginal
        suppositories compounded by my local &quot;problem
        solving specialist&quot;. Although the underlying
        pathophysiology varies from patient to patient, an
        alkaline vagina is commonly the problem. An acidic vagina
        can usually be achieved by daily utilization of 600 mg
        boric acid suppositories for thirty days. If lactobacilli
        are not found on a follow-up culture, the boric acid
        suppositories should be continued.
        <p><font size="4"><em>Editor&#146;s Footnote<br>
        </em></font>The suppository is a practical alternative
        for infants or severely debilitated patients who cannot
        take oral medication and for whom the parental route is
        unsuitable. Suppositories have been used for several
        thousand years and are referred to in the ancient
        writings of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Early
        suppositories consisted of cloth, plants, wood or other
        material used plain or soaked in a solution of
        &quot;medication&quot; prior to administration. Today, a
        suppository is generally made from a fatty acid base
        consisting of palm and coconut oils or a water soluble
        base consisting of polyethylene glycol. Desirable
        characteristics of a good suppository include: it is
        stable, non-irritating, compatible with a variety of
        drugs, aesthetically acceptable, and melts or dissolves
        in various body fluids. Generally, a correctly compounded
        vaginal or rectal suppository can quickly and easily
        deliver up to 600 mg of active drug. Suppositories can be
        used to treat local conditions such as hemorrhoids or
        infection, or systemic problems such as nausea, pain or
        inflammation. In conclusion, the suppository is very
        useful in treating a variety of medical conditions and
        the physician will benefit from adding this alternative
        dosage form to his armamentarium. </p>
