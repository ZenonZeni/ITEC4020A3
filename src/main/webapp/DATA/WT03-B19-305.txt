<P>
The CRC for Diagnostic Technologies brings together Australia's leading research groups for protein and DNA diagnostic technology and the key Australian diagnostic manufacturers. In Victoria, this collaboration extends through CSIRO, La Trobe University and Silenus Pty Ltd.
The centre was established in 1995 with the aim of developing diagnostic tests for AIDS, Hepatitis, Dengue virus and Alzheimer’s disease to assist in the building of an Australian diagnostic export industry.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The CRC supports research programs for the generation of novel reagents and devices based on either proteins or nucleic acids. Initially the protein-based devices will design and produce genetically engineered antibodies as the core re-agents with unique target specificity and affinity. The nucleic acid-based program will develop DNA amplification and hybridisation technology.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Several of the participants have been working closely in collaborations which have led to the development of a number of diagnostic technologies, some of which are currently exported. Examples include the SimpliRED diagnostic kits for HIV produced by CSIRO and AGEN Biomedical Ltd and several diagnostic antibodies developed by CSIRO and Bioclone Pty Ltd.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The world clinical immunodiagnostic market is estimated at $10 billion per annum with similar estimates for veterinary diagnostics. The member companies of the CRC capture selected market niches (both domestic and international) for their diagnostic products.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
In excess of 30 per cent of the Commonwealth funding is going to Victorian-based institutions in the 1995-96 financial year. This percentage is expected to increase significantly. Victoria is a key node primarily due to the scientific expertise of CSIRO and La Trobe University.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
Programs have been planned that encompass undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, technical training courses and major international conferences. The CRC intends to become a central node for the dissemination of diagnostic expertise in Australia.
<P>
<H3>Participants</H3>
Queensland University of Technology, CSIRO Division of Biomolecular Engineering, La Trobe University and the Kolling Institute for Medical Research are participants. Commercial partners are Agen Biomedical, Bioclone Australia, PanBio and Silenus Laboratories, all of which are members of the Australian Diagnostic Manufacturers Association.
<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
Options for commercialisation will first be given to the core commercial partners, then to the Australian members of ADMA, then to other Australian or international companies.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The CRC has total funding of $14.256 million over a seven-year period. Funding in the financial year 1995-96 is $1.056 million with $2.2 million in 1996-97 and subsequent years.
