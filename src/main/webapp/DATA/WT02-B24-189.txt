<B><I>FINANCES</I></B>
<ul>
<li>Just as Surrogate Mothers give a gift to a couple, the couple needs
to give something back.
<li>Traditional (Artificial Insemination) Surrogates receive $15,000, and
Gestational (In-Vitro Fertilization) Surrogates receive $12,000. The surrogate
mother receives these amounts over the course of the pregnancy.
<li>Medical expenses are paid by the couple.
<li>Additionally, there is a $500 maternity clothing allowance and our surrogates
receive monthly reimbursement checks for expenses relating to participation
in the program, such as childcare, lost wages, mileage, phone calls, etc.
In the event of a high-risk (i.e., multiple) pregnancy, the surrogate mother
is taken care of.
</ul>
<P>
<B>COUNSELING</B>

<P>Each surrogate mother is assigned to a specific counselor, who will
provide ongoing support and guidance throughout the surrogacy process. Every
month, our surrogates attend a group support meeting where they meet with
other surrogate mothers in their area. The Center believes that it is very
important that each person involved in the surrogacy relationship is taken
care of, therefore, not only the surrogate mother, but also her spouse and
children are taken into consideration during screening and participation
in the program.
<br>The counseling team also does a psychological evaluation on both the Intended
parents to determine their appropriateness for surrogacy. Those couples who
the Psychologists do not feel are appropriate are not accepted by CSP's program.
<P>
<B><I>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS</I></B>
<P>The Center only works with women who are:

<UL><LI>between the ages of 21 &amp; 35 years.
<LI>mothers already.
<LI>not receiving any form of government assistance (such as AFDC.)
</UL><P>Surrogate mothers must also be given medical clearance from an
infertility specialist and be screened by a member of the counseling team
affiliated with CSP.
