no longer shaped like an 18-year-old, it's impossible to find
a pair of jeans that fit." He smiled and reassured me that
Levi Strauss has a solution up its sleeve (or cuff, as the
case may be). The company is experimenting with jeans tailored
precisely to the customer's body shape, for a small extra fee.
I haven't visited the Manhattan store that offers the service
yet, but I will. It's no wonder Levi's jeans have been so popular
for nearly 150 years: The company understands--and reacts to
-its customers' needs.

Keeping the mass-market customer satisfied doesn't come quite
as naturally to the leading computer companies, many of which
are still getting used to the idea of becoming household names.
Their marketing efforts have long focused on businesspeople,
engineers and scientists, whose needs are much more specialized
-and predictable--than the consumer at large. That helps explain
why most computers look alike; gray or beige boxes with giant
hard drives suited the traditional buyer just fine--isn't that
what consumers want, too? Truth is, there's no telling what
"consumers" want, because there is no monolithic "consumer"
community.

But several companies are beginning to take their thinking beyond
the traditional box--literally and figuratively.  Computer
industry stalwarts including Oracle, Sun, Compaq and Apple have
begun talking in earnest about a new $500 consumer appliance,
essentially a limited-function computer.  This machine would
forgo the "more, more, more" philosophy of memory, storage and
software, instead housing just enough technology to perform the
specific functions a customer needs, such as accessing the
Internet and perhaps downloading programs--needed to, say, edit
text--from the global computer network temporarily.

While it's doubtful these projects will be lightning bolts that
make computers as common in American homes as TVs, they do
show a healthy desire among manufacturers to design products
for different types of computer users. As it is, many of us
use only a fraction of the power and sophisticated capabilities
of our home computers. Of course, some people want a Ferrari
engine, even if they rarely drive over 65 mph; today's PCs
suit them just fine. But for people who shy away from computers,
an inexpensive, easy-to-use device could be the place to start.

Indeed, in an industry that traditionally craves "bigger, better,
faster," it's instructive that in our cover story, the Consumer
Lab on printers (page 181), our jury's top nods often went
not to the models whose print quality floored them, but to
those that offered high quality and a price that didn't go
through the roof. Sometimes, less is more.

Other companies are rethinking computer style Gear + Gadgets).
Their new machines, with sleek angles and innovative shapes, look
more like furniture than office machines and recall a fundamental
principle of design:  Form follows function.  Before long, for
instance, we could see PCs built into some new kitchens, fitting
with the decor of the microwave, oven and dishwasher.  Either a
touch screen will offer a menu of options, or, better yet, we'll
use voice-recognition software to request a recipe while pulling
the ingredients out of the refrigerator.  (To see how two
families have redesigned their kitchens to accommodate today's
PCs, turn to page 174.)

Will $500 PCs be a step toward making home computers as ubiquitous
as toasters? I doubt that day will come as quickly as PC makers
would like; historically, people are slow to embrace change
-consider that automated teller machines were introduced 20
years ago, yet less than half the U.S. population uses them
today.

That's the same reason I think the media is jumping way ahead
of the public when it comes to cyberspace. Some breathless
reports would have us believe Americans' TVs will soon be buried
in cobwebs, abandoned as we race off to surf the Web, engage
in electronic chats and shop at our PCs. Novelty always makes
for an exciting story, but there are still far more people
who've never gone on-line than those who log on regularly.

As usual, however, a kernel of truth lies under the hype. New
research from FIND/SVP and Grunwald Associates shows that nearly
two-thirds of children in U.S. homes with PCs watch less TV
because they're using computers; the figure rises to nearly
three-fourths in homes with multimedia computers. For a new
generation, going on-line is becoming routine; many youngsters
-and adults--are creating home pages on the World Wide Web.

Perhaps the most exciting thing about the Web is that it's the
ultimate customizable medium--anyone can shape it to his or
her own needs. It's similar to the lesson I believe companies
will need to learn in order to succeed in home computing: One
size rarely fits all, and a custom fit is a welcome addition
in any marketplace.

Letters: From 'phobe to Wordphile



I was delighted to see the way you summed up my story in your
November 1995 issue ("Computerphobe Contest Winners: Atlanta
Brave," page 166). It was beautifully written, a perfect blend
of empathy and humor, and it expressed my feelings and fears
precisely.

Ask me how I'd rate my computer skills these days, and I'd confidently
tell you, on a scale of one to 10, about a three--not long
ago, my answer would have been zero.

I owe my progress to on-the-job training; I now sit in front
of my PC from morning to night, Monday through Friday, and
sometimes on the weekends as well. The machine and I both are
getting quite a workout.

I dare say my trepidation has turned into camaraderie, and while
I initially approached the computer with hesitation, I now
sit down, push the button to turn it on, and get right to work.
The only program I've learned how to use so far is Word for
Windows, but from little acorns grow mighty oaks, or so I've
been told, and I am not discouraged in the least. I have learned
that the frustrations I face when using the PC aren't nearly
as debilitating as the fears, and though I am often overwhelmed,
my heart doesn't skip a beat anymore when a warning appears
on the screen.

Thanks to all of you for offering the contest--I have won so
much more than just a computer system.

Letters: Give OS/2 its due



Were you really surprised at the results of the operating system
comparison in your November Consumer Lab ("Not Bad, Rookie
 Windows 95 Wins Our Jury Over," page 175)? I think I could
have easily predicted that a Windows product would come out
on top when everyone on your test panel had some experience
with Windows and no one had ever used OS/2 Warp. Perhaps a
better name for the article would have been "Windows Users
Like Windows 95," because the exercise verified that what people
like best is what they are most familiar with.

I hope that when your readers are shopping for an operating
system, they are more objective than your magazine chose to
be.

Karen Buros

Austin, Texas

Editor's reply: In fact, several of our testers had used OS
2 Warp prior to their experiences in our Lab; we did not include
that information in their bios because no one had used it as
his or her preferred operating system (although the OS/2 Warp
review mentioned that one tester had previously switched from
the IBM operating system to Windows for Workgroups). Final
grades aside, as we reported, many testers had positive comments
about OS/2 after using it, as well as criticisms. On balance,
this group found Windows 95 easier to use.

Another computer magazine? I figured I'd give HomePC a chance,
just to see if it was any different from the rest.

Was I surprised! I opened my first issue of HomePC and found
Dr. PC addressing a reader's memory parity errors (August 1995),
a problem I'd been having with my own system but hadn't been
able to solve.

After reading Dr. PC's advice, I opened my computer case, re
seated all the SIMMs in their slots, and voila, problem solved!
Thanks, Dr. PC--you saved me at least $100.

Letters: Look before you leap



After reading about upgrades in the September 1995 issue of
HomePC ("The Upgrade Dilemma: Can Your PC Be Saved?" on page
85), I decided to upgrade my 486SX 25-MHz PC, an IBM PS/1,
using an Intel DX4 75-MHz OverDrive processor. I reviewed the
reference material that came with my computer, and checked
the PC's motherboard to familiarize myself with my system before
buying the new component. It looked simple enough, so I decided
to go ahead.

When I received the new processor, I eagerly read the installation
manual and reviewed the diagnostics program included with the
processor. I correctly installed the component only to be met
with a "cache error" message when I booted up. My programs
ran worse than before the upgrade.

I removed the OverDrive processor, then contacted IBM support.
I was informed that my PS/1 was incompatible with the DX4 OverDrive
processor, and serious problems could result if I tried to
run my computer with it installed.

I urge anyone planning an upgrade to check with the computer's
manufacturer to make sure the system is compatible with any
new components before buying and installing them.

Roger A. Cohn

Pine Plains, N.Y.

Editor's reply: Generally, Intel's OverDrive processors will
work in the system categories for which they're intended, but
many variables come into play in selecting the right chip for
your particular machine. As you noted, it's always wise to
check with your computer's manufacturer before making a purchase.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: Customizing Win 95 is child's play

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I've read that Windows 95 will let me set up custom desktops
for each member of my family who uses the computer. How can
I do this?

A: Building custom desktops in Windows 95 is a snap. First,
design a rough desktop that would work for all the members
of your household who use the PC. Shuffle the icons around
until you find a basic arrangement that seems logical. Then,
make sure all your programs are listed on the Start menu. If
any programs are missing, use a Windows 95 file-management
tool--either My Computer or Explorer--to drag the icons for
the missing applications onto the Start button.

Now, open the Windows 95 Control Panel and double-click on the
Passwords icon; you'll see two options at the top of the next
window. The first tells Windows 95 to use the same desktop
each time the computer starts up (this is the setting that
is currently active on your PC). The second tells the system
that more than one person will use the PC, and that Windows
95 should present each with a different desktop. Switch to
the second option.

Two check boxes will appear in the lower half of this window.
The first, "Include desktop icons and Network Neighborhood
contents in user settings," tells Windows 95 to keep track
of the different desktop icon arrangements for you and, say,
your kids; if you're connected to a network, it will do the
same for your network icons. This check box will already be
selected, since you chose the multiuser option. The second
check box, "Include Start menu and Program groups in user settings,"
instructs Windows 95 to show specified menu items and program
groups for each user; select this as well, and then click on
OK. At this point, you'll be asked if you'd like to restart
your computer. Click on Yes.

When the system reboots, a log-on window will appear as soon
as Windows 95 finishes loading. Type your name, and enter the
password you'd like to use. Windows 95 will ask you to confirm
your password by typing it a second time. When your password
is accepted, the basic desktop you set up earlier will appear
on the screen. You can now arrange its elements any way you
like, and the only way anyone will be able to use this desktop
-or rearrange it--is to enter your name and password at the
log-on prompt.

To set up a custom desktop for your kids, restart your PC, enter
a new name in the log-on window (for example, your child's
name, or a generic ID like "Kids"), supply and confirm a password,
and you'll return to the default desktop, which you (or the
designated user, once you pass along the name and password
you entered) can now modify. To see what some custom desktop
setup screens look like, see "A Visual Guide to Windows 95
Shortcuts," which you'll find after page 306 in the November
1995 issue of HomePC.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: This logo's got to go

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I've got a graphic I'd like to substitute for the Windows
logo that appears when I boot up my computer. Will Windows
3.1 let me swap my preferred image for the standard logo?

A: You bet. To do so, you'll need graphics software that can
work with .rle files, which are compressed graphic files. (One
popular program that fits the bill is HiJaak Pro from Inset
Systems.)

First, look in your Windows system directory (C:\windows\system)
and locate the vgalogo.rle file, which contains the Windows
logo that you want to replace. Rename this file as, say, oldlogo.rle,
and save it, just in case you change your mind later and decide
to put it back as a startup graphic.

Next, use your graphics program to open the file you want to
use for your personal logo and save it in the C:\windows\system
directory as vgalogo.rle. This puts your new graphic in the
right place--but now you'll have to update win.com, the Windows
3.1 program file, to make it aware of your new image.

Open Windows' Main program group and double-click on the Windows
Setup icon. Pull down the Options menu and choose "Change system
settings." When the settings window opens, note the name of
your current video driver--you'll need to know it to finish
this setup.

Your next step will be to change the video driver's specification
temporarily. Click on the down-arrow button next to the video
driver and choose VGA from the list. This will change Windows'
video driver to VGA, but, more important, it will force win.com
to re-read the vgalogo.rle file you've just modified.

Click on the OK button, and you'll be prompted to restart Windows
-but don't do that yet. Instead, click on the Continue button,
and follow the steps outlined above to put your video-driver
setting back to what it was before.

When the setting is restored, you can exit Windows and restart
your computer. When you do, the graphic you chose should be
there to welcome you back to Windows--it'll greet you at each
startup until you decide to change it again.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: Going to pieces over file fragments

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I've been told that I should fix the file clusters on my
hard disk so the disk isn't fragmented. When I run the DOS
Defrag utility, it tells me I've got lost clusters, but it
doesn't help me solve the problem. What's wrong--and what can
I do to fix it?

A: DOS stores files in sets, known as clusters, or file allocation
units, which are fixed blocks of space on your computer's hard
disk. A single file can take up many individual allocation
units, and DOS tracks them with directory structures and an
index called a file allocation table (FAT)

Each time you work at your PC, files are created and deleted,
and existing files may change size. Your computer won't necessarily
store a particular file in consecutive units of disk space
as changes occur; instead, it chops up the file into fragments
it places into various clusters across your hard disk.

When you instruct your computer to open a file stored in pieces
scattered all over your hard disk, your operating system has
to comb a lot of disk space to retrieve all the parts, which
slows system response. You can improve your PC's performance
by "defragging" the disk--in other words, rearranging the fragmented
data on the hard disk so that it's again contained in contiguous
units. To run DOS's Defrag utility, simply type defrag at the
DOS prompt.

However, when a file isn't saved properly--for example, if your
PC's power is cut off while you're saving a file--the units,
or clusters, to which the file's pieces are assigned won't
be linked to the name of the file; they're considered "lost."
The file's information isn't gone--it's still on your hard
disk--but the operating system can no longer associate those
clusters with a particular file. For the defragging procedure
to be effective, you must first eliminate any lost clusters
on your hard disk--otherwise the Defrag utility has to work
around them.

To do this, use the ScanDisk utility (in DOS 6.2 and later versions;
type scandisk at the DOS prompt) or the Chkdsk utility (in
earlier versions of DOS; type chkdsk at the prompt). If the
utility finds any lost clusters, you'll be given the option
to convert them into files for further inspection or delete
them. Check your DOS documentation to determine the best answer
for your situation.

To keep your hard disk in peak condition, you should defrag
it every week or so. However, be sure to run ScanDisk or Chkdsk
first to make the process as effective as possible--and to
be sure your PC performs as efficiently as it can.

These steps work for Windows 3.1 and DOS, but not for Windows
95; the new system has a different defragging utility. For
instructions, see "A Visual Guide to Windows 95 Performance
Boosters," which appears after page 444 in the December 1995
issue of HomePC.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: PC-phone has a nice ring to it

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I'd like to use my PC as a telephone, but suppose I do this
and I'm put on hold for a long time? Can I connect my modem
to my PC's speakers so that I'll know when someone finally
picks up at the other end?

A: Most modems incorporate a speaker that allows you to hear
dial tones, busy signals or connection signals as the device
attempts to link up with another computer. But this speaker
cuts off as soon as the connection's made, which means you
need a separate device to use your computer as a speakerphone.

To hear what's going on over the phone line, you'll want a telephony
card--a single device that typically combines a sound card
and modem. These cards, which cost about $250, include connectors
for speakers, a microphone and a telephone line; most are sold
with software that will give your computer more-advanced features
such as a speakerphone, voicemail capability, and even caller
ID, if it's available in your area.

If your PC is already equipped for multimedia, it's a good idea
to have your local computer dealer install the telephony card.
This device will replace your existing modem and sound card,
so you may need some extra hardware if your CD-ROM drive is
connected to the sound card; installation could be a bit of
a juggling act.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: CD? Can I make mine E?

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I recently added a second hard drive to my PC, which runs
Windows 3.1. The new drive is labeled C, and my old hard drive
is now D; how do I label my CD-ROM drive E?

A: Editing your PC's autoexec.bat file will do the trick; you
can use Windows' Notepad program in the Accessories program
group to get to it.

Before you start, though, it's essential to make a backup copy
of your current autoexec.bat file. Once you've done that, locate
the line that reads C:
\MSCDEX.EXE / 
/L:D. This is Microsoft's CD-ROM driver; one of its jobs is
to tell the operating system how to refer to your CD-ROM drive.
In our example above, 
and 
indicate variables that will differ depending on how your system
is set up. But don't worry about those; the /L: at the end
is your focus.

If it reads /L:D, as in our example, it's telling the driver to
refer to your CD-ROM drive as drive D, which is common.  To
change it to drive E, just replace the D with an E, so that the
line reads C:\<directory>\MSCDEX.EXE /<options>/L:E.  Save this
file, reboot your computer, and your mission will have been
accomplished.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: See my chip--& raise it?

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I have a 486/DX2 PC. My friend says that DX2 chips can't
be upgraded to Pentium class. Is that true?

A: Don't necessarily believe everything that your friends tell
you. If your PC's motherboard has a ZIF socket--and nearly
all DX2 computers do (check with the manufacturer if you're
not sure)--you can buy an Intel Pentium OverDrive processor
that will boost your 486 to Pentium-like speeds. Mind you,
you won't get the blindingly fast performance that a top-of
the-line P100, P120 or P133 chip delivers, but it will be quicker
than what you have now. A Pentium OverDrive processor will
boost a 50-MHz DX2 PC to about 63 MHz, slightly faster than
the slowest Pentium machines; a 66-MHz DX2 can be jolted to
83 MHz. (For a complete look at the difference an OverDrive
processor will make in a particular system, see Gear + Gadgets,
November 1995.)

Before you purchase an OverDrive chip, check with your PC maker's
technical-support department or call Intel (800-538-3373) to
confirm that you'll be buying the correct processor for your
system, and to find out if you'll need to upgrade your computer's
BIOS (basic input-output system) in conjunction with the chip
upgrade.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: When bad graphics happen to good PCs

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I have a 486/66 SLC2 PC with 8 megabytes of memory. When
I play action games like Descent, the graphics are slow and
choppy. Can you suggest a way to improve the quality of the
screen images?

A: There could be several causes of your problem. First, check
your documentation or call your video card manufacturer to
be sure you have the latest video drivers for your card.

If that's not the difficulty, your computer may be loading unnecessary
programs when it starts up, eating into the memory available
for your games. For instance, many DOS games have built-in
disk-caching technology, which saves frequently used data in
memory rather than forcing the system to go to the hard disk
constantly to retrieve that data. In this case, DOS disk-caching
drivers such as SmartDrive, which normally improve performance,
just get in the way.

For the best image quality, you should run your DOS games from
a clean boot disk that doesn't load all your PC's drivers.
One way to do this is to boot off a floppy you've set up as
a game boot disk (see "Memory Not Included" in the December
1994 issue of HomePC). Or, if you're using DOS 6.0 or a later
release, you can simply press the F8 key when "Starting MS
DOS..." is displayed during your PC's startup routine. This
instructs DOS to ask for confirmation of the startup drivers
as they load (just hit "Y" for yes if you want DOS to load
each particular driver). Be sure that you load your memory
managers (himem.sys and emm386.exe), as well as your mouse
driver (mouse. com or mouse.sys) if you need to use the mouse
to play your game.

If the game requires sound or CD-ROM support, such step-by-step
loading of drivers can get tricky, since you may not know offhand
exactly which drivers you'll need. In that case, I'd recommend

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: Lost in DoubleSpace?

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I have a 386SX 25-MHz computer with an 85-MB hard drive that
I'm using with DoubleSpace. Can I install Windows 95 without
removing DoubleSpace?

A: Disk compression utilities, including DoubleSpace, DriveSpace
and Stacker version 2.0 or later, won't stop you from installing
Windows 95--but it may not be worth the trouble.

If you decide to try it, first make sure you have at least 1.5
megabytes (MB) of free space on your primary hard drive. If
you plan to use a permanent swap file--which boosts performance
by letting your PC use a portion of your hard drive as extra
memory--make it at least 8 MB. Check your Windows documentation
to learn how to set up a swap file on your computer, or how
to adjust the size of the one you already have.

Even with a swap file, though, your setup is going to pose some
problems for Windows 95. For example, to load the operating
system, you'll need at least 40 MB of free hard-drive space
(more if you're not upgrading from an earlier version of Windows,
or if you want to use programs written specifically for Windows
95), and at least 8 MB of RAM for Windows 95 to run efficiently.
You may also have a hard time finding Windows 95 device drivers
for the older video and other peripheral cards you probably
have in your computer.

My advice? Skip the upgrade; you're better off putting the money
you save toward the purchase of a new PC with Windows 95 preinstalled.

Ask Dr. PC--Home Remedies You Can Use: I need directory assistance

By:
Sean Fulton

Q: I created a directory called QTW11 -D on my Windows 3.1 PC,
and now I want to delete it. But no matter what I do, I just
can't make it go away. Help!

A: You're having trouble deleting the directory because the
DOS command that removes directories, rmdir, can't handle names
that have spaces in them; rmdir regards a space as the end
of the directory name. You're going to have to do some fancy
footwork to get it to recognize the name of the directory you
cite.

To convince rmdir that the space is just another character,
you have to use a special three-digit code as a stand-in for
the space within the directory name. Go to the DOS prompt and
type: rmdir qtw11, then hold down the Alt key and press 255
on your numeric keypad. When you release the Alt key, you'll
see a space on the command line. Type the rest of the directory
name, -D, hit Return, and DOS will delete the offending directory
from your hard drive.

Best Buys--Super Values For Savvy Shoppers: Begin piano lessons with 2 C-notes

By:
Jennifer Triverio

Have you ever thought about taking piano lessons, but worried
you'd spend more time thinking about missed bank notes than
musical ones? If so, the Piano Discovery System has the perfect
pitch; it promises an affordable and fun way to learn to tickle
the ivories with help from your PC.

The $199 system includes a four-octave MIDI musical keyboard
that plugs into your PC's sound card through a single cable
(no additional power supply or equipment required) and a Windows
3.1 CD-ROM. The disc includes 200 lessons--the equivalent of
a year's worth of piano instruction--designed for newcomers
to the keyboard from age 6 on up.

The program is arranged in six sections: Go to the Schoolhouse
to learn the basics of piano technique and music theory; the
Bungalow to practice songs; the Arcade to exercise your developing
skills in three video games; the Performance Hall to play with
a virtual symphony orchestra; the Jam Stage to experiment with
sound effects, riffs and rhythms; and the Recording Studio
to work out your ideas and hear them played back by a fully
equipped 16-track MIDI recorder.

If your practice sessions are a hit, you can call for an encore
 Discs covering the second and third years of piano instruction
cost $79.99 each.

Best Buys--Super Values For Savvy Shoppers: Piquing kids' interest in investing

By:
Jennifer Triverio

You're never too young to start saving for a rainy day. Liberty
Financial's free Young Investor Game (DOS) encourages youngsters
to manage their money wisely by educating them about economics
and finance as they play.

In this one- or two-player game, available directly from Liberty,
kids wend their way around a board on the screen, answering
questions and earning (or losing) money as they go.

Topics include the stock exchange, mutual funds and the IRS
(midway through the game, the program announces it's April
15--and unceremoniously takes 28 percent of the player's earnings)

The answers are fully explained, and some might even open a
few adults' eyes: For instance, did you know that if, from
the day of your birth, someone invested $13 a month for you
in a mutual fund with a 10 percent annual yield, you would
be a millionaire at age 65?

Granted, education isn't the only item on Liberty's agenda;
the disk plugs the Young Investor Program--designed to convince
kids and their parents to invest in the Liberty-owned SteinRoe
Young Investor Mutual Fund. Then again, making money is the
name of this game.

Plug 'N' Pray--Windows 95 Plug-and-Play promises automatic hardware
installation, but it doesn't always work that way. Here are
five hints to help.

By:
Phillip Robinson

Imagine three people sitting side-by-side in front of computers.
On the right is Bob, who's content with his Macintosh. Sure,
he knows there's much more software available for PCs than
for his Mac, but when he bought a new modem and scanner, he
simply clicked twice on the Install icon, and they were up
and running in no time.

On the left is Debbie; her PC runs Windows 3.1. She loves all
the new software she can buy, but new hardware's another story.
She knows replacing her 14.4-Kbps modem with a 28.8 model would
make surfing the Internet twice as much fun, and a faster graphics
card would let her see the 3-D animation in the latest games,
yet Debbie just can't forget how hard it was to install her
sound card. She spent hours moving DIP switches, setting up
jumpers, running configuration programs, fiddling with memory
management utilities, guessing what IRQs, I/O addresses and
DMA channels were...and then, after all that, it still doesn't
work right some of the time.

In the middle sits Kim. She's excited about her new PC, which
she bought with Windows 95 installed. She can run most of the
same Windows programs Debbie enjoys, plus all the new software
that's designed just for Windows 95. Kim isn't worried about
hooking up her printer and monitor to the PC, or adding any
new hardware she wants to buy in the future; after all, Windows
95 has Plug-and-Play. When she wants to install hardware, all
she has to do is plug in the device, click on the Add New Hardware
icon, and Windows 95 will automatically find it, set it up
so it won't conflict with other devices, and install any files
she needs to get it up and running.

Just like a Mac.

But Kim might be in for a surprise. Even with her new computer
and Windows 95, she won't necessarily be able to install hardware
automatically.

Apple has been working for more than 10 years with a fairly
small group of manufacturers that design hardware for the Mac;
as a result, it's been relatively easy for the company to enforce
its standards for its machine. Microsoft, which introduced
Plug-and-Play support in Windows 95 less than six months ago,
has been working with chip-maker Intel and PC hardware manufacturers
to develop Plug-and-Play standards for only about two years.
Then, consider that there are far more peripheral devices available
for the PC than for the Mac, and that these devices come from
many different manufacturers, all of which work independently
of Microsoft--the phrase "trying to herd cats" comes to mind.
It will take years before all PC manufacturers conform to the
Windows 95 standards.

For now, when Kim--or any other Windows 95 customer--uses Plug
and-Play, the PC may find and set up some peripherals just
fine, set up other devices for mediocre performance, and not
recognize a few others at all. That's why some technology analysts
refer to Plug-and-Play as "Plug-and-Pray."

Even so, most PC users will have an easier time installing hardware
with Windows 95 than they ever did before. But if you use the
new operating system and your CD-ROM drive is running at half
the speed you expected, or your monitor isn't displaying images
at the high resolution you thought you paid for, or your sound
card isn't working at all, prayer probably won't make the device
run more efficiently; the following five hints will.

Make sure you have a Plug-and-Play BIOS.

To make the most of Plug-and-Play, you may need to upgrade your
computer's basic input/output system (BIOS). Stored on a ROM
(read-only memory) chip, BIOS software starts your PC, loads
the operating system and then hands control of the PC over
to it. The BIOS also contains the instructions that activate
all your peripheral devices. A Plug-and-Play BIOS helps your
PC understand what hardware is plugged in, and it works with
Windows 95 to coordinate the setup of those devices.

If you bought a new PC from a major manufacturer during this
holiday season, odds are it will have a Plug-and-Play BIOS.
If you bought a PC earlier in 1995, chances are good that it,
too, has this type of BIOS.

But if you bought your PC in 1994 or earlier, it's likely your
computer doesn't have a Plug-and-Play BIOS. If you're not sure,
call the manufacturer's technical-support line. Or, on many
PCs, you can press F1 (or another key or keys; check your manual)
while your computer is booting up to see its setup screen,
which displays the BIOS version your PC uses, as well as other
information about your computer.

If you don't have a Plug-and-Play BIOS, or if you suspect there
might be a newer version that simplifies hardware installation
for Windows 95, call your PC manufacturer to explore the possibility
of upgrading your ROM chip. (If your PC is very old, you may
not have the option to upgrade to a Plug-and-Play BIOS, though
you'll probably be able to run Windows 95.)

Some PCs use a "flash ROM BIOS," a special kind of ROM chip
that lets you update the BIOS software without replacing the
chip. Again, check with your PC manufacturer. If you have a
flash ROM BIOS, you can get an update on disk from the manufacturer,
or perhaps download it from an on-line service.

If you don't have a Plug-and-Play BIOS and can't upgrade to
one, you can still reap some of the benefits of Plug-and-Play.
For instance, in many cases Windows 95 sets up peripherals
such as a sound card, CD-ROM drive or printer automatically.
On the downside, it may not recognize start-up devices such
as a hard drive, floppy drive or keyboard controller. You'll
have to set these up yourself, which requires the answers to
some technical questions from the hardware manual or the manufacturer.

If you're buying a new PC, ask if its BIOS supports Plug-and
Play, and don't take "No" for an answer. Better still, the
reply should be, "Yes, it's an ESCD Plug-and-Play BIOS." That
means the BIOS creates an Extended System Configuration Data
list of any tricky changes you may have had to make manually
to set up devices that Plug-and-Play couldn't handle on its
own. This list is stored on the BIOS chip, which retains the
information when you turn off the PC, or even through a major
system crash.

Buy Plug-and-Play peripherals.

Windows 95 will try to install any peripheral you add, but it
works best with hardware that's designed to support Plug-and
Play; such devices identify themselves to Windows 95 and tell
it what they need to run properly. Unfortunately, many of the
peripherals in stores now--and most of those you probably own
already--were not designed for Plug-and-Play.

How do you know if a device supports Plug-and-Play when you're
shopping for new hardware? There's no independent testing service
for Plug-and-Play compatibility, so the only way to be sure
is to look on the peripheral's box for Microsoft's seal of
approval: "Designed for Microsoft Windows 95." A manufacturer
may claim that its product is "Plug-and-Play compatible," but
be skeptical, because such a claim without Microsoft's label
likely signals two things: The manufacturer believes the product
is easy to set up, and it declined to pay Microsoft a fee to
test it to make sure. Before you go shopping for hardware,
ask for a list of products approved by Microsoft from its customer
service department (800-426-9400), its forum on CompuServe
(Go MSL) or its World Wide Web site (http://www.microsoft.com)

Get the latest drivers.

Drivers are programs that help your peripherals and computer
understand each other. They're like translators at the U.N.
-without them, no communication occurs.

Windows 95 includes drivers for the most popular peripherals.
Drivers written specifically for particular devices obviously
deliver the best possible performance for those models, because
they adapt to and implement the devices' most sophisticated
and advanced features.

Some drivers will work with a number of different peripherals.
For example, Windows 95 includes drivers for the popular Hewlett
Packard ink jet printers; these drivers will work with most
ink jets from other manufacturers, too, because they follow
standards set by Hewlett-Packard. Similarly, most modems can
pretend to be a Hayes modem, and most sound cards can use drivers
designed for the Creative Labs Sound Blaster.

Windows 95 tries to assign a specific driver to each device.
If it can't find one, it looks for a compatible generic driver.
If it can't find even that, it will tell you so and ask for
a disk with a suitable driver. (Most new peripherals are sold
with a floppy disk that contains such a driver.)

If the disk includes a 32-bit Windows 95 driver, use it (check
the manual or call the manufacturer to find out)--it will probably
give you even better performace than the generic drives that
are built into Windows 95. If one of your older devices has
just a 16-bit DOS or Windows 3.1 driver, you're better off
using Windows 95's generic 32-bit drivers if you can; if those
don't work, your only choice may be to use the 16-bit driver
you've got on the disk.

If you're installing an older peripheral device, call the manufacturer
to get the latest version of the driver. The company will send
it to you on disk, or tell you how to download it from an on
line bulletin board. Again, a specific 32-bit Windows 95 driver
is best, but if you must use an older 16-bit Windows 3.1 driver,
make sure it's the latest version. A new driver for your device
most likely will have fewer bugs and work better with other
new hardware and software.

Ask the Wizard.

When you have the latest drivers, you're off to see the Wizard
-a Windows 95 feature designed to help you through peripheral
installation. Plug in the device, then click on the Windows
95 Start button, highlight the Settings options, click on the
Control Panel, then double-click on Add New Hardware to bring
up the Add New Hardware Wizard. Click on the Next button, then
click on Next again to instruct Windows 95 to find your device.
If the Wizard finds your peripheral, it will try to install
the appropriate driver.

If Windows 95 can't find your hardware, it will ask you to click
on Next to install the device manually. When you do so, you'll
see a list of hardware types: CD-ROM controllers, display adapters,
video and game controllers, and so on. Click on the type of
device you're trying to install, then click on Next.

For most types of devices, you'll see a list of manufacturers.
Click on the one that made your device; then click on the particular
model. If the manufacturer and model aren't listed, it means
Windows 95 doesn't include a specific driver for that device.
You now have two choices: You can choose a compatible or generic
driver (look in the device's manual or call the manufacturer
to see which of Windows 95's built-in drivers you should use),
or you can install a new driver supplied by the device's manufacturer.

To install the driver, click on Browse, locate the driver on
your floppy disk or CD-ROM, and then click on OK. Windows 95
will copy the driver to your hard drive and add its name to
its Registry file of drivers. The Wizard will also add a line
about the driver to the autoexec.bat and config.sys files if
it's a 16-bit DOS driver. If Windows 95 doesn't find the driver
on your floppy disk or CD-ROM, run the Windows 3.1 Install
program, which you should find on the floppy or CD-ROM. Then,
restart Windows 95 and return to the Add New Hardware Wizard.
The driver should now be on your hard drive.

If you're installing a device that isn't made for Plug-and-Play,
you may see a message that tells you the device conflicts with
hardware already in your PC. This is the toughest nut to crack.
It means some other peripheral has already laid claim to a
resource--an I/O port or memory address--that the device you're
trying to install needs for itself. The more devices you have
that aren't made for Plug-and-Play, the greater the chance
of such conflicts.

Do a little troubleshooting.

To see which device conflicts with the one you're trying to
install, go back to the Control Panel, double-click on the
System icon to bring up the System Properties window, then
click on the Device Manager tab. You'll see a generic list
of all the hardware hooked up to your PC. A "+" next to a device
means you can click on it to see its model name and manufacturer.
An X through a device icon means it's been disabled. A circled
exclamation point through a device icon indicates a problem.

Double-click on any device icon that has an X or an exclamation
point to get some details about the nature of the conflict
between this device and the one you're trying to install. Under
the General tab, you'll see the type, manufacturer and version
of the device. You can also read about its status, including
any problems. Under the Driver tab, you can see the version
and location of any driver the device uses. Under the Resources
tab, you'll see the resources the device is using: I/O ports,
memory addresses, interrupts (signals to the processor to stop
doing other work and turn to this device) and so on.

If you know your way around a PC, you can assign the memory
addresses and other resources each non-Plug-and-Play device
should use. But remember, if you make the wrong choices, your
device may not work, or you may even risk freezing your computer;
in most cases, your best bet is to call the device's manufacturer
for technical support.

To find a complete list of the resources your devices are using,
click on the Computer icon at the top of the Device Manager
list and then click on the Properties button. If you want help
in assigning resources, double-click on the Start button, click
on Help, then double-click on Troubleshooting. Here, you can
click and double-click your way through a variety of suggestions
on what to look for, and get some guidance concerning resource
assignments.

Once the device is installed, make sure it's working at peak
levels. Go to the Control Panel and double-click on the icon
for the device (if you can't find it there, you may find it
under the System icon). Then click on the Properties button
to see if the device is set for maximum performance. It probably
will be, but sometimes a generic driver assignment or another
glitch can affect the setting. In that case, you can adjust
many of the settings simply by clicking on them. (For tips
on how to do this, see Nuts + Bolts on page 215.)

If you heed the five points above, you'll help Windows 95 recognize
and install hardware, whether or not it's designed for Plug
and-Play. As a Plug-and-Play BIOS becomes more common in PCs
and more peripherals are designed for Windows 95, PC owners
can indeed look forward to the easy installations Mac users
enjoy. Now that will be the answer to a prayer.

Setting Your Sites On The Web--All the world's your stage when
you create your own home page on the Internet; it's easy to
do--just follow our guide as you go.

By:
John Eckhouse

Jenny and Andy Wood love funky old American motels with flashy
neon signs. After living overseas for two years, Lisa de Araujo
developed a lingering fascination for all things Italian. Zoli
Nazaari-Uebele collects Barbie dolls and desperately wants
to fit one with a Pan Am stewardess outfit. Seven-year-old
Emma Bowen, who has a delightful English accent, hopes to visit
Legoland in Denmark again next summer.

I've never met any of these folks, yet I feel I know them well.
They've all told me about their hobbies, shared some of their
secrets, shown me family photos and even spoken to me. How?
Jenny, Andy, Lisa and the others all have "home pages" on the
World Wide Web, the multimedia section of the Internet you
can navigate with the click of a mouse button. All you need
is a Web connection through a commercial on-line service or
an Internet service provider, and Web browser software.

Think of a home page as a cross between an autobiography and
a billboard. It's the front door to the information you post
that dwells on the Internet. Once visitors enter, they'll see
whatever information you choose to share with them--perhaps
something about you, your family, your occupation or your hobbies.
You can include photographs, sound, even home movies. You can
also highlight certain words--called hyperlinks, or links,
for short--to provide instant one-click access to other pages
you've created, or to pages you like that were designed by
other people.

IN THE BEGINNING

Until 1994, most home pages were created by computer enthusiasts
and college students with lots of time on their hands. Some
pages were witty, many were informative--but most were about
as engrossing as watching mold grow on stale bread. One guy
posted a list of all the musical tapes in his collection; another
filled his page with a roster of all the computer classes offered
at his university--and one desperate soul posted a photo of
his toenail clippings. Many pages looked like ransom notes,
overflowing with randomly chosen type sizes and styles, and
gaudy colors.

But as new software made Internet access easier, more people
began discovering the Web--a fact that didn't escape the notice
of corporations and advertising agencies, which soon began
exploring, too. Slick promotional sites and virtual stores
began popping up in short order, featuring glitzy pages with
sharp photos, sounds and videos. After seeing the possibilities,
more individuals began investing the time to create enticing
home pages. Today, you can find everything on the Web from
the daily news to health tips to video clips of windsurfers
to a self-published book titled 54 Ways You Can Help the Homeless
(for a small sampling of the variety of home pages on the Web,
see the examples beginning at left)

Equally important to the boom in personal home pages is that
they've grown increasingly easy to produce. It no longer requires
a computer-science degree to create a home page using HyperText
Markup Language (HTML), the standard format for writing Web
pages; a little time, a dash of creativity and the right software
will do just fine. Take it from me: I know nothing about programming
or design, yet in about seven hours, I created my first six
linked pages on the Web.

My main page is called Cyber Ace, the name of the back-page
column I write for HomePC. On my Web pages, I created hyperlinks
to an autobiographical page, a page describing the Cyber Ace
column, a page featuring a photo of my family's kittens and
two pages describing my experiments with HTML code. There are
also nine links to other Web sites that are related to my life
in some way.

My pages won't win any design awards, but I'm proud of them.
There's no better way to entertain, inform or introduce yourself
to a worldwide audience at this price; just follow the steps
below, which outline the way I set up my own home page, and
you, too, can get entangled in the joys of the World Wide Web.

LOOK FOR INSPIRATION

Before starting your home page, look at what others have done
by clicking around existing home pages. Jot down notes on the
styles you like and the addresses (called Uniform Resource
Locators, or URLs) of attractive pages so you can go back later
for a closer look. Don't be shy about borrowing good ideas
you see on the Web--in cyberspace, imitation is the sincerest
form of flattery.

While there's no "right" way to design a home page, it's a very
good idea to include a few common elements: a title, a message
explaining what the page is about, brief biographical information
and a photo, a main topic, links to other Web pages and a way
for visitors to comment. If you have more than one page, it's
good form to put a link at the bottom of each page that will
take a visitor back to your home page with a single click.

MAKE A PLAN

Once you've toured Web sites, sketch out a basic layout for
your page on paper. What's the title? What's the first thing
you want visitors to see? Then what? Should you include a table
of contents? How will you link your pages? Do you want to include
photos and color graphics?

CHOOSE YOUR TOOLS

There are two easy ways to build the content of your page. You
can use a word-processing program with an add-on HTML converter,
which lets you compose your page in English and then, with
the click of a button, convert everything to HTML code. Or,
you can use an HTML editor, which lets you enter the proper
HTML coding--called tags--using a pull-down menu or keyboard
shortcuts. (For a sampling of software options, see the box
below.)

I chose an HTML editor, because it let me preview my work as
I went along. Also, it let me learn a little about HTML; I
picked up what HTML tags do pretty quickly, which let me type
in new tags--say, to align words by a photo--that may not yet
be included in the conversion programs. To create my pages,
I used a program for the Macintosh called BBEdit, which is
available for free on the Web. I picked up additional tips
from some Web sitesand a few books.

BREAKING THE CODE

Once you begin, you'll notice that virtually every HTML command
begins and ends with a tag inside the "less than" and "greater
than" symbols:  < >.  The only difference between the starting
and ending command is the addition of a slash (/) to the latter.
For example, every page on the Web begins with the tag <HTML> and
ends with </HTML> .  (Commands within the symbols are usually
written in capital letters.)  These tags tell a Web browser how
your page should look when viewed on a screen.

Two commands you'll see frequently are <BR>, which breaks type
over two lines, and <P> , which breaks type over two lines and
adds a line space in between.  You don't need an end tag after
either of these commands.

NAME YOUR PAGE

Pick a title for your home page; it will appear in the title bar
at the top of your Web browser.  To name my page Cyber Ace, I
typed this:  <TITLE>Cyber Ace</TITLE>

It helps readers know what they're looking at if you place a
graphical heading or title in large type across the top of
your page; most often, it's the same as the title of your page.
Basic HTML lets you use six text-heading levels--the type size
decreases as you go from level 1 to level 6. Just as a larger
newspaper headline generally flags a more important story,
larger headings typically signal the major sections of your
home page. A good rule of thumb is to put your main heading
in H1, then use smaller sizes for subsequent headings.

For my page, I spread the headline over two lines, making the
second line a bit smaller than the first.  I used a pull-down
menu in the software to create the HTML tags for the heading
sizes.  In HTML code, it looks like this:  <H1>The Cyber
Ace</H1><H2>"Your On-Line Tour Guide"</H2> 

After applying the HTML code, I found it helpful to check out
what it looked like through my Web browser, just to make sure it
delivered what I had in mind.  After every few lines, I saved the
document and looked at it using the Preview command.  After
giving my headlines the once-over, it seemed to me they'd look
better centered on the page, so I added a center tag before and
after the text.  And since HomePC holds the trademark to the name
Cyber Ace and the logo illustration, I consulted one of my
guidebooks and found that I needed to type "(r)" immediately
after the word "Ace" to get the symbol to appear.  Putting it all
together, here's how the headline looked in HTML:  <CENTER><H1>The Cyber
Ace(r)</H1><H2>"Your On-Line Tour Guide"</H2></CENTER>

CREATE HYPERLINKS

If you have a large home page, you may want to create a table
of contents on top with hyperlinks to the sections visitors
will find below. You can also link to other Web pages you've
created or any other Web page you like.

Don't go overboard when you designate hyperlinks from your home
page. Some people make virtually every word on their page a
link, which is offputting to visitors. Similarly, designate
only a few words as a link, rather than a whole sentence--it
works just as well from the reader's perspective, and it's
easier on the eyes.

For my first attempt, I put a direct link to my e-mail address.
There are many ways to do this, but I selected a command known as
"mailto" because it calls up a preaddressed form visitors can use
to send me e-mail.  To link to my e-mail address, I created an
HTML reference to it using a command known as HREF, then
"anchored" the whole thing using the <A> and </A> commands.
Trust me, it's less complicated than it sounds.  Here's what it
looks like:  Send questions and comments to:  <A HREF=
"mailto:eckhouse@cerf.net"></A>The Cyber Ace

When viewed through a browser, it shows up as "Send questions
and comments to The Cyber Ace"; the last three words are highlighted
in blue. A click on these words calls up a mail form addressed
to eckhouse@cerf.net.

Next, I added links to the HomePC home page and the Cyber Ace
column within HomePC's site:  
<A HREF="hhtp:/techweb.cmp.com/techweb/hpc/current/18cyberspace.
html#cyberace">December</A>

When a visitor clicks on the blue underlined word "December,"
they'll jump to my column.

USE HOT BUTTONS

You can also use a graphic as a hyperlink--called a hot button.
A click on the image whisks a visitor to another Web page.
For instance, on my autobiographical page, I added the Cyber
Ace graphic as a link; clicking on it calls up my Cyber Ace
home page. To do this, I created an "image tag" for the graphic
by typing in the location of the artwork in relation to the
HTML document on my server. It looks like this:
<IMG SRC="cyberace.gif">

This image tag must be included inside the opening and closing
parts of an anchor tag, along with a reference that tells
visitors where they'll go when they click on the link.  The image
of the Ace on my page takes visitors to the page named
cyberace.html.  I could align the words explaining this to
visitors with the top, middle or bottom of the graphic.  I wanted
the words centered, so I added the command "ALIGN=middle" to the
following line of code:  <A HREF="cyberace.html"><IMG
ALIGN=middle SRC="cyberace.gif"></A> Return to the Cyber Ace page

ADD SOME COLOR

A page without artwork won't draw much attention from visitors,
so add some icons or color graphics, or scan in your own drawings
or photos. Most of the images you see on the Web are stored
in the GIF or JPEG format. The software included with most
home scanners and graphics programs gives you the option to
store images in one of these formats.

Note just how much disk space each image you include demands
from your computer. On a Web page, the more large files, photos
and graphics you use, the longer it takes your page to come
into view on a visitor's screen--and the higher the risk readers
will grow impatient and move on. If you post a large photo,
store it on a Web page by itself and link to it from your home
page. Next to the link, let viewers know how large the file
is to give them an idea of how long it will take to appear
on their screens. This helps them decide whether it's going
to be worth the wait.

For artwork to spice up your page, stop at the HTML Goodies
Page (http://www.cs. bgsu.edu/~jburns/gifs.html), where you
can stock up on icons, buttons, arrows and other graphics.
You can also pick up GIF files of colorful textured and patterned
backgrounds at The Background Sampler (http://home.mcom. com
home/bg/backgrounds.html). I replaced the standard gray background
on my home page with a tan texture by storing a GIF file on
my hard drive and writing an HTML command calling for it just
under the title command of my Cyber Ace page:
<BODY background="WIND_PAP.GIF">

WATCH FOR TYPOS

If you're adding a background graphic, be sure to type the file
name exactly as it's stored. I typed the file name in lowercase
when it was written in capital letters, and it took me 10 minutes
of trial and error to figure out why the background wasn't
showing up on my page. I also discovered the hard way that
many Web servers can't recognize certain characters in file
names, such as exclamation points, ampersands and spaces.

STORE FILES WISELY

It's a good idea to store all your files--say, a few Web pages
or one home page and several graphics--in one folder on your
computer; this makes it easier to organize your files for a
Web server, a computer set up to send pages to other computers'
browsers on request. Give your graphics the proper designation,
such as a .gif or .jpg file-name extension.

Also, if you have more than one file, you need to give the main
home page--the intended starting point for visitors--a designated
file name or extension, which will depend on the Web server
you're using. For example, you may need to mark the main home
page as .default.html, .home.htm or .index.htm. This lets the
Web server know which page to dish up first when a browser
asks for your file.

USE A CHEAT SHEET

If you don't know the HTML code for a particular style, just
copy it from someone else's home page. Every page on the Web
contains the construction blueprint of HTML codes that were
used to create it. Simply go to the View pull-down menu on
your browser and click on Source.

ADD A TEXT-ONLY OPTION

Not everyone on the Web has a browser that can view graphics,
and some people turn off the graphics in order to speed up
their flights around the Web. Also, many HTML commands work
only with the popular Netscape Navigator browser; people using
other browsers might not be able to see images on your page.
It makes sense, therefore, to offer visitors a text-only version.
It took me just a few seconds per page to delete the graphical
commands.

DISCOVER NEW TRICKS

There's a lot more to HTML, if you're interested. I learned
how to make words blink, add pull-down menus and install a
device to count the visitors to my pages. I posted samples
on my practice page--drop by and view the code at http://techweb.cmp.com
hpc/jeckhous/ experimental.html.

FIND A WEB SERVER

After you create your home pages, you'll need to post them on
a Web server. If you wish, you can set up your own Web server
at home, but it's much easier to buy space on someone else's.
Most Internet service providers rent space, as do some of the
commercial on-line services. You can find a list of Internet
service providers on the Web at http://thelist.com/.

The fees for storing Web pages vary, so shop around. Expect
to pay no less than $25 a month for about 5 megabytes of disk
space--ample room for several pages. Check to see if there's
a charge each time you change your pages. Most likely, you'll
use the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) feature of your browser
to upload pages to your Internet service provider.

When your Web pages are complete and stored on a Web server,
your welcome mat is out and you're ready to invite the world
into your cyberspace home. Let friends know about it through
e-mail, postings in on-line discussion groups and any other
way that comes to mind. Speaking of which, drop by my completed
page (http://techweb.cmp. com/hpc/jeckhous/cyberace.html) and
let me know what you think.

Paging The Web For Advice

By:
John Eckhouse

The best place to get the latest scoop on how to create a Web
page is the World Wide Web itself. New techniques and styles
appear so quickly that books and software just can't keep up.
Here's a look at some helpful on-line sources.

A Beginner's Guide to HTML

http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/ html-primer.html

What better place to start than the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications, where the first Web browser was created less
than three years ago? This guide is a terrific primer for people
trying to understand HTML.

The Bare Bones Guide to HTML by Kevin Werbach

http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/barebone.html

Even if you think you know what you're doing, you'll want to
keep this guide by your side as you create Web pages. It's
more of a "cheat sheet" than a manual--and a resource you'll
refer to again and again to find the HTML coding you need.

Creating a Home Page

http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/ netizens/construction.html

Here's a simple, concise, step-by-step guide to creating a basic
home page with links and graphics. It teaches you how to use
HTML without forcing you to understand exactly what the arcane
commands mean.

Webmaster Reference Library

http://www.corpnet.com/~aking/webinfo/

Aimed at everyone from aspiring HTML authors to Web professionals,
this site offers links to more than 550 other pages that provide
information, tutorials and tools. 0--J.E.

Page-Turners (Literally)

By:
John Eckhouse

Whether you're a Web novice or a veteran Net surfer, bookstore
shelves are overflowing with titles that will help you create
your own Internet home page. Here are four of my favorites.

Build a Web Site by Net. Genesis and Devra Hall (Prima Publishing;
$34.95)

Intermediate and advanced Web users will get a helping hand
here; it's especially useful if you know the Unix operating
system and want to set up a Web server.

HTML for Dummies by Ed Tittel and Steve James (IDG Books; $29.99)

Explore the basics of the Internet, the World Wide Web, and
acronyms like SLIP, PPP, MPPP, HTTP and HTML before learning
how to design and build a Web page. The book includes a disk
with a number of Web documents and a hyperlinked list of all
the Web pages mentioned in the printed text; if you have a
Web browser, you can view those pages with a click of your
mouse.

HTML Web Publisher's Construction Kit by David Fox and Troy
Downing (Waite Group Press; $36.95)

This book works best as a reference for people who already know
a bit about HTML coding and just need some tips on creating
graphical tables, customized shaded lines, bullets and other
frills. (You can skip the first section of the book and move
immediately to Part II: Creating Web Pages.) It includes a
CD-ROM loaded with software and tools to create your own Web
site.

Teach Yourself Web Publishing with HTML in a Week by Laura Lemay
(SAMS Publishing; $25)

Novices will find this delightful, well-illustrated primer a
breeze to follow. Don't miss the chapter on the do's and don'ts
of Web page design. And if you care to learn more about HTML,
it's packed with instruction explaining the more advanced features.

Pix To Click--PHOTO LIBRARIES ON CD-ROM. Focus in on discs with
striking photos that liven up birthday cards, fliers, reports
and more in a flash.

By:
Tony Roberts

A picture is worth a thousand words, folks say, so imagine how
eloquent you'd be if you had hundreds of professional photographs
at your fingertips. You could jazz up your music newsletter
with the image of a saxophone, give your sales presentation
a boost by adding a slide of the space shuttle blasting off,
even add sparkle to your screen saver with dazzling shots of
a fireworks display.

Like clip art and display fonts, color photos add flash to your
newsletters, reports or presentations. And now that photo collections
are available on CD-ROM, it's easy to find just the right picture;
a single disc can hold more than 1,000 images. If you want
to add spice to your cooking newsletter, choose a gallery with
photos on a single theme, such as fruits and vegetables. The
images in a disc of general photos, meanwhile, can come in
handy for everything from birthday cards to business fliers.

Many CD-ROM photos can be imported directly into your desktop
publishing, graphics or presentation program, but others require
special software before you can use their images. (For tips
on how to make sure the collection you choose is compatible
with your software and hardware, as well as your needs, see
"Formats in Focus" on page 138.)

Most photo CD collections are royalty-free, which means you
don't have to pay an additional fee to use an image from the
disc in any document or item you create for personal use. Your
child can go wild putting shots of lions in his or her school
report on nature, and you can use the photos in greeting cards,
newsletters and, in many cases, advertising, promotional materials
and business presentations--although some collections restrict
the number of pieces you can print using any single image.
You may even be able to use them in commercial products, such
as calendars or T-shirts, but you'll have to get permission
first. Other restrictions might also apply, so when you're
working on a project that could run afoul of your license agreement
-say, a print ad or a World Wide Web site--do some research
to be sure it's fair use.

Remember, the images included in any CD-ROM collection reflect
the skill and artistry of the photographers involved; quality
varies. On the following pages, you'll see some of the CD-ROM
color-photo libraries we feel are sure to make you smile.

First exposures

The variety of pictures--2,500 images spanning 88 categories,
including Agriculture, Fashion, Health Care, Occupations, Nature,
Religion, Sports and Transportation--and a price that's hard
to beat make PC Paintbrush PhotoLibrary a good way to start
your digital photo collection. The low-resolution images on
this two-disc set--stored in both TIFF and BMP formats--work
best as quarter-page shots, or you can use them with the Windows
Wallpaper option or the After Dark screen saver to decorate
your desktop. To help you find the perfect photo for any project,
the package includes the Power Album for Windows and Fetch
for the Mac, both of which let you browse thumbnail-size screen
images or search by keyword.

$49 (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Softkey, (800) 323-8088, (617)
494-1200. 

Postcards from the edge

Every picture tells a story, so let PhotoDisc's ClipPix help
you get your tale across in your next multimedia presentation.
The 500 photos--covering Business, Nature, Holidays, Objects,
Backgrounds, People, Landmarks and Sports--can add style to
the substance of any pitch. The images, stored in BMP and TIFF
formats for the PC and PICT for the Macintosh, are tailor-made
for do-it-yourself screen savers; use them at postcard size
or smaller for the sharpest printed images. The disc includes
software for browsing the images on screen, or you can refer
to the included card of thumbnail photos.

$149 (DOS, Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from PhotoDisc, (800) 528
3472, (206) 441-9395. 

A touch of class

Textured backgrounds from the Artbeats collection can give any
document or presentation slide an impressive finish. A marble
design on the cover of your financial proposal, for example,
immediately tells investors you mean business. Titles include
Marble & Granite, Marbled Paper Textures, and Leather & Fabric;
each comes with 40 high-resolution TIFF images for use in professional
documents, and 120 PICT files that perk up slides or World
Wide Web pages. The packages are pricey, but if they keep your
projects from fading into the background, it's money well spent.

$349 each (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Artbeats, (503) 863
4429. 

A precious natural resource

Would a bee's-eye view of an orchid help promote your gardening
club's fund-raiser? How about a shot of the towering California
Redwoods for your environmental group's annual report? If so,
Nature Scenes is a natural: You'll get 100 photos of deserts,
forests, lakes, icebergs, flowers and more, stored in the Photo
CD format. Nature Scenes is part of the 325 CD-ROM Corel Professional
Photo Series; each disc focuses on one topic, and includes
a printed card for quick reference, plus software for viewing
the images and using them as screen savers. They're sold individually,
or you can choose from 13 prepackaged "libraries," each with
25 discs.

$14.95 for individual discs, $149.95 for each library (Windows
3.1, Macintosh) from Corel, (800) 772-6735, (613) 728-8200.

Arty facts

The next time you want to re-create a page from the past, try
one of the timeless images from the Classic PIO Library. A
photograph of a vintage radio might be a turn-on for readers
of your antiques digest. Or perhaps including a picture of
an old scooter on your garage-sale flier will get the customers
rolling in. The six discs in the collection, sold separately,
include Business Equipment, Entertainment, Microphones, Nostalgic
Memorabilia, Radios and Telephones. Each contains two views,
in high- and low-resolution TIFF formats, of 20 objects photographed
at 20th Century Props, one of Hollywood's largest prop houses.
If you don't need 20 images of, say, microphones, there's also
a Sampler that has various items taken from the other discs,
including cameras, clocks, high heels, hula dolls and jukeboxes.

$69.95 each (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Classic PIO Partners,
(800) 370-2746, (818) 564-8106. 

Strokes of genius

You may never paint like Rembrandt or sculpt like Michelangelo,
but with Planet Art's Classic Graphics collections, the masters
themselves can add a touch of artistry to your projects. Choose
from among the works of Botticelli, Raphael, Van Gogh, and
the Dutch Masters, or from Japanese Art, Antique Maps, Textiles
of India and more. Each of the 28 discs has 100 high-resolution
Photo CD images. So let Leonardo da Vinci illustrate the literature
for your local medical society's annual conference, or choose
a Renoir for your school's art-fair poster--it's sure to make
an impression.

$89.99 each (DOS, Macintosh) from Planet Art, (800) 200-3405,
(213) 651-3405. 

Made in the cliched

Don't settle for dull documents when you can throw in everything
-including the kitchen sink. PhotoDisc's Metaphorically Speaking
spices up your projects by adding original photographic takes
on stock phrases. Is your glass half empty or half full? Are
you stuck behind the eight ball, working like a house afire,
comparing apples and oranges? Do you want to tip your hat to
someone special? The disc contains more than 100 images in
Photo CD format, plus a useful reference card. If you don't
want to put all your eggs in one basket, PhotoDisc has three
volumes of images of Everyday Objects, plus Just Hands, Just
Tools and Just Documents.

$149 each (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from PhotoDisc, (800) 528
3472, (206) 441-9355. 

Giving you the business

If you've ever spent hours hunting for an appropriate photo
to illustrate a company brochure or report, you'll value Images
of Business (Vol. 2) from Image Club's PhotoGear collection.
The disc contains 100 photos, including a telephone, a briefcase,
a globe, cluttered desks, shaking hands and corporate bodies
in motion, with several views of some subjects. There's a handy
reference card to help you find the image you want. Files come
in high- and medium-resolution TIFF formats, plus low-resolution
PICT format. You can also pique people's interest with PhotoGear's
MountainScapes (Vol. 5) or brighten your backgrounds with SkyScapes
(Vol. 6)

$59 each (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Image Club, (800) 661
9410, (403) 262-8008. 

A landmark collection

Interesting angles, creative cropping and vibrant colors make
the images in Digital Stock's Building and Structures perfect
for those who need--and can afford--top-quality architectural
photos. The disc contains 100 Photo CD images of Gothic cathedrals,
skyscrapers and other structures. Landmarks such as the Taj
Mahal, the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame are included, and the
unknown churches, barns and brownstones are charming. If you're
laying the foundation for a professional photo collection,
Digital Stock also has discs on Indigenous Peoples, Animals,
Business & Industry and more.

$249 each (DOS, Macintosh) from Digital Stock, (800) 545-4514,
(619) 794-4040. 

They shoot, they score!

You'll have a ball using the Stock Clips Sports Equipment collection
to jazz up your football club's newsletter--and you'll score
points with your readers. The disc holds more than 75 images
of everything from caps to cleats and cues to clubs. All have
been photographed on a white background, so they can stand
alone on a page or blend with other photos and designs. The
images, stored in high-resolution TIFF format, can be blown
up to create eye-catching fliers or posters. The disc also
includes Shadow files to create a 3-D effect. If playing with
these images whets your appetite for other titles from Digital
Media, try Food & Grocery Items, or Toys, Models & Game Pieces.

$99 (Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Digital Media, (800) 786-2512,
(714) 362-5103. 

Digital potpourri

Add pizzazz to multimedia, video or slide presentations--or
liven up your screen saver--with Screens & Wallpaper from the
Seattle Support Group. Its 200 photos cover such categories
as Activities, Animals, Farms, Floral, Monuments, Patterns,
Scenery and Still Life. The pictures in Night and Neon--photos
of colorful outdoor signs and dazzling firework displays shot
against a nighttime sky--are unique and exciting. The images
come in various resolutions in BMP format for the PC and JPEG
for the Mac, and an on-screen browser lets you preview the
photos on the disc.

$19.95 (DOS, Windows 3.1, Macintosh) from Seattle Support Group,
(800) 995-9777, (206) 395-1484.

Pix to Click: Formats in Focus

By:
Tony Roberts

Photo libraries are stored on CD-ROMs in various resolutions,
color depths and formats. Here's what you need to know to be
sure a collection will work for you.

* RESOLUTION: All photo images are bit-mapped--that is, they're
scanned and broken up into tiny pixels (dots), which are stored
as digital information; the more pixels per inch, the higher
the resolution. If two photos are the same size, an image with
1,024 by 768 pixels will contain more detail than one with
640 by 480 pixels. Reducing an image packs more pixels in one
square inch and boosts the resolution.

* COLOR DEPTH: This refers to the number of distinct colors
an image can contain. Each pixel is made up of bits of data.
A pixel that has 24 bits can be displayed in any of more than
16 million colors, while an 8-bit pixel is limited to one of
256 colors. Higher resolutions and greater color depths produce
images of better quality. But if your graphics card supports
a maximum of 256 colors, that's your limit, even if you're
working with a 24-bit color image.

* FORMAT: If you plan to print your documents professionally,
your best bet is the Photo CD format, which uses 24-bit color
and provides five versions of the same image, ranging in size
from 128 by 192 pixels to 2,048 by 3,072 pixels; the latter
can be enlarged to the size of a magazine cover and still retain
its sharpness. To open and store Photo CD images in a format
that your word-processing, desktop-publishing or presentation
program can use, you'll probably need image-manipulation software,
such as Adobe Photoshop. You also need at least 16 megabytes
of RAM to work with these images effectively.

Some collections store high-resolution, 24-bit images in TIFF
format, which can be used directly with many Windows or Macintosh
programs that let you import images, or in PICT format for
use with Mac programs. The JPEG format, which supports 8- and
24-bit color, works with both PC and Mac software; these files
are compressed to save hard drive space, and you may need special
software to work with the data.

For most home- and small-business projects--newsletters, fliers,
reports, overhead transparencies and so forth--that will be
output to a 300-by-300- or 600-by-600-dpi color ink jet printer,
low-resolution (640-by-480, for example), 8-bit image files
will do the trick. You can also use these photos for on-screen
presentations, or take them to a commercial service bureau
that can turn them into color slides. These images--which can
be stored in TIFF and PICT formats, and the BMP format for
Windows--contain less data, so you need only 8 MB of RAM to
open and manipulate them. --T.R.

Empowering Tools--Assistive technology gives the disabled community
equal access to computing's benefits.

By:
Lynne S. Dumas

Eleven years ago, a diving accident left Mary-Kay Webster a
quadriplegic. It was a tragic event, but it didn't stop her
from striving to lead an independent, productive life. Today,
with the help of a laptop computer she controls by manipulating
a trackball (she retains limited wrist movement), Mary-Kay
is an accountant for a local business, the Chesapeake Packaging
Company, working primarily from her Richmond, Va., home.

"One of the greatest frustrations since my accident has been
that I can do just one thing at a time," she says. "But with
my computer, I can do three things at once--I can transmit
a report while I write a letter and work on a spreadsheet."

This kind of perseverance with the help of technology is a familiar
story to Joseph Nagler, who runs the Center for Research in
Arts and Medicine at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine
in New York. "Home computers are tremendously empowering,"
Nagler observes. "They promote inclusion and level life's playing
field by helping remove the barriers and stigma that often
accompany a disability."

To reap these benefits, many people with disabilities rely on
special hardware and software, or "assistive technology." Using
these tools, individuals living with a variety of physical
challenges, from arthritis to blindness, can command a PC more
comfortably--or, in some cases, use one when it previously
had seemed impossible.

Jay Leventhal, a 37-year-old New Yorker, has been blind since
childhood. From his early years into adulthood, Jay used materials
printed in braille--not the most hospitable system for a writer
who wants to edit or update his work. Then, 10 years ago, Jay
got a PC equipped with a screen reader; this device works in
conjunction with a speech synthesizer to recite the text that's
on his computer screen, making it easier for him to read, write
and edit.

These days, Jay, who works at the American Foundation for the
Blind's Technology Center, is particularly pleased with the
opportunities on-line connections present. He uses e-mail to
correspond with friends around the world, something that was
difficult or impossible before. "With e-mail and my screen
reading program, my friends no longer have to worry about writing
in a format I can read," Jay says. "And although there aren't
any daily newspapers in braille, now I can connect to CompuServe
and keep informed with Associated Press news reports."

As Mary-Kay, Jay and others with disabilities have learned,
hardware, software and special computer gear can be a tremendous
help in day-to-day living and in achieving personal goals.
Below, you'll find a thumbnail guide to specialized computer
products that can help you or someone you know.  Some solutions,
such as wrist rests, are easy to use and inexpensive; others are
elaborate and pricey.  Before picking a particular technology or
product, consult a doctor, physical therapist or disabilities
expert to make sure it's the most appropriate choice.  For people
in need who can't afford the more expensive products, equipment
donations or grant programs sponsored by government, corporate,
community and religious groups may be an option.  The Internet
and commercial on-line services are also a gold mine of product
information, inspiration and support for people with physical
disabilities page 164)

Each description that follows includes approximate costs, but
bear in mind that prices vary widely. Since few computer stores
stock these specialized products, we include the names of a
few manufacturers in each category.

MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS

Motor problems range from minor restrictions on movement to
complete paralysis. Accordingly, the assistive-technology solutions
cover a wide range of conditions.

* Wrist and arm support

Proper support for wrists--and sometimes arms--can help ease
movement problems at the computer, such as the wrist and hand
soreness that occasionally accompanies a mild case of carpal
tunnel syndrome or some forms of arthritis. Wrist rests and
armrests, available for use with either a keyboard or a mouse,
will help maintain proper positioning.

Prices: $10 to $25 for a wrist rest; rests for the entire lower
arm cost about $125 apiece.

Manufacturers: Bucky Products, (800) 692-8259, (206) 545-8790;
DeRoyal/LMB, (800) 541-3992, (615) 938-7828.

* Keyboards

Special keyboards can help computer users with various disabilities.
Options range from split models designed to make typing easier
on hands and wrists (available at many computer stores) to
specialized alternate keyboards, which can assist people with
more severe movement problems.

--Miniature keyboards

The keys on these models are set very close together, which
allows people with a limited range of motion to use them without
straining.

Prices: $400 to $1,500.

Manufacturers: InTouch Systems, (800) 332-6244, (914) 354-7431;
TASH, (800) 463-5685, (905) 686-4129.

--Programmable keyboards

Using a combination of special hardware and software, these
products let users customize the position, size and function
of individual keys. For instance, someone with a motor impairment
can buy a board that has a few large keys preprogrammed to
perform special functions. Instead of having to type "Hello,
my name is Mary," for example, Mary could assign a key to that
phrase, which would appear on the screen whenever she pressed
that button.

Prices: Range from $250 to $1,700, depending on the level of
sophistication and customization.

Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;
IntelliTools, (800) 899-6687, (415) 382-5959.

--On-screen keyboards

These are not keyboards in the traditional sense; rather, they
are software programs that display a standard or modified keyboard
on the computer screen. Users can control this on-screen keyboard
with a mouse, touch screen or electronic pointing device.

Prices: $100 to $1,200.

Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;
Words+, (800) 869-8521, (805) 266-8500.

* Alternative data-input devices

Sometimes, people who can't use a keyboard or mouse can substitute
computer peripherals that let them control the computer with
a nod of the head, the touch of an elbow or even the sound
of their voice.

--Wands or pointers

The simplest alternative input devices--typically held in the
hand or mouth, or strapped to the head--are used to strike
a regular or alternative keyboard.

Prices: $20 to $120.

Manufacturers: Extensions for Independence, (619) 423-1748;
North Coast Medical, (800) 821-9319, (408) 283-1900.

--Electronic pointers

People with certain motor impairments may find it easier to
use one of these devices--sometimes in the form of a sticker
that can be worn on the forehead, finger or foot. Electronic
pointers allow the user to move the cursor on the screen and
issue commands through ultrasound or an infrared beam. For
instance, instead of striking keys or clicking a mouse, the
individual might manipulate the pointer to choose from sequentially
highlighted on-screen choices. These high-tech pointers work
with special hardware or software that interprets pointer commands
and gives users extensive control of their computers.

Prices: $1,000 to $2,000.

Manufacturers: Ability Research, (612) 939-0121; Madenta, (800)
661-8406, (403) 450-8926.

--Switches

Various parts of the body--for example, the elbow, foot or head
-can control switches to issue computer commands and enter
data. Users can control almost any standard program by employing
a switch that's linked to special software and a device that
translates the switch's commands into information the computer
is able to process.

Prices: $30 to $100; any special interface devices and software
will cost a few hundred dollars more.

Manufacturers: AbleNet, (800) 322-0956, (612) 379-0956; Toys
for Special Children, (800) 832-8697, (914) 478-0960.

--Trackballs

Essentially computer mice turned upside down, these data-input
devices use a movable ball atop a fixed base. (Many laptop
computers have built-in trackballs.) Rotating the ball with
the fingers, chin or another part of the body moves the computer's
cursor and lets some users select from on-screen menus more
comfortably than a switch or pointer allows.

Prices: $100 to $175; trackballs designed for people with particular
disabilities can cost $400 or more.

Manufacturers: Kensington, (800) 535-4242, (415) 572-9675; Penny
and Giles, (800) 554-0220, (508) 226-3008.

--Touch screens

Either attached to or built into a computer monitor, touch screens
for home use are similar to those used in airport information
kiosks and on automated teller machines. By touching the screen
over a particular option--say, to call up a menu item--the
user can see the desired information. In the home, touch screens
are often used along with special software, such as on-screen
keyboards.

Prices: $200 to $2,000; touch-screen overlays generally cost
less than complete monitors.

Manufacturers: Edmark, (800) 426-0856, (206) 556-8400; MicroTouch
Systems, (800) 642-7686, (508) 659-9000.

--Voice-recognition systems

People with severe motor impairments can control computers with
these systems, which combine hardware and software that allow
the user to tell the computer what functions to carry out-
just say "close file" or "print," for example, and the machine
complies.

Some voice-recognition systems handle only a limited number
of preset basic commands. If these are too bare-bones, more
advanced dictation systems may be the answer; these products
recognize an extensive vocabulary of spoken words, allowing
users to perform any number of tasks, such as dictating a letter.

Prices: $400 to $1,000.

Manufacturers: Apple Disabilities Solutions Group, (800) 600
7808, (408) 996-1010; Dragon Systems, (800) 825-5897, (617)
965-5200.

--Word-prediction software

Typically used in conjunction with a word- processing program,
these packages cut down on the number of keystrokes or other
physical motions required to feed information to the computer.
Using a keyboard or alternative input device to specify the
first few letters of a word, the software presents an on-screen
list of choices to complete the thought. For example, the letters
B-E might bring up "bell," "better," "best" and "because."
Choose the right word and the software drops it into the document
on the screen.

Prices: $250 to $700.

Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;
Words+, (800) 869-8521, (805) 266-8500.

HEARING IMPAIRMENTS

Computers set up with "auditory alerts"--such as beeps or bongs
-to relay information pose problems for users with hearing
impairments. There are a couple of easy ways to address this
problem.

If you or someone you know uses a Macintosh, adjust the Speaker
Volume setting (you'll find it in the Sound control panel)
to zero; then, instead of making a sound, the computer will
flash a visual cue. PC users who are running Windows 95 can
make a similar adjustment. (For more on Windows 95's features
for disabled users, see page 160.) For other PC operating systems,
add-in utilities are available to change auditory alerts to
visual cues. These packages generally cost around $20 from
vendors such as Microsystems Software, (800) 828-2600, (508)
879-9000.

SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS

For almost as long as PCs have been in use, people who can't
speak have employed them to communicate more easily, typing
their thoughts at the keyboard. But even with assistive technology,
one of the biggest frustrations in nonverbal communication
is the inability to express a thought quickly. Consider this
 When most of us speak, we deliver our thoughts at a rate somewhere
between 120 and 180 words per minute. How many of us can type
anywhere near that fast? On top of that challenge, speech impairments
can be associated with a range of motor difficulties, such
as paralysis.

Some of the products mentioned above, such as word-prediction
software, can help speed communication for people with speech
and/or motor impairments. And when necessary, computer systems
such as the products mentioned below can literally speak for
these individuals.

* Speech Synthesizers

Several products for people with severe speech impairments work
in conjunction with a speech or voice synthesizer that enables
the computer to "talk." Speech synthesizers are built into
all recent Macintosh models; PC users can buy an internal device
or an external synthesizer that plugs into their computer.

Prices: $100 to $400, but advanced models with output that more
closely resembles a human voice can cost as much as $2,500.

Manufacturers: American Printing House for the Blind, (800)
287-4204, (502) 895-2405; Echo Speech, (800) 377-3246, (805)
684-4593.

* Conversation software

Used primarily with portable computers equipped with a speech
synthesizer, these programs let people with severe vocal impairments
"speak," whether they're at home or out on the road with a
notebook. As a result, it's easier for nonspeaking individuals
to participate in social conversations; they can initiate dialogues,
answer queries and make jokes with the tap of a key. For instance,
by clicking on a screen icon or choosing a menu option, a user
can command a computer-synthesized voice to say "Hi, how are
you?" Some programs allow the user to type in more extensive
information--for example, an account of how he or she spent
the weekend--and store the anecdotes until the user is ready
to play the speech back for a friend.

Prices: $100 to $500.

Manufacturers: Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682;
Microsystems Software, (800) 828-2600, (508) 879-9000.

* Talking word processors

Combining a word-processing program and a voice synthesizer,
these programs repeat text aloud after it's been entered into
the computer.

Prices: $100 to $500.

Manufacturers: IntelliTools, (800) 899-6687, (415) 382-5959;
Don Johnston, (800) 999-4660, (708) 526-2682.

VISUAL IMPAIRMENTS

In addition to the talking word processors, voice-recognition
systems and speech synthesizers mentioned earlier, the following
technologies can help people with partial or total vision loss
take advantage of the best that computers have to offer.

* Screen-enlargement programs

These programs may prove helpful for people with diminished
vision by magnifying computer-screen text and graphics to make
it easier to read. Individuals simply run this software in
conjunction with a word processor, spreadsheet or other software
program. Be aware, though, that even when used with a large
screen monitor, essential information can be pushed off the
viewing area when the text is enlarged. Before selecting a
screen-enlargement program, it's a good idea to check with
the manufacturer or seek the advice of someone familiar with
the program who knows how it works with specific software packages.

Prices: $250 to $500.

Manufacturers: Ai Squared, (802) 362-3612; Microsystems Software
(800) 828-2600, (508) 879-9000.

* Screen readers

Like Jay Leventhal at the American Foundation for the Blind,
people who are visually impaired can benefit from software
that works with a speech synthesizer to read aloud whatever's
on the screen (including menu options, as well as words and
numbers)

Prices: $150 to $500.

Manufacturers: Berkeley Access, (510) 883-6280; Microsystems
Software (800) 828-2600, (508) 879-9000.

* Braille devices

Refreshable braille computer displays translate what's on the
PC screen into the printed language used by visually impaired
or blind readers. These displays are called "refreshable" because
the braille characters--formed by small, rounded pins--change
to display each line of on-screen text. Another option is a
braille printer.

Prices: $5,000 to $12,000 for braille computer displays; $2,000
to $6,000 for braille printers.

Manufacturers: American Thermoform, (800) 331-3676, (213) 723
9021; TeleSensory, (800) 286-8484, (415) 960-0920.

Empowering Tools: How Windows 95 helps

By:
Maria Behan

Windows 95 includes several features that make it easier for
people with disabilities to use a PC. You'll find these options
in the Accessibility Properties window. To get there, click
on the Start button, highlight the Settings option, click on
Control Panel, then double-click on the Accessibility Options
icon.

The Accessibility Properties window has five tabs. Here's a
look at some of the options each makes available.

* Keyboard: StickyKeys lets people who type with one finger
or a mouth-stick press one key at a time to issue commands
that usually require the simultaneous pressing of two or more
keys, such as Alt+Tab. FilterKeys can help those who have trouble
with unintended keystrokes; it instructs Windows 95 to disregard
keystrokes that aren't held for a specified amount of time.

* Sound: The SoundSentry lets you substitute a visual cue for
an audible alert. ShowSounds enables programs that use digitized
speech or other sounds to display on-screen captions instead.

* Display: The High Contrast option allows those with limited
vision to select colors and fonts for easier reading.

* Mouse: MouseKeys lets people with motor problems control the
cursor with the numeric keypad instead of a mouse.

* General: The SerialKey option makes it easy to attach special
equipment, such as an alternative keyboard, to a PC's serial
port.

Tasteful Surroundings--Drop Into Your Kitchen For A Byte

By:
Ellen Frankel

Two years ago, Nina and David Spiegelman moved their young family
from a cramped New York apartment to a spacious house in suburban
Westchester. Even though their center-hall colonial is a roomy
3,000 square feet, Nina, a full-time homemaker, knew she'd
be spending a good part of her day in the kitchen, so she and
David decided to remodel the room and create a multipurpose
"family" center. As part of that plan, the couple felt it would
be the perfect spot for the family computer.

"We could have put the PC in one of the children's rooms, or
in our den or basement playroom," Nina explains, "but it made
more sense to us to place it in the kitchen, where it's so
easy for all of us to spend time together."

The Spiegelmans--like the Johns, who are profiled on the next
page--hit on an old idea that's gaining new popularity among
families remodeling their homes: using the kitchen as a magnet
for family activities, the room to which everyone in the house
gravitates after going their various ways each day.

A 20-BY-30-FOOT KNOCKOUT

To remodel their kitchen, Nina and David annexed the adjoining
breakfast room and back porch to create a roomy 20-by-30-foot
space. The multimedia PC and printer sit on a built-in desk
next to the wall oven. A cushioned bench forms an L with the
desk, providing a cozy corner with comfortable seating; the
cabinets underneath store software, board games, toys and sports
equipment. The large windows in front and to the right of the
PC reveal a lovely view of the garden and the woods beyond.

The house's traditional style dictated the choice for the kitchen
cabinets--a warm champagne finish on maple. Both the desk and
the built-in seating are made from matching, stock kitchen
cabinets; brass hardware and Laura Ashley fabrics complete
the mood.

"One of the best things about having the PC in the kitchen,"
says Nina, "is that opportunities pop up for all of us to learn
new computer skills from each other." Nina, formerly in magazine
ad sales, and David, a TV executive, use the PC for personal
correspondence and to manage household finances. Their sons,
Sam, 6, and Ben, 31/2, play with educational software. Looking
ahead to their school years, Nina foresees that "keeping the
PC in the kitchen will be really convenient when the kids need
both the computer and my help to do their homework."

AN IDEA TAKES ROOT ON THE FARM

Sharlette and Bill John hail from Missouri farm families. And
though they've chosen other careers--Sharlette has a real-estate
business, and Bill oversees their rental properties and works
in insurance--they still love the farmer's way of life. For
proof, witness their commitment to one of its venerable traditions
 making the kitchen the hub of family experience.

"When I was a kid," Bill recalls, "the kitchen was the only
room we heated, so we did everything there. We took visitors
to the kitchen, not the parlor. I wanted that for our home.
We had the space to put the computer elsewhere in the house,
but we wanted it to be where everything happens."

When they redid the 450-square-foot kitchen in their spacious
4,000-square-foot home tucked into a rural area near Kansas
City, Mo., Sharlette and Bill chose a contemporary decor, even
though the house, built in 1860, has a charming, old-fashioned
feel. "It's the only modern room in the house," Sharlette notes,
"but we like its clean, crisp look." She modeled the computer
center--an 8-by-8-foot built-in unit with attractive rounded
corners--after a style she saw in a magazine.

The computer center is finished in the same white laminate as
the kitchen cabinets. The PC and printer sit on a desktop;
three shelves above the desk hold software, books, family photos
and knickknacks. They chose a Balans chair, which lets you
sit in a kneeling position, for its ergonomic support.

"When we're finished using the PC, we just shut the unit's folding
doors, and our kitchen is totally neat and tidy," Bill says.
He particularly likes one unexpected benefit of putting the
computer in the kitchen: The family, which includes their children,
John, 17, and Christi, 19, spends less time watching television.
House rules state that when the PC is on, the TV, which is
also in the kitchen, is off. And it seems that one family member
or another is always using the computer. Sharlette often brings
work home from her office, and she lists her properties on
the Internet. Bill uses the PC to track their rentals. And
they both turn to the computer at tax time. John and Christi
stake their claim to the computer to do their schoolwork and
play games.

"In most families," says Bill, "the computer is in one room,
the TV in another, and the kitchen is for preparing meals;
everyone comes home and goes off to a separate place. In our
house, we come home and gather in the kitchen. And that's what
works for us."

firm in New York specializing in home design.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Documentary evidence: rating 13 
printers' value

By:
Sean Fulton

When you need a new printer, the signs are clear--too bad you
can't say the same for your documents. It may be that your
old ink jet wearily spits out a smudged copy of the resume
you've spent hours formatting. Perhaps it dawns on you when
you see your daughter's face after the colorful drawing she
couldn't wait to show you rolls out in black and white on your
monochrome laser printer. Or, the last straw may come when
you're out of aspirin and the rat-a-tat-tat of your cranky
old dot matrix churning out a 30-page report sets your temples
throbbing.

Knowing you need a new printer is easy; knowing which new printer
to buy is trickier. The good news--and part of the reason shopping
for a printer gets so confusing--is that these days, more and
more machines deliver high-quality output for a fraction of
the price you would have paid just a year or two ago.

Whether you're looking for a monochrome laser model that delivers
clean pages of text in a jiffy, or an ink jet that adds brilliant
color to greeting cards, children's homework assignments, business
handouts and other projects, you'll find plenty of contenders,
often priced at less than $500. Even if you need special capabilities
-say, a laser printer that supports the PostScript language
for heavy-duty graphics output--you still may walk away from
the store having paid less than $1,000.

When you start comparing printers, you'll run headlong into
dizzying specifications: resolution, speed, installed memory
and other potentially confusing terms. Each of these features
makes a real difference and deserves your attention, but there
are some things the numbers just won't tell you. For instance,
while it's nice to know that the printer you've got your eye
on feeds 20 envelopes at a time through the machine automatically,
that doesn't mean the unit handles the task well. Some printer
feeders will take your Number 10s, chew them up and spit them
out.

The most reliable way to learn how a printer performs is to
see it in action--and not just in the prepared demos you often
get when you visit stores. That's why we invited 12 people
with varying degrees of computer experience to try an array
of leading printers in our Consumer Lab as if they had bought
them for their own use, and asked them to tell us how satisfied
they were with each unit's performance under real-life conditions.

The 13 products our testers examined--including monochrome lasers
and color ink jets for PC and Macintosh systems--come from
seven of the top names in the printer business. (We chose not
to include monochrome ink jets, as the reasons for buying one
-essentially a matter of price--are disappearing: Printer makers
today offer color ink jets for as little as $20 more than the
monochrome models.)

Most of these companies sell more than one model in each category
we tested, so we asked them to send us the one product in the
line they believe offers the best value for home use. Hewlett
Packard sent different printers for the Macintosh and PC tests,
even though the laser and ink jet models the company designated
for Mac users will work with a PC as well.

UNDERSTANDING THE LINGO

A printer sure would come in handy to generate a cheat sheet
defining the terms you'll see as you do your research and shopping.
Resolution is perhaps the most common characteristic you'll
read about--and potentially the most confusing.

Essentially, resolution tells you how fine an image the printer
can generate. Both ink jet and laser printers produce text
and graphics by placing a series of dots on paper; printer
resolution measures how many dots the machine can fit in a
square inch, horizontally by vertically. The more dots per
inch (dpi), the higher the resolution--and the sharper the
image.

Almost all the printers we tested also include some sort of
"resolution enhancement" technology intended to help smooth
jagged edges on text and line art. How well does it work? Your
eyes are really the best judge; as a general rule, be skeptical
of any claims that such a feature actually increases the printer's
resolution.

The issue of resolution can get even more complicated with certain
variables. For instance, some color ink jet printers may support
enhanced resolution for printing in black and white, but not
in color. Or, some laser printers may be able to give you 600
dpi (shorthand for 600-by-600-dpi) resolution for PostScript
output, but not for documents that need to be translated into
the unit's built-in PCL (Printer Control Language) code, which
many PC users rely on for outputting everyday work.

And consider this: It's theoretically possible for a laser printer
with 300-dpi resolution to produce sharper images than some
ink jets with 600-dpi resolution. An ink jet printer works
by blowing its tiny dots of ink through little "jets" mounted
on a printhead; during printing, some "spraying" typically
will occur, taking a toll on the image's sharpness. In contrast,
a laser printer (or a printer that uses LED technology, such
as the Okidata OL-810e, which our testers reviewed) works along
the same lines as an office copier--a rotating drum picks up
toner, and then "melts" it onto the paper.

Clearly, resolution comparisons get complicated. If it all seems
too confusing, here's a simple rule of thumb that may help
 Without minimizing the importance of understanding and inquiring
about resolution issues, seeing is believing--in a nutshell,
if the results don't show up on the page, the numbers on the
box really don't mean a thing.

Beyond resolution, if you're shopping around for a color ink
jet printer, you should also familiarize yourself with color
correction and color-enhancement technology. Basically, these
features enable the printer's software to analyze the image
it's printing and massage it--for example, it might adjust
the tones and shades of the colors on the page automatically
-so that the printout looks its best. All the color printers
our testers reviewed make these adjustments to some degree;
not surprisingly, some printers implement the feature more
successfully than others. In the category of self-correction,
HP's ColorSmart technology won consistent praise from our testers.

Color ink jet buyers should also know the difference between
"true" and "composite" black. Generally speaking, for a color
ink jet printer, you're better off with a model that supports
true black for your color images, although it may cost more.
Composite black is produced by mixing the cyan, yellow and
magenta inks contained in a printer's tricolor cartridge, and
it tends to look greenish or gray on the page.

DON'T FORGET THE MEMORY

It's also important to consider how much random access memory
(RAM) your printer needs. Laser printers process an entire
page's worth of data internally before they put it on paper,
and so they typically require more memory than do ink jet printers,
which print out pages character by character.

In the past, if you had insufficient memory installed for your
laser printer, you'd risk seeing error messages when you'd
try to print a full page that contained complex graphics, or
other complicated jobs. Printer makers have devised a way around
this problem for most types of documents home users print.
The solution, called memory compression, effectively doubles
the amount of memory your laser printer has at its disposal.

Some manufacturers, such as Panasonic with its KX-P6100, have
elected to strip their laser printers to a bare minimum of
RAM and let your PC handle much of the image-processing work.
Typically, to use such printers (often called Windows or GDI,
for Graphical Device Interface, printers), you'll need a Windows
based PC with a 386 or faster microprocessor and no less than
4 MB of RAM; the more RAM and the beefier the CPU in your PC,
the better the performance you should see in your print jobs.

One advantage of a GDI model is that it may save you some money,
since you don't have to add in the cost of 1 megabyte (MB)
or more of installed memory. Die-hard DOS users may be less
interested in some of the printers that use this technology;
depending on the model, printing from DOS applications isn't
always smooth.

Another point to remember about printer performance is that
the manufacturer's maximum rated speed specifications won't
necessarily be the last word on what a printer can actually
do. The performance you see at home depends on a number of
factors, such as the kind of document you're printing (a page
of text will print faster than a page of graph-

ics, for instance), whether you're printing in "best quality"
or in "draft" mode, and even whether you're working in black
and white or in color. In the latter case, the difference can
be dramatic; a color ink jet that prints as many as four monochrome
pages per minute (ppm) may manage only 0.6 ppm in color. Once
again, always trust your own impressions rather than the manufacturer's
claims.

THE EYES HAVE IT?

With personal experience so crucial to a buying decision, how
can you be sure your experience at the store accurately represents
what you'll see at home? For starters, check that the printer
is outputting sample documents sent from a PC. Many in-store
printer demos hook up an interface box to the printer; you
press a button and the printer outputs a few sample pages.
While this will give you some idea of the machine's print quality,
you won't be able to tell how fast the printer operates when
connected to a real computer, or whether the printer's software
is effective and easy to use. It's important to know, for example,
if the software alerts you with an on-screen message that the
printer's out of paper or there's any other sort of problem;
all the products in this review do so.

Before making a final decision between a color ink jet and a
monochrome laser printer, consider some of the costs that will
arise after your purchase. For instance, most laser printers
handle high-volume use better than color ink jet printers do.
Typically, you'll spend about two

to two-and-a-half cents per page (excluding paper) for laser
output, but a page from a color ink jet--even if the printer
uses only black ink--can cost from three to four-and-a-half
cents. And a page of color output can send your budget reeling
-anywhere from 11 to 27 cents per page, depending on the amount
of color on the page.

Meanwhile, laser printers offer an attractive combination of
high-speed and high-quality output that makes them the printers
of choice in homes or home offices where color printing isn't
a necessity. While some of today's ink jets process black-and
white output at a rate of 4 ppm, laser technology lets a typical
home model send out as many as 8 ppm. (If you're wondering
what it would take to combine the best of both worlds and buy
a color laser for home, the answer these days is at least $2,000
-many color lasers will cost more than that.)

As for your electric bill, most ink jets--even in full operation
-aren't going to add much to your monthly tab, but lasers can
consume a surprising amount of electricity. To help conserve
money and energy, many laser and ink jet printers (including
all the models our testers looked at) adhere to federal Energy
Star guidelines for reduced power consumption. When not in
use, they shift into a "sleep" or "idle" mode that uses significantly
less electricity than the machines burn up in full operation.
(For more information on Energy Star computer equipment, see
"15 PC Sleepers" in the April 1995 issue of HomePC.) The Brother
HL-630 and Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS printers don't even include
on/off switches, since they power down automatically.

HOW THE TESTS WERE RUN

Six of our testers looked at the nine PC printers in our lab,
while six others worked with the four Macintosh products.

We armed the testers with a series of files to be
printed--including documents that combined text, photographs and
line illustrations.  We asked them to check the "smudge" factor
for ink jet printers, feed envelopes through all the machines in
bulk, clock how quickly the printers handled their various tasks,
and perform several other tests that simulate the way people at
home use their printers.  Our testers spent up to six evenings in
the lab; the PC models were connected to AST Advantage Pro P100
systems with 8 MB of RAM; the Macintosh units were hooked up to
Performa 5215CDs, also equipped with 8 MB of RAM.

When the testers reported back to us, we asked them to grade
each model's performance according to various criteria, including
the printer's documentation, ease of installation, design,
noise control, performance, overall value and overall quality.
We also asked them to grade the quality of text and graphics
(such as line art) reproduction, and color/grayscale quality,
which covers how well the printer simulates the tones and gradations
in images such as photos.

In the PC laser printer category, the Panasonic KX-P6100 took
top honors, providing exceptional output at a competitive price.
Among the PC color ink jet models, the OkiJet 2010--the first
ink jet printer Okidata has delivered to the market--took top
grades; the unit just edged out the category's top guns, including
HP's DeskJet 660C.

For the Macintosh, the Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS squeaked by
HP's LaserJet 5MP. Similarly, Apple's Color StyleWriter 2400
pulled in just ahead of the HP DeskJet 850C. In both cases,
however, the grades were extremely close.

Before our testers began to examine each printer, we urged them
to trust what they saw, and their reactions--the same advice
we've given you. But first, take the additional opportunity
to look through their eyes. The reviews that begin on page
200 should help give you a clearer picture of how to frame
your search.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Recycling printer toner cartridges 
turns trash into cash

By:
Jennifer Zaino

Did you know that your printer can help you preserve the environment
-and maybe make your wallet a little greener, too? Just return
your used-up toner cartridges to your printer manufacturer
or an independent recycler rather than toss them into the trash.

Printer makers such as Apple, Canon and Lexmark encourage you
to send back the empty toner cartridges from their laser printers
by paying the shipping costs. For instance, when you buy a
new toner cartridge from Canon, you'll find a postage-paid
UPS return label in the box to send your old cartridge to Canon's
recycling plant. Apple's new toner cartridges include a coupon
that entitles you to a $5 rebate if you return your old, empty
cartridge to the company.

Printer makers aren't the only outfits recycling toner cartridges
-independent companies such as Nashua (800-333-3439), in Nashua,
N.H., pay up to $15 for many brands of used toner cartridges.
Nashua remanufactures the cartridges, then resells them for
Apple, HP and other printers through authorized dealers.

Buying a remanufactured cartridge can save you money--from 30
to 50 percent of what you'd pay for a brand-new cartridge.
Apple also sells remanufactured cartridges directly: The $76
Apple SX Toner Cartridge fits the Apple LaserWriter II series
as well as other devices using the SX engine made by Canon;
it's about $30 cheaper than buying a new Apple toner cartridge
for such printers.

If you buy a toner cartridge that isn't brand-new, ask if it's
remanufactured, rather than simply recharged or reconditioned.
Unlike recharged and reconditioned products, a remanufactured
cartridge is thoroughly cleaned, and all its worn parts are
replaced for better performance and print quality. --Jennifer

to go with her Pentium-based PC at home, but she expects to
buy an ink jet model when she starts shopping around for one.

Thomas DeRosa, 29, is a student. He's satisfied with his current
Lexmark laser printer, but adds that if he were to consider
replacing it anytime soon, price would be his most important
consideration.

Judith Gleicher, 47, is a math teacher; she shares her dot matrix
printer with her husband, Alan (see above)

Steven Russell, 42, is a police officer. He uses a Panasonic
dot matrix printer with a 486-based PC, but he'd like to upgrade
to a new ink jet printer in the coming year.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Panasonic KX-P6100

By:
Sean Fulton

 
#1

A-

HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control: A

LOWEST GRADE: Graphics quality: B+

SPECS: PC laser, 300 x 300 dpi, 6 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Excellent printing

* High performance

BAD NEWS:

* Flimsy output tray

Our testers had no doubts about their favorite PC laser printer
 The Panasonic KX-P6100 took top honors in seven of 10 categories,
including an A for noise control and a B+ for both graphics
and grayscale quality. Its overall excellence, coupled with
an attractive estimated retail price of $399, landed it a lofty
overall grade of A-

In terms of rated specs, this 6-page-per-minute model wasn't
the fastest laser printer that testers saw, but they considered
its speed to be more than adequate. They awarded the unit a
near-perfect A- for performance.

The group also praised the KX-P6100 for being easy to set up
and use. In particular, the testers were surprised at how well
the model printed envelopes, a task that trips up many printers.

Finally, our testers were impressed by the look of the printer
itself, and particularly its conservative use of space. The
KX-P6100 is an upright tower, so it takes up less room on a
desk or stand.

"I'd like to smuggle this one home with me," confessed Genevieve
Early. "It's fast, solid, dependable, easy to use--it's good."

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Okidata OL-810e

By:
Sean Fulton

 
B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Text quality: A

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B

SPECS: PC LED (laser-class), 600 x 600 dpi (text), 8 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Excellent print quality

* Compact size

BAD NEWS:

* High price

The Okidata OL-810e received the top score in only one category
our testers examined (and even that ended up a tie), yet when
the dust cleared, this unassuming, solid performer racked up
enough points to walk off with second place--just barely outpacing
two close runners-up, the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5L and Epson
Action Laser 1400.

For our testers, price was the main difference between the Okidata
machine and the first-place Panasonic KX-P6100. The OL-810e
carries a $799 estimated retail price, which testers adamantly
declared too high, even if the 8-page-per-minute machine was
the fastest-rated PC laser printer they saw.

Our group cited several areas that needed improvement before
Okidata could justify the high price in their eyes. For instance,
the OL-810e took the lowest grade of the five PC laser printers
we tested for its noise control (B). And several testers complained
about cryptic on-screen error messages they received. The unit
also received a B for its documentation, which put it barely
above the bottom of that category. "You'd have to read the
whole thing to know how to do anything," complained Thomas
DeRosa.

On the other hand, the unit shared first place with the Epson
Action Laser 1400 for its clear, crisp text, while it received
a solid B+ for both its graphics and grayscale quality. If
the OL-810e could print the money it takes to buy one, our
testers would have recommended it with no qualms.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5L

By:
Sean Fulton

 
B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control: A

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B-

SPECS: PC laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 4 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Excellent text quality

BAD NEWS:

* Construction seems flimsy

Hewlett-Packard sells more printers than any other company,
and enjoys a well-established reputation for quality. Our testers
rated its LaserJet 5L third best among the five PC laser printers
they tried, awarding it a B+. In numerical terms, though, its
grade was just a hair ahead of the Epson Action Laser 1400
and a mere whisper shy of the Okidata OL-810e's score.

The HP brand name has become almost synonymous with printers;
consider that last year, at least three testers in our Consumer
Lab who had problems getting the LaserJet 4L up and running
still gave it extremely high grades. This year, our testers
faced no such contradictions when they gave the HP LaserJet
5L the highest marks in the PC laser group for ease of installation
and documentation (both A-)

Overall quality was a different story; the HP printer's B in
this area was the next-to-lowest score in the category, largely
on the basis of testers' complaints that its construction seemed
somewhat flimsy.

In the key print-quality categories, the LaserJet 5L scored
an impressive A- from our testers for its text output, but
received only B's for its graphics and grayscale reproduction.

In the final analysis, this model did well, but not well enough
to push it ahead of the Panasonic or Okidata models, even with
the weight of the HP name behind it. The LaserJet 5L may not
be a perfect choice, but it's certainly not a bad one, either.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Epson Action Laser 1400

By:
Sean Fulton

 
B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control, text quality: A

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B-

SPECS: PC laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 4 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Excellent text and grayscale quality

* Prints envelopes well

BAD NEWS:

* Difficult to set up

Don't let the fourth-place ranking of the Epson Action Laser
1400 fool you; a few points here or there, and it could just
as easily have finished in second place, ahead of the Okidata
OL-810e. In its best categories, the Epson laser model tied
with the OL-810e for top text quality (A), and came in a close
second to the Panasonic KX-P6100 for grayscale quality (B+

However, it also took the lowest grade for overall value (B
)--the 4-page-per-minute printer's $499 street price seemed
high to our testers, when 6-ppm printers such as the Panasonic
KX-P6100 cost less. (The same was true even of the slightly
less expensive 4-ppm Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5L, which also
scored a B- for overall value.)

Several testers said they were baffled at how the Action Laser
1400 could handle the tricky job of printing envelopes with
ease, then complicate something as simple as installing a toner
cartridge. "Unlike with the other printers, I wasn't sure how
to line up the cartridge," said Thomas DeRosa. The documentation
wasn't much help; the Epson model tied with the Brother HL
630 PC laser printer for last place in this category (B)

Many testers said if they saw the Action Laser 1400 on sale,
they'd consider buying it; otherwise, they were hard-pressed
to justify the price.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Brother HL-630

By:
Sean Fulton

 
B

HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control: B+

LOWEST GRADE: Graphics quality, grayscale quality, performance
 C+

SPECS: PC laser, 300 x 300 dpi, 6 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Generous paper capacity

* Low price

BAD NEWS:

* It's noisy

* Unexceptional print quality

While the Brother HL-630 came in last among the five PC lasers
we tested, it still managed to muster a very respectable B
grade.

Testers found its printouts acceptable, but not exceptional;
the unit received the lowest scores in print quality for the
PC laser printer group. "This is a good printer, but it's just
not the highest quality you can get," declared Thomas DeRosa.

All the testers liked the model's paper capacity--it holds 200
sheets, more than almost every other PC laser printer in our
tests. On the downside, the HL-630 claims a large amount of
physical space compared with its peers.

Although the B+ our testers awarded the HL-630 for noise control
was actually its best grade, they complained that the printer
was particularly noisy in comparison to the other models in
this group, largely due to the fan inside. All but one other
PC laser printer received higher scores for their ability to
keep the peace and quiet.

Even so, with the right price--it's slightly less than $400
retail--several testers said that they would consider buying
it.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS

By:
Sean Fulton

 
#1

B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Text quality: A

LOWEST GRADE: Grayscale quality: B-

SPECS: Mac laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 4 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* High-quality print

* Rugged design

BAD NEWS:

* Slower than the HP LaserJet 5MP

The two Macintosh-compatible laser printers in our tests were
relatively close in our jury's eyes, with the Apple LaserWriter
4/600 PS nosing out the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5MP in the
end. Ultimately, testers considered the lower-priced Apple
unit to be a greater overall value, even if they were disappointed
by its slower (4-page-per-minute) print speed.

"This would be even better if it were faster," said Bill Egan,
"but I would recommend it because of its overall quality."

Our testers gave the nod to the LaserWriter 4/600 PS over the
LaserJet 5MP for documentation, ease of installation and design
-although, while praising its classic, compact styling and
ruggedness, they complained that having a power-cord connector
behind a door at the back of the unit impedes access. Testers
also wished this model would have supported automatic envelope
feeding; instead, they had to hand-feed their envelopes into
the unit one at a time.

Even though the 4/600 PS falls a little short of the 5MP in
terms of some features and expansion abilities, testers ultimately
decided that if the money were coming out of their pockets,
they'd choose the 4/600 PS. This model, which, like the 5MP,
supports PostScript printing, seemed to strike the right balance
between price and capabilities to satisfy our Mac testers'
needs.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5MP

By:
Sean Fulton

 
B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Text quality: A

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: C

SPECS: Mac laser, 600 x 600 dpi, 6 ppm

GOOD NEWS:

* Great grayscale output

* Fast performance

BAD NEWS:

* Costs more than the Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS

In our testers' eyes, the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 5MP offers
superior speed, enhanced grayscale output and better overall
performance than the Apple LaserWriter 4/600 PS. Nevertheless,
those features were not enough to let them swallow the 5MP's
estimated retail price of $1,000 compared with the Apple printer's
$900 estimated cost. That translated into a grade of C for
the LaserJet 5MP in overall value--and a narrow second-place
finish.

Our testers were a little confused when they didn't see a power
switch, yet the unit failed to wake up when they hooked it
to a Mac. The problem? They simply missed the on/off switch,
which is contoured into the side of the unit and difficult
to find.

Testers liked the text quality of both the 5MP and the 4/600
PS, with the A grade achieved by the HP unit just a fraction
of a point ahead of the A earned by the Apple device. But the
group seemed most impressed with the 5MP's ability to reproduce
high-quality images such as photographs; its B grade in the
grayscale category easily outstripped the Apple unit's B-

The 5MP also includes such flashy features as an infrared port
for wireless printing. While certain Mac users surely will
welcome such extras, eliminating a few of them to knock a few
more dollars off the price might well have saved the day for
this printer with our more value-conscious testers.

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Okidata OkiJet 2010

By:
Sean Fulton

B+

HIGHEST GRADE: Color/grayscale quality: A-

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B

SPECS: PC color ink jet, 600 x 300 dpi, 3 ppm (B&W), 0.5 ppm
(color)

GOOD NEWS:

* High-quality output

* Attractive price

BAD NEWS:

* It's noisy

When you're hot, you're hot--and Okidata was definitely sizzling
in our lab. Not only did its OL-810e LED printer take second
place in the PC laser category, but the first color ink jet
model the company has ever produced, the OkiJet 2010, beat
all comers in the PC color ink jet category. Testers lavished
praise on this model, giving it top marks in almost every area
we asked them to score.

When it came to performance, the unit earned a B, good enough
for a first-place tie with the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 660C.
But even if it had taken twice as long to generate printouts,
our testers said the output would have been worth the wait.

"I was very surprised when I saw the color quality," said Alan
Gleicher. The unit scored an A- for the quality of both its
color/grayscale and graphics output; text quality was only
slightly lower, at a B+. Testers were particularly pleased
that they could get crisp black output and vibrant colors without
losing too much green: The unit retails for less than $400.

Equally pleasing, "the OkiJet's software installation was easiest
of them all," said Bill Anthony; our testers awarded it the
best grade in that category (B+). The one quibble was noise
control, where this model came in third.

In addition to superior output, our testers liked the OkiJet's
solid feel; they all said it seemed built to last. They also
liked the 150-sheet feeder; rivals handle only 100 sheets.
But don't think the unit's strengths are just on paper--the
winning OkiJet 2010 won reams of real-world praise.

HIGHEST GRADE: Text quality, graphics quality: B+

LOWEST GRADE: Ease of installation: B

SPECS: PC color ink jet, 600 x 600 dpi (B&W), 600 x 300 dpi
(color), 4 ppm (B&W), 0.6 ppm (color)

GOOD NEWS:

* High-quality output

* Excellent documentation

BAD NEWS:

* Mangles envelopes

Only the OkiJet 2010 earned a better overall grade than the
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 660C among the PC color ink jet printers.
And the DeskJet model actually took top honors for its documentation
and performance (both B's, the latter a tie with the OkiJet
2010)

Testers raved about the instruction manual, which was chock
full of illustrated guides. "HP had the best documentation,"
declared Ellen McLaughlin. "I consider myself a novice, and
this was good for me."

Testers praised the model's dexterity; it churned out high-quality
output for both color and monochrome print jobs, and received
straight B+'s in all text, graphics and color/grayscale categories,
finishing second only to the OkiJet 2010. Like its Mac counterpart,
the DeskJet 660C uses HP's ColorSmart technology, a system
that adjusts the color balance on printouts to ensure it looks
as sharp as can be.

Our testers did cite a couple of drawbacks, though. For instance,
they awarded the DeskJet 660C the lowest grade for noise control
among the color ink jets (B); the printer lets out a mechanical
"whirring" sound each time a piece of paper travels through
its print mechanism. It also had problems printing envelopes;
some testers grumbled that the envelopes came out wrinkled
or smudged.

Despite these complaints, the DeskJet 660C (which is sold for
Macs as the DeskWriter 660C) proved to be a high flyer.

B

HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control: B+

LOWEST GRADE: Graphics quality: C+

SPECS: PC color ink jet, 360 x 360 dpi, 4 ppm (B&W), 0.8 ppm
(color)

GOOD NEWS

* Attractive design

* Large buttons for easy use

BAD NEWS

* Printouts have a faded look

Canon includes a variety of home-oriented software--from the
Crayola Art program for kids, to Pattern Maker, a cross-stitch
application that prints colored stitching patterns onto fabric
-with the BJC-4100, which is nice. But this didn't cause our
testers to look past color and black-and-white print quality
they considered merely adequate in awarding the unit an overall
grade of B. They perceived its output to be a bit faded compared
with that of other printers--it could muster only a B- for
color quality, a C+ for graphics quality, and a somewhat better
B for text printouts.

While the BJC-4100 didn't earn unqualified praise, its attractive
styling, reasonable price and ease of use made testers take
notice. The device sports an elegantly sleek design that testers
said they would eagerly welcome into their homes. The group
also liked the fact that all the buttons and switches on the
unit were large and easily accessible. Like most of the other
color ink jets, the BJC-4100 has a 100-sheet paper tray and
can hold 15 envelopes at a time.

Even with its relatively low ranking, the BJC-4100 received
consistent B and B+ grades in most categories. The printer
even finished best among the color ink jets for noise control
(B+), which could be crucial for home use. "I'm considering
buying it," said Steven Russell. "The text quality is good,
and I like the quiet."

Consumer Lab--You Rate The Products: Epson Stylus Color IIs

Sean Fulton

 
C

HIGHEST GRADE: Noise control: B

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: D

SPECS: PC color ink jet, 360 x 360 dpi, 4 ppm (B&W), 1 ppm (color)

GOOD NEWS:

* Low price

BAD NEWS:

* Printout quality trails the pack

The rating for the Epson Stylus Color IIs boiled down to one
question: Testers asked themselves if they'd sacrifice better
quality output to save roughly $70. The answer: the printer's
overall grade of C.

At about $329 retail, the Stylus Color IIs costs just a little
less than what you'd probably pay for the top-scoring OkiJet
2010, but our testers told us that small savings in price wouldn't
be worth the faded and gray output.

The Stylus Color II finished dead last in almost every category,
garnering some strikingly poor grades for performance (D+),
overall quality (D+) and overall value (D)

Despite repeated calls to technical-support lines from testers
and to Epson's public relations department from HomePC editors,
the testers could get no closer to printing in red than a sharp
magenta. Images were often blurry, and black print generally
appeared to be washed out. About the best Bill Anthony could
say was that "the text quality was readable--not crisp or clear,
but at least it printed."

While other ink jet printers our testers examined were slower,
the Epson model still wasn't fast enough to outrun complaints
about its print quality. "I would change everything about the
Epson, make it faster and even cheaper," said Thomas DeRosa.
"For the time it took to print, the printout should have been
of 'Kodak moment' quality."

In a field of otherwise solid PC color ink jets, our testers
felt you could certainly do better.

HIGHEST GRADE: Ease of installation: A

LOWEST GRADE: Color/grayscale quality, overall value: B-

SPECS: Mac color ink jet, 720 x 360 dpi (B&W), 360 x 360 dpi
(color), 5 ppm (B&W), 0.3 ppm (color)

GOOD NEWS:

* Easy to install

* Quiet as a mouse

BAD NEWS:

* Unexceptional print quality

The race between the Macintosh ink jet printers looked a lot
like the showdown between the two Mac laser printers: In both
cases, the Apple model just edged out its rival from Hewlett
Packard.

A quick glance shows a B+ overall grade for the Apple Color
StyleWriter 2400 as opposed to a B for the HP DeskJet 850C,
but as sportscasters say, the game was closer than the final
score indicates.

Testers gave the Color StyleWriter 2400 A's for both ease of
installation and documentation. They also favored the Apple
unit's compact design to the DeskJet's layout, and preferred
the Apple printer's noise control and performance. Finally,
the scales tipped in favor of the Color StyleWriter 2400 on
the question of overall value: It's about $200 less at retail
than the DeskJet 850.

But if you value printout quality more than price, bear in mind
that our testers much preferred the HP unit's output. "The
StyleWriter worked well, but the quality of its printouts isn't
as good as the Hewlett-Packard's," declared Adrienne Klein.

For our testers, the lower price tag, sleek design and ease
of use seemed good enough reasons to recommend the Color StyleWriter,
but they wouldn't ignore the DeskJet 850C, either.

HIGHEST GRADE: Graphics quality, color/grayscale quality: B+

LOWEST GRADE: Overall value: B-

SPECS: Mac color ink jet, 600 x 600 dpi (B&W), 300 x 300 dpi
(color), 6 ppm (B&W), 2 ppm (color)

GOOD NEWS:

* High-quality output

* Vibrant colors

BAD NEWS:

* Big cabinet

* Poor documentation

Even though our testers thought the Apple Color StyleWriter
2400 was the better overall value, they were nearly bowled
over by the printouts the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 850C produced.

The unit racked up impressive B+ grades in all categories concerned
with output quality. "This is what I want in a color printer,"
said Adrienne Klein--"good, professional quality."

Our panel repeatedly used terms like "vibrant" to describe the
color images, and complimented HP's ColorSmart technology,
which adjusts tones among colors to make a page look its best.

Our testers might even have recommended the DeskJet 850C over
the Apple ink jet if not for a design they suspected could
have been a little sturdier, a sometimes bumpy installation
process and documentation that was occasionally a chore to
wade through. "I thought the manual was poorly written," said
Theresa Tocci. "It didn't clarify the driver installation for
me." While the DeskJet 850C's scores in all three areas weren't
bad, they just weren't as good as the Apple model's.

Another drawback was the DeskJet 850C's estimated retail price,
about $200 higher than that of the Color StyleWriter 2400.
But as the saying goes, you get what you pay for--and in this
case, you'll get demonstrably high-quality color printouts.

Nuts + Bolts--Step-By-Step Tips: Filling in Windows 95's installation gaps

By:
Sean Fulton

If you've decided to upgrade to Windows 95, odds are you were
lured by its promise to make your PC perform as well as it
possibly can. But simply installing the new operating system
doesn't ensure maximum returns; to set up your PC to run at
full speed and peak efficiency, you'll need to tinker with
some of Windows 95's default settings.

During installation, Windows 95 makes a series of educated guesses
about your hardware setup. The process is designed to ensure
smooth installation on just about any PC, which means it errs
on the side of caution--often at the expense of system performance.
The 30-minute tune-up described here will adjust your settings
to the ones best suited for your computer.

Another result of Windows 95's cautious approach is that it
seldom replaces your DOS CD-ROM and sound-card drivers during
installation. Picking the correct drivers is tricky; the installation
program sticks with the tried-and-true DOS drivers--which are
not the most efficient--rather than risk installing the wrong
ones for your particular peripherals, which might disable them.
So, in addition to taking the steps outlined here, you should
contact the manufacturers of your PC, CD-ROM drive and sound
card to get faster, 32-bit Windows 95 drivers and upgrade instructions.

Before you begin, be sure...

*Windows 95 is installed on your computer.

*You have documentation handy for your PC, as well as for DOS
and Windows 95; it'll help you determine which drivers are
now installed.

STEP 1: Click on Windows 95's Start button, highlight Settings,
then click on Control Panel. Double-click on the System icon;
this opens a window that contains basic information about your
PC's setup. Click on the Performance tab.

STEP 2: The Performance panel displays information about your
computer's resources, including its memory (note the number;
you'll need it in step 4). Click on the File System button;
this lets you set up the operating system for fast file access.

STEP 3: If you're using a desktop PC, make sure the "Typical
role of this machine" area is set to "Desktop computer." If
you've got a notebook PC, click on the down arrow and choose
"Mobile or docking system." Make sure the slider switch labeled
"Read-ahead optimization" is on Full; this will boost your
computer's performance by setting it to anticipate what data
from your hard drive it will read next. When these settings
are correct, click on the tab marked CD-ROM at the top of the
window.

STEP 4: "Supplemental cache size" specifies how much of your
PC's memory is set aside as a CD-ROM cache. If you've got less
than 8 megabytes of RAM, Microsoft recommends a 64-kilobyte
cache; move the cache slider to the far left, and indicate
"No read-ahead" in the "Optimize access pattern for" area.

If you have 8 to 12 MB of RAM, move the slider to the fifth
indicator point to get a 626-KB cache, and indicate "Double
speed drives." (It's possible to create a larger cache, but
it won't increase your speed.)

If you have more than 12 MB of RAM, indicate your actual CD
ROM drive type, and move the slider to the far right. Click
on OK to return to the System Properties window.

STEP 5: Click on the Graphics button at the bottom of the System
Properties window. A new window appears, which lets you specify
your PC's video-card settings. Drag the "Hardware acceleration"
slider to Full, which tells your computer to run video as fast
as your video card allows. Click on the OK button in this window,
then on the Close button in the main System Properties window.
If you changed any settings, you'll be asked if you want to
restart the PC. Click on Yes.

STEP 6: Open the Control Panel again, as in step 1. This time,
double-click on the Printers icon. Click once on your printer,
then click on File and select Properties from the pull-down
menu. Click once on the tab marked Details, then on the Spool
Settings button.

STEP 7: If it isn't active already, turn on the option labeled
"Spool print jobs..."; this means you can get back to work
quickly when you print, rather than tie up your system until
the entire document prints out. Unless you're short of hard
drive space, choose the option labeled "Start printing after
last page is spooled," which gets you back to your other programs
faster after a print command. If you choose "Start printing
after first page is spooled," as shown here, you'll use less
drive space, but you'll sacrifice some system speed. Save your
settings by clicking on OK.

STEP 8: Go back to the Windows 95 Start menu, select Programs,
then Accessories, and choose the WordPad text-editing program
from the bottom of the list. Select Open from the pull-down
File menu and look at the config.sys file's contents, which
includes your DOS device drivers. Locate the drivers with functions
that are duplicated in Windows 95, such as the power management
driver power.exe shown above. (If you're not sure what's what,
check your PC, DOS or Windows 95 documentation, or call Microsoft
at 206-635-7000.)

STEP 9: Instruct Windows 95 to ignore references to unnecessary
DOS drivers by typing REM at the beginning of the lines for
those drivers; this tells the operating system to treat the
line as a "remark," not an instruction--in other words, to
ignore it. If you have new, 32-bit CD-ROM drivers from your
PC or CD-ROM drive manufacturer, you can do the same with the
lines for DOS CD-ROM drivers, such as aspi2dos.sys and aspicd.sys,
which are shown in the screen for step 8. When you've finished
editing this file, choose Save from the pull-down File menu.

STEP 10: Now, open your PC's autoexec.bat file using WordPad.
Once again, you'll be looking for DOS drivers you can remove
because they've been replaced by 32-bit Windows 95 drivers.
You'll also want to remove the DOS smartdrv.exe utility; Windows
95 doesn't need it. Once you're done, choose Save from the
pull-down File menu, then close the WordPad program by selecting
Exit from the same menu.

STEP 11: Click on the Start button and choose Shut Down from
the menu. When the Shut Down window appears, select the "Restart
the computer" option, then click on Yes. When it restarts,
your Windows 95 PC will be cruising at optimum speed.

Financial Adviser--Taking Care Of Household Business: 
On-line sources pay dividends for investment clubs

By:
Wayne Harris

Before Douglas Gerlach saw a newspaper clipping about investment
clubs in spring 1993, he had paid no mind to the stock market.
As associate director of institutional giving at New York City's
Lincoln Center, Gerlach's job is to raise money, not invest
it--he had never owned a share of stock in his life. Yet the
clipping intrigued him; the idea of getting together on a regular
basis with other people to learn about investing and build
a strong financial portfolio sounded like one worth exploring.

Gerlach mailed away a request for more information to the National
Association of Investors Corp. (NAIC), a not-for-profit organization
for investment clubs mentioned in the article. While waiting
for the packet to arrive, Gerlach decided to bone up a little
on his own.

"I had been subscribing to CompuServe for years, mainly for
entertainment," Gerlach says. "But I figured there must be
some investing information there." Sure enough, he found NAIC
on-line, with much of the information he had just mailed away
for available to download to his PC on the spot. He received
stock-selection tutorials, demonstration versions of stock
screening software (which helps pinpoint stocks to buy based
on the criteria most important to you, such as a company's
annual dividends or earnings data), and sample partnership
agreements for investment club members. He began posting questions
on the forum's message board, and investment club veterans
quickly chimed in with advice.

Armed with the information he'd gathered on-line, Gerlach and
14 friends formed the Blue Chip Posse investment club, with
Gerlach as president. At monthly meetings, members contribute
between $20 and $100 to be invested in new stocks as a group;
they also reinvest the dividends they earn from some companies
in more stock, or apply those dividends to cash reserves for
future investment. Starting from scratch, the Posse has nurtured
a portfolio worth $15,000 in 18 months.

There are nearly 17,000 investment clubs in the United States
today, giving people who couldn't ordinarily afford to play
the stock market alone a chance to get involved; by pooling
cash, club members can more easily meet the costs of trades
and commissions. The clubs also provide an excellent way for
curious newcomers to learn the ropes.

Commercial on-line services and the Internet are proving to
be invaluable assets for investment clubs, delivering everything
from tips on forming a club to resources for buying stocks
at rock-bottom commissions. You don't even have to be in an
investment club to make use of much of this information--if
you'd rather invest on your own, you'll still be able to use
many of these on-line services for, say, screening stocks or
researching companies.

Investment clubs accumulate wealth through long-term investing.
The average club begins to outperform the market only after
about eight years; every dollar a club invests generally doubles
in about seven years--if it survives that long. Some 40 percent
of new clubs dissolve within two years, and that's a losing
proposition for their members. "The liquidation value of most
clubs is often less than the capital contributions of its members
during the first year or two," Gerlach warns.

PICKING THE RIGHT PARTNERS

Because of the high dropout rate and the risks involved, make
sure the people you link up with for your investment club share
a long-term perspective on investing, and that you feel you
can trust them to do the investment research necessary to make
the club a success.

One way to find prospective members for a new club is to post
a note in CompuServe's NAIC forum (Go NAIC), or in the investment
club folder in America Online's Motley Fool area (Keyword:
Motley). Motley Fool has the best-maintained investment message
boards you'll find in cyberspace. When you post your call for
partners, specify that you're looking for people (usually in
your geographic region) who are committed to long-term investments,
and don't shy away from probing respondents for information
about themselves. People who have a track record of maintaining
commitments to organizations will likely make better members
than lone wolves who claim to know a lot about investing.

Not every investment club holds face-to-face meetings. For instance,
Gerlach--who has become an enthusiastic investor--is also president
of the Pioneer Online Investment Club (POLIC). Members hail
from all over the United States and as far away as Japan. The
club conducts its business electronically, using its own message
boards in the NAIC forum on CompuServe.

To join POLIC, simply participate in the club's discussions
about its portfolio and its hunt for stocks for a couple of
months, then request membership. If you're on America Online
or Prodigy, you can set up your own POLIC-style club using
your service's investment message boards.

Along with its CompuServe site, NAIC maintains a site on the
Internet's World Wide Web (http:// www.better-investing.org)
where visitors can also see investment club advice, sample
club bylaws and model partnership agreements. If you're interested
in launching a club, you can download the documents and amend
them to suit your group's needs.

Be sure that all club members sign copies of a partnership agreement
before any money changes hands. Such agreements are legally
binding structures that allow tax liability on the club portfolio's
dividends and capital gains to be passed along to its members.

Once your club--whether it's an on-line venture or a more traditional
face-to-face association--is up and running, you'll have to
agree on an investment style; the two broadest styles are "growth"
and "value." Growth investors tend to favor companies with
a history of increased earnings year after year; investors
will pay a premium for this seemingly predictable ability to
increase earnings. Value stocks tend to trade for less money
than growth stocks because their earnings are unpredictable;
their fortunes are usually more closely tied to the general
business cycle. A recession, for example, probably won't affect
whether or not people buy breakfast cereal, but it's certainly
likely to dim the fortunes of companies in the auto industry.

To get information on various investment styles as well as background
on the top stocks within those styles, clubs may subscribe
to stock-monitoring services such as Value Line or Standard
& Poor's, consult with a retail broker who subscribes to Value
Line (and pay retail commissions), or leg it down to the public
library to do research.

Investment club members who maintain accounts on America Online,
CompuServe and Prodigy have another option: access to useful,
low-cost electronic resources. For instance, Prodigy's $9.95
monthly fee gives investment club members the opportunity to
use Stock Hunter (Jump: Stock Hunter), which has an excellent
library of articles on eight popular investment styles. Included
are explanations of Dodd/Graham, the granddaddy of value investing
styles, which was developed by two finance professors in the
1930s, and One Up on Wall Street, a growth-oriented style developed
by the legendary Fidelity Magellan fund manager, Peter Lynch.
Download these explanations and your club will be off to a
great start at defining its niche. Stock Hunter also lets you
screen for top stocks in each category and download the listings
for a $1.95 surcharge.

An even deeper array of investment resources--without surcharges
-is available on America Online. Both the Fool's School in
the Motley Fool area, and Investing Basics in the American
Association of Individual Investors area (Keyword: AAII) are
full of articles that will help club members find their bearings.
Consider AAII's common-sense article, "Avoiding Common Investment
Mistakes," required reading. AAII also lets you screen stocks
based on four investing styles, such as companies with low
stock prices relative to earnings. (For more information on
stock screening, see Financial Adviser, February 1995.)

GETTING THE SCOOP

While stock screening can give you an up-to-the-minute snapshot
of a company's earnings history, it won't tell you all you
need to know about its prospects. Are there reasons to think
the company may stumble--or take off--in the future? Does it
face any potentially crippling litigation? Are there any natural
barriers to newer, hungrier competitors entering its market?

All publicly traded companies discuss questions like these in
reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Many of these reports, called 10Qs and 10Ks, are available
for review in the EDGAR archives on the Internet(http://www.sec.gov
edgarhp. htm). About 4,000 companies file electronically today,
but by the end of 1996, all publicly traded companies will
be required to do so. Club members can find these reports on
the Internet or in Disclosure's Edgar Plus section on America
Online (Keyword: Disclosure)

Once AOL members have begun to form a judgment about a company's
prospects, they can click over to First Call (Keyword: First
Call) to see what the pros think. First Call maintains a database
of Wall Street analysts' projections of various company earnings
for the coming years. Meanwhile, Motley Fool's stock message
boards track which companies are generating better- or worse
than-expected quarterly earnings--a big factor in short-term
price swings.

SPEND LESS, MAKE MORE?

Clubs typically invest relatively small sums--$500 to $1,000
-monthly, but full-service brokers and even many well-known
discount brokers charge a minimum $40 commission on each trade;
shop around, or else your new club could wind up paying as
much as 10 percent of its monthly investment in commissions.

Until recently, almost all deep-discount brokers on-line imposed
fairly hefty minimum-balance requirements. But the PC Financial
Network on both Prodigy (Jump: PCFN) and America Online (Keyword
 PCFN) have recently introduced a special deal for investment
clubs. PCFN offers a 40 percent discount in addition to the
normal discount rate, bringing the minimum trade down to a
very competitive $24. There is no minimum-balance requirement.

It's even possible to buy selected stocks with no commissions
and reinvest the cash dividends in still more stock at no charge.
The NAIC forum on CompuServe offers a direct-purchase and dividend
reinvestment option on 138 stocks for $5. The AAII on AOL also
maintains a list of companies that allow direct purchase.

America Online, CompuServe and Prodigy all let you monitor stocks,
track quotes and view cumulative values on a 15-minute delayed
basis; this means that during market hours, the prices you
see reflect the prices your stocks traded at 15 minutes ago,
which isn't a significant time lapse for long-term investors.
But that's about as far as the commercial on-line services
go in terms of portfolio management.

On the Internet, Howe Barnes' Net Investor (http://pawws.com
 How_phtml/top.shtml) will set up specific investment club
accounts that allow members to receive company research and
breaking news, as well as view portfolio values on a 15-minute
delayed basis. Howe Barnes also provides more sophisticated
portfolio accounting than the commercial services offer. For
example, if your club receives a stock dividend and then reinvests
it, you must raise the "cost basis" in the stock or you'll
pay more taxes than you should when you eventually sell it
off. The company will track such items for you, and will even
consolidate the accounting for clubs with more than one portfolio.
Howe Barnes requires a $10,000 minimum deposit to use the service,
and its minimum commission is $35.

NAIC also offers two attractive investment club accounting packages
 Dragonware Investment Club Accountant ($169, or $209 for nonmembers
of NAIC) and NAIC Club Accountant ($159, or $199 for nonmembers),
both for DOS, Windows or Macintosh. These programs supplement
more generic portfolio-accounting services and software programs
by helping you with accounting tasks specific to clubs, such
as tracking the pro rata tax liabilities from capital gains
and losses for members who contribute different amounts monthly.

With so many on-line resources at their disposal, members of
investment clubs--and even individuals--can now get a leg up
on Wall Street, reducing the risk of going broke before you
can get to the broker.

Working At Home--Tools For Getting The Job Done: Perfect pitch: 
How PCs make biz presentations sing

By:
Lynn Ginsburg

Picture this: You're about to address the representatives of
a large corporation who will decide whether they can trust
your home business with their company's travel services contract.
A huge boost to your income rides on your ability to make your
case, not to mention all the good that landing a "name" account
will do for your business's prestige. It's a situation that
would unnerve anyone, but you're cool as can be, because you've
got a secret weapon--a killer computer-based business presentation.
This dealmaker organizes your data, insights and arguments
into a cohesive, entertaining whole, complete with colorful
graphics--and even lively multimedia effects--to deliver your
message loud and clear.

How did you manage to put together such a snazzy production
on a budget? The twist in this plot is that it's the handiwork
of some inexpensive software and a home computer, which make
it possible to express your most creative ideas in a razzle
dazzle display.

Presentation software is tailor-made for people who don't have
the luxury of hiring a graphics designer to create business
presentations. These programs have added many features in recent
years, and they now let you do everything from easily altering
the order in which your data is presented to sending your finished
work to potential clients by e-mail.

Below, we take a look at six of the most popular presentation
programs, which range in price from $99 to about $350. In this
group, you'll find products that are suitable for first-time
users and old hands alike. At one end of the spectrum is ASAP
for Windows, which is very easy to use, but not very flexible.
At the other end is Astound for Windows and the Macintosh-
it lets you add high-quality multimedia effects to your presentation,
but it's more complicated to use.

Other programs--Freelance Graphics 96 for Windows 95, Harvard
Graphics for Windows 95, Novell Presentations for Windows,
and PowerPoint for both Windows 95 and the Mac--fall between
the two extremes. (At press time, Novell was actively looking
for a buyer to take over and support Presentations, among other
products.) These well-known standards offer an array of options
-some of which may confuse the uninitiated--as well as basic
multimedia support for computer-projected screen shows.

We did not look at one popular program, Adobe Persuasion, because
it's due for a major update in early 1996; nor did we review
the very advanced multimedia authoring tools, such as Director
and Authorware, which can be used to create presentations,
but are fairly difficult to master and beyond the needs of
most home business owners.

In trying to decide which presentation package is right for
you, consider the kind of information you must communicate
in your work, as well as the number of PC demos, slide shows
or flip charts you put together each year. For instance, if
you typically make only a couple of presentations a year, you
may be better off with a presentation program that's a cinch
to learn and use than one that's more powerful and takes longer
to master each time.

ASAP: THE OPENING ACTS

If your primary goal is creating a suitable presentation quickly,
and you don't want to customize the design--rearranging elements
on the screen, selecting your own fonts and so on--ASAP is
made to order. Using ASAP, in just 30 minutes I created a presentation
that summed up a client's proposed move to a new site. The
end result was attractive, well organized and professional
looking--the colors were coordinated, the various fonts worked
together, and the spacing and proportions for each slide (which,
when strung together in a screen show or printed for use as
a handout or flip chart, form your presentation) were well
balanced.

ASAP's limited menu choices mean limited confusion. Rather than
trying to choose from numerous options, you simply select from
four main steps for assembling your presentation: writing the
outline, then choosing a slide layout, background and color
scheme.

Using a blank outline, you can create the text for each slide.
To help you figure out what to say, the program offers a few
limited samples of prewritten presentations, including an outline
for a company overview, which you can edit to suit your needs.
ASAP next lets you choose from thumbnail sketches of slide
layout options, such as bulleted lists, two-column spreads
and pyramid charts. What you see is literally what you get
-there's no tinkering with layouts in ASAP.

The choices for your slides' backgrounds, comparable to the
canvas of your presentation, are also presented as thumbnail
picklists--for example, you'll see templates that include a
world map background, which could be a nice backdrop for an
international business pitch, and a muted "Wall Street" template,
a sound choice to impress a conservative client.

If you don't need to sweat intricate design details or special
effects, and you have no desire to negotiate customization
options to jazz things up, you'll like ASAP. Use it to create
workmanlike, effective presentations in a jiffy.

FOUR SEASONED PERFORMERS

Freelance Graphics, Harvard Graphics, PowerPoint and Presentations
all provide a much wider range of options and flexibility than
ASAP, but for the most part each does an excellent job of guiding
you through the main steps at hand. The programs jump in at
the opening screen with wizards, coaches and other helpers
that stay with you as you build your presentation. Unlike ASAP,
however, once these helpers have taken you through the basics,
you can further customize your work, altering the design as
you choose and fiddling with the way data is presented.

Presentations uses easy-to-follow graphics to explain at the
start that each slide in your project will include three layers
 the background, the layout and the slide. You can designate
colors, shapes or clip art as part of the background for every
slide. The layout determines how your titles, subtitles, text
and so on are arranged on a page. Finally, the master slide
contains both layers, and is the overall template that ensures
a consistent design for each slide in your show; you can choose
a master slide design by sorting through an extensive gallery
of thumbnail images.

Like Presentations, the other programs contain many easy- to
use design options, including lots of backgrounds, layout templates
and clip art.

After the basics are in place, all of these programs offer a
slew of customization options. For example, you may want to
make some of your text stand out; in PowerPoint, you could
use the Text Anchor command, which lets you see how your text
looks when placed inside a graphical object--say, inside a
rectangle. Or, in Harvard Graphics, you could size up the options
for a table of data--anything from changing the look of your
column headings to determining exactly how you'd like your
grid lines to appear.

Harvard Graphics and PowerPoint also offer some specialized
design assistance featuring common-sense advice. For example,
Harvard Graphics' CheckDesign measures your slides against
certain design guidelines, pointing out, for instance, that
you've chosen a text size that clashes with your template,
or that you put too many elements on one side of a slide. In
PowerPoint, the AutoClipArt feature compares your text to keywords
in its clip-art database, then presents a list of appropriate
images to use in your slides.

While all these features contribute to a great-looking presentation,
it won't matter much unless you have something compelling to
say. Presentations' Show Expert feature does an especially
good job helping you organize your thoughts logically, and
build to a summary conclusion. I used Show Expert to construct
a presentation for a client that would demonstrate how my marketing
efforts had improved his business, and thus secure more marketing
funds for the future.

With that goal in mind, I contemplated the Show Expert's outline
choices: Did I want to persuade, inform or teach? Definitely
persuade. I was then asked to assess my audience: doubting,
positive, negative or neutral? My client has an open mind,
so I chose neutral. With that click, the program created an
entire outline for me, with slide-by-slide suggestions of how
to build my argument, such as describing the marketing challenges,
the benefits of my solutions and how much revenue my work had
brought in for the client. When the Show Expert was done, I
simply swapped in the facts for my situation and added my own
design elements. Freelance Graphics, Harvard Graphics and PowerPoint
offer comparable outline assistance.

All four of these programs include multimedia options. For example,
they all support basic transition effects--much like the slow
fades, dissolves or wipes you see on TV--that can be used between
any two slides in a computer presentation. You can also add
pre-existing audio, video and animation objects (such as a
line climbing a chart to indicate rising sales) to your presentations.
PowerPoint even lets you build simple animations on your own.

Frankly, it's hard to choose a best-of-breed among these four
for a PC user, although the Windows 95 releases of Freelance
Graphics, PowerPoint and Harvard Graphics are a notch above
Presentations for Windows 3.1 in their automation and multimedia
options. However, a Windows 95 version of Presentations due
to be released soon is expected to even the score on both counts,
while building on the solid ground rules that the current version
uses to get your presentation off the ground. If you already
own an office suite that some of these programs are a part
of--such as Lotus SmartSuite, Microsoft Office or Perfect Office
-you may not need to look any further. At the same time, Harvard
Graphics fans won't be disappointed in this latest version
of the software, either.

ASTOUND: A MULTIMEDIA STAR

If you want to move beyond multimedia basics to introduce some
showmanship, Astound is just the ticket; it strikes a solid
compromise between ease of use and control over program options.

Astound starts with a good selection of predesigned presentations
for a variety of situations, covering topics such as company
profiles and new product introductions.

If you're presenting complicated information in a play to gain
new business or launch a product, you may appreciate Astound's
ability to turn a presentation into an interactive event, allowing
the viewer to click through the data at his or her own pace.
Letting your client take a sort of self-guided tour can increase
the odds that he or she will retain more of the material you
present. You're also more likely to hold that viewer's attention
if you let the person select lively elements that Astound provides,
such as sound, video or animation, as part of your "show."

All of Astound's templates include predesigned animation and
other multimedia elements, which are more sophisticated than
any of the other presentation programs discussed above. Astound's
templates are constructed around multimedia elements; animations,
music and videos are part of the standard design in much the
same way the other programs rely on type styles and clip art
as integral parts of their templates.

With Astound, you can preview an excellent assortment of transition
effects. While high-quality animations are also highlights
in Astound's gallery of predesigned multimedia clips, you can
create your own animated segments, too, making objects move
across a path with detailed, but easily defined, controls.

When you have a combination of animation, transitions and other
multimedia effects in a slide, you can use the program's Timeline
to set one effect to finish before another begins, and control
the order in which the effects appear.

An impressive presentation can go a long way toward vaulting
you ahead of the pack for that all-important business deal.
With your ideas arranged into an informative, convincing and
attractive presentation, odds are you'll be called back for
an encore.

On-line Connections--Exploring The Information Highway: Gray matters: 
the smartest cybersites for seniors

By:
Jeremy Schlosberg

Shortly before Christmas 1994, Barbara Campbell's husband asked
her whether she'd prefer a tennis bracelet or a personal computer
as a holiday gift.

"I'd never had the slightest desire for a computer," Barbara
says. But something prompted her to go for the unknown, and
she chose the PC. After a few classes at a community college
near her Vero Beach, Fla., home, she began exploring America
Online. Before she knew it, she recalls, "I was hooked."

One year later, Barbara, 68, is a regular in a bridge-discussion
group, fires off e-mail to friends and relatives constantly,
and sets up private chat-room sessions with far-flung family
members. "Getting involved with computers is the most exciting
thing I've done in ages," Barbara says.

In fact, she spends so much time on-line that her husband occasionally
regrets having been such an accommodating Santa last year.
"Some days he wishes he had given me the bracelet," Barbara
admits, "but I'm glad he didn't."

Barbara's part of an enthusiastic community of seniors using
computers. According to Odyssey, a San Francisco-based research
firm, one in 10 Americans over age 60 owns a PC; more than
half of those computers are equipped with modems, and about
a quarter of seniors with a PC use an on-line service.

It's no wonder--there's a rich array of experiences on-line
targeted toward older people, be it information on volunteer
opportunities, the latest on the Medicare debate or simply
an opportunity to communicate with others. For instance, Ben
Titow, a 70-year-old widower in Tempe, Ariz., enjoys the chat
rooms. "I'm looking for interesting conversation and friendship,"
he says. "If more comes from it, fine." He doesn't hide his
age when he socializes on-line, but he doesn't make a point
of it, either--Ben's AOL member profile coyly states that he's
of the same vintage as Paul Newman.

"Seniors go on-line for exactly the same reason anyone else
does," says Jim Hursey, 65, a retired production systems manager
in Columbus, Ohio. "It's an interesting hobby, a chance to
meet like-minded people and a convenient source of information."

Of course, seniors have varied interests, which makes all of
cyberspace fair game, but the commercial on-line services-
and America Online in particular--offer lots of senior-specific
activity. The Internet, too, features a growing number of sites
for older people, including one Jim helped found, CyberSenior
Review. (To find some of the top on-line offerings serving
the senior community, see the box below.)

Some of the most comprehensive on-line areas for older people
come from San Francisco-based SeniorNet, a nonprofit group
serving people age 55 and older who are interested in using
computers to "increase their personal knowledge, enhance their
talents and share their wisdom." The organization has 20 Learning
Centers, located on university campuses around the nation,
offering introductory and advanced computer classes to seniors
for free or a nominal charge.

The group's on-line presence includes SeniorNet forums on AOL,
The Microsoft Network and the World Wide Web. "The idea from
the beginning," says SeniorNet founder and president Mary Furlong,
"was to create an electronic community for older people, and
provide them with access to resources and a place to share
their knowledge and ideas."

SeniorNet's Web site (http:// www.seniornet.com/) emphasizes
information and links to other resources; on the commercial
services, its forums stress the companionship many seniors
seek on-line. The AOL version (Keyword: Senior) gets the most
traffic of the SeniorNet areas, so we'll focus on it in the
descriptions below. The Microsoft Network forum, like the fledgling
on-line service, is less than six months old (look for the
SeniorNet listing in the People to People section)

The SeniorNet message boards on AOL cover a broad range of topics.
Arts & Leisure is the most popular destination; discussion
threads focus on some of seniors' favorite activities, including
music, film, literature, hobbies, politics, education and philosophy.

You'll also find plenty of postings (more than 5,000 as of a
recent visit) in SeniorNet's Generation to Generation message
board on AOL, which encourages communication between the young
and old in cyberspace. For instance, the Grandparents & Storytelling
folder recently featured discussion of a clever idea: seniors
using tape recorders to share stories--true tales, original
fiction, readings of cherished classics--with the younger set.

Other hot spots include the Community Center live chat area,
and Showcase & Exchange, a shared library of files created
by SeniorNet members, including everything from holiday recipes
and tips for holding a garage sale to lists of congressional
e-mail addresses and any number of other pet projects.

Given SeniorNet's focus on technology, it's only logical that
SeniorNet Online provides terrific information for "newbies"
 The Getting Into Computers message board is always busy, and
the Computer Tools library in the Showcase & Exchange area
is brimming with sounds, clip art and utilities for visitors
to download.

But if many older surfers make SeniorNet Online their first
stop for basic computer tips, most keep coming back even after
they've acquired some expertise.

"People go on-line for information, but they stay on-line for
the relationships they form," says SeniorNet's Furlong, who
is the co-author, with Steve Lipson, of Young@Heart: Computing
for Seniors (Osborne/McGraw-Hill)

Furlong knows of six couples who got married after meeting on
SeniorNet. The virtual community on SeniorNet has come together
in other ways as well. For instance, Furlong recalls that all
Los Angeles-area SeniorNet members were accounted for within
24 hours of 1994's major earthquake. And one local woman, moved
by the dangerous rescue work undertaken by visiting Marines
after the quake, got the names and home phone numbers of the
military personnel working in the area, used SeniorNet Online
to contact members who lived near the Marines' relatives, and
asked them to call the Marines' families and reassure them
about their loved ones' safety.

The American Association of Retired Persons sponsors areas on
AOL (Keyword: AARP) and Prodigy (Jump: AARP). AARP Online,
as it's known on both services, contains a tremendous amount
of information on issues crucial for the senior community.
The content on the two AARP offerings is similar, but the AOL
forum is easier to navigate.

Both AARP areas include libraries with information about the
organization, as well as articles and AARP position papers
on topics such as senior-related legislation, the emotional
side of aging and the logistics of living on a fixed income.
The information is thoroughly researched, well written and
comprehensive. If you need answers to any question pertaining
to life as an older person in the United States, you'll probably
find them in AARP Online.

Perhaps because the AARP is so well known--and its activism
regarding government programs such as Social Security and Medicare
has stirred some controversy in recent years--AARP Online's
message boards tend to attract a larger number of younger participants
than SeniorNet does. As a result, more heated debates ensue,
particularly in the Entitlements folders. But there's still
plenty of camaraderie here, especially in the folders labeled
Join In/Introduce Yourself and In Search Of; in the latter,
seniors can try to locate former classmates, army buddies,
and other friends with whom they've lost touch over the years.

Like other successful cybervenues, the most popular on-line
forums for older people reflect a genuine sense of community.
Many seniors--especially those putting down roots in retirement
homes or communities--seem to treasure the new link they gain
through cyberspace to family, friends, and people located all
around the world whom they're meeting for the first time. The
Baltimore-based Senior Campus Living network provides one particularly
innovative example. The project, which currently includes three
Maryland retirement complexes (with more planned for other
U.S. cities in the next few years), offers residents computer
training and access to the Internet from a central facility.

Margaret Williams, 77, lives in the Charlestown Retirement Community
in Cantonville, Md., one of the first centers in the Senior
Campus network. She was extremely wary when she signed up for
her first computer training session, nervously telling her
instructor, "I'm not sure what I'm getting myself into here."
But by the end of her session, she marched over and gave him
a "high-five." "I can't wait to tell my son that I surfed the
Net!" she announced triumphantly.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Try a juicy murder case 
(but weigh the depth penalty)

By:
Julie Cohen

In the 1st Degree

Interactive courtroom drama

3 stars

Give Broderbund Software points for impeccable timing: In The
1st Degree, the compelling murder-trial saga that's the company's
first interactive release since it unleashed Myst, hit store
shelves just as O.J. climbed back into his Bronco and rode
off into the Brentwood sunset. For viewers suffering withdrawal
from their daily courtroom fix, the game offers a fine substitute
-even if, these days, it's hard for fictional trials to compete
for drama with real life.

In this torrid tale, prominent art agent Zachary Barnes has
been shot dead; his business partner, artist James Tobin, has
been charged with the murder. You play as the San Francisco
prosecutor assigned to the case; you've got just a handful
of witnesses, and their stories don't all match. Ruby Garcia,
Tobin's live-in girlfriend, recently had a brief affair with
Barnes; Tobin could have killed Barnes because he was jealous.
But then there's the recent theft at the Tobin Gallery to consider;
both Tobin and Barnes stood to reap a substantial insurance
payoff. Could that figure in the case? Barnes' wife alleges
that Tobin masterminded the robbery, with his personal assistant,
Simon Lee, doing the dirty work.

It's your job to sift through everything Garcia, Lee and Mrs.
Barnes say, then present a case to the jury. But after the
courtroom battles of 1995, it doesn't take a legal eagle to
know that jury decisions are unpredictable, so you must plan
your courtroom strategy carefully. Do you argue a motive of
sexual jealousy, art theft cover-up or both? Tobin's defense
attorney is sharp; she'll jump on every weak statement or piece
of misplaced evidence. You have to play your witnesses just
right, ensuring they reveal only the information you need,
and do it as artfully as possible.

Our verdict? A thumbs-up--with extenuating circumstances. The
game's innovative use of video makes for splendid graphics,
but there's not enough gameplay to keep you glued to your screen.
It takes just a couple of hours to interview all the witnesses
and bring the case to trial the first time. If you play again
(if, say, the jury votes to acquit, or Tobin's attorney gets
all charges dropped), you can call the witnesses in a different
order, or take a slightly different tack when you question
them. But while you may uncover new evidence, by and large
you'll be working with the same basic material each time you
play.

Nevertheless, even inexperienced gamers will be able to uncover
-and enjoy--In the 1st Degree's secrets. The story is timely
and challenging, and it may give you a new appreciation of
our legal system--or at least something to do when you're not
watching Court TV.

$50 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Broderbund Software,
(800) 521-6263, (415) 382-4600.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Rubrics' cube

By:
Julie Cohen

 
Endorfun

Puzzle

3 stars

Expect the best. Endorfun is at once enchanting, uplifting,
frustrating and addictive. With its barrage of positive "subliminal"
messages, this New Age puzzle game will raise your spirits
as you maneuver its colored cube across an ever-changing board.

I am at peace. Or at least you start out that way; learning
the basics takes only a few minutes. Simply move your cursor
with the keyboard or mouse to roll a colored cube on a grid
so that it lands face up on a square of the same color. Each
time you make a match, a colored square elsewhere on the grid
lights up, and you must repeat the task.

I can do anything. But it's not as easy as it sounds. You can
learn how to roll the cube in a particular pattern to change
its color to suit your needs, but other colored squares pop
up to block your path, so you have to work fast and master
a variety of cube movements.

Abundance is my true state of being. With 42 games containing
at least seven levels each, Endorfun offers an almost unending
array of challenges within three types of gameplay: In Longevity,
you must keep your cube moving as long as possible without
getting trapped by colored squares on the grid; in Quickening,
a timed game, you must complete levels as quickly as possible;
in Abundance, you get points for every level you complete.
The puzzles and levels get progressively harder as you play.

I am the master of my life. Still, you have no control over
the reward for winning each game: another message of happiness
and love. Some people no doubt will consider these words about
as inspiring as a Stuart Smalley affirmation on Saturday Night
Live. But the least Endorfun can do is offer positive feedback
after coaxing you to spend so many hours under its spell.

$29.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Time Warner
Interactive, (800)482-3766, (818) 295-6500.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: The shape of things to come 
(wave after wave after wave)

By:
Julie Cohen

 
Zoop

Puzzle

2 1/2 stars

Zoop, an addictive puzzle that challenges you to think strategically
and act fast, offers five freaked-out forms ready to fire:
blue boomerangs, green "peanut M&Ms," purple beakers, blue
triangles and red chicken legs.

The playing field is shaped like a plus sign; each branch contains
four columns or rows that slowly fill up with a random assortment
of shapes. A square sits in the center, containing one shape
you use to shoot at the advancing columns or rows. Hit a shape
that matches the one you're firing with, and you eliminate
it from the grid, along with any matching forms that are directly
behind it. Hit a different shape, and your shooter changes
to match the one you just hit. The trick is to eliminate the
longest columns or rows first; if the shapes reach the center
square, the game ends with a bang.

Take one look at Zoop's dynamic design and it'll come as no
surprise to learn that the game was developed by Viacom New
Media, a division of the company that owns MTV. But just like
many music videos, the fun wears thin a little too soon. The
most significant difference between levels is their background;
even with occasional bonus forms appearing, each of the 99
rounds feels remarkably similar to all the ones before it.

Yet Zoop has one advantage that makes it stand out from the
crowd: It uses less than 3 megabytes of hard-drive space, ships
on two floppy disks and runs under Windows 3.1. (Oddly, it's
really a DOS game that happens to run under Windows--as opposed
to most Windows games, which can't run under DOS. If you want
to play it within DOS, just type the command gload at the C
\ prompt.) Now that's one radical retro feature we really dig.

$29.99 (Windows 3.1) from Viacom New Media, (800) 469-2539,
(212) 258-6000.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Do the shag

By:
Julie Cohen

 
Magic Carpet 2

Action-adventure

3 1/2 stars

Flying a magic carpet takes practice, but you won't find any
virtual transportation more fun. This action-packed three-dimensional
sequel (see Fun and Games, April 1995) sends you sailing over
the Netherworlds, where you use your mouse and keyboard to
cast spells of possession and destruction that help you capture
the mana (energy) of your enemies. With its fast action, maniacal
monsters and rich new worlds to explore, Magic Carpet 2 offers
serious gamers a rollicking ride.

The game picks up where its predecessor left off, with 25 new
worlds. But this installment features improved written instructions
and an optional tutorial mode, which lists your objectives
on the screen as you play.

If you've taken this ride before, you'll recognize the giant
bees, mana worms and dragons threatening your hide. But new
enemies abound. Six-headed hydras must die six times before
they'll give up their mana, and leviathans lurk beneath the
water, undetected by the navigational map on your screen. You'll
have to defeat the Seven Servants of Vissuluth--sorcerers and
demons who watch over their master's kingdom--and then contend
with Vissuluth, the Dark Lord himself.

You can destroy your enemies by acquiring meteors, lightning,
earthquakes and volcanoes, but fireballs are always at your
disposal, hurtling across the screen and erupting with a flash.
To protect yourself, you'll also find spells for invisibility,
healing, shielding and more--25 helping hands in all, each
with three levels of intensity. With its impressive twists
and turns, it's a safe bet you'll find Magic Carpet 2 more
than a rug-of-the-mill sequel.

$54.95 (DOS CD-ROM) from Electronic Arts, (800) 245-4525, (415)
571-7171.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Pick the prettier shade of 
green: ecological harmony--or money

By:
Julie Cohen

 
SimIsle

Simulation

3 stars

Island ecosystems rely on a delicate balance for survival. In
SimIsle, you can succeed by working with that balance, or destroying
it.

The program lets you choose one of 25 islands, each with its
own mission: Create a tourist haven that maintains a low pollution
rate but brings high incomes to the locals, for instance, or
build up a lumber-exportation business. If you choose the island
that looks suspiciously like North America, your mission will
be to make gobs of money regardless of world opinion, pollution
or the happiness of the island's native people.

You have 24 agents in your employ; send them to the villages
to create a work force, or to the mines and logging sites to
harness each island's resources. But you'll have to tackle
several tasks at once: For example, building a wildlife preserve
requires having a fenced-in area, but who's going to put up
the fence? That requires unskilled labor--so you must fill
your labor pool before you can move ahead toward your larger
goal.

Despite its politically correct setting, the game maintains
a balanced range of choices. There are no morality plays here;
it's just as easy to do well by exploiting all the available
resources for your personal gain as it is to preserve your
island's beauty while reaping benefits for the common good.
It's your conscience, and your call.

Whatever course you decide to take, you'll need plenty of patience
and planning. As is the case with the many varieties in Maxis's
ever-popular Sim series, a tutorial walks you through one scenario,
then leaves you on your own to figure out the rest. The 100
page manual contains all the data you need; as in real life,
however, it's up to you to decide how best to use it.

$34.95 (DOS CD-ROM) from Maxis, (800) 366-2947, (510) 254-9700.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Not quite full tilt

By:
Julie Cohen

Ultra 3-D Pinball

Arcade

2 1/2 stars

Ultra 3-D Pinball gives you two missions: Rack up as many points
as you can, and advance through three levels to build a starship
and win the game.

Each table--Colony, Mine and Command Post--presents five targets
that you can hit to pile up the points. Timing is everything;
once you start a bonus sequence, you may have only 30 seconds
to hit the next target.

As you meet your pinball challenges, you can work toward your
ultimate goal: building the starship. When you've done all
you can at a given table, you select your bonus: an extra ball,
a Continue (like winning a free game at the arcade), a new
table or a piece of the starship. The tricky part is figuring
out which bonus will bring you closer to the finale. If, for
example, you choose a Continue, you'll get to play a new game
when you're done with the last game in the program. True, you'll
start over with no points, but you get to keep all the pieces
of the starship you're already building. Alternatively, if
you've earned a few Continues, an extra ball might help you
at the table you're playing.

Besides the smooth 3-D action, the game gives you exploding
bulldozers, a unique flying missile glider that carries your
ball to a convenient point on the flippers, multi-ball play
and three sets of flippers per table. And yet, for all its
features, the program lacks flash. You'd need a 45-inch screen
to feel the full effect of the excellent graphics, and scores
are inflated to the point of meaninglessness. I hit 150 million
after keeping one ball alive for about 10 minutes, without
coming close to winning the game.

Ultra 3-D Pinball may save novices a few quarters for the laundry,
but pinball wizards should still visit the arcades if they
want to get their money's worth.

$49.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM) from Sierra On-Line, (800) 757-7707,
(206) 649-9800.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Fists of steal

By:
Julie Cohen

 
Supreme Warrior

Martial arts combat

2 1/2 stars

Supreme Warrior is a single-minded hand-to-hand combat game
in which your only goal is to defeat 12 martial arts masters.
Playing under the watchful eye of your mentor, Master Kai,
you'll face the Earth, Fire and Wind warlords and a total of
six bodyguards, then meet the supreme force of evil, Fang Tu,
with his two nasty bodyguards in tow.

The poor quality of the full-screen video sometimes makes it
tough to see what's happening on screen, but if you're an action
fan, Supreme Warrior still packs a mean punch. Each opponent
has a distinct fighting style; you have to execute your moves
with precision if you're going to make the contact count.

Keyboard manipulation is fairly straightforward if you use the
numerical keypad to throw punches, kick and block. A learning
mode helps you choose the right moves; once you master all
the basics, you can work on combinations that help you steal
powers from your adversaries. There are nine special moves
in all, with colorful, mystical names such as Jade Turtle of
Longevity (which boosts your endurance level), Plum Blossom
Rejuvenation Tea (which recharges your health and attack "chi,"
or energy) and Iron Lotus Shield (which grants temporary invulnerability)

True to its roots, Supreme Warrior can be played in Cantonese.
But don't worry about missing too much dialogue if you try
to play it that way; like the rest of the game, it seems to
be there strictly for kicks.

$59.95 (DOS CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Digital Pictures,
(800) 332-0032, (415) 345-5300.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Lock 'em up 
(just don't throw away the keyboard)

By:
Julie Cohen

 
Fade To Black

Action-adventure

2 stars

What do you do after 50 years of cryogenic sleep? If you wake
up in a cell in the lunar prison colony called New Alcatraz,
you try to escape. That means enlisting the help of dissident
John O'Connors, making your way to the moonbase O'Connors'
rebel affiliates occupy, and running covert missions to defeat
the mighty Morphs--the alien race that now rules the solar
system.

Fade To Black is a standard action-adventure game that sends
you racing through the mazelike corridors of New Alcatraz to
kill any creatures that block your path. Along the way, you'll
acquire various essential objects and tools. Look in every
locker you can--you'll find a variety of ammo and amenities
to help you overcome the Morphs. Bouncing mines ricochet off
the walls to find targets, while bullets can accomplish anything
from piercing armor to determining where the enemy is.

Fade To Black's polygon-rendered graphics have a blocky quality
that many game developers accept as the trade-off for quick,
smooth gameplay. Less forgivable is the clunky way you control
the action. It takes 30 keys to go with the flow: The four
cursor keys let you run, turn left and right, and duck, but
you'll also have to master keystrokes for large and small steps,
180-degree turns, loading your gun and so forth.

If you liked the similarly staged Alone in the Dark 3 (see Fun
and Games, July 1995), you might come back to Black; if not,
you'll probably just let it fade away.

$59.95 (DOS CD-ROM) from Electronic Arts, (800) 245-4525, (415)
571-7171.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Developers who 
can't play the corporate game hit the Web

By:
Stuart Gibbel

What do lost cats, acne and Spam have in common? All play a
part in the quirky games budding developers have posted on
the World Wide Web. These games tend to be crude by today's
multimedia standards, but many have a personal charm that commercial
programs often lack. That's because anyone with a little programming
know-how and an Internet connection can post one, ready for
the world to play, without worrying that a sales or marketing
department will think it too oddball to succeed. For instance,
if you're looking for an off-the-wall simulation, try Hairball

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Fast downloads? Look at Network TV

By:
Keith Kirkpatrick

Ever get frustrated that it takes so long to download images
to your PC, when Seinfeld shows up on your TV the instant you
switch on the tube? It may be a moot point before long. A new
technology standard developed by Intel, coupled with Malachi,
an add-in board from En Technology, can link your TV to your
PC for lightning-fast downloads. The system lets a broadcast
or cable station send digital data, such as interactive games
and multimedia software, to your television at a rate nearly
200 times that of a 9,600-bps modem. The TV can then transfer
the files via standard RCA cable to your computer.

According to Matt Cookson, an En Technology official, it's up
to TV programmers to decide what content they want to send;
whatever it is, it will be transmitted in tandem with regularly
scheduled TV shows (you can record the files on a standard
VCR to retrieve later). Malachi has been tested in New Hampshire
and Vermont, with users successfully receiving "the whole gamut,
from pictures of TV stars to text files to software packages,"
says Cookson. At press time, no major broadcasters had yet
agreed to deliver content using the system--but if they do,
you may want to make room on your coffee table for your keyboard.

Did you know? According to the SimIsle manual:

* Rain forests cover 2 percent of the earth's surface, but house
more than half of Earth's plant and animal species.

* Two hectare (2.4 acres) of rain forest are destroyed every
second.

* An estimated 137 species are driven into extinction every
day--a total of 50,000 each year.

Fun And Games--Great Escapes For Grown-Ups: Flipping out on Ultra 
3-D Pinball? Take six points on us

By:
Julie Cohen

Ultra 3-D Pinball demands sure aim and solid strategy to rack
up big points. Here are six tips you can bank on.

* Timing is everything. If you hit the flipper too early, the
ball will bounce right back to where it was before. Flipping
too late sends the shot into the opposite bumper. To time your
shot perfectly, fire just as the ball meets the flipper.

* Take advantage of the channel. When the ball rolls down the
channel alongside the flipper, raise the flipper to trap it.
Once the ball comes to a stop at the "elbow," you can figure
out your best shot, then lower the flipper to aim the ball
and set it in motion.

* Play the angles. Once you've caught the ball, wait until it
rolls down to the perfect spot on the flipper before you fire.
Flip while the ball is near the top, and it will move vertically,
toward the back of the table. The farther down on the flipper
the ball goes, the more the ball will veer to the opposite
side of the table when fired.

* Throw a left, then a right. This rescue technique can get
you out of a jam. If it looks like the ball is rolling right
down the middle of the table, try to get a piece of it with
one flipper at a time. The key to this maneuver is to make
sure you don't raise both simultaneously. In order to work,
it's got to be a one-two punch.

* Go for a pass. This one's tricky. The object is to flip the
ball from one flipper to the other, in order to get a better
aim at your target. It can be extremely helpful, but to use
this technique consistently well, your best bet is to practice,
practice, practice.

* Throw your weight around. Don't be afraid to "shake the table"
if the ball looks like it's headed for one of the lanes that
will take it out of play. After all, you can't flip the ball
if you can't get to it. A tap or two on the space bar should
do the trick; more than that, and you're flirting with a tilt.
--J.C.

Lifestyles + Learning--The PC Way: Where science and conscience collide

By:
Charles Bowen

The Day After Trinity

History, science

4 stars

The Trinity Site in New Mexico is the innocent-sounding name
of the spot where the first atomic bomb was tested in 1945.
The Day After Trinity, a finely focused, beautifully crafted
CD-ROM version of Jon Else's 1980 Oscar-nominated documentary
film of the same name, tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer
-the brilliant, fretful scientist who spearheaded the project
that unleashed the most terrifying, destructive weapon the
world had ever seen.

The story of "The Bomb" begins with the youthful exuberance
of America's wartime scientific community; it ends much more
soberly, as the bomb's developers mourn the horror and destruction
their work caused in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and come to terms
with its legacy--the Cold War and the nuclear arms race.

The disc incorporates the complete 88-minute film in QuickTime
video format, but that's only the beginning. The CD-ROM also
provides a vast collection of supporting material sure to impress
history and film buffs alike. You can hear real-time audio
commentary about the film from director Else, documentary scholar
Michael Renov and cultural critic B. Ruby Rich; and you can
pause at any point in the film to examine relevant documents
from a dossier of declassified files. You'll see papers from
the Manhattan Project, which created the bomb, as well as related
documents and letters from the FBI files.

A gallery of 100 black-and-white photos includes rare scenes
from Los Alamos, the New Mexico town where the nuclear scientists
lived and worked during the bomb's development. The program
includes biographical sketches of each person who appears in
the documentary or is even mentioned within the production.

Voyager, the disc's producer, is rapidly becoming multimedia's
class act, producing high-quality, affordable, socially relevant
discs time and again. The Day After Trinity is another feather
in the company's cap. Voyager has refreshingly resisted the
temptation to simply reproduce another medium's work, choosing
instead to build on it--and make it seem altogether better
and brand-new.

$29.95 (Windows CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Voyager, (800)
446-2001, (914) 591-5500.

Lifestyles + Learning--The PC Way: Bellying up to the toolbar

By:
Charles Bowen

Mr. Boston Official Bartender's and Party Guide

Entertaining

3 stars

Just in time for New Year's Eve, bartending's premier "little
red book"--the Mr. Boston Official Bartender's and Party Guide
-sets up its toolbar for service on the PC screen.

Mr. Boston pours more than 1,200 mixed-drink recipes onto two
Windows floppy disks. You'll find the potions in an index searchable
by name or ingredient, mixed in with introductory material,
advice on party preparation and tips on how to keep a well
stocked bar. Do you know how to properly chill or frost a glass?
When to stir and when to shake? How to open champagne or sparkling
wine? The answers are all here at your fingertips. When the
bar's dry, you can also pick up details on party tricks and
games, including the Bottoms Up Money Trick, the X-Ray Eyes
Coin Trick, the Lift a Bottle with a Straw trick, the Three
Glass Trick and the Iron Fist trick. In perhaps the neatest
trick of all, the disks install directly on your hard drive
and take up less than 6 megabytes of storage space.

The program is one of the first in a series of 36 electronic
books Time Warner is releasing on floppies in its new "Quick
Reads" series. Each will use the same simple interface, which
lets you find material by keyword, view illustrations, browse
chapters, and copy, print and mark information for future reference.
Upcoming disks will cover topics in business, cooking, self
help and entertainment; if they maintain Mr. Boston's quality,
you'll be glad there's still a long way to go before last call.

$14.95 (Windows) from Time Warner Quick Reads, (800) 759-0190,
(212) 522-7200.

Lifestyles + Learning--The PC Way: Start spreading the newsletters

By:
Sharlene Johnson

Microsoft Publisher CD Deluxe for Windows 95

Desktop publishing

4 stars

Publisher's easy-to-use PageWizards have long been a boon to
novice desktop publishers. Now, with a few minor additions
here and enhancements there, the updated Publisher CD Deluxe
for Windows 95 makes professional-looking newsletters and other
print projects a snap even for newcomers.

On the revised startup screen, you'll find Publisher's tried
and-true Wizards represented by icons rather than listed in
a text box; this minute change makes them seem more accessible.
The so-called "design assistants" practically do all the work
for you, helping you create anything from funky greeting cards
to formal letterhead to newsletters that get noticed. With
a storehouse of more than 1,000 pieces of clip art, 60 TrueType
fonts and 100 border designs, you may find you don't need to
buy separate art or font collections.

Experienced self-publishers and do-it-yourselfers can--and probably
will--skip the Wizards and start from scratch. Even so, step
by-step help is never hard to find; this version offers the
option of leaving the Help box up on the screen for easy reference
while you work. It also provides Tip pages (pop-up messages
that suggest shortcuts for the function you're using at that
time), Tool Tips (pop-up descriptions that explain each button's
function) and First-Time Help, which offers a quick overview
of a feature the first time you use it.

Given the near-overload of help features, you might think that
the hefty manual--more than 300 pages--would be superfluous;
but it provides a useful introduction to design, with helpful
articles on creating a distinctive layout, selecting the right
paper, using color and choosing appropriate fonts.

Publisher has several other new and enhanced features designed
to polish your work. For example, you can give your newsletter
the look of a first-class magazine with the addition of Fancy
First Letters, a table of contents, a masthead and "Continued
on..." lines that will help your readers find the pieces of
a story spread out over non-consecutive pages. The Outside
Print Setup will ensure that your file is shipshape for delivery
if you plan to use a professional printer.

With this more polished Publisher on your computer, putting
words into print is practically painless.

$79.95 (Windows 95 CD-ROM) from Microsoft, (800) 426-9400, (206)
882-8080.

MOBA: The Virtual Museum of Bad Art

Art

2 1/2 stars

Ever stand in a museum looking at a painting and ask yourself,
"Is that really supposed to be good?" Well, if the museum you're
visiting is MOBA, the answer is "No!"

For four years, Boston's Museum of Bad Art has been celebrating
awful artwork, and now its good humor and bad taste come together
in a fun and funny CD-ROM.

MOBA's disc takes users on a virtual tour of all 28 rooms in
the museum. Where else could you see Elvis as he might have
been drawn by Picasso? Or Lucy in the Field with Flowers, pulled
from a trash heap on a Boston street in 1992?

The pictures are accompanied by comments, anecdotes and put
ons from more than 90 visitors to the real museum: "I've seen
bad art in some of the best museums in the world," reports
Lorraine McGrath, "but this place is full of it."

"MOBA is a bad place to visit, but a great place to meet men,"
says Vicki Gold.

And what did Peter O'Reilly like best? Well, "I'm very impressed
with some of the frames," he comments dryly.

In terms of the MOBA collection, that's as good as it gets.

Lifestyles + Learning--The PC Way: Moving memorials to the unknown soldiers

By:
Charles Bowen

 
Beyond the Wall

History

3 1/2 stars

Too often, war stories are recorded with little emotion or humanity.
Library shelves are filled with dissections of bloody battles
in terms of grand strategy and statistics, biographies of leaders,
and maps of troop movements; the men and women who were living
-and dying--in the trenches are inexplicably missing in action.

Beyond the Wall nobly tries to rectify this situation by preserving
personal stories from the Vietnam War. It's a powerful tribute
to the 58,000 fallen soldiers whose names appear on the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial, in Washington, D.C.

The CD-ROM documentary leads you on a 3-D tour of the famous
black-granite monument. Along the way, you can click on any
of 18 ghostly images to read excerpts from letters and hear
audiotapes sent home by soldiers shortly before they died.
You can also view personal mementos--from combat boots to stuffed
animals--left by grieving family and friends at the wall. Poetry,
music, photos, home movies, letters and diary entries come
together in a compelling collage.

The program also incorporates an extensive, searchable database
of the names on the wall, augmented with information on the
soldiers' hometowns, birth dates and military ranks, as well
as the exact locations where you'll find the names on the monument.

Another section describes how the wall came to be, beginning
with Vietnam veteran Jan Scruggs' inspiration after seeing
the movie The Deer Hunter, continuing through the design competition,
and ending with the construction and dedication in 1982. Along
the way, you'll hear comments from the winning designer, Maya
Lin, as well as surviving political and military leaders reflecting
on the era.

The disc's one serious flaw is its embarrassingly sparse section
called About the War. Rather than teaching us, the section
merely demonstrates that the story of the Vietnam War is too
long and complex to be covered as an after-thought. For that
reason, this is not a very helpful disc for students in search
of the facts, figures and fissures surrounding Vietnam. But
for anyone who wants to understand why the word still stirs
our emotions 20 years after the end of hostilities, it's an
excellent place to start looking for answers.

$39 (Windows CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Magnet Interactive
Studios, (800) 996-0011, (310) 369-2851.

Verse Search 6.0

Religion

3 stars

Bert Brown and Kent Ochel made history 14 years ago when they
put the entire Bible on computer disk for the first time. But
the result hardly seemed a match made in heaven; hard drives
were rare, compact discs unheard of--and searching the massive
text required the patience of Job.

Now, with Verse Search 6.0, mere mortals can tackle the task
with ease. The software will rapidly search the Old and New
Testaments, pull out verses containing specified keywords,
and link with relevant study manuals, maps, a biblical encyclopedia
and personal notes. It took only a second for the program to
locate all 1,515 verses mentioning "children," then narrow
the list to the several dozen that also mention "teaching"
or "training." The software makes it easy to copy material
 A dynamic data-exchange feature lets you use the program's
information in documents within WordPerfect, Word and AmiPro.
It also comes with two Bible translations (the King James version
and the New International translation), a Bible dictionary
and a collection of maps.

For serious students of religion, the publisher produces many
add-on features that can be used with the same search system,
including additional translations, study aids such as Greek
and Hebrew transliterators, and biblical guides. However, this
is not a multimedia program; it's designed for research, not
entertainment, so you'll find no audio, video or overview accompanying
its text and menu bars. But if you're more than a dabbler in
theological topics, Verse Search is a powerful tool that may
be the answer to your prayers.

$149.95 (DOS, Windows 3.1, Macintosh, DOS CD-ROM, Windows 3.1
CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Bible Research Systems, (800)
423-1228, (512) 251-7541.

Home Improvement 1-2-

Do-it-yourself

3 1/2 stars

As any devotee of the popular TV sitcom knows, there are two
kinds of people who attempt home improvement: the bungling
Tim types, who need all the help they can get, and the practiced
pros, like Al, who wield their power tools with poise and panache.
Fortunately, no matter which category you fall into, it's hard
to go wrong with the straightforward techniques in Home Improvement
1-2-3.

Although the disc--based on the book of the same name--is organized
to allow quick access to the numerous step-by-step project
instructions, detailed background information is also readily
available. In addition, buttons access safety alerts, tool
lists, designers' tips and shopping guidelines. The Skill Scale
button helps you decide if you're qualified to tackle a job;
Homer's Hindsight warns of common errors.

Home Improvement 1-2-3 offers built-in calculators and full
motion video--most of which, unfortunately, is limited to brief
chapter introductions. But the best thing about using your
PC as a plumber's helper is that you can print the illustrated
instructions for fixing a leaky faucet, then take them right
to the kitchen sink. After all, not even an expert like Al
would risk getting a nice hardcover book within soaking range.

Compton's Complete Street Guide

Mapping

2 1/2 stars

Take a left at the stoplight, drive a few blocks, then turn
right and hang a quick left at the gas station...." Lost yet?
Following directions is always tricky--you might reach your
destination, but then again, you might not. The custom maps
in Compton's Complete Street Guide aim to ensure you and your
guests never get lost again.

Like several competing street-level mapping programs, Street
Guide offers you a close look at any U.S. neighborhood. Its
strongest innovation is a palette of "stamps"--102 small pictures
you can drag and drop on your map. Use a tiny house to show
the location of your home, for example, then label it with
a brief description (such as "Our house"). You can flag landmarks
with arrows, stoplights, pointing hands and labels such as
"Turn left here." When you're done, print your map (for best
results, use a color printer)

On the downside, Compton's Street Guide lacks the search muscle
of some competitors--for example, the program stops short of
locating specific street addresses. But it'll get you where
you're going, with a fair amount of style.

By:
Steven Korn

Care for a free preview of the Museum of Bad Art? Browsers are
always welcome at MOBA's Internet outpost (http://mirror.wwa.com
mirror/ orgs/moba/moba.htm). If it serves as a sort of crude
awakening to a low-rent aesthetic, the Web holds some sites
for further research.

The Outsider Art section of the WFMU Catalog of Curiosities
(http://wfmu.org/Catalog/ Sects/outside.html) sells two pertinent
books: Thrift-Store Painting, with 96 reproductions of art
bought in second-hand shops, and Black Velvet: The Art We Love
To Hate, which has 43 examples of "America's only parking lot
art form." Perhaps the artists were inspired by Walter Keane,
who found huge success in the 1950s with oil paintings of big
eyed waifs; you'll find an appreciation of this "thrift-store
expressionism," from the book Cult Rapture, at http://www.csn.net
central/feralhouse/keane.html.

And where will we find the unusual art of tomorrow? Keep an
eye on projects like HypArt (pictured above; http://rzsun01.
rrz.uni-hamburg.de/cgi-bin/ HypArt.sh), where anyone can claim
a piece of the virtual canvas and create a part of a communal
"painting." The creators rightly note that anyone can contribute
because "everybody is capable of producing art"--precisely
the spirit that gave us MOBA's gems.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Another coup for kids' 
favorite purple coupe

By:
Carol Ellison

Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo

Ages 3 to 8

Game

4 stars

Putt-Putt--the plucky purple roadster who stars in a winning
series of animated children's computer games--has yet to take
a wrong turn, as far as the tykes who test software in the
HomePC Kids' Lab are concerned.

"I love this game!" cried Thomas, 5, after getting acquainted
with Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, the latest of the cartoon car's
ongoing adventures.

"I love you!" added 6-year-old Brian when he saw Putt-Putt on
the screen. Then he leaned over and kissed the monitor.

This time out, our hero's off to the Cartown Zoo, where a variety
of baby animals have wandered off from their proper surroundings;
the snake and the hippo are trapped in Arcticland, for instance,
while the lion cub is stuck on a rock halfway up a waterfall.
Players must steer Putt-Putt through the zoo to find the missing
animals and the gadgets he needs to rescue them--a shovel to
dig through an avalanche, for example, or lumber to fix a raft.
It's up to the kids to figure out what tool to use in each
rescue mission; along the way, they can stop for a game of
hockey against a polar bear or snack on cotton candy.

In the HomePC Kids' Lab, Putt-Putt's charms never fail to capture
the hearts of players above the age rating on the box (3 to
8). Cara, 10, loved the game as much as her 6-year-old sister,
Laura, did. Cara hoped that her reward for outscoring the bear
at hockey would be something to use to help a baby snake off
the Arctic ice. Laura cheered for her sister and, like a good
New York (if not hockey) fan, chanted "Let's Go Mets! Let's
Go Mets!" when she heard the organ in the arena. Alas, the
hockey game was just for fun.

"I feel so bad," Cara lamented. "I'm here playing hockey with
this bear, and the poor little snake is freezing his burritos
off."

Maybe it's the music or the excellent cartoon graphics. Maybe
it's Putt-Putt's squeaky voice. Maybe it's the sheer fun of
the game. Whatever the reason, Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo, the
fourth installment in the series, gleefully cements the joyful
jalopy's undisputed title as the most popular character ever
to roll into the HomePC Kids' Lab.

$39.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM, Macintosh CD-ROM) from Humongous
Entertainment, (206) 485-1212.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: History repeats itself 
(say, haven't we seen this concept before?)

By:
Carol Ellison

Mission Code: Millennium

Ages 8 to adult

History

2 1/2 stars

Mission Code: Millennium sends kids racing through time in search
of objects stolen from their proper place in history. As employees
of Virtual Travel Inc., children traipse along a time line
and a map of Europe in an effort to return, say, a copy of
Shakespeare's Othello, James Watt's steam engine or Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony to their rightful era and location.

When players visit a particular historical time, on-screen robots
morph into characters decked out in period garb to briefly
introduce them to the cultural, political, religious and artistic
trends of the day. As children explore museums, laboratories,
libraries, theaters and architectural sites in each location,
they identify objects that may point their search in the right
direction. For example, the items might identify composers
and artists who lived in the same country or century as the
object kids are trying to place.

The helpful robots put history in a livelier context than many
other educational games. But the on-screen clues are limited
to factoids; children can easily end up wandering the centuries
for what seems like ages, collecting clues from numerous eras
until they figure out where each of the four objects belongs.
It helps a lot to keep a good encyclopedia handy.

"This game is cool. It's like, so...virtual," observed Alex,
10, as the program whisked him off from the travel agency's
space station to medieval Germany, where he heard a Gregorian
chant in a cathedral.

But by day's end, Alex had lost his enthusiasm for the disc,
saying that after playing it for a while, the game just didn't
measure up to "the high quality of Carmen Sandiego."

Parents will appreciate the game's educational efforts, and
with 120 items to place, the program has the potential for
many hours of play. But kids? Well, let's just say Carmen Sandiego
has better earned her place in history.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Playing attention to 
math and science

By:
Carol Ellison

Snootz Math Trek/Bumptz Science

Carnival

Ages 6 to 10

Math/science

3 stars

Snootz Math Trek and Bumptz Science Carnival, two punchy PC
programs, prove math and science need not be alien concepts
for kids, as extraterrestrials cross basic skills with the
world of Pachinko games, pinball arcades and carnival sideshows.

Snootz presents kids with six math-related activities; for instance,
they'll help two silly Snootians, Flarn and Foozle, string
together sounds to form melodic patterns, or assemble puzzle
pieces to help fix a spaceship. Several of the games can be
played by two kids at once.

"I found it!" Eric, 7, declared after he uncovered the compass
directions he needed to chart a course to locate Flarn on a
busy street map. "I knew I could do it because I'm good at
math in school," he said. "I don't get anything wrong!"

Another alien, Bumptz, hosts the Science Carnival, where kids
find six games that present demonstrations and experiments
in a sideshow environment. In the underwater Bubblearium, for
example, players use clams to squeeze air out of Bumptz and
inflator fish to squeeze it back in, thus controlling his buoyancy
inside a water tank.

Meanwhile, Cara, 10, described another puzzle as "a little like
art, but it's really a science program."

She and our other young experts found numerous discoveries at
this science fair, which proved to be much more than middling
fun.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: All work and noteworthy play

By:
Carol Ellison

 
Big Job

Ages 4 and up

Exploration

4 stars

Toy trucks and tools are perennial favorites of the sandbox
set. In Big Job, there's plenty of dirt to haul, fires to extinguish
and projects to build; it's bursting with fun-filled activities
that show kids some of the science and sensitivities workers
bring to their jobs.

Unlike Kids on Site (see Kid Raves, October 1995), Big Job teaches
kids about their on-screen jobs instead of just having them
playact the roles. Rather than just driving a tractor or connecting
a fire hose, kids get briefings--sung to catchy tunes--about
the challenges that firefighters, farmers and construction
workers face every day.

When kids show up for work, they collect a time card and punch
in at the Big Job Clubhouse, where they select one of the three
occupations. They can view music videos about the job, play
games or sing songs that help teach them about their chosen
profession. Kids can even "drive" to work in a roadway simulation,
taking care not to run off the road or run out of gas.

The disc was a hit with both boys and girls in the lab--but
especially with the boys, who fought fiercely over who got
to play it.

"Fire truck! Wow! There it is! There it is!" cried Michael,
4, as he grabbed the keyboard from Benjamin, also 4, clicked
on the fire truck in the clubhouse and watched the crew douse
the on-screen flames. Grabbing back the mouse, Benjamin turned
to the jukebox and played a music video that showed firemen
in raincoats heading for the hoses. "It's about firemen," he
said, struggling to keep the mouse until the song finished.
"Look. Just look," he insisted.

Michael did--until the song finished. Then he rushed off to
try his hand at farming.

Secrets of Magic with Dikki Ellis

No age rating (best for ages 10 and up)

Entertainment

3 stars

Magic is hot these days; this is the second of four programs
about magic scheduled to be released in time for Christmas.
So we turned to the experts who looked at the first program,
Magic with Jay Alexander (see Kid Raves, December 1995) and
asked for their verdict. After much debate, our panel gave
the nod to Jay Alexander, but agreed Dikki Ellis has plenty
of tricks up his sleeve.

The program, which also comes with a videotape, presents twice
as many video-based tricks as the Alexander disc, as well as
a "magician's room" that introduces various props, an encyclopedia
and information on basic performance techniques (a prop pack
is available for $5). But the wealth of material proved just
a little too much for the amateur magicians in our lab.

"It's good, but the problem is that the tricks are basically
ones you need to be David Copperfield to perform," said Alex,
10. "Jay Alexander explains himself more."

Kids who've tried to perform magic will enjoy the added depth
of this program. But there's one trick even Dikki Ellis couldn't
pull off: getting the videos on the Windows 3.1 disc to work
under Windows 95--they froze frequently. Villa Crespo, which
makes the program, says any Windows 95 users who experience
problems running the software under the new operating system
can exchange the disc for another Villa Crespo program.

$49.95 (Windows 3.1 CD-ROM) from Villa Crespo Software, (800)
521-3963, (708) 433-0500.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Flight game goes over kids' heads

By:
Carol Ellison

 
First Encounter

Ages 6 to adult

Flight game

1 1/2 stars

With its 138-page manual, difficult DOS interface and key commands,
First Encounter is not a game; it's a commitment. Even junior
power users in the Kids' Lab found it daunting. "There's too
much reading," complained Alex, 10. "It's for people with too
much time on their hands."

The game, a flight simulator set in the 33rd century, asks players
to deal with the politics and economics of the day, avoiding
anarchists and enemy forces while buying and selling commodities.
The box says the game's appropriate for 6-year-olds, but we
know 60-year-olds who couldn't handle all that.

The program features fine graphics and masterful moments of
full-motion video; with a more realistic age rating, it might
have fared better. As it was, 10-year-old David's experience
was typical: He tackled the game with relish but soon tired
of rifling through the manual.

Still, he stuck with it longer than Alex, who threw his hands
in the air after about 30 minutes and declared, "I have no
patience for this."

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: King Pong

By:
Carol Ellison

 
Arcade Mania

No age rating (best for ages 8 to adult)

Game

3 1/2 stars

Remember the arcade games Pong, Tank Commander and Space Invaders?
Then Arcade Mania's Neutrino, Lunar Fox and Nova 3 will look
familiar--and better than ever.

In the Pong-like Neutrino, a nuclear facility is melting down
and kids must bat down walls of neutrons to save it. If they
fail, a helmeted man in white says a quick "uh-oh" before a
mushroom cloud erupts on screen.

In Lunar Fox, players shoot phaser-like bolts to squelch a rebellion
of unruly futuristic "neighbors" who maneuver their tanks through
walled mazes. And in Nova 3, it's up to kids to find and shoot
alien invaders at a space station.

You won't find any educational value here; the games are as
mindless and addictive as Tetris--and just as much fun, with
solid sound and exciting graphics.

Stephanie, 9, squared off against Duwan, also 9, at Nova 3,
then they teamed up, with the observer coaching the player
at the controls.

"Oooh...get that guy," Stephanie said, pointing out the invader
on the screen. Duwan did. The two slapped hands and cried,
"We beat it! We beat it!"

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: The dolldrums

By:
Carol Ellison

Fisher-Price Dream Dollhouse

Ages 3 to 7

Exploration/game

2 1/2 stars

For all its charms, the Fisher-Price Dream Dollhouse just couldn't
measure up to the expectations of the little girls in the Kids'
Lab. Clicking on cups and saucers with a mouse simply isn't
as much fun as staging your own tea party.

Laura, 6, was delighted to find clothes in a trunk in the bedroom;
she dressed the on-screen model in an assortment of outfits,
then explored all the rooms and games in the house. But when
she finished, she said her real dollhouse is "funner."

Abbe, 6, also checked out every room, chatting as she went.

"I'll move this dog right over here, and I'm going to close
the oven," she said, as she arranged her kitchen and prepared
a meal of chocolate-chip cookies. But she was ultimately disappointed
 "I don't know where the can opener is so I can open the dog
food."

Her favorite game was the ice- cream maker in the kitchen; kids
can create bizarre flavors to their heart's--or heartburn's
-content.

"This is going to be totally disgusting," Abbe said as she prepared
to make a batch of asparagus ice cream.

But as much as she seemed to enjoy exploring the dollhouse and
befriending the characters within the program, Abbe complained
that "mostly you just click and drag things around."

In the end, it didn't feel to Abbe like the kind of place she'd
want to call home.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Madeline still speaks 
little girls' language

By:
Carol Ellison

Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show

Ages 5 and up

Exploration/game

3 stars

Madeline, the star of storybooks, toys and even her own Saturday
morning TV show, has at last arrived on the PC. And there's
little doubt that girls of all ages will love this charming
disc.

The narration, by actor Christopher Plummer, frees children
who have not yet learned to read from the feelings of frustration
that come with stumbling through printed directions. Older
girls, meanwhile, can match pictures to words in English, French
and Spanish.

Lisa, 8, played a match game in English, then in French. When
she was done, Madeline congratulated her: "You did wonderfully.
Let's try something harder." But Lisa said non, and instead
dove back into the main adventure, finding everything she needed
to stage a puppet show to raise money to help a neighbor pay
his rent.

Although the solution to the mystery remains the same every
time kids play, many of the activities are open-ended; for
instance, players can paint different scenes as the backdrops
for their show, or dress the puppets differently each time.

"There's this attic, and you have to get up there to make the
puppets," 6-year-old Laura explained, then added that she hadn't
yet found what she needed to lower the attic stairs from the
ceiling--and quickly went back to work.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: For kids, sand's fun, 
the hourglass is not

By:
Carol Ellison

Trudy's Time and Place House

Ages 3 to 6

Readiness

2 1/2 stars

Trudy's Time and Place House is the latest entry in the normally
outstanding series of "House" preschool programs (see Kid Raves,
November 1994). But time and place are tough ideas for little
ones to grasp; this disc requires parents to be on hand to
put concepts in context.

Laura, 6, tackled a game that took her into space to view a
global map. She reacted with glee when she recognized a picture
of China's Summer Palace as "just like in the Great Movie ride
in Disney World," referring to the video of Mann's Chinese
Theater she'd seen there. Only when her mom directed her to
click on New York, where they live, and the program showed
the Statue of Liberty did the young traveler get her bearings.

More to Laura's age level--and liking--was the sandbox where
kids make their own topographical map by dropping symbols of
mountains, hills, rivers and towns into the sand. "Beautiful!"
declared Laura, as she admired the hills and valleys she'd
created.

Trudy's Time and Place House offers excellent instruction, but
parents should be sure the exercises are appropriate for each
child, or they may produce more frustration than fun.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Inside the Kids' Lab: 
Kids' icons are the friends on screen

By:
Carol Ellison

Sometimes, kids' software just can't stack up to a cute stuffed
animal. Children can't take the computer to bed with them at
night, cuddle a keyboard or curl up with a computer mouse on
a long road trip. But they do find a way to bring whatever
they love into their lives--and that includes their favorite
computer characters.

We learned that lesson during this month's software tests in
the HomePC Kids' Lab, where children of all ages try out software
and let us observe--and learn from--their reactions. This month,
our younger testers revealed how easily they get attached to
stellar software characters as friends and playmates. "Her
-she's my favorite," said Abbe, pointing out a mouse in the
Fisher-Price Dream Dollhouse. "Then her. Then her. Then him.
Then him," she added, pointing to the other residents in her
virtual home. And how much do kids love Putt-Putt? Brian and
Laura, both 6, kissed the little car on the screen, while Thomas
and Michael, both 5, rushed to hug the monitor.

Speaking of hugs, we send ours to all the young experts in our
Lab, as well as to the adults who helped bring you this month's
reviews. Thanks to preschoolers Michael Adamo, Benjamin Herman
and Thomas Volpe; and students Gabriel Ayache, Brian Corrigan,
Drew D'Agostino, Cara and Laura Forte, Abbe and Lisa Goldberg,
Alex Hyman, Jason Marder, Duwan McCormick, Stephanie McCarty,
Eric Rahamin and David Wasley. Special thanks also to the CMP
Publications' Child Care Center, its director Ann Erbes, and
teacher Debbie Doyle; Kids' Lab assistant Karen Garber; and
editorial assistant Keith Kirkpatrick.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Learning: How Net links enrich CDs

By:
Warren Buckleitner

This year, each of the three top-selling encyclopedias on CD
ROM--Compton's, Encarta and Grolier--includes an on-line feature
that lets you download up-to-date articles to your PC. But
those late-breaking links are just a hint of what's to come
as children's software merges with the information highway.
Bill Gross, the founder of Knowledge Adventure (which publishes
the popular Bug Adventure and Jump*Start software), believes
1996 "will be the year educational software stops being antisocial."
In his view, the software of tomorrow will be designed not
for one or two players at a single keyboard, but for kids all
around the world connected by the Internet for collaborative
education.

For instance, Knowledge Adventure aims to link its children's
reference discs to an on-line research service called Homework
Helper. Children will be able to learn more about subjects
covered in the software by clicking on an icon that accesses
Homework Helper automatically. Once connected, they can supplement
the software by reading up-to-date sources, including publications
and transcripts of National Public Radio broadcasts, and by
chatting with other kids using the service.

Kids with Internet access playing Headbone Interactive's AlphaBonk
Farm (see Kid Raves, May 1995) can jump from the game to Headbone's
Web page to read Svelt Velma the Sow's daily horoscope. And
fans of the company's Elroy Goes Bugzerk (Kid Raves, October
1995) can send messages to Elroy's e-mail address.

Thanks to the Internet, children can even participate in software
development. Last year, MECC involved classrooms in the production
of MayaQuest, which simulates a trip back in time to explore
the Mayan empire. Kids followed the adventures of MECC's developers
through Mayan ruins on the Yucatan peninsula--without leaving
their keyboards.

Warren Buckleitner is the editor of the Children's Software
Revue in Ypsilanti, Mich.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: Kids' keyboards: 
Two types for tykes

By:
Carol Ellison

Most keyboards for kids are essentially standard keyboards dressed
up in childlike themes, but two models turn a PC into a brand
new toy. Vtech's Sound and Learning System and the Comfy Keyboard
are both charming, easy to connect and fun. We gave the 25
tykes in the CMP Publications Child Care Center in Manhasset,
N.Y., a chance to put them to the test.

The keyboard king? Comfy, by a nose. Age-rated for children
from 1 to 6 years old, the $129 Comfy (Windows 3.1, Macintosh
due in January) comes with one CD-ROM or floppy disk; other
programs are available for $24-34 each. The keyboard's buttons
are marked with pictures instead of letters, which makes the
Comfy great for little ones.

Vtech's $79.99 Sound Learning Keyboard (DOS), designed for children
3 to 7, features raised letter keys in alphabetical order,
a style suited for kids just learning to read. It comes with
one program on floppy disks; two others are sold separately
for $19.99. One drawback: The Vtech system's "escape" keys
are adjacent to all the others, inviting curious kids to constantly
-if inadvertently--boot themselves out of a program. And the
Vtech requires batteries, which--you guessed it--are not included.

Kid Raves--Our Young Experts Rate Software: For ill children, 
PCs are just what the doctor ordered

By:
Carol Ellison

If you think high-tech toys are just fun and games, think again.
They "may have direct clinical benefit" in helping sick kids
get well, says Dr. Melvin Marks, medical director at Miller
Children's Hospital, in Long Beach, Calif.

Not long after Miller's staff began rolling televisions and
video games on trolleys called "fun centers" to the children's
bedsides, child-life specialist Rita Bright noticed that Super
Mario and his animated friends seemed to have a very soothing
-and even a therapeutic--effect on the kids.

When the Starlight Foundation, a wish-granting organization
for critically ill children, heard the news, it funded additional
trolleys--this time equipped with PCs--and a special children's
high-tech room at Miller and four other hospitals around the
world. A subsequent preliminary study at the University of
Southern California showed that there is more to entertainment
therapy than anyone suspected--and the results of the study
led to the formation of Starbright, a sister foundation developing
entertaining computer programs to provide medical information
to children and relieve the anxieties and suffering of those
with serious illnesses. The foundation has the backing of a
star-studded lineup of supporters, including film director
Steven Spielberg.

Starbright's chief project is a $60 million computer network
linking high-tech playrooms in eight pediatric hospitals across
the United States. Spielberg hopes one day to expand the network
around the world, allowing patients to log on, choose an electronic
persona--or "avatar"--from more than 150 characters designed
by his animators, and play together in a virtual world. Currently,
kids can fly their avatars through the clouds, race down a
drag strip or join one another to explore a cave. Or, they
can pop into a videoconference to see and talk with children
in other hospitals.

According to Spielberg, the inspiration for the network came
from a young cancer patient who asked the director if he could
turn on the light in E.T.'s finger, so E.T. could reach out
and touch the boy and return his life to normal. Of course,
that request was beyond what E.T.--and Spielberg--could do.
But with the network and other high-tech interventions, Spielberg
says, the diversion provided by fun and entertainment can help
relieve the pain felt by that child and others, and "take us
a long way toward that dream."

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: In an age of Model T's, 
this PC's a Corvette

By:
Fred Davis

Acer Aspire 2136

Computer

3 stars

Computer design is no longer simply a question of motherboards,
microchips and cables; consumers are beginning to look at PCs
as home furnishings, and they expect to see a little visual
style with their technical substance. The Acer Aspire 2136
sets a terrific example for this new breed--its dramatic angles
form one of the sharpest-looking PCs around.

The Aspire owes its singular good looks to a renowned high-tech
design firm in Sunnyvale, Calif., called frogdesign.  Instead of
a motley assemblage of boxy hardware and peripherals, the 2136
carefully coordinates its pieces The case, monitor, keyboard and
mouse come in slate gray or mossy green, unified by graceful,
flowing, futuristic lines.

Of course, the Aspire's design would mean little if its triumphs
were merely aesthetic; happily, it's functional, too. For instance,
holes in the monitor and case look cool--and keep the system
cool as well. The front panel of the PC case flips up to reveal
a handle; opening the case is simply a matter of grabbing the
handle and pulling it out.

Inside, the Aspire holds a potent 100-MHz Pentium chip, 16 megabytes
of RAM and a 1.2-gigabyte hard drive. The system includes a
quad-speed CD-ROM drive, 16-bit sound card, and 28.8-Kbps modem
with fax, answering-machine and voicemail capabilities. The
keyboard (which comes with a wrist rest) and mouse are both
color-coordinated and comfortable to use.

We breezed through our installation and setup in roughly 10
minutes, thanks to the system's color-coded cables and corresponding
connectors. The 2136 comes preloaded with Windows 95, and adds
a nice selection of on-line communications, education and entertainment
software to the mix.

The one disappointment in the model we tested was its 14-inch
monitor (which adds $299 to the base price). The built-in speakers
and integrated multimedia cable are nice touches, but the small
screen delivered somewhat fuzzy images. The 15-inch version
sells for $399; that may seem a pretty penny for an extra inch
of real estate, but it makes this stylish system a much more
attractive buy. $2,299 with 16 MB of RAM, 1.2-GB hard drive
and quad-speed CD-ROM drive (monitor sold separately), from
Acer America, (800) 309-2237, (408) 432-6200.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: The perfect computer 
for Little Jack Horner

Packard Bell Multimedia Corner Computer

Computer

3 1/2 stars

Talk about cornering a market: The Packard Bell Multimedia Corner
Computer is the first personal computer designed to fit snugly
into the least intrusive part of a room.

Packard Bell turned to frogdesign--the same firm that created
the Acer Aspire (see above)--to give its systems a face-lift.
Compared with the Aspire, the Corner Computer looks clunky,
and its case doesn't open as easily. But the way the PC angles
neatly into the corner of a room or desk, letting you reclaim
precious living or work space, is a real innovation.

While you'll find the model hanging out in corners, it isn't
loitering; this is one of Packard Bell's most powerful PCs.
Its 100-MHz Pentium processor and top-notch components achieved
some of the best performance results we've seen yet from Packard
Bell, which has taken some heat in the past for selling systems
with below-average components. But in the Wintune 2.0 tests
we ran--a set of benchmark performance comparisons--the Corner
Computer's RAM, video and hard drive results were more impressive
than those of the Acer Aspire 2136.

The unit we tested came with 16 megabytes of RAM, a 1.6-gigabyte
hard drive, a quad-speed CD-ROM drive, and a built-in TV tuner
and FM radio. The MPEG video system was fast and responsive,
and it delivers full-screen, full-motion playback from your
CD-ROMs. On the downside, the Corner Computer includes a 14.4

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: IBM passes screen test 
with flying colors

By:
Julie Cohen

IBM ThinkPad 365CD

Multimedia notebook PC

3 stars

Portable-PC lovers' hearts may flutter when they see the rainbow
of colors on the ThinkPad 365CD multimedia notebook's screen,
but, ultimately, this system is more functional than it is
fun.

The 365CD has its share of snazzy features for the price: a
built-in double-speed CD-ROM drive, built-in sound and an active
matrix color screen. However, as with any notebook PC, portability
requires a few compromises: You'll need an external drive (included
in the base price) to use floppy disks, and there's only one
speaker.

Of course, the big compromise comes in overall performance,
which generally suffers compared with similarly equipped desktop
models. The ThinkPad packs an Intel-compatible 75-MHz 486DX4
chip, 8 megabytes of memory and a 540-MB hard drive, yet in
Wintune performance tests, it more closely resembled a 66-MHz
486DX2 desktop PC.

And yet, there is that screen. The active-matrix, 640-by-480
display delivers colors as vivid as you could hope for. And
at 10.4 inches diagonally, you'll have plenty of room to enjoy
them.

IBM also lets you take your pick of operating systems--either
Windows 3.11 and IBM's OS/2 Warp, or Windows 95 alone.

The ThinkPad 365CD isn't perfect, but it is a complete, portable
multimedia PC; road warriors can count on it to deliver value
-and color--if not the flash of a pricier notebook.

$3,000 with 8 MB of RAM, 540-MB hard drive, built-in double
speed CD-ROM drive and active-matrix display, from IBM, (800)
426-2968, (914) 766-1900.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: 8X is fast--
but CDs still need to catch up

By:
Julie Cohen

Diamond Multimedia Kit 8000

8X multimedia upgrade kit

2 1/2 stars

The Diamond Multimedia Kit 8000 comes with everything you need
to turn your system into a screamer: a state-of-the-art 8X
CD-ROM drive, 16-bit wavetable sound card and Yamaha YST-M5
3-watt speakers that deliver rich sound--all serving to enhance
the kit's stellar software selection, which includes favorites
such as Myst and Star Wars Rebel Assault. It's a fine package
-but it may still be racing a bit too far ahead of the technological
curve to justify its price.

At this point, the benefits of the 8X CD-ROM drive haven't quite
been realized. There's an advantage to using an 8X device,
but the real boost in speed comes in file transfer, not file
access.

The 1,200-kilobyte-per-second transfer rate dramatically speeds
the time it takes to transfer information from a CD-ROM to
your hard drive. On a Pentium-based Packard Bell Legend 814CD
PC, for example, the Diamond CD-ROM drive transferred 125 MB
of information in two minutes and 25 seconds; Packard Bell's
quad-speed CD-ROM drive took three minutes and 38 seconds.

But when we used the drive for research, we found no big difference
in search performance. And most game software today is still
designed for double-speed drives.

If the idea of installing a multimedia upgrade kit sends shivers
down your spine, the Diamond package may confirm your worst
fears. Plugging in the hardware components is easy enough,
but configuring the essential driver software took several
calls to Diamond Multimedia's courteous technical-support department.

Although the box says the kit complies with the Plug-and-Play
standard, we needed new drivers to install it under Windows
95--and even then it took a close reading of a one-page addendum
to the manual to finish the job. San Jose, Calif.-based Diamond
Multimedia offers no toll-free support, so your long-distance
company will determine what any similar problems will cost
you.

Should you spring for an 8X CD-ROM drive? It all depends on
how much you're willing to pay today--in time and money--to
get a jump on tomorrow's technology.

$599 (Windows 3.1, Windows 95) from Diamond Multimedia, (800)
468-5846, (408) 325-7000.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: Color costs a smidge, 
but print may smudge

By:
Michael J. Zulich

Lexmark Color Jetprinter 1020

Color ink jet printer

2 stars

Lexmark International is one of the companies now making inexpensive
color printing a reality. Unfortunately, the company's latest
entry, the Color Jetprinter 1020, sacrifices a little too much
performance for pizzazz.

Lexmark packs this ink jet printer with alluring features such
as 600-by-300-dpi color resolution, a 100-page input tray,
CorelDraw 3 on CD-ROM, and ColorFine 2, Lexmark's multifaceted
Windows driver. Two ink cartridges, a black one for text and
a cyan-magenta-yellow combination for color, are included with
the machine, as is a handy cartridge holder to keep the unused
ink moist. And installation is a breeze: Just connect the printer
to a PC, plug in the power cord, install the ink and the drivers,
and start printing. Lexmark provides illustrated instructions,
but you probably won't even need them. The printer drivers
come on one disk; installation requires little more than typing
setup.

In fact, the drivers may be the printer's standout feature.
They give you control over many functions, including resolution,
print quality, paper type, color use and image handling (an
automatic option helps if you'd rather not make all those decisions).
A pop-up window displays print-job status and ink level. If
your PC has a sound card, you'll even get spoken warnings if
something's wrong. Try to print without paper or with the wrong
ink cartridge installed, for example, and the software tells
you there's a problem; detailed, context-sensitive on-screen
help will guide you as you make the necessary corrections.

Unfortunately, these features are far more impressive than the
printer's performance. It outputs only about two text pages
per minute in automatic mode; that's too slow for our taste.
The print speed picks up by only about 15 to 20 percent in
draft mode, which appears to be primarily an ink-saving measure.

Text quality on plain paper was fuzzy using the automatic mode,
but it cleared up when we used heavier--and more expensive
-cotton-bond paper. Color images fared better; we saw just
the slightest banding, and dither patterns (the small ink dots
that make up the colors of a picture) were barely noticeable.
The Jetprinter accepted all kinds of paper and envelopes without
a hitch, but the ink was prone to smearing when moist.

The Color Jetprinter 1020 deserves high praise for its terrific
driver, and the price is nice. But if performance is the deciding
factor when you shop, its mediocre print quality and slow output
may take too big a toll.

$226 (Windows 3.1) from Lexmark International, (800) 358-5835,
(606) 232-2000.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: Net telephones today? 
You make the call

By:
John Eckhouse

 
Jabra-net

PC phone and headset

2 stars

The Jabra-net promises to turn your PC into a convenient hands
free telephone. It's a marvelous engineering feat, but the
effort it takes to get the necessary software to work may undermine
its general--and practical--appeal.

The Jabra-net plugs into your PC's sound card and provides excellent
sound quality. Using it with the Jabra Ear Phone, which contains
both a speaker and a microphone in one extremely small, lightweight
piece, makes the Jabra-net far less annoying to use than a
typical telephone headset. It's also a lot handier than using
a microphone and speakers for your phone calls.

With a Sound Blaster-compatible sound card and TAPI-compatible
modem (the Telephony Application Programmers Interface, a fairly
new standard, allows a modem to handle both voice and data
at the same time), you can use the Ear Phone and included PC
Phone software to dial and answer your telephone directly from
your computer. Or, you can make virtually free long-distance
calls around the world via VocalTec's Internet Phone software
(to use it, you need an account with an Internet service provider)

We received calls from Germany, Israel and Maryland through
the Internet software; the sound quality was fine on the domestic
call, but voices broke up frequently during international conversations.
In addition, it's a half-duplex system, which means it's more
akin to a walkie-talkie than a telephone--only one person can
talk at a time.

And for all the comforts of its Ear Phone system, Jabra seems
to know far too little about the software it packs in the box,
or the modems and sound cards that make the product work. We
ran into vexing installation problems with both a new TAPI
modem and the PC Phone software, but neither Jabra, the PC
Phone technicians, nor the modem maker would take responsibility
for solving all the difficulties we described over the (standard)
telephone. After six hours of struggle and repeated calls for
help, we were unable to get the PC Phone software to work under
either Windows 3.1 or Windows 95.

It doesn't minimize Jabra's accomplishments to say its ambitious
product may need a little more seasoning before it's ready
for a wide audience. But you might want to let the evolving
technical pieces fall into place before you lend the Jabra
net system an ear.

$99 (Windows 3.1) from Jabra, (800) 327-2230, (619) 622-0764.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: 
CD-R backup seems a little ahead of its time

By:
Oliver Rist

Hewlett-Packard SureStore 4020i CD-Writer

CD-Recordable storage device

2 1/2 stars

With the SureStore 4020i CD-Writer, Hewlett-Packard is introducing
recordable-CD technology to consumers for use as a backup or
extra storage device. But a $1,099 price tag and serious configuration
snags with SCSI drives make it unlikely the product will be
welcome in most homes anytime soon.

The AdvanSys SCSI adapter card that ships with the SureStore
fully complies with the Plug-and-Play standard. If your computer
has Windows 95 and an IDE hard drive, you probably won't face
major conflicts. No such luck if your system has a SCSI hard
drive: The SureStore doesn't work with all SCSI controllers,
and installation can result in stubborn snags.

The SureStore comes with two blank 650-megabyte CD-R discs ($16
apiece), but it does not provide the rails that slide it into
a computer's drive bay, nor an MPC audio connector, which you'll
need if you want to hear sound. Both are essential.

The SureStore's quad-speed disc-reading functions worked well
in our tests, with performance comparable to typical CD-ROM
drives. HP includes a utility that lets you play audio CDs,
and Mag-ic Lantern software, which lets you view Kodak Photo
CDs.

But recording to a CD isn't so straightforward. HP ships three
applications that use the drive's capability: Alchemy Personal
is a file-retrieval database that works with either your hard
drive or a CD. Easy-CD is a simple file recorder for CD-R devices;
it performs well as long as you're copying a relatively small
number of files from your hard drive to the SureStore--but
if you're copying data from a CD-ROM to the device, you'll
have to copy the files onto your hard drive first.

Finally, Easy-CD Audio will record any songs you select from
a regular audio CD onto your hard drive, then copy them to
a CD-R. But if you're thinking about pirating your favorite
music CDs, think again: You'd have to convert the audio tracks
into .wav files, which won't run on an audio-only CD player.

$1,099 (Windows 3.1) from Hewlett-Packard, (800) 810-0134, (415)
857-1501.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: 
PC phone's a real conversation piece

By:
Julie Cohen

AT&T Computer Telephone 8130

PC phone

2 1/2 stars

If you want to use a PC as a phone center but don't need a system
as cutting-edge as the Jabra-net, consider AT&T's Computer
Telephone 8130, the first traditional style phone to connect to a
PC.

The 8130 looks like a standard business phone with a few extra
cords in the back--two connect to wall jacks, one hooks up
to your computer's serial port, and one connects to an electrical
outlet. The two-line speakerphone sports an LCD showing the
date, time, and caller's name or telephone number (if you've
subscribed to Caller ID). You can program up to 18 phone numbers
in its memory and make conference calls, too.

But what makes the phone special is its PC connection. Attach
the standard 9-pin serial cable, install AT&T's call-log software,
and you've got a mechanized receptionist. Every time you place
or receive a call, the log will store the date, time, duration
and phone number. Jot down conversation highlights with the
note-taking feature, and you have a handy record of the exchange.
You can also sort the information at your computer by name,
phone number or date.

The software comes with a phone directory that lets you store
information on up to 5,000 contacts; you can dial any of them
instantly at the click of a button.

This phone is purely a home product; it requires an analog phone
jack and does not work with the digital phone systems common
in offices--say, one that requires you to dial 9 to access
an outside line. And if you don't need extensive record-keeping
capabilities, you don't need the Computer Telephone 8130. But
for folks with a free serial port and a need to keep detailed
notes, it'll get you off the hook in style.

$199 (Windows 3.1) from AT&T, (800) 233-2650, (201) 581-3000.

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: For a design innovator, 
PC style isn't business as usual

By:
Julie Cohen

When Acer America and Packard Bell decided they wanted their
new computers to look like they belonged in a stylish home
rather than a sterile office, each turned to frogdesign of
Sunnyvale, Calif., the firm that dreamt up the striking looks
for such landmarks of computer style as the Apple IIc and PowerBook.
For these new projects, the firm set out to meet two distinct
design objectives--one internal, the other external.

For Acer, the goal was to make consumers sit up and take notice
of the company's new home computers; frogdesign visualized
a system that would look more like furniture than office equipment.
"People put their PCs all over the place," says design manager
Matt Barthelemy. "It was critical that we design something
that would fit in anywhere in the home." That meant more than
just a smattering of color accents. The final product, the
Acer Aspire 2136, expresses a personality in fresh shapes,
bold colors and innovative proportions. The desktop version's
monitor and CPU fit together for an integrated look that sidesteps
limits imposed by traditional all-in-one systems; the mini
tower version sports so many playful touches--from a rounded
front to cute little feet--it might remind you of a silly seal
hamming it up to please a crowd at the aquarium.

While Acer focused on presenting a friendly face to the outside
world, Packard Bell wanted to reorganize its computer's internal
components to achieve revolutionary efficiency in its use of
space. The Multimedia Corner Computer frees up valuable real
estate on cluttered desktops. According to frogdesign project
leader Gadi Amit, the Packard Bell line was inspired by the
functions of multimedia; frogdesign cleverly hit on a form
that calls to mind an amphitheater, with speakers and components
built around a cylindrical shape.

Despite the seemingly radical new designs, Amit says his firm
knows there are limits to what computer shoppers will accept
when it comes to high-tech fashion. "There's a threshold we
try not to pass," he says. "Some of our best designs stay right
here."

Gear + Gadgets--Your Guide To New Hardware: 'Stripping' 
PCs to drive down prices

By:
Keith Kirkpatrick

Today, buying a home computer usually means spending at least
$1,500. But if companies such as Sun Microsystems, Oracle and
Apple Computer follow through with plans to introduce systems
designed for easy Internet access--and little else--you might
be able to buy a PC for $500.

Sun believes the Internet is the backbone of tomorrow's desktop
and is developing budget-priced machines with very small hard
drives; the company is betting you'll soon be able to download
any key computing resource from the Internet rather than store
it locally. The devices would work with the Sun-developed Java
programming language, which enables small applications to reside
in cyberspace. The idea is that you'd download such "applets"
and use them for as long as need them; when you're done, they'd
disappear from your hard drive.

Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, meanwhile, has announced his company's
intention to introduce a "Network Computer"--which will support
word processing, e-mail and Internet browsing--early this year.
The machine will have no hard drive, floppy drive or applications,
with all programs coming from the Internet. Similarly, Apple's
forthcoming Pippin system will function as a nontechnical "appliance"
that can run CD-ROM titles and use Internet services--but won't
be compatible with either Macintoshes or PCs. Apple had not
set a U.S. release date for Pippin when we went to press.
