<PRE><STRONG><H2>Diseases and Pests of Roses</H2></STRONG>
     Once   you   have  begun  to  provide  for  a  proper  nutritional
environment,  you  must  provide  protection  until  balance  has  been
regained.  You can protect your roses from thrips, aphids and other pest
attacks thru several different methods: Planting garlic at base of rose
will  deter pest attacks. Society garlic is also very effective.  You
can  also make a garlic oil spray.  Purchase garlic oil from your  local
grocery store. If they don't have garlic oil, buy garlic butter.  Add  1
tablespoon to a quart water sprayer. Make sure to strain before pouring
into sprayer to prevent  clogging.

  Another  method you can use to control pests on your roses  is  to
bury tobacco around the base of your roses. For best results take 1 cup
dried  tobacco (use only organically grown tobacco if possible),  «  cup
garlic powder and mix into this 1 cup compost.  Bury at base of rose  by
turning over into the soil.  A better method and one which I prefer, is
to  get  a  small clay drain pipe (opened at both ends, about  3  inches
wide,  12  inches long (smaller for roses, larger for trees) and  bury
that at the base of the rose bush or plant, level with the ground. Into
this  place the mixture TGC+™(equal amounts of organic tobacco,  garlic
powder, compost and the + stands for trace minerals such as rock dust).
Use  1 lb per unit. On top of this place either a pretty rock or a nice
clay  pot to cover it, or simply mulch over, remembering where  it  is.
This mixture should be replaced once per year or as often as needed.

  You  can  also  use pebbles as a mulch to cover it, just  remember
where it is. For this rose vent to be effective, there should be a drip
head  (2 gallons per hour) to allow water to pass thru it. The TGC+ will
be  absorbed  by  the  rose, Ficus etc, and it will  kill  the  thrips,
aphids,  etc., as they attack the rose leaves (anything that eats  these
leaves will die!). Tobacco and garlic are both absorbed into the plant,
anything that attacks the plant will also get this mixture. The tobacco
will kill any insect that attacks it. The Tobacco is very volatile  and
will biodegrade within 24 hrs if in liquid form; will last longer if it
is  in a dust or in its natural leaf state.  Do not use tobacco on fruit
trees. The garlic will change the taste of the plant confusing the bug.

<STRONG><H3>Tabasco Soap?</H3></STRONG>
     Another  spray formula to use to control thrips, aphids  and  most
pests:  add 1 tablespoon tabasco sauce, 1 tablespoon natural soap  such
as Dr. Bronners Peppermint Soap to a quart water spray bottle. This can
be sprayed onto the leaves and around base of plants. It will repel and
kill thrips, aphids, etc. You can alternatively add 1 tablespoon garden
grade DE.


<STRONG><H3>DE</H3></STRONG>
     Diatomaceous  Earth  is a natural dust used  to  control  crawling
insects, beetles, ants, aphids, spiders, snails, etc. DE can be used in
many  ways.  Can be added to water, strained and then sprayed.  Use  10
tablespoons per gallon filtered water. DE can be made into a paste  and
then  painted  around  the base of the roses to  prevent  caterpillars,
snails,  etc., from climbing up to eat the flowers. When using DE,  you
must  be  careful  to  avoid breathing  or  eye  contact,  due  to  its
abrasiveness.  Garden  grade  DE is perfectly  safe (pool  grade  DE  is
dangerous)  to  use but it is a dust and should be handled  with  care.
Wear a face mask when using and wash with water if it gets in your eye.
Don't  rub  your  eyes,  remember DE is like thousands  of  tiny  razor
blades.  Water will wash it away.For more information on DE see index.

<STRONG><H2>Controlling Aphids and Ants on Roses</H2></STRONG>

  The  other day I had a caller on my radio show.  She had  heard  my
previous  remarks  to  a caller concerning ants and  aphids  and  their
relationship. This caller was certain that only some aphids are  herded
by  ants  and that most fly from place to place totally indifferent  to
what  the ants have to say about it.  It is just the opposite; most
aphids  are  under the control of their ant masters. I also have  found
it  to  be  true  that by controlling the ants, you  obtain  a  greater
control of the aphids which are attacking your roses, etc. There  is  a
definite  relationship between various insects, in  particular  aphids,
which  are found on plants, and ants. The ants control most if not  all
insect activity on plants which they have 'adopted'.

    Plants  under the care of the ants are protected by them  and  are
also used as a source of food either for them directly thru the sap  or
pollen  of  the  plant or indirectly thru the use of aphids  and  other
insects  which attack the plant and which in turn are `milked'  by  the
ants  (for their nectar). Changing the behavior of the ants is  a  very
important  factor in controlling many pests in the home and  garden  as
well as controlling the ants themselves.  This is developing a line  of
communication  between  the  ants  and  yourself.  Ants  are   uniquely
positioned  in  the  insect kingdom.  They are  intelligent  enough  to
remember.  Ant memory works in a very direct way. They are  programmed
by  nature to behave in a certain way.  Their actions are controlled  by
certain  factors  in their environment. Control these factors  and  you
control the ants.  Quiet Control is what you seek.  It is not neccessary
to  kill  them. For more information on ants see chapter  "Dances  with
Ants".

<STRONG><H3>Getting A Hold</H3></STRONG>
     Raise  the energy level of the soil; in turn you will have  higher
energy  levels of the rose, vegetable or plant. The higher  the  energy
level  of the soil, the healthier the rose, the less stressed and   the
less  pests  your  roses  will have attacking  them.  Ants  respond  to
imbalance and stress.

<STRONG><H3>Give Caesar his Due</H3></STRONG>
     Feeding  the  ants will reduce their activity in  other  parts  of
their kingdom (our yard and house). Ants, like most creatures except man,
follow  the  path of least resistance.  Ants are good  at  this.  If  an
endless food source has been found, they will use it to the benefit  of
their colony. Ants will not have to go looking for food as long as they
get what they need. The basic idea is to provide for the ants a feeding
center,  see Ant Cafes™chapter one. Set up at least one Ant  Cafe  near
by.  By  providing them a food source, we can begin to retrain them  to
come  for food here and to stop looking for food in the kitchen, or  on
the  roses,  etc..  This is a simple system that can become  your  most
effective control method against the ants.

<STRONG><H3>Using  Natural Barriers to keep Ants/Aphids off</H3></STRONG>
     Tanglefoot  works  well for this. You can add  cayenne  pepper  to
increase its effectiveness. Other barriers to keep ants  and aphids off
are  Tabasco sauce  and a natural soap sprayed on base and  on  leaves.
Use  1  tablespoon of ea in 1 quart water. A good soap to  use  is  Dr.
Bronners Peppermint soap which is available at most health food stores.
Any natural soap which has a strong fragrance will work, Peppermint  is
very  effective for this purpose.    There are many natural  fungicides
that are used to control Downey Mildew, Rust, BlackSpot, Powdery Mildew
and  other exotic diseases,but by now you should get the idea that  the
basis  for  regaining the health of the roses and other  plants  is  to
regain the health of the soil.  The an important word here is "Exotic".
This is very important to understand. "Exotic" diseases can be directly
correlated  to the lack of "Exotic" trace minerals. Usually  it  is  an
absence  of,  rather  than the presence of these exotic  minerals,  that
triggers  the  effect (which is the disease). This  is  also  true  for
common diseases.

 To regain control of any such disease, you must regain the balance
of  the  eco-system that the plant is growing in. Check soil PH levels,
Check  for  excessive salt levels such as boron, chlorine,  etc.  Check
watering  habits and equipment. Use a garden filter to filter  out  the
chlorine.  Check your composting/fertilizer habits, Switch over  slowly
to organics.  See more info on Dances with Ants chapter.

<STRONG><H3>Vit C?</H3></STRONG>

  Vit  C  is an effective way of controlling aphids on your roses.
Use  a liquid vit c and spray several times per week or as needed.  Use
about 1,000 units per quart of water.
