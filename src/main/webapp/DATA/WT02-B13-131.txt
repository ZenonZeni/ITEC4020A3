<a name="RTFToC2">States
Sue Federal Government</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>California Governor Pete Wilson sued the federal government on April 29,
1994 for reimbursement of $377 million that the state will spend this year on
the 17,000 illegal aliens held in state correctional facilities.  On April 23,
President Clinton attempted to head off such suits by asking Congress to
allocate $350 million to reimburse states for the expenses they incur to jail
undocumented aliens; if the crime bill passes, and the funds are appropriated,
$200 million would go to California.  In an effort to keep the limelight on
illegal immigration, Wilson on April 29 ordered 127 members of the California
National Guard to go to the US-Mexican border to assist the Border Patrol in
its efforts to prevent illegal immigration.  <p>
<p>
On April 12, Florida sued the federal government for reimbursement of the $1.5
billion that the state has spent for the past two years on illegal aliens, and
for "prescriptive relief" from future costs.  The Florida cost estimate did not
include any revenues generated from illegal aliens.  Two years ago, New York
sued the federal government, claiming it should reimburse the state for the
costs of keeping illegal aliens in prison.  That lawsuit is still pending.
Since 1994 is an election year, the Clinton Administration is under pressure to
estimate more exactly the costs that states and cities incur to provide
services to illegal immigrants, and to provide some monetary relief.<p>

<a name="RTFToC3">Illegal
Immigration:  Numbers, Benefits, and Costs in California</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
California has been at the forefront of the debate over whether the federal
government should reimburse states for the costs they incur to serve illegal
immigrants.  Over 300 people attended an April 29, 1994 conference in
Sacramento, California to hear presentations on the number and the benefits and
costs of unauthorized immigrants.  <p>
<p>
There is far more consensus on the number of unauthorized immigrants than  on
their benefits and costs.  For example, the consensus is that there are about
1.6 million unauthorized immigrants in California. However, there is much less
consensus on how much these immigrants pay in taxes and cost in services, and
this uncertainty, combined with inabilityof experts to predict the future
trajectory of the illegal immigrants and the economy, means that there is
evidence on both sides of the central question: will the unauthorized
immigrants arriving today be a future benefit or burden?<p>
<p>
<u>Background</u><p>
<u></u>In January 1994, Governor Wilson estimated  that the state incurred $2.3
billion in unreimbursed costs to provide federally-mandated services to
unauthorized immigrants--$1.7 billion for education, $377 million for
corrections, and $300 million for health care costs.  The corrections and
health care cost estimates are based on counts of unauthorized aliens
incarcerated and served; the education cost estimate is based on the estimated
number of illegal aliens in the state.<p>
<p>
Wilson argues that, since the federal government has exclusive control over
immigration policy, the federal government should reimburse states for all of
the costs they incur to provide services to unauthorized immigrants, especially
those services, such as tuition-free education for school-age children, that
the federal government or courts require the states to provide.  Once the
principle of federal reimbursement is established, there remains the question
of how much the federal government should pay.<p>
<p>
There is near agreement on the cost of providing these services to unauthorized
immigrants and their children, e.g., incarcerating a prisoner in California
costs about $22,000 per year.  The number of illegal aliens is the critical
variable in determining how many illegal alien children there are and thus how
much federal reimbursement California can expect. [Some argue that only the
marginal cost of services for illegal aliens should be reimbursed, since there
would be, e.g., a criminal justice system even if there were no illegal aliens.
Marginal costs could be higher than average costs, if new schools or prisons
had to be built; or lower, if the aliens fill otherwise vacant slots]. <p>
<p>
<u>Numbers</u><p>
There was apparent consensus on four points:  1) the number of illegal aliens
in the US  today is about 3.8 million; 2) their number is increasing by about
300,000 annually; 3) the California share of the illegal alien population
decreased from 50 percent in the mid-1980s to about 43 percent; and, 4) the
Mexican share of US illegal aliens has decreased from 61 percent in the
mid-1980s to about 39 percent.  These data are from the INS paper cited
below.<p>
<p>
When Wilson's staff was preparing the budget in January 1994, they used an
"unofficial" estimate that there were four million unauthorized aliens in the
US, and 2.1 million in California.  Wilson requested a $2.3 billion federal
reimbursement, or roughly $1,000 per illegal alien in the state.<p>
<p>
There are several benchmark estimates of the illegal alien population in the
US.  Based on an analysis of Census data, it was estimated that there were 2.1
million illegal aliens in 1980.  This number then increased--by an average
388,000 annually--so that in early 1987, there were thought to be about 4.8
million illegal aliens in the US.  Three million of these illegal aliens
applied for legalization in 1987-88, including 1.6 million or 53 percent in
California.<p>
<p>
There is a now a rough consensus on what happened since 1987-88.  The Census
estimates that there were about 3. 5 million illegal aliens in the US in 1992,
including 1.2 to 1.7 million in California.  The INS, using a different
methodology, estimated that there were 3.4 million, including 1.4 million in
October 1992.   The California Department of Finance, estimated that there were
2.6 million unauthorized US residents in 1993, including 1.3 million in
California.<p>
<p>
The INS estimates that the number of illegal aliens in the US is increasing by
about 300,000 annually, and by 125,000 per year in California.  This clearly
suggests that IRCA failed to stem illegal immigration.  If the INS numbers are
projected to the year 2000, there would be 5.8 million illegal aliens in the
US, about the same as in early 1987.  California would have 2.4 million illegal
aliens at the start of the next century.<p>
<p>
These illegal aliens are concentrated in a few states and counties.  The Big
Six states--California (1.4 million illegal aliens in October 1992), New York
(449,000), Texas (357,000), Florida (322,000),  Illinois (176,000), and New
Jersey (116,000)--include 85 percent of the illegal aliens in the US.  In
California, Los Angeles county has almost two-thirds of the state's illegal
aliens.<p>
<p>
These data are suggestive rather than definitive.  One of uncertainties in
making illegal alien estimates is that very little is known about SAWs, the 1.1
million mostly young Mexican men who became US immigrants because they did at
least 90 days of farmwork as illegal aliens in 1985-86.  The massive fraud in
this program--perhaps two of three persons approved did not satisfy the
program's requirements--encouraged new streams of aliens to head north, and the
growth of the false documents industry and labor contracting has enabled
illegal aliens to continue to find US jobs.  What remains unclear is how fast
SAWs and the "new-new" immigrants arriving are bringing their families to the
US.<p>
<p>
<u>Immigration and California Politics</u><p>
According to polls, the top four issues for California voters are the economy,
crime, immigration and education.   The state lost 550,000 jobs, mostly in
high-tech industries, over the past 3.5 years--so that relatively high-income
Americans moved out of California as poor immigrants moved in.  (Due in part to
moneys flowing into California after the January 17 earthquake, 164,000 jobs
were added in the first quarter of 1994, heralding a possible recovery).  There
is general agreement that the state government has a limited ability to restart
the economy on its own, and most candidates have already endorsed the "three
strikes" initiative that mandates life in prison for a third felony conviction
to deal with crime.  <p>
<p>
This leaves immigration and education. In both cases, California hopes for
federal dollars that can stimulate an economic revival.   Other states with
large illegal immigrant populations are feeling the same pressures.  A poll in
September 1993 found that 63 percent of New Yorkers (New York has 13 percent of
the US  population of illegal aliens),  want immigration reduced, but leading
politicians in the state are not discussing the issue.  Florida, with 10
percent of the US illegal alien population, sued for federal reimbursement, but
politicians there are not engaged in anti-immigrant political rhetoric, perhaps
because Cuban-American immigrants there vote.<p>
<p>
Wilson's request for federal reimbursement is supported by both Democrats and
Republicans in the State Legislature, although California commentators note
that:  1) some Democrats in the Legislature are "silent partners" in the sense
that they want federal reimbursement, but abhor the anti-immigrant rhetoric
unleashed by Wilson; and,  2) the state's 54-member Congressional delegation is
sharply divided over what to do about illegal immigration.  It includes some of
the most vehement open- and closed- border Congressional representatives.
Middle-of-the-road Democrats such as Senator Feinstein has been quoted as
saying that, "the day when America could be the welfare system for Mexico is
gone." <p>
<p>
With budget deficits looming, California voters are unwilling to approve tax
increases and the Legislature is unwilling to cut programs, federal
reimbursement seems like the easiest way to close the state's budget deficit.
California wants at least $1 billion of the $2.3 billion it is requesting, but
others are quick to point out that the California politicians demanding
reimbursement played leading roles in the immigration reforms that created
today's immigration dilemma.<p>
<p>
<u>Benefits and Costs</u><p>
There is a great deal of disagreement over the costs and benefits of immigrants
to the US and California.  Studies in the early 1980s in Texas and New York
concluded that the taxes paid by immigrants exceeded the cost of providing
public services to them, but that the federal government got the surplus of
taxes over expenditures, and local governments had deficits.  Los Angeles did a
study in 1992 that reinforced this conclusion.<p>
<p>
Donald Huddle of Rice University<b> </b>set the benchmark for today's debate
with a study that concluded that the legal and illegal immigrants who arrived
since 1970 cost the US $42.5 billion in 1992, and $18.1 billion in California.
According to Huddle, 7.2 million immigrants arrived legally and illegally in
California since 1970, and the state incurred costs of $23 billion to provide
them with services--half of the costs were for education and health care, and
one-sixth were due to the costs of providing services to US residents displaced
by these immigrants.<p>
<p>
As with all such studies, Huddle made assumptions about how many illegal aliens
there are, their usage of welfare and other public services, the taxes they
paid, and their indirect economic impacts.  Jeff Passel of the  Urban Institute
reviewed and revised Huddle's US estimates, and his calculations turned the $42
billion net <u>cost</u> into a $29 billion net <u>benefit</u>.  <p>
<p>
Most of the $70 billion difference between these studies arises from their
estimates of the taxes paid by immigrants--Huddle assumes that post-1970
immigrants paid $20 billion in taxes to all levels of government, and Passel
assumes they paid $70 billion.  And the major reason for the difference in tax
estimates is that Huddle did not include the 15 percent of each worker's
earnings that are paid in Social Security taxes, while Passel did--this
accounts for over one-third of the $70 billion difference.<p>
<p>
Huddle excluded Social Security taxes because, in his view, contributions today
need to be offset by the promise of benefit payments to immigrants when they
retire.  Passel included them  because the federal government treats Social
Security on a pay-as-you-go basis.<p>
<p>
<u>Next Steps</u><p>
<u></u>There was general agreement that "something" will be done about illegal
immigration in 1994, including some federal reimbursement to states and cities
to cover their cost of providing services to illegal aliens.  What is not clear
is whether federal action will stop with reimbursement of selected state and
local government costs, or whether the prospect of continuing illegal
immigration and continuing reimbursement will produce broader immigration
reforms.<p>
<p>
As Congress and the public re-debate what to do about illegal immigration, it
was noted that past "Grand Bargains"  between restrictionists and admissionists
have generally failed--the carrot and stick of sanctions and amnesty did not
stop illegal immigration.  Indeed, despite 200 years of experience with
immigration, the unanticipated consequences of US  immigration reforms continue
to have more lasting effects than their anticipated effects.<p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Jordan
on US Immigration Policy "Furor"</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Former Texas Congresswoman Barbara Jordan termed the current US
discussion of efforts to halt illegal immigration and reimburse states for the
costs they incur to provide services to such immigrants a "furor" rather than a
debate.  Jordan was appointed by President Clinton to chair the nine-member
Commission on Immigration Reform (CIR), which is scheduled to issue and interim
report that includes recommendations to deal with these issues in September
1994.<p>
<p>
According to Jordan, the CIR agrees that control efforts such as Operation Hold
the Line--massing US Border Patrol agents on the border to deter illegal
entries--must be strengthened, since border controls are the most humane way to
deal with illegal immigrants.  Second, there is a consensus that illegal
immigrants should not be entitled to social service benefits such as welfare,
and an improved identification system should not be ruled out in order to
ensure that unauthorized aliens do not obtain such benefits.  Jordan  is
sympathetic to the pleas of states for federal reimbursement of the costs they
incur to provide services to illegal entrants, but she thinks that their
requests for federal payments may have overstated immigrant costs and
understated their tax payments.  <p>
<p>
Third, in response to proposals for a "moratorium" on immigration, Jordan said
she is not opposed to today's level of immigration.  According to Jordan, the
US can and should improve opportunities for all American residents, natives and
legal immigrants alike.<p>
<p>
There are 150 pieces of immigration control legislation are pending in either
the House or the Senate, and they propose, inter alia, ditches along the
Mexican border; a tripling of the number of Border Patrol agents; and creating
a tamper-proof identification card.  However, some observers predict that
immigration reform legislation will not be enacted in 1994 because there have
been few hearings scheduled on these proposals.  Sen. Edward Kennedy, chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, is
reportedly afraid that <p>
holding hearings could lead to anti-immigrant legislation.<p>

<a name="RTFToC5">UFW
 Marches in California</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>United Farm Workers (UFW) supporters in April 1994 retraced the famous
1966 march that led to the union's first collective bargaining agreements.  In
a 335-mile trek from Delano to Sacramento, the UFW announced that it was
changing course, shifting its emphasis from urging consumers to boycott grapes
to organizing immigrant workers in California fields.<p>
<p>
The UFW was transformed by immigration.  The UFW won two 40 percent one-year
wage increases in the years that marked the era of low farmworker
immigration--in 1966, and again in 1980.  At its height in 1981, the UFW had
over 100 contracts, and 50,000 to 60,000 farmworkers worked under these
contracts during a typical year.  Today, the UFW has 20 to 30 contracts,
covering 5,000 to 6,000 workers. In areas such as the Salinas Valley south of
San Francisco, hourly wages are often lower today--$4.50 to $5.50--than they
were in the early 1980s--$5 to $7 (membership data are murky--some reports
speak of 100,000 members at peak and 15,000 today, but the UFW has never paid
dues to the AFL-CIO for so many members).<p>
<p>
Immigration and the rise of labor contractors contributed to the loss of UFW
contractors and members.  The UFW called several strikes in the early 1980s
that were broken by labor contractors who employed recently-arrived and
unauthorized workers.  The UFW hoped that, by legalizing farmworkers in
1987-88, it would win their loyalty, and that the expected end of illegal
immigration would enable the UFW to win wage increases.  Despite aggressive
efforts, the UFW and employer organizations assisted fewer than one in 12 SAW
applicants, and IRCA contributed to the increased immigration of illegal aliens
who found farm jobs with the help of labor contractors.<p>
<p>
The UFW continues to see growers, labor contractors, and what they believe to
be the pro-grower administration of California's farm labor law as the union's
chief obstacles, not illegal immigration.  Indeed, at a rally attended by
12,000 on April 24 in Sacramento to mark the end of the 23-day march, there
were more calls for another amnesty than for tightening border enforcement.
The march drew attention to the plight of California farmworkers, but put the
blame on growers and labor contractors rather than illegal immigration.<p>

<b></b>In 1985, the Population Reference Bureau published a monograph entitled
<u>Population Change and California's Future</u>, which projected that the
state's population would reach 50 million by 2020.  In April 1994, Census
projections reached the same conclusion--California may have 48 million people
by 2020--15 percent of the 326 million US population.  The Census projects that
there will be 20 million births in California, and that 10 million immigrants
will arrive in California between  1992 and 2020.  Four million residents are
expected to leave the state, and after subtracting deaths California will gain
an average 600,000 residents annually.<p>
<p>
There is also expected to be a dramatic change in the ethnic composition of the
state's population.  In 2020, Latinos are projected to  be 36 percent of the

<a name="RTFToC7">Aristide
to Cancel US Return Policy</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide notified the US
government that the agreement which allows Haitians sailing toward the US to be
intercepted and repatriated will be canceled in 6 months, i.e., on October 4,
1994.  Under the 13-year old agreement, Haiti allowed the US Coast Guard to
stop boats in Haitian and international waters to determine whether they were
carrying Haitians to the US; the US Coast Guard has intercepted and returned
66,000 Haitians since 1981.  <p>
<p>
Candidate Clinton criticized the US policy of intercepting and returning
Haitians sailing for the US during the 1992 campaign, but President Clinton
maintained the policy, saying he was saving Haitians from drowning at sea.  On
April 22, the Coast Guard brought 400 Haitian "boat people" to Florida, but
said that this was an "extraordinary circumstance," not a change in US policy.
In early April, the US Coast Guard, for the first time,  returned to the
Bahamas 19 Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute;s who were bound for the US.  Their return
came after the US was criticized over its handling of Haitians; previously,
most Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute;s were granted immediate political asylum. <p>
<p>
US policy toward Haitians came under attack in late April, as several US
Congressional representatives were arrested for protesting US policies.
According to US officials, US policies need only fine-tuning; some 55,000
Haitians inquired about US refugee status in Haiti, 15,000 applied and were
interviewed, and 3000 were recognized as US refugees and admitted to the
US.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
A former US ambassador to Haiti noted that, by canceling the return agreement,
Aristide is trying to exert pressure on the US Administration.  If the
agreement is in fact canceled, Haitians might be arriving on Florida beaches
just as President Clinton is meeting with Western Hemisphere leaders in Miami
in December.<p>
<p>
Aristide was elected with 67 percent of the vote in 1990, but was ousted in a
military coup seven months later.  Aristide is currently touring the US asking
for grassroots support to reverse the policy of returning Haitians.
Unemployment in Haiti is estimated to be 70 percent.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">Living
With NAFTA</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
Most of the US debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement in October
and November, 1993 centered on how free trade would affect American workers.
An April 8-9, 1994 conference at Yale University in New Haven, CT, turned the
spotlight on Mexico, asking how Mexicans are living with NAFTA after the two
C's in Mexico--Chiapas in January and Colosio in March 1994.<p>
<p>
When thousands of armed Indians took over several Chiapas cities in January
1994, they emphasized the fact that millions of  Mexicans, especially rural
residents, had been left behind in Mexico's recent growth spurt.  According to
those familiar with Chiapas, the 700,000 to one million non-Spanish-speaking
Indians in the Chiapas highlands became dependent on migrating to lowland
coffee-harvesting and corn-growing jobs in the 1970s--virtually all of the
120,000 adult men migrated seasonally to such jobs in the late 1970s.<p>
<p>
Cattle began to replace corn in Chiapas in the late 1970s, and many of the
Indians, displaced from migratory farm jobs, were employed in public works
projects after the 1979 run-up of oil prices.  But the debt crisis of 1982
ended these government jobs and, as Guatemalans poured into Chiapas to escape
fighting, Chiapas Indians lost coffee-picking jobs to them.  In 1989, coffee
prices fell by 50 percent, leaving a growing Indian population with ever-fewer
jobs and little hope.<p>
<p>
There was an upsurge of  conflict among the highland Indians which often
manifested itself as fights between Catholics and Protestants.  The cities
grew--San Cristobol's population rose from 30,000 in 1970 to over 100,000 in
1990.  According to some observers, it was no surprise that the Indians began a
violent protest; the surprise was that they tied the protest to NAFTA, and
showed considerable sophistication in dealing with the media.<p>
<p>
According to local observers, the Chiapas uprising has converted some
previously anti-NAFTA forces in southern Mexico into NAFTA supporters.  With no
future in corn or coffee growing, the Chiapas Indians need jobs.  Foreign
investment, spurred by NAFTA,  is likely to be the best way to get them.  <p>
<p>
There was considerable discussion of the Mexican government's treatment of the
Chiapas rebels.  According to human rights observers, there were three reasons
why the government did not use the heavy hand of the military to repress the
rebellion--there was a shrunken security presence in the area, almost 500
Mexican and national non-governmental organizations rushed into Chiapas, and
the international media arrived, so that military repression might have
threatened Mexico's image as a democracy open to foreign investors.  Human
rights observers expressed hope that the combination of the Chiapas uprising
and the March 23, 1994 assassination of PRI presidential candidate Colosio
would generate enough interest in the August 21, 1994 election that Mexican and
international pressures would lead to an honest election.<p>
<p>
According to several participants, Mexico has been pursuing its own version of
the "East Asian" development model--an authoritarian government that moves fast
on changing economic policies to produce rapid economic growth, but slow on
political changes that would promote democracy.  However, growth has recently
slowed--Mexico barely evaded a recession late in 1993, defined as two
consecutive quarters of a shrinking GDP--and the Mexican peso has slipped about
eight percent in 1994, to $US1=3.36 pesos in mid-April 1994.  <p>
<p>
Mexico's economy can be seen as a half-full or half-empty glass.  The Mexican
government expects Direct Foreign Investment (DFI) to increase by 24 percent in
1994 to $6.1 billion, from $4.6 billion in 1993.  But 85 percent of the foreign
investments in Mexico continue to pour into stocks and bonds; such funds can
exit the country quickly, as they have been doing in 1994 as a result of a 32
percent fall in the Bolsa (in US dollars). The Mexican government says that
$3.5 billion poured into stocks and bonds in the first quarter of 1994, while
one New York money manager estimates that $8 billion left Mexico.  <p>
<p>
Some experts express puzzlement at why DFI is not flowing into labor-intensive
manufacturing plants producing goods for export.  The explanations for the lack
of DFI range from uncertainty over the political situation until after the
August elections and September renegotiation of El Pacto--the government,
employer, and union agreement on wage increases--to Mexico's deficient
infrastructure. <p>
<p>
It is clear that at least some US and Canadian NAFTA opponents see the turmoil
in Mexico as vindication.  And there is no consensus on what may happen in
Mexico in 1994.  As one Mexican suggested, <u>anything</u> can happen in 1994.
There is a debate, for example, between those who want to reform the Mexican
union movement, so that it remains a key part of Mexican society, and some
"technocrats" and employers who prefer the largely non-union maquiladora model
that offers maximum labor market flexibility. (In Mexico, elections to
determine whether workers want to be represented by a union are sometimes not
by secret ballot, a practice that led to protests at a Sony plant in Nuevo
Laredo in April 1994.)  The foreign investors building plants in Mexico
allegedly want to hire young women who are just entering the workforce rather
than experienced (and perhaps unionized) workers who are losing their jobs in
downsizing and privatization.<p>
<p>
The first complaints under NAFTA's labor-side agreement were filed February 14
by two US unions on behalf of workers allegedly fired for union activities in
maquiladoras owned by Honeywell and GE.  Under the side agreement, there must
be a ruling on these complaints within 60 days, i.e., by April 14, 1994.
However, the tri-national labor commission, located in Dallas, is not yet fully
operational.<p>
<p>
Many Mexicans have used the two "C" events--Chiapas and Colosio-- to press the
government to help them.  In early April, thousands of people marched in Mexico
City to mark the anniversary of the death of revolutionary hero Emiliano
Zapata.  President Salinas distributed $10 million to farmers throughout
Mexico, and declared that the land reforms underway would "strengthen the
ejido."  Ernesto Zedillo, the new PRI presidential candidate, announced that
Mexico would not be able to maintain its economic progress unless democracy is
strengthened, a slogan that is to take concrete form in the establishment of
rules for the August 1994 election.<p>
<p>
The conference concluded on a question:  would NAFTA turn Mexico into a giant
maquiladora or into the high-tech economy that the Salinas technocrats want?
One somewhat surprising point of agreement was that virtually everyone in the
Mexican elite now supports NAFTA; the disagreement is over how to couple
economic change with political change.<p>

<a name="RTFToC9">Immigration
Fraud</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
A Hispanic civil rights leader was indicted on charges of running a $6 million
immigration fraud scheme that provided fake documents to illegal Asian and
Hispanic immigrants. <p>
<p>
Jose Velez, the president of the League of United Latin American Citizens
(LULAC) is alleged to have brought illegal immigrants to Las Vegas to file
false applications for amnesty under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control
Act Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) program. Velez and three Taiwanese
co-defendants are charged with conspiring to falsely claim in documents,
applications and statements to the Immigration and Naturalization Service that
their illegal clients qualified for amnesty because they did at least 90 days
of farmwork in 1985-86.  Velez's son and five others pleaded guilty on March
22, 1994 to helping to process 5,600 false applications for $5.7 million.
Individual aliens paid an average of $1,000 each for false documents (according
to the INS, the fees ranged from $250 to $3,500). <p>
<p>
The SAW program has been termed "the largest immigration fraud ever perpetrated
on the U.S. government."  This "easy" legalization program--created largely to
satisfy California growers that they would have a supply of labor after IRCA
made it unlawful to hire illegal aliens--was the last-minute compromise that
permitted IRCA to be enacted.  According to the best estimates, there should
have been fewer than 300,000 to 400,000 SAWs approved, but the INS approved 1.1
million, and set new streams of rural Mexicans and Central Americans heading
north.  As one result, already glutted farm labor markets got even more
workers,  farmers planted more apples and oranges, and labor contractors
emerged as "risk absorbers" to match unauthorized immigrant workers and
seasonal farm jobs. <p>

<a name="RTFToC11">France:
 Foreigners and Immigrants</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>There are 3.6 million foreigners and 4.2 million immigrants in
France--immigrants include foreigners (69 percent) and persons born abroad who
acquire French citizenship (about 100,000 annually).  About 55 percent of the
immigrants in France in 1990 were from European nations.  Foreigners are
persons born abroad (79 percent) and those born in France of non-French
parents.<p>
<p>
France has a complicated procedure for granting "easy" citizenship.  According
to the jus sanguinis principle, a child of French citizen parents is
automatically French, as in most countries.  In addition, France as a special
type of jus soli--a child born in France with one French parent has a right to
French citizenship if he/she so chooses before age 18.  Children born in France
of non-French parents who have lived in France for at least 5 years can request
citizenship between the ages of 16 and 21.<p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>The French right has often accused the government of understating
the number of immigrants.  There are 6.1 million residents of foreign origin,
including children with at least one non-French parent, and 20 percent of the
French population of 57 million has at least on foreign parent or
grandparent.<p>
<p>
<u>Immigration a Campaign Issue</u><p>
A campaign by the anti-Maastricht party, L'Autre Europe, is using the treaty's
promise of freedom of movement for citizens of non-EU nations who are permanent
immigrants in one EU nation as an argument against the EU.  L'Autre Europe says
that freedom of movement could lead to the  immigration of "socially and
politically unsustainable" e.g. Turks into France.<p>
<p>
<u>Pasqua Will Say No to Algerian Refugees</u> <p>
French Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua, said on April 18 that France would
refuse to accept any "wave" of refugees fleeing Algeria if Moslem
fundamentalists took power. According to Pasqua, the number of asylum requests
made to French authorities by Algerians rose from 104 in 1992 to over 1,000 in
1993. <p>

<a name="RTFToC12">Kohl
Calls for Expulsion of Violent Kurds</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called for the expulsion of Kurds who took part
in highway blockades and violent demonstrations on and after March 19 to
protest the Turkish government's treatment of Kurds in southeastern Turkey
(Kurds or "mountain Turks" are 10 to 15 million of Turkey's 60 million people).
Rudolf Scharping, the SPD candidate for Chancellor, backed the expulsion of
Kurds convicted of violent offenses. <p>
<p>
The German government is currently attempting to negotiate a deportation
agreement with Turkey.  The key sticking point is whether Kurds deported from
Germany to Turkey because of "threats to[German] public safety and order"  face
persecution there.  The German Interior Minister has asked Turkey to guarantee
that deported Kurds will not be tortured or executed. <p>
<p>
Kurds are one-fifth of the two million Turks in Germany, and an estimated one
percent of the 400,000 Kurds in Germany are members of the PKK, a group seeking
an independent country in southeastern Turkey, northeastern Iraq, and western
Iran for the region's 20 to 30 million Kurds.  The PKK was banned in Germany in
February, 1993.  <p>
<p>
<u>Asylum</u><p>
Germany is a reluctant land of immigration--most of the 6.5 million non-German
citizens in the country were not anticipated.  During the 1960s and early
1970s, Germany recruited "guestworkers" who were expected to work one or two
years and return home with their savings.  Instead, many Turkish guestworkers
settled. Originally imported to add only workers to the workforce, today the
Turks contribute proportionally fewer workers to the German workforce than do
Germans.<b> </b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>During the late 1980s, foreigners began to take advantage of Germany's
constitutional guarantee that "all persons suffering political persecution
shall have the right of asylum."  During the three- to five-year application
and appeal process, asylum seekers were housed and fed at local government
expense and, in some areas, they obtained permission to work. In 1992, over
430,000 foreigners applied for asylum--which fewer than five percent
received.<p>
<p>
Beginning July 1, 1993, Germany began refusing to accept applications from
persons who arrived via "safe" countries in which they could have applied for
asylum.  As a result, the number of asylum applications during the first
quarter of 1994 fell by two-thirds versus the first quarter of 1993, to an
average of 12,000 per month. About one-third of the first quarter's 36,000
asylum applicants were from the former Yugoslavia, and one-eighth were from
Turkey.<p>
<p>
<u>Unions on Integration</u><p>
A Confederation of German Trade Unions (DGB) position paper, adopted on
November 9, 1993, urges the German government to recognize that "Germany will
certainly need migrants" but that immigration must "be structured and
organized."  This can be achieved with annual quotas on immigration that do not
discriminate on the basis of, inter alia, country of origin and, once the
immigrants arrive in Germany, they must be integrated in a process that
involves mutual adaptation and respect.  <p>
<p>
The DGB has a number of specific suggestions for the immigration policy it
wants Germany to adopt.  For example, it wants permanent immigrant status
granted after five years of residence, and wants permanent immigrants to be
allowed to vote in local elections.  Foreign workers should be employed on an
equal basis with German workers, and this means, according to the unions, that
so-called contract work in construction must be banned.  Eastern European
contract workers are often brought to Germany as employees of a firm that wins
a subcontract to complete part of a construction project in Germany.<p>

of November 1993, the Zentoitsu Workers Union, which represents workers in

in Japan if they are unemployed; when they are laid off, they are required to
leave.<p>

Young  foreign professionals in Japan are satisfied with their jobs, but
pessimistic about their chances for advancement, according to a recent survey.
The Kaisha Society is a group of young foreign men who are usually hired as
shokutaku, or contract workers, rather than as seishain, or regular staff.
Many Japanese firms do not invest in training these foreigners because they do
not expect them to stay with the firm; just one percent of those surveyed
expect to be with their current employer in 10 years.  Most of these young
foreign professionals came to Japan because jobs were immediately available and

The Taiwanese Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has identified six major problems
associated with the foreign workers that have been brought into the country
over the past four and one-half years.  The CLA noted that foreign workers have
eased the labor shortage, accelerated the completion of major infrastructure
projects, and improved relations with emigration nations.  <p>
<p>
However, the CLA noted that there has been an inconsistent administration of
Taiwan's foreign worker polices, labor disputes between foreign workers and
their employers, and violations of rules by workers, labor brokers, and
employers.<p>
<p>
Since October 1989, the CLA has approved employer applications for 170,351
foreign workers.  Some 84,724--two-thirds of them Thais--are in Taiwan.
Foreign workers are admitted on one-year work permits, and may extend their
stay one more year.  Many of the foreign construction workers have two-year
work permits that expire in April 1994, and fears of labor shortages reportedly
led to the shift from two-to three-year maximum stays.  In March, Taiwan
announced that foreigners may not be more than 65 percent of the labor force on
major construction projects.<p>
<p>
In a related development, the Philippines announced in April that Taiwan labor
agents recruiting Filipino workers will need to be accredited by the Department
of Labor and Employment and have their commissions regulated.  Filipinos have
complained that these brokers fees can range from 38,000 to 65,000 pesos ($US
1,400 to $2,400), with the broker pocketing half or more of this commission.

Maids in Malaysia</a>

On Palm Sunday (March 27, 1994), Malaysian authorities detained 1,200 Filipina
maids inside and outside St. John's Church in Kuala Lumpur.  The Philippines
complained that Christian maids were being harassed by Malaysia's
Muslim-majority government; only 21 of the maids proved to be illegal aliens
(38 according to Malaysian authorities). <p>
<p>
Some in the Philippines urged the government to protest this "roundup" by
suspending the migration of Filipino workers to labor-short Malaysia.  However,
Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Megat Junit Megat Ayub said that even though
Filipinos were preferred as migrant workers in the spirit of ASEAN cooperation
(and because they speak English), Malaysia could and would recruit foreign
workers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China.  <p>
<p>
Malaysian authorities said that the purpose of the raid was to ensure that the
maids were not engaged in illegal activities during their Sunday day off.  More
than 10,000 illegal aliens have been detained since labor recruitment was
stopped and an effort was made to locate and expel illegal aliens in January
1994.  About 5000 remain in detention camps, and Malaysian employers who had
received approval to hire foreign workers before the freeze was announced can
hire aliens in detention.<p>
<p>
In the Philippines, economic growth rose to 2.3 percent in 1993, "largely
because of a 7.6 percent increase to $2.1 billion in remittances,"  making

<a name="RTFToC25">Malaysia
Grapples with Labor Shortages</a>
</a></h2>
<p>
The Manpower Department's January 1994 Employment Trend report reviewed labor
market trends in 1993 and noted that employers were adopting a variety of
strategies to cope with labor shortages in an economy with a three percent
unemployment, including offering bounties to current workers who bring in new
workers, beginning to hire male production operatives, adjusting work hours
(such as adding a 5 to 11 PM shift), and raising fringe benefits more than
wages to make workers loyal to one employer.  Some 600,000 production workers
in manufacturing got wage increases that averaged 4.6 percent in 1993, down
from 8.7 percent in 1992, a decrease attributed to the availability of foreign
workers.<p>
<p>
The daily wages of production workers reached RM 9 to 14 ($3.30 to $5.20), and
fringe benefits add RM80 to 150 ($30 to $55) per month to average monthly
earnings of $102.  According to the report, industries offering
lower-than-average wages and unfavorable working conditions, including
agriculture and construction, face the most severe labor shortages.  The <u>Los
Angeles Times</u> reported that average daily labor costs were $6.50 in
Malaysia in 1993, versus $1.50 in neighboring Indonesia.<p>
<p>
According to government calculations, foreign investors have listened to
urgings to bring more capital-intensive projects to Malaysia.  In 1989, each RM
1 million in foreign investment created 14 new jobs, implying RM71,400 per
job($26,444).  By 1993, the ratio had fallen to seven, raising the investment
to RM143,000 per job($52,963).<p>
<p>
Foreign workers dominate the workforces of Malaysia's two eastern
semi-autonomous provinces, Sabah and Sarawak.  Daily wages in Sabah, which
reportedly ranged from  RM7 to RM12 for production workers, RM10 to RM20 for
construction workers, and RM7 to RM15 for agricultural workers, were kept
stable in 1993 by the ready availability of mostly illegal Filipino workers.
However, the Sabah state government nonetheless arranged for 1,688 workers to
move to Peninsular Malaysia to fill vacant jobs there. <p>
<p>
Most of the estimated 1.2 million foreign workers in Malaysia are Indonesians,
followed by Filipinos (335,000 are legal workers), Bangladeshis, and Thais.
The Indonesian Manpower Minister announced that Indonesia was going to
establish training centers to train workers seeking jobs in Malaysia,
ostensibly to help Malaysia to overcome its labor shortages.  Indonesia also
announced plans to step up efforts to prevent illegal migration to  Malaysia.

China has an estimated 100 million migrant workers, including eight million in

<p>
Inflation and 'sweatshop' conditions have led workers in some instances to
establish independent trade unions.  Fearing that such unions could become a

Workers in South Korea</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>There are an estimated 150,000  foreigners working in small-and
medium-size companies in South  Korea.  These mostly illegal workers face
penalties of up to 1.5 million<p>
won ($1,875), and this allegedly makes them subject to employer abuse--one
foreign worker assistance center in Seoul received 3,000 reports of foreign
worker abuse in 1993, one-third of which involved wage disputes.  There are
also 18,000 legally employed foreigners who are classified as technical
trainees.  <p>
<p>
South Korea has announced that all foreign workers--legal and illegal--are to
leave the country by June 1994.  A new guestworker program, operated by the
Korea Federation of Small Business, will bring in 20,000 Asian workers on
technical trainee visas.  The hope is that, with employers directly contracting
with foreign workers and offering them two year contracts, abuse by labor
brokers will be minimized.<p>

illegal foreign workers injured on the job.<p>

More than 4,000 employers paid the  $500 HK to apply for the Chinese

Recruits Guestworkers</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>The Israeli government on April 10, 1994 announced that 18,000
additional work permits would be made available so that Israeli employers can
employ foreign workers  to replace Palestinians who were barred after April 7
from entering Israel.  There are 6,000 guestworkers from Thailand, Turkey,
Romania and other Eastern European countries in Israel, and permission to
recruit 7,000 more was granted in March 1994.  After all of these guestworkers
arrive, Israel will have 33,000 non-Palestinian foreign workers.<p>
<p>
There are two million Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza (excluding
the 150,000 in East Jerusalem).  Earnings from jobs in Israel account for an
estimated one-third of the GDP of the West Bank and Gaza, so that it costs
Palestinians $4 million in lost wages each day they are barred from Israel.
Almost 80 percent of the Palestinians who work in Israel are employed in
construction and agriculture.  However, of the 107,000 unemployed Israeli
workers, only 1,400 have indicated a willingness to do farmwork.  <p>
<p>
Initial indications are that 15,000 of the additional foreign workers will be
for the construction sector, which claims to be short 60,000 workers, and 3,000
are for agriculture.  The Israeli government has tried to avoid having foreign
workers do Israel's "dirty work," and there is concern that substituting
non-Palestinians for Palestinians will aggravate frustration in the West Bank
and Gaza, where unemployment runs 54 percent.  Israelis seem to support
restrictions on Palestinians workers because of terrorist activities.<p>
<p>
When Israel began to restrict their entry in March 1993, there were about
100,000 Palestinians employed in Israel.<p>

and Labor Migration</a>
</a></h2>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations that began in September 1986
ended on April 15 with the creation of a new organization, the World Trade
Organization, to regulate trade between nations.  France and the US led a drive
to insist that the WTO address the issue of "social dumping," the notion that
trade agreements should include clauses that require trading partners to
observe at least minimum worker rights if they want to export their goods.  <p>
<p>
Asian nations led the fight against the WTO taking up the worker rights issue.
They argued that the industrial countries wanted to drive up their labor costs,
thus making their exports less competitive.  When the industrial nations
insisted on linking trade and labor standards, Asian nations demanded that the
WTO also take up the relationship between trade and migration.<p>
<p>
The compromise was to include both the relationship between the trading system
and internationally recognized labor standards and the relationship between
immigration policies and international trade as "critical issues" to be
addressed by the WTO.<p>

CGES-CIIP Working Paper 1, Available for $5 from CGES at 254 Moses Hall, UCB,
Berkeley, CA 94720.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>This paper summarizes the facts about migration-for-employment, reviews
the reasons why people migrate for economic reasons, and outlines the research
agenda.<p>
<p>
There are about 100 million persons living and working outside their countries
of origin, they remit at least $75 billion annually to their countries of
origin, and the three factors that regulate economically-motivated migration
are evolving in ways that promise more rather than less in the 1990s.  Too
little is known about the relative importance of demand-pull, supply-push, and
network factors in particular migration flows, and how the relative importance
of each of these factors changes over time.<p>

Place of Migration.</u>  Available from International Labor Office, CH-1211
Geneva 22.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>This eight-chapter book explores an overlooked question:  could foreign
aid that was targeted and structured reduce the need for migrants to leave
their countries of citizenship as migrant workers and refugees?  The
International Labour Office and United Nations High Commission on Refugees
commissioned papers that were presented at a May 1992 conference, and this
volume is an edited selection of the papers presented.<p>
<p>
There are four ways in which rich industrial countries can affect
emigration-increasing pressures in developing nations:  trade policy, foreign
direct investment, promoting political freedom, and Official Development
Assistance (ODA).  Only ODA is directly under the control of donor governments,
and the major conclusion of the refugee papers is that the traditional two R's
of refugee assistance--relief and resettlement--must be expanded to four R's,
with the addition of repatriation and addressing the root causes.  <p>
<p>
Reducing economically-motivated emigration requires industrial countries to
shift from discussing trade <u>or</u> aid to trade <u>and</u> aid.  Industrial
countries are often hypocritical when they complain that their ODA is not
effective in reducing emigration pressures, even as they erect barriers to the
goods produced by emigration countries.<p>

Leon Bouvier and David Simcox published a study that finds that Asian
professionals born outside the United States have a higher median salary than
any US professional group. The highest median income is for South Korean-born
physicians who earn $101,000 annually, followed by Indian-born doctors at
$82,205. The study also found that although there were three times as many
black professionals as foreign-born Asian professionals, 14,000 Asian
professionals made more than $150,000 per year, while fewer than 4,000 blacks
did.<p>
<p>
The U.S. has 15.1 million native-born professionals and 1.3 million
foreign-born professionals, according to the 1990 Census.  If current trends
continue, a three-tiered professional labor market could develop, with Asians
having the highest earnings, whites in the middle, and Blacks and Hispanics the
lowest earnings. <p>
<p>
The Census Bureau has just released data on 110 racial and ethnic groups, and
they range in size from 30,085 Indonesians in 1990 to 45 million German-origin
residents.  More than half of the Egyptians, Iranians, Nigerians, Taiwanese,
and Pakistanis had at least college degrees.<p>

<b><u>Asian Migrant</u>'s January-March 1994 </b>issue is devoted to Filipino

workers sent abroad legally in 1993 went to Asian nations, many as maids. <p>
