<h2 align=center>Position Paper of the<br>
Learning Disabilities Association of America</h2>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">LDA's position paper on full inclusion of all
students with learning disabilities in the regular education classroom,
1993</font></b></p>

<p>The Learning Disabilities Association of America, LDA, is a National,
not-for-profit organization of parents, professionals, and persons with
learning disabilities, concerned about the welfare of individuals with
learning disabilities. During the 1990-1991 school year 2,117,087 children
in public schools were identified as having learning disabilities. This
is more than fifty percent of the total number of students identified in
all disability categories. </p>

<p>&quot;Full inclusion&quot;, &quot;full integration&quot;, &quot;unified
system&quot;, &quot;inclusive education&quot; are terms used to describe
a popular policy/practice in which all students with disabilities, regardless
of the nature or severity and need for related services, receive their
total education within the regular classroom in their home school. </p>

<p>The Learning Disabilities Association of America does not support &quot;full
inclusion&quot; or any policies that mandate the same placement, instruction,
or treatment for <b>all</b> students with learning disabilities. Many students
with learning disabilities benefit from being served in the regular classroom.
However the regular education classrom is not the appropriate placement
for a number of students with learning disabilities who may need alternative
instructional environments, teaching strategies, and/or materials that
cannot or will not be provided within the context of a regular classroom
environment. </p>

<p>LDA believes that decisions regarding educational placement of students
with learning disabilities must be based on the needs of each individual
student rather than administrative convenience or budgetary considerations,
and must be the result of a cooperative effort involving educators, parents,
and the student, when appropriate. </p>

<p>LDA strongly supports the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA) which mandates: </p>

<ul>
<li>a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment
appropriate for the student's specific learning needs. </li>

<li>a team-approved individualized education program (IEP) that includes
current functioning levels, instructional goals and objectives, placement
and services decisions, and procecures for the evaluation of program effectiveness.
</li>

<li>a placement decision must be made on an individual basis and considered
only after the development of the IEP. </li>

<li>a continuum of alternative placements to meet the need of students
with disabilities for special education and related services </li>

<li>a system for the continuing education of regular and special education
and related services personnel to enable these personnel to meet the needs
of persons with disabilities. </li>
</ul>

<p>LDA believes that the placement of <b>all</b> children with disabilities
in the regular classroom is as great a violation of IDEA as the placement
of all children in separate classrooms on the basis of their type of disability.
</p>

<p><b>LDA urges the U.S. Department of Education and each state to move
deliberately and reflectively in school restructuring, using the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act as a foundation-- mindful of the best interests
of all children with disabilities.</b> </p>
