<h4><font color="#000080">Anti-stigma Poster Makes A Difference</font></h4>
<p>
by Stephanie Naso, NAMI intern
<P>
	The stigma surrounding people with brain disorders is painful 
and frustrating and all too evident in our daily lives.  NAMI and 
other advocacy organizations constantly struggle to end the shame 
felt by those of us who have brain disorders.  One of NAMI's most 
popular stigma-busting tools is our "People with Mental Illness 
Enrich Our Lives" poster, which features names of famous artists 
and academia who have had brain disorders and have also made an 
impression on all of our lives.  
	<P>
Mitch Vesaas is the director of Tellurian/UCAN, an agency in Dane 
County, Wisconsin, that serves people who have brain disorders and 
problems with substance abuse and are oftentimes homeless.  He said 
that last year Tellurian bought several of NAMI's "People with 
Mental Illness Enrich Our Lives" posters and hung them throughout 
their group homes and shelters with the hope that residents would 
appreciate the message that they are not alone in their struggle 
and their brain disorder does not diminish their self-worth.  
<P>
	Within days, the names on the posters began to grow.  The 
residents had signed their own names to the list of famous people 
with brain disorders who have contributed to our society.  They, 
<P>
too, have something valuable to offer and wanted it to be 
recognized.  Tellurian not only framed the posters with the 
additional names, but arranged to have a billboard with a new, 
added-names poster and local AMI information erected in Madison, 
Wisconsin, during Mental Illness Awareness Week.
	<P>
NAMI was thrilled to learn about this positive action in our 
struggle against discrimination.  Stories like this one encourage 
us all to keep fighting for the rights of people with brain 
disorders.
  <P>
   Note:  To inquire about a copy of the original poster, call NAMI 
at 703/524-7600 and ask for the Resource and Distribution 
Department.  Posters are $3, plus shipping and tax, where 
applicable.
