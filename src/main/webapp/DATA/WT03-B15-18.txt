<P>
NetShade is fairly easy to operate, but because it operates invisibly, it
is not
always obvious how your network data is being protected.  To help explain
how
this application works, we have developed a series of case studies that
demonstrate how NetShade establishes secure sessions in a simple network
environment.
<P>
If you are more interested in how NetShade handles RSA keypair exchange,
insecure
session requests and multiple encryption algorithms, or how NetShade could
be
installed on a LAN, WAN or Apple Remote Access (ARA) environment, consult
the
document titled <A href="advanced.html">Advanced NetShade Operation</A>.

<H2><A name="case1">Case 1: An Insecure Network</A>
</H2><P>Figure 1 illustrates an extremely simple network with just three
users: Alice,
Bob and Trent.  Whenever one of these users wants to send private data to
another
user over the network, they are faced with a problem: the way the network
is
constructed means that the data will be sent to <B>all</B> the users on the
network.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="11.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
This means that normally, if Alice was sending network data (e-mail, shared
files, etc.) to Bob, Trent's machine would also receive the data, but would
then
discard it after recognizing that the data was intended for Bob.  But using
a
common network utility called a <B>protocol analyzer</B>, Trent can capture
and
record the data before his machine discards it.  This method of network
eavesdropping is essentially undetectable, so Alice and Bob might never know
that
Trent has been reading their private correspondence.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=90% SIZE=4>
<H2><A name="case2">Case 2: Two NetShade Users</A>
</H2><P>NetShade keeps private data out of eavesdroppers' hands by
<B>encrypting</B> it,
making it incomprehensible to anyone who doesn't know how to unscramble the
data.
 Whenever a network connection between two NetShade users is established,
NetShade encrypts everything sent between those two machines, creating a
<B>sealed session.</B>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="12.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
In Figure 2, Alice has established a sealed session with Bob.  Now, when
Trent
tries to eavesdrop on Alice and Bob's network messages, all he will see is
a
stream of white noise.

<H2><A name="case3">Case 3: Adding a Fourth User</A>
</H2><P>The network environment gets a little more complex when you add a
fourth network
entity -- another user, a file server, etc. -- as shown in Figure 3.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="13.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
As we mentioned in the previous case, NetShade can only set up secure
sessions between NetShade users.  So if someone else's machine is not protected,
all the data sent between your machine and that machine will be vulnerable
to
eavesdropping attacks.  In Figure 3, Bob has currently established a sealed
session with Alice, and is also connected to Carol.  But since Carol is not
running NetShade, Trent will be able to intercept all the data sent between
Carol
and Bob.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG src="14.GIF"></CENTER>
<P>
Installing NetShade on Carol's machine corrects this problem (see Figure
4). 
Now, Bob can establish secure connections with Alice and Carol simultaneously,
protecting all of his network messages from Trent's eavesdropping attacks.
Moreover, since each sealed session is protected with a unique key, Alice
will be
unable to eavesdrop on Bob's connection with Carol, even though she is running
NetShade and is connected to Bob.  By the same token, Bob will be unable
to
eavesdrop on Alice's connection with Carol.
<P>
Because Trent is not running NetShade, all of his network data will be vulnerable
to eavesdropping, even if he is connected to someone who is running NetShade.
Everyone else on the network, however, will be able to share their private
data
without fear of being overheard.  (Note: If Alice or Bob would rather not
allow
Trent to connect with their machines over an insecure medium, NetShade can
also
be configured to reject all insecure connections.  This feature is described
in
more detail in the document titled <A href="advanced.html">Advanced NetShade
Operation.</A>)
