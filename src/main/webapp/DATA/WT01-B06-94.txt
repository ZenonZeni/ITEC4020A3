<P>A relatively young city, only receiving City status as recently as
1925, Stoke-on-Trent is renowned for the design and manufacture of world 
class products. Home to 250,000 people and the world's foremost ceramic 
manufacturers, Stoke-on-Trent is a unique city made up of six separate 
towns - Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton - 
affectionately known as The Potteries.</P>

<P>Resources on and under the very ground of Stoke-on-Trent have shaped its
industrial development - clay, coal and ironstone form the backbone of the
area's economy. The name of Stoke-on-Trent will forever be associated with
world-class ceramic products. Indeed, with names such as Wedgwood, Spode and
Royal Doulton it's not surprising that other local business activities may be
overlooked. This association with ceramics disguises the real depth of the
City's economic character - Michelin, the world's leading tyre manufacturer, is
just one major company which has made Stoke-on-Trent its UK manufacturing
headquarters.</P>
