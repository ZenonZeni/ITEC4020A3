IN FACE OF MSHA CIVIL PENALTIES, FINES
J&T COAL CO. FILES FOR CHAPTER 7

     A Lee County, Va. coal company faced with more
than $320,000 in civil penalties, and even more in
potential criminal fines from a fatal roof fall, has
filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in federal court.
     J&T Coal cited a lack of assets for its filing.
J&T's deep mine in St. Charles, Va. was the site of a
massive roof fall that left four workers dead (MRR
3/1/91, p. 85).
     Earlier this spring J&T was convicted in U.S.
District Court on six criminal counts in connection
with the fatal accident (MRR 3/26). That ruling
could increase the cost to the company anywhere
from $600,000 to $3 million in additional fines.
     The bankruptcy filing could complicate
government efforts to collect the fines.
     Also U.S. District Judge Samuel Wilson has
refused to back off an 18-month prison sentence for
mine superintendent Garry Williams. Williams'
lawyers had asked to delay formal entry of judgment
for 30 days, so they could file a motion for
reconsideration of the sentence.
     Defense lawyers had earlier agreed to a lighter
sentence endorsed by federal prosecutors, but the
federal judge is not bound to adhere by such plea
agreements.
     Wilson had issued the tougher sentence after
reading an MSHA letter regarding unpaid safety
fines from operations Williams had run in the past.
Williams' lawyers still have until June 19 to appeal
the sentence, officials said.
     Wilson stood by his sentence during court
proceedings June 9.

PAYMENTS REQUIRED UNDER NEW FUNDS LAW ARE 'TAXES,'
HAVE BANKRUPTCY PRIORITY

     The recently enacted Coal Industry Retiree Health
Benefit Act, which imposes costs on coal mining
companies in order to stabilize the UMW retiree
health funds, applies to a company in Chapter 11
reorganization proceedings.
     The U.S District Court for the Southern District
of New York rejected LTV Steel Co.'s argument that
the new funds law does not apply to it. The court
also held that required contributions are "taxes"
entitled to first priority under the Bankruptcy Code,
and the obligations imposed by the new law should
be given first priority in LTV's bankruptcy
proceeding (MRR Document No. 0529).
     LTV Steel was a signatory to several industry-
wide wage agreements, which were the product of
multi-employer bargaining by the Bituminous Coal
Operators Assn. with the UMW. LTV filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1986 and sought
to terminate health benefits to retirees.
     In 1991, LTV won a court battle when a federal
appeals court held it was not required to provide
retiree benefits after January 1988 when the 1984
wage agreement expired. However, the new funds
law enacted in late 1992 makes all companies that
once signed any wage agreement with the UMW
liable for perpetually funding the retiree health care
system on a per-head basis. Under the new law,
contributions are paid to the UMW Combined Fund
which in turn provides benefits to retirees.
     LTV is now preparing to emerge from Chapter 11
and has scheduled a confirmation hearing on a plan
that does not provide for payments under the new
funds law, which LTV claims will be at least $12
million annually.
     LTV argued that any claim the Combined Fund
has against it is a "pre-petition claim" and barred
because it was not filed on time. However, the court
ruled the Combined Fund did not have a "claim"
before LTV's bankruptcy petition was filed because
any claim "simply did not exist" until the funds law
was enacted in 1992.
     The court also agreed with the Combined Fund
that contributions required by the new law are
"taxes" imposed by the federal government and,
therefore, are administrative expenses entitled to first
priority under the Bankruptcy Code. "Coal Act
obligations are appropriately described as 'taxes' due
to their overwhelmingly involuntary nature, their
explicitly stated public purpose and their obvious
potential to be imposed pursuant to the taxing
power," the court said.
     The court added that LTV's charges under the
new law are a "direct consequence of its continued
corporate existence," noting the law only imposes
obligations on signatories which are still "in
business," and are therefore best classified as
"administrative expenses."
     LTV and other companies have also attacked the
new funds law on constitutional grounds (MRR 2/12,
p. 56; 4/9, p. 167).

PARTNERSHIP MAY STILL BE LIABLE FOR
INCOAL'S WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY

     A partnership under "common control" with
Incoal Inc. may still be liable for Incoal's $810,610
withdrawal liability to UMW pension plans after a
recent federal appeals court decision.
     The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit ruled the lower court erred in
letting Double A Farms off the hook based on its
finding that there was no economic connection
between the two entities.
     The D.C. Circuit stressed it is not necessary to
find an economic connection in order to establish
that an enterprise is a "trade or business" under
common control with an employer and liable for its
unpaid withdrawal liability (MRR Document No. 0525).
     The court refused to decide the merits of the issue
and sent the case back to the U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia to rethink its finding that
Double A Farms was not a "trade or business."
     However, the D.C. Circuit said it was inclined to
side with the trustees of the UMW pension plans
who sued Double A Farms to collect Incoal's unpaid
withdrawal liability.

Incoal conceded liability

     Incoal, owned by the Adkins family, went out of
business in 1985 and conceded withdrawal liability
to the pension plans under the Employment
Retirement Income Security Act. The Adkins family
established Double A Farms in 1979 after acquiring
several hundred acres of land in Kentucky, and the
family claimed it bought the land for recreational and
investment purposes.
     Under ERISA, when an employer incurs
withdrawal liability, a "trade or business" under
"common control" is also responsible for paying the
withdrawal liability to the pension plans. The district
court ruled that Double A Farms was not a "trade or
business" under ERISA because there was no
economic connection with Incoal (MRR 2/14/92, p.
62).
     Reversing the lower court on this issue, the D.C.
Circuit said any inquiry into an economic connection
between the two enterprises is "irrelevant" in
determining whether Double A Farms is a "trade or
business" under ERISA.
     The appeals court sent the case back to the district
court to "find the facts" on this issue. However, the
appeals court set forth several guidelines and pointed
to a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court decision interpreting a
similar "trade or business" provision of the Internal
Revenue Code.
     The Supreme Court said the "primary purpose for
engaging in the activity must be for income or profit"
and that there must be "continuity and regularity" of
involvement.
     The D.C. Circuit said these factors appear to be
fulfilled in this case, noting Double A Farms
reported tobacco and cattle sales for at least seven
consecutive years.
     The court added it is not dispositive that the land
is used partly for recreational purposes and warned
the lower court not to base its findings on the
family's "self-serving" statement that they did not
intend to start a trade or business.
     Connors v. Incoal Inc., CA DC, No. 92-7023,
6/4/93.

FOURTH CIRCUIT DENIES BENEFITS TO
WIDOWS IN TWO SEPARATE CASES

     In two separate cases, the 4th U.S. Court of
Appeals denied benefits to widows seeking
survivors' benefits under the Black Lung Benefits
Act.
     In a decision issued June 2, the court found that
substantial evidence supported an ALJ's decision that
Bramble Grizzle died from lung cancer and that
pneumoconiosis was not a substantially contributing
cause or factor leading to his death.
     Grizzle worked in coal mines for 35 years before
his retirement and subsequent death in 1983. The
ALJ found that Grizzle had pneumoconiosis to some
degree at the time of his death, that he also suffered
from severe emphysema and heart disease, and that
the direct cause of his death was a pulmonary
hemorrhage caused by lung cancer.
     Grizzle's widow presented the testimony of the
miner's personal physician that black lung disease
weakened his heart and lowered his resistance so that
he could not withstand bleeding caused by his
cancer. Grizzle's physician added that
pneumoconiosis caused the miner's emphysema and
heart problems and may also have caused his lung
cancer.
     However, the ALJ relied on the reports of two
other physicians who stated that the miner was
totally disabled by emphysema caused by cigarette
smoking; that his lung cancer was also caused by
smoking, not by his black lung disease, and that he
had only a mild case of pneumoconiosis.
     The ALJ found that Grizzle's pneumoconiosis
was not a substantially contributing or a
complicating factor in his death under 20 CFR
718.205(c)(2) and he denied his widow's claim.

Widow urged use of 'true doubt rule'

     Appealing to the 4th Circuit, Grizzle's widow
argued that her physician's diagnoses raised at least
some doubt that black lung disease substantially
contributed to her husband's death and that she was
entitled to the benefit of the "true doubt rule."
     However, the court, while affirming the use of the
"true doubt rule" in limited situations, refused to
apply it to the widow's claim, noting the ALJ clearly
found the opinions of the employer's doctors far
more persuasive than the contrary view of Grizzle's
physician.
     The court also rejected her argument that a
treating physician's opinion is entitled to greater
weight than the reports of non-treating doctors.
     One judge dissented, stating the case should be
remanded in light of the recent 4th Circuit decision
in Shuff v. Cedar Coal Co., in which the court held
that pneumoconiosis is a "substantially contributing
cause" of death if it hastened the miner's death in any
way (MRR 7/17/92, p. 337).
     In an unrelated decision issued May 26, the 4th
Circuit ruled that Eula B. Lester failed to show her
husband had suffered from complicated
pneumoconiosis. Under Sect. 921(c)(3) such a
showing entitles a claimant to an irrebuttable
presumption that pneumoconiosis caused death or
disability (MRR Document No. 0521).
     The widow relied on a conforming chest X-ray
reading, but the court noted that all the other medical
evidence, including biopsy and autopsy results,
showed that, at most, her husband suffered from
simple pneumoconiosis.

PYRO FOREMEN HIT WITH $2,000 FINES;
MUST PAY FOR PROBATION SUPERVISION

     Four Pyro foremen received $2,000 fines and
three must pay for their supervision costs for their
role in conditions leading to the methane explosion
that killed 10 miners in September 1989.
     Despite the differing number of counts against
each man, they each paid the same $2,000 fine, and
three paid supervision costs of $1,383. All four also
paid a special assessment.
     An information filed March 10 against three of
the foremen charged them with violating 30 CFR
75.324 and 75.1802 for knowingly and willfully
stating in the preshift, onshift and daily report book
that no hazardous conditions had been observed by
or reported to them, when in fact methane was in
excess of 2% and had caused equipment to
deenergize.
     Chris Johnson, 33, of Nebo, Ky., was sentenced
on June 1 to one year of probation and a special
assessment of $125.
     The information on Johnson said that on five
occasions, March 31, 1989, April 1, 1989, May 11,
1989, June 22, 1989 and Sept. 11, 1989, methane
was reported to and observed by Johnson, in
concentrations at or above 2% in the working
section, and that mining equipment had been de-
energized from the methane.
     Perry Ray, 36, from Clay, Ky., was also
sentenced June 1 and must pay the fine, supervision
costs and a $25 special assessment for not reporting
methane problems. He was a foreman on a
continuous mining unit when methane had been
above 2% and equipment had de-energized on May
12, 1989.
     Eddie Frank Barber, 36, of Earlington, Ky., was
fined and put on probation for one year for not
reporting methane conditions on July 14 and July 22,
1989. Barber had to pay a special assessment of $50.
     These three foremen had to pay $1,383.60 for the
costs of their supervision.
     The fourth foreman, Gary Johnson, 39, of
Mortons Gap, Ky., was sentenced to four months of
home confinement as part of a one-year probation
term. He had to pay a special assessment of $150.
     Gary Johnson was charged in a six-count
information with violating:

     -- 30 CFR 75.324, for failing to report high
        concentrations of methane.
     -- 75.1315(a), for firing shots outside the confines
        of a borehole.
     -- 75.1313(b), for ordering the improper storage
        of explosives.
     -- 75.1310(c), for firing explosives with an
        impermissible blasting unit.
     -- 75.316, for ordering the operation of two
        longwall shearers at the same time in violation of the
        methane and dust control plan.
     -- 75.1101-23(c), for failing to conduct mandatory
        fire drills and reporting in the "Fire Drill Record
        Book" that fire drills had been conducted.

     Johnson was sentenced in accordance with a plea
agreement, in which he agreed to cooperate in the
continuing investigation and related prosecutions
stemming from the explosion.

SCHOOLS IN W.VA. BENEFIT FROM SENTENCE

     A mine operator will pay a $50,000 criminal fine
and provide computers to Mingo County, W.Va.,
schools as part of the sentence stemming from a
blasting accident that injured one miner in 1989.
     The company, Meador Energy, pleaded guilty to
four counts of violating the Mine Act at its No. 1
mine near Newton, W.Va. The company had been
charged with five counts in a criminal information
filed Feb. 3 (MRR 2/12, p. 59).
     The Sept. 8, 1989, blasting accident injured one
miner whose arm was broken in four places. The
company pleaded guilty to using faulty pillar
recovery methods; firing unconfined explosives;
placing primed explosives without deenergizing
nearby electrical equipment; and allowing an
unqualified miner to fire shots.
     The company also gets four years' probation. As
part of the probation, the company volunteered to
provide 25 personal computers to five Mingo County
schools, along with installation and training.
     The company had faced a $1 million fine.

JUDGE THROWS CONTRACTOR INTO JAIL

     Saying coal dust sampling fraud must stop, a
federal judge in Beckley, W.Va., sentenced a
contractor to one year in jail and three years'
probation.
     West Virginia contractor Glen Morgan, who
operated under the name Kanawha Valley
Enterprises and later General Safety Services had
pleaded guilty in March to submitting false dust
samples to MSHA on behalf of operators as recently
as June 1991 (MRR 4/9, p. 168). Morgan also
admitted to providing false certification for required
miner training.
     U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Hallanan also fined
Morgan $5,000. Following his prison term, he cannot
engage in training miners or coal mine dust sampling
for three years.
     Morgan had faced a $250,000 fine and five years
in prison.

COAL VENDOR PLEADS TO RACKETEERING

     Sentencing is scheduled Aug. 31 for a
businessman who has pleaded guilty in connection
with a racketeering scheme which bilked coal
companies of more than $900,000.
     Robert S. Painter, owner/operator of Bluefield,
W.Va.-based Abbs Valley Electric, entered the plea
recently before U.S. District Judge Samuel Wilson in
Abingdon, Va.
     Painter, along with other defendants, are said to
have defrauded several companies of more than
$900,000 over a five year period. Companies burned
in the scheme included Peabody Coal, Eastern
Associated Coal, Island Creek, CONSOL, Canada
Coal and Pittston subsidiary Sea B Mining.
     "The investigation revealed that Painter provided
cash kickbacks, prostitutes, and other items to coal
company employees to induce them to direct their
employers' business to Abbs Valley Electric,"
according to a government statement.
     False billings generated proceeds which were then
used by Painter to pay cash to the coal company
employees. Painter also pleaded guilty to conspiracy
to defraud the government of income taxes, and
illegal dumping of hazardous wastes.
     Also pleading guilty on conspiracy or income tax
charges were Painters' daughter and son-in-law,
Sherri and David Bailey; Abbs Valley salesman
Gerald Tabor; ex-Island Creek purchasing agent
Howard Cook; and Painter's brothers-in-law Richard
Weiner and Albert Harless. Nine defendants were
originally indicted.

ALJ IMPROPERLY AWARDED BACKPAY TO
MINER ON REMAND, FMSHRC RULES

     An ALJ erred in awarding backpay to a miner
when he reconsidered his decision on remand from
the commission, FMSHRC ruled.
     The miner, Ronny Boswell, won his
discrimination complaint filed against National
Cement Co., but ALJ Roy Maurer, in his initial
decision in February 1991, found the miner was not
entitled to backpay. Maurer found that the operator
had illegally disqualified Boswell from his job as a
utility laborer and reassigned him to a position as a
payloader operator based on a series of protected
work refusals.
     The operator appealed the case to the commission
and the panel sent it back to Maurer, asking him to
reconsider whether a particular incident involved
protected activity (MRR 3/13/92, p. 110).
     On remand, Maurer again sustained Boswell's
complaint, but this time he decided the miner was
entitled to a $6,094 award of backpay and interest, in
addition to his prior award of reinstatement (MRR
4/24/92, p. 188).
     The commission agreed with National Cement
that Maurer lacked jurisdiction to reexamine the
issue of Boswell's damages. The miner never
appealed the ALJ's initial ruling that he was not
entitled to backpay and that ruling became a final
commission decision, FMSHRC said.
     The panel also noted that it directed Maurer to
answer two questions on remand relating to the
merits of Boswell's discrimination complaint and
never ordered him to reopen the issue of damages.
FMSHRC vacated his supplemental damages award
and refused to review his other rulings in favor of the
miner.
     Boswell v. National Cement Co., FMSHRC
Docket No. SE 90-112-DM, 6/7/93.
     Representative for Boswell: Larry Myers, United
Paperworkers International Union, Dist. Council No.

SIXTH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS ALJ DECISION

     A federal appeals court affirmed an ALJ decision
that a miner was illegally discharged for making
safety complaints.
     In a brief, unpublished decision, the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Kem Coal Co.'s
claim that it discharged Charles T. Smith for
swearing at his supervisor (MRR Document No. 0528).
     The court said that ALJ William Fauver
"correctly pointed out that [the supervisor] provoked
Smith's outburst by flatly denying that he had ever
ordered Smith to work under falling coal."
     The court also found that "Smith's complaint
about the hazards of the falling coal, [his
supervisor's] denial of his order to work under it and
Smith's reaction" by swearing "are inseparable."
     The 6th Circuit added that the company's
affirmative defense fails because the miner's
swearing "cannot reasonably be isolated as an
independent motive for the discharge."
     The commission had denied Kem Coal's petition
for review of Fauver's decision and the company
appealed the decision to the 6th Circuit.

MAY ACCIDENTS CLAIM SEVEN LIVES;
36 HAVE DIED SINCE JANUARY

     Seven miners lost their lives in May mining
accidents, with two deaths in underground mines and
five deaths at surface operations.
     Year-to-date reports show 36 fatalities since
January, with 15 miners dying in metal/nonmetal
accidents and 21 dying in coal accidents. Twenty-
one of the YTD deaths occurred at surface operations
and 15 at underground operations.
     Two miners were killed in machinery accidents in
May.
     David Workman was killed May 10 at the
Murphy No. 1 Preparation Plant of Min, Inc. in
Wharncliffe, W.Va. He had only one month of
experience.
     Workman, who was a general laborer for Fielding
Hydroseeding, was washing a Bowie hydroseeder
when he fell into the augers through an opening on
top of the tank. An access cover on top of the tank
had been removed.
     Roger D. Smith, Jr., a repairman for Limousine
Coal, Inc., was killed May 13 at the No. 3
underground mine in Dayhoit, Ky. He had three
years' experience and had been with the company for
one year.
     Smith was performing maintenance work with a
bolting machine and was positioned across a drill
boom. When his filter SCSR and lamp belt became
entangled in the controls, the boom raised and pinned
him to the roof, crushing him in the chest area. He
died less than two hours later.
     Three miners died in power haulage accidents in
May.
     Bruce E. Schoolcraft was killed May 12. He had
14 years' mining experience.
     Schoolcraft was an underground mine foreman
for Cross Mountain Coal, Inc.'s No. 6 mine in Lake
City, Tenn. He was operating a six-ton battery
locomotive when he became caught between the
mine roof and the frame of the locomotive. He died
instantly from head injuries.
     Bret Hatfield was killed May 3. He was an
apprentice mechanic/welder for Stewart-Nuss, Inc.'s
Blackstone Pit and Mill in Fresno, Ca.
     Hatfield was driving a welding truck when he
collided with a haul truck traveling in the opposite
direction on a pit haul road. Hatfield's truck burst
into flames on impact, and he died instantly. He had
over three years' mining experience.
     Glen Baese died on May 10 when he was crushed
by a screw conveyor. He was a plant foreman for
Carl Schlegel, Inc.'s Clinton County Pit mine in St.
Johns, Mich. He had three years' mining experience.
     Baese and two other employees were
investigating why a sand stacking conveyor had
stopped. While a dewatering screw was still running,
the buildup of sand at the top end of the screw tanks
caused the support structure of the unit to collapse.
The two employees assisting Baese jumped to safety
and escaped uninjured.
     Bill Anderson, a superintendent working at
Hardin County Materials Co.'s Plant No. 2, died on
May 17. Anderson got up on a conveyor belt to
examine spillage from a primary crusher and fell 14
feet to the ground. He had 30 years' of mining
experience.
     Thomas Reaska was killed May 27 at Midwest
Material Co.'s Lacon Plant in Lacon, Ill. He had 13
years' mining experience.
     Reaska, a mechanic at the mine, was dismantling
a crane boom to extend its length for other work.
When he drove an assembly pin out of the boom, the
boom fell on him.
     Reaska's accident was the third fatality involving
a boom this year.

BLAST DEBRIS KILLS CAR PASSENGER

     MSHA and OSM investigators are looking into a
blast at the Sugar Ridge Coal Co. surface mine in
Tennessee that caused small boulders and mud to fall
onto Interstate 75, killing a car passenger.
     The mine had been closed for more than a week
while MSHA tried to interview all the miners. The
accident occurred June 4, a Friday, and MSHA was
at the site that weekend.
     Investigators were supposed to conduct
interviews June 8. But as of June 14, one miner did
not want to be interviewed until his attorney got back
from vacation.
     Killed was Brian Agujar, 16, of Louisiana. He
was travelling with his family on vacation.
     MSHA said the company was blasting 240 feet
from the road, which is the legal distance. However,
blasting must be strictly controlled so debris does not
leave a blast site.

MSHA EXTENDS FINAL RULE STAYS

     Industry has been given a temporary reprieve on
provisions in the controversial explosives and
ventilation final rules.
     MSHA has stayed nine explosives provisions for
metal/nonmetal mines until Dec. 31 and stayed two
ventilation provisions for underground coal mines
until July 1, 1994.
     On the explosives rule, stayed are:

     > 30 CFR 56./57.6000, the definition of a "blast
site," which industry asked MSHA to clarify.
Industry asked MSHA to add language that unloaded
holes are not part of a blast site unless they are
within 30 feet of a loaded hole.
     > 56./57.6130(b) and 56.57.6131(a)(1) for
explosive storage facility provisions which may be in
conflict with other federal regulations.
     >  56./57.6202(a)(1), which would require that
vehicles containing explosives be structurally sound
and well maintained.
     > 56./57.6304(b) on primer protection. Industry
has asked for additional language that rigid
cartridges or bags could be slit and the contents
poured to cover the primer. There was also concern
over how much water should be in a hole when
cartridges are dropped.
     >  56./57.6306 on loading and blasting and what
activities are permitted in the blast site.
     > 56.57./6501(a) on nonelectric initiation
systems.
     > 56./57.6902(b) on the special precautions that
must be taken when blasting sulfide ores.
     > 56./57.6903 on burning explosive material.
Industry worries the current language would be
misconstrued by some who would stay to fight fires
involving explosives.

     On the ventilation regulation, stayed are:

     > 75.313, covering main mine fan stoppages with
persons underground.
     > 75.344(a)(1), which would require electric
compressors to be located in a noncombustible
structure or area.

MSHA DIST. 6 INSPECTORS ACCUSED OF
HARASSING COAL MINE OPERATORS

     MSHA says it is looking into complaints that
MSHA inspectors are harassing operators in Dist. 6
out of Pikeville, Ky.
     According to a letter written by David Gooch,
president of the Kentucky-based trade group Coal
Operators & Associates Inc., Dist. 6 operators have
had "problems with plans, enforcement and threats.
 ... Most of the difficulties seem to be traceable to
Jesse Cole, the District Manager."
     MSHA spokesperson Kathy Snyder said Cole is
an "experienced and highly respected manager with
MSHA," but added that the agency is investigating
Gooch's concerns.
     Gooch said his group has had meetings with Cole
regarding his policies and "taken as many as 40
operators with us at times." He said he even went to
MSHA headquarters in Arlington, Va., to meet with
Cole's superiors.
     Gooch says he is out to get evidence that
operators are being harassed, and he has put his
members on notice that they need to document
problems.
     "We need to be able to prove there is a pattern of
harassment, a pattern of inspectors and supervisory
personnel who have intentionally gone above and
beyond the scope of their authority, a pattern of
inspectors being allowed to do their jobs in an
improper manner," Gooch said.
     Gooch said an "improper manner could be
anything from loafing all day on your job, asking for
something of value, making threats, writing citations
and orders for non-existent violations and other such
improprieties."
     Operators have been told to keep a record of
inspections and write down what the inspectors do
while they are at the mine site. "If he sits in your
office three hours drinking coffee and leaves, write
that down. If he makes a threat or says anything that
is not according to regulations and policy, write that
down."
     But all of the documentation the industry group
wants, Gooch said, will all be kept confidential
because many of the operators "are afraid of
retaliation from MSHA."
     Meanwhile the local American Federation of
Government Employees union warned MSHA
inspectors to "be careful."
     Hugh Smith, the AFGE union president, told
MSHA inspectors in a memo: "It is evident that there
are coal operators trying to gather information
against you that could mean your job. Let's be
careful out there. Write what you find and
document!!!"

EASTERN FILES NLRB CHARGES AGAINST UMW; COURT GRANTS
PEABODY RESTRAINING ORDER

     Eastern Associated Coal Corp. has charged the
UMW with threatening and intimidating the
company's suppliers and vendors, while Peabody
Coal Co. was able to get a court order limiting strike-
related activity.
     The union has been on strike at these mines since
June 2.
     In charges filed with the National Labor Relations
Board, Eastern says UMW actions violate previously
issued NLRB orders from strike-related cases with
other companies.
     Eastern is seeking to halt what it calls strike-
related misconduct at its Federal No. 2 Mine in
Monongalia County, W.Va.
     The company filed four charges against the UMW
international and its affiliated members.
     The company filed two charges against the
international and UMW Local 1570.
     Eastern said the union has conducted "mass
picketing in numbers as high as 40 to 50" at Berry
Trucking of Rivesville, W.Va. Eastern said the
UMW has threatened to use violence against Berry
Trucking owners and threatened to damage Berry's
property.
     Berry Trucking is an independent contractor for
Eastern and "has a preexisting relationship to haul
coal before the strike," according to the filing.
Because of this, the union is actually conducting a
"secondary boycott," which violates Sect. 8(b)(4) of
the National Labor Relations Act, Eastern said.
     Eastern spokesperson Tom Gallager said the
charges were filed against the international and local
because local UMW members were picketing at
Berry's property. Picketing must be authorized by the
international. There was no evidence the district was
involved.
     Two other charges are aimed at the international,
the district and the local.
     In this case, Eastern charges the three union
affiliates with interfering and threatening suppliers
and employees who try to enter or leave the mine.
The union is also charged with trying to damage
vehicles that have attempted to cross the picket line.

Traffic on public roads halted, says Peabody

     In the Peabody case, the Warrick County, Ind.,
Circuit Court granted a temporary restraining order
preventing the UMW from obstructing traffic at the
company's Lynnville No. 1 mine near Lynnville, Ind.
     The court ordered the union to limit the number
of picketers to no more than two at any of the three
intersections where the obstructions have occurred.
     In its filing with the court, Peabody said that
UMW members were walking in "a slow and close-
file line" at the mine entrance and at county road
crossings adjacent to the mine. The union was
refusing requests to let traffic through and forced
drivers to wait up to three hours, according to the
company statement.

PEABODY, CONSOL HIT IN LATEST ROUND
OF UMW SELECTIVE STRIKES

     The UMW has expanded its selective strike to
more than a dozen additional mines for Peabody
Holding Co. and CONSOL in West Virginia, Illinois
and Kentucky.
     The fifth wave of the UMW strike against the
Bituminous Coal Operators' Assn. affects an
additional 3,000 miners and brings the total number
of strikers to 12,000. The job action adds
subcontractors to the list of operations being struck,
and the union said it will strike Peabody
subcontractors.
     "We have targeted the two largest coal producers
and the leadership of those companies, George 'Sam'
Shiflett at Peabody and Bobby Brown at CONSOL,
who are principal spokespeople for the BCOA," said
UMW President Richard Trumka.
     "And you can always tell when a strike is having
an effect when the coal companies become more
frantic in their actions," Trumka said of Peabody's
action against 163 miners in Kentucky.
     CONSOL operations hit in this latest phase
include Burning Star No. 2 in Illinois and Robinson
Run in West Virginia.
     Peabody operations hit include Baldwin mine and
Randolph preparation plant and related surface
facilities in Illinois, and the Martwick mine in
Kentucky.
     Eastern Associated was hit at Tygart River,
Lightfoot No. 1 and Colony Bay mines as well as the
Rocklick plant in West Virginia. "The UMWA-
elected officials are trying to damage Eastern
Associated but in the process, they may be cutting
off future job opportunities for our employees," said
Eastern President Peter Lilly.

PEABODY BACKS OFF FIRING 163 UMW MINERS, INSTEAD
ISSUES FOUR DAY SUSPENSION

     Peabody Coal Co. has backed off its initial plans
to fire 163 union members who allegedly tried to
shout down company President Sam Shiflett.
     Having originally announced it was suspending
the Camp No. 1 employees with intent to fire,
Peabody downgraded the punishment to a four-day
suspension without pay.
     In explaining its decision, the company said the
June 3 episode was probably instigated by union
leaders, but individuals miners must be held
accountable for their own actions. The mine resumed
operation Wednesday June 9 after being idle the
previous Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday.
     "We're glad they have come partially to their
senses," said UMW spokesperson Greg Hawthorne.
The union will still appeal the suspensions because
the miners were exercising "protected" activity, he
said.
     Peabody had announced plans to fire the miners
for insubordination after they refused to give Shiflett
their attention during a company meeting, by
chanting "contract, contract." UMW President
Richard Trumka the Peabody move a "high-handed
tactic befitting a plantation owner."
     But the critique by industry sources wasn't much
kinder.
     One lawyer said Peabody was smart to back off
its original hardline because attempting to sack the
miners would be a "grievous blunder in labor
relations."
     There was no way the firings would have ever
passed muster with the National Labor Relations
Board, the attorney said. It's silly for Peabody to
expect union miners would "sit there and listen to a
propaganda speech" while there's a strike going on.
     Another official expressed fear the UMW could
make potential firings into the type of rallying issue
similar to cancellation of retiree health benefits
during the Pittston strike. The episode also adds fuel
to the UMW argument that it's involved in an unfair
labor practices strike, at least in connection with
Peabody, the source said.

DECERTIFICATION ELECTION UP IN AIR FOR
BUCK CREEK COAL CO. MINERS

     The lawyer for a group of Buck Creek Coal
employees who want out of the UMW has renewed a
request for a decertification election, but the National
Labor Relations Board said no such vote will happen
soon.
     A May 6 decision by a three-member panel of the
NLRB was a mixed verdict for Buck Creek and the
UMW.
     The panel upheld an ALJ ruling that Buck Creek
implemented a flex schedule without first bargaining
with the union -- but also struck down the judge's
decision to add nine months onto the union's
"certification year." That's the time period in which a
union has to reach a labor contract with a newly-
organized operation.
     As a result of the latter development, Jim Hanson,
a lawyer for the "Vote No Committee" at Buck
Creek, has renewed his request that the NLRB
proceed with a decertification election.
     The board has yet to respond to Hanson's letter,
but "at this point it does not look like there's going to
be an election any time soon," said an NLRB
official.
     Before the petition could move forward Buck
Creek must comply with NLRB's May order. Also
current unfair labor practice charges filed by the
NLRB must be cleared up before any decert vote.
The union went on strike against Indiana's biggest
deep mine in April. Although the operation was
organized in late 1991, the two sides have failed to
reach a contract.

VOTE SCHEDULED AT ZEIGLER SUBSIDIARY ON HEELS OF
SUCCESSFUL MARROWBONE VOTE

     With the UMW on an emotional high from its
apparent victory at Marrowbone Development, a
certification vote is set June 28 for another non-
union subsidiary of Zeigler Coal Holding.
     Zeigler's SMC Mining stands behind the decision
of management at Wolf Creek Collieries to
"vigorously oppose" the UMW drive, said company
official Vic Svec.
     Wolf Creek is located just across the Kentucky
line from Marrowbone. The National Labor
Relations Board confirmed that Marrowbone
employees had voted 256-to-151 to join the union.
There were 33 challenged ballots. The company had
not announced by press time if it planned to
challenge the election or the campaign leading up to
it.
     Industry opinions vary on whether Marrowbone
signals a brighter day for UMW or was merely a
flash in the pan.
     An official with a rival coal company subscribes
to the latter theory. The UMW had some "really
stupid management helping them" at Marrowbone,
he said. The source thinks the UMW also has an
excellent chance at Wolf Creek.
     Wolf Creek returned to work in late-May
following a two-and-a-half week walkout sparked by
changes in retiree medical benefits, officials said. It's
hard to say how the Marrowbone vote may affect the
Bituminous Coal Operators' strike. Most officials
think it will hearten the UMW. Others think BCOA's
B.R. Brown could use it as evidence that the UMW
can organize mines without extensive job rights at
non-union operations.
     Marrowbone has filed formal objections to the
way the union conducted its campaign leading up to
the certification vote. The company claims UMW
officials made unlawful threats and promises
throughout the campaign.
     Among the claims in the two-page document is an
allegation that the union said it would add 10 years
eligibility toward the UMW pension after two years
of credited service, as an inducement to vote pro-
union. "By such conduct, petitioner unlawfully
interfered with employees in their exercise of free
choice in the election."

BCOA FILES SUIT TO STOP AMAX WITHDRAWAL; AMAX SAYS IT
WILL BARGAIN WITH CYPRUS

     The Bituminous Coal Operators' Assn. has filed a
lawsuit against AMAX Coal Co. to prevent AMAX
from exiting the multi-employer bargaining group.
     AMAX announced last week, following a
decision to merge with Cyprus Minerals Co. of
Englewood, Colo., that it would withdraw from the
BCOA. Cyprus bargains independently of the
BCOA, and its current contract does not expire until
July 1.
     "If I were on BCOA I'd be furious and I'd file
suit," said an industry source the day before the suit
was filed.
     BCOA has accused the union of "inducing" AMAX to
withdraw from BCOA in the midst of contract talks to
enable the nation's third-largest coal producer to
negotiate its own agreement. BCOA said the law is
clear, and that once negotiations begin, companies in
a multi-employer group must be bound by the contract
negotiated by that group. They cannot cut their own
deals.
     AMAX said last week it is withdrawing from the
group because it will be governed by the labor
agreement that its merger partner, Cyprus Minerals,
is negotiating with the UMW. Cyprus is talking with
the union about its Emerald and Cumberland mines
in Pennsylvania and the Kanawha mine in West
Virginia.
     But the provision that limits AMAX's or any
other company's right to leave BCOA is a murky
area of labor law. Defections are acceptable under
"unusual circumstances" -- a term that has never
been explicitly defined by the courts. Some think the
Cyprus-AMAX consolidation constitutes such
circumstances.
     One industry source finds the AMAX defection
from BCOA more puzzling now than if it had come
before the merger announcement. AMAX's presence
would have given the Cyprus-AMAX hybrid insight
into BCOA bargaining. The source also described
AMAX as a "fairly soft" member of BCOA -- while
Cyprus Minerals has not been reluctant to lock horns
with unions in the past.
     The same industry official thinks it does the union
little good to knock off contract deals one-by-one.
The union doesn't appear to have the ability to
conduct more than one set of major talks at once, the
source said. Furthermore, the UMW is still not going
to make any real gains without eventually going
through Peabody and CONSOL, the source said.

IRREBUTABLE PRESUMPTION PROVISION OF
KY. LAW CONSTRUED BY STATE COURT

     The Kentucky Court of Appeals held that a miner
must show exposure to coal dust caused his disability
in order to be entitled to the irrebutable presumption
of total disability set forth in KRS 342.732(1)(c).
     The miner argued he submitted the required X-ray
evidence and met the necessary spirometric test
values to trigger the statute's irrebutable
presumption. However, the court read into the statute
the requirement that a claimant must also prove that
he contracted pneumoconiosis from work-related
exposure to coal dust (MRR Document No. 0527).
     The court remanded the case and ordered the ALJ
to determine whether the claimant's disability was
caused by his cigarette smoking or exposure to coal
dust. If his disability was caused by both factors, he
is still entitled to an award of benefits if coal dust
exposure was a "medically significant cause of the
respiratory impairment," the court said.
     The court read the necessary causation
requirement into the statute, finding the legislature
left it out as an "oversight."
     The court reversed an ALJ's award of total
permanent disability benefits that was affirmed by
the Workers' Compensation Board.
     Four judges dissented, stating that KRS
342.732(1)(c) is "clear upon its face" and should be
read "precisely as written." Under the statute, an
irrebutable presumption of total disability resulting
from exposure to coal dust is triggered if the required
X-ray evidence and respiratory impairment test
results are submitted, the dissenting judges said,
finding "nothing absurd or unreasonable in this
result."

ALABAMA COURT UPHOLDS BENEFITS AWARD TO MINER WHO
EARNED MORE AFTER INJURY

     A miner who returned to his same position and
earned more money after he injured his arm may still
keep his award of workers' compensation benefits
based on a finding of 31% loss of earning capacity,
an Alabama Appeals court ruled.
     The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals said that
when a worker's post-injury earnings equal or exceed
his earnings at the time of the injury, there is a
presumption of earning capacity commensurate with
earnings.
     However, the miner rebutted this presumption by
introducing independent evidence that his post-injury
earnings were an unreliable basis for estimating his
earning capacity, the court said (MRR Document No. 0519).
     The miner showed his post-injury increase in
earnings resulted primarily from collective
bargaining salary increases; his working hours
increased since his 1986 accident; and he received
assistance from co-workers, the court noted. A
vocational rehabilitation expert also testified that the
miner had lost access to a "significant number of
jobs" because of his injury.

Judges' Decisions

(will become final in 40 days unless ordered
reviewed)
     MSHA v. ADAMS STONE CORP., 6/9/93. Civil
penalty proceedings: A judge ordered a small
Kentucky limestone operator to pay $3,425 in
penalties for six violations of Part 56 standards,
discovered during an MSHA investigation of a
serious accident at the quarry (MRR Document No. 0534).
     An MSHA inspector issued six Sect. 104(d)(1)
citations and orders after investigating the accident in
which the assistant quarry superintendent fell 30 feet
from the top of a primary crusher and suffered
permanently disabling injuries.
     The judge found that the operator committed an
S&S violation of 30 CFR 56.15005 because
unrebutted evidence established that the assistant
superintendent was not wearing a safety belt or line
when he fell. He agreed with MSHA that the
operator was guilty of "unwarrantable failure"
because the assistant superintendent was an agent of
mine management and knew his actions were unsafe.
He fined the company $1,600 for the violation.
     MSHA cited the operator for a second S&S
violation of 30 CFR 56.15005 after the inspector
observed two miners working on top of the crusher
without wearing safety belts or lines the day
following the accident. The judge agreed the
violation was S&S and also caused by the operator's
unwarrantable failure, finding that mine management
had an obligation to ensure that miners who
continued to work on the crusher after the accident
wore safety belts and lines to prevent another serious
accident. He fined the operator $1,000.
     The judge ruled the operator also violated 30 CFR
56.18009 because the inspector found six miners
dismantling the primary crusher for repair without a
"competent person" in charge as required by the
standard. He ruled the violation was S&S, but not the
result of unwarrantable failure because one member
of the crew, the crane operator, was an experienced
and trained employee who could take over in the
event of an emergency. He assessed a $225 civil
penalty.
     The judge also assessed penalties totaling $600
for three violations of explosives standards. He held
that the company violated 30 CFR 56.6313, because
two large limestone boulders had been drilled and
charged with explosives and left unattended and
unbarricaded for one week; 30 CFR 56.6320,
because the operator exceeded the 72-hour time limit
between charge and blast times; and 30 CFR
56.6305, because unused explosive materials were
not moved to a protected area within a reasonable
time after the boulders were charged.
     The operator argued that three separate citations
were not justified because they concerned a single
condition. However, the judge found the cited
standards impose separate and distinct duties on the
operator and he ruled the three citations were not
duplicative. He said the violations of 30 CFR
56.6313 and 56.6305 were S&S, citing the hazards of
a premature detonation. However, he said MSHA
failed to prove that the operator was aware that the
boulders had been drill and charged, and he ruled the
violations were not the result of its unwarrantable
failure (Koutras, Judge; Nos. KENT 92-604-M and
92-770-M).
     Attorney for Adams Stone: David Adams, P.O.
Box 2853, Pikeville, Ky. 41402.

     JERRY IKE HARLESS TOWING INC. v.
MSHA, 6/2/93. Contest proceeding: A company that
dredges sand from a riverbed is an operator under the
Mine Act and must file a legal identity report with
MSHA as required by 30 CFR 56.1000, a judge ruled
(MRR Document No. 0515).
     The judge ruled the company violated 30 CFR
56.1000 and ordered it to filed the required report
within 21 days.
     He rejected as "frivolous" the company's
arguments that sand is not a mineral and that it
extracted sand in liquid form. The judge noted that
MSHA routinely oversees sand and gravel dredging
operations and said the company's extraction and
preparation of sand through its filtering process are
clearly activities covered by Sect. 3(h)(1) of the
Mine Act.
     However, the found that another corporation
owned by the same individual that stores and sells
the sand is not subject to the Mine Act (Feldman,
Judge; No. CENT 92-276-RM).
     MSHA v. MULLINS AND SONS COAL CO.,
6/3/93. Civil penalty proceeding: A judge agreed
with a coal company that its conceded S&S
violations of coal dust standards 30 CFR 75.400 and
75.402 were not the result of its "unwarrantable
failure" (MRR Document No. 0535).
     An MSHA inspector cited the operator after he
discovered loose coal, coal dust and float dust
accumulations ranging from three to six inches deep
for a distance of 180 feet. He described the
accumulations as black and found no evidence of
significant rock dust content.
     The inspector based his unwarrantable failure
charge on the fact that the accumulations were noted
in the pre-shift examiner's book. However, the judge
found that the notation acknowledging the
accumulations was a mitigating factor in assessing
the degree of the company's negligence.
     The judge also noted that the accumulations had
existed for only three hours and that the operator's
scoop was out of service and being charged.
     While not guilty of unwarrantable failure, the
judge found the operator was moderately negligent
and assessed a total of $1,000 in penalties (Feldman,
Judge; No. KENT 92-669).

Mullins, vice president, Mullins and Sons Coal Co.,
Box 4028, Upper John's Creek Rd., Kimper, Ky.

Labor Dept., 2002 Richard Jones Rd., Suite B-201,
Nashville, Tenn. 37215.
     MSHA v. QUARTO MINING CO., 6/7/93. Civil
penalty proceeding: A judge fined a coal mine
operator $800 for an S&S violation of 30 CFR
77.1606(c) because of a defective steering wheel on
a front-end loader (MRR Document No. 0533).
     The inspector discovered the malfunction when
he asked the equipment operator to demonstrate the
steering on an idling Caterpillar 988 front-end loader
in the mine's supply yard. When the steering wheel
was turned to the right, it locked in position, forcing
the equipment operator to use both hands to break
the lock. Then the wheel would spin very fast,
causing a potential loss of control of the vehicle, the
judge found.
     The equipment operator told the inspector the
condition was intermittent and that he had reported
the malfunction to the shop foreman, who was
unable to correct the problem.
     The judge found that the malfunctioning steering
was an obvious safety defect. He ruled the violation
was S&S because it presented a hazard to the
equipment operator, to pedestrians and to other
vehicle drivers. He also found the operator guilty of
"unwarrantable failure" because the shop foreman
knew of the defect for several months and failed to
correct the defect or remove the loader from service
(Fauver, Judge; No. LAKE 92-309).

though the bonds were issued when the government
did not require bonding, a federal court ruled.
     U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Tennessee upheld an IBLA ruling that the bonds were
"statutory bonds," and OSM became the
successor-in-interest to the bonds when it took over
Tennessee's program (MRR Document No. 0517). Exchange
Insurance Co. had challenged the IBLA decision
ordering the company to forfeit two bonds worth
$81,000.
     Tennessee had enacted its program in 1980, only
to kill it on Oct. 1, 1984. Exchange issued two
performance bonds for two mining permits filed
during the state's interim program. The bonds were
issued when a bond was required by state law, but
not by federal law.
     When the federal government was taking over the
state's program, it announced in the Federal Register
that it would not assume responsibility over interim
program bonds. In addition, the state's attorney
general said that bonds in which no forfeiture
proceedings had started before Oct. 1, 1984, were
voided by the legislative repeal of the Tennessee
program.
     But the attorney general also noted that the
federal government succeeded to any permanent
program bonds in which forfeiture proceedings had
not yet started.
     Although the bonds were originally issued under
the interim rule, they were used to support second
permits under the final rule. It was this point when
the bonds became "statutory bonds."
     Exchange tried to argue that when the federal
government took over the program it required
permittees to change the payee of the bonds to
include the federal government as "co-payee" within
30 days of the effective date of the new program.
     Exchange never complied with this order, but it
was also never challenged by the government for not
complying. Exchange said that this is evidence that
the government did not consider the original bonds
payable to it.
     But because the bonds had been transferred to
second permits, with Exchange's consent, to support
permanent program permits, this made them
statutory bonds, and OSM the successor in interest.
     Exchange Insurance Co. v. IBLA; USDistCt,
EDistTenn No. CIV-3-92-683; 4/9/93.

ANDALEX TRUCK ROUTE TOO DANGEROUS
BECAUSE OF SCHOOL, RESIDENTS SAY

     Residents are up in arms over Andalex's plan to
run double-trailer coal trucks through their town
which is 100 miles away from the coal-rich Kaiparowits
area in southern Utah.
     Nearly 200 residents of Hurrican, Utah, which
lies on the state route that would be used to reach
rail loadout points, turned out for a protest meeting
last week.
     Townspeople say the 45-ton trucks would wear
out the roads, cause air and noise pollution and add
to the congestion already a problem with traffic
heading to and from Zion National Park.
     But they were particularly upset about the safety
of children at the school, which is at bottom of a
steep two-mile long 8% grade hill on the truck route.
They say the grade increases the danger of a runaway
truck.
     Their concern was backed up by the Southern
Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) who used
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety statistics
showing double-trailer trucks are two to three times
more likely to have an accident than single-trailer
trucks.
     The alliance has been fighting development of
coal-rich Kaiparowits for decades.
     A representative of a trucking firm working with
Andalex said the latest trucks are better able to
negotiate the steep inclines because they have more
braking power per ton than those built a few years
ago.
     The noisy protest meeting early this month added
to the controversy surrounding Andalex's plan to
mine 400 million tons of coal from Smoky Hollow
which lies between two wilderness areas and next to
a national recreation area.
     Andalex wants to use the trucks to get the coal to
rail lines in Utah and Nevada.

CALIFORNIA DESERT MUST BE PROTECTED FROM MINING,
EXPLOITATION, SAYS BABBITT

     Land exchanges will be used to preserve areas of
the Southeast California desert if legislation makes it
through the House and Senate.
     Desert protection legislation would create 74
wilderness areas and upgrade Joshua Tree National
Monument and Death Valley National Monument to
national park status.
    The House version would make the East Mojave
Desert a national monument and the Senate version
would make it a national park. The Senate version is
the most restrictive of the two, which the
administration prefers, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt told the House subcommittee on national
parks June 15.
     Most of the land owned by the government, more
than 7 million acres, would be designated as
"wilderness," closing the land to mining. If the land
is designated a "national park," then mining may be
permitted.
     Babbitt noted that in the California desert, "You
can still see roads cut through sand by Conestoga
wagons," and "scars mark the mines that delivered
fortunes to claim settlers who would not be turned
away."
     The interior secretary said the desert is threatened
by "those who would pillage its subtle beauty."

Many forms need protection, says Babbitt

     Babbitt agrees with environmental groups that
legislation is needed to protect sand dunes, extinct
volcanos, archaeological sites and rare plant and
animal life, and that protection is needed from
mining and grazing.
        Babbitt also stressed that the entire "ecosystem"
needed protection, and not protecting one area would
harm an entire region.
     Additions proposed for the Joshua Tree National
Park would include the Coxcombe Mountains, Pinto
Basin and Pinto Mountains, Little San Bernardino
Mountains and the Eagle Mountains.
     "Resource protection would be greatly enhanced
here with the full ecosystem included under one
management entity," Babbitt said.
     But Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., sees taxpayers
ending up with a huge bill to acquire the land or
giving up valuable federal lands in land exchanges.

Company, schools own large parcels

     One of the debates centered around land owned
by the Catellus Corp.
     Babbitt supports land exchanges for the Catellus
land and California school lands, which are the two
entities that own the vast majority of non-federal
land in the area.
    Lewis said that 355,000 acres owned by Catellus
are worth between $750 and $1,500 an acre.
     But Babbitt called these figures "absurd," and said
the department would work out exchanges providing
Catellus with federal land that had similar
characteristics to the Catellus land that would be part
of the protected area.
     There is another area of the desert, however, that
poses a different problem.
     The Lanfair Valley area contains about 1,000
small, individually owned private parcels. Babbitt's
concern is that these will be developed once the park
is established.
     Babbitt said the government must think of an
"innovative approach" to deal with the private land
holdings or purchase the properties through
condemnation.
     Although Babbitt did not directly say that he
supports "zoning" the area, he did say that he
supports a "comprehensive land use plan for the
valley to promote park purposes while affording
private landholders the maximum flexibility to
continue traditional and appropriate uses of their
land."

COURT CONSIDERS AMAX PERMIT

     With AMAX having mined out its Skyline Glady
Fork reserves, resolving the environmental concerns
delaying a new permit at the Tennessee operation has
taken on a new urgency.
     While lawyers for AMAX and OSM argue the
merits of the company's toxic materials handling
plan in a Knoxville courtroom, Skyline employees
are shipping from coal stockpiles to the Tennessee
Valley Authority's Widow's Creek.
     "Basically, we've finished mining, we're mined
out," said AMAX spokesperson Kevin Feeney.
Skyline finished work on the Glady Fork section in
mid-May. The company has enough stockpiled coal
to satisfy the customer for several weeks, Feeney
said.
     Interior Dept. ALJ David Torbett is considering
Skyline's permit request to commence mining on the
Big Brush section now that Glady Fork is mined out.
Earlier this year AMAX was successful in getting a
federal court order which reversed an OSM decision
that stopped mining at Glady Fork (MRR 2/12, p.
70).

OSM, MONTANA HOLD ENFORCEMENT MEETING;  MERIDIAN
SUSPENDS WORK UNTIL SEPTEMBER

     Montana regulators and OSM plan an informal
conference June 30 in Billings to discuss the state's
enforcement of SMCRA.
     Earlier this month Northern Plains Resource
Council asked OSM to take over that portion of the
Montana Dept. of State Lands program, which
oversees Meridian Minerals' plans for a major new
longwall operation (MRR 6/4, p. 285).
     OSM Acting Director Hord Tipton found merit in
the environmental group's concerns and instructed
the state to suspend the Bull Mountains No. 1 permit
because Montana was not effectively enforcing the
law.
     Meridian has "voluntarily entered into a cessation
of operations" until Sept. 1, said Bonnie Lovelace,
who oversees coal and uranium reclamation for the
Montana program. The company wants to commence
road construction at the coal complex prior to
Montana's snowfall season -- which hits high gear in
November, officials said.
     Meanwhile "we'll be making our points" at the
conference. The state will try to convince OSM that
Tipton's concerns have been addressed. It will also
question the legality of OSM potentially suspending
primacy in one regard to an individual permit.
     Montana officials say any shortcomings on
Meridan's Bull Mountains Mine enforcement, such
as failure to file certain public notices, hardly justify
potential suspension of primacy. State officials also
say the Resource Council has been involved in every
step of the permit process at Bull Mountains.
     OSM representatives have said their goal isn't
revoking Montana's primacy but merely ensuring
SMCRA is enforced properly.

EPA PROPOSES OFF-ROAD EQUIPMENT RULE FOR ENGINES
BIGGER THAN 50 HORSEPOWER

     It's finally come to this: a rule so big the
government can't or won't publish it in the Federal
Register.
     Twelve hundred pages of an EPA nonroad engine
regulation proposal, including uncondensable graphs
and diagrams, are available on computer disk. EPA
was kind enough, however, to publish the proposed
rule's 36-page preamble.
     According to the preamble, nonroad equipment
with engines more than 50 horsepower, including
construction, logging and mining machines, would
be regulated for nitrogen oxides (NOX) and smoke
emissions.
     Engines that would be excluded from regulation
include those that are regulated by MSHA for
underground use.
     Under authority of the 1990 Clean Air Act, which
by the way was just 313 pages long, EPA began
studying emissions from nonroad engines and
vehicles and determined that the equipment kept at
least one area of the U.S. from meeting national
ambient air quality standards for ozone and carbon
monoxide.
     A critical part of the problem, the agency said, is
the formation of ozone in and downwind of big
cities. EPA said these emissions can also cause areas
outside big cities to fall below federal standards.
     But the American Mining Congress disagrees
with EPA. Mines are located mostly in remote,
undeveloped areas and do not cause those regions to
fall below the federal ambient area standards, an
AMC source said.
     While the optimal engine cutoff size has not been
determined, engine manufacturers and other industry
sources have suggested a cutoff in the range of 450
to 750 horsepower -- a far cry from the 50-
horsepower minimum under the EPA proposal.
     Engines used to propel vehicles or power
equipment, such as mobile cranes, or those used as
auxiliary engines, such as for refrigerated trailers,
would be regulated as well.

Emission credit program proposed

     EPA has proposed an averaging, banking and
trading program for large nonroad compression-
ignition engines in the hopes of providing
manufacturers "flexibility in meeting the proposed
NOX standard without reducing environmental
benefits."
     The program would allow manufacturers to earn
emission "credits" and bank them for future
averaging or trading. The credits could then be
applied to engines that are difficult to standardize.
     Engines in California would be excluded from the
credit program because the state requires that all
engines sold there meet the NOX standard.
     If manufacturers use the program, changes in
equipment design would be minimal, according to
EPA. There would be no effects on 50- to 100-
horsepower equipment, while flexibility would be
allowed for those engines requiring substantial
changes.
     Given that all manufacturers participate in the
emission credit program, the average annual cost to
develop and make engines meeting NOX and smoke
emissions standards would be $29 million.
     EPA assumes that manufacturers will pass any
increased costs of regulation to the consumer by
raising the prices of their engines. EPA's estimated
average price increase for 1996 is $110 per engine.
     AMC says the mining industry disputes this
figure and believes that the real cost per engine could
be much higher.
     EPA's Selective Enforcement Auditing program
would require nonroad engine manufacturers to test
newly assembled engines for emissions compliance.
This section of the proposed rule was designed to
establish an annually limited number of audits for
each manufacturer.
     EPA will hold a hearing on the proposed
regulation in Ann Arbor, Mich., on June 25. Written
comments to EPA are due July 27.
     To obtain a copy of the proposal or to order the
computer disks contact: EPA, Air Docket, Mail Code
LE-131,  401 M St. S.W., Room M-1500,
Washington, D.C. 20460, or call 202-260-7548.

ASARCO NAMED PRP AT TRIUMPH

     ASARCO Inc., the Idaho Dept. of Lands and
Triumph Minerals Inc. have been named as the
potentially responsible parties at the Triumph Mine
Tailings Piles site, which was recently proposed for
Superfund listing.
     EPA is continuing a search for PRPs and is
planning an expedited protective action to prevent
continued exposure to residents.
     A risk assessment identified arsenic as the
primary contaminant of concern. Several areas,
including tailings piles, a mine process foundation
area and several residential yards, pose acute and
chronic exposure risks from arsenic levels.
     Preliminary bioavailablity study results show
arsenic is more readily absorbed than lead. The study
was done by feeding dirt from the site to pigs.
     EPA is evaluating results of the risk assessment to
identify the arsenic concentration that should be used
as the action level for expedited response.

Discovery

     UNITED STATES V. MIKE POLESCHOOK
AND PETER POLESCHOOK, 4/12/93, CACA
29892. OHA declared a placer mining claim void
because of lack of valuable discovery of gold,
despite the placer holder's willingness to expend
more time and effort to locate valuable mineral
deposits.
     The government brought the case before OHA on
the basis of a finding of an inspector from the U.S.
Forest Service that the Bend Ten placer mining claim
in Butte County, Calif., cannot be mined at profit.
This finding was made on the basis of the value of
the gold so far extracted and despite the fact that
Poleschook testified that he believed the gold could
be found in a deep hole on the site.
     OHA noted Poleschook had not mined in that
hole and that the hole is in accessible. This means it
would not be possible to mine it in a manner that
would be economical according to the standards of
"the prudent person." Further, the appeals panel
found, "Mr. Poleschook's willingness to expend his
labor and means is not in itself enough to meet the
prudent person test."
     U.S. V. JOHN R. PICHOWICZ, 5/12/93, A MC
303306-303313. OHA ruled eight mining claims to
be null and void for failure to discover valuable
mineral deposits, after rejecting the contestee's claim
that the government should have gone beyond the
mining work done by the contestee to identify more
valuable samples.
     OHA found BLM presented a solid prima facie
case that valuable gold deposits had not been
identified. BLM's mineral report and cost analysis
showed John Pichowicz would have to expend
$3.59/cubic yard to mine the claims, which were
located within Arizona's Muggins Mining District.
That fact was not rebutted by Pichowicz. OHA said,
though, the analysis might have underestimated the
cost to mine the claims because reclamation,
operating dry concentrations and other issues were
not taken into account.
     OHA felt BLM also overestimated the value of
the gold by failing to account for a 5-15% loss in
gold recoverability that would result from the dry
placer methods Pichowicz proposed to use. The
highest gold value BLM identified was $2.44/cubic
year. So, using the best sample, it would be expected
Pichowicz would lose $1.15/cubic yard of material
mined, OHA said.
     The contestee did not offer any substantial
evidence of discovery, but instead criticized BLM's
sampling methods for failing to reach the bedrock.
But, OHA held, "a government mineral examiner has
no obligation to explore or sample beyond the
mining claimant's workings or to perform sufficient
work to reach a definite conclusion as to whether a
valuable mineral deposit does or does not exist"
within the claim. "If a valuable mineral deposit
exists, it is incumbent upon the claimant to discover
it" at the time of the hearing, OHA held.
     OHA also rejected Pichowicz's request for
compensation for the fair market value of his claims.
"The federal government may withdraw its land from
mineral entry regardless of any right a prospector
may have to exclude others from the claim under the
doctrine of pedis possessio," OHA held.

Jurisdication

     CONSOLIDATED COAL CO. V. OSM, CH 91- 9-R,
4/12/93. OHA rejected a challenge to a NOV because the
challenge should have been brought not before the
hearings division but in a U.S. district court.
     OSM issued a NOV charging that Consolidated
Coal Co. failed to: regrade, protect and stabilize all
areas disturbed by coal mining; control discharge to
stop erosion; establish sediment control for a
haulroad; establish a permanent vegetative cover on
a disturbed area; and compact material used to
backfill and maintain drainage for the northeastern
portion of the permit area.
     Consolidated did not dispute the facts. Rather, it
claimed that OSM did not have the power to issue
the NOV because SMCRA does not authorize OSM
to issue such NOVs in states with approved
regulatory programs, such as Pennsylvania, unless
there is a finding of widespread enforcement
deficiencies within that program and no such finding
has been made, Consolidated argued.
     The ALJ said however, that Consolidated's
challenge must fail because it is well settled that a
challenge to SMCRA regulations must be brought in
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia
Circuit within 60 days of promulgation of the
regulations (30 U.S.C. Sect. 1276(a)(1)(1982)). "The
District of Columbia circuit has exclusive
jurisdiction over such challenges," the judge said.

Placer Mining

     U.S. V. JAMES UBERT, RITA AUBERT,
RENEE AUBERT AND JASON OTEN, 4/12/93,
CA MC 244967-244968. OHA ruled a placer mining
operation should not be allowed when it was found
to be unprofitable, while at the same time it would
reduce the income from recreational use of a river
within the permit area.
     BLM's California office transmitted to the
Hearings Division a dispute involving the Mote A-B
and Mote C placer mining claims, which were
located in a power site withdrawal on the
Mokelumne River.
     Despite adequate notice the contestees (the claim
holders) did not appear at the hearing.
     At issue was the question whether the mining
operations would substantially interfere with other
uses of the lands covered by the claim. A BLM
geologist testified that the mining operations would
disturb nearly a mile of the Mokelumne River,
interfering with recreational uses of the river. Also,
an official with the East Bay Municipal Utility
District said siltation generated by eight suction
dredges to be used in the operation could impact the
storage capacity of the downstream Pardee
Reservoir.
     The OHA administrative law judge looked at the
revenues over five years from recreational activities
-- $2,000,000 -- that would be substantially reduced
by the mining activity. He compared that with the 20
people who would be employed by the mining
activity and the $100,000 loss the gold mining
operation would suffer over five years. Based on this
comparison, OHA found "placer mining would
substantially interfere with other land uses and that
placer mining should be prohibited" in the areas in
question.

Reclamation

     GATLIFF COAL CO. V. OSM, 5/11/93, NX 92-
6-R.     OHA sustained a NOV after ruling that
OSM's prima facia case that permit violations had
occurred was not refuted by a claim that actions
taken in violation of a permit were just as effective
as the original requirements in reclaiming the land.
     OHA faced review of a NOV for drainage
problems on a permit. OSM cited Gatliff Coal Co.
for:

     > "Failure to construct and maintain Basin 703 in
       accordance with approved plans.
     > Failure to construct [diversion ditch] No. 18 in
       accordance with approved plans."

     An OSM inspector said that Basin 703, which
was depicted in the permit as a permanent
impoundment, had been mined through. The
inspector further found that the diversion ditch
drained into Basin 704, instead of Basin 703 as the
permit required.
     The NOV required reconstruction of Basin 703
and a change in drainage from the diversion ditch.
Gatliff completed the first remedial measures and
filed for review of the NOV.
     OHA noted that in reviewing the NOV, the
burden of establishing a prima facia case would be
OSM's, while the ultimate burden of persuasion
would rest with the challenger.
     OSM "clearly carried its burden of proof," the
OHA administrative law judge held, because it
provided unrefuted evidence two aspects of the
permit were violated. Gatliff did not provide

"attempted to show only that the structures it had in
place were just as effective as those which should
have been constructed." Since the rebuttal failed, the
NOV was sustained.

UNUSED FORFEITED BOND COULD BE RETURNED IF SITE IS
MINED BY ANOTHER OPERATOR

     Kentucky has submitted proposed amendments to
OSM on bond forfeitures and general provisions for
inspection and enforcement.
     Under bond forfeiture, the permittee and\or
operator, not just the operator as it stands now,
would be liable for the additional cost necessary to
achieve reclamation if the amount of the forfeited
bond is insufficient to pay the full cost of the
reclamation.
     It would also require that an unused forfeited
bond be returned to its owner if the state has not
completed the reclamation plan on the forfeited site
and the site is completely over-lapped by another
permit and completely disturbed by that over-lapping
permittee.
     Under inspections, the federal section of the rule
states that regular monthly partial inspections need
not be continued at minesites that are in temporary
cessation, although quarterly complete inspections
must continue.
     However Kentucky program rules do not provide
for a reduced inspection frequency at minesites in
temporary cessation. If approved, the new
amendment will provide reduced frequency of
inspections at such minesites.
     Copies of this file are available at the Lexington
Field Office, OSM, 2675 Regency Road, Lexington,
Ky. 40503-2922.
     Hearing requests are due June 28.
     For further information contact William Kovacic
at 606-233-2894.

CIVIL PENALTY MODIFICATION APPROVED

     OSM has given Ohio final approval on civil
penalty language.
     The rule allows the Ohio Reclamation Board to
forward penalties or remaining penalty balances to
the Dept. of Natural Resources for deposit in the coal
mining reclamation fund.
     Other amendments had called for revisions to 13
sections of the Ohio Revised Code which concerns
the retention of State civil penalties; refund of permit
fees, confidential information regarding exemption
requests for incidental coal extraction; and both the
Reclamation Supplemental Forfeiture Fund and the
Coal Mining Performance Bond Fund.
     It also concerns the limitations on award of costs
and expenses, reclamation contracts with surface
mine operators, reclamation of interim forfeited
areas, and many others.
     However, these statutory provisions are to be
incorporated into a state bill, which had not yet been
drafted. OSM will make a decision on the language
once the legislation is introduced and a copy of the
bill sent to OSM.
     Information on the language can be obtained from
the Columbus Field Office, OSM, 2242 S. Hamilton
Rd., Room 202, Columbus, Ohio 43232.
     For further information contact Richard Seibel at
614-866-0578 at the Columbus Field Office.

AMENDMENTS FACE COURT CHALLENGE

     The Pennsylvania Coal Assn. is challenging
OSM-approved provisions of the state's surface
mining program that go by the adage "ignorance is
no excuse."
     An OSM-approved amendment allows the state to
assess individual civil penalties against corporate
officers who do not knowingly and willfully
participate in a violation.
     Changes also approved by OSM override
Pennsylvania's "dual opportunity" appeal process.
The state has eliminated an operator's right to appeal
a violation when a civil penalty is appealed.
     Stephen Allen of Buchanan Ingersoll said this
provision is directly contrary to a 1988 court
decision, Kent Coal Mining Co., which upheld an
operator's right to appeal both a violation and an
excessive penalty.
     The association has asked the court to
permanently enjoin the state and OSM from
enforcement of both provisions and is asking for
attorney fees.

BONDING LANGUAGE PROPOSED

     OSM has received two proposed amendments
from Pennsylvania regarding self-bonding and
financial instruments permitted for posting
performance bonds.
     The new amendment would provide the permit
applicant with the option to use a self-bond as the
financial tool instead of a surety or collateral bond
for the performance bond. Performance bond's are
must be presented before a coal mine permit may be
issued or coal mining activities can begin.
     The state also wants to amend what is accepted as
a financial instrument for a performance bond.
     The state would like to add the options of life
insurance policies, annuities or trust funds as
acceptable financial instruments for posting
performance bonds.
     Comments are due by July 7, hearing requests
June 22.
     For additional information contact Robert Biggi,
OSM Harrisburg Field Office at 717-782-4036.
