<B>Of lost soles, drifting duckies and other spills of opportunity</B></CENTER> <P>
	On May 27, 1990 the freighter Hansa Carrier, enroute from Korea to the U.S., encountered a severe North Pacific storm. Spilled overboard from cargo containers were 61,000 Nike shoes. The incident was nearly forgotten until a year later when a Seattle newspaper reported incredulous beachcombers along the Oregon, Washington, and Canadian <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="duckiesmap.gif"ALT="[map]">coasts finding thousands of Nike shoes washing ashore. While Nike declined to take official notice of the discovery, the news attracted the attention of two oceanographers. <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

	"We saw this as a wonderful spill of opportunity," says Curt Ebbesmeyer, an oceanographer with the consulting firm of Evans-Hamilton, Inc. in Seattle, Washington. Ebbesmeyer and a colleague, James Ingraham of the National Marine Fisheries Service, reasoned if they collected enough documentation concerning the location and number of shoes found, the data could be used to hindcast the shoes' drift in much the same manner as is done with drift bottles periodically released in the mid-Pacific to track current patterns. <P>
	The oceanographers were helped considerably by media interest and by Oregon artist Steve McLeod, an avid beachcomber who traveled the coast and provided the scientists with the phone numbers of other beachcombers. Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham used only reports involving about 100 or more shoes, in time accumulating reports involving 1,600 "floaties," amounting to 2.6% of the total lost, a rate equal to the recovery rate for drift bottle drops which are usually released in groups of only 500-1,000. <P>
	Using a computer program called the Ocean Surface Current Simulations (OSCURS) , the oceanographers produced a hindcast drift simulation that  predicted the first shoes would reach Vancouver Island 220 days after the spill, a result that agreed quite closely with the date of the first reported sole survivors there. <P>
	As for the significant latitudinal distribution of the drifting shoes (about 300 kilometers), the oceanographers surmise that many winter-time arrivals may have been carried northward by the Davidson Current while others, arriving in the spring, encountered southerly moving currents, notably the California current which would eventually carry surviving soles westward back across the Pacific. <P>
	Indeed, as the scientists were preparing to publish their findings in the American Geophysical Union's publication EOS, they received reports of Nikes being found on the north end of the Big Island of Hawaii. The news was not unexpected. <P>
	"If any shoes survive long enough they could complete an entire Pacific circulation, about five to seven years," Ebbesmeyer explains. "Right now [fall, 1995], the hot spots are the Philippines and all of Japan. And some of the shoes should be coming back to Washington and Oregon soon." <P>
	Lost Nikes, are not the only drifters the oceanographers are continuing to track. In November,1992, when hundreds of 5- to 12-cm plastic bathtub toy animals (yellow ducks, blue turtles, red beavers and green frogs) began appearing on the beaches near Sitka, Alaska, the oceanographers again went into action, publishing notices in local papers and gathering reports of about 400 recoveries along approximately 850 km of the eastern Gulf of Alaska shore. This time, however, determining the origin of the toy spill proved a daunting task, for the owners of the cargo ship were anxious to avoid publicity. <P>
	"We spent months tracking down the ship's owners, talking to lawyers and executives, telling them we just wanted to know what the ocean was doing," Ebbesmeyer explains. The vessel's owners finally <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="nikeduckies.gif" ALT="[Nikes and duckies]">relented and, in exchange for anonymity, provided details concerning the loss of 29,000 toys from a container vessel, enroute from Hong Kong to Tacoma, Washington, that had encountered a severe winter storm January 10, 1992.<!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->

	Because the plastic toys are highly susceptible to surface winds (in contrast to the low-windage Nikes which float upside down, Ingraham and Ebbesmeyer had to integrate into the computer model the function of daily wind speed and direction provided by the Navy's Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center. From the resulting daily current vector fields they interpolated the trajectory of the toys. <P>
	The resulting calculation showed that the toys passed the point of the Nike shoe spill, then veered northward to begin traveling counterclockwise around the Gulf of Alaska gyre, then north through the Unimak Pass into the Bering Sea where, in the fall of 1994, they became entrapped and frozen in the transpolar drift which conveys ice over the North Pole at the rate of eight kilometers a day. <P>
	Eventually (as early as 1999) this ducky flotilla will debouche in the North Atlantic where it will be picked up by the eastward moving Gulf Stream. The toys will then bob their way onto the beaches of the British Isles, more than 15,000 kilometers from the start of their ocean peregrinations. <P>
	Drs. Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham agree that, given the very large release of 29,000 toys which are strong and highly resilient, they anticipate that by the turn of the century a few toys will have been transported to many locales in the oceans of the Northern Hemisphere. The two scientists invite Marine Watch readers to contact them with reports of any future finds of Nike shoes, bathtub toys, or other interesting drifting objects. <!-- Horizontal Line Tag -->
