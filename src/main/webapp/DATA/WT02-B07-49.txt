(1) Senate Passes Exon/Coats -- Battle Moves to House

The First Amendment was thrown out of cyberspace by the United States 
Senate today by a vote of 84 to 16 on passage of the Exon/Coats 
Communications Decency Act.

CDT remains adamantly opposed to this legislation, and we will continue 
to fight it as the bill moves to the House of Representatives. A House 
vote is expected in mid July.

In his effort to defeat the Exon amendment, Senator Leahy cited the 
over 35,000 signatures on the Internet petition, as well as the serious 
First Amendment and privacy concerns raised by the Exon proposal. 
Senator Feingold (D-WI) also spoke in opposition to the Exon amendment, 
and asked that the Senate consider the unique features of interactive media. 
Unfortunately, these efforts to protect the Internet from unnecessary and 
repressive censorship were not successful.

A full analysis of the Senate passed bill, as well as a description of 
the events that occurred today on the Senate floor will be posted in the 
next few days.
