MEDIA ARRANGEMENTS FOR CINP CONGRESS<BR>
<HR></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
Special arrangements have been made for the media to report the 20th congress
of the CINP (Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacolgicum) at the
World Congress Centre, Melbourne, from 23 to 27 June.<BR>
<BR>
Reporters and other media people are welcome to attend all the lectures,
forums, symposiums and other formal sessions of the congress. <BR>
<BR>
Although much of the information at these sessions is highly topical, it
will be presented in technical terms.<BR>
<BR>
The media may find it more convenient and rewarding to gain newsy material
for stories and feature articles and programs through interviews with some
of the 4000 psychiatrists and other medical experts attending the congress
from all around the world.<BR>
<BR>
Interview opportunities will be provided throughout the congress.<BR>
<BR>
Many of those attending the congress are international leaders in their
fields. They have agreed to talk to the media about their research and findings
and issues arising from their work.<BR>
THEIR expertise includes such areas as:<BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>*advances in the treatment of abuse of marijuana, alcohol, nicotine
and other drugs;<BR>
*the social cost (health services, loss of employment etc) of depression,
schizophrenia and other mental disorders;<BR>
*Alzheimer's disease;<BR>
*violence (in its individual manifestations and broader social effects -
eg, community trauma from bushfires and the Port Arthur massacre);<BR>
*phobias and anxiety disorders;<BR>
*eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and bulimia);<BR>
*gender differences in the incidence of mental disorders;<BR>
*mental health problems arising from HIV infection (AIDS);<BR>
*advances in ECT (electro-convulsive therapy) and brain surgery as treatments
for mental disorders.<BR>
*brain imaging (including PET - positron emission tomography)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
FROM 12.30 to 1.30pm on Monday 24 June (the first &quot;working day&quot;
of the congress) there will be a symposium on drugs, including marijuana
depression, a neuro-psychopharmalogical view.<BR>
<BR>
The symposium will be held in the John Batman Theatre at the World Congress
Centre and will be chaired by Professor Bruce Singh, head of the department
of psychiatry, Melbourne University, Royal Melbourne Hospital.<BR>
<BR>
Immediately after the symposium some of those who took part will give a
media conference.<BR>
<BR>
Among the panel of national and international experts expected to attend
will be Professor Fred Goodwin, director of the Centre on Neuroscience,
Behaviour and Society, Washington, DC, and a former director of the National
Institutes of Mental Health, the top US federal advisory agency on drugs.<BR>
<BR>
ALSO on Monday at 4pm in the Press Room there will be a media conference
on AIDS.<BR>
<BR>
This conference will provide information about the physiological and psychological
effects of drugs used in the treatment of AIDS and discuss the individual
and community costs and problems associated with caring for HIV-positive
people.<BR>
<BR>
Congress experts who maybe available for interview will include Professor
Igor Grant, department of psychiatry, University of California, San Diego;
Dr Bruce Brew, Sydney University/St Vincent's Hospital; Dr Floyd Bloom,
Scripps Institute, San Diego; and Professor Mario Maj, Milan University.<BR>
<BR>
MEDIA conferences and interviews on other days will be held at 4pm in the
Press Room located on the 2nd floor.<BR>
<BR>
Congress experts will be attending formal sessions throughout the day, and
4pm is the most convenient time for them to make themselves available. But
every effort will be made to fit in with members of the media who have special
requirements because of deadlines.<BR>
<BR>
Topics to be discussed at daily media conferences and interviews on Tuesday
25 June, Wednesday the 26th and Thursday the 27th are set out below.<BR>
<BR>
Each afternoon a media release will be issued. It will confirm the topics
to be discussed at the next day's media conference and list the experts
who will attend the conference and be available for interviews.<BR>
<H1>TOPICS</H1>
<BR>
TUESDAY: Many topics including alzheimer's disease; phobias; compulsive
behaviour; eating disorders; gambling; post-natal depression; alcoholism;
gender differences in mental health (why some disorders, though not apparently
hormonally related, are more prevalent among women or among men); alternatives
to drug therapy in the treatment of mental health problems such as panic
attacks and anxiety disorders.<BR>
<BR>
WEDNESDAY: Many topics including schizophrenia and depression. These are
the two most common of the more serious mental disorders.<BR>
<BR>
Schizophrenia, with its associated thought disorder delusions and hallucinations,
often affects people at the potentially most productive times of life. It
makes ordinary day-to-day living impossible for some sufferers, is expensive
in terms of social disruption and often leads to suicide, especially among
students and other young people.<BR>
<BR>
Similar problems are associated with depression.<BR>
<BR>
What new medications are available? What is the role of ECT (electro-convulsive
therapy)?<BR>
<BR>
THURSDAY: Many topics including violence in society; the treatment of trauma
victims (eg, affected by the Vietnam War, bushfires or such occurrences
as the Port Arthur massacre); brain surgery to the understanding of human
disorders; the relationship between aggression and neurochemical abnormalities;
genetic/hereditary propensity towards violence.<BR>
