<p><font size="4"><strong>Feasibility of a Cocaine Vaccine</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Source: PR Newswire</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">WALTHAM, Mass., Oct. 1, 1996 /PRNewswire/ via
Individual Inc. -- ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical Corporation (Nasdaq:
IMUL) today reported in Nature Medicine new research that
establishes the feasibility of a therapeutic vaccine for the
treatment of cocaine addiction. Company scientists and their
colleagues at Boston University demonstrated for the first time
that antibodies against cocaine can extinguish drug-seeking
behavior for cocaine in an animal model of addiction. The vaccine
that induces anti-cocaine antibodies was effective at minimizing
passage of cocaine into the brain in animals receiving
intravenous administration of cocaine, a route comparable to that
used by human abusers of the drug. The vaccine was also effective
against multiple doses of cocaine.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">ImmuLogic scientist and lead author of the
publication, Barbara Fox, Ph.D., commented, &quot;Our results
confirm the potential of a cocaine vaccine as a valuable new tool
in the treatment of cocaine addiction. To consider the vaccine
feasible for development as a human therapeutic, it was important
to show that the vaccine was effective when cocaine was
administered in a clinically relevant manner, that it modified
behavior, and that vaccine- induced antibody levels were
sufficient to minimize the passage of cocaine into the brain. We
are pleased to report that we have accomplished all of these
objectives, and plan to move this vaccine into the clinic in
1997.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Dr. Fox added, &quot;A cocaine vaccine will
provide a powerful new tool for the treatment of this serious
addiction. The vaccine is intended to be used in humans to
prevent relapse as part of a comprehensive treatment
program.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The U.S. Institute of Medicine estimates that
2.1 million people in the United States use cocaine on a weekly
basis, and several hundred thousand use it daily. Approximately
400,000 patients seek medical treatment for cocaine abuse on a
yearly basis in the U.S. Although there has been some success in
treating heroin and alcohol addiction by pharmacological and
behavioral means, no effective treatment currently exists for
cocaine addiction. The National Institute on Drug Abuse has
identified cocaine addiction as a life-threatening condition and
recently awarded ImmuLogic an SBIR grant to complete preclinical
development of the vaccine.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The ImmuLogic researchers first investigated
the ability of mouse anti- cocaine antibodies to inhibit
drug-seeking behavior in a model of addiction. In this model,
shown to accurately predict the likelihood that a drug will be
abused in humans, rats are trained to self-administer intravenous
doses of cocaine at will. Varying the dose of cocaine given to
the rats in each mission leads to a steep dose-response curve for
the animal's behavioral response to the drug and the rate of drug
infusion. In rats subsequently treated with anti-cocaine
antibodies, both the response rate and the infusion rate
decreased, but remain unaffected in rats receiving a control
antibody.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">ImmuLogic's cocaine vaccine consists of a
cocaine derivative chemically joined to a vaccine carrier
protein. The vaccine induced high titers of cocaine-specific
antibodies in mice, which persisted for months. Mice immunized
with the cocaine vaccine and then challenged with the drug showed
decreased levels of cocaine in their brains only 30 seconds after
intravenous administration of the drug. Repeat administration of
cocaine to immunized mice did not appear to alter the antibody's
beneficial effect on cocaine distribution.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Anti-cocaine antibodies induced in animals can
block the entry of cocaine into the brain and thus reduce the
ability of directly injected cocaine to increase motor
stimulation. Until now, however, questions remained whether this
approach could reduce drug-seeking behavior and thereby, the
drug's addictive potential. In addition, it remained unknown
until now whether the antibodies maintained their effect upon
repeated cocaine administration.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical Corporation is a
biopharmaceutical company, located in Waltham, Massachusetts,
developing peptide therapeutics to treat allergies and autoimmune
diseases. ALLERVAX(R) products to treat cat and ragweed allergies
are in clinical development. ImmuLogic's lead autoimmune
candidate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis is nearing
completion of preclinical development. In addition to treatments
for allergies and autoimmune diseases, the Company is developing
a poison ivy/poison oak therapeutic and a vaccine to treat
cocaine abuse.</font> </p>
