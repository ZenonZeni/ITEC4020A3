<blockquote>
<P>


<tt>By LAWRENCE H. TAYLOR, M.D.</tt><p>


	I expect many readers understand the problems produced by the restrictive nature of medical orthodoxy. I am unsure of the existence of a true conspiracy but I believe that conventional medicine is bound by research money and a 100-year old tradition of reliance on the pseudoscience of synthetic drugs. <p>
	This pseudoscience started off innocently enough as the germ theory proposed by Pasteur in the early 19th century, but it slipped into the search for magic bullets and the use of patented drugs. Since then, money and politics have retarded true progress in medicine and cost the lives of patients, as this story shows.<p>
	Sharon came to our clinic with metastatic breast cancer. Standard oncology treatments had failed, yet after two series of treatments by our methods, Sharon’s X-rays revealed that her cancer had stopped spreading to the bones. She gained weight, her appetite improved, and her pain was gone.<p>
	We had treated her with our alternative, multifactorial program and intravenous “Immunostim.” This is a nontoxic combination of ammonium compounds, phosphorus, and salts of silicate, all of which have been used in medicine for years. None are on the FDA’s restricted drugs list. In our studies, 80% of patients showed tumor shrinkage after taking Immunostim. <p>
	<b>MEDICAL POLITICS KILLS PATIENTS</b>. Yet the medical board and city police of San Diego raided and closed our offices. Meanwhile, Sharon’s oncologist called us for more Immunostim, but none was available. Despite petitions by Sharon’s attorney and oncologist to obtain more Immunostim, all requests were ignored.   Six months after our clinic was closed, Sharon died.<p>
	Obviously, no one can tell whether more Immunostim would have saved Sharon’s life. It is a crime that police action, illegal search-and-seizure methods, and political pressures halted the safe and legal use of compounds which have been used in mainstream medicine for years.  <p>
	<b>FAILURES OF CONVENTIONAL THERAPY</b>. Conventional medicine’s so-called treatments are failures, except in the case of a few rare cancers. Chemotherapy is effective against  only 7% of cancers. There has been no improvement in treatments, based upon longevity statistics, for over 30 years; millions of dollars and decades of experimentation have not produced a reliable system that cures cancer. <p>
	The promotion of chemotherapy constitutes medicine's most heinous fraud. Further, the science of medicine and especially cancer treatment has omitted or forgotten the human spirit as a fact of life and health, which is probably why it rigorously avoids the word “cure.”<p>
	<b>SCIENCE AT ODDS WITH PHYSIOLOGY</b>. Human physiology and the experimental methods currently in use are at serious odds. Trying to kill or destroy the cancer is the misguided basis of allopathic methods. Cancer research has been on the wrong trail in its search for a magic bullet. Using poisons as medicines is not the answer. There is overwhelming evidence that cancer is multifactorial. Therefore, no one single substance, poison, or “magic bullet” can cure it. <p>
	<b>INDIVIDUAL RESPONSE TO TREATMENT</b>. The medicine of the future will be concerned with maintaining and restoring good health. That is the goal of our treatment team. In my estimation, 60-80% of cancers are preventable. <p>
	We are concerned with a patient’s individual response to treatment and we are opposed to double-blind studies and tightly controlled research groupings where all patients are given the identical treatment. This approach ignores the facts of individual differences and how multiple treatments work together physiologically.	<p>
	<b>MALIGNANCIES CAN BE REVERSED</b>. Malignancies are diseases that are multifactorial and involve multiple body systems.  Local treatments to destroy cancers can be effective only  if the factors known to cause cancer are removed and if the body systems are working at their optimum level. For example, cancer of the breast is not limited to the breast. Even before it spreads, other organs and body systems are involved in its creation.  <p>
	<b>KEYS TO SUCCESSFUL TREATMENTS</b>. Almost all alternative cancer treatments are based upon nutrition, detoxification, and immune system support. Successful treatment should consider individual differences because persons with the same cell type may require different treatments, and vice versa. Identification of pathophysiological conditions and their causes is a fundamental aspect of successful cancer treatment. If this step is omitted, the factors that encouraged malignant change in the first place may continue to cause its recurrence.<p>
	<b>NUTRITION FOR BODY SYSTEMS</b>. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and fibers constitute the macronutrients. The most important medical fact concerning macronutrients is that by controlling the ratio of these foods in the diet the physician can control the most important hormone system in the body, the prostaglandins, which regulate inflammatory responses and pain control. <p>
	There are about 50 essential nutrients that must be provided in optimum doses and in forms easily absorbed by the body. These are the vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids, and fibers. <p>
	Chemotherapy destroys the ability of the intestines to absorb and assimilate these nutrients and also tends to destroy enzyme-producing cilia of the small intestine. Therefore, we check all our patients for bowel function. <p>
	<b>ELIMINATE ALL TOXINS</b>. Identifying and eliminating toxins is a standard procedure in our treatment. Free radicals are not often listed as toxins, but their presence in the body encourages cell damage and gene mutation. Heavy metal toxicity may be a factor inciting the development of cancerous growths. Testing hair, urine, blood, and teeth can help identify this problem. <p>
	The main organs of detoxification are the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and the intestines. Our treatments monitor and improve the function of these “waste management systems” through antioxidants, high  doses of ascorbic acid, and often EDTA chelation.<p>
	Chronic infections, especially those of the gums and teeth, interfere with healing cancer. Another proven source of internal toxins is the overgrowth of Candida, a common bowel fungus.  Bowel and systemic candidiasis are common after the excessive  use of antibiotics, corticosteroids, and chemotherapy. <p>
	<b>STRENGTHEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM</b>. Our research shows that nearly all types of cancer patients have abnormalities in several immune cells (specifically, T4, T8, and IL-2 leukocytes). The use of the drugs interferon and interleukins by oncologists is based upon the theory that strengthening the immune system will help the body fight the cancer. Clinical reports on those drugs have been disappointing, so we use nutritional and hormonal manipulations to support the immune system. <p>
 	<b>THE IMPORTANCE OF HOPE FOR HEALING</b>. Fear and depression often follow the standard diagnosis of cancer. The continued presence of these emotions stimulates the production of destructive hormones such as cortisone which, in turn, cause the cancer to spread. Unless the hope of healing is present, a downward destructive cycle is likely to take place.<p>
	False hope is the result of misinforming the patient. It occurs most frequently in the use of radiation and chemotherapy. First, the treatment does no good; second, it causes unnecessary side effects; and third, it is an expense which could be avoided. False hope can be prevented by giving the patient and family comprehensive information concerning treatment options, statistics regarding benefits and possible complications.<p>
 	<b>RESTORING THE ART OF MEDICINE</b>. Restoring the art of medicine to the treatment of cancer means restoring  compassion, faith, and healing. These powers may not be measurable by scientific methods, but they are real. Alternative medicine doctors use nontoxic multimodal therapies. These treatments cannot be “proven” successful using current scientific methods, but they do improve the quality of life.<p>
	The treatment program I’ve outlined here is one that supports good health. It may not be a “miracle” cure, but it is surely good medicine.<p>
