<H2>Select DSM Programs in Asia</H2>

<P><B>Australia:</B>
Utility DSM in Australia has a long history, with load control
programmes based on off peak tariffs and sophisticated load control
mechanisms commencing in the 1930s. Load reduction or energy efficiency
programmes commenced only in the late 1980s and are generally undertaken
as pilot programmes because Australia does not have regulatory
mechanisms in place to compensate utilities for lost revenue or the cost
of programmes. The most common form of DSM offered by the Australian
industry has been load controlled off peak water heating in the
residential sector. Other DSM technologies and measures include
lighting, appliance efficiency, appliance control, building design and
motors. The most common types of DSM Programmes are audits and
information and education programmes. Some use of rebates is now
commencing. The most significant energy efficiency programme offered by
industry to date has been the A$30 million Victorian programme which
offered rebates for electricity efficiency projects in industry and
business, and promoted cogeneration and renewable energy through an
incentives package. This programme has been discontinued with the
current emphasis on industry reform. At the present time a number of
utilities are engaging in DSM programmes to avoid transmission and
distribution investment, and some utilities have established energy
service companies to promote energy efficiency with their customers.</P>

<B>Japan:</B> Direct control of air conditioners and/or electric water
heaters and indirect control using rate incentives are being considered
at this time.</P>

<P><B>South Korea:</B> Korea's DSM programmes are in
the planning stages. Its primary delivery  agents and funding sources
are the utility and the government. The most common types of DSM
programmes are expected to be direct appliance control, standards and
rebates.</P>
