<STRONG>Feature-Rich, Permanent Life Insurance</STRONG><P>

We all have different financial needs and objectives.  But life insurance plays a fundamental
role in
most all our plans for financial security.  That's because of the variety of life insurance
plans available
and the many ways they can be used to meet unique needs at different periods of your
life.<P>
Whole Life insurance from New York Life is just such a feature-rich 
insurance
plan.  It
provides an income tax-free death benefit that can protect the financial security of your
family in the
event of an untimely death.  It offers tax-deferred cash values that, as they accumulate, can
be used to
help purchase a home, help pay for a child's education, or supplement retirement income.  Of
course,
you can also allow cash values to grow to help meet an unexpected emergency or seize an
unanticipated opportunity.<P>
But what's most important about Whole Life insurance is its versatility.  Like an umbrella,
it can help
buffer you and your family from life's storms.  But unlike an umbrella, Whole Life can expand
to provide
greater protection and cash value as your needs increase.  Various policy options allow you
to
purchase additional coverage over and above what the premium buys, thus simultaneously
building
cash value and death benefit; boost your coverage with term insurance; convert that term
insurance at a
later date into permanent Whole Life insurance; add family members to your policy; or even
guarantee
that premiums will continue to be paid should you become disabled.
<P>
<STRONG>Insurance for Your Whole Life</STRONG><BR>
Whole Life is permanent life insurance.  As long as premiums are paid on a timely basis, your
policy
can never be cancelled.  It's life insurance you'll always have. Once set, New York Life
guarantees that
your premiums will never increase.
<P>
<STRONG>Your Policy's Guaranteed Cash Values Build Over Time</STRONG><BR>
The value that builds in your Whole Life policy is called cash value.  Over the long term,
cash value
accumulation may be considerable, especially since taxes on the money's growth are deferred.
<P>
<STRONG>Your Policy May Also Earn Dividends</STRONG><BR>
In addition to guaranteed cash values, Whole Life insurance offers an additional potential
for growth. 
Because Whole Life is participating insurance, your policy is eligible for dividends if and
when they are
declared by the Company.  Each year the Company determines what portion of the profits, if
any, of life
insurance policies must be retained to build surplus and the balance that can be returned to
policyowners. This portion is returned in the form of dividends. Whole Life insurance
dividends are
considered a return of premium and are generally not taxable.  <P>
Dividends are yours to do with as you like.  You can use them to purchase paid-up additional
Whole Life
insurance or supplemental term insurance, repay policy loans, or you can take them in cash.
<P>
<STRONG>Versatility and Variety</STRONG><BR>
Since Whole Life premiums are based largely on age, they are typically lowest when the
insured
persons are youngest.  This makes Whole Life an excellent way to plan for the financial
future of
children and grandchildren.<P>
The versatility of Whole Life also makes it a prime candidate for meeting a variety of
business needs. 
You can use it to protect against the loss of key employees, to fund buy-sell agreements, or
ensure the
continuation of your business into its next generation.<P>
And that's not all.  Whole Life insurance can provide funds to preserve your assets for your
family during
estate settlement.  You can even use Whole Life to create a bequest for a favorite charity! 
Speak to your
New York Life agent today to learn more about the many ways you can use our Whole Life for
your
whole life.
