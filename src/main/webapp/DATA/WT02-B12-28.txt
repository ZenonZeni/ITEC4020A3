Re: CRYPTOGRAPHY: POLICY AND TECHNOLOGY TRENDS [ no surprises at this level. If anyone wants the text and can not ftp it, please send me a note .. djf] <p>

Actually, I did see a surprise at this level. <p>

&gt; Four potential scenarios are likely: mandatory escrowed encryption, voluntary
&gt; escrowed encryption, complete decontrol of encryption, or domestic decontrol
&gt; with strict export regulations. <p>

In the U.S., domestic use of cryptography is not controlled.  It
hasn't been controlled, and there's been absolutely no discussion of
imposing controls, except, of course, as a hypothetical idea needed to
make sense of the Clipper proposal.  ("If there's no prohibition of
non-Clipper cryptography, how can Clipper be successful?") <p>

Mandatory escrowed encryption is unlikely but hypothetically possible. <p>

"Domestic decontrol" is not a potential scenario because there's no
control in place now. <p>
