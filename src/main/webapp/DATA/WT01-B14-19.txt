The performance of the financial markets will also play an important role in the FOMC thinking. <B>If bond yields rise well above 7.0% while the stock market remains firm, more governors will be willing to tighten policy in order to restrain investors' inflation expectations</B>.  Conversely, if rising bond yields produce a large stock market correction, there will be more reluctance to tighten because of concern about household wealth losses.  The personal savings rate has begun to decline after rising sharply last year, but it could easily change direction if households become pessimistic about the economy because of  falling equity prices.
<P>

If the Federal Reserve does raise interest rates this summer, it will be the first G-7 central bank to break with the pattern of global easing which has prevailed since early 1995.  Japanese interest rates have fallen to such low levels that the next policy change has to be a rate hike, but such a hike is unlikely to occur until late this year because of the credit quality problems of the Japanese financial system.  Monetary policy in Germany is likely to remain easy because of the government's moves towards fiscal restraint, the weakness of the German economy, and the moral hazard problems created by the increasingly probable replacement of the D-mark by a new European currency in the year 1999.  Since Chancellor Kohl's coalition  won a decisive victory in the German lander elections during late March, both financial markets and European central bank officials have begun to assign a much higher probability to the introduction of a new European currency in the year 1999.  French bond yields have fallen sharply in relation to German bond yields while the German yield curve has remained positively sloped because of investor apprehension about the loss of  the D-mark.  Bundesbank officials have many doubts about the viability of a new European currency, but they cannot stop Chancellor Kohl from going forward unless there is some exogenous political shock which erodes his power.   <B>Instead of actively resisting the introduction of the Euro, many Bundesbank officials have decided to encourage a gradual devaluation of the D-mark in order to lessen the support of German industry for switching to a new European currency</B>.  As foreign investors own nearly 40% of Germany's public debt, the Bundesbank cannot push this devaluation strategy too far, but there is little doubt that they would be willing to accept a 10-15% decline against the U.S. dollar and the yen as well as smaller corrections against other European currencies.
<P>

The prospect of Germany and other European countries pursuing an easy monetary policy in order to weaken their currencies, coupled with the likelihood of Japanese monetary policy remaining on hold through the autumn, increases the possibility of a positive growth surprise occurring in the G-7 countries next year.  The easy monetary conditions in the G-7 countries are also reviving capital flows to the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Africa and thus increasing the odds that they will enjoy stronger recoveries as well.  A few developing countries, such as Malaysia and Thailand, are raising interest rates in order to constrain domestic inflation pressures, but they are still likely to experience growth rates in excess of 7.0%.  The Yeltsin government is pursuing such populist fiscal policies in order to win the upcoming Russian presidential election, it will certainly have to reverse course if it wins, but the emergence of a large private sector in Russia should still permit positive output growth in the future after a long period of contraction.  After three years of tightening monetary policy in order to restrain inflation, China also has begun to relax monetary policy during recent days.  On  May 1st, it announced a reduction in the cost of working capital loans from 12.06% to 10.98%.  These interest rate adjustments also followed a selective easing of credit rationing policies late last year.  If we measure GDP on the basis of purchasing power parity adjustments to compensate for price differentials, Europe accounts for about 25% of world output, the U.S. for about 22%, Japan for about 9%, and China for about 8%.  <B>Monetary policy has therefore shifted towards an expansionary direction in about two-thirds of the world economy during the past four quarters and the shift is not yet completed in several countries</B>.  This monetary policy bias suggests that the world economy will become increasingly buoyant during the next six quarters, even if the U.S. economy enjoys only a moderately positive sub-cycle recovery during the second half of 1996.  As a result, <B>the IMF is predicting 4.3% growth in world output during 1997 compared to 3.8% this year, and 3.5 % in 1999</B>.
<P>

To summarize, the surprising resilience of final demand in the first quarter is provoking new discussion about Fed tightening  during the summer, but the FOMC is unlikely to support such tightening unless it sees clear evidence that output growth will remain above 2.5% on a sustained basis and industrial commodity prices start to rise more sharply.  The best leading indicators of a monetary policy change will be the performance of the purchasing agent price index, retail sales, and the bond market.  The generally accommodative tone of monetary policy in Europe and Japan suggests that the odds are increasing of a positive growth surprise in the world economy during 1997 and 1998.
