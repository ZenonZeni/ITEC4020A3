Dear Brother Olsen, <BR>
<DD>I am writing this letter to you to ask that more information
about my Father's first Family, The Coptic Church, be sent to me by mail
at 600 Lindsay Ave., Sacramento, CA 95838, under the name of Christopher
Harrison.&nbsp; I would also like to thank you for your work, which without I may never have been brought back to knowing my Father.&nbsp; For as long as I can remember, I have been studying the Bible (King James and various translations of it), trying to understand Him.&nbsp; Growing up in the Baptist Church (offspring of the orignial falsity, The Catholic Church), I had been taught, along with the rest of the lost spirits, that my Father is a mystery; and that He always will be a mystery to me.&nbsp; This ignorance has led me to believe in the status quo (evil), leading me into the life- (actually death-) time pursuit of being a lawyer.&nbsp; I had applied to law schools, thinking that, upon acceptance, I would be completed &amp; happy.&nbsp; (This went along with the belief that this was the sky God's will.)&nbsp; It was not until some days ago that I realized that this sky god is actually Satan, trying to lead me astray.&nbsp; <BR><DD>It was at this point that I realized the Light, and knew that I could not remain sinless in this world.&nbsp; I knew that Goud was real, and that my spirit needs to return to be among the Brethren, the Coptics.&nbsp; <BR>
<DD>I came to the Truth after months of prayer and sacrifice,
leading me to search for <A HREF="../../"> your page</A> on the Internet.&nbsp; When I first read it, I was convinced that there was truth in it; but it was not until I continued the search that I was able to confirm that it was all Truth through reading the passages of our forefathers (the Essenes and the Gnostics).&nbsp; It was during this time that I knew it was time for me to return to the ways of my Father.<BR>
<DD>As you may well understand, I am full yet not satisfied, in
want yet I have everything.&nbsp; I write to you because I now know what work my Father has for me: not to study the laws and precepts of those spirits who are bound by Satan, but to study the laws and ways of my ancestors.&nbsp; In this, I may continue towards knowledge and carry on His works.&nbsp; <BR><DD>So that I may begin my tutorship as soon as possible, I ask that your Honor would contact me immediately at (510) 631-3267.&nbsp; <BR>
<DD>Giving Honor and Praises to our <BR>
<DD>Most High, the Inner Spirit, our <BR>
<DD>Eternal Source of Life.&nbsp; <BR>
<DD>Your Servant and Brother <BR>
<DD>Forever, <BR>
<DD>Christopher Harrison </FONT></TT>
