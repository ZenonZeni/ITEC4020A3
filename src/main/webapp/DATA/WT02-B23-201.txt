<H3>Children At Risk: Early Intervention and Prevention of Reading and
Written Language Disabilities, S.P.I.R.E.(tm) (Specialized Program Individualizing
Reading Excellence) </H3>

<P><B>Sheila Clark-Edmands</B>, M.S.Ed., Progress Learning, Inc., Kennebunk,
ME </P>

<P>The presentation will discuss S.P.I.R.E.(tm), an early intervention
Reading and Language Arts K-Middle School program, developed and used for
high risk learners beginning in Grade One within the regular classroom.
Information will be presented on early identification, specific teaching
techniques, curriculum scope and sequence, classroom management and teaching
materials. </P>

<H3>Building Self Esteem Through Positive Discipline </H3>

<P><B>Margery Rieff, Ph.D.</B>, Wilmette, IL <BR>
<B>Peggy Miller, M.A.</B>, Highland Park, IL </P>

<P>Discipline should not be used as a weapon. The term is not interchangeable
with punishment. Without discipline, children would find themselves isolated
and unable to make reliable predictions about their environment. Discipline
enables children to develop autonomy as well as relationships with those
around them. The presenters will demonstrate how to establish a safe, predictable
environment that provides esteem building messages to children with behavioral
challenges. </P>

<H3>The &quot;At-Risk&quot; Child in Early Childhood: <BR>
Signs of Learning Disabilities Identification and Intervention </H3>

<P><B>Kathryn Fouks</B>, M.S.Ed., The Achievement Centers, La Grange Highlands,
IL <BR>
<B>Connie Parr</B>, LDA National Board Member, Oswego, IL </P>

<P>This presentation will introduce typical and atypical develop-ment of
children, ages two through six, across the domains of cognitive, language,
motor, self-help, and personal/social functioning. A growing number of
children are at-risk for developmental disabilities and in need of intervention
services due to advances in medical technology, the growing impact of poverty,
and the biological and environmental effects of substance-abusing parents.
A history of at-risk children will be presented. The steps that may be
taken to obtain the background of the at-risk child in early childhood
will be clarified. The importance of medical reports, direct observations,
developmental and behavioral rating charts, and information from the home
will be outlined. Participants will learn to identify areas of learning
disabilities and corresponding intervention strategies and activities.
Participants will learn to identify conditions which may cause the Young
Child to be “At-Risk” as well as ways to talk to parents about concerns.

<H2>Every Child is Learning: <BR>
A Training Project for Early Care Providers </H2>

<P><B>Sheldon H. Horowitz, Ed.D.</B>, NCLD, New York, NY <BR>
<B>David Fleishman</B>, NCLD, New York, NY </P>

<P>This project is a valuable in-service training tool for early care providers.
Viewing videotape segments and engaging in guided discussion, teachers,
parents and paraprofessionals are helped to be better observers/recorders
of behavior, to appreciate the developmental learning process and to identify
risks and warning signs of later learning disabilities. </P>

<H3>Quantitative Skills in Infants and Preschool Children </H3>

<P><B>Susan Levine, Ph.D.</B>, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL <BR>
<B>Janellen Huttenlocher, Ph.D.</B>, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL
<BR>
<B>Kelly Mix</B>, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL </P>

<P>This session will be concerned with the development of young children’s
quantitative skills. Strong claims have been made about abstract concepts
of number that begin in infancy. Evidence from studies that are relevant
to such claims will be discussed. These studies delineate what infants
and preschoolers do and do not understand about number. These experiments
address early notions of numerosity as well as the ability to carry out
addition and subtraction operations on whole numbers and fractional amounts.
One premise of this research is that gaining a better picture of early
quantitative skills in preschool children will help educators teach the
mathematical conventions that map onto these skills. </P>

<H3>Preventing Reading Disabilities: <BR>
Phonological Awareness Activities for Kindergarten </H3>

<P><B>Mary R. Eisele</B>, Ph.D., University of South Florida, Ft. Myers,
FL <BR>
<B>Holly B. Lane</B>, Ph.D., University of Florida, Gainesville, FL <BR>
<B>Marsha Harper</B>, Irby Elementary School, Alachua, FL <BR>
<B>Karen Morey</B>, Irby Elementary School, Alachua, FL </P>

<P>Kindergarten teachers may prevent later reading failure for many of
their students by incorporating phonological awareness instruction into
their emergent literacy curriculum. The role of phonological awareness
instruction in a kindergarten literacy program will be described. Techniques
for phonological awareness assessment and intervention will be presented
and demonstrated. </P>

<H3>Strategies Which Promote Social Skills in Young At-Risk Children </H3>

IL <BR>
<B>Elizabeth Landerholm, Ed.D.</B>, Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago,
IL <BR>
<B>Suzanne Smith, M.A.</B>, Tuesday's Child, Chicago, IL</P>

<P>This presentation will review strategies which can be implemented by
teachers in inclusive settings to promote social skills in at-risk young
children. First general strategies are described. Then specific strategies
used at Tuesday's Child, a preschool in Chicago, are explained. Last, techniques
emphasized in Japanese kindergartens are presented. </P>
