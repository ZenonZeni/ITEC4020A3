<P>Product finishing is an energy and environmentally intensive 
manufacturing service. Yet, to our knowledge, there are no measures of 
operational efficiency for energy, environment or manufacturing. There is no scale 
to determine how well individual companies are doing over 
time or relative to other finishers.
<P>In part, this is due to a wide-spread belief that each finisher is unique 
and cannot be compared to other finishers. It is a fairly complex problem 
to figure out how to collect and analyze data that would allow companies 
to compare themselves with others in the industry. Issues like 
proprietary concerns and confidentiality have to be 
addressed in order to get companies to provide the information necessary to make performance 
comparisons possible.
<P>For an industry that is heavily influenced by changes in 
environmental regulations and energy markets, monitoring performance relative to 
others ought to be a priority. Otherwise, finishers may assume too much and end 
up playing catch-up every year. ITI's surveys have found that 
companies have a consistently inflated opinion of how well they perform relative to others in 
their industry. Half of all metal fabricators surveyed rated themselves in the top 
10 pct on measures like quality and productivity.
<P>Now, product finishers have a source of information to use for 
evaluating their industry performance. The <I>Performance Benchmarking Service 
</I>of ITI (Industrial Technology Institute) in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with the help of a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) project, surveyed the product finishing industry. The results of the survey are the subject of another article. Through this <I>Products Finishing 
</I>article we want to bring to large numbers of metal finishers a convenient, confidential way to self-evaluate their operations in the energy, environment and manufacturing areas using the following 16-question <I>EEM Self-Assessment Tool for Metal Product Finishers.</I>
<P>As a product finisher, do you know your company's strengths and 
weaknesses? Do you know how much you spend on energy per month, or on 
waste treatment and disposal? More importantly, are there areas where you 
think you lag behind your competition? Understanding which areas positively 
and negatively impact your productivity and profitability 
helps with improvement.
<P>The <I>EEM Self Assessment Tool for Metal Product Finishers 
</I>is self-contained. You provide the answers and the answer key provides your 
status among metal finishers in the three critical areas of your business: 
energy efficiency, environmental management and manufacturing performance. 
Even if you know your business well, you can still use this self-assessment tool 
to compare and track your company's performance changes over time.
<P><B>The EEM Self-Assessment Quiz. </B>Product finishing companies from 
all regions of the country completed an extensive survey covering all aspects 
of their business operations. The data are updated regularly as new 
questionnaires are completed. All company names and identifying data are 
strictly confidential to ensure the data is accurate. 
<P>The finishing industry is well represented, with more than 100 
respondents used to develop the tool. Seventy-eight pct of 
companies participating in the survey were product 
finishers. Twenty-two pct of the companies were 
primarily metal coaters. Of the product finishers, most engaged in a wide variety 
of plating processes: 60 pct plated primarily chrome and 
cadmium; 38 pct plated primarily nickel, copper and trivalent 
chrome; and 15 pct plated primarily tin, zinc and/or aluminum. Only two pct plated precious metals.
<P>Circle one answer for each question. The Answer and Evaluation 
key follow. Information is provided with the questions to explain why they 
were selected.

<H2>Manufacturing Performance</H2>
<P><B>1. Percent Change in Sales over Past Two Years.</B>
<P>Sales have been increasing throughout in the product finishing 
industry. Sales growth is often a requirement for improved margins. Percentage 
change in sales equals 1994 sales, minus 1992 sales, divided by 1992 sales. 
Where do you stand? Circle only one.
<P>(A) <I>68% or more</I> <BR>
(B)<I> 41 - </I>67% <BR>
(C) <I>21 - </I>40% <BR>
(D) <I>3 - 20% </I> <BR>
(E)<I> Less than 3%</I>

<P><B>2. Training, Tuition and Fees per Employee.
<P> </B>Money invested in employee training can result in savings in the future, 
due to increased worker efficiency and productivity. To determine how 
many employees you have, use your average for the year (not year end counts) 
and convert part-time and contract labor to full-time equivalents. Training 
dollars include all in-house training costs and any employee tuition and fees 
for external training. How much do you spend annually?
<P>(A) <I>$501 or more </I><BR>
(B)<I> $221 - $500</I><BR>
(C) <I>$75 - $220 </I><BR>
(D)<I> $28 - $74 </I><BR>
(E)<I> Less than $28</I>

<P><B>3. Value-Added per Employee.
<P> </B>This is the single most important measure of worker productivity. It 
represents the value of the work that is performed at your shop by you, 
your employees and equipment. Companies with higher value-added also 
have higher profit margins. To determine your purchased materials costs, 
include the cost of purchased materials, parts and services (including utilities 
and phone) in the past year. Do not include payments to agencies for 
temporary workers, shop labor costs, or any rent, depreciation, interest or capital 
costs. Your value is:
<P>(A)<I> $77,395 or more </I><BR>
(B)<I> $60,706 - $77,394 </I><BR>
(C) <I>$47,100</I> <I>- $60,705 </I><BR>
(D)<I> $35,126 </I>-<I> $47,099 </I><BR>
(E<I>) Less than $35,126</I>

<P><B>4. Percent of Parts Reworked.
<P> </B>The need to rework parts can significantly eat into your profits. No 
company is without rework; some just have less rework than others. How does 
your company compare?
<P>(A) 0.<I>35% or less </I><BR>
(B)<I> 0.36 - </I>1%<BR>
(C) <I>1.1</I> <I>- 3</I>%<BR>
(D) <I>3.1</I> <I>- 5</I>%<BR>
(E)<I> More than 5%</I>

<P><B>5. Percent of Lots or Jobs 
<P>Rejected by Customers for Quality Reasons.</B>
<P>When customers reject lots, your company loses more than just time 
and money, it loses credibility. Percentage lots rejected equals lots 
rejected, divided by total lots produced, times 100. What is your lot reject rate?
<P>(A) <I>0</I>.<I>05% or less </I><BR>
(B) <I>0</I>.<I>06 - 0.</I>5% <BR>
(C) <I>0.51 </I>- 1%, <BR>
(D) <I>1.1</I> <I>- 2</I>%, <BR>
(E) <I>More than 2%</I>

<P><B>6. Percent of On-Time Deliveries to Your Customers. </B>
<P>With sales growing as quickly as they are in the product finishing 
industry, on-time delivery has become increasingly problematic for many 
companies. On-time deliveries are those made within the customer's specified 
on-time window. How did you do? 
<P>(A) <I>99% or more </I><BR>
(B<I>) 96 - 98.9% </I><BR>
(C)<I> 90 - </I>95.9% <BR>
(D) <I>80 - 89.9% </I><BR>
(E) <I>Less than 80%</I>

<P><B>7. Percent of Jobs Expedited. </B>How often do you bump scheduled 
jobs in order to make up for delays? Better scheduling and tracking of your 
jobs can reduce the need for expediting, saving you and your customers 
headaches. What percentage of jobs do you have to expedite?
<P>(A) <I>3.2% or less </I><BR>
(B)<I> 3.3 - </I>7.5% <BR>
(C) 7.6 <I>- 15%</I> <BR>
(D) <I>15.1</I> <I>- 33% </I><BR>
(E)<I> More than 33%</I>

<H2>Energy and Environmental Performance</H2>
<P>8. Annual Natural Gas Use (ccf) per Sq Ft of Production Area.</B>
<P>Natural gas is primarily used for space heating in the product 
finishing industry. Regional variation is expected, but if your company's gas use 
is unusually high, you may have some opportunity for savings. Divide 
your total annual gas consumption in ccf by production area sq ft. Your value is:
<P>(A) <I>4 ccf or less </I><BR>
(B)<I> 5 - 20 ccf </I><BR>
(C) <I>21</I> <I>- 93 ccf </I><BR>
(D)<I> 94 - 204 ccf</I> <BR>
(E) <I>204+ ccf</I>

<P><B>9. Total Annual Electricity Use in Kilowatt Hours per 
$100,000 in Sales. </B>
<P>Companies that use electricity in their processes, such as anodizers, 
rank relatively high on energy usage. However, a high use rate that cannot 
be easily explained may indicate reduction in electricity use is possible. 
Divide your total sales by $100,000 to get per $100,000 units, next 
divide annual electricity use (kWh) by that per $100K unit figure. Your value is:
<P>(A) <I>1 kWh or less </I><BR>
(B)<I> 1.1</I> <I>- 2 kWh</I><BR>
(C) 2.1 <I>- 4 kWh </I><BR>
(D<I>)</I> 4.1 <I>- 5 kWh </I><BR>
(E)<I> 5+ kWh</I>

<P><B>10. Total Annual Energy Costs as a Percent of 
Sales. </B>
<P>Energy costs can have a significant impact on your net. Might your 
company benefit from greater energy efficiency? Divide your total costs 
for energy (gas and electric) by your total sales times 100. Your percent 
value is:
<P>(A) <I>2.08% or less </I><BR>
(B)<I> 2.09</I> -<I> 3.24%</I><BR>
(C)<I> 3.25</I> <I>- 5.36% </I><BR>
(D)<I> </I>5.37 <I>- 6.73% </I><BR>
(E) <I>6.73%</I>

<P><B>11. Cubic Yards of Solid Sludge Generated per $100,000 
in Sales. </B>
<P>Companies can reduce their sludge volume by modifying their 
processes. The total cubic yards of sludge of each company is adjusted so it does 
not include the water left in the sludge, which controls the variation in 
the percent of sludge that is solid. Obtain this value by taking percent of 
sludge<B>, </B>multiply into total sludge generated, divide the result by the total 
sales, finally divide by 100,000. Your value is:
<P>(A) <I>0 yards </I><BR>
(B<I>) 0.01</I> - <I>0.40 yds </I><BR>
(C) <I>0.41 - 2.22 yds </I><BR>
(D)<I> 2.23 - 5.30 yds <BR>
</I>(E)<I> 5.30+</I> <I>yds</I>

<P><B>12. Gallons of Water Used per $100,000 in 
Sales. </B>
<P>The costs associated with water use (especially utility and sewage bills) 
are often overlooked. Your value is:
<P>(A)<I> 36,108 gal or less </I><BR>
(B)<I> 36,109 - 97,222 gal </I><BR>
(C) <I>97,223 - 213,020 gal </I><BR>
(D) <I>213,021 - 427,000 gal </I><BR>
(E)<I> 427, 000+ gal</I>

<P><B>13. Gallons of Solvents Used per $100,000 in Sales.
<P> </B>Solvents are halogenated, non-halogenated, mineral spirits and ter-<BR>
penes. Decreasing solvent use is one key method of reducing disposal 
costs. Is your company using more solvents than the industry average? Your 
value is:
<P>(A) <I>18 gal or less </I><BR>
(B)<I> 19 - 99 gal </I><BR>
(C) <I>100 - 588 gal </I><BR>
(D)<I> 589 - 2,689 gal </I><BR>
(E)<I> 2,689+ gal</I>

<P><B>14. Hazardous Waste Disposal Costs per $100,000 in 
Sales. </B>
<P>Reducing the amount of waste generated by implementing process changes 
and pollution prevention strategies makes long-term business sense.
<P>(A)<I> $0 </I><BR>
(B)<I> $1 - $135 </I><BR>
(C)<I> $136</I> <I>- $545 </I><BR>
(D<I>) $546 - $1,167 </I><BR>
(E<I>) $1,167+</I>

<P><B>15. Total Direct Environmental Costs as a Percent of Sales.</B>
<P>Reducing the amount of hazardous waste generated reduces disposal 
and environmental compliance costs. Direct environmental costs include 
total waste disposal costs (hazardous and non-hazardous); on-site waste 
treatment costs, including an estimate of labor and materials as well as 
depreciation of waste treatment equipment; and labor and service costs 
associated with environmental compliance, such as regulatory fees, lab costs, 
legal fees, and compliance-related labor costs.
<P>(A) <I>0.9% or less </I><BR>
(B)<I> 0.</I>1 <I>- 2</I>% <BR>
(C) <I>2.1</I> <I>- 3.9% </I>(D)<I> 4 - </I>7.5% <BR>
(E)<I> More than 7.5%</I>

<P><B>16. Does Your Company Have a Formal Waste 
Reduction Program? </B>
<P>(A)<I> Yes </I>(B)<I> No</I>


<P>Use the answer key to translate your answers into an overall rating 
relative to other companies. Give yourself the indicated number of points relative 
to your answer.

<P><B>Performance Evaluation: How Well is your Company Performing? </B>
<P>Please note that each measure is sorted independently from the others. No 
one company scores well on every section covered. The purpose of this EEM 
Self Assessment is not to provide a detailed inventory of all of your 
company's processes, but to give you an idea of where you stand in relation to 
other product finishing companies.
<P><B>Manufacturing Score Evaluation.</B> Your total score for questions 1 
through 7 was:
<P><B>27+</B> points. Excellent. Yours is one of the leading 
companies in the field. You will want to review the areas where you scored low, but overall 
your shop is effective and efficient.
<P><B> 16-26 </B>points. Good Job. Though you scored poorly on a few 
questions, your performance is above the industry average on most measures. 
Keep your eyes open for improvement opportunities that can make the 
difference between a good company and an excellent one.

<P><B> 0-15 </B>points. Room for Improvement. You are probably doing things 
the same way you have for years. A plant-wide analysis could help you 
determine where changes are most needed. Investing some time and money 
into improvements can greatly increase your profit margin and ensure that 
your company stays competitive into the next century.
<P><B> Energy and Environment Score Evaluation. 
</B>If your total score for questions 8 through 16 was: 
<P><B>24+ </B>points. Excellent. Yours is one of the leading companies in the 
field. You will want to review areas where you scored low.
<P><B> 10-23 </B>points. Good Job. Even though you may have scored poorly on 
a few questions, your performance is above the industry average on 
most measures. Yet you need to address those issues to go from being good 
to excellent.
<P><B>0-9 </B>points. Room for Improvement. Your operations require more 
energy efficiency as well as increased environmental awareness. A plant-wide 
analysis could help you determine where changes in your operations are most needed.
<P><B>Overall Score Evaluation. </B>If your grand total for questions 1 through 
16 was: 
<P><B>51</B>+<B> </B>points. You are an industry leader! Maintain that house of 
quality culture!
<P><B>26-50 </B>points. You are better than the average firm! Can easily 
excel through continuous improvement!
<P><B>0-25 </B>points. You lag! Many opportunities to improve, re-engineer 
and perform!</P>

<H2>Where to go from here?</H2>

<P>Now that you have completed the test, what to do? If you are an industry leader, you should maintain that lead. If certain aspects of your operations require improvements, you can start to plan those changes. Consider this self-test as a first-step towards a preventive maintenance procedure or the start of a business improvement process.
