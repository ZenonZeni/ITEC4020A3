<IMG SRC="puffin.gif" ALT="puffin.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=210>It looked like just another casualty of life, a hapless corpse, partially decomposed, lying face down on the summit of the magical Flannan Isles. Most of us walked past, hardly aware of the fallen figure, so mesmerized were we by the countless thousands of puffins and others, a mere arm's length from our camera lenses.<BR>
The fallen figure did not, however, escape the attention of Karen Barraclough, one of our spellbound adventurers on last June's <B>`Round Britain</B> voyage. Karen had noticed that the dead puffin was tagged with a small aluminum band bearing the serial number EB31213. This was duly sent off to the appropriate authorities; the results became a piece of ornithological history and added another piece of mosaic in the private life of the puffin.<BR>
The puffin had been banded by Mike Harris, a personal friend of Peter Harrison, in June of 1975. This made the puffin 21 years and 1 month old - the second oldest puffin ever recorded (the oldest known puffin was 21 years and 3 months old). If you would like to conduct your own puffin hunt, be sure to sign up early for our 1998 <B>`Round Britain</B> adventure.<BR>
