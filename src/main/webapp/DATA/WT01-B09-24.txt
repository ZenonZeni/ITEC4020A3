<BLOCKQUOTE>
 New Jersey — New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman – marking a new direction for her state – will be directing the New Jersey Transit agency to begin replacing its diesel buses with natural gas-powered buses, reports the Tri-State Transportation Campaign’s newsletter. Whitman wants 50 "cruiser buses," or long- versus short-distance buses, and plans a fast-fueling terminal in Howell, Monmouth County, within two years as part of the $35 million project. Clean-air proponents say New Jersey had been reluctant – despite mounting evidence of diesel exhaust’s unhealthy effects – to do anything about the problem. Natural gas-powered vehicles (NGVs) emit about 90 percent fewer emissions than diesel-powered models, and many fleets report fuel-cost savings of up to 40 percent (News Notes 8/20/96). To further cut emissions, the state is expanding its random roadside inspection program to include fines; more than 20 percent of vehicles tested failed.
