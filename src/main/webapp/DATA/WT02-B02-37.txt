<p><font size="4">Beyond Prohibition</font><font size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">2. Steps To Harm Reduction<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Our existing drugs policy, grounded in
prohibition, is failing. Drug use continues at significant
levels, the drug trade continues to flourish, and the social
consequences of a thriving drugs black market - including
significant property crime and police corruption - continue to
cause concern.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We need to continue the process begun a decade
ago with the introduction of legal needle and syringe exchanges.
That is, we need to continue to shift the primary policy focus
from prohibition to harm reduction: to rely less on the criminal
law to discourage drug use and supply, and more on education,
treatment and research to make drug use as safe and responsible
as possible. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Our current approach to drugs confuses legal
status with questions of safety. Both alcohol and marijuana are
widely used in social situations, both methadone and heroin are
highly addictive, both Prozac and ecstasy induce comparable
feelings of well-being. Yet the differing legal status of each of
these drugs skews social attitudes to their appropriate use, and
distorts accurate education messages about their effects and the
dangers of misuse.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There is a limit to the constructive harm
reduction measures which can be undertaken without changes to the
law. We have probably already reached the point at which the laws
criminalising drug use represent a real impediment to programmes
aimed at minimising the personal and social harm which can be
caused by drug use. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Reducing Drug-related Harm</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Harm reduction means aiming at reducing the
harm that drugs can cause to users and to the broader community.
It involves accepting that drug use will never be eliminated,
even if we do not approve of it. Harm reduction should be the
standard against which we measure the success or failure of
existing drug laws, and proposals for change.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Redfern Legal Centre has proposed that in the
long term, we should implement a system of controlled
availability for most currently illicit drugs. The Centre's Harm
Reduction Model of Controlled Drug Availability sets out
principles for controlled availability which would produce the
greatest degree of harm reduction, and sketches some case studies
to illustrate what these principles might mean in practice.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">In the immediate future, we should take some
less dramatic steps towards reducing drug related harm. Here we
outline some immediate steps we should take to implement harm
reduction principles in the short term.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Policy Objectives</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Although drugs policy could never be described
as uncontroversial, there is some common ground. Most would agree
that drugs policy should be framed in the context of health
objectives and social policy, not with the criminal law as the
starting point. Where drug use is problematic, it should be
addressed as a health issue, not a legal issue.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">What does this mean in concrete terms?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The changes we recommend here address what we
consider to be the most significant drug policy issues impacting
on public health. The particular objectives of the proposals made
here are </font></p>

<p><font size="2">1. To establish the legal environment for the
implementation of effective education and other health programs
to:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">reduce overdose deaths</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">reduce the number of new Hepatitis C infections
associated with injecting drug use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">at least maintain (and if possible reduce)
existing low levels of new HIV infection through injecting drug
use</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">improve the level of responsible disposal of
used needles</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">2. Reduce socially harmful impact of criminal
justice system on users of currently illicit drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Taking the steps detailed below will not solve
all the problems associated with drug use. Change to the existing
legal framework must of necessity be made gradually. Once the
proposals for change outlined here are implemented and evaluated,
we can consider what further changes to drug law and policy are
necessary.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">These measures would have only a small initial
impact on crime rates and police corruption. These social harms
result directly from the drug laws particularly laws about drug
supply. We need to move towards greater regulation of the drugs
market to enable us as a society to influence the size and
operation of the drugs market. Achieving the maximum public
health benefits will require regulatory control over matters such
as purity, weight, recommended dosages, and labelling.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The greatest source of social harm associated
with drugs is the black market. The black market, with its
extraordinary profits, fuels police corruption, and generates
property crime. And the black market is an unregulated market,
with no controls on drug quality, multiplying the dangers of drug
use. The enormous profits to be made will always draw a steady
stream of new entrepreneurs to the production and distribution of
drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The size of the black market is determined by
the laws we make about drug supply. While it is likely that we
will never be able to completely eliminate the drugs black
market, changes to the legal approach to drugs can reduce and
marginalise the negative social impact of a contracted illicit
market.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We must explore alternative strategies to
control the size of the black market, including considering
alternative changes to the law about supply. But we cannot
sensibly undertake that consideration without first resolving
legal and policy issues about use and possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Each of the measures outlined below would
represent an important step on the way to creating the legal
framework for a comprehensive harm reduction strategy.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">1 . Personal Use and Possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Penalising drug users for the activity of drug
use does little if anything to discourage drug-taking.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Criminalising drug using behaviour adds to the
social and personal burden on drug users without any
corresponding social benefit. The current laws force drug use
underground, compounding health problems and making it more
difficult to implement effective public health programs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police drugs strategy states that police
resources should be directed towards drug traffickers and
large-scale suppliers, rather than drug users. However, the fact
is that 60% of drug matters prosecuted involve drug use or
possession offences.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because there is a distinct socioeconomic bias
in the manner in which different communities are policed, there
is a differential outcome in how these charges are laid. This
means that the drug laws impact unfairly on the poor, the
homeless, Aborigines and the young - disproportionately to their
actual patterns of usage.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Changing our approach to the legal treatment of
drug use would assist in HIV/Hepatitis C prevention by allowing
injecting drug users to access (and dispose of) new needles and
syringes without fear of police harassment. It would also remove
existing disincentives for drug users (such as marijuana smokers)
to openly discuss their use with doctors and other health
professionals. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are a number of constructive alternatives
to the criminalisation of personal use and possession of drugs.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The options are to:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">a. abolish the offences of use and possession;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">b. abolish the offence of self administration
only; and/or</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">c. vary enforcement practices</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We will briefly discuss the merits of these
alternative approaches.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option a. Abolish the offences of use and
possession </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The most straightforward solution is to remove
the offence of drug using and possession. That is, it would no
longer be a criminal offence to use an illicit drug, nor to
possess a small quantity for personal use (say 30 grams for
cannabis, 1 gram for heroin, amphetamine and other powders). In
order to minimise the number of cannabis users accessing the
black market, cultivation of up to five cannabis plants per
household should also be allowed. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Removing these offences would remove the legal
obstacle to drug users seeking appropriate health care, including
the estimated 600,000 cannabis users in this State. It would
reduce fear of police harassment by injecting drug users
accessing needle and syringe exchanges and, especially,
contribute to responsible disposal of used needles. Because
possession of a used needle is evidence of the offence of drug
use, the law currently creates incentives to dispose of used
needles quickly rather than thoughtfully.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Removing these offences would be consistent
with existing police strategy which states that police resources
should be directed towards drug traffickers, not drug users.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option b. Abolish the offence of self
administration only</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Because drug use (&quot;self
administration&quot;) and drug possession are separate offences
under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act, it is possible to
remove the offence of use without any change to the law
prohibiting drug possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Removing the criminality of the act of using a
drug would improve the capacity of educators and researchers to
communicate in direct and plain terms with people about their
past and present levels of drug use, and use behaviours.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In practical terms, it would mean that a person
who had recently consumed a drug but had no other drugs in their
possession, would be not subject to arrest or criminal charges.
This would encourage larger numbers of injecting drug users to
responsibly dispose of used needles and syringes, positively
contributing to reduction in new HIV and hepatitis infections,
and to community perceptions of public safety.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Most self administration convictions result
from the person admitting having consumed a drug, without other
evidence (blood or urine tests are not undertaken to support
these charges). This law is selectively enforced against those
who are most vulnerable and least aware of their civil rights
(especially the right to silence).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If the self administration provision is
withdrawn, there would remain ample legal power for the police to
control offensive or anti-social behaviour which might accompany
drug use. Appropriate community policing strategies would address
community concerns about unacceptable behaviour in public places
by people under the influence of illicit drugs, while also
achieving desirable public health and social equity results.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option c. Vary enforcement practices</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The alternative to legislative amendment is to
change how these laws are enforced. There are several ways in
which this might be done.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(i) Better directed police discretion</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The police have the discretion not to arrest or
lay a charge in a wide range of circumstances, subject to their
duty to protect the peace and to uphold the law. This exercise of
discretion applies in the enforcement of the drug laws. In
practice this means that many police officers choose, in many
circumstances, not to lay charges where they become aware of
minor drug offences. The anecdotal evidence is that the police
are increasingly exercising their discretion in this way, perhaps
especially with cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The exercise of police discretion in this way
is not only legitimate but desirable. It contributes positively
to public health outcomes, and reduces what would otherwise be a
literally intolerable burden on criminal justice resources if
every episode of drug use or possession which came to police
notice were prosecuted.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is desirable however that there be some
standardisation of this exercise of discretion, to achieve
greater uniformity of police practice (and therefore social
equity) and to better target particular public health objectives.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">We propose that the Commissioner's Instructions
should be amended to give guidance to police on the exercise of
their discretion.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some suggestions are:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police guidelines should specifically
discourage arrest in overdose and similar medical emergency
situations, of either the overdose patient or their associates.
Knowing that there was no risk of arrest would encourage people
experiencing overdose, or their friends, to seek medical help as
early as possible. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">People suffering overdose, or other physical or
psychological distress, should be able to access medical services
without fear of arrest. There are some 220 drug overdose
fatalities in NSW each year. Many of these deaths are
preventable. Studies show that one in three heroin users report
having had at least one overdose experience.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Police should be encouraged not to harass
clients of methadone clinics, even if known drug users are likely
to congregate there. [This would be an extension of existing
guidelines which discourage police harassment of clients of
needle and syringe exchanges.]</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Existing Commissioner's Instructions
(Instruction 16.02), say that police should not interrupt
injection, nor deliberately break syringes. In fact, these
practices still occur. Relevant police instructions should be
made the subject of training and greater management direction.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The Police Service should undertake a
comprehensive examination of its practices and protocols as they
impact on drugs policy. The fact that there are existing
Commissioner's Instructions which are not being applied raises
questions about the capacity of the Police Service to respond
flexibly and appropriately in this area, in the absence of
legislative reform. If measures are taken to develop the
application of police discretion in drugs policy, it must be
closely monitored to assess the degree of compliance with
guidelines. If this approach does not significantly improve the
current negative impact of law enforcement on effective drugs
policy, the only alternative is to legislate change to laws.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">(ii) Formal police cautions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The recent Victorian Premier's Drug Advisory
Council Report (the Pennington Report) recommended that the use
and possession of illicit drugs be dealt with through a system of
automatic formal police cautions for first offenders (with
voluntary referral to drug assessment and treatment services).
Mandatory good behaviour bonds would be imposed as a sentence for
second offenders. Third offenders would be dealt with by a court
in the normal way (ie, by decision of the magistrate to impose
fines, community service orders, or other appropriate penalty).</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">A mandatory caution/bond system for drug use
and possession offences would make police contact with drug users
less negative than it is now (except for repeat offenders), and
would allow law enforcement to be accompanied by referral to
treatment or counselling services in appropriate cases.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If introduced, this system should be closely
monitored for its effect on the number and type of cases brought
before the courts. (It should be noted that introducing a system
of police referral to drug treatment services may result in an
increased demand for those services, which are now significantly
under-researched.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2">(iii) On-the-spot fines</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Some jurisdictions (South Australia, the
Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory) have
introduced a system of on-the-spot fines as a method of
&quot;decriminalising&quot; the personal use and possession of
marijuana.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Since this system was implemented in South
Australia in 1987, there has been a 450% increase in the number
of fine notices issued (although research shows that marijuana
usage has increased only slightly, in line with increases in
other States). Half of the 18,000 people issued with notices last
year did not pay their fine on time, exposing them to the risk of
arrest, prosecution and incurring a criminal record.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In practice therefore, this initiative has
actually increased the cost of police and court time devoted to
marijuana law enforcement.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the ACT and NT, it is too early to say
whether there will be a similar escalation in the number of
notices issued. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">There are few apparent advantages in adopting
this measure. The other alternatives offer either more complete
and systematic solutions, or the opportunity for more flexible
policing practices.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">· Remove prison as a sentencing option for
drug use or possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If the offences of drug use and possession are
not abolished, then at the least, imprisonment should be removed
as an available sentencing option.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Prison sentences are a completely inappropriate
penalty for minor drug possession and use offences. Imprisonment
has never been evaluated for its effects on drug use or
possession recidivism, although anecdotal evidence suggests that
it does not deter ongoing drug use. Research into the question
should be encouraged.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">About 150 people are gaoled each year in NSW
for drug use or possession of small quantities of drugs. In 1995
(the most recent figures available), there were 62 people gaoled
for use or possession of marijuana, 61 were gaoled for use or
possession of heroin, and 44 were gaoled for use or possession of
other drugs. Although custodial sentences of up to eight months
were imposed, the period of imprisonment for most was less than
two months. In relative terms, these prison terms would be
considered short. However, considering the minor nature of the
offences and prevailing social attitudes, they are
extraordinarily harsh. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">3 . Allow use of cannabis for medical purposes </font></p>

<p><font size="2">If the offences of drug use and possession are
removed, there is no need for separate treatment for those who
use cannabis for genuinely therapeutic purposes. However, if
those offences remain, an exception should exist for the medical
applications of cannabis.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Cannabis in smokable form is a valuable
alternative to other medical treatments for people living with
AIDS and for some cancer and glaucoma patients. It is useful for
nausea and pain relief, and to stimulate appetite. Smokable
cannabis is now used in the community for these purposes without
recognition, support or medical supervision.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Synthetic cannabis products in tablet form are
available on prescription, but they are not satisfactory. They
are expensive and reported to be less effective in achieving the
desired therapeutic results. Many patients who smoke marijuana to
control nausea are unable to swallow tablets. For some conditions
(eg, weight loss associated with AIDS), there are no effective
alternatives.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">As well, numerous people living with hepatitis
use cannabis as a social alternative to alcohol.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4 Allow possession of drug equipment as well as
needles and syringes</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Possession of equipment intended for use of
prohibited drugs is illegal - needles and syringes are the only
exception. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">It is anomalous to publicly fund the
distribution of needles and syringes, but not to allow the
possession of swabs, sterile water and tourniquets for the
purpose of using illegal drugs.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Allowing the legal possession of all
intravenous drug using equipment would assist in HIV prevention.
It would also assist in preventing Hepatitis C infection, which
often results from sharing equipment other than needles and
syringes., and it would assist in holistic harm reduction (eg,
using sterile water to reduce the risk of injecting bacteria
which can cause a range of illnesses).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The sale and possession of bongs for the
smoking of cannabis is also illegal even though using a bong is
probably less harmful than smoking cannabis cigarettes. Further
research should be undertaken into the relative physical harms of
different methods of consuming cannabis (eg, in cigarettes,
through bongs, or in foods).</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Legalising the sale and possession of cannabis
smoking equipment would assist education strategies aimed at
encouraging cannabis users to use in relatively safe ways.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">5 . Provide safe injecting spaces</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Legal safe injecting spaces (or &quot;shooting
rooms&quot;) would considerably reduce the harm associated with
injecting drug use in public places like parks and laneways. Safe
injecting spaces could reduce drug overdose deaths, and should
also reduce the number of used syringes unsafely disposed of in
public places. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Publicly funded, safe injecting spaces should
be introduced on a trial basis in areas of existing high
intravenous drug use. The trial should be conducted over two
years, with an initial review after six months.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Potential benefits include:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">i. Reduction in injecting drug use in public
places (such as parks and laneways), with the consequent public
health dangers posed by used needles being left in those places.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">ii. Improved access and personal safety for
ambulance officers and other health workers treating overdoses.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">The difficulty with introducing such a trial is
that the authorities are wary of funding, even tolerating,
facilities at which people would break the law (ie by self
administration). We have made a number of suggestions above about
reform of the law, or at least law enforcement practices, around
drug use and possession. Introducing any of those proposals would
clear the way legally for the introduction of safe injecting
spaces.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The proposal for safe injecting spaces is a
logical extension of existing needle and syringe exchange
programs. The legal framework to allow shooting rooms to operate
(in the absence of more far-reaching changes to the law), would
be similar to the arrangements for needle and syringe exchange
programs, namely: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">legislative amendment to make it not an offence
to inject a prohibited drug on site at an approved safe injecting
place (at least for the duration of a trial);</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">instructions to police to not harass the
clients of the facilities (just as existing instructions direct
police to not harass needle exchange clients)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">statutory amendment to protect workers in safe
injecting places from prosecution for aiding and abetting
offences. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">6 Allow use, possession and supply of Narcan
without prescription</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Narcan is an anti-narcotic used to revive
people in the event of narcotic overdose. It has no pleasurable
effects, and no effect on someone who has not used heroin or
other narcotics. Wider availability of Narcan has been
recommended by researchers at the National Drug and Alcohol
Research Centre as an effective way to reduce fatal heroin
overdoses.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">If Narcan were to be made more readily
available, it should be accompanied by an appropriately targeted
education campaign to ensure that Narcan is understood to be a
first aid measure only. The person revived from the overdose by a
shot of Narcan requires further medical attention, involving
either calling an ambulance or attendance at a hospital.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">FUTURE CHANGE</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The implementation of these proposals should be
followed by continuing attention to laws and programmes which
impact adversely on public health and other social programmes.
Relevant government agencies should undertake a comprehensive
review to identify which laws require amendment to further reduce
drug related harm. Key agencies to be involved in such a review
are the Departments of Health, Attorney-General's, Police, and
School Education.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">In the longer term, the nature and pace of
further changes to drug law and policy will need to be considered
and debated.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Implementing some or all of the above proposals
would significantly improve public health outcomes. Making these
changes would allow the community to decide whether and how to
take further steps.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">We should begin now, in a measured way, to
explore and implement workable alternatives to the failure of
drugs prohibition. </font></p>
