<H2>Australia</H2>
The value of spending in Australia by overseas tourists has doubled in the past decade to $8 billion.  The number of foreign tourist visits to Australia has also doubled since 1987 and is approaching 4 million per year.
<P>
Sales to foreigners by Australian transport operators are an additional $2.3 billion.  Foreign tourism contributes just over 2% of national GDP compared with domestic tourist spending of $15 billion or 3% of GDP.
<P>
The rapid growth of foreign tourism began with a decline in the Australian dollar in the mid 1980s and has benefited from economic expansion in Asia and improved marketing by the Australian tourism industry.
<P>
More tourist visits are originating from Asia.  Japan is the major source of tourists (30% of the total).  Other Asian countries now account for 25% of the total.  The number of tourists from New Zealand, Europe and North America is rising more slowly.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
Spending by both foreign and interstate tourists in Victoria is around $2.3 billion or 2% of Gross State Product (GSP).  Spending by foreign tourists accounts for 40% of the total and domestic tourism makes up the remaining 60%.  <P>
In 1995, Victoria attracted 800,000 visitors from overseas and almost 3 million visitors from other Australian states.  Foreign tourist visits have consistently grown faster than domestic tourism since the mid 1980s.  <P>
Victoria has over 30,000 hotel and motel rooms.  Renewed growth in domestic tourist visits to Victoria combined with the on-going growth in overseas tourism lifted takings from accommodation in Victoria in 1994/95 to $493 million, a 12 % real increase on the previous year.
<P>
Investment in the hotels and other tourism projects in Victoria has rebounded and is set to increase further over the next few years.  The construction of the Melbourne Casino hotel and other new tourism-related projects and events such as the Grand Prix will see investment activity return to high levels during 1996 and 1997.
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The Bureau of Tourism Research projected overseas tourist visits to average growth of 7% over the rest of the 1990s and reach six million by the year 2000. Rapid economic growth in Asia is expected to be the main driving force behind the expected growth in tourism.  <P>
