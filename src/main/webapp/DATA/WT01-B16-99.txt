Prof Viktor Mikhailov
graduated from the Moscow Engineering and Physical Institute in 1958 as a specialist on theoretical nuclear physics. He joined the All-Union (now All-Russia) Research Institute of Experimental Physics in Arzamas-16, the country's oldest and largest nuclear centre. There he did research on the development of nuclear explosion processes and on techniques of measuring fast impulse reactions of fission and fusion in these processes. He worked at the Moscow Research Institute of Impulse Technology from 1969, and became its head in 1988. In 1988 he led on the Soviet side a Soviet-US experiment on controlling the capacity of nuclear tests at the Nevada and Semipalatinsk test sites. In the same year he was appointed Deputy Minister for Nuclear Power Development and Industry and entrusted with heading the country's nuclear weapons complex. He has held his present post of Russian Federation Minister for Nuclear Power since March 1992. In July 1995 he also became a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation. He has a doctorate in technology and holds a professorial chair at the Moscow Engineering and Physical Institute. He is Vice President of the International Information Academy and scientific head of the All-Russia Research Institute of Experimental Physics in Kremlev. He won the Lenin Prize in 1967 and the State Prize in 1982. His hobby is chess.
