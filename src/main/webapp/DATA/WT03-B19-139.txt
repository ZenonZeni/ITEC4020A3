<H2>Purpose </H2>
<P>
To increase the entry of new and innovative food products into
export markets. 
<P>
<H2>Background   </H2>
<P>
The McKinsey Report into Emerging Exporters identified a significant
market trend in consumer demand for specialised and customised
products. 
<P>
The development of niche markets, increasingly important to the
growth of small and medium sized firms, accentuates the need for
market information and representation. Entry and access to niche
markets is of special significance in the food processing sector.
<P>
Many Victorian food products and processes require modification
to gain acceptability in overseas markets. Market research, consumer
tastings, trial shipments, re-formulation and repackaging may
be required to meet specific consumer requirements. Assistance
programs currently accentuate marketing rather than focussing
on these essential steps in entering new food processing markets.
<H2>Description   </H2>
<P>
This Pilot Program includes: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Market research 
<LI>Product and process development and modification 
<LI>New technology assessment and transfer.
</UL>
<P>
Market research will assess if the firm can expect to sell at
least $650,000 of product over five years.
<P>
Consultancy assistance to firms will follow the guidelines for
AusIndustry programs but will be limited to firms with a turnover
of less than $20 million and existing export sales of at least $500,00 p.a. 
In-house development expenses will not be supported.
<H2>Users</H2>
<P>
The program is aimed specifically at smaller firms. There is room
for up to twenty food companies that satisfy guidelines
for financial viability.
<H2>Funding</H2>
<P>
Participating companies will receive up to $50,000, the level
depending on the extent of their market opportunity. Funding will
be matched by the firms' contribution on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
<H2>Outcomes</H2>
<P>
Twenty new products entering the international market could generate
annual sales of at least $100,000. Over five years, that represents
$10 million in additional exports.
