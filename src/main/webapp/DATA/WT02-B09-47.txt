<h2 ALIGN=center> The Friendship Factor: Are You Being a Good Friend?</h2>


An old expression claims that genuine friendship is like sound health; its value is seldom known until it's lost. We believe that friendship is not only similar to good health, but it also plays a key role in good health. For that reason, everyone should take time to develop and nurture genuine friendships. <p>


<BR>




How Good a Friend Are You?

<p>


<BR>




To have a good friend, you must be a good friend, one willing to devote time and effort to the relationship. The following quiz will help determine how much you know about friendship: (Answer True or False)<p>





<ul>


<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 1. Envy is a normal part of many friendships.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 2. It's possible to have too many friends. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 3. In selecting friends, you should look for people of similar age and with similar backgrounds.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 4. It's more difficult to make friends now than 20 years ago.<BR>

<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 5. It's possible to outgrow friends.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 6. Friendships that are too strong can be harmful.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 7. In our mobile society, long-term friendships are nearly impossible.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 8. A male-female friendship is not always the first step toward romance, but can be a healthy sign of the times.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 9. The best friendships are 50-50 kinds of relationships.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 10. Some people find it very difficult to make friends.<BR>


<BR>



<BR>


<img src="graphics/co896b2.gif" align=left hspace=20>





<BR><BR>

Answers:<BR><BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 1. True, but that doesn't mean it should destroy the relationship. Be honest about it; admit to your friends that they have a talent or quality you envy. They may respond with a similar "confession."<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 2. True, if your purpose is merely to clutter your social calendar and keep yourself so busy that you escape solitude. Most people maintain friendships of different degrees. Friends range from pleasant acquaintances to intimate soulmates.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 3. False. It's healthy to have friends who span the age brackets and who represent different socioeconomic backgrounds. Acceptance is the key. For a friendship to flourish, friends must accept each other for what they are and not try to initiate changes.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 4. True. Think of how our society has been altered in the last few decades: More women are in the workforce; life in the suburbs means longer commuting times; families are relocating more often; people are more security-minded and install fences and other "barriers"; the competitive nature of big business pits peers against each other in a survival-of-the-fittest kind of environment; and working couples, tired at the end of the week, choose to withdraw and get away rather than seek the company of others.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 5. True. Two women may be drawn together because they have children involved in the same activities. The women work on committees together, share carpool duties and enjoy discussing their common interests. After the children are grown, the women find they have less and less to discuss. The relationship ends quietly and naturally.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 6. True. It's possible to be too good a friend during a crisis and actually make an unhappy situation worse. First, you can hover over hurting friends and almost smother them with concern. Second, you can empathize with hurting friends to the point of adding to their suffering. By assuming their burden, you try to lighten it, but the opposite occurs.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 7. False. They merely require more work. Several ingenious methods can keep friendships alive and well. Cassette tapes can be recorded and swapped by mail; long-distance phone visits can take place often; same-time-next-year vacations can be arranged at a location convenient to both.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 8. True. Many men and women view each other as colleagues who share common interests and goals. No longer does a male-female relationship have to be based on romantic attractions. Men now feel less of a need to be macho with a female friend, and women don't try to be "one of the boys."<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 9. True. A one-way friendship can be the source of great anxiety. An equal give-and-take friendship develops both partners.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> 10. True. To make friends easily, you must project friendliness. This involves taking the risk of being rejected. Often, persons who are preoccupied with themselves aren't willing to show their vulnerability to others.<BR>


<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Overcome Control Addiction With Deliberate Choices</h2>


Most of us, to some degree or another, like to be in control. For some, the ability to take command, organize and exercise leadership is a positive strength. But this strength can quickly turn into a disastrous weakness when it disrupts our most important relationships – family relationships, friendships, and business relationships. At the point where our urge to control becomes compulsive, unrestrainable and destructive to relationships, it's become control addiction. <p>


<BR>

Control-addicted people are often unaware that they have a problem – or that they create problems for other people. They tend to be so convinced of the correctness of their opinion, methods and priorities that they can scarcely tolerate anyone or anything that contradicts them. They tend to feel driven by a sense of duty and generally act superior on the outside while feeling inferior on the inside. <p><BR>



Self Test: Do You Have a Control Addiction?<p><BR>



Take the following quiz to see if you may be addicted to control. Check the statements below that apply to you:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I hate to admit my weaknesses, even if they seem obvious to others.

<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I get irritated when other people make mistakes.

<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I tend to use words like should, ought, must, and can't when I'm talking to other people.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I tend to do an important job myself because others might not do it right.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I'm annoyed and upset more often than I'd like to be.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Once I've formulated an opinion, I don't tend to change it.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I stay away from people whose opinions are different from mine.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> When I'm working on a project, I often become so focused that I get irritated when people interrupt me and I tend to snap at them.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I get impatient when other people can't understand what needs to be done.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I would rather let people have a false favorable impression of me than be open and vulnerable.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> When someone tells me about a personal problem, I feel I have to find a solution.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I use silence to punish those who disappoint or disagree with me.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Before starting a project, I dwell on it constantly to be sure I'll do it just right.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> When someone else is in a foul mood, it puts me in a foul mood too.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Critical thoughts come to my mind more often than I'd like.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> When someone confronts me about my opinions or beliefs, I immediately begin to formulate a rebuttal.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I have a mental list of standards people should meet before I accept them.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I sometimes resent having to do so much for my family.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> I'm uncomfortable when others share very personal emotions with me.<BR>


<BR>


The average person will check a few of these statements. If you checked fewer than five, you're very serene and composed – or else you need to see yourself more positively. If you checked five to eight statements, you're probably fairly normal. If you checked nine or more statements, you're a likely candidate for unnecessary emotional stress and tension – and you exhibit signs of a strong need to control. Your controlling tendencies are going to create problems for you and the people around you. They will continually interfere with your relationships, and with your happiness and self-esteem.<BR><BR>



Control-addicted people can free themselves from the need always to be right; they can give themselves and others the freedom to be human and to make mistakes. The key to recovery lies in (1) understanding the addiction and (2) yielding that addiction for healing.<BR><BR>



Yielding The Addiction<BR><BR>



How can this addiction be cured? It must be yielded, moment by moment. If you're a control addict, learn to make these deliberate choices: <BR><BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> "I choose to let others be themselves." This means allowing your children to make their own mistakes and to be human. It means letting your spouse's imperfections slide past without comment, without resentment. It means giving more slack to your friends and employees. It also means not taking over and doing things for other people in the belief they won't do it right. It means you stop pushing others to get their work done, to get to an appointment on time and to do their work better. Instead, positively encourage others to be responsible for their actions – and step back and let them act.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> "I choose to let me be me." The same grace you're attempting to give to others you must also give to yourself. When you feel tempted to judge yourself for a mistake, stop. Say to yourself, "I'm only human." Give yourself the right to make mistakes – even an occasional relapse into old controlling patterns. Give yourself the right to make human mistakes.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> "I choose to live humbly." No more acting superior while feeling inferior. From now on, you don't have to be perfect, you don't have to be right, you don't have to hide your weaknesses, and you don't have to maintain an image. Try to see every irritation, setback, and disappointment in life as a chance to learn more about humility, and in time you'll see a pattern of humility seeping into your life.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> "I choose to be firm without being controlling." No one is suggesting you go from being a controller to being a pushover. You can still be firm in your convictions while being open-minded and a good listener. You can be a leader without being a controller. You can be organized without being a hyperperfectionist. Practice being assertively firm without resorting to sarcasm, manipulation, accusations, the silent treatment, or a coercive tone of voice.<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Eating Disorders: Know The Signs</h2>


Despite frantic efforts to revive her, Karen Carpenter was pronounced dead at the hospital at the age of 32. She had collapsed at her home and went into cardiac arrest. Cause of death: malnutrition, due to anorexia nervosa. A related affliction, bulimia, has also taken its toll of lives. <p>


<BR>

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia are closely related eating disorders. They are characterized by the compulsive drive to control weight by unhealthy means. Anorexia nervosa is defined as self-induced starvation resulting in extreme, often life-threatening weight loss. Bulimia is defined as a pattern of overindulging in food, followed by self-induced vomiting or abuse of laxatives in order to produce weight loss. <p><BR>



Authorities estimate that about one percent of women between ages 12 and 25 suffer from anorexia, and about one and a half percent in that age group suffer from bulimia. These disorders are commonly seen as women's disorders, although about 10 percent of anorexics or bulimics are men.<p><BR>



The effects of anorexia nervosa and bulimia are devastating to the medical , emotional, and even spiritual well-being. Some effects include:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> a menstrual cycle that stops temporarily or becomes irregular;

<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> digestive impairment, resulting from the abuse of laxatives;

<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> imbalance of electrolytes in the body, causing irregular heartbeat and in extreme cases heart failure and death;<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> low white blood cell count (anemia) and impaired immune system;<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> inflammation of the esophagus, resulting from self-induced vomiting;<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> erosion of tooth enamel, owing to gastric acids from self-induced vomiting;<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> brain and central nervous system disorders, including seizures;<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> glandular dysfunctions, including thyroid abnormalities, resulting in fatigue;<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> kidney problems;<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> accumulation of abdominal fluids, resulting in a "potbelly";<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> hiatal hernias;<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> low blood sugar, resulting in headaches and dizziness;<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> musculoskeletal problems from potassium deficiency, resulting in muscle spasms, pain, and muscle atrophy; and<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> dry skin and thinning hair.<BR>


<BR>



A key issue to be resolved in the recovery process for anorexia nervosa and bulimia is the issue of body image. Most anorexics and bulimics hate what they see when they look in the mirror. This condition, which Minirith Meier New Life Clinics calls body hate, is quite common, particularly among women, whether a person has an eating disorder or not. People with body hate dwell on the flaws and have little or no awareness of their positive features. Body hate is exacerbated by a culture that emphasizes standards of beauty that equate being attractive with being thin. In people with eating disorders, body hate takes on excessive proportions, compelling them to reach for an impossible ideal.<BR>


<BR>



 What should you do if a close friend or loved one shows signs of anorexia or bulimia? Here are several steps to take:<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Lovingly confront them about their symptoms.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Seek professional medical help for family members who are minors.<BR>


<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Seek professional therapy and emotional support for them.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Be candid about their appearance. Tell them if they look unhealthy. (Make sure your honesty is coated with love.)<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Listen and empathize. Let them sense your love and understanding. Avoid judging or criticizing.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Show love and unconditional acceptance. Persevere during the healing process and seek always to demonstrate affection and acceptance, even when it's not easy.<BR>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Five Essentials to a Great Marriage</h2>


There are 107 million married people in the United States and many of them are aching for a better marriage. In fact, it's predicted that 66 percent of all marriages that begin this year in the United States will end in separation or divorce. <p>


<BR>




In an effort to discover how couples can move from having an ordinary relationship to an extraordinary marriage, Neil Clark Warren, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist from Pasadena, California, surveyed 100 couples with "extremely healthy" marriages to unveil their secrets. His research reveals that there are 10 "secrets" to creating a brilliant marriage – five of them are absolutely essential.<p>


<BR>




The Five Essentials of a Great Marriage<p>





<ul>


<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Dream a big dream for your marriage. Warren suggests a husband and wife construct a vision of everything their marriage can be. His research couples claimed that although they often lived day-by-day, they had a great overall vision for their relationships that guided their marriages. "Every couple needs to have a vision for their future," Warren says. "And they need to keep that vision up-to-date and carefully focused."<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Learn to talk. Master healthy communication.  All the survey participants responded that communication will give couples the wherewithal to express the strongest desires of their hearts, the most profound thoughts of their brains, and the most sensitive concerns of their souls. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Work it through. Conflict is inevitable so learn to handle it productively. Nearly 50 percent of all divorces take place within three years of the wedding day. This means a lot of couples can't resolve conflict. Warren's 30 years of clinical practice have taught him that the amount of conflict in a marriage only determines the speed at which the marriage is moving toward greatness or toward destruction. "Conflict, well managed, is like a stairway that can lead you to higher and higher levels of marital brilliance," he says.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Negotiate a mutually satisfying sexual relationship. Work on chemistry. The 200 people in Warren's survey reported a broad range of sexual satisfaction. From his research, Warren believes that sex by itself usually isn't vital enough to devastate any marriage if other factions are sufficiently positive. But he's convinced that if every couple can be taught to improve their sexual relationship by just 10 percent, the divorce rate would be lowered by 10 percent.<BR>

<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Pursue spirituality! Partners in great marriages find significance in their spiritual lives. The 100 couples in Warren's sample consistently cited some form of "spirituality" as crucial to the development of their extremely healthy marriages. They pointed out what's been recognized for a long time – that when a couple gets spiritually healthy, they automatically move a significant distance in the direction of marital oneness.<BR>


<BR>


Finally, Warren advised that most marriages are incredibly complex. They can't be revolutionized overnight, but can move from ordinary to magnificent over time.<BR>
