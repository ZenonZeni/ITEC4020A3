<H3><B>Visiting the Clinic</H3></B>

After checking in at the desk, you will be given intake forms which ask about your health history.  next, you will be shown to the interview room.  There the attending medical staff and student assistants will ask you questions about your general physical and emotional health.  You will be asked to extend your tongue -- its color and appearance are valuable in diagnosis.  Your pulse will be felt to discern subtle characteristics of your condition.

<P>

From this examination, a picture composed of individual symptoms and sign emerges, which may point to an identifiable pattern of disharmony.  When this diagnosis has been made, the clinician will prescribe the appropriate acupuncture and herbal treatment.  Other treatment modalities which may be used include tui-na (Chinese massage) and Chinese nutritional counseling.  Your treatment plan will be discussed with you and with your consent, treatment will proceed.  

<P>

<H3><B>Treatment</H3></B>

The acupuncture treatment is performed by a member of the clinic medical staff or by students under his or her supervision.  In the American College Community Clinic, sterile needles are used once and then disposed of .  Acupuncture needles are very thin and cause little or no pain when inserted. After the needle has been inserted at the point, you may feel tingling, pressure or warmth.  This simply means that the qi has arrived.

<P>

There are a variety of techniques that may be combined during an acupuncture treatment.  Sometimes the needles are given mild electric stimulus.  Another type of treatment uses moxibustion (the burning of artemisia herb) above the skin to warm and stimulate the acupuncture points.  Some practitioners use tui na, Chinese massage, to treat a variety of musculoskeletal problems.

<P>

Please ask us it you have any questions about the treatments you are receiving.  We want you to have the best possible experience at the Clinic.

<P>

<H3><B>Herbs</H3></B> 

If herbs are prescribed for you, the prescription will be filled while you are in the treatment room.  These herbs are usually in dried form and must be brewed to make a tea.  Occasionally your practitioner my prescribe herbal pills or powders.
