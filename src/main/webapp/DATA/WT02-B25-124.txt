<p>This Legislator Outreach Guide has been designed to provide
you with ideas and tips for educating state legislators about
brain disorder issues, such as insurance parity and
anti-discrimination. The more legislators understand about brain
disorders, the more likely they are to take steps to enact supportive
legislation. Inside you will find: (1) science and treatment
messages; (2) ideas on how to start your outreach efforts; and
(3) science and treatment outreach recommendations. We have also included
some proven AMI affiliate strategies, which you can replicate in
your own community, as appropriate.</p>

<p>It is a critical time for advocates of people with brain
disorders. While significant strides have been made in many
states to guarantee equality for people with brain disorders,
many states still continue to deny adequate insurance coverage
and fair treatment to individuals suffering from brain disorders. This
situation is intolerable -- and it is reversible.</p>

<p>This document features a wide range of proven legislative
strategies. Choose the ones that will help you meet your goals,
whether that means modest changes or a major overhaul of laws
governing insurance coverage and anti-discrimination. No one
tactic will achieve everything, so be prepared to try various
methods. And remember, do not get frustrated if you do not effect
radical change at first. Most changes are incremental, but
together they can have a tremendous impact.</p>

<p><b>Messages</b></p>

<p>By working with local lawmakers, you can help ensure that
NAMI&#146;s messages on the science and treatment of brain
disorders are heard during deliberation about health care issues.
These messages are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Science shows that severe mental illnesses are brain
        disorders, no different than other physical illnesses.
        There is absolutely no biomedical justification for
        policies that judge brain disorders as being in any way
        less real or less deserving of treatment.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Treatment of brain disorders works.<br>
        </li>
    <li>The costs of treating brain disorders are comparable to
        the costs of treating many other physical illnesses; it
        makes economic sense to cover these disorders equally.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Legislation must be passed to guarantee health insurance
        parity and put an end to discrimination against people
        with brain disorders.</li>
</ul>

<p>A message chart with supporting facts for each message is
provided in the Media Outreach Tools folder for your use.</p>

<p><b>Getting Started</b></p>

<p>The following are the fundamentals of legislator outreach:</p>

<p><i>Develop a Plan.</i> Before you begin outreach to
legislators, develop a brief plan to guide your work. This plan
should include your legislative goals and objectives, target
audiences, proposed activities, and a rough timeline. (A sample
plan outline is included to help you guide your thinking.)</p>

<p>Even if legislators in your area are not currently engaged in
this debate, seize the opportunity to lay a positive foundation
before parity and other anti-discrimination issues emerge. At the
same time, you should also have a system in place for responding
to legislative developments. For example, identify an AMI member
who will be prepared to contact the media about your
affiliate&#146;s position on new legislation.</p>

<p><i>Form a Legislative Committee</i>. Identify members who have
personal connections with legislators. Consider members with a
variety of backgrounds (e.g., consumer, family member, scientist, psychiatrist).
Also identify non-member professionals who are supportive of AMI.
Ask these individuals to serve on a legislative committee, which
will help manage outreach activities. Take the time to train
these committee members; the enclosed questions and answers are a
good way to tackle tough questions.</p>

<p>Provide your committee members with practical tools they can
use to deliver brain disorder messages effectively. Good examples
include legislative updates, in-depth information about specific
pieces of legislation, voting records of legislators, and message
points for both phone calls and letters to lawmakers.</p>

<p><i>Identify Key Legislators. </i>To best maximize resources,
identify legislators with the greatest influence over parity
legislation rather than trying to blanket the entire universe of
politicians. Consider identifying legislators representing the
key undecided (swing) votes on an issue. You might also contact
lawmakers supportive of your issue who can help you educate these
swing voters. Take note of legislators in both parties.</p>

<p><i>Get to Know Your Legislators</i>. Contact legislators, and
request a brief meeting <i>before</i> bills are introduced. This
will help acquaint them with the issues. Learn about their
backgrounds and what constituencies are important to them. Gauge
legislators&#146; personal awareness of brain disorder issues. Assess
what will encourage them to take action (e.g., data,
consumer-driven appeals).</p>

<p><i>Get to Know Your Supporters</i>. Find out which
organizations, individuals, and businesses are supportive of
brain disorder issues, such as the local chapter of the American
Psychiatric Association, researchers at local universities, as
well as other key players in the treatment of brain disorders.
Conduct outreach to these groups, and get them to partner with
you on legislator outreach. Make sure to locate groups you might
not normally partner with but whose issues indirectly relate to brain
disorders.</p>

<p><i>Get to Know the Opposition. </i>Find out which groups and
businesses are not supportive of brain disorder issues. Meet with
them to try to understand their points of view. Use the enclosed
science and treatment information to educate them about brain
disorder issues. Try to find some common ground and persuade them
to support your legislative efforts.</p>

<p><i>Monitor and Evaluate Legislation. </i>Learn about the
legislative process. Identify key committees and subcommittees to
watch. Assign someone in the committee to clip articles about
upcoming legislation and debate on brain disorders. Also make
sure to obtain copies of all relevant legislation so you can carefully
track parity and anti-discrimination issues and plan next steps.
Contact your regional director in the field for more information
about the legislative process.</p>

<p><b>Legislator Outreach Tips</b></p>

<p>There are many ways to indirectly and directly effect
legislative change -- the process is a multi-layered one.
Remember that public opinion, grassroots activity, and media
coverage, as well as direct legislative contact, can all be very
influential factors in policy decisions. (Please see attached NAMI
Legislative Vision diagram.)</p>

<p>Regardless of the activities you undertake, make sure your
timing is right. There are some scheduled events that can help
enhance your outreach, such as Mental Illness Awareness Week or
National Depression Screening Day. There are also important
legislative milestones which you cannot always predict ahead of
time but which can greatly increase your impact, such as
committee and subcommittee hearings, floor debates, and votes on
bills. To the best of your ability, try to time your activities
to coincide with these events.</p>

<p>The following are only a few ideas to help you get started:</p>

<p><i><u>Generating Grassroots Support -- Ring Around the Capitol</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Hold vigils and rallies at your state legislature
        demanding equal treatment for people with brain disorders.
        For example, form a human circle around the capitol. Ask
        everyone but a small percentage of participants to dress
        in black. The others should dress in white and should
        wear placards saying, &quot;I am one of (fill in number)
        people in America who has (choose brain disorder). We are
        everywhere.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Conduct marches across town with your allies demanding
        parity legislation. <br>
        </li>
    <li>Contact supportive organizations, like the local chapters
        of the American Psychiatric Association. Ask them to
        mobilize their members to deliver science and treatment
        messages to legislators.<br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Public Education -- Look How Far We&#146;ve Come </u></i><br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Work with local colleges and universities to host a <i>Media
        Theater</i> movie/media seminar, featuring selected films
        and other media depicting people with brain disorders.
        For example, show such movies as (or clips from) &quot;My
        Own Private Idaho,&quot; &quot;Benny and Joon,&quot; and
        &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#146;s Nest.&quot; Invite
        a panel of local experts to review the history of how movies
        and other media have portrayed people with brain
        disorders. <br>
        </li>
    <li>Work with your local library to develop an exhibit on
        brain disorders. This exhibit can feature a variety of
        books, movies, and articles on brain disorders, which
        visitors can access while at the library. Provide this
        kit&#146;s brain disorder fact sheets, which visitors can
        take with them.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Cultivating Legislative Allies --We Can&#146;t Do It
Without You</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Use the enclosed talking points to conduct one-on-one or
        group briefings for key legislators. You might arrange a
        meeting prior to a major vote or to update legislators on
        new science and treatment of brain disorders.<br>
        </li>
    <li><i>Adopt-a-Legislator</i>. When you determine which
        legislators are key to brain disorder issues, ask AMI
        members in their districts to build relationships with
        the policymakers. Members should try to meet with their
        designated legislators on a regular basis and inform them
        of all new science and treatment advances.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Conduct <i>Bag It</i> brown-bag lunch sessions or
        legislative breakfasts at the state legislature for legislative
        staff. Provide staff with current science and treatment
        information, and propose ways they can have an impact on
        legislation to guarantee fair treatment of people with
        brain disorders.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Host events, like town meetings, lectures, or panel
        discussions, and invite legislators to participate. This
        will help acquaint politicians with different
        perspectives and local players in the brain disorder
        debate. You should also present an <i>Open Your Mind</i>
        award to the legislator(s) who has been most supportive
        of brain disorder issues. Be sure to invite the press.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Proof of Consumer/Voter Concern -- Show Our Strength</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a &quot;phone tree&quot; or &quot;e-mail
        tree&quot; (for those with access to e-mail) to mobilize members
        to respond to upcoming legislation. First, provide a
        complete list of AMI affiliate names to your members,
        indicating which five names on the list each member has been
        assigned. Identify and call/write the five people who
        will make the first round of <i>Brain Alerts</i>. Each of
        those five individuals will call or write the five names
        they are responsible for (as per the list), and so on. <br>
        </li>
    <li>Each person should encourage members to call or e-mail
        their legislators and encourage them to support brain
        disorder issues. (Make sure to announce that you live in
        the legislator&#146;s district and are a supporter.)
        Everyone should also provide necessary message points and
        legislative information. These <i>Alerts</i> should
        continue until all AMI members have been contacted. Make sure
        that all critical legislators have been reached; if
        members do not reside in an important district, assign
        someone to cover that area&#146;s representatives.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Lead a <i>Brain Alert</i> letter-writing campaign using
        the strategy above. Each caller should encourage members
        to write their legislators. Try to avoid sample letters,
        which are not as effective as original correspondence.
        For a new twist on this technique, include photos of
        family members with brain disorders in your letters to
        impress upon legislators that this issue has an important
        human element.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Provide legislators with fact sheets on the current
        science and treatment of brain disorders, the cost
        comparison between treating brain disorders and treating
        other medical illnesses, and ways this information might
        help impact the health insurance coverage debate. You
        should also provide copies of recent magazine and
        newspaper articles on brain disorders (e.g., <i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>).<br>
        </li>
    <li>Call the Secretary of your State Senate or the Clerk of
        your House of Representatives to find out about upcoming
        committee and subcommittee hearings on health insurance
        coverage. Contact the appropriate committees, and arrange
        to provide experts (e.g., celebrities, family members, consumers,
        psychiatrists) to testify.<br>
        </li>
    <li>Produce bumper stickers with the phrase &quot;I have a
        brain disorder, and I vote&quot; or &quot;I have (name brain
        disorder), and I vote,&quot; and distribute to your
        community.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Media Outreach -- Get the Story Straight</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Identify effective spokespeople -- <i>Media Gurus</i> --
        to contact media and respond to parity and anti-discrimination
        debate or legislation. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Use the tools discussed in the Media Outreach Tools
        section (e.g., op-eds, letters to the editor, news
        coverage, feature coverage) to deliver your messages to
        legislators, who rely on print media for much of their
        daily information.<br>
        </li>
    <li>Identify legislators who have a family member with a
        brain disorder; ask if they would be willing to conduct
        an interview with local media about their personal
        experiences.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;<i><u>Free Issue Advertising -- Open Your Mind PSA
Campaign</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Mail or deliver slicks of the enclosed print public
        service announcements (PSAs) with a cover letter to the
        advertising directors at local newspapers. These ads can
        help educate legislators and the public about brain
        disorders. (Note that PSAs cannot advocate for specific
        legislative action.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Work with your local television stations to add a local
        tag (with your phone number) to NAMI&#146;s television
        PSAs. Meet with the public service or community relations
        director at local television stations, and ask for a
        commitment to run the spots, which can help educate policymakers
        about the issues.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Proven AMI Strategies</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The New York State AMI has created a booklet of
        step-by-step instructions for running a non-partisan
        voter registration site, including whom to contact in
        your area for appropriate forms, what records should be
        kept and how best to do it, questions most frequently
        asked by voters, and how a voting machine works. These
        booklets are free through AMI-NYS by contacting
        1-800-950-FACT.<br>
        </li>
    <li>Two members of the Wisconsin AMI legislative committee
        &quot;adopted&quot; a state senator, who has a daughter
        with schizophrenia. AMI made several visits to acquaint
        the legislator with brain disorder information and
        successfully encouraged her to sponsor a parity bill.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>AMI of Virginia arranged for a local psychiatrist to make
        a brief presentation to the Virginia General
        Assembly&#146;s House Appropriations Subcommittee on
        Health and Human Resources regarding the
        cost-effectiveness and efficacy of the new generation of
        medications.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The Wisconsin AMI sends its 2,000 members routine
        &quot;alerts,&quot; which provide information about current
        legislation and urge members to contact legislators.
        These &quot;alerts&quot; also feature talking points for
        telephone conversations. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The Oklahoma AMI and other affiliates across the country
        use phone trees to effectively mobilize their members to
        contact legislators about pending legislation.</li>
</ul>
