<I>To make an individual that is metacognitively aware, is to ensure that the 	individual has learned how to learn.  The individual behaves in reflective, planful, 	and where necessary, self-corrective ways.  An important feature of executive	routines is that they can be taught.</I>  (Garner, 1988, pp. ???-???)<BR>
</DL>
As the research literature on metacognition grows, there is more support for the notion that metacognition is important in students' lives.  But how do teachers facilitate students' acquisition of metacognitive strategies?<BR>
<BR>
<LI> It is important to teach the metacognitive strategies in conjunction with the content that the strategies are to be applied to.  This allows students to have concrete experiences with metacognition, and practice the skill.  It is then hoped that this skill will be transferred to other areas.  However, the skill needs to be mastered in the context of one area first.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Teachers must often teach students how to take responsibility for their own learning first.  Many students believe that it is the teacher's responsibility to make them learn -- the result of more of an adversarial schooling environment than a collegial one.  To facilitate this shift to students taking on the responsibility for their own learning, Marzano et al.(1986) suggests these four steps:<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI> Provide explicit instruction in what the task is, what the objectives are, and how to assess progress or completion.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Provide opportunities for the class to work cooperatively, in order to mentor each others' learning.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Provide explicit instruction on how strategies may be transferred, and provide practice in this endeavor.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Help students link newly acquired knowledge to previously learned knowledge.<BR>
<BR></OL>
<LI> Other researchers have emphasized the support provided by the teacher.<BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI> Modeling may be the teacher thinking out loud while she solves a problem and checks it.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Guidance may be as simple as:<BR>
<BR><UL>
<LI> suggesting various strategies for attacking a task<BR>
<BR>
<LI> reminding students of rules previously learned (I before E except after C, e.g.),<BR>
<BR>
<LI> suggesting milestones (you should have x done by 1:00)<BR>
<BR>
<LI> purpose for planning ahead<BR>
<BR>
<LI> how to assess when you have completed the task (your chemicals should change to green and fizz).<BR>
</UL><BR>
<LI> Facilitating discussion after the task to allow students to learn:<BR>
<BR><UL>
<LI> the efficacy of various strategies,<BR><BR>
<LI> the problems they ran into,<BR><BR>
<LI> how they solved the problems,<BR><BR>
<LI> and how to avoid those problems in the future.<BR>
</UL><BR>
<LI> Using metacognitive prompts, such as:<BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI> What is the goal of this exercise?<BR><BR>
<LI> Have I encountered anything similar?<BR><BR>
<LI> What is relevant and irrelevant?<BR><BR>
<LI> What strategies will be useful?<BR><BR>
</UL></UL>
<LI> Teachers can MODEL metacognitive behavior, using techniques such as thinking out loud during problem solving, explaining the process of deciding how to attack a problem or issue, doing some explicit self-monitoring for comprehension, checking the final answer, etc.  Processes that can be most easily modeled include:<BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI> planning<BR>
<BR>
<LI> strategy selection<BR>
<BR>
<LI> self-monitoring<BR>
<BR>
<LI> self-questioning (e.g., is this all I need to know?  What does that mean? etc.)<BR>
<BR>
<LI> self-evaluation (Did I answer the question, and is it reasonable?)<BR>
<BR>
<LI> prediction of answers/conjecture/hypothesizing<BR><BR>
</UL>
<LI> Cooperative learning and small groups may facilitate this process.  Other students can help make metacognitive thoughts explicit and analyzable.  It may foster meta-cognitive discussions among students. (TOM: LINK TO FIRST CASE STUDY)<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Teachers can provide a framework that guides students.  Margaret Williamson insisted that students present work in the following format, based on Polya's (1945) work:<BR>
<BR><UL>
<LI> THINK: write a phrase describing the goal of the project or problem.  Make a list of information that will help achieve that goal.  Tell if you have encountered a problem like this before.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> PLAN:  Write a plan of how to go about solving the problem.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> DO: show all work<BR>
<BR>
<LI> LOOK BACK: write the answer in a short sentence.  Check your answer with another student.  Did your partner think about the problem in the same way?  Why or why not?<BR>
<BR>
While this is tailored to a math classroom, it should be easily translatable into other disciplines.<BR>
