<hr>
<i>by James Taylor and Donald Brasher</i><p>

<img src="../caps/wcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="W">hat will happen when Vietnam obtains most-favored-nation (MFN, or non-discriminatory tariff) status? How will exports to the United States increase? Does Vietnam have the production capacity and business skills necessary to sell in foreign markets? Vietnam's current exports to the United States, Europe and Japan provide many clues.<p>

Even without MFN, Vietnam's exports to the United States are increasing rapidly. Imports into the United States increased from $50 million in 1994 to a projected $310 million in 1996. U.S. imports are dwarfed by Vietnamese imports into Japan and Europe, where Vietnamese imports do not face high, discriminatory tariffs. In 1996, Vietnamese imports into Japan should exceed $2.3 billion, while imports into Europe should reach $1.8 billion.<p>

With the exception of woven apparel, these product categories have low tariffs or, in the case of footwear, the difference in the MFN and non-MFN tariffs are relatively small. For most footwear imports, for example athletic shoes, U.S. tariffs are 35% or less, while the MFN tariff rates are 20%. Further increases will depend on Vietnam's capacity to produce these products and Vietnam's comparative advantage.<p>

Imports of footwear into the United States jumped dramatically from less than $1 million in 1995 to over $24 million in the first nine months of 1996. The potential for Vietnamese footwear imports into the United States is enormous. This is seen by footwear imports into Europe, which reached almost $460 million in 1995. Nike and Reebok are manufacturing various athletic shoes in Vietnam, and these companies will likely be joined by other shoe manufacturers.<p>

U.S. imports of woven apparel ($21 million in 1996) have grown slowly because of the high tariffs on many apparel items. For example, the non-MFN tariffs on certain athletic and ski apparel is 90%, while the MFN tariff is 8.5%. The MFN tariff on many wearing apparel items is ten times the non-MFN rate. Vietnam's potential in the wearing apparel sector is enormous as shown by the import levels in 1995 in Europe ($291 million) and for Japan in 1996 ($390 million). Woven apparel imports into Europe are held in check by low quota levels. Japan has no quotas. U.S. apparel imports will begin to approach those in Europe and Japan when MFN status is granted.<p>

Table 2 best shows Vietnam's potential in several other product sectors. The potential for growth in knit apparel is shown by the quantities exported in 1995 to Europe ($38 million) and in 1996 ($173 million).<p>

Sports bags, backpacks, and similar items should also increase rapidly with MFN status. Imports of these items in 1995 into Europe were $83 million and are projected to reach $71 million into Japan in 1996. Ceramic products and furniture and bedding should show substantial increases with MFN status. Almost $32 million in ceramic products were imported into Europe in 1995. Imports of furniture and bedding were $25 million for Europe in 1995 and are projected to reach $69 million in Japan in 1996.<p>

Current imports into the United States, Europe and Japan provide many of the answers needed to predict Vietnam's future trading patterns with the United States. An open question is how long it will take for U.S. imports from Vietnam to reach the billion dollar levels of Europe and Japan.<p>
