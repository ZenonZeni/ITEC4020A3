<h1>The Marijuana Amotivational Syndrome </h1>

<p><b>A Review of The Research of William Slikker, Jr.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Amotivational Syndrome&quot; was hypothesized as a long
term effect of marijuana use -- that is, it was supposed to be an
effect which occured among people who smoke pot, not when they
were stoned, but all the time. Various studies were done to try
to find &quot;Amotivational Syndrome.&quot; Some claimed success.
Others claimed that there was no such animal. But there was one
trend: the more successful studies were done on young persons. </p>

<p>Slikker, Paule, et al. set out to find the effects of
marijuana smoke on the brain, memory, learning, and motivation.
They found that monkees who smoked even just on weekends did not
develop normal clinical motivation -- defined by the willingness
to work for reward. The studies concentrated on adolescense
specifically for this reason, and were extremely well controlled.
</p>

<p>Does this mean that kids who smoke marijuana are lazy?
Probably not. Rhesus monkees are very similar to humans, though,
and it is very likely, especially given the previous empirical
evidence, that smoking marijuana during adolescense will
temporarily impair specific types of motivational development.
The effect is permanantly reversible and normal motivational
development can be obtained by a 3-12 month period of abstinance
(in monkeys -- no time period for humans is available.) </p>

<p>Slikker did not find &quot;amotivational syndrome&quot; but
something less severe which may be at the root of the common
perception that marijuana smokers are lazy. This is a good thing
because it gives us a better argument *against* the existance of
full blown amotivational syndrome. Among the other things Slikker
found which we can be very excited about was no brain or cellular
damage, an actual stimulation of brain cell development by
marijuana smoking (which would fit with the current knowlege of
increased alpha wave activity and blood flow while stoned), no
permanant effects on memory or mental capacity, and lots of good
reasons why marijuana should be more thoroughly researched rather
than feared. </p>

<p>So instead of being so defensive, read the study -- it is very
useful. </p>
