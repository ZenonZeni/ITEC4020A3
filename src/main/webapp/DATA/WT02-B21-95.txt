&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the past six years that we have been offering trips to Indonesia, Bali has been primarily a jumping off point at the beginning our itineraries.  However, those of our travelers who chose to spend a few days on their own in Bali invariably came back with glowing reports of the island’s serene, emerald green beauty and the peaceful, yet intensely spiritual and colorful Balinese people - and we decided it was high time we created our own special itinerary focusing on this "Land of Waking Dreams."<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This program is a "hands-on" cultural immersion in the daily lives of the Balinese.  We slip into another mode of life - starting the day, as many Balinese do, with yoga.  We wander through markets accompanied by our hosts, who point out and explain the significance and use of myriad colorful wares.  We meander among rice paddies and walk in the beautiful and remote northern highlands in a small group or, if we wish, completely alone - soaking in the ambiance of this lush land.  Not only do we meet master woodcarvers, shadow puppeteers and environmentalists, but we have the opportunity to watch them ply their trade and even to participate in it with them:  as when we try our hand at playing an instrument in a Gamelan orchestra - the heartbeat of Bali; or learn from a talented herbalist who demonstrates the application of traditional medicine.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unique in primarily Muslim Indonesia, the Balinese are mostly Hindu and a focus of our visit will be the important Hindu concept of <I>Tri Hita Karana</I> - the inter-relationship of the people, the gods and the land.  We are provided with, and encouraged to wear, traditional Balinese dress - sorong, sashes and kebaya - as we will join in the celebration of <I>Galungan</I>, Bali’s most important festival.  This will be quite a powerful experience, for it is believed that all the gods, including the supreme deity Sanghyang Widi, return to Bali at this time.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This one-of-a-kind itinerary is possible largely because of our close friend Hans Iluk.  Seven years ago, he decided to make his home in Ubud, the arts and cultural center of Bali, and runs the beautiful and hospitable guesthouse <I>Alam Indah</I>.  Set amongst rice-terraced highlands in a tranquil river valley of Ubud, <I>Alam Indah</I> will be our homebase on this program.  Hans has worked closely with his longtime friends, William Ingram and Jean Howe, to create a program that introduces the Balinese view of life in a personal and participatory way.  Jean and William have been organizing cultural tours in Bali since 1990.  They live in Ubud, with the Balinese family Jean first met in 1987.  Presently, they offer only a few small tours a year.  As Jean says, "We could run tours throughout the year, but then we’d have no time to be with the Balinese, and the Balinese we work with would have no time for their culture."<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After devoting 11 days to Bali, we end our Indonesian experience in Sulawesi’s Torajaland, an equally unique and fascinating place.  The Torajans believe that they originally descended from "Pleiades," and have built homes to resemble the skyships which carried their ancestors to earth.  We explore traditional villages and haunting death cliffs where replicas of the dead, called Tau Taus, stare down at us from carved balconies.  This is a perfect ending to our Indonesian <I>Journey of Waking Dreams</I>.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This in-depth look at the fascinating cultures of Bali and Torajaland necessitates a small group of travelers, and therefore we have limited participation to 17.  Those who join us are guaranteed the kind of specialized and intimate visit which one would expect when visiting a personal friend.  If you are interested in immersing yourself in a <B><I>Journey of Waking Dreams</I></B>, give Kristy a call.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The post-extension to our <B><I>Journey of Waking Dreams</I></B> excursion takes us to Camp Leaky and Tanjung Puting Reserve in South Central Borneo.  The reserve is home to orangutans who have been orphaned due to poaching and natural causes.  Here, they are cared for and taught survival skills in preparation for their release into the wild.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From our accommodation at the Rimba Lodge, we discover an ecologically diverse area of wetlands, lowlands, swamp forest and hardwood rain forest.  A journey upriver by Klotok brings us to nearby Camp Leaky, where Dr. Birute Galdikas conducted her orangutan research project for over 20 years.  En route, we search for kingfishers, hornbills, gibbons and proboscis monkeys.  Led by Hans Iluk, our small group will experience the thrill of seeing orangutans in their natural habitat and learn more about the valuable research and conservation programs of this famous camp.
