<html><hr><head><h2>Transportation of Spent Nuclear Fuel</h2><head>
<hr><p>
<body>A safe, dependable transportation system is a crucial link in both the operation of any proposed
interim storage facility and a permanent geologic repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to accept,
transport, and dispose of spent nuclear fuel.
<p>
Over the last 25 years, approximately 2,500 shipments of spent nuclear fuel have been
transported safely over America's highways, waterways, and railroads. During this time, an
exemplary safety record has been established with no fatalities, injuries, or environmental
damage caused by the radioactive nature of the cargo.
<p>
Several factors have contributed to this success story. The spent nuclear fuel is a solid, ceramic-like material enclosed in metal tubes and shipped dry in rugged containers. These containers are
heavy, sealed, thick-walled, steel structures that safely confine the spent nuclear fuel. These
specially engineered containers are designed to keep their radioactive cargo from being released
into the environment under both normal and off-normal conditions.
<p>
<strong>Testing To Ensure Safety</strong>
<p>
Each shipping container is designed to maintain its integrity under normal transportation
conditions and during hypothetical accident conditions. The containers must provide protection
against radiological release to the environment. The following tests are administered in sequence
and include:<br>
<ul>
<li>          A 9 meter (30-foot) free fall on to an unyielding surface 
<li>          A puncture test allowing the container to free-fall 1 meter (40 inches) onto a steel rod 15  centimeters (6 inches) in diameter 
<li>          A 30-minute, all-engulfing fire at 800 degrees Celsius (1475 degrees Fahrenheit) 
<li>          An 8-hour immersion under 0.9 meter (3 feet) of water. 
</ul><p>
In addition, the undamaged package must be subjected to a one-hour immersion under 200
meters (655 feet) of water.
<p>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is responsible for certification of the package design. The Department of
Transportation (DOT) has established regulations for handling shipping containers, labeling
containers and placarding transport vehicles for identification purposes, driver training and
certification; and highway routing.

<strong>What If An Accident Occurs?</strong>
<p>
Radioactive waste transport is controlled by a comprehensive regulatory framework and has an
excellent safety record.  Because there is a chance that an accident involving a radioactive
shipment could occur, emergency response plans will be in place to handle any situation that
could arise. The key to effective emergency response is quality training and preparation.  The
DOE will provide technical and financial assistance for training public safety officials through
whose jurisdictions the Department transports spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste.
<p>
Routing is an important issue because it is related to a variety of OCRWM activities including
advance notification, emergency response preparedness, inspection and enforcement, and risk
management. Until such time as a Federal receiving facility is designated pursuant to existing or
future legislation, specific routes and number of shipments cannot be determined. Once
shipments of spent nuclear fuel begin, the Department of Energy will follow existing DOT
regulations which generally limit shipments to either the interstate highway systems, a state-designated alternative route, or both.  Rail shipments will be routed using current rail and motor carrier practices. 
<p>
As the Department develops the Federal waste management system, it is committed to providing
safe shipments of spent nuclear fuel across the nation's highways and railroads.
