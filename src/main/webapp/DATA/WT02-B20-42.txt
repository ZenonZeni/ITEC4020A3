  This monograph presents four chapters on cultural and linguistic diversity in 
special education from the perspectives of three ethnic groups--African 
Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Mexican Americans, respectively.  The 
first chapter is titled "Education Reform and Service Delivery to African-
American Students," by Festus E. Obiakor and others.  This chapter focuses on 
issues related to education reform as embodied in the General Education 
Initiative and service delivery to African-American students with disabilities. 
The second chapter is "Ecobehavioral Assessment: A New Methodology for 
Evaluating Instruction for Exceptional Culturally and Linguistically Diverse 
Students" (Carmen Arreaga-Mayer and others).  This chapter reviews the current 
bilingual special education efficacy literature, offers a prototype 
ecobehavioral approach, and reports on a pilot study with 36 elementary 
students (in 26 classrooms) utilizing this approach.  The third chapter is 
"Assessment of Asian and Pacific Islander Students for Gifted Programs" (Li-
Rong Lilly Cheng and others).  This chapter briefly describes the relevant 
cultural and ethnic groups, examines academic performance of Asian and Pacific 
Islanders in San Diego (California) as it relates to referral of this 
population to gifted programs, and draws implications for practitioners in the 
form of recommended multidisciplinary practices.  The fourth chapter, 
"Nonstandardized Instruments for the Assessment of Mexican-American Children 
for Gifted/Talented Programs" (Jaime H. Garcia), discusses assessment 
strategies that provide qualitative data for the identification of gifted 
Mexican-American students.  These strategies are grouped into four categories: 
student production, informant data, language and cognitive style data, and data 
organization systems.  (Each chapter contains extensive references.) (DB)<BR>

This pamphlet describes grant projects funded in 1992 and 1993 under the
Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program.  The 34
projects are arranged by state; for each project, information provided includes
the grantee name and address, project director name and telephone number,
target grade level, target population, grant period, funding level, and summary
of activities.  Activities funded through this program include grants to assist
state and local education agencies, institutions of higher education, and other
public and private agencies and organizations to meet the needs of talented and
gifted students; to create a national research center on gifted and talented
education; and to highlight the needs and concerns of gifted/talented students. 
Projects receive priority if they serve youngsters who have limited English
skills, are disabled, or are at risk of being unrecognized and underserved. 
Priority is also given to projects that improve services for talented students
in an entire state or region.  (JDD)<BR>

Target Audience: Practitioners<BR>
This digest is adapted from Linda Cohen's publication, "Meeting the Needs of
Gifted and Talented Minority Language Students." It explores the controversy
surrounding the underrepresentation of minority language students in gifted and
talented programs and makes recommendations for more suitable assessment
techniques and program models.  Addressed are the following questions: (1) Why
are minority language students underrepresented in programs for gifted and
talented students? (2) What are some commonly used techniques for the
identification of gifted and talented minority language students? and (3) What
types of programs are available for gifted and talented students, and are they
suitable for minority language students who are selected to participate?
Specifically described are enrichment programs, parent involvement programs,
acceleration or honors programs, and mentor programs.  The following
recommendations are made: broaden the concept of giftedness; expand research on
giftedness and minority language students; employ more well-rounded assessment
techniques; increase staff awareness of their potential for developing a gifted
and talented program; explore various program models; and increase awareness of
different ways giftedness may be manifested in different populations.  Includes
17 references.  (DB)<BR>

This document is a "theme" issue of a quarterly serial publication.  It
focuses on identifying and serving gifted children from diverse populations. 
The first article, "Eliminating Four Barriers to the Identification of Gifted
Minority Students" by Mary Frasier, notes that: (1) not every impoverished home
is illiterate; (2) limited opportunities for learning should not be assumed to
restrict the child's achievement; (3) there are common mental traits of
giftedness regardless of the child's background; and (4) giftedness may
manifest itself differently in different children.  The second article, "Gifted
Learning Disabled Students: Questions and Answers," by Anne J. Udall, answers
questions concerning the characteristics of such students, their prevalence,
and the best ways to meet their curriculum needs.  Next, Mary T. Kolesinski in
"The Bilingual Gifted: Viable Strategies for Effective Programming" proposes
strategies for improving the identification process and teaching strategies to
address the special needs of these students.  In the fourth paper, "An Update
on the Javits Project: Identifying and Serving Disadvantaged Gifted Youth,"
Evelyn L. Hiatt presents preliminary information on the Texas Student Portfolio
(TSP), a measure designed to provide unbiased assessment of characteristics
associated with gifted students, especially as they pertain to critical and
creative thinking.  (The TSP is part of a 3-year project undertaken by the
Texas Education Agency with funding from the Jacob K. Javits Gifted Students
Education Act of 1988.  The project's purpose is to fulfill the grant's
objective to investigate nontraditional approaches to identifying and serving
underrepresented populations in programs for the gifted.) Finally, Evelyn Hiatt
and Jeanette Covington respond to common questions on identifying and serving
diverse populations.  (DB)<BR>
