<b>OBJECTIVE</b>
		A scientific research and development position specializing
in experimental plasma physics and computers.<p>
<p>
<B>PROFILE</B>
A creative researcher with a versatile background in both engineering and
experimental plasma physics.  An enterprising and through engineer capable of
providing cost effective and user friendly solutions.  Adaptable to a variety
of research tasks.<P>
<b>RESEARCH SKILLS:</b><p>
<b></b>*	Conducted and participated in experimental studies of turbulent
plasmas, plasma-material interactions, and plasma source development.<p>
*	Analyzed two dimensional turbulent dynamics in plasmas 
using both Fourier and
Wavelet Transforms, cross correlation analysis of spatially resolved plasma
turbulence, and computer visualization techniques.<p>
<p>
<b>TECHNICAL SKILLS:</b><p>
*	Lead the design and fabrication of custom data acquisition system for
turbulence measurements.  Project included an array of probes, analog to
digital converters, and computer interface.<p>
*	Extensive programming experience in Fortran, C, and IDL.<p>
*	Designed and developed a plasma turbulence analysis program in IDL that is
currently used at five different plasma physics laboratories.<p>
*	System Management of 10 VMS and Unix computers and 20 Macintosh computers;
familiar with CAMAC data acquisition hardware.<p>
<p>
<b>ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS:</b><p>
*	Lead and managed a $100,000 hardware fabrication project.
Delivered 20MHz, 64 channel custom data acquisition system for plasma 
turbulence measurements within budget.<p>
<p>
<b>COMMUNICATIONS SKILLS:</b><p>
*	Experienced presenter of scientific data in both poster and oral
form.<P>
*	Experience in electronic publishing of material on the World Wide Web.<p>
