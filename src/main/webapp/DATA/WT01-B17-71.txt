<HR>
<P>
        Each of our cancer protocols is highly individualized, says Nicholas
Gonzalez, M.D., a classically trained immunologist now among the nation's
pre&Icirc;minent practitioners of alternative cancer treatment with a busy
clinic in New York City. &quot;It is essential, though, that each patient comply
100% with their individual program in order for them to survive.&quot;
<P>
        When they do, the results can be quite astonishing-an estimated 80%
success rate, Dr. Gonzalez claims. Add to this the fact that most of the
patients that show up in Dr. Gonzalez' Park Avenue offices have received their
&quot;death sentences&quot; in so many months-to-live from their conventional
cancer specialists, after having &quot;failed&quot; with chemotherapy and
radiation. Failed?-not from Dr. Gonzalez' viewpoint. For him, these
people have barely begun the real struggle against their cancer, the one with
the positive outcome.
<P>
        In some respects this dramatic case study stands for the powerful healing
possibilities of the Gonzalez approach, or for any alternative cancer treatment
that genuinely is open to an alternative outcome, which is to say, remission and
life after cancer. A lawyer, age 28, had advanced leukemia; her doctors said she
had only a few days left to live. Three months after starting the Gonzalez
program, she was still alive; in fact, she was much better. A year
later-some 362 days after the &quot;few days&quot; she supposedly had
left to live-she was in complete remission and back at work.
<P>
        The Gonzalez program has 6 main features.  First, appropriate diet, which
means one of 10 basic diets with 94 variations depending on the metabolic type
of the cancer patient and of the cancer itself. Second, intensive nutritional
support, which means a huge amount of vitamin and mineral supplements. Third,
proto-morphogen support-these are pills made from raw beef organs and
glands. Fourth, general digestive aids, including pepsin and hydrochloric acid.
Fifth, pancreatic enzyme therapy, taken orally to help liquefy tumors. Sixth,
detoxification, to help the body eliminate the unhealthy abundance of toxins and
waste products as the tumors decompose.
<P>
As Cheryl Wilkens mentions in the accompanying article,  much of the Gonzalez program is based on the earlier work of William Donald Kelley, D.D.S.  In the 1960s, faced with his own pancreatic cancer, Kelly, by profession a dentist, figured out a bold new approach to cancer treatment based on an understanding of how the body metabolizes protein. It seemed to him that cancer might be caused by the body's inability to handle protein caused by inadequate amounts of proteolytic enzymes in the pancreas.
<P>
Apparently, the pancreas secretes these special enzymes into the bloodstream where, under normal healthy conditions, they digest and deactivate potentially cancerous cells. Kelley also realized that each person has  a unique biochemical, nutritional con-dition, so any approach, if it is to be effective, must be individually tailored. Even so, there are some general broad categories which he called the 10 metabolic types,  and these become the basis for the individual nutrition plans.
<P>
Is there proof all this works? Yes, a fair amount, but Dr. Gonzalez is now recruiting patients with pancreatic cancer to take part in a new clinical study to test his therapies. Years ago, Dr. Gonzalez studied some of Kelly's pancreatic cancer patients to see how long they survived. Normally, pancreatic cancer comes with a 5 year survival probability. Dr. Gonzalez found that those patients who followed the program to the letter survived 9 years, compared to 8 months for those who did so only partially, and 67 days, for those who started it then quit.  "The ultimate goal for all of us is to try and get clinical trials so we can get our therapies tested," Gonzalez says. "Then if it really does work, the world will have the facts to confirm it."
