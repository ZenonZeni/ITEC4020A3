<A NAME="myth"></A><H2>APRIL'S MYTH OF THE MONTH</H2>
<P>The editors of the Dirt are on a mission to dispel gardening myths. This month we want to point out a fallacy perpetuated by those city slickers at the big Madison Avenue advertising agencies.
No doubt, dear reader, you have seen those TV ads featuring someone standing in a field of wildflowers, sneezing their heads off and complaining of itchy, watery eyes. The impression is that big beautiful flowers are the culprits behind the allergy attacks. This simply is not the case.
The serious offenders are plants with inconspicuous flowers which depend largely on wind to spread their pollen. (the actual allergen) This group includes many common trees and grasses. The wind spreads the pollen everywhere, including your house,  your car, your office and finally up your nose and in your eyes.
Showy flowers depend on bees and other insects to spread their pollen. Botanists theorize that flowering plants have evolved attractive colors precisely to increase their prospects for pollination and thus reproduction.
So go ahead and smell the flowers. It's something else that's making you sneeze.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Chicken manure</A> has gotten a bad rap.  Many gardeners believe that it is likely to burn plants.
Truth is, any fresh manure contains salts that can dehydrate plants, causing them to appear burnt.
Well-rotted, composted manure, like all of our <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Whitney Farms products</A>, applied judiciously (i.e., don't plant anything directly into large amounts of it) is non-burning and an excellent, even essential, ingredient to <AHREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/garden.htm">gardening</A> success.  Manure improves <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/soil.htm">soil</A> texture and makes it easier to work, it stimulates beneficial soil organisms, which makes the nutrients more available to the plants.  It is important to remember that manure has what is called a  high mineralization rate (which is how fast the nutrients it contains become available to plants).  For example, only about half the nutrients in steer manure become available the first year.  By comparison, 90% of the nutrients in chicken manure are available to plants in the first year.  So, it is important to use chicken manure judiciously.
The main advantage of chicken manure is that it is rich in nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium in a readily available form.  Like all of our manure, <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/product.htm">Whitney Farms Chicken Manure</A> has been composted and has a nutrient analysis of 3-2-2, which makes it specially suited to the nutritional needs of annuals and <A HREF="http://www.whitneyfarm.com/veggie.htm">vegetables.</A> Use it sparingly, spreading 1/4-1 inch of manure over the garden area and tilling it in to a depth of 4-8 inches.  As a nutrient-rich top dressing, spread up to 1/2 inch of manure around the drip line of well established plants.  Remember, the nutrients chicken manure contains become available quickly, so if in doubt, use a little less.
Some of our competitors have been critical of our use of dried poultry waste (DPW) in our fertilizers; they call it a cheap filler.*  We could not disagree more strongly.  The low moisture DPW we use can last up to two years in the soil according to Ross Penhallegon from the Lane County, Oregon, Extension Office.  In addition our DPW contains 4% nitrogen, 3% phosphorous, and 2% potash as well as trace minerals.  We feel that it is a quality product that keeps our products affordable, while helping poultry producers deal with a substantial waste problem.  In short, it is a well-balanced source of long lasting plant nutrients that produces excellent results at a moderate cost.</P>
