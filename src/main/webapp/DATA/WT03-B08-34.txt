Photoluminescence
in Thin Films

Photoluminescence has been detected in thin films of partially
oxidized silicon (Si) nanoclusters by scientists at the Lawrence
Livermore National Lab (Livermore, CA 94550; Tel: 510/422-1100).
The scientists, reports Lloyd L. Chase, synthesized Si nanoclusters
with average diameters of only a few nanometers (nm) using thermal
vaporization of Si in an argon (Ar) gas background.  The first
monolayer of Si nanoclusters was deposited directly onto the basal
plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, and the layer was
exposed to oxygen (O2) for five minutes.  Although, additional
monolayers were added until the film thickness reached about 250
nm, no photoluminescence was observed.

Post annealing the film in O2 produced a white photoluminescence,
which peaked at about 600 nm.  The photoluminescence increased in
intensity as a function of annealing time and temperature up to
850(C without any accompanying shift in wavelength.  The decay time
was less than five nanoseconds.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed extensive oxidation of
the film, and the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of the film
showed a strong resemblance to the optical absorption curve of bulk
Si, except for an increase in absorption at wavelengths longer than
375 nm.  The scientists attribute the photoluminescence to the
recombination of carriers in localized defect centers in the
silicon oxide layer.

Optronics Improves
Reflectance, Durability

Optronic Labs, Inc. (4470 35th St., Orlando, FL 32811; Tel:
407/422-3171 or 800/899-3171, Fax: 407/648-5412) has commercialized
its line of Optolon diffuse reflectance coatings.  William A.
Schneider, VP and director of sales and operations, says, "Unlike
other sprayable coatings, Optolon materials are extremely rugged
and washable."  The products are claimed to have a higher
reflectance and better mechanical properties than competitive
products.

Optolon products are available for a wide variety of custom and OEM
applications requiring highly reflective, diffuse, durable
coatings.  Uses include integrating spheres, diffuse reflectance
standards, diffuse reflectance targets, uniform radiance sources,
lamp cavities and reflectors, diffusers and high efficiency
coatings for lamp fixtures and baffles.

Two versions of Optolon coatings are manufactured.  Optolon 1
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based coating is useable at 250-
2,500 nanometers (nm), and Optolon 2 is a barium sulfate-based
coating useable over the more limited 300-1,100 nm range.

AT&T Develops
Stable Facet Films

Silicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable for use as nonhermetic laser
facet coatings have been produced by researchers at AT&T Corp. (600
Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ 07974; Tel: 201/582-3000).  Naresh
Chand relates, in U.S. Patent 5,440,575, that the new films have
low levels of cracks, voids and particulate contamination and that
they are stable in ambient atmospheres.

The surfaces of nearly all semiconductor lasers must be protected
and/or modified.  Although dielectric films suitable for some
devices are widely used, e.g., silicon dioxide (SiO2) on silicon
(Si), there is a need for a dielectric that is mechanically and
chemically stable and free of pinholes, cracks, particulates and
voids.  It should also have good adhesion, be highly resistant to
moisture penetration and be adaptable for use as a semiconductor
laser facet coating regardless of emission wavelength.

A number of materials, including yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ),
have been proposed, but end up with shortcomings, including poor
reproducibility with respect to refractive index and/or mechanical
stress and contamination with particulates.  In addition,
conventional facet coatings are not normally stable in the ambient
atmosphere, causing changes in laser properties and premature laser
failure.

Because of the problems associated with conventional facet
coatings, nearly all such devices are packaged in hermetic, gas-
filled enclosures.  These hermetic lasers are widely used in
optical fiber communications, optical interconnects, sensors, and
printing.  Hermetic enclosures add to the complexity of
manufacturing processes, reduces yield, and increases the cost of
the devices.  The AT&T researchers sought a highly reliable laser
facet coating stable in the ambient atmosphere.

The AT&T scientists discovered that under the right processing
conditions, high quality silicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable for
use as laser facet coatings could be produced.  The key to their
work was the use of a deposition by molecular beam technique
instead of conventional thermal evaporation processes.  The surface
layer of the film is nearly always SiO2, but this layer normally
represents only about 10% of the entire film in most cases.  If
particular reflectivities are needed, the SiOx film can be combined
with layers of other dielectric or semiconductor materials
deposited using the same technique.

Scintillating Product

Poly-Optical Products, Inc. (17475 Gillette Ave., Irvine, CA 92714;
Tel: 714/250-8557) has introduced a line of scintillating optical
fibers.  Sometimes called fluorescent or light collecting fibers,
the new products include a polystyrene-based core and a polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) cladding.  Cladding thickness is about 3% of
the fiber diameter, reports Poly-Optical's Karen Neal.

The fibers conduct and absorb light and emit it in concentrated
form at both ends of the fiber.  Common uses include decoration and
radiation detection.  The numerical aperture of the products is
0.58, and operating temperature is -20(C to +50(.  Available colors
include blue, green, red, and orange.

Low Cost Video
Link Is Ready

Physical Optics Corp. (POC, 20600 Gramercy Place, Bldg. 100,
Torrance, CA 90501; Tel: 310/320-3088, Fax: 310/320-8067, email:
pocfiber@aol.com) has introduced a reliable, low cost, video link
that transmits one NTSC RS-170 video signal from a camera to a
remote location via fiber optic cable.  Designed primarily for
process control, security and surveillance applications, the
trademarked Fiber View POC100 system includes one transmitter and
one receiver and uses highly linear amplitude modulation with
automatic gain control circuitry to provide adjustment free
transmission of the video signal.

The inexpensive, single channel fiber optic video transmission
system, priced at about $400, eliminates electromagnetic and radio
frequency interference and ground loop problems typically
associated with coaxial cable transmission.  The high-performance,
light emitting diode (LED)-based, 850 nanometer (nm) Fiber View
POC100 system can extend the transmission range of a video signal
up to one mile. It features a robust bandwidth range of 2 hertz
(Hz) to 10 megahertz (MHz).

Two-color LED status indicators enable the user to monitor
activity.  Housed in modular enclosures, these compact (1.25 inches
high x 2.00 inches wide x 4.00 inches deep) systems can be
installed quickly and easily.  The units consume less than 150
milliamps (mA) and operate from either 12-24 AC or 15-24 DC power.

Energy Pumped
into MRI Diagnosis

Researchers are using high power diode lasers from Opto Power Corp.
(OPC, 3321 E. Global Loop, Tucson, AZ 85706; Tel: 520/746-1234,
Fax: 520/294-3300, email: opc_info@ix.netcom.com) in a new, gas-
based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure that may detect
emphysema, asthma, pulmonary embolisms, and other lung diseases
that have been difficult or impossible to diagnose with
conventional proton MRI.  Employing this experimental "laser-
polarized" gas MRI method, physicists at Princeton University and
scientists with Duke University's Center for In Vivo Microscopy
acquired the first high resolution images of a human lung, reports
OPC's Merrill Apter.

Since they are filled with air and not water, a human lung is
difficult to image effectively using proton MRI because they lack
the necessary hydrogen atoms to produce a resolute picture.  While
x-rays of the lungs can show some accumulation of fluid and scar
tissue, their exposures are too short to reveal porous lung tissue.


Other diagnostic procedures for imaging the lungs, such as
ventilation scans with radioactive isotopes, expose the patient to
significant levels of radiation and often fail to produce
sufficiently high-resolution images.  The noble gases used in the
laser-polarized gas MRI technique--usually helium (He) or xenon
(Xe)--are inert and nonradioactive and therefore are harmless
inhalants, posing no health risk to the patient.

Tuned to 795 nanometers (nm), the diode laser stimulates an atomic
transition in the alkali metal rubidium (Rb) which is driven into
a vapor in a small oven heated to about 180C.  The Rb vapor
becomes polarized in the process and subsequently transfers some of
the polarization to the nuclei of 3He or 129Xe during gas phase
collisions in a 50-100 cubic centimeter (cc) sealed cell.  After
sufficient polarization is generated in the noble gas it can then
be cooled to room temperature (condensing the rubidium vapor) and
inhaled into the lungs for imaging.

Physicist Hunter Middleton of Princeton University (223 Jadwin
Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544; Tel: 609/258-2843, Fax: 609/258-1124,
email: midleton@princeton.edu) describes how the research team
relies on intense light from OPC's high power, diode lasers to
produce the required volumes of polarized gas.  "The highly
polarized state of the noble gas allows images taken with the new
MRI technique to be generated in seconds, compared to the minutes
often required for conventional MRIs," says Middleton.  When the
project began they were using five sets of large titanium:sapphire
laser systems pumped by argon ion lasers to achieve the required
levels of polarization, but it was found that they were too
expensive and inefficient.

Turning to diode lasers, they were able to dramatically lower their
operating costs. The compact 20-watt open heatsink diode laser
initially employed in the new MRI technique was priced at about
$4,000 and used less than 80 watts of electrical input power.  By
comparison, the argon ion and titanium:sapphire lasers together
were priced in the neighborhood of $500,000 and used about 250 kW
of electricity to produce the same output power. "The
titanium:sapphire setup was so big it required a separate room,"
explains Middleton.  "The diode laser array, on the other hand, is
so small and efficient that it allows us to move the laser
polarized gas MRI station easily from the laboratory to a hospital
environment equipped with only a standard 110 volt wall outlet."

The 20-watt array was more than adequate for imaging the lungs of
a guinea pig, but couldn't produce enough polarized gas necessary
for human tests.  For the first test of a human lung, a 120-watt
array produced nearly 1 liter of polarized gas in 4 hours.  "Though
the spectral distribution, or emission bandwidth, of the diode
laser array (about 2.5 nm) is much broader than that of
titanium:sapphire lasers and exceeds the absorption line of the
rubidium as well, it's nevertheless extremely efficient in this
application," says Middleton.  "We believe that imaging the
function of the lungs and other organs and tissues filled with air
spaces using laser polarized gas has vast potential and may evolve
into a nice complement to conventional proton MRI."

DOE's Nonproliferation
Program Uses Device

Tunable infrared (IR) lasers under construction at Deacon Research,
Inc. (2440 Embarcadero Way, Palo Alto, CA 94303-3313; Tel: 415/493-
6100) will be used in Dept. of Energy (DOE) nuclear
nonproliferation program.  Douglas Bramford believes that such
devices are essential because of their ability to remotely detect
effluents resulting from the processing of nuclear material.
Conventional devices are tabletop laboratory models not easily
adaptable to deployment on an airplane or in an inspector's
briefcase.

The Deacon Research project will involve the building of a compact,
tunable IR laser source based on the diode laser pumping of a new
nonlinear optical material, periodically poled lithium niobate
(PPLN).  The pump laser and nonlinear crystal can be integrated
into a small package with no mechanical tuning elements.

A device with the required spectral properties--a narrow bandwidth
and a wide range--can then be manufactured.  Applications outside
the nuclear field may include environmental monitoring,
manufacturing process control, medical diagnostics and analytical
chemistry.

Fuji Photo Film Co.
Improves Accuracy

A highly accurate laser diode pumped solid laser has been built by
engineers at Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. (2-26-30 Nishi-Azabu,
Minato-Ku, Tokyo 106, Japan; Tel: 3/34062111, Fax: 3/34062395).
Hisashi Ohtusuka reports that the temperature in the region inside
the case housing the optical module is kept constant, preventing
the output power and the wavelength of the produced beam from
fluctuating.

Laser diode pumped solid lasers include a solid laser medium to
which a rare earth metal, e.g., neodymium (Nd) is added.  The
medium is pumped by a semiconductor laser, or laser diode.  In
order for a laser beam from such a device to have as short a
wavelength as possible, a crystal of a nonlinear optical material
is located in the resonator of the laser.  The nonlinear optical
material alters the wavelength of the laser beam.

The temperature of the optical module of such a device is
ordinarily kept at a constant level in order to keep the output
power of the laser diode and the wavelength of the laser beam from
fluctuating.  This temperature is normally maintained by placing
the optical module on the surface of an electronic temperature
adjusting device.

The temperature in the vicinity of the laser diode or nonlinear
optical crystal is detected and adjusted as needed.  The problem is
that when both the optical module and the cooling device are housed
in the same case, the temperature adjustments are often not
accurate enough to keep the laser diode output and the laser beam
wavelength from fluctuating.

The optical module of the Fuji Photo Film laser includes a laser
diode, a solid laser crystal which is excited by the beam produced
by the laser diode, and a resonator.  All three components are
placed in an inner case.  An outer case contains the temperature
adjustment device, temperature sensors, control circuitry and the
inner case.  The new construction makes it easier to maintain an
accurate temperature in the optical module, which in turn increases
the accuracy of the laser diode output and the laser beam
wavelength.  U.S. Patent 5,446,750 details the Fuji Photo Film
work.

LiNbO3 Improves
Disk Drives, Printers

A waveguide layer has been formed on the surface of a lithium
niobate (LiNbO3) electrooptical material by scientists at Hitachi
Koki Co., Ltd (1060 Takeda, Katsuta City 312, Ibaraki, Japan; Tel:
292/738111, Fax: 292/741730).  Keiji Kataoka reports that the layer
is incorporated in a light control device that includes a light
diffraction device mounted on the surface of the electrooptical
material and electrodes on the front and back surfaces.  The new
device, described in U.S. Patent 5,444,567, is intended for use in
laser printers and optical disk drives.

Some conventional light control devices take advantage of an
electrooptical effect in which the refractive index of a
transparent medium is altered by applying an electric field.  In
one type of these devices, light is directed through an
electrooptical material.  In the other type, light is directed
through a waveguide layer formed on an electrooptical material.

In devices of the first type, an electrooptical material is formed
in the shape of a triangular prism, and electrodes completely cover
the opposite major surfaces.  When a voltage is applied to the
electrodes, an electric field is generated.  Ingoing light is
applied to the prism, and outgoing light is deflected by the
electric field.

In devices of the second type, a waveguide layer on the upper
surface of the electrooptical material.  Electrodes are formed on
an exposed surface of the waveguide layer, and when a voltage is
applied between the electrodes an electric field is generated along
the exposed surface.  Light passing between the electrodes is
deflected.

To produce a large deflection of the outgoing light in the first
type light control devices, the electric field must be increased,
and the beam diameter of the incoming light must also be increased.
Also, in order to obtain a large electric field with a small
applied voltage, the thickness of the electrooptical material must
be reduced.  As a result, in order to produce a large deflection of
the outgoing light, a transversely extended oval shaped light must
be made to enter a relatively thin electrooptical material.  The
problem is that it is difficult to attain this configuration.

To cause a large deflection of the outgoing light in the second
type of light control devices, the electric field intensity must be
increased and the width of the light must also be increased.  In
order to increase the electric field intensity, the interval
between the electrodes is decreased.  The problem here is that when
the width of the light is increased, the electrode interval should
also be increased.  As a result, it is very difficult to produce a
large deflection of light.

The goal of the Hitachi scientists was to build a light control
device in which a large deflection angle or a large change in the
light focusing position can be achieved with only a small applied
voltage.  The waveguide laser was formed by titanium (Ti) diffusion
on the surface of the LiNbO3.  Incoming light is led by a grating
into the waveguide layer and becomes directed light.  Since the new
light deflection device is effective in controlling the light path,
it can be applied to a wide range of devices.

In a laser printer the size of dots recorded on the recording
material must be rapidly changed so that half tone recording can be
accurately performed.  New light control devices can increase the
number of gradations from black to white, improving half tone
pictures.

Achieving Stability
Over Longer Times

Optical waveguides with improved stability over extended periods of
time have been constructed by scientists at NEC Corp. (5-7-1 Shiba,
Minato Ku, Tokyo 100, Japan; Tel: 3/34541111).  Naoki Kitamura and
Hiroshi Nishimoto disclosed that one of the new NEC devices
includes two optical waveguides formed in lithium niobate (LiNbO3)
substrate.  A blocking layer is formed on the device to block the
diffusion of lithium (Li) ions from the substrate, and a silicon
dioxide (SiO2) buffer layer is formed on the blocking layer.  The
electrodes, from which operating voltages are supplied, cover each
coupling part of the two waveguides via the blocking and buffer
layers.

Conventional waveguide optical switches fabricated on a LiNbO3
crystal substrate have low light absorption, low loss, and good
efficiency due to their high electrooptical effect.  In such
devices, a buffer layer is formed on an LiNbO3 substrate, which
includes two titanium (Ti)-diffused waveguides.  Metallic
electrodes are formed on a coupling portion of each waveguide via
the buffer layer.

The buffer layer prevents light propagating along the waveguides
from being absorbed by the electrodes.  SiO2 is used for the buffer
layer because its refraction index of 1.45 is smaller than the 2.2
refractive index of the LiNbO3 substrate and because SiO2 exhibits
low light absorption.  When the buffer layer's refractive index is
small, it is more feasible to reduce its thickness to prevent the
absorption of light than it would be for a material with a large
refractive index.

When switching voltages are applied to the electrodes, an external
electric field concentrates on the buffer layer because the
dielectric constant of the buffer layer is smaller than that of the
substrate.  The electric field in the substrate is relatively
small.  The magnitude of the switching voltages needed for
switching and modulation becomes higher for larger thicknesses of
the buffer layer.

The small refractive index and extremely low absorption of light of
SiO2 makes it the best known material for the buffer layer.  The
problem is that when a DC voltage is applied between electrodes, Li
ions, diffused from the substrate into the buffer layer during
fabrication, are pulled by the electric field and collected under
the electrodes.  As a result, an electric field counter to the
external electric field is generated between the electrodes.

The magnitude of the counter electric field increases as the total
number of ions increases because SiO2 has a high ion conductivity
despite its relatively high electric insulating property.  If the
externally applied voltages are kept constant, the resultant
electric field applied to the waveguides is reduced by the
generation of the counter electric field, causing a deterioration
of the device characteristics.  This shift in operating voltage
point for switching or modulating operation, or DC drift, becomes
a problem when putting the device into practical use.

The key to the NEC device, disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,479,552, is
the blocking layer formed to block the diffusion of lithium (Li)
ions from the substrate.  Suitable materials for the blocking layer
include silicon (Si), silicon (tri-) tetranitride (S3N4), and
magnesium fluoride (MgF2).

Interactive Holography
Will Be Evaluated

American Propylaea Corp. (555 S. Woodward, Birmingham, MI 48009;
Tel: 810/642-7000) has been awarded a $100,000 research contract by
the U.S. Air Force to evaluate the integration of interactive
holography in manufacturing.  James Fischbach, president and CEO,
reports that the contract represents Phase 1 of a projected 15-
phase $200 million project if Phase 1 is successful.  Phase 2 would
involve $750,000, and Phase 3 would be worth $5 million.

American Propylaea, which developed the world's first full color
commercial hologram in 1993, scored a major breakthrough in 1994
when it achieved a 42 inch x 45 inch, full motion, true color
holographic display system, the largest yet developed.  Fischbach
predicts that holography will be a $5 billion per year business
within 10 years and identifies the automotive, entertainment,
medical, and retail markets as those with the greatest potential.

Fischbach says that interactive holography could make it possible
for automakers to cut design and development time by 50%, enabling
them to bring new car models to market in under 20 months, compared
with the present 42 months in the U.S. and 36 months in Japan.
Holography could also reduce the need for exploratory surgery and
assist in the training of surgeons, enabling them to view 3-D
information in free space in front of a monitor screen to help them
detect and locate abnormalities and rehearse operations.

Coherent, Uniphase in
License Agreement

Coherent, Inc. (5100 Patrick Henry Dr., Box 54980, Santa Clara, CA
95056-0980; Tel: 408/764-4000) has signed a license and asset
purchase agreements with Uniphase Corp. (163 Baypointe Pkwy., San
Jose, CA 95134; Tel:408/434-1800).  Under the terms of the license
agreement, Uniphase obtained a limited, nonexclusive sublicense for
fundamental solid state laser technology.  In exchange, Coherent
acquired the assets of Uniphase's diode laser operation in
Torrance, CA.

"This license gives us access to a critical technology, which will
allow Uniphase to move forward more aggressively with its solid
state laser programs," says Kevin Kalkhoven, president and CEO of
Uniphase.  "Uniphase can now better focus its resources on its core
businesses, our newly acquired telecommunications operation,
Uniphase Telecommunications Products; our semiconductor equipment
subsidiary, Ultrapointe; as well as our green and blue micro solid
state laser program."

"This is an important strategic acquisition for Coherent," says
Bernard Couillaud, VP and general manager of the Coherent Laser
Group.  "The addition of semiconductor laser technology to our
diode pumped solid state business, which has been strengthened by
the acquisitions of Adlas GmbH and the nontelecommunications part
of Amoco Technology, will allow Coherent to expand its leadership
position, especially in the medical and OEM markets.  Development
of an internal capability will enable us to move very quickly into
some proprietary laser diode applications."

Coherent's product lines will be directed toward supplying the OEM
and medical markets with a broad range of laser diode devices, and
the company says that it intends to continue buying laser diodes
from outside suppliers.

Laser diodes are made from aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) and
indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) using semiconductor manufacturing
technology.  They operate at 600-1,000 nanometers (nm) with up to
15 watts of power.  Because of their small size and high
efficiency, laser diodes are ideal for certain types of OEM and
medical applications and are incorporated into other laser devices
as well.

AT&T Wins
German Contract

AT&T Corp. (600 Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ 07974; Tel: 201/582-
3000) has been awarded an estimated $10 million (14 million DM)
contract to supply fiber optic cable to Deutsche Telekom, Europe's
largest telecommunications company.

The fiber cable will be used mainly to help upgrade the former East
Germany's telecommunications infrastructure, and will be part of
Deutsche Telekom's optical passive access line (OPAL '96) network.
"This contract is an important win for Network Systems," says
Detlef Linssen of AT&T.  "This contract underscores our commitment

Growth Predicted
to End of Decade

The U.S. market for laser materials and components, currently
believed to be $551.3 million, is forecast to grow at an annual
rate of 9.8% and reach $879.4 million in 2000, says a new BCC
business opportunity report.  As diode lasers experience rapid
growth in a variety of applications, components for these lasers
are expected to show the greatest gains in sales.  Laser materials
and equipment such as chillers and power supplies should also
experience substantial growth through the end of this decade.

The world market for laser materials and components is estimated by
BCC to currently stand at $1,059.3 million.  The world market is
projected to grow at an average annual growth rate of 9.1% to
$1,637 in 2000.  The U.S. dominates the world laser materials and
components market, accounting for some 40% of total sale, followed
by Europe and the Pacific region.  Countries in the Pacific region
are expected to experience the highest average annual growth rates
in sales, 10.3%.  In the next few years, the Pacific region is
expected to replace Europe as the second largest market.

Growth in sales of laser materials and components is highly
dependent on the sales of the laser systems with which they are
used.  Laser markets that are expanding rapidly include material
processing, medical therapy and telecommunications.  The research
area, traditionally a major consumer of laser components, is in a
period of flux.

While some research areas are being slashed due to military
cutbacks, research into lasers is expected to continue at a steady
pace.  Lasers have become key components of advanced weapons
systems, and military spending in this area should not decline as
rapidly as in other areas.  Nevertheless, sales of laser materials
and components for research applications are expected to grow at a
rate significantly slower than those for other applications.  As a
result, component manufacturers will have to more aggressively
target industrial customers in the future.

The report analyzes five major market segments: laser materials,
optical components, equipment, instruments, and diode laser
components.  Laser materials include laser crystals, gases and dyes
used in solid state lasers, as well as optical substrates and
coatings which form the basis of optical components.  Sales in each
of these areas should experience average annual growth rates of
about 8% as demand for solid state lasers and their associated
optical components continues to expand.  Particular strength should
occur in sales of tunable laser materials which have made
considerable inroads into the scientific market.

Optical components include lenses, mirrors, prisms and beam
splitters, windows, filters, fiber optics, and modulators and
deflectors.  As key elements of laser systems, lenses, mirrors, and
fibers are the largest markets in this segment.  Sales of these
components should match sales of the lasers in which they are used
and should see healthy growth in the years ahead.  Fiber optic
waveguides, while only a small part of this market segment, should
experience an average annual growth rate of nearly 13% due to a
rapid rise in medical application sales.

Equipment covers power supplies and cooling systems, which should
both see strong gains.  Sales of power supplies will be paced by
demand from carbon dioxide lasers used in material processing.
This application should also generate significant demand for
cooling systems.  Instruments include beam analyzers, detectors,
vibration isolation systems, and positioning equipment.  These
instruments are generally used in research applications, and this
market is not expected to grow rapidly. The average annual growth
rate for this market segment is expected to be 5.8%.  The lone
bright spot in this area is beam analyzers, which are expected to
see much greater use in the fast growing diode market.

Diode laser components include diode laser drivers and diode laser
optics.  Sales in both of these areas should continue to be robust
since the use of diode lasers is expanding rapidly in may
applications.  The new study, Growing Markets For Laser Materials
And Components, is available from BCC for $2750.

Diffuser/Condenser
Improves Process

In an effort to overcome undesirable variations in brightness and
light uniformity, Kulicke & Soffa Industries, Inc. (K&S2101 Blair
Mill Rd., Willow Grove, PA 19090-1795; Tel: 215/784-6000, Fax:
215/659-7588), a producer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment,
has incorporated a holographic diffuser/condenser lens assembly
from Physical Optics Corp. (POC, 20600 Gramercy Place, Building
100, Torrance, CA 90501; Tel: 310/320-3088, Fax: 310/320-8067) in
the machine vision system of its model 1488 turbo wire bonder.  The
wire bonder relies on ultrasonic technology to bond gold or
aluminum wire to a silicon chip, or die, preparing it for
installation into a printed circuit board.

The new lens assembly helps the wire bonder's machine vision system
locate reference points on the die during the semiconductor
manufacturing process.  Prior to adopting this new optical
component, K&S manually glass bead blasted and lacquered a diffuser
surface to one side of an off-the-shelf condenser lens, a time
consuming and unpredictable technique that, combined with the
inherent problems of the light emitting diode (LED) light sources,
often diminished the performance of the machine.

The new optics assembly in the computerized K&S wire bonder
integrates two complex optical elements, a POC holographic
trademarked Light-Shaping Diffuser (LSD) epoxy replicated to the
plano side of a standard glass condenser lens.  Epoxy replication
is a precision process used in the fabrication of high performance
optics, from optical flats to diffraction gratings.  LSDs are
surface relief holographic elements that shape light by precisely
controlling the energy distribution along the horizontal and
vertical axes, allowing engineers to match the light source with
the area requiring illumination.

The LSDs--which can be mass produced using a variety of surface
relief manufacturing processes, including injection molding--
homogenize and shape the LED light before feeding it through the
focusing condenser lens, allowing the wire bonder's pattern
recognition system to easily locate reference points on the die
pad.  The diffuser/lens component works with fewer surfaces, is
prealigned, and possesses the ability to perform tasks that are
either difficult, impossible or very expensive to do separately,
says POC.

The lens assembly takes advantage of the uniform light distribution
and high diffusion rate of LSDs to overcome some of the problems
common among LED light sources, including variations in brightness,
structure, light distribution and alignment.  By doing this, it
enables the wire bonder to attach the tiny wires--typically about
0.001 inch in diameter--with more precision and accuracy than was
possible with the manually applied diffuser surface.

POC manufactures holographic optical elements used in machine
vision, LCD backlights, inspection lighting, and auto displays.
The company works closely with product designers to pursue new
industrial, military, and commercial applications for its
technologies.  Rick Shie is the POC contact.

Possible Reduction
of Passive Losses

A new laser crystal, chromium:lithium strontium gallium fluoride
(Cr3+:LiSrGaF6) is under evaluation by scientists at Lightning
Optical Corp. (431 E. Spruce St., Tarpon Springs, FL 34689-4015;
Tel: 813/938-0092).  Potentially superior to chromium:lithium
strontium aluminum fluoride (Cr3+:LiSrAlF6), the new crystal is
being considered for use in tunable laser systems which can operate
in the 250-400 nanometer (nm) range, reports Arlete Cassanho.

Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 is presently the only crystal that can challenge
titanium:sapphire as a broadly tunable, near infrared (NIR) laser
source.  The Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 materials and their isomorphs have an
advantage for use in rugged, compact, solid state lasers because
they can be efficiently pumped by diode lasers.  So far, though, it
is not clear that the Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 is the best choice.  Negligible
passive loss, coupled with its potentially superior
thermomechanical and thermooptical properties make Cr3+:LiSrGaF6
worthy of consideration.

Initially, Lightning Optical will work with previously grown
samples of Cr3+:LiSrGaF6 to characterize its benefits.  The crystal
can be grown with practically zero passive loss, and in a large
boule size when the company's proprietary synthesis process is
used.  The same synthesis will be used for Cr3+:LiSrAlF6 to reduce
its passive losses to the same level as that measured in the
Cr3+:LiSrGaF6 crystals.

The project also calls for the development of other critical
components, antireflection coatings, capable of withstanding the
rigorous temperature cycling required for the tunability and
frequency conversion, while maintaining a high damage threshold.

NIST Finds That
Disorder Is Useful

Scientists using x-ray diffraction crystallography know that few
crystals have ideal diffraction patterns. Most materials exhibit
diffuse scattering caused by a number of factors grouped under the
name "disorder."  These disorders result in a variety of physical
properties useful in optoelectronics, semiconductors, and high
temperature superconductors.

A new paper from the Thermophysics Div. of the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) Chemical Science and Technology
Laboratory, in collaboration with the Australian National
University, presents a broad overview of the many areas where
diffuse x-ray scattering has been important in understanding the
structure and function of crystalline materials.

Topics covered include alloy systems, simple inorganic systems such
as mixed oxides or halides, low-dimensional conductors, inclusion
compounds, molecular crystals, macromolecular crystals, and quasi-
crystals.  To obtain a free copy of Report 5-95, Diffuse X-Ray
Scattering From Disordered Crystals, contact Sarabeth Moynihan

Low Temperature
Growth Method

A chemist at Washington University in St. Louis (St. Louis, MO
63130) has discovered a new method to grow semiconductor crystals
at temperatures far lower than ever reported.  The method is the
first to use solution phase chemistry to grow the micrometer-sized
crystals at low temperature.  The semiconductors made by the new
method may be used in devices such as light emitting diode (LED)
displays, laser pointers, grocery scanners, compact disc players
and computer components.  The breakthrough offers intriguing
possibilities of developing integrated devices consisting of
semiconductors and polymers, plastics or composites.

Present ways of growing semiconductor crystals prohibit combining
other materials with the semiconductors because of the very high
temperatures required to grow the crystals.  Crystals are currently
produced at temperatures of 500-1,200(C, but the method William E.
Buhro (Tel: 314/935-4269, email: buhro@wuchem.wustl.edu), associate
professor of chemistry at Washington University in St. Louis, has
discovered allows growth at 200(C.  Buhro's technique, the
solution-liquid-solid (SLS) growth method, is similar to the vapor-
liquid-solid (VLS) gas phase growth method which has been used for
some 30 years.

Buhro and other materials chemists had been stymied by the
nonmolecular structures of the semiconductor materials, which do
not allow crystal growth from conventional solvents at low
temperatures.  Buhro made a solution suspension of indium and
indium-gallium nano-sized metal droplets.  The droplets are the
sites from which the semiconductor crystal compounds indium
phosphide, gallium arsenide and indium arsenide (type III-V
semiconductors) nucleate and grow.

Buhro explains, "We refer to this as the solution-liquid-solid
mechanism, a three phase system where the chemistry occurs in
solution, then elements of the semiconductors are deposited into
the liquid--the molten metal droplets--and the product crystallizes
out as a solid."  An important goal in materials chemistry is to
turn down the heat on solid state synthesis.  This new method
expands the range of possibility for these semiconductors.

Building a New Flat
Panel Video Screen

A researcher at the Dept. of Energy (DOE) Brookhaven National Lab
(Box 5000, Upton, NY 11973-5000) has invented a flat panel video
screen that uses lasers as a light source.  Uses of the device may
include video advertising displays, television, computers,
automotive dashboard and aircraft cockpit displays, as well as
portable military maps and wall-sized displays for home
entertainment.  Since the Brookhaven device has advantages in
brightness, contrast, and viewing angle over the new generation of
liquid crystal cockpit displays, the U.S. Air Force is funding
development of the flat panel device for use in its new planes.

In another project involving the new technology funded by the Dept.
of Defense (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA),
Brookhaven also is working on a 5 ft. plastic television screen for
military use.

The Clinton Administration has identified developing flat panel
displays as vital to the economic future of the U.S.  Brookhaven
engineer James Veligdan (Tel: 516/282-5400) invented the device and
developed the display screen prototype, which is 9 in. wide by 5
in. high and approximately 1 in. thick.  The new flat panel screen
has several advantages over current technologies.

Many video display systems now on the market use cathode ray tubes
(CRTs).  Although reliable, they are very large, heavy, and not
easily transportable.  Other than CRTs, the major current video
display technology is limited to liquid crystal displays (LCDs),
which are comparatively difficult and expensive to manufacture.

The Brookhaven technology works by directing light from a miniature
laser to a scanner, which guides the light beam into the proper
sector of laminated wave guides.  Composed of multiple sheets of
laminated borosilicate glass or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
plastic, the waveguides direct the light to the screen to display
the video image.

"The system is totally eye safe, high-contrast, and offers
exceptionally wide viewing angles.  Also, the screen can be used in
cold weather, whereas liquid crystals thicken and freeze as
temperatures dip below freezing.  The technology can be adapted to
display 3D images if the viewer wears polarized glasses.
Maintenance is easy and inexpensive," says Veligdan.

520/746-1234, Fax: 520/294-3300, email: opc_info@ix.netcom.com), a
manufacturer of high power diode lasers, diode laser subsystems and
modules, fiber-coupled diode laser arrays, and related accessories,
has introduced a line of optical reimaging units (ORUs) designed to
focus light from its high power, fiber-coupled diode lasers and OEM
modules into smaller or larger spot sizes.  Developed primarily for
industrial users such as laser marking, soldering, heat treating,
and materials processing, these (ORUs) reduce or enlarge diode
laser spot sizes by as much as three fold, depending on the model,
reports OPC's Merrill Apter.

The ORUs focus the laser light into free space and are available
with working distances of 20-68 millimeters (mm).  Equipped with
antireflective coated lenses that transmit up to 97% of the laser
light to the target, OPC's ORUs also help protect the diode lasers'
fiber bundles from harsh environments.  All ORUs are housed in
rugged cylindrical aluminum enclosures 37 mm in diameter and have
thread patterns standard in the industry.

Advances in
Quantum Wire

Advances in the production of quantum wires is reported by a
research group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
(Urbana, IL 61081).  The team, headed by Keh-Yung Cheng (Tel:
217/333-6642, Fax: 217/244-6375, email: kcheng@uxl.cso.uiuc.edu),
have used molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and strain induced lateral
layering ordering (SILO) techniques to build quantum wires,
nanoscale atomic structures believed to dramatically increase the
efficiency and reliability of light emitting devices such as laser
diodes.

Many of the advances in computing, data storage and
telecommunications have come as a result of the evolution of
semiconductor materials.  While silicon has been utilized to
stretch the bounds of computer processing power and speed, other
semiconductors have been applied to create photonic devices.  Such
devices can emit or detect light; for example, semiconductor laser
diodes can be used to read data from compact disks.

Over the past 30 years, the techniques for creating these
semiconductors have been refined.  Using a MBE method, scientists
can grow semiconductors in layers as thin as one atom.  By
selecting the types of semiconductor material, properties such as
the color of its light emissions can be engineered.

An ultrathin layer, or quantum well, has done much to improve the
reliability and efficiency of light emitting devices.  This quantum
well is the center of a semiconductor sandwich that is only a few
dozen atoms thick.  When structures approach this nanoscale,
electrons begin to change their characteristics and exhibit quantum
size effects.  Such changes can affect and improve the overall
performance of optical devices, such as achieving more light
generation for a laser diode.

The next step in quantum devices are structures that utilize
quantum wires.  Similar to quantum wells, quantum wires have atomic
scale thickness in two dimensions instead of one.  With this
additional degree of quantum confinement, it is theorized that even
higher levels of efficiency and reliability can be observed in
practical optical devices.

The color of a standard laser diode's output light can vary with
time and temperature.  Quantum wire lasers, though, are thought to
maintain uniform characteristics over a broader range of
environmental variables.  Until now, very little success has been
achieved in preparing such quantum wire structures.

In the Illinois work, the SILO process used MBE to grow
alternating, ultrathin layers, less than two atoms thick, inside
semiconductor structures.  The number of atoms in each layer is
slightly different, either lesser or greater, than would normally
be required.  The resulting atomic imbalance creates a strain force
inside the growing crystal.  The strain force, in turn, causes
certain atoms to group together along lines on the growing surface.
When the SILO process is combined with quantum well fabrication
techniques in MBE quantum wire regions are formed almost
automatically.

Cheng's group has demonstrated laser devices emitting in the
visible and infrared (IR) spectra range using quantum wires.  The
devices, showed various new and unexpected optical characteristics,
are the subject of further research at the university.  Eventual
end uses may include improved supermarket checkout scanners and
home fiber optic communications.

Miniature NIR
Spectrometer

Ocean Optics, Inc. (OOI, 1237 Lady Marion Lane, Dunedin, FL 34698-
5314; Tel: 813/733-2447, Fax: 813/733-3962, email:
75461.2007@compuserve.com) has introduced its PbS-256 miniature
fiber optic near infrared (NIR) spectrometer system designed to
record spectral data from 1-3 microns at 256 wavelengths
simultaneously.  Engineered to meet the needs of the broad-based
NIR spectroscopy marketplace, including applications in
telecommunications, biomedicine, chemistry, microelectronics and
environmental monitoring, the new PbS-256 complements OOI's
existing family of small ultraviolet (UV) and visible (VIS) fiber
optic spectrometers.

The PbS-256 features a 256-element lead sulfide linear charge
coupled device (CCD) focal plane array with an on-board
multiplexer.  User adjustable integration times of 1.0 microsecond
to about 100 milliseconds provide essential dynamic range and
sensitivity for measurements at low and high light levels.  The
dynamic range of the new NIR spectrometer is further enhanced,
reports OOI's Rob Morris, by detector-based dark current
subtractors that utilize global and individual pixel adjustments
via digital to analog converters (DACs).  This minimizes unwanted
current that flows in a detector's pixels when no photons are
hitting the detector.

The PbS-256, like Ocean Optics' other miniature spectrometers,
employs special optics designed for use with single strand optical
fibers.  The light from the fiber is dispersed by a fixed grating
across the detector.  Spectra are captured in milliseconds and
brought into a Microsoft Windows-based data acquisition and
processing software program that allows the user to set and control
a host of functions, including sensor integration time, auto dark
current correction, signal averaging and optical measurement
technique.  The system's operating software provides users with the
ability to view full spectra in real time as voltage or as percent
transmission or absorbance, and to store them as ASCII files.

At $15,000 per unit, the PbS-256 is believed to offer NIR spectral
coverage for a fraction of the cost of scanning devices such as
fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectrometers.  The system has no
moving parts and is dramatically smaller, more durable and easier
to transport for field work than bulky mechanical scanning systems.
OOI also offers a line of optional fiber optic light sources,
probes and sensors compatible with the PbS-256.

Established in 1992, OOI manufactures low cost, miniature fiber
optic spectrometers, probes, light sources and accessories for
industrial process control, environmental monitoring, and medical
and research applications.  The company's line of UV, VIS and NIR
spectrometers includes PC plug-in, benchtop and notebook platforms,
available in 12 different diffraction gratings and 5 standard input
fibers for configurement to a wide range of application needs.  All
OOI spectrometers can be optimized to measure spectral
characteristics such as absorbance, transmission, reflection,
irradiance and fluorescence.

Chemical Monitor
under Construction

Engineers at Inrad, Inc. (181 Legrand Ave., Northvale, NJ 07647-
2498; Tel: 201/767-1910 are building a mid infrared (IR) laser for
the remote sensing of chemicals.  Sergei Govorkov reports that many
environmentally sensitive chemicals, including chemical warfare
agents, have signature absorption lines in the mid IR spectral
region.  A differential absorption light (DIAL) detection and
ranging system, if it were continuously tunable in the fingerprint
IR wavelength region, would serve as the basis for an accurate,
real time chemical monitor for a wide range of gases.

The Inrad project will involve the construction of a solid state
optical parametric oscillator (OPO)-based transmitter for a DIAL
system.  The engineers will design and build a zinc germanium
phosphide-based OPO pumped by a Q-switched, flashlamp pumped,
erbium-doped yttrium scandium gadolinium garnet laser.  The
performance of the system will be evaluated with respect to
conversion efficiency, tuning range and emission linewidth.  Based
on the results, a conceptual design for an OPO-based DIAL system
will be developed.

The successful completion of the Inrad project could lead to the
remote sensing of stack gases, greenhouse gases, chemical warfare
agents and precursors for chemical used in the manufacture of
illegal drugs.  The technology may have some defense applications
in target designation and countermeasures.

Reflectance Control
Method Discovered

An optical recording media which permits manufacturers to more
accurately control light reflectance has been constructed by
researchers at Pioneer Electronic Corp. (1-4-1 Meguro, Meguro-Ku,
Tokyo 153, Japan; Tel: 3 3494111, Fax: 3 34954428).  Fumio Matsui
reports that the new medium includes a transparent substrate, a
metal phthalocyanine-based optical recording film, a metal
reflective film, and a protective layer.

Optical recording media normally have advantages over competitive
materials in memory capacity with respect to write-in or read-out
operations. Operations do not involve contact of components.  There
is a trend to standardize such media, e.g., optical disks, with
respect to optical and mechanical characteristics.

The reflectance or reflectance ratio, one of the optical
characteristics of a recording film, must be 10-90% before
recording and 27-90% after recording, and the uniformity of
reflectance must be less than 12%.  Conventional techniques for
controlling this reflectance call for either mixing different kinds
of materials or producing films with variable thicknesses.

There are several problems with existing techniques.  First, when
different materials are mixed, some internal reactions may occur.
In such cases, it is extremely difficult to control the resulting
reflectance.  Second, it is difficult to manufacture films with
uniform thicknesses.  This also makes control of reflectance
difficult.

The Pioneer Electronic scientists built an optical recording medium
that includes a transparent light transmission substrate of
polycarbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or amorphous
polyolefin (APO) resin.  The substrate, formed by a
photopolymerization technique, has a thickness of 1.0-1.5
millimeters (mm).  A recording film is formed on the substrate by
heating a metal phthalocyanine and circulating it in toluene for
12-24 hrs.  The aggregated portion, obtained by removing the
toluene, is then dissolved in tetrafluoropropanol.

The solvent fractions containing the aggregated and nonaggregated
fractions were applied to the substrate using a spin coating
technique at a thickness of about 130 mm.  A gold, aluminum, silver
or copper reflective film is then formed by vacuum evaporation,
sputtering, or ion plating techniques.  An epoxy, acrylic,
silicone, or urethane resin is then used to provide a protective
layer on the reflective film.  The improved control of the medium's
reflectance stems from the ability to mix the aggregated and
nonaggregated portions of the solvent in precise ratios.  U.S.
Patent 5,439,778 covers details of the Pioneer Electronic
invention.

Improved Near
Infrared Absorbers

Phthalocyanine-based near infrared (NIR) absorbers formulated by
scientists at Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc. (3-2-5 Kasumigaseki,
Chiyoda-Ku, Tokyo, Japan; Tel: 3/5937111, Fax: 3/5924267) are
intended for use in optical recording media, NIR absorption
filters, and liquid crystal display devices.  Hisato Itoh reports
that the advantages of the new absorbers include light, weather and
thermal resistance, as well as high molar extinction coefficients.

NIR absorbers play an important role in optoelectronic applications
such as information recording media, display media, sensors, and
goggles.  Conventional absorbers, based on cyanine, anthraquinone
or naphthoquinone dyes or dithiol complexes, suffer from several
disadvantages.  Cyanine dyes do not have sufficient light and
thermal resistance.  The absorption wavelength of phthalocyanine
dyes is 600-700 nanometers (nm), extremely short.  Anthraquinone
and naphthoquinone dyes have low molar extinction coefficients.
Dithiol complexes are not thermally stable, and they also have low
molar extinction coefficients.

The Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals formulation is based on phthalocyanine
derivatives in which each of the 4 benzene rings contained in the
molecule have 1-4 substituent groups.  The intermediates are
reacted with a metal halide, acetate, or sulfate by heating in a
solvent such as urea.  The absorber is coated onto a transparent
substrate using a spin coating process.  The Mitsui Toatsu
Chemicals discovery is covered in U.S. Patent 5,446,141.

New FOTP
Standards

The Telecommunications Industry Assn. (TIA, 2500 Wilson Blvd.,
Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22201; Tel: 703/907-7700, Fax: 703/907-
7727) has published the American National Standard Interconnection
Device Insertion Loss Test, or TIA/EIA-455-34A.  Originally
published as EIA-455-34, the revised standard defines the procedure
by which the optical insertion of a complete fiber optic
interconnection can be measured.  This fiber optic test procedure
(FOTP) was formulated under the guidance of TIA's engineering
subcommittee on fiber optic connection devices.

TIA has also published American National Standard Measurement of
Fiber Strain in Cables Under Tensile Load, or TIA/EIA-455-38.  This
FOTP is intended to provide an accurate method for measuring
changes in the average longitudinal strain on a cabled optical
fiber.  The document, which outlines a method for measuring changes
in strain from one loading condition to another, was formulated
under the guidance of TIA's subcommittee on fiber optic cables.
Sharon Grace is the TIA contact.

BOOKS

Every Aspect
of VCSELs

Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers, by Terence Edward Sale of
the U.K.-based University of Sheffield, covers the principles,
theory, design and operation of vertical cavity surface emitting
lasers (VCSELs).  Semiconductor lasers have advanced a long way
since their first demonstration in the early 1960s and have a large
impact on many devices today.

They act as sources for optical fiber systems and permit the
reading of data from compact discs and barcode labels.  VCSELs have
many advantages over conventional semiconductor lasers.  The most
obvious is the possibility of very large arrays and a narrow
circular output beam, which can be efficiently coupled into the
core of a fiber.  As a result, the author believes that the time
for a book devoted to VCSELs has come.

The first chapter of the volume describes the history and prospects
of VCSELs and the choice of material systems for emission in
different wavelengths.  The second chapter concerns the optical
properties of short vertical cavities, and the quantum mechanical
processes facilitating optical gain and spontaneous emission
processes are the focus of the third chapter.  Concepts are
developed from basic principles, and the effect of strain on the
optical processes in quantum wells is also covered.  Readers are
introduced to techniques for epitaxial crystal growth and the
fabrication of VCSEL devices in Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 explores
the resistance problems that can arise due to the many
heterojunctions in dielectric reflector stacks.

Chapters 6 and 7 are case studies which describe measurements made
on 2 VCSEL structures, one grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
and the other by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
In Chapter 8, experimental data from these case studies are
analyzed using models, and the final chapter describes other
aspects of VCSELs such as modulation response, arrays and noise
performance.

The book does a good job of covering the VCSEL field and should be
of value to those experienced in the optics field, as well as to
novices and students.  Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers is
published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (605 Third Ave., New York, NY
10158; Tel: 212/850-6336). 1995.  Price: $89.95
