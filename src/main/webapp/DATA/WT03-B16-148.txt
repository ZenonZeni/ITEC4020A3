<img src="../caps/icap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="I">t is considered one of Vietnam's blue-chip companies and one whose clout is difficult to rival. Its success has inspired the admiration and jealousy of foreign developers and local competitors alike. And in a sense, SaigonTourist was born to be envied. Founded in 1975 by the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee, SaigonTourist's mandate has been to manage the most valuable real estate in Vietnam's wealthiest city.<p>

<img src="../february97/profile/pic1.jpg" valign=top align=right alt="Tourists on Bus Photo">

Sitting atop rights to HCMC's premier properties in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the height of Vietnam's land rush, SaigonTourist solidified its stature as one of the country's elite companies. As the operator of more than 55 hotels -- including HCMC's most historic hotels like the Continental, the Rex, the Caravelle and the Majestic -- SaigonTourist's annual turnover last year topped more than $100 million. As a result of their sprawling size, some have branded them "monopolists," "intimidating," and "big-mouth tycoons." In the past, SaigonTourist officials might have laughed off such descriptions. Today, without the general director who oversaw the company's tremendous growth since 1986 and with the outlook for hotel businesses in HCMC growing dimmer, those officials may not be so sanguine.<p>

A Model State Company

<img src="../caps/mcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="M">any credit SaigonTourist's charismatic general director, Mr. Duong Van Day, who died at age 53 of a heart attack last summer, for much of the company's success <a href="../february97/comprofilerel.html">(see related story)</a>. Under his leadership SaigonTourist made use of its privileged beginnings, forming the city's most prestigious hotel JVs like the New World Saigon and the Floating Hotel.<p>

While he was surely dealt a good hand, Day faced the task of managing a massive state-enterprise without any experience running a hotel business, nor any business for that matter. A longtime HCMC-based accountant credits Day for his accomplishments. "Although the business wasn't perfectly managed, it wasn't bad given its size and Day's background. It's not easy in the climate of moving from a state-controlled to market economy."<p>

Using SaigonTourist's land holdings as a base, Day expanded beyond the tourism sector to broaden the company's holdings into areas such as office buildings, business centers, and telecommunications. SaigonTourist also owns auto showrooms and is the local distributor for Ford Motor Co. <p>

Being the leading provider of guest rooms in HCMC, SaigonTourist spun off a cable TV company to beam foreign programming into those rooms. SCTV is now the only authorized retailer of satellite dishes in HCMC.<p>

As investment dollars rolled into HCMC's property and hotel sector, SaigonTourist's asset base and notoriety steadily grew. Local accountants, lawyers, hotel managers, and property consultants who spoke on condition of anonymity, say that SaigonTourist used its leverage to drive extremely tough deals with JV partners, and did whatever it took to keep competition to a minimum. It was a company that people learned to step lightly around.<p>

But like many companies led by personable leaders, the question now is whether SaigonTourist can continue its phenomenal growth in the post-Day era -- an era of more competition and oversupply in the tourism and property markets in HCMC.<p>

An Empire Meets the Market
</font><p>


<img src="../caps/acap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="A">s the property market evolved, SaigonTourist lost some of its luster. Hundreds of new hotel rooms became available in HCMC in 1996, and many of them remained empty. Last year was not kind to any of the hotels operating in HCMC, and SaigonTourist¹s "grande dame" hotels were not spared.<p>

"It's now in a transitional period," says one HCMC-based lawyer familiar with SaigonTourist. "This year it's waking up to the reality that there's a slowdown in tourism. There's more competition, and it's starting to feel the heat."<p>

According to SaigonTourist, occupancy rates at SaigonTourist's premier hotels were 68 percent in 1995. Last year, it fell to 50 percent. Moreover, for the first time in its history, SaigonTourist does not own at least 50 percent of HCMC's international-standard hotel rooms. Says a director at SaigonTourist, summing up the company's changed position: "Five years ago, we could decide on the prices ourselves. Now our prices depend on the market. We are not a big company that can control our competitors like before."<p>

Critics argue that more fundamental problems exist. They charge that SaigonTourist has been loathe to form JVs with foreign hotels and as a result, has missed opportunities to improve standards and to tap into international registration networks. "It forgets it's a monopoly," says one industry source. "It may be more business-oriented than other state companies, but compared to international standards it¹s not a success yet. Especially in view of all the assets and political support available to it."<p>

Day was renowned for resisting foreign suitors. In the early 1990s developers were throwing proposal after proposal at Day, trying to set up joint ventures for SaigonTourist's prestigious District 1 properties. Few found success. The company's monopoly, and perhaps its hubris, were at their zenith and Day was adamant about keeping HCMC's most treasured properties solely in the hands of the State. The outcome, some hotel managers say, is that hotels which could have been turned into profitable classics like the Metropole in Hanoi, have poor standards and dwindling occupancy rates. "Like any big group, it feels it can do anything," explains one hotel GM. "It was so proud it spent only $5 million to renovate the Majestic Hotel itself, but this was a mistake. It should have spent three times that much and then charged higher room rates."<p>

A Successor is Chosen
</font><p>

<img src="../caps/fcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="F">iguring out how to improve service and accommodations, how to tap international customer networks and how to respond to the vagaries of the market are now the challenges for Do Van Hoang, who on October 1st was chosen to fill Day's shoes as general director of SaigonTourist.<p>

Business associates and industry sources believe the HCMC People's Committee has found the right man in Hoang to succeed Day. Like Day, Hoang is a former District 1 People's Committee chairman with impeccable political credentials. "He has a lot of friends in HCMC," says one tour company director. "Government leaders understand him."<p>

Unlike Duong Van Day, however, Hoang is entering as general director with six years experience working in the property business. He was general director at Sunimex Company, a huge property and trading company operated by the District 1 People's Committee. At Sunimex, Hoang clinched major JV projects, such as the successful Liang Court -- Regency residential property which opened recently, as well as the Ramada-New World hotel JV that is under construction along the Saigon River.<p>

Mr. Thang Hoang Nguyen, an Australian-Vietnamese, says Hoang was the first businessman he met when he returned to Vietnam six years ago. Together, they formed the first hotel JV in HCMC -- the Norfolk Hotel near Ben Thanh Market.<p>

"He knows who to contact and how much a project's going to cost you," Nguyen says. "I know this guy. I think he can restructure SaigonTourist. If you work for him, you must prove your skills. If you don't, he'll replace you. He can be a tough man about this kind of business." Nguyen says the Norfolk venture worked because in 1990, Hoang realized he still had much to learn about the business. He was willing to cede management control to the Norfolk Group. "He said, 'Hey, Hoang, you brought the money in, you brought the experience in, so you have to take care of the business.'"<p>

New Directions
</font><p>

<img src="../caps/rcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="R">eassessing SaigonTourist's finances and finding the capital he needs to complete projects, will not be the least of Hoang's challenges. Some industry sources say Hoang may refocus Saigon Tourist on its core properties in HCMC. At the same time, however, the company is moving forward with a plan to build villas at Halong Bay. Financing for the project may come partly from a share offering open to domestic and foreign buyers, SaigonTourist officials say.<p>

Hoang will also oversee the $210 million Asiana Plaza development on Le Duan St. and the $80 million Hilton/FEAL hotel under construction.<p>

Amidst these capital needs are lingering questions about the state of SaigonTourist's books. Nobody is really sure what the cash flow is like, nor whether the company is making any profit. SaigonTourist officials estimate 1995 profits were $3.4 million, and $3.5 million in 1996. "It's hard to say. They're managing to generate income, pay salaries, and pay taxes but beyond that who knows?," says the HCMC accountant.<p>

Having the answers to these questions at his fingertips may be important if Hoang decides to pursue a proposal that Day rejected several years ago. Then, representatives from Standard Chartered bank proposed an offshore equity listing in Hong Kong or Singapore. It was an ambitious, "long shot" proposal, and one which would have required an independent audit and substantial political backing. The timing was not right and the deal did not materialize. 
With Hoang in his new position, however, he may have to go through an exhaustive assessment of SaigonTourist's finances anyway. The market is different, as are SaigonTourist's capital needs. Hoang can expect offshore bankers to start calling, and this time, SaigonTourist may be listening.<p>

To JV partners and observers who have seen him at his new position, Hoang has exhibited business savvy and market-oriented thinking still uncommon among state-company heads. Hoang will need all the business acumen and connections he can muster. He faces a double whammy of sorts: new challenges and Day's memory, which will remain in the halls of SaigonTourist's offices for a long time.<p>

In charge of so many properties at the beginning of doi moi, Day is a legend who may simply have been in the right place at the right time. His greatest strength was an ability to steer the organization in the right direction when state-owned companies were learning how to adapt to the fluidity of the market on the fly. SaigonTourist's fate ultimately rests on Hoang's ability to do the same.<p>
