<P>
The CRC for the Cattle and Beef Industry was established in 1993 to improve the quality and consistency of Australian beef to match the exacting requirements of new customers in Asia and to better cater for Australian diets. The CRC is also addressing constraints to the beef industry arising from community concerns about animal health and welfare and waste management.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Three research programs cover the main influences on meat quality:
<UL>
<LI>molecular and quantitative genetics;
<LI>meat science; and
<LI>growth and nutrition.
</UL>
A fourth sub-program covers major constraints to the industry: animal health and welfare, feedlot waste management and industry econo
mics.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
A range of products with major benefits for the industry include:
<UL>
<LI>tools for predicting meat quality on live animals;
<LI>better quality carcasses at lower cost from improved breeding techniques;
<LI>breeding stock with improved feed-conversion efficiency;
<LI>techniques to eliminate pre-slaughter stress effects on meat colour and tenderness;
<LI>strategies to manage young cattle to improve finishing on grass and grain; and
<LI>vaccines to eliminate feedlot-specific diseases.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
With annual earnings of $3.7 billion and exports of $2.6 billion, the beef industry is vital to Australia's economy. New markets in Asia offer potential for further growth, but the market share will depend on the ability to match specification to consumer requirements. In Japan alone, the opportunity to improve carcass grades of Australian beef will earn $200 million more a year.
The CRC's objectives are to assist the beef industry become more profitable and anticipate and adapt to changing value-based markets.
 Activities are closely aligned with industry needs through the involvement of an industry-driven Board and the participation of co-operating breeding herds from the seedstock industry.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
The CRC's health and welfare program is located at the CSIRO's laboratory in Parkville. At this site, scientists are developing new vaccines against cattle respiratory disease, a major cause of sickness and death among feedlot cattle in Australia. The group should have a vaccine ready for commercialisation by mid-1996.
