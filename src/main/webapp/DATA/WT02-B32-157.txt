<P>The WindStar Project is an Earth Observations Commercial Applications
Program of User Systems, Incorporated  with joint funding from NASA's Commercial
Remote Sensing Program Office, John C. Stennis Space Center.    The objective of
the WindStar Project is to establish the commercial viability of using
twice-a-day satellite scatterometer data to produce marine wind observation and
forecast products for commercial television weather broadcasts.  Using
information from NASA's &quot;NSCAT&quot; scatterometer on board the Japanese
ADEOS satellite, User Systems is developing &quot;broadcast ready&quot; weather
animations showing current and forecasted wind speed  and direction.  Special
coverage of hurricanes and extra-tropical cyclones at sea will also be provided.
 Another product being developed as part of the project is the display of ocean
waves and storm surge associated with severe weather events.  User Systems also
is developing the distribution system to deliver these products to television
stations in time for local television newscasts.  </P>
<P>NSCAT is a microwave (14 GHZ radar) scatterometer instrument with six
dual-polarized antennas for collection of backscatter data with a resolution of
25 km.  Scatterometers use a highly indirect technique to measure wind velocity
over the ocean.  A scatterometer transmits microwave pulses and receives
backscattered power from the ocean surface.  Changes in wind velocity cause
changes in ocean surface roughness, which modify the radar cross section of the
ocean and the magnitude of the backscattered radar power.  By measuring the
backscattered power from various aspect angles, these measurements can be used
to derive wind speed and direction.   The information derived from NSCAT is
critical in determining regional weather patterns and global climate.  The
instrument is capable of measuring winds in all weather and cloud conditions.</P>
<P>Several coastal television stations are participating in the WindStar
Project: WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, WCPX in Orlando, Florida, WWL in New
Orleans, Louisiana, and WRC in Washington, D.C.</P>
