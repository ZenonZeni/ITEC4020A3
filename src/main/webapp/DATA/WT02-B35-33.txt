TESTS CONFIRM SAGA HAS MAJOR GAS FIND IN 6406/2

Saga Petroleum, operator of last year's most significant Norwegian
discovery - 6406/2-1, southwest of Smoerbukk - is believed to be taking
a more sober view of likely recoverable reserves after an extensive
test programme confirmed reservoir variability.  According to the NPD,
a seven-DST test programme proved that reservoir quality varies greatly
over the thick gross pay section with some zones very dense while
others exhibit good production qualities.

Nevertheless, preliminary estimates confirm the find to be of major
importance containing recoverable reserves in the order of 50-100 MMcm
of oil equivalents, reports the NPD.  Informed sources suggest this
range is too conservative and 100 MMcm may be a more realistic
estimate.  Most of the reserves are in the form of gas, but large
quantities of condensate are also present.  The results of the well
currently being drilled into the southern part of the structure -
6406/2-2 - will allow the find's size to be estimated with more
certainty, according to the NPD.

The test programme is said to have yielded maximum gas flowrates of
27.534 MMcfd and 1,572 b/d of condensate through a 28.58-millimetre
choke.  It is believed the water contact proved to be higher than first
thought and the Tilje formation was a disappointment.  As expected
before testing the Ile proved to be the best zone and contains the
majority of the reserves.

Exploration well 6406/2-1 first discovered gas last Spring, but was
suspended short of TD in March due to fisheries and environmental
restrictions (NSL 1000/13).  The well was re-entered late in August
with the semisub Ross Isle and deepened to a TD of 5,766 metres, making
it the deepest exploration well ever drilled on the Norwegian Shelf.
More core material was recovered than on any other Norwegian well -
over 600 metres.  The well was finally suspended on January 7 and the
Ross Isle is preparing to spud Smoerbukk prospect appraisal well
6506/11-4S for Statoil.

AKER, ABB AND MARITIME TENTECH WIN MAJOR AASGARD SHIP CONTRACT

A consortium comprising Aker, ABB and Maritime Tentech has won the
prestigious contract to build the world's largest monohull production
vessel for Statoil's Aasgard oilfield development.  The contractors
will form an alliance with Statoil to implement the project, sharing
profits above a target price for the facilities as well as the risk of
cost overruns.  Maritime Tentech has been given responsibility for
delivering the hull, which will be built by Hitachi in Japan.  This
contract is valued at Kr 1.52bn ($239m).  Aker Engineering and ABB will
have responsibility for engineering and purchase of the plant to be
installed on the deck of the vessel, a contract which amounts to around
Kr 140m.  Aker Stord will assemble and hook-up the vessel - work valued
at Kr 300m.

The contracts with ABB, Aker and Tentech, which are subject to
government approval of the field development plan, include options of
around Kr 450m for further fabrication and marine installation.  The
vessel's deck plant, due to be purchased this Spring, is not included
in the contracts awarded to date.

The oil production vessel for Aasgard is due for delivery from Stord at
end-May 1998 for first oil in August 1998.  The ship will have a
production capacity of around 200,000 b/d of oil and gas processing
capability of up to 16 MMcmd.  Storage will be provided for 150,000 cm
of oil.  The vessel will measure 276 metres long by 45.4 metres across
the beam with a draught of 26.6 metres.

Aker also announced the Kr 380m contract for electrical work on the
Aasgard Field had been awarded to Aker Elektro.  The company will
supply systems for the production vessel and the gas platform with the
contract encompassing engineering, follow-up work at the shipyards,
hook-up, testing and commissioning plus an option for operating
maintenance and the supply of spare parts during the operational phase.
 Preparatory work will begin at once and the project is planned to
start in March 1996.  The gas platform is due for completion in October
2000.  Aker Engineering and Cegelec UK will be Aker Elektro's main
subcontractors.

At the same time Aker said Statoil had awarded Aker Engineering a Kr
30m contract to design the production systems for the Aasgard Field gas
platform.  Design work will get under way immediately and continue
until April 1997.  The scope of Aker Engineering's contract may be
expanded, depending on how the project is implemented.  A decision on
whether detailed engineering and construction will be separate
contracts will be made later this year.  If they are, Aker will carry
out detailed engineering.

ESSO CONTRACTS ABB FOR SUBSEA PART OF BALDER

Esso Norway has awarded an ABB/Coflexip Stena partnership a Kr 650-700m
($102.3-110.2m) contract to design, procure and install all the subsea
equipment for the Balder Field development.  ABB will be responsible
for the wellhead equipment and controls, while Coflexip Stena will be
responsible for the risers and flowlines.  The contract was signed just
before Christmas and engineering work has already started.  The initial
phase of the work, comprising 15 wells, is to be completed by 1998,
with equipment for the first well to be delivered by October this year.
 There is an option for a second phase involving an additional 10-12
wells.

*  Amerada Hess is thought to be close to a contract award for the
subsea part of Durward/Dauntless, with Stolt Comex Seaway believed to
be well placed.

MANNESMANN WINS CONTRACT TO SUPPLY BRITANNIA LINEPIPE

Britannia Operator has awarded Mannesmann Handel a contract for the
supply of 185 kms of 27-inch OD linepipe for the export trunkline from
the platform to Mobil's SAGE terminal.  A total of 50,000-55,000 tonnes
will be supplied by Mannesmann's Europipe mill in Mulheim, Germany.
First deliveries to a North Sea coating site will be made in June and
should be completed in mid-August.  The pipe coating contract is due
for award in April.  A pipelay contract was awarded to EMC last Autumn.

BOL said that careful timing of procurement and more functional
specifications had saved several million pounds on the contract.  The
choice of an outer diameter of 27 inches on its own had saved some #2m
($3.1m) compared with opting for the larger standard 28-inch diameter
linepipe.

BARMAC PLANS MAJOR INVESTMENT IN NIGG TO MEET CONSTRUCTION NEEDS

Barmac is planning a multi-million investment programme to upgrade
facilities at its Nigg yard in the north of Scotland.  The initiative
forms part of the company's strategic plan to address the needs of the
changing offshore construction market, which has seen the decline of
traditional fabrication markets due to depressed oil and gas prices,
new technologies and the maturity of the North Sea.  At the same time
this is being offset by a growing requirement for floating production
systems, decommissioning of redundant offshore structures, production
jack-ups, concrete structures and other dry-docking work.  The new
business could become equal in size to the old within the next five
years, it says.

The Ardersier yard will continue to concentrate on servicing the
reduced requirement for traditional structures, while Nigg and its
graving dock will form the focus for the new business areas.  "Although
the traditional market is in decline, we believe it will stabilise at
around 10m manhours a year to the year 2000.  With this volume of work
available and the continuous improvement in competitiveness we can win
enough work to sustain a viable and profitable business concentrated in
the Ardersier facility," says Barmac.

Up to #8m ($12.4m) is being targeted for modifications to the existing
graving dock at Nigg and for the creation of a custom-built
decommissioning facility.  It is expected that the funding will come
from Barmac's parent companies and the public sector.  Barmac aims to
obtain planning permission and a waste disposal licence for the Nigg
site, with a capital investment of around #0.5m envisaged to establish
a custom-built facility capable of the containment and collection of
waste materials for subsequent treatment and disposal.

Other opportunities for business in an upgraded dock include building
large production jack-ups similar to that used by BP for the Harding
Field.  Possible collaboration with civil contractors to build offshore
concrete structures is also being investigated, as are the
possibilities of drydocking large semi-submersible and jack-up rigs for
inspection and modification.  "This potential major infrastructure
investment is a clear indication of the confidence our parent companies
have in our ability to win a significant share of growing new markets,
of our employees' ability to adapt in order to capitalise on these
markets and of our determination to build a sustainable future for the
yards," says Barmac general manager Don Wright.

PHILLIPS TARGETS POSSIBLE JACQUI START-UP AT END-1997

Phillips' Jacqui prospect, in UK block 30/13, could be on stream by the
end of 1997 if reserves are firmed up by two back-to-back appraisal
wells to be drilled by the Galaxy 1, according to quadrant 30
development director Pat Dinan, in a house paper.  The drilling of the
second well is contingent on what is found with the first.  Of the two
wells drilled so far on Jacqui, one indicated a gas condensate
reservoir, while the other produced gas, he said.  A high pressure/high
temperature exploration well is being drilled by the Monitor on the
Jade prospect in block 30/2C.  If it is successful, two appraisal wells
will be drilled on Jade in 1997, with first production planned for late
in 1998.

Trafalgar John Brown and Kvaerner Engineering have recently completed
some conceptual engineering studies for Phillips to help identify the
best way of developing some of the remaining quadrant 30 prospects,
confirming Phillips' view that they would benefit from a shared
development plan.  Added impetus is given by the fact that the
Judy/Joanne processing and transport system is now in place.

STATOIL ENGINEERS SEEK PATENTS FOR VESSEL AND LIFTING SOLUTIONS

Patents are being sought by Brian Stead and Ove Gudmestad of Statoil
for vessel and lifting solutions which are claimed to offer cheaper
removal and transport of topsides and jackets to land.  For the largest
platforms a U-shaped main hull is proposed with a smaller removable
hull inside.  For topsides weighing less than 1,500 tonnes a
submersible barge or ship with eight-metre steel shafts, plus a shear
leg, is proposed.  Stead, in a recent house paper, says dayrates for a
barge/ship and a shear leg would be only 10-15% of the daily cost of
the large semi-submersibles.  For jacket and subsea template removal
the suggestion is a supply vessel with winches or wire jacks attached
to its sides.

BHP ACHIEVES FIRST GAS FROM LIVERPOOL BAY HAMILTON NORTH FIELD

BHP Petroleum achieved first gas from the Liverpool Bay Hamilton North
Field on December 20.  The initial output is being used to commission
systems and pipelines offshore and onshore and subsequently PowerGen's
new power station at Connah's Quay before full contract deliveries
begin in mid-1996 (NSL  1033/5).  Oil from Douglas and Lennox is
expected to flow in the next few weeks marking the start-up of first
oil production off Britain's west coast.  Gas production from the
Hamilton Field is scheduled for early this year and from Lennox in
several years' time.  Recoverable gas reserves from the development are
estimated at 1.2 Tcf.  Peak gas capacity of the offshore development
and Point of Ayr terminal is currently 300 MMcfd.

MAERSK BRINGS ROAR ON STREAM

Maersk Oil and Gas's Roar Field came on stream on January 7, around 10
months ahead of project schedule.  The small field will produce oil and
gas from two horizontal development wells.  Roar has been developed as
an unmanned satellite of the Tyra Field using a slimline STAR design
wellhead platform.  Oil and gas are separated and sent via two
pipelines 11 kms to Tyra East.  Initial production rates were not
available.  Total recoverable gas reserves are estimated at 14 Bcm with
12-18m barrels of liquids.

AMERADA AND DONG ASSESS POTENTIAL OF NEW DANISH GAS SYSTEM

Amerada Hess and DONG have agreed to investigate jointly the technical
and economic feasibility of building a new natural gas transport system
in the Danish sector of the North Sea.  Depending on which technical
solution is the most attractive, the system could require an investment
of some DKr 1.5-2.5bn ($269-449m).  A new transport system would be
able to gather gas from Amerada's South Arne Field, on which a
promising production test was run last year, as well as other smaller
fields and could also be linked to the Norwegian system.  There may be
a further possibility to transport gas to Denmark from the UK, German
and Norwegian sectors.

The existing Danish system has an annual transport capacity of about
7.5 Bcm of gas, which corresponds to the total amount of gas which DUC
(until now DONG's sole supplier) is able to deliver to DONG from 1997.
With these deliveries the existing system will be nearing its capacity.
 From the turn of the century, DONG expects to be able to sell
additional gas in the region of 2 Bcm a year.

STUDY SHOWS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF AASGARD GAS WILL BE LIMITED

The environmental impact of processing gas from the Aasgard Field will
be limited regardless of whether it takes place at Kaarstoe, north of
Stavanger, or Kollsnes, near Bergen.  This is the conclusion of the
impact assessment submitted by Statoil and Saga Petroleum to the
energy/industry ministry in December.  The study covered expanding
existing gas processing facilities at the two sites as well as exports
and onshore pipelines.  Aasgard gas is relatively high in carbon
dioxide and because Kaarstoe has limited opportunities for diluting
this content by mixing in other export gas, the carbon dioxide may have
to be removed after 2005.  This does not pose a problem at Kollsnes,
which would be able to add Troll gas low in carbon dioxide before
onward transmission to Continental Europe.

The possible cost of a new fractionating plant at Kollsnes is put at Kr
4.3bn ($677m), including the landfall.  Taking the gas to Kaarstoe
would cost Kr 3bn, involving new construction and modifications to
existing facilities.

IEA FORECASTS NEW PEAK FOR NORTH SEA OIL PRODUCTION

North Sea oil output is set to reach new heights by the end of the
decade, according to the International Energy Agency.  In a new
forecast, the Paris-based agency says production will peak in 1999 at
the earliest, at around 7m b/d, or some 1.6m b/d higher than last
year's level.  Just under half of this - 3.2m b/d - will come from the
UK sector and the rest from Norway, with small amounts from minor
producers such as Denmark and the Netherlands.  The IEA believes this
year's increase will amount to 740,000 b/d, "split almost equally
between the two sectors".

The agency says the common view has long been that North Sea production
would reach its peak in the mid-1990s and fall away quite sharply after
that.  But the new peak "is substantially higher and later than recent
conventional wisdom would have suggested, with consequent repercussions
for the medium-term oil market".  The IEA also expects that the
subsequent decline will be more gentle than forecast as more large
fields are brought on stream and smaller satellite fields are developed
alongside existing ones.

The IEA says earlier estimates suggested the decline rate for the North
Sea would be more than three times as large as that now predicted.  It
attributes the surge in North Sea oil production to improvements in
recovery technology, a highly skilled local workforce and heightened
fiscal incentives for offshore oil companies.  The growing role of gas
also enables more mixed oil and gasfields to be developed.

The study also shows that original reserve estimates have tended to be
too conservative.  Technology-induced cost reductions have enabled
companies to re-classify as economically recoverable oil that was once
considered to be uneconomic to produce.  The agency notes that of the
400 oil and gas prospects identified in the UK sector during the past
30 years, only 143 had been brought into production by the end of 1994.

NIGG TERMINAL CARRIES OUT FIRST TRANSFER OF ALBA CRUDE

The first Alba ship-to-ship crude oil transfer to use the Nigg terminal
in northeast Scotland took place last December, Chevron reports.  Using
a berth at the terminal, 510,000 barrels were transferred from the
shuttle tanker Tove Knudsen to the 97,000-tonne Vesta for onward
shipment to a Chevron refinery in the Gulf of Mexico.  Previously, Alba
cargoes destined for buyers outside Europe were transhipped through the
Norwegian port of Mongstad.  But with new Norwegian fields coming on
stream the Alba asset team had to look elsewhere for a transhipment
facility.  Alba's current average production of 86,000 b/d requires
offloading from the FSU to the shuttle tanker every seven days.

*  A further #0.5m has been shaved from Britannia drilling costs
following the elimination of the entire 133/8-inch casing string from
well M4, drilled by the Sovereign Explorer at the subsea centre
location.  The drilling programme, which also involves the Sedco 711,
is already 11% ahead of schedule.

CHEVRON WINS APPROVAL TO SWITCH FROM UNST TO SCATSTA

The Shetland Islands Council has agreed to Chevron's proposal to use
the airfield at Scatsta for transfers of flights between Aberdeen and
Northern North Sea oilfields.  As a result, from April 1 this year the
company together with joint venture partners Unocal and Oryx will cease
using Unst.  Chevron procurement and logistics services manager Brian
Mountain said the decision had been based on economic factors.  The SIC
also granted outline planning permission for a hangar for two
helicopters which will be erected after flights begin.  The contracts
for airline services on the new route have yet to be awarded.  The use
of Scatsta allows the joint venture to be expanded by the inclusion of
BP, which further enhances the economics of the new routing.

CONOCO UPS MURDOCH RESERVES ON BACK OF NEW WELL

Conoco has increased its estimate of gas reserves in the Murdoch Field
from a 1994 figure of 222.5 Bcf to 351 Bcf following results from a new
production well and better-than-expected reservoir performance.  Well
D6 was drilled in an area initially thought to be unpromising after an
early discovery well performed poorly and the area had been avoided
when the field's five original producers were drilled.  However,
analysis of the geology and the results of a major 3D seismic survey
suggested the initial well had intersected a badly-faulted area,
missing the high permeability sweet spots in the reservoir.

D6 was drilled horizontally and has become the best performing well in
the field, and possibly even the best producing Carboniferous well in
the Southern North Sea, says Conoco in a house paper.  With a
horizontal section of 1,635 ft, it is also the longest horizontal well
drilled in the formation, it adds.  Existing production wells have also
performed better than expected and it is estimated they will ultimately
recover more than 90% of the gas to which they are connected.

Murdoch's field life is also likely to be extended by a number of years
following the installation of a compression platform this year and
commercial agreements with other operators to use the facilities as a
hub for developments in the area.  Agreements are being finalised for
Murdoch facilities to handle production from Shell's Schooner Field and
there are several other potential tie-in prospects in the area, none of
which would be economic on a stand-alone basis.  Further 3D seismic
will shortly be evaluated and three more exploration wells are likely
to be drilled over this year, with perhaps two more in 1997.

*  The decision to pipe excess associated gas in MacCulloch rather than
flaring it put the cost of development above Conoco's #6 ($9.3) a
barrel development target, the company says.  However, during the
design and construction phase the project will be fine-tuned to reduce
costs to meet the #6 target.

JOHN SHAW BACK IN MARKET AFTER SHELL DEFERS KINGFISHER START

The Sonat Offshore semi-submersible John Shaw is back in the market
from November 1996 as a result of Shell deferring plans to develop the
Kingfisher Field in the UK sector.  Drilling of an initial six
development wells was scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 1996
and a provisional letter of intent had been issued to Sonat for the
John Shaw subject to the project go-ahead (NSL 1037/10).  It is
understood that Shell deferred the project after the failure to find a
satisfactory export solution and concerns over prevailing low gas
prices.  No details are known of any revised schedule for the
development.  The John Shaw is currently on contract with Amerada Hess
in the UK until the end of October 1996.

Shell still has potential requirements for semi-submersibles for Curlew
Field drilling from the fourth quarter of 1996 and a possible
exploration programme starting in the second half of the year.  The
John Shaw together with the Sedco 711 are likely to be a candidates for
both these programmes should they be progressed by Shell.

TOTAL TAKING SOVEREIGN EXPLORER FOR UK AND EIRE DEEPWATER PROGRAMME

Total Oil Marine is finalising the fixture of the Sedco Forex semi
Sovereign Explorer for a five-well deepwater drilling programme in the
UK and Eire starting around August 1996.  The contract is expected to
last around a year and includes three deepwater wells in the UK sector
west of Shetland plus a well in the Porcupine Trough west of Eire.  The
programme is also understood to include a high pressure well in the
northern UK sector of the North Sea.  It is possible that one of the
west of Shetland slots could be assigned to another operator and it is
understood that Conoco could be one prospect.

The Sovereign Explorer is currently drilling development wells for
Chevron on the Britannia Field together with the Sedco 711.  Based on
current progress both rigs are expected to complete the Britannia work
in the third quarter of 1996.

ELF INVITES BIDS FOR ELGIN/FRANKLIN DRILLING

Elf has issued tender invitations for two heavy-duty jack-up
requirements for Phase II development drilling on its Elgin/Franklin
project starting in 1997 and 1998.  Water depth at the central UK
sector location is 92 metres and the programme involves drilling of
deep high pressure, high temperature wells lasting about six months
apiece.  Rig 1 is planned to start in mid-1997 and Rig 2 in mid-1998.
Both units are being offered a firm contract of 30 months plus four,
one-well options plus a further six, one-month completion options.  The
closing date for the submission of bids is February 19.

Elf has already fixed the jack-up Galaxy I for Phase I development
drilling starting in October 1996.  The Santa Fe unit has been
contracted for a firm period of 18 months but this could be extended to
six years.  It appears that, depending on the approach adopted, one of
the Phase II requirements could be against the extension of the Galaxy
I.  However, it is also possible that Elf could opt to use three rigs
on the project by drilling simultaneously on Elgin with two jack-ups.

Availability of suitable existing rigs for Elf's requirement is fairly
limited.  Another Santa Fe jack-up, the Magellan, should be free in the
third quarter of 1997, while the Rowan Gorilla II and Rowan Gorilla IV
are both currently available in North America and Trinidad from the
third quarter of 1996.  The Rowan newbuilding Rowan Gorilla V is due
for delivery in 1998.

The Maersk Guardian is expected to complete the firm phase of its
current contract with Amoco Norway in March 1998, while the Maersk
Gallant is firm with Phillips Petroleum Norway until October 1997.
However, both rigs have extension options outstanding.  A number of
contractors are planning to offer newbuilding units to Elf, but these
would only be an option for the mid-1998 programme given the lead times
involved.

BP RENEWS BENREOCH FOR A FURTHER 12 MONTHS TO MAY 1997

BP has negotiated a new fixture of the semi Benreoch for 12 months from
May 1996.  The rig was bought recently from Ben Line by Stena Offshore,
which has negotiated the new deal with BP.  The Benreoch is currently
on contract with BP until April.  It has completed a one-well
assignment to Texaco and is waiting on weather to return to BP to drill
well 9/9C-16, which is expected to last about 90 days.  The rig is then
due to undergo inspection and survey before beginning the new BP
contract.

BP still has gaps in its drilling sequence with the Benreoch but is
examining the requirements of its internal asset groups before making
any firm moves to assign slots externally.  However, it is understood
that both Conoco and Shell could be interested in taking sublets of the
rig in 1996 should the opportunity arise.  In addition to the Benreoch
fixture, BP still has a requirement for a semi to drill an HPHT well in
central UK sector block 22/25 spudding around September 1996.

*  BP has confirmed a one-well extension of the jack-up F G McClintock
retaining the rig in the southern UK sector until May 1996.  Thereafter
BP's plans are not yet firm, but it is thought likely the operator will
retain the Neddrill 7 through the year while releasing the McClintock.

ROWAN SECURES DUTCH FIXTURES FOR JACK-UP RIGS

Rowan Drilling has secured fixtures for two of its jack-ups in the
Netherlands.  The Cecil Provine has been contracted by Elf Petroland to
drill two wells starting early in March plus an option for a third
well.  The Rowan California has been fixed by Wintershall, also for a
two-well programme, but starting at the end of January and with options
for up to three additional wells.  The firm wells are in blocks K/10
and L/8 and are expected to last a total of 160 days.

Both jack-ups are currently in the UK but their transfer to Holland is
indicative of increasing demand in the Dutch market taking up the slack
in the UK being created partly by concerns about the gas price.  The
Rowan California is currently stacked off Great Yarmouth after being
released by Phillips Petroleum.  The Cecil Provine is drilling its
final well for Amoco after the operator chose not to exercise its last
one-well option.

Elf Petroland in turn has chosen not to exercise its final one-well
option with the jack-up Ensco 85, which it will now release early in
March.  The rig will then enter the yard a modification programme,
expected to last 10-20 days, prior to beginning a one-year contract
with NAM.

BHP ISSUES INQUIRY FOR UK JACK-UP PROGRAMMES

BHP Petroleum has issued a market inquiry for two UK sector jack-up
requirements.  It is interested in rig availability for one well in
Irish Sea block 110/13 spudding in April 1996 and for a four to six-
month programme in the Southern North Sea starting in June 1996.
Replies including indicative dayrates are requested by January 12.

BHP's rig options for the Irish Sea well appear to be limited.  The
Glomar Adriatic XI is already committed for much of 1996 and is
pencilled in for BHP in the fourth quarter of the year.  There appears
to be little prospect of a slot opening up for BHP in the second
quarter.  BHP already has the Trident XIV on contract through 1996 on
Liverpool Bay development work and there are currently no other jack-
ups in the Irish Sea.

A number of jack-ups are due to come available in the North Sea
including the Maersk Enhancer in February/March and the F G McClintock
in May.  However, contractors may be unlikely to make a competitive
offer to mobilise a rig from the North Sea for just one well unless it
can be pegged back-to-back with BHP's Southern North Sea programme.

NORSK HYDRO REMAINS OPEN FOR EXPLORATION SEMI FOR 1997

Although it has not made any formal moves in the market, Norsk Hydro is
looking for a semi for general exploration work in Norway in 1997 for a
period of up to one year.  The programme is not yet firmed up and
ultimately the duration of the contract is also likely to depend to
some extent on the rig selected.  With Norwegian rig availability very
tight, Hydro is keeping a close watch on the market and is maintaining
ongoing discussions with contractors to enable it to make a quick
decision when the right rig becomes available at the right price.

Norsk Hydro is also part of a consortium with Statoil and Saga awaiting
for the announcement of Norwegian 15th round licence awards before
proceeding with the fixture of a rig for a shared deepwater drilling
programme on the Voering Plateau starting end-1996 or early in 1997.

*  Amerada, Conoco, Deminex, Mobil and Shell continue to discuss the
prospects for sharing the term fixture of a semi-submersible to drill
one or two wells apiece in the Norwegian sector from around the second
quarter of 1996.  Rigs which could be available include the Byford
Dolphin or at a later date the Nanhai VI, which is in China.  However,
it remains to be seen whether rates sought by contractors to cover the
cost of the significant upgrading required for Norway will be within
the limits set by the likes of Conoco and Shell which have already
abandoned one tender round late last year as rates bid were considered
to be too high.  While examining the options for rig sharing, all five
operators also remain open to sublet opportunities on an individual
basis.

WEST ALPHA EN ROUTE FROM CHINA TO NORTH SEA

The semi West Alpha has left China and is en route to Singapore to pick
up a wet tow back to the North Sea.  The journey is scheduled to last
about 90 days.  The rig is committed to Esso Norge for a two-year
development drilling programme on the Balder Field starting in mid-
April.  Ahead of the West Alpha, the Byford Dolphin is due in the UK or
Norway between January 17 and 27 subject to weather after mobilising
from the Far East.  Dolphin is due to receive bids from seven yards for
upgrading work including installation of additional columns and a
derrick extension.  The rig is planned to be available in the North Sea
from March 1996.  The Transocean Seeker is due in the North Sea at the
beginning of February at the end of its journey from the Far East.  It
too is still available and is expected to enter the market in April.

Elsewhere in the market, the Ocean Alliance is due out of the Cromarty
Firth at the weekend to return to work for BP, while the Sedco 704 is
due in the Firth for survey work before resuming operations for Shell
on the Gannet Field as a drilling tender.

Northwest European jack-up drilling rig utilisation dipped slightly at
the end of 1995 with the release of the Rowan California by Phillips
Petroleum in the UK and the entry of the Ensco 70 to the Verolme yard
in Holland for upgrading.  The Ensco jack-up is due to return to work
for NAM at the end of February equipped with a new 15,000 psi BOP stack
among other improvements.  The California is stacked off Great Yarmouth
until the end of January when it is due to mobilise for Wintershall in
Holland.

SIRI DISCOVERY COULD BE FAST-TRACKED FOR 1998 START

Siri-1 is a "substantial" discovery, which "appears commercial" and
could be on stream by 1998, according to operator Statoil Denmark.  The
find, which late last year tested at rates of 5,988 b/d of oil (NSL
1037/20), is estimated by the operator to contain 150m barrels of
recoverable oil.  The discovery well is understood to have intercepted
a thick section of sands in a well defined but are really limited
structure.  Reservoir permeability is reported as very good.   The find
has been made in Palaeocene sandstones, outside the Central Graben
area, generating considerable excitement in the Danish Energy Ministry.
 Most Danish fields produce from chalk.

Statoil is already looking at a floating production project for Siri.
Svein Larsen, head of operations in Denmark, said:  "We will be
establishing a core team soon to get Siri quickly on stream and our
ambition is to begin production by 1998."  At the moment the favoured
concept for the field, which lies in around 60 metres of water, is an
FPSO.  This Spring Statoil will shoot 3D seismic and is planning an
appraisal in the Autumn.

The semisub Deepsea Bergen abandoned Siri-1 on December 24 and is now
back with Statoil in the Norwegian sector, where it spudded exploration
well 25/10-6S on December 26.  The  well was abandoned because the hole
was too small in dimensions for production purposes.

AMOCO ABANDONS NOEKKEN DUSTER

Amoco is in the process of abandoning Noekken prospect exploration well
2/8-15 as a dry hole, the NPD confirmed this week.  The semisub Vildkat
Explorer has been delayed by weather but is due off location later this
week when it will head to exploration well 34/11-2S for Statoil.  Well
2/8-15 was drilled to a TD of 3,725 metres and completed in rocks of
Upper Cretaceous age, said the NPD.  There was no test.

HYDRO PREPARES TO RUN ONE TEST ON OSEBERG AREA DISCOVERY

Norsk Hydro is preparing to run a single test on exploration well 30/8-
1Sre, having reached a TVD of 4,767 metres with the semisub Treasure
Saga.  The well encountered gas in Brent formations before being
deepened to examine the Statfjord beneath (NSL 1031/9).  Given that the
Brent shows were described as a significant discovery, it is likely
this horizon is being tested, which could imply the Statfjord proved
barren.  The operator would not confirm the interval which it was
intending to test.

Meanwhile, on the western side of block 30/8, Hydro has abandoned
wildcat 30/8-2 with the semisub West Vanguard, having drilled down to a
TD of 2,405 metres.  The well is untested and understood to be a
disappointment.  The West Vanguard was earlier this week waiting on
weather to get off location.  It goes next to the Oseberg Field for
development drilling duties.

VESLEFRIKK WILDCAT TURNS UP SMALL FIND

An exploration well drilled from the Veslefrikk platform to examine a
separate structure to the west, has turned up a small find, according
to the NPD.  Well 30/3-7S encountered hydrocarbons in Mid-Jurassic
sandstones before being suspended (NSL 1036/12).  The NPD said the find
was probably small, but a planned production test will establish the
type of hydrocarbons present and reservoir characteristics.  Positive
test results would lead to the well being tied back to the Veslefrikk
platform for production.  The well was drilled to a TVD of 3,994
metres.

DRILLING ACTIVITY UPDATE, NEW SPUDS AND COMPLETIONS

In the UK sector Amerada has spudded Fife development well 31/26A-A7
with the semisub High Seas Driller having completed development re-
entry 31/26A-A4 on December 28.  The semisub Kan Tan IV on December 30
spudded exploration well 21/16-4, south of the Durward prospect, for
Amerada.  The rig had previously abandoned Chevron's Irish sector
wildcat 56/15-1 after disappointing results (NSL 1037/14).  Amoco
reports the jack-up Cecil Provine completed Bessemer development well
49/23-E2 as a gas producer on December 23 and the same day spudded
Beaufort development well 49/23-E3.

Arco is waiting on weather to move off tight exploration well 50/26A-7,
which is now complete.  It is thought the well, which is believed to be
untested, will be abandoned.  The rig goes next to spud exploration
well 49/28-17 for Arco.  BP reports it is expecting the semisub Ocean
Alliance out of Cromarty by next week to spud west of Shetland
appraisal 204/25B-6.  It is not clear at this stage what prospect this
well is appraising.  It lies to the east of last year's tight
exploration well 204/25B-5, southeast of Foinaven.  Elsewhere, BP is
expecting the semisub Benreoch shortly from Texaco to spud exploration
well 9/9C-16.  The rig is carrying out some construction work in the
Erskine area, having completed development well 23/26B-20.  BP also
reports the semisub Transocean 8 has completed Andrew development well
16/28-A3 and on January 1 spudded 16/28-A4.

British Gas spudded Crosby prospect exploration well 110/14-5, with the
jack-up Glomar Adriatic XI, on December 26.  The rig abandoned
Laggantulloch prospect exploration well 111/15-1 as a tight hole on
December 23.  The well is understood to be dry (NSL 1037/14).  Over the
Christmas period Chevron has completed two more Britannia Field
development wells - 15/30-M4, with the semisub Sovereign Explorer, and
16/26-B5, with the semisub Sedco 711.  The former spudded 15/30-M5 on
December 26, while the latter spudded 16/26-B6 on December 28.

Conoco has reached TD on exploration well 15/19-7, to the north of the
MacCulloch Field.  The semisub Sedco Explorer is operating.  This well
is understood to be targeting a Piper prospect.  There has been no news
yet of any planned test programme.  On exploration well 22/19B-5,
Conoco kicked off a mechanical sidetrack with the semisub Drill Star on
January 2.  The rig is now drilling ahead.  Kerr-McGee spudded the
second back-to-back Janice prospect appraisal 30/17A-12, with the
semisub Transocean 9, on December 30.  Appraisal 30/17A-11 was
suspended after a successful test programme (NSL 1036/12).

Phillips completed Deborah development well 48/30-14, with the jack-up
Rowan California, on December 21, releasing the rig to stack.  Oryx has
been delayed completing Lyell workover 3/2-A08z, with the semisub
Neddrill 6.  This well is being converted from a producer to an
injector.  Depending on the weather the operator now expects to be able
to finish operations next week.  Shell has run into mechanical problems
on both of its current Central North Sea E&A wells.  Shearwater
appraisal 22/30B-15 has still not managed to get started on a test
programme.  The jack-up Galaxy 1 has been operating at TD since mid-
November.  NSL now estimates this well is likely to be operational
until late-February, unless Shell postpones the testing programme.  On
deep exploration well 22/29-6 the semisub Henry Goodrich is plugging
back and preparing to kick off a second mechanical sidetrack having run
into problems downhole.

In the southern basin, Shell may soon have better news to report.  The
jack-up Britannia is reported to be operating at a TD of 10,768 ft on
Hamlet prospect exploration well 49/24-20 having run 7-inch liner,
which could imply a test programme.  In the Northern North Sea Shell
reports the semisub Sedco 712 has spudded Osprey development well
211/23A-P7, having completed P4.  Texaco is understood to be close to
completing exploration well 15/29A-11, with the semisub Glomar Arctic
III.

In the Norwegian sector Amoco is drilling the first new well from the
Valhall WP platform - 2/8-F1.  The jack-up Maersk Guardian completed
batch setting casing early in December.  In the Dutch sector Amoco
reports the jack-up Arch Rowan spudded exploration well P/11-2 on
December 29.  Occidental spudded exploration well L/11-A2 on December
23, with the jack-up Neddrill 3 and NAM reports the jack-up Ensco 70
suspended exploration well L/13-17re as a gas well, following a test,
on December 21.  The rig is in port undergoing an upgrade.

ENTERPRISE BOOSTS NELSON AREA ACREAGE IN FARM-IN DEAL WITH BP

Enterprise Oil is acquiring licence interests in four blocks close to
its Central North Sea Nelson Field.  Under a farm-in agreement with BP,
Enterprise is acquiring significant equity stakes in blocks 21/9 (30%),
21/15A (30%), 21/15B (35%) and 22/12A (40%).  In return, the company is
paying BP's share of the costs of a major 3D seismic survey covering
the three blocks (NSL 1023/10).  The survey, which got under way in
October but was suspended the following month due to poor weather, is
scheduled to be re-started early this year.

In a separate deal, Enterprise is acquiring Kerr-McGee's equity in
block 21/15A, bringing its stake in the acreage to about 36.25%.  In
addition, the company has secured a 45% holding in block 22/7,
immediately northeast of Nelson.  The interest was acquired through an
acreage swap with Elf in 1994 and a cash purchase from Total in 1995.
Following the deals, Enterprise will have equity interests in 14 blocks
in the Nelson area.

"These deals provide an excellent opportunity to capitalise on our
knowledge of the Nelson area where we will now have the leading acreage
position," says Mark Hope, Enterprise's UK general manager.  "We
believe interpretation of the new seismic, together with a thorough
review of all existing data, will provide new drilling opportunities in
an area where existing infrastructure would allow small discoveries to
be developed profitably," he adds.

The Nelson Field, discovered in 1988, has been producing oil at rates
of up to 190,000 b/d since coming on stream in February 1994.  Two
existing oil finds - 21/15-2, drilled in 1981, and 22/12-1, drilled in
1988 - are to be evaluated with a view to further appraisal in the
future.

ABBOT LAUNCHES #7.8M BID FOR OIS

Abbot Group, the oil and gas services group, late last month launched
an all-share offer for OIS International which values the technical
inspection concern at #7.8m ($24.5m).  Abbot is offering one share for
every two OIS shares, with a cash alternative of 24.5p.  Abbot chairman
Alasdair Locke urged OIS shareholders to accept the offer.  "The
fundamental problems of OIS under its present management run so deep
that there can be little foreseeable chance of a significant
improvement in levels of profits," he said.  OIS shareholders should
benefit from improved performance of the company as part of the wider
Abbot group, he added.

HSE INVESTIGATES UK YARD BLAST THAT CLAIMED THREE LIVES

The Health and Safety Executive is investigating the death of three
workers at Amec Process and Energy's Howdon yard, Tyneside, on December
21, following a catastrophic pressure release.  The men were carrying
out pressure tests on the pipework of a new module for Maersk Oil and
Gas's Tyra West project, when it is understood high-pressure nitrogen
escaped into the atmosphere at high velocity.  Four other men suffered
minor injuries and shock.  The HSE said:  "Our investigation will
continue until we have found the reason for the accident.  The
investigation will not only look at the physical evidence, but those
working at the site will be interviewed.  We will also examine whether
there have been any breaches of health and safety law."

The yard remained closed over Christmas and New Year, following the
tragedy, but re-opened on January 3.  However, work on the Tyra module
involved remained suspended until the end of last week while the HSE
continued its investigations.  The HSE is expected to publish a report
on its preliminary findings shortly.

ENSCO 92 ACCIDENT VICTIM DIES

The crewman injured on board the jack-up Ensco 92 late last year (NSL
1037/18), died in hospital shortly afterwards, Arco British has
confirmed.  The rig was working for Arco on exploration well 50/26A-7,
which has now been completed.  The rig is waiting on weather to move
off location to exploration well 49/28-17.  The HSE continues to
investigate the circumstances of the accident.

The crewman is believed to have suffered serious head and neck injuries
when he was hit by a high-pressure release of nitrogen gas from a
cylinder during a lifting operation.  Initial reports suggest a
"nitrogen quad" (a rack of 48 bottles of nitrogen) was being lifted by
a crane when one of the slings caught under a valve releasing gas at an
estimated pressure of 4,400 psi.  The casualty was knocked back against
the engine room bulkhead.
