<P>
Photonics is the control, manipulation, transfer and storage of energy and information using photons - the fundamental particles of light. The research goal of the Australian Photonics CRC is to utilise the almost limitless capacity of optical fibres to transmit large volumes of information.
 The CRC, established as an unincorporated joint venture in 1992, brings together most of the major players in photonic technology in Australia in a seven-year, $100 million enterprise. The CRC has three divisions in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. Australian Photonics Pty Ltd is the technology marketing and licensing agent of the CRC.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The principal focus of the CRC is on the development of optoelectronic circuits, and photonic networks and systems for communications, information processing, sensing optical wave guide devices and industrial applications through collaborative research between its university and industry partners.
The CRC has established research links with institutions in the UK, Europe and the USA and is developing similar links with groups in the Asia-Pacific region.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
The centre has developed a large range of components and systems commercialised and adopted by the telecommunications, electrical power and steel manufacturing industries. Computer-aided learning software is being sold in Australia and Europe. Facilities established include:
<UL>
<LI>a Product Incubator facility in Sydney allowing industry access to optical fibre facilities;
<LI>an Optoelectronic Product Development Facility in Melbourne in conjunction with the Advanced Engineering CRC for Manufacturing, allowing easy industry access to optoelectronics systems laboratories; and
<LI>an Application Specific Optical Fibre manufacturing facility and sales to industry in Australia and overseas.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The CRC is Australia's principal resource in optical fibre and photonic technology for research development, education and training, and commercialisation. It aims to assist photonics become a major industry of the 21st century.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Five of the members of the CRC are located in Victoria, including the world-acclaimed Photonics Research Laboratory at the University of Melbourne, Telstra Research Laboratories (Photonics Group), Siemens, Fibernet and NEC.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The CRC offers postgraduate research training and a postgraduate Diploma in Optical Fibre Technology, elements of which will be available through a Computer Managed Learning Program. A successful short course program is available to technical and managerial staff in industry throughout Australia and can be provided within the Asia-Pacific region.
The CRC typically runs several workshops a year in Photonics usually in Melbourne or Sydney and further training opportunities are planned in Optoelectronics and Photonics. The CRC also provides customised industry training.
<P>
<H3>Participants</H3>
Australian National University, CSIRO, Electricity Commission of NSW, Fibernet Pty Ltd, NEC Australia Ltd, Telstra Corporation Ltd, Siemens Ltd, University of Melbourne, University of NSW and University of Sydney.
<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The CRC is strongly committed to bridging the gap between the creation of technology and its exploitation by industry in the form of products and services. The focus of the R&D effort of the CRC is to develop commercial opportunities for its members and industry through applications projects, an affiliates program, and product development/incubator facilities in Melbourne and Sydney.
Commercialisation opportunities for hardware will exist in the development of components for the fibre network, and in the technology of the photonic/electronic interface to be used in the office or home. The CRC has the opportunity to participate in establishing the standards for this industry, and to be the springboard for significant commercial global participation.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
The Australian Photonics CRC program is a seven-year, $100 million enterprise jointly funded by industry and government.
