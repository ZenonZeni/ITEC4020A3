<title> Wind Plants of California's 

San Gorgonio Pass </title>

<head><b><h1>Wind Plants<p>

 of California's San Gorgonio Pass</h1></b></head><p>

<body>



The San Gorgonio Pass near Palm Springs hosts the third 

largest concentration of wind turbines in California. There 

are more than 3,500 wind turbines located in the pass, many 

massed on the floor of the Whitewater Wash (an ephemeral 

stream) against the dramatic backdrop of Mount San Jacinto.<p>

<h3>Wind Turbines on Whitewater Wash</h3></center><p>





Many of the wind turbines on the Wash were installed during the height of 

California's great <i>wind rush</i> in the early 1980s. The wind turbines 

in these wind plants were installed much closer together than in modern 

arrays, creating a veritable <i>forest.</i> These older turbines are also 

less reliable and operate less frequently than contemporary designs. <p>



Some of the older turbines have already been removed as wind companies 

begin to <i>repower</i> the aging wind plants with newer more cost 

effective wind turbines.<p>



Only two hours east of Hollywood, the wind turbines near 

Palm Springs have appeared in several movies, including 

<i>Rain Man.</i><p>
