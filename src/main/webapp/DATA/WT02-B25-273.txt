<H2>1997 Key Legislative Priorities</H2>

<font color="#FF0000" size="3">National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) </font>- NIMH is the principal federal 
agency in charge of funding biomedical research into brain disorders.  Through its $701 
million budget, NIMH supports and conducts an integrated program of basic and clinical 
research and research training in biology, neuroscience and epidemiology.  Research 
initiatives include programs in major brain disorders such as schizophrenia, major 
depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Over the 
past two years, NIMH has received important increases in funding through the bipartisan 
leadership of Representatives John Edward Porter (R-IL) and Louis Stokes (D-OH) and 
Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Tom Harkin (D-IA).  <STRONG>NAMI strongly supported 
these efforts and pledges to work to enact similar increases in FY 1998 in order to 
ensure that there are adequate resources for promising research into brain disorders 
and genetics and support for initiatives focused on neural receptors, receptor 
subtypes and modulators. </STRONG> The 105th Congress is expected to consider legislation 
reauthorizing NIMH.  <STRONG>NAMI supports changes in the NIMH mission that will place 
greater emphasis on the most serious brain disorders, including schizophrenia, 
major depression and bipolar disorder, in its research portfolio.
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Managed Care</font> - Faced with mounting insurance costs, more and more employers are 
choosing to administer coverage of serious brain disorders through managed care.  Many 
of these managed care organizations (MCOs) administer plans that have discriminatory 
treatment limits and out-of-pocket limits for mental illness.  Passage of the Domenici-
Wellstone Mental Illness Parity Act in 1996 marked a major step forward in ending 
discrimination in insurance coverage.  However, much more needs to be done.  A major 
concern for NAMI members are the methods used by for-profit MCOs to limit access to 
medically necessary treatment.  The shift toward managed care in both private and public 
health insurance systems does offer much promise for expanding access to treatment, 
particularly for families and consumers who previously did not have access to mental 
illness coverage.  In addition, managed care offers tremendous potential for uncovering 
effective treatment through outcome measures.  However, the shift toward managed care 
must also be watched closely to measure its impact on individuals with the most serious 
illnesses.  <STRONG>NAMI supports efforts to make managed care more accountable through 
improved outcome measures and more open to input from families and consumers. </STRONG>
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">FDA Reform & Access to Pharmaceuticals</font> - Reform of the process by which 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
is a major concern for Congress.  Even though legislation was not passed in 1996, FDA 
reform is certain to remain high on the legislative agenda in 1997.  The FDA regulatory 
process and access to new medications is a major concern for NAMI.  Recent advances in 
pharmacology and drug therapies offer tremendous promise for individuals with 
schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder and obsessive-
compulsive disorder.  Unfortunately, many of these new drugs have taken years to get 
through the FDA regulatory process and are prohibitively expensive for individuals and 
families that do not have access to health insurance coverage.  <STRONG>NAMI supports efforts to 
maintain the FDA's traditional role of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of all 
prescription drugs in the marketplace.  NAMI also supports efforts to streamline the 
FDA approval process in order to accelerate research and development of new drugs 
and ensure that the promising therapies reach consumers and families as quickly as 
possible.  NAMI also supports development of a new federal program designed to 
finance purchase of drugs for serious brain disorders such as schizophrenia, where 
the costs of new medications (e.g., risperdal and clozapine) is prohibitively expensive 
for people without access to insurance coverage.   
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Medicaid</font> - Medicaid is a joint state-federal program that meets the health care needs of 
persons on SSI cash assistance and other low-income families.  Medicaid is also an 
important source of funding for critical outpatient services for people with severe mental 
illness.  Over the past few years, states have moved to reform their Medicaid programs by 
contracting out mental illness coverage to MCOs through managed care "carve outs."  In 
many cases, these "carve outs" have improved the availability of services in the public 
mental health system.  However, in some cases, these programs are posing great danger to 
the public treatment system as for-profit companies drain precious resources and impose 
dangerously low "capitation" rates on providers.  <STRONG>NAMI supports efforts at the federal 
level to impose standards on Medicaid managed care plans to ensure adequate 
treatment resources for people with serious brain disorders, greater accountability 
and improved consumer and family input.  NAMI is encouraged by recent 
projections which show Medicaid spending growing at its lowest rate in over a 
decade (down to 3.5% in FY 1996) and is hopeful that this progress will eliminate 
the need for reforms that would limit treatment for people with brain disorders.   </STRONG> 
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Medicare </font>- Medicare is an important program for individuals with brain disorders 
receiving SSDI cash assistance.  While it finances both inpatient treatment and physician 
services, it does not pay for outpatient prescription drugs.  <STRONG>NAMI supports changes in 
the current Medicare program to improve the package of mental illness benefits 
available to beneficiaries and make it more consistent with recent advances in 
psychiatric treatment.  NAMI also supports efforts to maintain the stability of the 
Medicare Part A Trust Fund, but opposes any effort to unfairly increase premiums 
and deductibles for moderate and low-income beneficiaries.  
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Health Insurance For Children</font> - As part of his FY 1998 budget proposal, 
President Clinton is asking Congress to pass legislation to expand health insurance 
coverage for the nearly 10 million children have no health insurance (80% of whom have a 
parent in the workforce.  The President is proposing expansion of Medicaid to include 
children of working families.  A number of alternative congressional proposals would offer 
vouchers and other incentives that utilize the private health insurance market to cover 
more children.  Neither the President's plan, nor the congressional alternatives, currently 
mandate that proposed "children only" health plans offer parity for treatment for child and 
adolescent brain disorders.  <STRONG>NAMI supports inclusion of mental illness parity as part 
of any legislation to expand coverage for uninsured children of working parents.    
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Employment, Work and Income Supports for People With Brain 
Disorders </font>- People with brain disorders want to achieve work and independence.  
Unfortunately, the current public systems of income supports, vocational rehabilitation 
(VR) and training have not been responsive to their needs for long-term supports and 
services that can empower them to compete in the workplace.  NAMI recently released a 
report documenting the inability of the federal-state VR system to serve people with 
severe mental illnesses.  Congress is expected to consider legislation reforming the VR 
program through the Rehabilitation Act.  In addition, Senator James Jeffords (R-VT) and 
Representative Jim Bunning (R-KY) are expected to propose bills that would eliminate 
current disincentives to work in the SSI and SSDI programs.  <STRONG>NAMI supports efforts to 
open up the current VR system to competition and alternative providers that better 
understand the unique needs of people with brain disorders and allow innovative 
approaches that stress long-term supports and services and ongoing monitoring.  
NAMI also urges Congress to address the basic unfairness in the SSI and SSDI 
programs that penalize beneficiaries for work and take away health insurance 
coverage once earned income rises above certain levels.    
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Patient Confidentiality </font>- The Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability Act 
of 1996 (P.L. 104-191) contains "administrative simplification" provisions designed to 
improve the "efficiency" of the health care system by encouraging the development of a 
uniform, nationalized information system.  It requires HHS to develop "standards and 
requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information."  The new law 
does not contain a requirement to computerize information, but does mandate new 
standards for electronically transferred patient information.  <STRONG>NAMI is very concerned 
about the impact of these provisions in cases where health plans require providers to 
transmit sensitive patient information (including psychiatrists notes and other 
"encounter information" electronically. </STRONG> Under the new law, HHS has 18 months to 
develop standards for electronic transmission, after which health plans will have 24 months 
to bring themselves into compliance.  HHS is supposed to submit to Congress 
recommendations designed to protect patient privacy.  However, if Congress does not act 
on these recommendations within 3 years, HHS will then be required to promulgate final 
rules.  While these new federal standards are supposed to preempt existing state laws, 
current state protections relating to "privacy of individually identifiable health 
information" are not preempted, and are subject to whatever Congress passes in the future 
to protect privacy.  NAMI is currently working to ensure that legislation now being 
drafted by Senator Robert Bennett (R-UT) and Representative Gary Condit (D-CA) 
provides adequate protections to ensure privacy of patient information.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Education </font>- Congress has already begun work on legislation reauthorizing the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  Representatives William Goodling 
(R-PA) and Frank Riggs (R-CA) have introduced IDEA reauthorization legislation that 
would overhaul the current due process system to promote mediation, instead of litigation 
over a child's placement and need for services.  The bill provides parents with the right to 
access all of their child's records and participate in any decisions on placement.  The bill 
also includes controversial provisions related to student discipline and "cessation of 
services" for certain students (including a requirement for IEP teams to determine whether 
a child's action were a "manifestation" of his or her disability).  <STRONG>NAMI is very concerned 
about proposals that unfairly target for "cessation" or expulsion children with brain 
disorders such as autism and pervasive developmental disorder.   NAMI also 
supports efforts to protect recent increases in funding for special education. </STRONG> 
Congress added $783.7 million in federal Special Education funds in FY 1997.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Housing </font>- Access to decent, safe and affordable housing remains a tremendous 
challenge for people with serious brain disorders.  Recent cuts in federal funding and 
changes in federal policy (especially new rules that allow public housing authorities 
[PHAs] and assisted housing providers to designate housing as "elderly only") have 
limited housing opportunity for people with severe mental illness.  In addition, proposals 
to restrict enforcement of the Fair Housing Act could make it more difficult to combat 
"NIMBYism" that results from stigma and discrimination faced by group homes and other 
community-based housing options.  In 1996, NAMI worked closely with allies in 
Congress, including Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Representative Rodney 
Frelinghuysen (R-NJ), to add $50 million to the HUD budget for tenant-based rental 
assistance for people with disabilities who have been (and will be) adversely impacted by 
"elderly only" public and assisted housing designation.  This effort was in response to new 
rules signed into law in 1996 (Section 10 of P.L. 104-120) that are making it easier for 
PHAs to designate housing and limit low-income housing options for people with 
disabilities.  People with serious brain disorders are especially vulnerable in the "elderly 
only" housing designation process because of the stigma associated with their illnesses.  
<STRONG>NAMI will continue to push for additional tenant-based rental assistance linked to 
the emerging housing designation crisis and adequate funds for HUD Section 811, 
Shelter Plus Care and programs under the McKinney Act serving homeless persons 
with severe mental illness.  
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">SAMHSA </font>- The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA) is the principal federal agency funding services for people with serious brain 
disorders through its Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS).  CMHS's principal 
program is the Mental Health Services Block Grant ($275.4 million) which directs funds 
to state mental health agencies for community-based services.  These fund represent a 
small, but important, source of funds for state mental health agencies.  Other CMHS 
programs include PATH ($20 million), Childrens' Mental Health ($69 million) and PAIMI 
($19.8 million).  CMHS also directs "demonstration" funds through its Knowledge, 
Development and Application (KDA) program ($58 million).  In 1996, Congress failed to 
reauthorize SAMHSA as a result of controversy over eligibility of faith-based non-profit 
providers for SAMHSA programs.  Thus, reauthorization legislation must be written in 
1997.  <STRONG>NAMI supports changes in SAMHSA programs that will focus greater 
attention on the needs of persons with the most serious brain disorders.
