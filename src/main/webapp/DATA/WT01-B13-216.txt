ALT="Why Mutual Funds Waive Expenses">
<BR>
Mutual funds pursuing the same investment objective can be compared on the basis of any number of characteristics. A significant difference between their returns, however, may be a sign that a fund is either having its operating expenses absorbed or management fees waived by its investment advisor. Although they're often offered on equity funds, you're most likely to notice the effect of an absorption or waiver in the yields of a bond or money market mutual fund.  Their presence can explain how a fund is able to provide a relatively higher return to shareholders.

<P>

A look at the fund's Summary of Expenses, which is included near the front of every mutual fund prospectus, usually will reveal whether expenses are being absorbed or fees are being waived. A footnote to the summary should disclose the existence and effects of an absorption or a waiver. The Financial Highlights of a fund, included in both the prospectus and fund financial statements, also show what the expense ratio and net investment income ratio would be with and without the waivers. This information will give you some idea of how the waivers affect performance. 

<P>

Investment advisors are most likely to absorb out-of-pocket expenses or to waive management fees when they have just introduced a fund. Although every fund is capitalized with seed money from the investment advisor, one of its goals is to grow as soon as possible. Every fund needs to attain a certain size in order to initiate investments, diversify and properly pursue its investment strategy.  One of the best ways of attracting new assets is by lowering shareholder expenses and fees. 

<P>

The decision of how much to absorb and/or waive -- and for how long -- is more art than science. The difference must be enough to serve as an incentive. A new income fund whose fees and/or expenses are being waived may offer a 40 to 80 basis point (0.40 percent to .80 percent) yield advantage, for example. This tends to be sufficient to attract new shareholders.

<P>

Waivers typically remain in place for a limited time, after which the investment advisor will gradually reinstate the waived costs and fees to the fund. It is hoped that the fund will be large enough to better absorb the waived fees by the time they are added back.

<P>

Such waivers are common with fund introductions. Some investment advisors also make a practice of waiving the expenses and fees of a more mature fund. When this is done and the fund is thereby able to produce a higher yield, the investment advisor is making a marketing decision to incur the fund's expenses and forgo fee income in favor of asset growth for the fund. The reason for this strategy is that a larger fund will provide certain economies of scale that should lead to reduced ongoing costs. You should know, though, that an investment advisor typically reserves the right to stop the practice and reinstate the fund's true expenses and fees at any time.
