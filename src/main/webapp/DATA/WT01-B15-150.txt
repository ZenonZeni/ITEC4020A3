<HTML><TITLE>Multi-Purpose Canister System</TITLE>
<BODY><H2>Multi-Purpose Canister System</H2><HR>
<STRONG>In response to budgetary constraints for the civilian radioactive waste management program in fiscal year 1996, OCRWM has terminated its work on the multi-purpose canister (MPC). </STRONG><P>
<P>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended, outlines a comprehensive plan for the safe disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other forms of high-level radioactive waste. The Act requires the Department of Energy to develop a system that would accept, transport and dispose of this waste. This system would consist of a permanent geologic repository, an interim storage facility, if available, and a transportation system to move the spent nuclear fuel from the reactors and storage sites to DOE facilities. <P>
<P>
Spent nuclear fuel is generated from the use of nuclear power and is very hot and highly radioactive. To date, the vast majority of spent fuel has been stored on-site at the power plants in steel-lined pools filled with water. As pools have begun to reach capacity, additional storage capacity has been added above-ground in a dry environment inside large steel or concrete containers. Nuclear utilities have been using a variety of dry storage technologies that incorporate similar systems; however, these systems will likely require repackaging prior to transport and disposal. <P>

<H3>The Concept </H3>

Over the years, the Department of Energy has considered several different container systems. A container may serve only one purpose - for storage, transport or disposal; it may serve two purposes - for storage and transport; or it may serve three purposes - storage, transport and disposal. In early 1994, after extensive evaluation and interactions with stakeholders, the decision was made to pursue the development of a canister-based system, known as the multi-purpose canister or MPC. The MPC system was envisioned for use for all stages of the waste management system, and would allow the bare spent fuel to be handled only once for its initial packaging and never require repackaging.<p>
<P>
The multi-purpose canister would have been made of steel and other materials that limit the radiation dose to workers and the public. Inside the canister is a metal frame used to support the spent nuclear fuel assemblies, transfer heat to the outer surface, prevent nuclear criticality, and add strength to the canister. The MPC would have two lids for added strength and protection. Once spent nuclear fuel assemblies were loaded into the MPC, it would be sealed and not reopened. The canister could then be placed inside separate casks for storage, transportation and disposal. The MPC could be used for above-ground storage at either the nuclear power plant or an interim storage facility. <P>

<H3>The Design</H3> 

The MPC was designed to contain spent nuclear fuel from the two primary types of U.S. commercial reactors - boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors. Two sizes of MPC (125 tons and 75 tons) were also designed so that the MPC would be compatible with the majority of nuclear reactor sites. The weight includes the canister, spent nuclear fuel and the transportation cask. The two sizes of MPC could be used at plants with a licensed crane capacity of at least 125 tons and 75 tons, respectively. <P>
<P>
Because of the weight involved in transport, the MPC was intended for rail shipment. By using a large canister, more spent nuclear fuel could be loaded, thereby reducing the number of shipments and the possibility of transportation accidents. <P>

<H3>Environmental Consequences for Alternatives </H3>

Fabrication and deployment of a canister-based system required the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to be used in making an informed decision concerning the use of MPCs in the waste management system. The MPC EIS was to focus on comparing the environmental impacts of alternative canister systems, including single purpose, dual purpose, and multi-purpose systems. However, due to budgetary constraints for the program in fiscal year 1996, preparation of the MPC EIS was terminated. The Department of the Navy has assumed lead responsibility for preparation of a container system EIS for naval spent nuclear fuel with DOE serving as a cooperating agency.  This EIS, titled "Department of the Navy Final Environmental Impact Statement for a Container System for Management of Naval Spent Nuclear Fuel" was issued in November, 1996. <P>

<H3>Current Status and Further Considerations</H3>

In FY 1996, OCRWM decided to abandon some of its technology development activities related to spent fuel storage and transport, and to seek services and equipment for these activities from private sector sources.  Consistent with this approach, OCRWM chose not to pursue development of the MPC system beyond the initial design stage.<P>
<P>
Westinghouse, the company selected by DOE to design the MPC system, completed preliminary design and safety analysis reports in September 1996.  The Department of Energy believes that the information gained in designing the MPC components will be of value to the nuclear industry. DOE is making all information pertinent to the MPC system available to the private sector.<P>
