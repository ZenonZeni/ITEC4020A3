</H1>
<BR>

<h2>Each Pak Contains:</h2><BR>

<UL>
<LI>150 tablets   Cardio-Chelex </LI>
<LI>90 tablets     Support Tabs </LI>
<LI>64 capsules  Micro-Mins </LI>
<LI>60 tablets     Proanthenols Bio-Complex 50 mg </LI>

<P>The maQ-PAK is the more advanced Life Plus supplemental nutritional program. Like the SYNERGY PAK, it is basic to good health but contains a broader spectrum and larger quantities of more specialized products. CARDIO-CHELEX  and SUPPORT TABS provide a full array of multiple vitamins and minerals divided into two products to be taken at different times for optimum results. 
<P>This ensures you get the best of both worlds; the valuable immune system support and oral chelating cleansing of the circulatory system by CARDIO-CHELEX in the morning, plus the great anti-stress and energy benefits of SUPPORT TABS in the afternoon.
<P>In addition, the maQ-PAK contains MICRO-MINS for a full spectrum of 77 high quality, plant-derived colloidal minerals and the popular PROANTHENOLS BIO-COMPLEX antioxidant tablets that not only provide their own benefits, but help other antioxidants, like those in CARDIO-CHELEX, to work even better.
<P>The maQ-PAK also contains SUSTENASE digestive enzyme tablets that help digest food insuring you obtain the nutrients from the food you eat. 
<P>COLODYNE is also included as just one heaping teaspoonful provides a major portion of the high quality soluble fiber that you need each day, plus herbs and beneficial microflora that support colon hygiene and ecology and helps keep bowel elimination regular. COLODYNE and SUSTENASE taken together greatly reduce discomfort from digestive stress such as gas, bloating, lack of regularity and tiredness. The maQ-PAK is packaged in a re-usable, vinyl drawstring tote.

<H2>Q-PAK</H2><P>
The original "Q-PAK" name came from "Quintessence" meaning "the pure concentrated essence."  This kit helps make your nutritional program even more complete and more advanced yet simple and cost effective.  We also call the Q-PAK, the maQ-PAK (mack pack) because most Members purchase it on their Monthly Automatic qualifying program where it is automatically shipped to them each month so they don't have to remember to order it.<P><P><P> 




 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CARDIO-CHELEX </H2>

<P><A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> is specially formulated to help the body nutritionally cleanse itself of many environmental pollutants. Good circulation is extremely important, because without it oxygen and nutrients could not reach our cells, and life would come to a screeching halt. Poor circulation puts stress on all organs of the body.   Several factors contribute to poor circulation such as diet, free radicals, pollution, certain drugs and chemicals, xanthan oxidase in homogenized milk, depressed immunity, a decreased ability of the blood to digest protein and anabolic disturbances in metabolism. When blood clots have a great chance of forming, heart attack, phlebitis, and stroke are more likely. <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> is the only product in existence that contains proteolytic enzymes and is catabolically balanced. Life Plus <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> contains 47 special nutrients that work synergistically for overall nutritional support.  <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> contains Carnitine and Mucoploysaccharides. Large amounts of Vitamin A and C are included, because they are natural anti-oxidants, immune stimulants and natural cleansing agents as well. Trypsin and Chymotrypsin are potent pancreatic enzymes that naturally keep the proteolytic activity of the blood up to proper levels. <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> is designed with prevention in mind. Common symptoms of poor circulation are cold hands and feet, tiredness, high and low blood pressure, difficult breathing and diminished vision. People living in areas that have high pollution levels should strongly consider <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A>. Improved circulation can improve energy and alertness, increase stamina, and increase oxygen and nutrition to every organ of the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUPPORT TABS</H2>
<P><A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> was originally formulated to support specific needs of alcoholics.  The core formula is based on research at Rutgers University. The research was undertaken to determine specific nutritional needs for organs in the body damaged by the stress of excessive alcohol consumption. That is, to help them maintain healthy metabolic processes and also rebuild. <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> is helpful in breaking habits such as drinking alcohol, overeating, smoking and using drugs. <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> fight the afternoon "blahs" that often develop as the stress of the day wears on. The amino acids and tissue nutrients support the organs normally fatigued the most by stress, especially the adrenal glands, which are the primary organs that tight stress, the liver and pancreas.  The amino acids, concentrated tissue nutrients, specific vitamins and minerals in <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> serve as fuel for the nervous system to provide energy, but also create a natural calming effect.  They help greatly to maintain more consistent blood sugar levels helping the body maintain energy and control the ups and downs associated with low blood sugar levels. Many people have great results with <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> helping them control excessive appetite and cravings.</P>


<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MICRO-MINS</H2><P>
Minerals  are  components  of  our  connective  and supportive tissues as well as the hormones and enzymes responsible for our biochemical life. U.S. Senate document 264 stated, "Our physical well-being is more directly dependent upon the minerals we take into our systems than upon calories or vitamins or upon the precise proportion of starch, protein or curbohydrates we consume." Trace minerals are only required in very small amounts, but this does not mean they are less important. A deficiency of any of them can be as serious as any vitamin deficiency.  The 77 plant-derived colloidal minerals contained in <A HREF="mmicro.htm"> MICRO-MINS</A> are absolutely the most complete array of minerals available.<P><P>



<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PROANTHENOLS</H2><P>
 Free radicals damage our cells and cause premature aging, reduced immune function, inflammation and degenerative disease. Our primary defense is the antioxidant nutrients in our diets,  especially  Vitamins  C  and  E. Life  Plus <A HREF="mopc.htm">PROANTHENOLS  BIO-COMPLEX</A>  contain  100% bioavailable, 100% residue-free and standardized OPC's from Dr. Masquelier's patented grape seed and pine bark extract. This great antioxidant product contains a full spectrum of OPC's, plus the valuable bioflavonoids quercetin, rutin, hesperidin, lemon bioflavonoids and vitamin C.  The OPC's are potent antioxidants in their own right, but also increase the effectiveness of others, such as Vitamin C and E contained in <A HREF="mcardio.htm">CARDIO-CHELEX</A> and <A HREF="msupt.htm"> SUPPORT TABS </A> as well.

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> COLODYNE </H2>
<P>The soluble fibers and herbs contained in <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> help cleanse the lower intestine, especially the colon. They help ease conditions resulting from diets too low in fiber. Most leading advisory panels recommend that our diets contain a minimum of thirty grams of fiber per day which is accomplished by one heaping teaspoonful of <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A>. <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> helps to naturally cleanse and correct chronic constipation. This great product contains beneficial bacteria that live in the digestive tract and promotes colon hygiene, manufacture vitamins and helps maintain proper pH and control overgrowth of yeasts. It also absorbs toxins that arise from incomplete digestion or contaminated foods.  Studies show that people with high fiber diets are less likely to develop arteriosclerosis and colon cancer.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUSTENASE</H2>
<P> This great product employs a two phase release method that naturally assists the digestion of the foods we eat. This two phase method assists the stomach (phase I)and in the intestine (phase 2).  It helps to ensure that we receive the nutrients contained in our foods.  Proper digestion reduces stomach stress,  relieves  discomfort  from  overeating  and  aids  in preventing symptoms of improper digestion, such as gas, bloating, burping and heartburn.   In the stomach phase, <A HREF="msust.htm">SUSTENASE</A> helps maintain acid pi-I by supplying Betain HCI which activates the protein digesting enzyme, Pepsin. In its  intestinal  phase,  it  helps  maintain  a  more  alkaline  pH. Complete digestion of proteins is helpful in preventing food allergies. As a component of the SYNERGY PAK it is a basic product that everyone should have at every meal.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE Q-PAK</H2>
<P>The Life Plus maQ-PAK is more than just the basics. The six products that it contains are all important, leading products that provide many benefits. We recommend that you take them every day.<P>
Take 5 CARDIO-CHELEX, 2 MICRO-MINS, and 2 PROANTHENOLS BIO-COMPLEX in the morning with one heaping teaspoonful of  COLODYNE shaken in about 3 oz of your favorite juice.<P>
Take 3 SUPPORT TABS in the mid-afternoon and 1 SUSTENASE digestive aid at the beginning of each meal. 
<P>Each individual is different as far as their nutritional needs. You may change recommendation to better suit   your   needs, but begin with this recommendation. Add more of any of these products or others to your total health program as desired.
