Scientists conducting field work in Alaska are encouraged to visit ASF
prior to a field campaign. It has been our experience that analysis of SAR
data just prior to making field measurements can be very important in 
some cases.

<B>Quality Assurance</B>
</DT>

The STEP provides ASF with an efficient means to provide a level of
quality assurance for ASF products. A certain percentage of ASF-delivered
products are screened for completeness and data quality by personnel from
the Geophysical Institute GeoData Center, which contains historical prints
of AVHRR weather images, Landsat MSS images, USGS topographic maps, and
SAR data. Their assessment is performed in the STEP/IIAS lab utilizing
general software and hardware capabilities.
