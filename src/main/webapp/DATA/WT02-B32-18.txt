This Group is concerned with: (a) fundamental and applied aspects of the
beneficial uses of micro-organisms in food production; and (b) the survival
of pathogenic organisms when exposed to processing stresses
<P>
Current research on food fermentations includes studies of synergistic or
antagonistic interactions in mixed microbial populations, as well as the
relationships between microbes and substrates in a variety of soya, cassava
and rice-based fermented foods. The major objective is to understand and
restrict the growth of pathogenic and/or spoilage organisms, to modify the
taste, texture and nutritional value of selected substrates.
<P>
The influence of lactic acid bacteria, including probiotic species like
<I>Lactobacillus acidophilus </I>and <I>Bifidobacterium bifidum</I>, on the
organoleptic and nutritional properties of cheeses and fermented milks of
Middle Eastern origin is the focus of an additional group of projects.
<P>
The behaviour of food-borne pathogens, such as <I>Escherichia coli</I>,
<I>Listeria </I>and<I> Salmonella </I>, in foods during processing and storage
is examined with a view to understanding the nature of cell injury and repair
at the molecular level, and developing appropriate detection/enumeration
procedures. The impact of environmental influences on the proliferation of
pathogenic organisms and the release of toxins within food systems is also
under investigation.
