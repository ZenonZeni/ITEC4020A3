<h2>Preliminary Statement</h2>
<font size = +1>
<p>1.  During much of this century the mass media,
particularly radio and television, have been characterized by a
limited number of speakers transmitting programming and
information to essentially passive audiences.  The communications
medium of the twenty-first century -- the Internet and
"cyberspace" generally -- is changing that, and will allow
hundreds of millions of individuals to engage in interactive
communication, on a national and global scale never before
possible.  The public square of the past -- with pamphleteering,
soap boxes, and vigorous debate -- is being replaced by the
Internet, which enables average citizens to participate in
national discourse, publish a newspaper, distribute an electronic
pamphlet to the world, and generally communicate to and with a
broader audience than ever before possible.  It also enables
average citizens to gain access to a vast and literally world-
wide range of information, while simultaneously protecting their
privacy, because in this new medium individuals receive only the
communications they affirmatively request.

<p>2.  In enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996
(to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223) (the "Act"), Congress
acknowledged that the Internet represents "an extraordinary
advance in the availability of educational and informational
resources to our citizens," and acknowledged that interactive
computer services "offer users a great degree of control over the
information that they receive."  Congress therefore declared
"[i]t is the policy of the United States . . . to promote the
continued development of the Internet and other interactive
computer services; [and] to preserve the vibrant and competitive
free market that presently exists for the Internet and other
interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State
regulation."  Act &#167; 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230). 
Unfortunately, as we will show, provisions of the Act that were
intended only to protect minors from communications deemed
inappropriate for them will have the effect, perhaps unintended,
of depriving adults of communications that are appropriate, and
indisputably constitutionally protected, for them.  Because of
the way the Internet works, the Act's prohibition of
communications that may be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for minors will effectively ban those same
communications between adults, reducing the adult population in
cyberspace to only what is appropriate for minors.  The banned
speech includes valuable works of literature and art, information
about health and medical issues, and examples of popular culture. 
It also includes robust human discourse about politics, current
events, and personal matters that may at times include harsh,
provocative, or even vulgar language, all of which is
constitutionally protected for adults.

<p>3.  Plaintiffs represent a broad range of individuals
and entities from the computer and communications industries and
the general public who are harmed by the Act.  Plaintiffs include
publishers and creators of content on the Internet; "online
services," "Internet service providers," libraries, and others
who provide access or connection to the Internet; and speakers,
listeners, and users on the Internet.  The Act's effective ban of
a broad category of communication that is constitutionally
protected for adults directly harms the First Amendment rights of
plaintiffs, and of the tens of millions of adult speakers and
listeners who are "online" and linked through this new
communications medium.  Plaintiffs also include parents, who seek
to protect the rights of parents to decide what is appropriate
for their children to receive through interactive computer
communications.

<p>4.  The speech at issue in this case does not include
obscenity, child pornography, harassing speech, speech intended
to entice or lure minors into inappropriate activity, or other
speech that lacks First Amendment protection even for adults. 
This complaint does not challenge governmental regulation of
those categories of non-protected speech, and the relief sought
herein will not affect the government's ability to prosecute the
communication of those categories of speech, all of which are
already prohibited by existing law. 

<p>5.  The most sweeping provision of the Act, Section
502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d)), prohibits the
"display" of material deemed "patently offensive" "in a manner
available to a person under 18 years of age" (emphasis added). 
That provision is subject to certain defenses, which the sponsor
of the Act and Congress apparently believed would enable speakers
to restrict access by minors while simultaneously permitting
access by adults.  But those defenses, which were merely lifted
from the "dial-a-porn" laws, simply do not work in the quite
different medium of cyberspace.  Because of the manner in which
information is stored, transmitted, and received on the Internet,
this provision has the (perhaps unintended) result of banning
speech between adults that is suitable and constitutionally
protected for adults.

<p>6.  The Act is also unconstitutional because there are
alternative ways of protecting minors from material inappropriate
for them that would not abridge the First Amendment rights of
adults, and would be more effective in protecting minors than the
mechanism Congress imposed.  The speaker-based blocking required
by the Act will not protect minors from access to words and
images posted on the Internet abroad by foreign speakers, who are
not effectively subject to prosecution under the Act, or even by
domestic speakers who intentionally or inadvertently violate the
Act.  But user-based blocking technology enables parents and
other users to block or screen whatever words or images they deem
inappropriate, regardless of where posted, at little or no cost. 
For these reasons, every application of the Act unnecessarily and
unconstitutionally abridges the First Amendment rights of adults,
and does so even though there are less drastic alternatives that
would be more protective of minors.
