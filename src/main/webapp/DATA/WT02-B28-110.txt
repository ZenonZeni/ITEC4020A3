<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>About New York Life</STRONG></FONT><P>

When New York Life opened its doors in 1845, Manhattan north of 14th Street was farm country; train
travel was a luxury; Abraham Lincoln was a country lawyer; and land beyond the Mississippi River was
considered the Wild West. We began as a single-product company, with just $18,000 in assets, in a
walk-up office at 57 Wall Street. Our first consideration was to pay all our finanical obligations when they
came due.<P>

It still is. After a century and a half of growth, New York Life now has consolidated assets of over $74
billion and a full range of financial products and services. Through a subsidiary, New York Life
Worldwide Holding, Inc., we have operations in Europe, Asia, and South
America.<P>
We've reached this position through prudent management, a wise investment philosophy, and
innovative product development. Today, New York Life and its affiliates offer much more than life
insurance. We provide individual annuities and an employees' disability income product, as well as an
array of mutual funds and investment products. Group life and health indemnity coverage and managed
care services are offered through a subsidiary, NYLCare.<P>

New York Life also offers its customers a wide variety of retail and institutional investment
opportunities. On the retail side, through the Company's broker/dealer subsidiary, NYLIFE Securities
Inc., customers can invest in the MainStay Family of Mutual Funds. On the institutional side, many
pension managers and plan sponsors have turned to MainStay and stable value products to help their clients
maximize their retirement savings.<P>

But whether it's to protect loved ones from a loss of income due to a breadwinner's death or disability,
or to create wealth for retirement, generations of customers have come to us for their financial needs.
They know New York Life will provide the high quality products and services to help them meet those needs.
That's why we're known as "The Company You Keep."<P>

As an employer, New York Life provides:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Valuable exposure to the exciting financial services industry;
<LI>A stimulating environment in which to expand your capabilities;
<LI>The opportunity to tap your own resources, and to learn from the experience and talents of a wide
range of professionals; 
<LI>A challenging position that lets you make a real contribution to the growth and success of a major
company.
</UL>
New York Life offers opportunities in areas such as accounting, 
actuarial science, asset management, auditing, communications, compliance, customer service, financial management, human resources, information systems, investments, legal, marketing, and mutual funds.
<P>


We seek employees with a wide range of abilities and talent. We have to -- our extensive customer
base and product lines demand it. Your skills will be put to the test as we continue to seek and
capitalize on opportunities within the financial services arena.<P>
We are shaping our Company to keep a step ahead of today's marketplace, without compromising the
service and financial security our customers expect. That means hiring and developing capable men
and women who can provide effective and innovative solutions for the problems people and
businesses face.
