<P ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER><i>on the Edge</I> with BURTON GOLDBERG</CENTER></P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Prevention-You Can <I>See</I> Disease Coming</CENTER></H2>


<p>
        Alternative medicine gives you the opportunity of seeing a disease coming
long before it ever develops. It also allows you to find indicators of disease
at its earliest possible phase and then to take measures to halt its progress.
When you can do this, you're already taking the first step in preventing
illness. 
<p> Alternative medicine has two diagnostic devices that make this 
far-seeing possible. I'm talking about the live-cell microscope and the EAV, a
form of computerized testing based on acupuncture. 
<p>
        In both cases, the doctor can actually see  a disease brewing before it
manifests in the body. You "read" the condition of the patient's live blood
through the microscope and you can study it after  a series of treatments to see
if you're making progress.
<p>
        The letters "EAV" mean Electroacupuncture According to Voll. Reinhold Voll,
M.D., was a German doctor who devised a way to give acupuncture diagnosis a
biofeedback dimension. With EAV, you can test organs and acupuncture points to
see how they will respond to different medications.
<p>
        By taking readings at the different acupuncture points, doctors can tell the
health of the organs and of the body itself. Then by having the patient hold
substances or remedies while the EAV tested the acupuncture points, you can tell
what the patient is reacting to and what might heal them. The EAV computerized
system is a marvelous diagnostic tool.
<p>
        In this way, EAV can be used to detect many disease states, plus the presence
of chemical toxins, food and substance allergies, and imbalances in the body.
More sophisticated devices can formulate and deliver the healing remedy (its
energy equivalent) to the body through the acupuncture meridians.
<p>

        The EAV can give you an enormous amount of information about a person. You
can also use Applied Kinesiology (or muscle testing) for diagnosisóthere are
many roads to Rome. But my point is this: holistic physicians who use this
approach do far better work than those who don't. <p>

        Now,  we all know it's difficult to get people to spend their money, time,
and effort in prevention. But let me tell you, it's worth it. I'm 68 years old.
I have no health problems, no aches or pains, and I feel great, but I'm doing
chelation therapy. Why? Because I know that I have thickened arteries.  I want
to widen my veins, open up their circulation, and I know chelation will do this.
I want to prevent having strokes or heart disease later. <p>

        In heart disease the problem doesn't rear its head until you're 90% gone, so
I had some early testing to find out my condition. I have some occlusions so I'm
doing chelation therapy now, long before it becomes a major problem. That's
prevention. <p>
<A NAME="REAC"> </A>
        Prevention means catching the disease before it develops. But it also means
catching the possibility of an adverse reaction to a drug before you take it.
Consider the DPT vaccine, routinely given to young children. Pertussin is a
dangerous substance for a lot of children; too many children have a bad reaction
to this vaccine and some experience permanent damage. It doesn't have to be this
way. <p>

        This is what I did with my own son working with Harold Whitcomb, M.D.,  in
Aspen, Colorado. First, Dr. Whitcomb tested him with the EAV. The DPT shot at
full-strength would have blown my son away, so Dr. Whitcomb gave him half the
dose. You can reduce the side-effects of the vaccine by reducing the dose to
what the child can accept. Second, you use homeopathics to remove the vaccine
residue. <p>

        The funny thing is I wasn't always sold on the EAV device. Twelve years ago
Joseph McGovern, M.D., had to retire from Harvard University  because he had
environmental illness and was allergic to a huge list of chemicals. When I first
visited a clinic that used the EAV, I laughed. I thought it was quackery. But
when I told McGovern about it, he taught me something important. <p>

        "Don't laugh," he said. "The EAV cured one of my failures, a farmer with
pesticide poisoning. How was I to know what poisons were inside this man dying
in the hospital? This device saved his life because it identified the toxins;
then it indicated the homeopathics that would remove the toxins from his body."

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>You don't have to fly blind anymore when it comes to prevention.
 <BR>You can catch the disease before it ever makes you sick. That's prevention.</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>
        About 85,000 practitioners worldwide use computerized testing for diagnosis.
Unfortunately, it's not yet widely respected in the U.S.  A lot of holistic
physicians don't know about it or are fearful of the political reprisals if they
use it.  At present, the FDA allows physicians to use this on an experimental
basis solely for screening purposes. Depending on what state you live in, there
is a more supportive or less favorable attitude about this approach. <p>

        But as I see it, anybody who doesn't use this is flying blind. EAV is the
leading edge and it will be proven down the line that you can do miraculous
things with it. Persuading people to take this opportunity is what my life is
all about. As the Zen Master says, "In the beginner's mind, there are many
possibilities; in the expert's mind, there are few." Let's keep medicine an open
field of possibilities. <p>

        You don't have to fly blind anymore when it comes to prevention. You can
know from your instruments that you're on course. I'm devoting my life to
educating the public that they're getting poisoned to death, to explaining how
to detoxify themselves,  and to show them that there are powerful, effective
ways to get better. You can catch the disease before it ever makes you sick.
That's prevention.  And that's an alternative worth living for. <p>
