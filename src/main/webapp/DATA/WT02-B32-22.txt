The multidisciplinary research programme is aimed at understanding specific
aspects of the complex relationships which exist between food and consumer.
Emphasis is placed on investigating the perceptual attributes of foods which
determine consumer choice behaviour and on the physico-chemical properties of
foods that are responsible, at least in part, for the sensory characteristics
perceived.  The consequences of food intake, including nutritional benefit and
wholesomeness from both a microbiological and toxicological perspective is
studied.

<h3>Food Acceptance Psychology</h3>
The object is to investigate the determinants of consumer food choice behaviour
by (i) identifying the principal context of use of a particular food and then
determining the combination of product attributes and sensory characteristics
that render it appropriate for use in thesse specific contexts.  This involves
the development of specialised psychological methods and mathematical modelling
procedures.  In this respect, present research concentrates on the application
of the repertory grid method for eliciting descriptions from consumers of
product-use contexts and attributes, on weighted hierachical modelling of
product attributes within contexts to predict brand product choices, and, as an
adjunct to this, on the applications of behaviourally relevant criteria for
segmenting consumer populations. Sensory characteristics are primarily
responsible for the pleasure derived from food at the point of consumption and
hence are heavily implicated in food choice.  For this reason, research is also
focussed on the development and refinement of appropriate sensory methodology
and its application to food systems relevant to the overall research
programme.
<p>
<h3>Physico-chemical determinants of sensory quality</h3>
Since the sensory characteristics perceived when a food is consumed depend on
both food and consumer, physico-chemical investigation of the determinants of
sensory quality forms an intrinsic part of the food quality research programme.
In heated foods the main flavour-forming reactions are the Maillard reaction
between reducing sugars and amino compounds, and the thermal degradation of
lipids.  These reactions follow complex pathways, producing volatile and
non-volatile reactive intermediates.  Thus an important aspect of the current
research programme involves investigation of the sensory characteristics of
aromas produced by the interaction of lipids with Maillard reaction products in
selected model systems resembling fatty foods.  The formation of colorants in
such systems is being studied in parallel.  Attention is also focussed on the
physico-chemical properties of molecules which confer taste characteristics,
particularly sweetness. Many recent studies have shown that textural
characteristics are important determinants of sensory quality.  Since complex
relationships exist between the rheological propertites of foods and perceived
texture, a new multidimensional approach has been implemented to study them.
<p><h3>
</h3><b>Wholesomeness and Safety</b><p>
This research programme aims to promote wholesomeness and safety in foods
through microbiological and toxicological control, through improving the
nutritional quality of the diet, through consumer education, and through food
law. Microbiological research into the survival of food pathogens during
processing stress, seeks to understand the nature of injury and repair at the
molecular level and develope appropriate isolation procedures.  Research is
also directed towards environmental influences on the proliferation of
pathogenic organisms and the production of toxins in food systems.
Toxicological research is aimed at the detection and quantification of
pesticide, herbicide and packaging residues in foods.  Social nutrition
research concentrates on developing procedures for determining the level of
consumers' nutritional knowledge and, from this, deriving specially tailored
and targetted educational messages. Biochemical work aims to identify
particular foods that could improve the nutritional quality of the diet.
Special emphasis is placed on the influence of legumes (particularly baked
beans) in lowering blood cholesterol levels.  Research is also being undertaken
on the formulation, implementation and influence of food law in the UK and
EC.
