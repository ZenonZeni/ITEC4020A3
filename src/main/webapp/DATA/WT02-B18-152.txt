<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>CytRx <B>Investor Conference Call Synopsis
</B></FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>August 27, 1996</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Jack J. Luchese, President and CEO</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Good morning.  For those of you who are new to CytRx,
our mission is to develop and market high value human pharmaceutical
products. Our lead product is RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>, a
compound that shows promise in a variety of vaso-occlusive disorders.
 We plan to begin advanced human clinical trials in sickle cell
anemia patients during the first quarter of 1997. <B>RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I></B>
 is a purified version of RheothRx that we originally licensed
to Burroughs Wellcome (now Glaxo Wellcome).  Earlier this year
we regained all rights to the product and have purified and improved
it.  Recently, we were awarded a “composition of matter”
patent on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>  which provides us long
patent protection in the market place. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A lot of activity is taking place on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>.
 We have met with the FDA on our proposed program. They were very
supportive and we have since sent them a development proposal
and we expect them to respond in the next several weeks. We have
a clinical  investigator meeting planned for later this year.
We have raw material being produced and will soon be manufacturing
clinical supplies to have them ready to go by 1997.  In addition
we are beginning a number of pre-clinical studies to support the
sickle cell clinical activity as well as other future indications.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><I><B>We are excited about RheothRx and are looking forward
to beginning advanced clinical<BR> trials next year<FONT SIZE=2>.</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Sickle cell is an attractive initial target market
for CytRx.  Its global market size has been estimated to be between
$25 - $100 million. There is a very clear medical need.  Sickle
cell patients are subject to very painful crises.  On average,
patients require hospitalization about two times a year.  It's
a very expensive treatment with painful crisis costing about $6,000
per hospital stay and treatment cycle. It is also very damaging
to the patients organ systems which is why, on average, their
life expectancy is about 20 to 25 years shorter than otherwise
healthy people.  It is a debilitating disease for which there
is no real treatment.  We expect RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
to be the first treatment for the episode of the crisis itself.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is important to note that already we have one
efficacy study that has been completed with very good results.
This is why we are encouraged to do additional studies in sickle
cell anemia.  Our future plans for RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
 are to expand the clinical program beyond sickle cell and move
into much larger indications that are much more attractive in
general.  We would also like to partner this product on an international
basis. So we are excited about RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> and
are looking forward to beginning advanced human clinical trials
next year. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><I><B>It is our plan to take each subsidiary public.</B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At this point I would like to talk about our subsidiaries.
 As you know, CytRx has a unique structure.  We are a human pharmaceutical
company but also have three wholly-owned subsidiaries. The reason
for these subsidiaries is that we have a great deal of technology
that didn't totally fit into our human strategy.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We felt it was appropriate to bring in people that
were experts in these areas and build companies around these technologies.
 Vetlife is an animal health products company, Vaxcel is a vaccine
delivery company and Proceutics is a pharmaceutical services company.
 I'll speak to each one separately.
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Vetlife's</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> mission is to
improve the productivity of food animals for human consumption.
 They have a very interesting business plan in that they have
both short and long term opportunities. Beginning in January 1997,
Vetlife will be marketing a line of cattle growth implants.  These
products are, for the most part, already approved as Vetlife has
taken the distribution rights away from Upjohn.  The cattle growth
implant market is centered on the feedlot with approximately $100
million in annual sales.  We estimate 1997 Vetlife sales to be
in the $8 - $10 million range which will generate $1 - $2 million
in profits.  So I think it's particularly interesting that we
have a company that will be showing sales <U>and</U> profit next
year.  Also, Vetlife has licensed CytRx technologies for animal
health use.  They have several opportunities in the area of feed
efficiency for growth promotion in poultry and swine.  They also
have technology for vaccine adjuvants and anti-infective technology
for animal health use.  These are longer term opportunities. Vetlife
management's plan is to develop these to a point where corporate
partners will be interested, then license them in return for license
fees, milestone payments and future royalties on sales.  So, Vetlife
looks like a very attractive opportunity for 1997 and beyond.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is our plan to take each subsidiary public at
some point in time. They were set up as wholly-owned subsidiaries
with the intent in mind of taking them public.  And each one of
these subsidiaries is led by management that really understands
their business. In the case of Vetlife, Rich Shuler was the former
Vice President of the Syntex animal health division. He's a very
seasoned and savvy executive. He has been in the animal health
business his entire career, and we have the utmost confidence
in his ability to run this business. He will also do a very great
job in launching an IPO for this company.
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Vaxcel</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> is our second subsidiary.
This is a vaccine delivery company with a focused and simple business
strategy. Vaxcel has a technology that enhances the effectiveness
of vaccines. They plan to provide this technology to vaccine producers
to improve their vaccines -- whether they be new or old vaccines.
They are currently in a Phase I human clinical safety study which
should be complete by year-end. This a key study because most
potential licensing partners want to make sure that Vaxcel's
adjuvant material is safe, and so far the study is meeting expectations.
They already have two option agreements, one with Medeva (a UK
company) and Connaught. Additionally, they have a license agreement
with Corixa which is a biopharmaceutical start-up company working
on cancer vaccines.  Vaxcel management is in discussions with
just about every major vaccine player, so we expect more licenses
to come based on the performance of this technology.  Just like
Vetlife, Vaxcel will be planning an IPO and we hope that some
time in 1997 or 1998 that those IPO's will take place. Vaxcel
is headed by Paul Wilson who is the former Vice President and
general manager of American<B> </B>Cyanamid's<B> </B>Lederle-Praxis
vaccine division.  Paul's business skills are complemented
by Dr. Mark Newman who is one of the leading scientists in the
area of adjuvant technology.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Finally, our newest subsidiary is <B>Proceutics</B>,
which began operations this past January.  Proceutics provides
pre-clinical pharmaceutical development services such as analytical
chemistry, chemical synthesis and formulations.  These services
are useful to large pharmaceutical companies looking to outsource
projects during peak work periods or downsizing situations, generic
companies planning to file ANDA's and small development
companies that do not have the capital to hire the people and
build the facilities to do the technical work required to develop
drugs. Proceutics is enjoying increasing sales revenue each quarter
and is now seeing a consistent level of repeat business, which
is where your measure really is.  They are looking forward to
a profitable 1997 with revenues in the $3 - $4 million range vs.
revenues of about $2 - $2 1/2 million this year.  So Proceutics
is on the right track.  It is currently our intention for Proceutics
to go public sometime in 1998. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>When these milestones have been achieved, CytRx will
enjoy having three publicly-traded subsidiaries with CytRx owning
a substantial equity stake in each one.  This will provide a great
deal of flexibility in raising additional cash if needed, and
also in doing future mergers and acquisitions to build our core
human therapeutic business. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<CENTER><I><B>We have about a $2 million value being placed on
our businesses and technologies<BR> which is extremely low.</B></I></CENTER>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Just to give you a brief financial picture, CytRx
and its subsidiaries have cash of approximately $21 million, and
physical assets of $8 million. We have no debt, so we have a net
asset value of about $29 million. Compare that with our current
market capitalization which stands at around $31 million (7.8
million shares outstanding at about $4 per share).  We therefore
have about a $2 million value being placed on our businesses and
technologies which is extremely low.  As far as our operating
performance goes, 1995 total revenues were $2.25 million, we estimate
 $4 - $5 million for 1996, and looking toward 1997 we are projecting
around $13 - $18 million largely due to the January 1997 launch
of Vetlife's cattle implant line.  Our cash burn for 1995
was about $10 million. This will be reduced in 1996 to $4 - $5
million and looking toward 1997 we are looking at $3 million -
and possibly break even.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>-------------------------------------------------------------</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>“Q &amp; A” SESSION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. <B>Please tell us more about the new and improved
RheothRx.<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> is a purified version
of the commercial grade of RheothRx that was used in earlier clinical
trials.  What was seen in the earlier trials was that in very
high doses in certain patients (over 75 years old with a history
of kidney dysfunction) there were reports of elevated levels of
creatinine which is a marker of kidney function - indicating
a potential problem.  When dosage levels were reduced, the commercial
grade RheothRx did not demonstrate sufficient efficacy.  That
is why Glaxo Wellcome discontinued the trials and returned full
rights to us.  Our scientists analyzed the problem and found minute
quantities of an impurity in the commercial grade compound.  We
felt that if we took this impurity out we could have greater dosing
flexibility.  We then developed chemistry methods to extract it.
 We are confident that purified RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> will
allow us to dose at required levels without incurring this kidney
concern seen with the commercial compound.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. <B>Will you develop this on your own or are
you going to look for a partner?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. Our current plan is to take RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
into the clinic on our own and get it approved for sickle cell
crisis.  We believe this is the fastest way to get it approved
in the United States. At the same time we will be talking with
corporate partners to develop and commercialize larger indications
such as heart attack and stroke.  Our plan is to market RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
directly to the sickle cell community which is a very concentrated
market. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. What do you think the cost will be<B> to bring
this product through the trials?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. We estimate development costs to be between $6
- $8 million.  I am very comfortable with the fact that we have
enough cash to do that.  Our business is financially under control
and our subsidiaries are no longer requiring the cash investment
that they have in the past so we are comfortable making this investment.
 I also hope that as we develop RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>,
we will establish corporate partner relationships that will generate
license fees and milestone payments to offset and perhaps exceed
the development cost for the sickle cell claim.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. In terms of clinical trials does that refer
to <B>Phase II or Phase III?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A.  Getting a drug approved requires several phases
of human clinical trails. Phase I trials are to establish drug
safety. Phase II is for dose ranging in patients with the disease
to determine optimal dosing.  Phase III is the pivotal clinical
study and is what approval is based on.  Given the excellent results
of a Phase II trial concluded in 1995, our plans are to convince
the FDA to allow us to directly proceed with a Phase III pivotal
trial in 1997 which would put us on track to file an NDA sometime
in 1999.  We are anxious to get going on this.  There is a great
deal of data compiled on this drug, and we are pursuing an Orphan
Drug indication for a disease that has no effective therapy. We
are currently planning a trial that will take about a year and
a half to complete. It really depends on the final discussions
with the FDA, on how many sites are involved and on the enrollment
rate at the sites.  But, if all goes according to plan, we will
finish the study in mid-1998.  Then, assuming the study achieves
everything we want, we will begin preparing our NDA for submission.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. Does the orphan drug status designation that
was given to you by the FDA <B>help?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. Yes, the orphan drug designation puts us in the
FDA's “1-A” priority category.  The FDA is
required by law to give it a fast review which doesn't mean it's
going to get a fast approval.  But, if your NDA is prepared properly,
the data is well supported and they quickly review it -- this
should lead to faster approval which is generally the case with
orphan drugs.  You also get some tax advantages that are not as
important to us and you also get seven years market exclusivity
which frankly we don't need because it overlaps our patents. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. <B>What is your confidence level after your
talks with the FDA?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. We had one good meeting with the FDA.  They were
receptive to us taking RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> back into
the clinic for sickle cell.  It was a very constructive meeting,
and was encouraging for me. They made some comments and suggestions
and we have just recently communicated back to them with precisely
what we'd like to do. It will be several weeks before they respond.
That's just the nature of the agency.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q.<B> From your dialogue do you have a pretty
good confidence level they will allow you to use previous data,
you're not going to have to start from ground zero?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. We have no indication so far that leads us to
believe that this is going to be treated as a new compound.  In
fact, that was the main purpose of the first meeting - to have
a good understanding between CytRx an the FDA that this is not
a new compound. One of the consultants we worked with had a great
quotation. He said “it's better, not different.”
 In this business, pharmaceutical companies are always purifying
their compounds all the way until they get to Phase III, so this
would not be an unusual situation where you remove an impurity
before you go into a Phase III trial. That is precisely what we
have done. We haven't changed the structure of the compound. 
When you characterize it, it has the same profile as the other
one except we've eliminated impurities that we've determined provide
no benefit, and in fact, appear to cause a problem at very high
doses.  By eliminating the impurities, we improve the compound,
and make it “better, not different.”<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. <B>What leads you to feel it is better?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. What makes it better is that it's a more purified
compound that we believe we can dose at higher levels without
running into the same level of renal dysfunction we saw in the
earlier trial.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We did a study in a very carefully controlled rat
model that took us months and months to do. We tested three groups.
 One was the commercial grade of RheothRx, the second was the
purified version, and the third is what we called the extract
-- what we removed in the purification process.  The rats in this
study had only about <U>one-sixth</U> of their normal kidney function
to begin with and then they were given <U>five</U> times the clinical
dose.  The purpose of this study was to see how a severely compromised
kidney would react to a high dosage of RheothRx.  As you can see,
the study was intentionally designed to find problems.  What we
found is that the commercial grade group had a very high mortality
rate and the purified group had a very low mortality rate. Since
the extract amount is so small, the extract group was actually
given a “special” mixture that contained approximately
ten times the normal level of impurities.  This group had about
an 82% mortality and the feeling was that if we gave them the
pure extract we would have killed all the animals within an hour.
 So we're very confident that we've removed the problem.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. If all your dreams were to come true where
would we be at this time next year?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. By this time next year I would like to see RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>
well into an acute sickle cell crisis human clinical trial. I
would like to have initiated a study in acute chest syndrome as
well. I would like to see two excellent sales quarters from Vetlife
that will firmly establish its value to our shareholders.  I would
also like to see two corporate deals completed by Vaxcel and Proceutics
turning a profit.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. How about you<B>r stock buy-back program?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. We did not do a lot of buying in the first and
second quarter.  Since we have not made a disclosure, all I can
tell you today is that we have clearly been more active in the
third quarter.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. You mentioned that Vaxcel has been talking
with many major vaccine companies.  Are any
negotiations going on with CytRx or other subsidiaries?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. There are, but I can't discuss those until they
are concluded.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. What would be the earliest that the first subsidiary
could be brought public, and how much of the subsidiary would
you sell?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. I'll answer the second question first.  I would
like to limit our equity sales to no more than 20% of each company.
 We haven't decided which will be first.  That will depend on
market conditions and subsidiary achievements.  I would like to
see one company go public around mid-1997 if the market is cooperative.
 I think Vaxcel or Vetlife will be the best candidates. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q.<B>  Where would you like CytRx stock to be
when you take a subsidiary public?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. I would like CytRx with a market cap of no less
than a $100 million which is about $13 a share. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. What catalysts <B>do you think are necessary
to take it there?<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. I think getting RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> back
into the clinic will be key.  Most people have totally discounted
RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>, and, once it's back in human clinical
trials, people will start paying a lot of attention to it.  I
also think a greater awareness of the value of our subsidiaries
is another important element.  Seeing substantial first quarter
sales by Vetlife and licensing deals by Vaxcel should get people
to take notice and start paying attention to these as truly valuable
subsidiaries.  Then, we have to do an excellent job simply communicating
our story and getting in front of people so they can fully understand
it. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Q. How about Protox?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<FONT SIZE=2>A. Given the emphasis we are placing on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>,
we have de-emphasized our activities in Protox.  The FDA has given
us the go ahead to commence Phase I trials but at this point we
are concentrating all our energy and people and financial resources
on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> which is where the most opportunity
is for our shareholders. It's a focus issue, pure and simple.
 It takes a lot of time and energy to move a drug through its
development.  Right now, I want to focus totally on RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>.
That's where we can get the biggest bang for our buck.</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=2>------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>I would like to point out that today we have made
several “forward looking” statements.  Please keep
in mind all these depend on many factors such as FDA reviews that
we do not control. What we plan to do is one thing and how the
regulatory agencies react is sometimes another.  Also there are
the obvious risks from trial outcomes -- but in this business
we take risks.  What we plan to do is manage well that which we
can manage and be prepared to act decisively when necessary.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>So with that, I thank you for calling in.</FONT>
