<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Spoken Language Problems</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>May, 1995</b> </p>

<p>The development of spoken/oral language normally occurs without formal
teaching. It develops as a result of exposure to spoken language. Problems
with language development may not be recognized for a long time unless
the child simply fails to begin talking. Oral language is the basis for
learning reading and written language and for benefitting from instruction
in other areas. It is important to identify children whose language is
not developing normally so that more specific stimulation and actual intervention
can begin as early as possible. </p>

<p>Language problems, like other learning disabilities, are called by several
different names including: delayed language, language disorder, language
disability, specific language disability, etc. Some people distinguish
between children who appear to be developing all aspects of language at
a slower rate (delayed language) and those who do not appear to be developing
language in the expected way or have uneven language development (language
disability). Regardless of the label, language problems should be assessed.
A language evaluation must include a hearing test since hearing loss is
one reason for delayed language acquisition. Speech-Language Pathologists
typically do the testing for spoken language disabilities. When children
are of school age, the evaluation must include the language of instruction
and reading and written language. </p>

<p>Like other types of learning disabilities, language disabilities differ
in type and severity. In young children there are many known milestones
that can be observed by parents and preschool teachers. Some of these are
listed on the table below along with some activities to encourage language
development. </p>

<p>Even mild problems in spoken language can have an impact on learning
in school. A child should enter first grade with the majority of the language
needed for learning. Problems in understanding language will affect almost
every aspect of school: following directions, learning vocabulary, understanding
instruction, reading comprehension, etc. Problems in using language are
often seen in children who do not understand. Some children understand
spoken language but have difficulty expressing themselves. A common problem
seen in expressive language is difficulty recalling words they know (word
retrieval problems). These children understand the word, know it when they
hear it, but cannot always call it up when they need it. These children
may say, &quot;You know that thing you sweep the floor with&quot;; &quot;I
know it, but I can't think of the word&quot;; &quot;Umm, umm, I forget&quot;;
etc. Retrieval problems can make children unwilling to participate in class
because they interfere with a child's demonstration of what he/she has
learned. For example, children may have learned color or letter names,
but are unable to give the names when asked. These children can point to
the color or letter when the name is said to them. </p>

<p>Some children have difficulty with spoken grammar. They omit words or
word endings or get words in the wrong order. Some have difficulty putting
their ideas into words in an organized way. </p>

<p>Problems in pronunciation of words can be the result of mishearing sounds
(Starvation Army/Salvation Army), getting sounds in the wrong order (aminal/animal),
or difficulty producing specific sounds (fum/thumb). Problems with the
sound system of language have been reported in many children who have difficulty
learning to read. While some speech sounds are acquired later than others,
children who have many sounds they cannot make and are difficult to understand
may have later problems with phonics. </p>

<p>Language activities with young children are fun for them and can stimulate
more language. Reading to children and talking about the pictures and the
&quot;story&quot; is an important activity. Making certain new vocabulary
is used in many ways and in different situations helps children learn new
words. </p>

<p>It is important to have children's language evaluated if there is any
concern. Too often, parents are told &quot;He'll outgrow it&quot; or &quot;Just
wait, she'll talk when she's ready&quot;. This is not good advice when
the child is not doing what is expected for his/her age. Speech-Language
Pathologists can determine what the problem is, if any, and make recommendations
for working with the child. Oral language is important for social development
and effective communication, as well as being the foundation for school
learning. Problems should not be overlooked or disregarded.
