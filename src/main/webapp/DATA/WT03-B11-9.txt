Aspen Developing
New Electrocatalysts

Aspen Systems Inc. (184 Cedar Hill St., Marlborough, MA 01752-3017;
Tel: 508/481-5058) has been awarded a $74,998 Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 grant from the Department of
Energy (DOE) for the development of low-cost, contamination-
tolerant electrocatalysts for low-temperature fuel cells.  Aspens
Kang P. Lee says that power generation from fuel cells via reformed
gaseous fuel or direct methanol oxidation is a very attractive
option for fuel-cell vehicles or other mobile systems.  One of the
major problems with the technology, though, is the high cost and
limited supply of noble metal-based catalysts.  Such catalysts are
prone to carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide poisoning.

Metal carbides, such as molybdenum carbide and tungsten carbide,
exhibit high catalytic activity toward the electro-oxidation of
methanol.  Such catalysts are also tolerant of carbon monoxide
contamination in the reaction zone.  The problem is that it is very
difficult to manufacture these materials with high surface areas.
Expensive high-temperature reduction and carbonization techniques
or high-energy processes such as ion implantation are used to
prepare high surface area metal carbides.

The Aspen approach is to manufacture Group VI metal carbides using
nonconventional, proprietary surfactants in a chemical reduction
process.  Methods for controlling the composition, morphology, and
particle size of the materials will be developed with the Phase 1
SBIR grant.  The products will then be evaluated with respect to
surface area, particle size, particle morphology, size
distribution, composition, crystallinity, the presence of impurity
phases, and localized electronic energy levels at the surface.
Their electrocatalytic activity of these nanoscale metal carbides
will be investigated for their effect on hydrogen and methanol
oxidation.

Grant Funds a
Catalyst/Collector

An integrated catalyst/collector structure for regenerative proton-
exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells is the subject of a $75,000
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 grant from the
Department of Energy (DOE) to Giner Inc. (14 Spring St., Waltham,
MA 02154-4497; Tel: 617/899-7270).

Tony LaConti says that dedicated PEM fuel cells, electrolyzers, and
regenerative fuel cells offer benefits to the electric vehicle (EV)
industry and energy-storage programs.  The Giner researchers will
construct a new gas-diffusion electrode/current collection
interface (GCI) structure that they believe will yield superior
performance, stability, and simplicity at the positive electrode of
PEM electrochemical cells.

The Giner structure is based on a stabilized, proprietary metal
sinter that provides PEM fuel cell catalytic activity and
facilitates bulk fluid distribution.  LaConti anticipates improved
bifunctional performance at the positive electrode and similar
construction of both the GCI and bipolar plate, leading to reduced
complexity of the system and increased feasibility of single-unit
PEM regenerative fuel cells.

The GCI structure should be applicable to dedicated fuel cells and
electrolyzers, providing improved performance, simplicity, and
reliability.  Electrolyzers could supply high-pressure hydrogen to
hydrogen-air PEM fuel cells.  PEM regenerative fuel-cell
applications could be particularly important in the future
development of energy storage or load leveling based on solar
energy photovoltaic conversion systems and other advanced low-cost
energy concepts, e.g. wind power.

Improved Molten
Carbonate Matrix

A process discovered by Katsumi Suzuki and a team of scientists at
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. (Research Institute,
Fuel Cell Development Dept., 301-15 Toyosu, Koto-ku, Tokyo 135,
Japan) is used to fabricate a porous matrix. The matrix consists of
a thin-plate of lithium aluminate impregnated with alkali
carbonate.  It supports the liquid electrolyte in molten carbonate
fuel cells (MCFC), which need high efficiency and minimal
environmental pollution for in-city electric power generation.

Since mechanical integrity and chemical stability of the porous
electrolyte plate (matrix) affect the reliability and life of the
MCFC, Suzuki and his colleagues have applied the concept of fiber
reinforcements to the plate.  The application comes in the form of
lithium aluminate fibers composed of single rather than
polycrystals.  The single crystals yield more thermally stable
fibers with a high degree of chemical compatibility with molten
carbonate.  Adding the fibers to the electrolyte plate improves
thermal cycle resistance.  All of these characteristics make the
fibers more effective under MCFC operating conditions.

After considering various starting materials and synthesis methods
for the lithium aluminate fibers, the scientists settled on lithium
hydroxide and alumina hydroxide.  Since the effect of a third
component, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, was
unclear, it was eliminated. Additionally, they decided to develop
a new fabrication method based on the low-temperature chemical
reactions in aqueous solutions rather than the reaction
temperatures higher than 400oC commonly used.

In the Materials Research Society's Advances in Porous Materials
[371, 297-302, 1995], Suzuki's team described how it prepared an
aqueous slurry that contained 0.6% mole of lithium hydroxide and
0.6% mole of alumina hydroxide.  The slurry was heated at 50oC for
one hour, and then the temperature was raised to 95oC-99oC under
controlled conditions for about 200 hours, in order to evaporate
water from the slurry.  This process yielded a straight beta-
lithium aluminate fiber with a diameter of one micron and a length
of 10 to 15 microns.   An intermediate phase (about 25 hours into
the evaporation process) produces a complex hydroxide
[LiOH2Al(OH)3nH2)].

Sukuzi believes that the dehydration reaction proceeds between the
complex hydroxide the lithium hydroxide.  They found the formation
of the beta-lithium aluminate to be dependent on the water-
evaporation condition.  Additionally, by varying the molar ratio of
the starting materials, at low water evaporation rates, the
research team found varying levels of the complex hydroxide
present, even though the morphology of the fiber stayed basically
the same.

It was discovered that using a two-stage water-evaporation process
controlled crystal growth and changed the fiber's morphology.  The
second stage involved cooling the slurry to room temperature and
holding it for 24 hours, once half of the residual water in it was
evaporated.  This reaction produced a beta-lithium aluminate with
a larger diameter (3 microns) and longer length (30 microns) than
the original fiber.  The researchers surmised that the reaction
between the lithium hydroxide and the complex hydroxide caused the
original fiber to form the nucleus of the larger fiber.

Based on the knowledge that high temperatures (above 700oC) causes
beta-lithium aluminate to transform to gamma-lithium aluminate,
Suzuki et al experimented with temperatures ranging from 650oC to
950oC, in order to promote transformation.  They observed a
transformation at 800oC in 30 minutes and at 900oC in two minutes.
At both these temperatures, the gamma-lithium aluminate kept the
same fiber geometry as the beta-lithium aluminate.

To evaluate the effect that the gamma-lithium aluminate fiber
reinforcements had on the MCFC electrolyte plate's performance,
Suzuki et al added 10% of the fiber to an ordinary gamma-lithium
aluminate powder and dispersed the mixture in an organic solvent.
This solution formed the basis of a slurry for tape casting and
fabricating the electrolyte plate via the doctor blade method.

They tested 20 heat and cooling cycles, at temperatures ranging
from 350oC to 650oC, on a 10 cm square single cell that contained
the fiber-reinforced electrolyte plate.  Test conditions included
an average cell voltage of 0.75 V and a current density of 150
mA/cm2, levels that matched a comparable cell without the fiber-
reinforced electrolyte plate. The research team noted no
significant gas cross-leakage during the cell testing for the
gamma-lithium aluminate-reinforced plate, while the ordinary plate
exhibit a 5% gas cross-leakage half way through the test cycles.
The fibers retained their original form and remained stable with
alkali carbonates and under MCFC test conditions.

Grant for Modeling
Molten Carbonate

Joseph D Fehribach, a researcher at Worcester Polytechnic Institute
(100 Institute Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2247; Tel: 617/793-5000)
has received a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant to
create mathematical models of molten carbonate fuel cells.
Fehribach says that the models used to describe molten carbonate
fuel cells are generally deficient in certain aspects. The aim of
the research is to develop and study improved mathematical models
for electrochemical fuel cells, particularly molten carbonate fuel
cells.

Fehribach added that these microscale potential models will be
analyzed numerically and analytically to determine what results can
be achieved on this small scale. The equations will be used to
derive consistent models in terms of species concentration. Both
types of models will be averaged to obtain macroscale models that
can be fit to experimental data.

A number of different averaging techniques will be considered in
formulating three-phase homogenized models to obtain a broad
prospective on the relationship between the microscale and the
macroscale. An important part of the work will be addressing
questions of interest to the fuel-cell research community and
comparing the models to experimental results.

Alliant's Product
First on Jupiter

High-power D-size lithium-sulfur dioxide batteries designed and
produced by Alliant Techsystems (5901 Lincoln Drive, Edina, MN
5536; Tel: 612/931-5413, Fax: 612/931-5423) recently provided power
for NASA's Galileo entry probe during its dramatic and apparently
successful descent into Jupiter's atmosphere.  The probe relayed
data and digitally stored photographs prior to its on-schedule
destruction deep in Jupiter's high-pressure atmosphere.

The probe was the first man-made object to enter the atmosphere of
an outer planet and although they were eventually destroyed along
with the probe, the Alliant batteries were the first batteries on
Jupiter.  The probe was designed and built by Hughes Space and
Communications Co., and was launched six years ago aboard the Space
Shuttle Atlantis.

According to Rod Bitz, director of corporate communications, the
specially space-qualified D-sized batteries are durable enough to
withstand the severe acceleration, vibration, and G forces the
Galileo probe encountered as it enters the Jovian atmosphere.  The
batteries underwent thorough pre-launch shelf-life and
qualification programs, special engineering tests, and have been
tested regularly throughout the six-year journey to Jupiter.

In 1997, Alliant's lithium batteries again will provide power for
a deep-space probe when the Cassini Saturn mission is launched on
an 11-year journey.  The spacecraft will release the Huygens probe
to inspect Titan, a satellite of Saturn and the only moon in the
solar system known to have an atmosphere.  Additional missions to
the outer planets, including Neptune and Pluto, are under
consideration.

Oak Ridge Design Is
Licensed to Teledyne

Doctors who rely on tests that monitor the brain activity of their
patients could benefit from a new battery developed at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (Oak Ridge, TN 37830-6030) and licensed to
Teledyne Electronic Technologies (TET).  The thin-film, solid-
state, rechargeable lithium battery may be used to amplify brain
impulses recorded during an electroencephalogram (EEG) procedure.


At present,  EEGs rely on sensors to detect the extremely low-level
electric signals coming from the body.  The signals are then
relayed through wires to an amplification device.  ORNL reports
that the new batteries may be used in performing electrocardiogram
(EKG) procedures and in other medical diagnostic tools.  Other
likely applications include portable communications devices, where
the devices could be integrated into the circuits; power sources
for personal hazardous gas sensors and micromachines; and backup
power sources for SRAM and DRAM memory.

The new battery, says John Bates (Tel: 423/574-6280, Fax: 423/574-
4143, E-mail: job@ornl.gov) of ORNL, offers many useful features,
particularly in applications requiring small size.  The ORNL device
is only 10 micrometers thick, can be manufactured in a variety of
shapes, and may be applied to virtually any solid substrate, such
as silicon, alumina, glass, and plastics.  When mounted on plastic
substrates, the batteries are quite flexible.

Experimental cells typically have areas of 0.5-2.0 cm2, but Bates
says that there is no fundamental limit the on areal dimensions.
The batteries have high energy densities, can be charged thousands
of times, and have a long shelf life with no measurable change
after one year of storage.  A wide operating temperature range is
another advantage of the devices; cycle testing at ORNL has been
performed between -20oC and +100oC.

The components of the new thin-film battery, including vanadium,
platinum, or nickel current collectors; a cathode; an electrolyte;
a lithium anode; and a multilayer parylene/metal protective
coating, are deposited on a substrate using standard sputtering or
evaporation techniques.  The performance characteristics of the
battery are determined by the type of cathode material, its area
and thickness, and the operating temperature.  The cathode
material, such as crystalline LiCoO2 or amorphous or crystalline
LiMn2O4 or V2O5, and the deposition and processing methods used to
prepare the cathode film determine the operating voltage range,
capacity, specific power, and specific energy.

Batteries with crystalline LiCoO2 cathodes, deposited by sputtering
and then annealed in oxygen at 600oC-700oC, have high discharge
rates with good cathode utilization and small capacity loss with
cycling.  Their disadvantage is the high annealing temperature
required to form the crystalline phase.  Crystalline LiMn2O4
cathodes are deposited by electron-beam evaporation or sputtering
and then annealed at 700oC-800oC.  They feature high discharge rates
of up to several milliamps per square centimeter (mA/cm2) at 25oC,
but also must be annealed to achieve the crystalline form.

Because the batteries are rechargeable, it is not necessary to
supply the power and energy required by a single duty cycle, i.e.
the conditions of current and operating time required by a device
before recharge can occur.  This means that the applications for
which recharging is an option, the batteries can be much smaller
than primary, or nonrechargable, cells designed for the same
application.  The device, which contains fewer toxic materials than
most other batteries, is the focus of a cooperative research and
development agreement (CRADA) involving ORNL and TET.

Chrysler, Post Office
Placing Horizon Orders

Electrosource Inc.  (3800 B Drossett Drive, Austin, TX 78744-1131;
Tel: 512/445-6606, Fax: 512/445-6819) has received a production
purchase order from Chrysler Corp.  for trademarked Horizon
advanced lead-acid EV batteries.  Michael G.  Semmens, chairman,
president, and CEO of Electrosource, says the order could result in
additional orders exceeding $80 million cumulatively over the next
three years.  The order provides cost and delivery terms for
battery packs that Chrysler will use in its new EPIC electric
minivan.

Semmens added, "The production purchase order provides the basis
for us to ramp up our manufacturing capacity to meet Chrysler's
production schedules." The order was announced at the EV and
Infrastructure Conference sponsored by the Electric Vehicle
Association of the Americas and co-sponsored by The Electric Power
Research Institute (EPRI), an Electrosource strategic partner.
Chrysler plans to issue build orders to Electrosource against
production and delivery terms described in the PPO.

"Electrosource has met all of the technical requirements to qualify
the advanced Horizon battery for use in our electric minivans,"
said Robert Feldmaier, Chrysler executive engineer in charge of the
electric minivan program.  "We are on schedule with our program to
develop and produce the electric minivan."

Electrosource has received notice that Horizon batteries will be
used in 10 U.S.  Postal Service (USPS) vehicles in two U.S.  cities
slated for evaluation of electric postal vehicles.  Battery
Automated Transportation, International, and U.S.  Electricar each
selected Horizon batteries for use in five vehicles.

Responding to the U.S.  Energy Policy Act requiring an increasing
number of new fleet vehicles to use alternative fuels and the
California mandate for zero-emission vehicles, USPS Vice President
for Engineering William J.  Dowling says, "With our fleet of more
than 200,000 vehicles, it is imperative that we take a leadership
role in demonstrating our commitment to the goals of lower
emissions and energy independence.  Since postal delivery vans
operate with fixed, low-mileage daily routes that are usually
between 12-20 miles, they are excellent candidates for electric
propulsion."

With a majority of funding for the postal vehicle conversion
program coming from the U.S.  Department of Energy, the USPS plans
to convert a total of 25 postal service vehicles in five cities to
electric propulsion systems.  After one year of field testing in
the first phase, the USPS will evaluate the data on all 25 vehicles
to determine the best system.  The second phase of the USPS
conversion program could include conversions of many more mail
carrier vehicles across the nation.

ERC Revenues Up
on Fuel-Cell Activity

Fuel cell and nickel-zinc battery design company Energy Research
Corp.  (3 Great Pasture Road, Danbury, CT 06813; Tel: 203/792-1560,
Fax: 203/798-2945, E-mail: http://www.ercc.com) has reported that
revenues for the 1995 fiscal year increased 13% to $34 million,
compared with revenues of $30 million for the prior year. Bernard
S.  Baker, president and CEO, says the increase in revenues was due
to fuel-cell power-plant construction and test activities and
increased work under the company's various government contracts.

Net income doubled to $442,000 ($0.11 per share) compared with
$220,000 ($0.06 per share) for fiscal 1994.  Net income in the
fourth-quarter fiscal 1995 increased to $90,000 ($0.02 per share)
compared with $37,000 ($0.01 per share).  For the fourth quarter,
revenues decreased 25% to $7.8 million, compared with $10.3 million
in same quarter in the previous year.  Revenues during the quarter
were lower than last year due primarily to completion of
construction of the world's largest carbonate fuel-cell plant in
Santa Clara, CA.  Battery activity also advanced.

Baker told BET, "During 1995, we improved our patent position on
our proprietary nickel-zinc battery that we are developing for
various OEM applications such as laptop computers and other
portable devices.  We are continuing discussions with potential
partners relative to battery opportunities."

Baker also noted that the company was engaged in extensive pre-
testing of its project in Santa Clara, CA, during the fourth
quarter of 1995.  This activity is continuing into the first
quarter of 1996 in anticipation of plant start-up in the second
quarter.  First-quarter revenues this year are likely to be lower
because government contracts are operating under a continuing
resolution from Congress until there is a final budget agreement.


ERC has established a new Internet homepage available at
http://www.ercc.com.  The ERC homepage includes sections describing
the company's fuel-cell and battery technologies, financial
information, and recent news, as well as abstracts of technical
papers prepared by ERC engineers and scientists.  The homepage also
contains links to the home pages of ERC licensees, including AEG
Daimler-Benz, Sanyo Electric, and Mitsubishi Electric Corp., as
well as development partners, including the U.S.  DOE, the Fuel
Cell Commercialization Group, and EPRI.

CARB Mandate
Changes to ZEV

As predicted, the California Air Resources Board (2020 L St.,
Sacramento, CA 95814-4219; Tel: 916/322-2990) has directed its
staff to finalize a plan that would offer changes to the current
Zero Emission Vehicle or ZEV rule, scheduled for introduction in
1998.  The staff's preliminary proposal is to drop the 2%
requirement in the early years of the program and to ramp up to 10%
ZEVs by 2003, when all car companies that sell more than 3,000
vehicles per year statewide must comply with the regulation.

Manufacturers will receive extra ZEV credit though 2003 for EVs
sold before 1998 and those equipped with advanced battery types
that have the range and lifespan that many experts believe is
needed to make them competitive with gasoline-powered models.
Those battery types, including lithium and nickel-based designs,
are expected to be commercially available by 2001.

John Dunlap, CARB chairman, told BET, "This plan provides for a
successful launch of commercially viable electric cars that
protects public health and will provide new high-tech jobs in
California.   This plan promotes a market-based introduction of
ZEV's and will unleash the engineering and the marketing prowess of
automakers.  We have directed our staff to develop that plan and
present it to this board for our consideration at a public hearing
no later than March 1996."

The plan calls for development partnership through a Memorandum of
Agreement that meets the following criteria:

ZEVs should be placed in the Los Angeles and Sacramento basins in
the following volumes: 750 in 1998, 1500 in 1999, and 1500 in 2000
(without credits applied);
Manufacturers would commit to continued ZEV R&D, including the
purchase and evaluation of advanced battery prototypes prior to
1998;
A market incentive (extra ZEV credits) would be provided for
longer-range vehicles and early (pre-1998) vehicles.   Credits
retain full value through 2003;
State of California would purchase some advanced battery vehicles
each year;
Manufacturers would provide adequate materials for training
emergency-response personnel;
All vehicle manufacturer-supported media, publicity, and
legislative initiatives against the ZEV program would be converted
to media, publicity, and legislative initiatives in support of the
partnership and ZEVs;
Ongoing review process with annual reports by a committee of
signatories to include battery technology, market acceptance,
infrastructure, and incentives.  CARB biennial reviews continue
(i.e. 1998, 2000);
Review process to include discussion of product introduction plans
with CARB.
Ford Motor Co.  and Chrysler Corp.  told BET they still plan to
bring EVs to market in California by the 1998 model year despite
the state's decision to delay its electric car mandate by five
years.  Both companies said they were pleased that CARB wants to
ease the 1998 mandate, but they added that CARB's alternative
proposal has some shortcomings, namely that it moves up by a year,
to 2003, the deadline for 10% of vehicles sales being electric.

"We're happy because it's officially on record that the 1998 zero
emission mandate is unworkable,'' said Ford spokesman Howard
Hampton.  ``But there are still a lot of questions as to what they
actually said and did yesterday.  Nothing is set in stone." Eric
Ridenour, Chrysler's director for environmental and energy
planning, said a 10% mandate in 2003 will jeopardize the
development of advanced battery technologies.  "By moving the
required start date forward, we may preclude a fair chance at
getting some of these technologies into the mix. ''

EV advocates are predictably displeased with California's decision.
According to Tim Carmichael of the Coalition for Clean Air (Tel:
415/546-6656), the change in policy is believed to have been
directed by California Gov. Wilson.  He told BET, "We have seen no
scientific or technical reason to delay.  The agency responsible
for world-wide adoption of catalytic converters, unleaded gasoline,
and reformulated gasoline has never before buckled to political
pressure."

Melissa Kaznitz of CALPIRG (Tel: 805/564-1207) was displeased and
said, "This proposal represents the next step in the governor's
attempt to dismantle California's clean air plan.  He is selling
out the environment, high-tech business, and consumers to support
his generous patrons in the oil industry." The bottom line is that
the new plan would require only 3,750 ZEVs available between 1998
and 2000 versus 60,000 under the original proposal.  Roland Hwang
of the Union of Concerned Scientists (Tel: 510/543-1872) said the
plan was "inconsistent with the conclusions of the independent
battery panel that called for strong requirements beginning with
the year 2000 in order to maintain research and investment."

It is too soon to say for sure whether other states considering EV
mandates will follow suit, but EV advocates in New York and
Massachusetts are concerned.  Sonia Hamel, the director of air
policy for the state of Massachusetts, says Massachusetts Gov.
William Weld is "very disappointed." She fears that Massachusetts
and New York both are bound to follow California's ZEV program.
Hamel went on to point out that the abrupt 10% requirement in 2003
is not a "smart market launch." Jamie Phillips of the Planning and
Conservation League (Tel: 916/444-8726) added, "From zero to 10% is
a giant leap.  It requires a leap of faith in the car companies --
in whom we have little faith."

Chrysler Introduces
Epic Electric Minivan

Chrysler Corp.  (12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland Park, MI 48288-
1899; Tel: 313/956-5657) introduced the "Epic" electric minivan at
the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas EV and
Infrastructure Conference in Atlanta, GA.  Robert Feldmaier,
executive engineer for Chrysler's electric minivan program told the
conference, "We see the Epic as the next logical step in the
development of electric vehicles."

The Epic, acronym for "Electric Powered Interurban Commuter," was
developed with Westinghouse and, as described in this issue of BET,
will initially offer the Electrosource Horizon advanced lead-acid
battery.  Chrysler has the ability to build the vehicle on-line at
its Windsor, Ontario, Assembly Plant as part of regular production.
No conversion is necessary.  The Epic model designation will be
applied to both Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager models that are
optioned with electric power.

Due to development and competitive reasons, the launch date for the
vehicle will not be released at this time.  Feldmaier explained,
"There are several final supplier issues that need to be worked
through, so we're not ready to give an exact launch date.  However,
we've made it clear that this vehicle would be available by the
1998 model year, and that has not changed." Feldmaier added that
demand for the vehicle will also be a factor in establishing a
launch target date.  Cost and range are the two critical market
issues that will shape fleet customer demand.

"Because the minivan is by far our most successful vehicle, and
because it has the unique ability to work as either a commuter
vehicle or a utility vehicle, this platform made the most sense to
us for electric power," he said.  "The large flat floor also gives
us plenty of room to store batteries, and more importantly, to
change battery types as new technologies are developed.  Right now
we're able to get 27 modules at about 1,600 pounds on board of the
advanced lead-acid battery.  We anticipate a range of about 60
miles under ideal conditions with that amount and type of battery."

Cost and price of the vehicle have not been finalized.  Feldmaier
said the low-volume componentry and the cost of batteries will make
the vehicle "significantly more costly than a comparable gasoline
minivan." However, as is the case with all Chrysler production
vehicle launches, pricing will not be announced until the release
date of the vehicle has been established.

The Epic will incorporate several unique customer features,
including a powermeter that gives the amount of power being drawn
by the driver to help optimize driving style to extend range.  The
vehicle will also feature anti-lock regenerative brakes and dual
airbags and will meet all federal safety regulations.

Chrysler will target many of the fleet and utility customers that
have previously purchased its electric and compressed natural gas
(CNG) vehicles.  "At this stage of development, EVs will obviously
have a very limited customer base," said Mike Clement, manager of
alternative fuel vehicle sales and marketing.  "We'll first target
those fuel providers that are required to buy alternative fuel
vehicles under the Energy Policy Act."

The Epic will feature an AC Induction Motor with 100 peak hp and 75
hp continuous, along with a single-speed, front-wheel-drive
transaxle.  The EV weighs 5900 lbs.  and can carry a payload of 800
lbs.  The wheelbase is 113 inches in length by 186.3 inches wide by
75.6 inches high, resulting in 68.5 inches in cargo space and 146.2
cubic feet capacity with the seats removed.  The Epic accelerates
from 0 to 60 mph in 16 seconds, has a top speed of 80 mph, and a
range of 60 miles (SAE J1634 cycle - no accessories).

Conductive Charging
Prototypes Displayed

Ford Motor Co. (The American Road, Dearborn, MI 48121; Tel:
313/322-3000) and Chrysler Corp. (12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland
Park, MI 48288; Tel: 313/956-5741) have unveiled a prototype of a
conductive charging system that the two automakers will use for
their production model electric vehicles (EVs).

Working models of the prototypes will be built so that utilities
can begin planning for their installation.  By choosing conductive
charging, Ford and Chrysler have taken a step toward standardizing
a crucial part of the infrastructure necessary to support the
eventual commercialization of EVs.

With EV structure, the goal is to avoid the VHS-versus-Beta
problems we saw with early video tape technology, says John
Wallace, director - Electric Vehicle Programs at Ford.  By
choosing one standard system of charging, automakers will assist
utility companies responsible for the installation of the EV-
charging network.

The prototype charging system was built by SCI Systems Inc. (Box
1000, Huntsville, AL 35807; Tel: 205/882-4601), a contract
manufacturer of electronic assemblies and products.  The conductive
system includes a home connecting device, which controls and
manages power, and a plug said to be safe and easy to use in all
weather conditions.

We chose a conductive charging system for our production EVs for
numerous reasons, says Bob Davis, executive engineer - Chrysler
Electric Vehicles.  We believe conductive charging is safe and the
most efficient and cost effective method of charging available.
Also, it is well understood by professional electricians and
requires no special tools, expensive diagnostic equipment, or
specialized training for widespread installation.

Conductive charging, the traditional method of connecting
electrical equipment to power sources, uses mating contacts to
transfer the electricity.  Home electric clothes dryers, with their
specially designed mating plugs, use conductive connections.  Like
them, EVs will use a unique--yet standardized--plug.  SCI
engineered the prototype system to the specifications of Chrysler,
Ford, five other automobile manufacturers, electric utilities, and
the California Air Resources Board (CARB).

The parties have been working together as part of the
Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) sponsored by the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI).  The IWC was formed in 1991 to
help develop an infrastructure that will allow EV owners to safely
and conveniently plug into charging stations at their homes and
other locations.  These infrastructure products will serve as the
basis for standards under development by the Society of Automotive
Engineers (SAE) and will be proposed as international standards.

SatCon Develops Award-
Winning Technology

SatCon Technology Corp. (161 First St., Cambridge, MA 02142-1221;
Tel: 617/661-0540, Fax: 617/661-3373) is applying its award-winning
flywheel technology to the development of a drivetrain for
Chrysler's innovative, high-speed, hybrid electric race car, the
Patriot.  The car will serve as a "laboratory on wheels" for
advanced developments that could be part of future commercial
vehicles.  Now undergoing testing, the Patriot race car could top
200 miles per hour.

Winner of the Discover Award, SatCon's advanced hybrid electric
race car drivetrain consists of the following components:  a gas
turbine engine, a compact turboalternator unit (TAU), a carbon-
fiber flywheel, an electric traction motor/generator, and a
controller.  An efficient onboard fuel-burning (liquified natural
gas) turbine with a high power-to-weight ratio generates one-half
of a megawatt of electricity.  Power storage and load-leveling
takes place in a high-speed flywheel, which spins at 58,300 rpm.
The wheels are driven by the world's most powerful electric motor
for its size.  The one-foot in diameter motor produces more than
500 horsepower and allows regenerative braking.

The flywheel provides energy to power the traction motor and
augments the reduced-sized (about the size of a shoebox) TAU. The
TAU integrates a high-speed gas turbine with an efficient, high-
frequency AC induction and alternator in a two-spool arrangement on
each shaft.  Each spool generates 185 kW.  The power controller
weighs less than 100 pounds and handles enough current to power 200
homes.

Patriot's flywheel readily accepts regenerated braking energy
during deceleration and quickly charges, cycles, and releases that
energy as the car accelerates.  Custom-designed magnetic bearings
and a vacuum seal eliminate friction and drag losses, enabling the
flywheel to release nearly 90% of the energy it absorbs during
deceleration.

During races, technicians will rev the Patriot's flywheel up to
60,000 rpm, thereby providing enough energy for fast acceleration
as the race begins. The flywheel provides engine optimization by
enabling the combustion engine to run at a constant rate, thereby
saving energy.  In an all-electric vehicle, the flywheel can double
the range of the vehicle and extend the life of the battery pack.

SatCon will soon apply versions of the primary components of the
Patriot drivetrain to the following applications:

The advanced flywheel will serve as a source of "bridging power"
and power conditioning for commercial utility and residential
applications.
The compact turboalternator will provide a very high output,
portable power supply for heavy construction and military use, as
well as prime power for heavy equipment.
The ultra-high-output electric motor will be used to create quiet,
compact, but powerful air conditioning and chilling systems that
are 25% more energy efficient than those in use today.
The compact high-density controller is a key component for a new
generation of intelligent electromechanical products.

These SatCon components make use of advanced technologies
originally developed for defense and aerospace purposes.  SatCon's
flywheels started as energy storage and positioning systems for
orbiting satellites.  The turboalternator that converts the output
of the turbine engine into electric current was developed as a
stationary power source for the Army.  The steel in the ultra-high
output electric motor was developed for a weapons system.

SatCon's Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) system consists of a high-
speed flywheel, a motor/generator, a bearing support system, and a
containment/vacuum housing.  Power and control electronics
efficiently shuttle electrical energy in and out of the flywheel.
Whether in a vehicle or in stationary applications, the firm's FES
systems offer a variety of benefits, including low losses and
efficient operation, long life, safe operation and easy disposal,
braking energy recovery, and electric or hybrid vehicle
improvements.

For space applications, SatCon supplies the FES systems to NASA for
momentum recovery and spacecraft attitude control.  The firm's
innovative integrated Power and Attitude Control System combines
energy storage and spacecraft-control functions in a single FES
system.

For utility applications, SatCon's FES systems provide continuous
electrical power to critical machines and operations during
lighting strikes and other utility line faults.  FES systems can
solve quality problems caused by modern, high-frequency switching
power supplies.  Also, FES systems provide off-peak storage options
for reducing power-generation requirements to meet peak power
demands.

The company is developing a lightweight flywheel, uninterrupted
power supply for the Marine Corps.  This system will prevent
irregularities in voltage and frequency that could result in power
failure or the interruption of critical processes.

Flywheel Powers
Ford Concept Car

The new Ford Motor Co.  (14310 Hamilton Ave., Highland Park, MI
48203; Tel: 800/258-3835) Synergy 2010 is a hybrid EV developed as
a concept car to explore futuristic alternatives that could
theoretically triple the fuel efficiency of a typical family sedan.


At the vehicle's recent roll-out, Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and
chief executive officer, disclosed that the Synergy 2010 is powered
by a small, 1.0-liter direct-injection, compression-ignited engine
mounted in the rear that would power a generator that produces
electricity for motors located in each wheel.  Up front, a flywheel
collects excess engine and braking energy, which in turn would be
released to augment the engine when, for example, the car needed to
accelerate quickly or climb hills.

Bob Mull, director of Ford's New Generation Vehicle program, says
that in a direct-injection, compression-ignited engine, high
pressure or heat is used instead of spark plugs to ignite the fuel,
resulting in higher efficiency.  Theoretically, the Synergy 2010's
performance with this smaller engine would be comparable to today's
mid-sized family sedan because of its decreased weight, improved
aerodynamics and lower rolling resistance.

Although not mass buildable at this time, Trotman says, "Synergy
2010 is a good example of the kind of quantum leap, breakthrough
thinking we're encouraging in our new global alignment."

Duracell and Eveready
Include Charge Testers

Both Eveready (Checkerboard Square, St. Louis, MO 63164; Tel:
800/323-8177) and Duracell International Inc.  (Berkshire
Industrial Park, Bethel, CT 06801; Tel: 203/796-4000 or 800/422-
9001, Fax: 203/791-3273)  have announced plans to introduce
proprietary manganese-zinc alkaline batteries that incorporate
real-time charge testers.

In an interesting legal situation that will keep patent attorneys
occupied until the matter is definitively settled, both companies
claim to control valid patents for the same technology.
Spokespeople for both companies are claiming to be the "first" to
introduce these testers, with roll-out dates scheduled for first-
quarter 1996.

Eveready made the first announcement when Vice President of
Marketing David Hatfield proclaimed that the company would
introduce "the first on-battery tester," which he promises will
"jolt the consumer electronics industry by enabling users to test
the power of their Energizer brand batteries at any time for
unprecedented confidence in battery-operated products and
appliances." He added that the new Energizer on-battery tester will
be rolled out worldwide beginning with a U.S.  introduction in the
spring of 1996.  The tester was originally developed and patented
by Strategic Electronics (Reno, NV).

The Energizer on-battery tester will be available on AA, C, and D
cell sizes.  Like the Duracell tester, it utilizes thermochromic
technology that measures the amount of power in a battery based on
the amount of heat generated in the tester.  A consumer simply
presses both green dots firmly for 10 seconds.  At full power, the
word "GOOD" appears in the tester window.  When the tester stays
completely black, less than 25 percent of the power is remaining.


According to Hatfield, research indicates that 95% of consumers
prefer the convenience of the Energizer on-battery tester over
testers incorporated into the packaging.  With the on-battery
tester, consumers can check the power on the spot anytime, anywhere
-- without having to store or carry anything.  The new Energizer
way eliminates the clutter and hassle of having to store on-package
testers.  Moreover, 94% of consumers liked the idea after they
tried it, and nearly all (97%) said they'd recommend it to friends.

"Our research indicates consumers want to be able to determine
whether or not their batteries are good without the hassle of
having to save the packaging," said Hatfield.  "With the Energizer
on-battery tester, they'll never be caught off-guard in guessing
the state of batteries in their cameras, toys, portable cassette
players, or other frequently used electronic devices."

Energizer says that the U.S.  launch of the new Energizer on-
battery tester will be supported with an aggressive television and
print advertising campaign, as well as in-store promotion and
merchandising.  The convenience of the new product will be touted
through a national television campaign.

After Eveready's announcement, Duracell immediately responded with
its own declaration claiming what the company calls "the world's
first alkaline battery with a fuel-gauge-like power tester."
According to Duracell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charles
R.  Perrin, the new trademarked line of PowerCheck Batteries allow
consumers to determine a battery's power anytime, anywhere.
Specifically, PowerCheck Batteries will be rolled out worldwide,
beginning with a launch of AA-sizes in the U.S. in the late spring
of 1996.  Availability in Canada and Europe will follow in the
summer of 1996, and PowerCheck Batteries will be sold in AAA, C,
and D sizes in early 1997.

Like the Eveready system, PowerCheck Batteries feature a fuel-
gauge-like tester located directly on the battery.  To activate the
tester, consumers press the dots on the side and bottom edge of the
battery.  A yellow thermochromic indicator measures heat resistance
in the cell and provides an easy-to-read indication of remaining
battery power.  When remaining battery power is sufficient, the
display rises into the "Good" zone on the indicator.  When
remaining battery power is insufficient, the display remains in the
"Replace" zone.  Perrin says that the launch of the PowerCheck
Batteries will be supported with new advertising and strong in-
store promotional activities.

The tester is the result of a joint venture between Duracell and
Avery Dennison Corp.  Charles D.  Miller, chairman and chief
executive officer of Avery Dennison, says this strategic alliance
was established two years ago.  Duracell licensed the original
technology from Eastman Kodak Co..  Kodak was awarded at patent for
the technology in 1991 (about the same time as Strategic Alliance)
in what was probably an error by the patent office.

In fiscal 1995, Eveready shipped almost 1.5 billion alkaline
batteries in North America alone and sold more than 6 billion
batteries in 160 countries.

Benchmarq Files
Chip Patent Suit

Semiconductor manufacturer Benchmarq Microelectronics Inc.  (2611
Westgrove Drive, Suite 109, Carrollton, TX 75006; Tel: 214/407-
9845) has filed a lawsuit against Dallas Semiconductor Corp.  (4401
S. Beltwood Parkway, Dallas, TX 75244-3292) in the Federal District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division.

In that lawsuit, Benchmarq is seeking a declaratory judgment that
certain of the company's products, including its bq2010/Battery
Management Product, bq4287/Real Time Clock Module, bq2201/Non-
Volatile Static Random Access Memory Controller Product, and
certain related products, do not infringe upon various patents held
by Dallas Semiconductor.

Derrell C.  Coker, Benchmarq's president, says the company filed
its lawsuit in response to allegations by Dallas Semiconductor that
Benchmarq's products may infringe upon various patents held by
Dallas Semiconductor.  Coker added, "In its product-development
efforts, Benchmarq has always attempted to ensure that its products
do not infringe upon the patents of any party and intends to
vigorously defend its products against this type of claim." With
this in mind, "Benchmarq felt that it had to act forcefully to
defend the integrity of its product-development effort."

Benchmarq designs, develops, and markets mixed-signal (analog and
digital) integrated circuits and electronic modules for portable
and power-sensitive electronic systems.  Benchmarq's battery
management integrated circuits and modules control fast-charging,
conditioning, and monitoring of rechargeable batteries, principally
for portable electronic systems, including personal computers,
cellular telephones, camcorders, power tools, shavers, and
electronic games.

Dueling Charging
Standards Created

Ford Motor Co.  (14310 Hamilton Ave., Highland Park, MI 48203; Tel:
313/390-2310) and Chrysler Corp.  (12000 Chrysler Drive, Highland
Park, MI 48288-1899; Tel: 313/956-5657) has selected conductive
charging for their "standard" EV refueling technique.  Ford
director of Vehicle Programs John Wallace told said that,  "With EV
infrastructure, the goal is to avoid the VHS-versus-Beta problems
we saw with early videotape technology.  By choosing one standard
system of charging, automakers will assist utility companies
responsible for the installation of the EV charging network."
Unfortunately, this decision is actually a step backwards for EV
infrastructure standardization and creates precisely the kind of
VHS/Beta situation Wallace says he is trying to avoid.

This is because GM and its subsidiary Hughes (432 N. Saginaw St.,
Suite 801, Flint, MI 48502; Tel: 800-253-5328), with the support of
the Department of Energy and the public utilities' research
consortium Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), have already
picked inductive charging as an EV "standard." Conductive charging,
which is currently used by most EVs, depends on a direct conductor-
to-conductor contact between the electrical power source, the
charger's rectifier(s), and the EV's battery.  GM's charging uses
a non-conductive inductive connection between the power source and
the battery.

Which system is "better?" Conductive charging is less expensive (on
the order of $1,000 for a single vehicle system, versus on the
order of $2,000 for an inductive system).  Inductive charging is
faster (at least twice as fast, and if properly configured, much
faster).  Inductive charging is theoretically not as efficient as
conductive charging.  However, in practice, both systems are about
equally efficient.  Inductive systems (which use plastic, as
opposed to metal parts) weigh less.  Inductive systems may be safer
than conductive systems, especially if charging takes place outside
in the rain.  GM and EPRI cite this as a pivotal advantage.  Ford
says conductive systems can be made just as safe as inductive
systems.

The real answer to the Ford/Chrysler decision may be due to
marketing considerations.  The system they selected is available in
prototype form as the "home connecting device" from SCI Systems
(2101 Clinton Ave., Huntsville, AL 35805; Tel: 205/882-4800), an
established electronics and avionics design and manufacturing
company and a rival of GM's Hughes subsidiary in the aerospace and
other electronics markets.

SCI, like Hughes, is a member of the Department of Energy's EV
Infrastructure Working Council (IWC), but it was a relative
latecomer to the EV infrastructure business.  The Department of
Energy, via EPRI, has been promoting inductive charging as the best
bet for EV applications since the late 80s.  This attitude had all
but assured that GM and Hughes, which control key inductive-
charging technology, would come to dominate the EV charging
infrastructure.

It was only recently, and with a considerable amount of reluctance,
that EPRI has expanded its view to encompass the possibility of
widespread conductive EV charging.  Even if the wide use of EVs is
delayed, the decision is of more than academic interest.  Whether
it happens in five years or 20 years, the creation of an EV-
charging infrastructure will require billions of dollars of
capital.
