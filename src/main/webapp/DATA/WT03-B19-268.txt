<P>
Hamilton and District has set itself the objective of becoming
Australia's leading integrated wool centre.  Hamilton is the
centre of one of the most concentrated wool-growing areas in the
world.  About 120 million kilograms of wool, which represents
about 18 per cent of the Australian clip, is grown within two
hundred kilometres of the provincial city of Hamilton.
<P>
<img src="gifs2/hamsheep.gif" align=right>
Wools range from ultra fine to carpet quality, and are noted for
being soft handling and free of fault and vegetable matter.  As
well as wool production, Hamilton is a centre for wool processing,
wool buying, agricultural research, rural training, LandCare and
tourism.
<P>
Recent major wool industry developments include the expansion
of Hamilton Wool Processing and the decision by Australian Topmaking
Services to establish a commission combing plant.
<P>
Natural gas will be connected to Hamilton in mid 1995, ensuring
that industry ha<I>s </I>access to extremely competitively priced
energy, as well as water and effluent disposal.  Hamilton's infrastructure
is capable of servicing a wide variety of industries.
</FONT>
<H2>Transport centre</H2>
<P>
The provincial city of Hamilton services the district, comprising
one urban and six rural municipalities.  It is located at the
junction of three highways, directly connecting with Ballarat,
Melbourne, Mt Gambier and Geelong.  The deep water port at Portland
is only eighty kilometres away.
<P>
Hamilton is ideally located to service industries and markets
in south-west Victoria and south-east South Australia.  Several
major road transport companies are located in the region and national
overnight express services operate to Hamilton and nearby towns.
<P>
Regular bus services connect the region to Melbourne, Ballarat,
Mt Gambier and Warrnambool.  The Ararat to Portland rail line
passes through Hamilton, with connections to Melbourne, Geelong,
Mt Gambier and Adelaide.  This line has been converted to standard
gauge.
<P>
A V-Line Rail Freight Gate service operates at Hamilton, and an
all-weather, 24-hour airport is located nine kilometres from the
centre of the city.  It has a 2400 metre runway, a modern passenger
terminal and aircraft maintenance facilities.
<H2>Service centre</H2>
<img src="gifs2/hamdairy.gif" align=right>
<P>
Hamilton and District offers a wide range of education, health,
cultural, recreation and other community services.  Six public
and three private secondary colleges serve Hamilton.  The South
West College of TAFE (Hamilton campus) offers business, industrial
and rural courses.
<P>
The Wool and Rural Industries Skill Training Centre (WRIST) is
dedicated to providing training excellence for the wool and rural
industries nationally.  The centre is developing courses in wool
production and quality assurance, sheep and cattle husbandry,
farm management and farm business planning, wool processing, wool
textile technology, management, marketing and agribusiness.
<H2>Industry encouraged</H2>

<P>
Land for industrial development is readily available, including
large parcels where buffer zones are necessary.  Land in and near
Hamilton is capable of catering for most types of industrial development.
 The city has a fully serviced estate for light industrial development
with highway frontage, and another estate zoned for heavy industrial
use.
<P>
There is also land available around Hamilton which is suitable
for industrial development, and local municipalities encourage
industry.
<P>
The city provides rate relief, low interest loans and technical
assistance, and is prepared to negotiate reduced rates and provide
technical and town planning assistance for significant industrial
projects.
<H2>Water available</H2>

<P>
The local authorities work closely with the Water Board to provide
essential services.  Other municipalities in the district have
similar assistance packages for development projects.
<P>
The Board provides high quality soft water at competitive rates,
and a new storage basin giving additional capacity for industry
has been completed.  Substantial quantities of recycled waste
water are also available.
<P>
The Board operates a modern sewage treatment plant, which is constantly
being expanded, to handle specialised wastes.  The Board is prepared
to negotiate special arrangements for large waste and effluent
requirements.
<H2>Opportunities in processing</H2>

<P>
Wool, beef and sheep production, a wide range of grain crops,
timber harvesting and processing of native eucalyptus forests
and pine plantations (mainly in the western part of the region),
provide the basis for a number of industries.
<P>
The region has two large abattoirs supplying outlets in most Australian
states.  Ten million sheep and 400,000 cattle are grazed within
a one-hundred-kilometre radius of Hamilton, which has a major
livestock marketing complex. Consequently, opportunities abound
in food processing.  Suitably serviced land and a stable workforce
is available for an additional abattoir or meat processing activities,
including a rendering plant or skin processing.
<P>
Extensive Government and private pine plantations along the Victoria/South
Australia border offer opportunities for firms to expand timber
production, milling, processing and wood chipping.
<H2>Natural attractions</H2>

<P>
Tourist attractions include the extensive Grampians Ranges, which
form the north-eastern boundary of the region, the Wannon and Glenelg
Rivers, the native forest in the south-west and a number of prominent
volcanic cones.  Together with features such as wineries and historic
buildings, they provide a wide variety of recreational and scenic
features for residents and visitors.
