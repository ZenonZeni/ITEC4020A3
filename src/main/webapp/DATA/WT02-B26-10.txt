<H2>NAMI Submits Brief In Insurance Case</H2>
by Ron Honberg, Director, NAMI Legal Affairs
<hr>




	The fight to end pervasive discrimination against brain disorders in health insurance policies is being fought in the courts as well as in state legislatures and in Congress.  Recently, NAMI filed an amicus ("friend of the court") brief in a case considering this very issue.
<P>
	In Klebe v. Mitre Health Care Plan, a self-insured group health plan contained a lower lifetime maximum for "mental health benefits" than for "medical" benefits.  After exhausting all administrative appeals, the policy-holders filed suit in federal court arguing that their son's schizophrenia should be covered under the lifetime maximum for "medical treatment," not that for "mental health treatment."  After the federal district court granted summary judgement in favor of the health plan, the policyholders appealed to the Federal Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, where oral arguments are currently pending.  NAMI's brief was submitted to the Fourth Circuit in support of the policy holders.
<P>
	In granting summary judgement in favor of the health plan, the district court refused to accept evidence offered by the policyholders that schizophrenia is a biological disorder of the brain and is therefore a medical disorder.  Instead, the court determined that benefits under the plan should be classified based on the nature of treatment rendered, not by the nature of the particular illness itself.  In the court's view, the particular treatments received by the son of the policyholders (psychotropic medication, psychotherapy, etc.) fell into the category of "mental health treatment" not "medical treatment."
<P>
	In its brief, NAMI argued that the district court's application of a "treatment determinative" method of classifying mental health vs. medical benefits was incorrect based both on construction of the particular insurance policy and on court cases in other jurisdictions that have considered this issue.  There have been several cases around the country in which courts have recognized that distinctions between "mental health" and "medical" benefits should be based on the nature and etiology of particular disorders, not on specific treatments received for those disorders. 
<P>
 	For example, in Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield v. Doe, 733 S.W.2d 429 (Ark. App. 1987), an Arkansas court of appeals held that bipolar affective disorder is a physical condition and should therefore be covered (in the particular insurance policy in question) as a medical, not a mental health disorder.  Similar decisions have been reached in cases involving autism, Kunin v. Benefit Trust Life Insurance Co., 910 F. 2d 534 (9th Cir. 1990), and organic brain syndrome, Phillips v. Lincoln National Life Insurance Co., 978 F.2d 302 (7th Cir. 1992) and Malerbi v. Central Reserve Life of North America Insurance Co., 225 Neb. 543 (1987).  
<P>
	Having cited these cases, NAMI's brief asserted that the district court was mistaken in its failure to consider evidence submitted by several scientific experts who presented affidavits in this case.  Both of these experts, reflecting virtual consensus within science, concluded that schizophrenia is a physical disorder.  This clearly establishes, NAMI argued, that "as a brain disorder, schizophrenia has far more in common with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Tourette's syndrome and Parkinson's disease than it does with mental health problems and conditions related to life stressors or environmental factors....As a disorder affecting the brain, schizophrenia is a medical disorder, just as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are medical disorders.
<P>
	This case, like the others cited above, unfortunately reflects the limitations of arguing that health insurance policies should cover disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar illness, and major depression as "medical disorders" based on the language of the insurance policies themselves.  Even when these arguments succeed, insurance companies simply change the language of their policies to list specific diagnostic categories that will be covered at lower levels.  Consequently, these cases have not heralded the end of discrimination against brain disorders in health insurance policies, even in the states in which the decisions have occurred. 
<P>
 	To date, there have been no major cases that have held that lower levels of coverage of brain disorders in health insurance policies constitutes discrimination.  And the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) has issued interim guidelines that stipulate that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not apply to lower levels of coverage of "mental nervous disorders" in health insurance policies.  Consequently, although these guidelines are not binding on courts, it will be difficult to succeed with an argument that Title I of the ADA prohibits discrimination of this nature.  
   <P>
	Despite their limited precedential value, court cases such as the one discussed here, coupled with ongoing efforts by AMI advocates to achieve passage of insurance parity bills in states, can be valuable tools for educating policy makers, judges, and the public about the historical inequities in coverage of biological brain disorders.  Moreover, a few highly publicized court cases can serve to spur legislative bodies to enact legislation concerning practices identified as inequitable and unfair.  Consequently, a comprehensive assault on ending the historical discrimination against brain disorders in health insurance should involve both legislative efforts and, where necessary, legal challenges.
<P>
	A copy of the brief submitted by NAMI in this case can be obtained by contacting Sue Medford at 703/524-7600.
<P>
In granting summary judgement in favor of the health plan, the district court refused to accept evidence offered by the policyholders that schizophrenia is a biological disorder of the brain and is therefore a medical disorder.
