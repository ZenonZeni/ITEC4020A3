Active aftermarket and capacity glut predicted

      Unseasonably mild weather in the Northeast has created a lull
in the capacity market after a busy bid week, and sources are
predicting an active aftermarket for capacity in November if the
mild weather keeps up.
      Replacement shippers held about 10 billion cfd in released firm
capacity on Oct. 28, down about 1.5 billion cfd from Sept. 28.
Storage capacity releases were done on CNG Transmission and Texas
Eastern Transmission.
      The aftermarket for capacity should be active now that
pipelines aren't discounting transportation as deeply and if the
weather stays mild, said Ben Hadden with Appalachian Gas Sales.
      He said there have been more release deals done this bid week
than during prior bid weeks, partly because bottlenecks haven't
shown up yet on the long-haul pipelines out of the Gulf Coast. In
past years capacity restraints usually had caused some problems
by now, but pipelines aren't anticipating allocating supply in the
near future, he added.
      "The market is pretty dead right now," said an official with a
Northeastern distributor. But look out if the weather suddenly
turns cold, he said. "If the weather all of a sudden heads south,
markets in the Northeast will catch fire."
      The distributor official said his company held on to its
Tennessee capacity in case the weather turns and its Texas Eastern
capacity so far wasn't selling very well.
      He said there is no demand on CNG, but demand on Columbia Gas
picked up a bit with its recallable capacity going for about a 5
cents/mcf daily demand rate. On Columbia Gulf, the official said he
got a 9 cents/mcf rate for capacity to Leach, Ky.
      The Lebanon, Ohio, interconnect was "really hot" during bid
week for gas sales and capacity releases, according to Hadden.
      On Texas Gas Transmission, Dayton Power & Light released
capacity in about 13 November release deals into Lebanon for daily
demand rates ranging from 5 cents/mcf to CMS Gas Marketing to
17.5 cents/mcf to Tenneco Gas Marketing.
      Term deals for the winter and beyond and storage releases are
starting to pop up on electronic bulletin boards. On CNG, the
Harriman Utility Board released 26 million cf of various storage
capacity on the pipeline to CNG Gas Services for an injection rate of
2.6 cents/mcf and a withdrawal rate of 2.8 cents/mcf. Boston Gas
picked up storage capacity on Texas Eastern from Dartmouth Power
and Bristol & Warren.
      Texas-Ohio Gas picked up about 16 million cf from Yankee Gas
in three term deals on Texas Eastern for about a 13 cents/mcf daily
demand rate in the field and a 21 cents/mcf rate into zone three.
All three deals run through March 1995.
      One source said if shippers start pulling the high-priced gas
they bought last April out of Northeastern storage there will
probably be plenty of capacity coming out of the Gulf Coast access
areas in November.
      Another source said he also expects an active aftermarket as
long as the weather stays mild. He said he's been getting a lot of
calls from customers willing to pay maximum rate into the
Northeast.
      Recallable deals on Tennessee into zone five were going for a
daily demand rate in the low-30 cents/mcf range, according to the
source.

Northern Border plans expansion into Indiana

      Northern Border Pipeline is seeking customers for a proposed
capacity expansion of its existing system and a pipeline extension
into Northern Indiana.
      The proposed capacity expansion involves increasing receipt
capacity by at least 60 million cfd between the Monchy receipt
point at the U.S./Canadian border and the Glen Ullin, N.D., receipt
point on the 42-inch system.
      The 30-inch system between Ventura and Harper, Iowa, is
marked for a 260 million cfd capacity expansion. Both expansions
will be accomplished through the addition of compression.
      The proposed extension into Northern Indiana involves three
legs that start with 163 miles of 30-inch pipeline from Harper,
Iowa, to Northern Illinois Gas' (NIGas) Troy Grove storage field in
Illinois.
      Along this segment, Northern Border proposes to connect with
Interstate Power at Prophetstown, Ill. The pipeline plans 2,200 hp
of compression for this leg with a maximum capacity of 260 million
cfd.
      From Troy Grove, Northern Border plans to build 69 miles of
26-inch pipeline without compression to Manhattan, Ill., where it
will connect with Peoples Gas Light & Coke in the area of Joliet, Ill.
Maximum capacity on this leg will also be 260 million cfd.
      The proposed extension then continues eastward 35 miles with
20-inch pipe into Northern Indiana to connect with Northern
Indiana Public Service (NIPSCO) at Griffith, Ind. Maximum capacity
on this segment will be 175 million cfd.
      Northern Border has not sought FERC approval for the project
yet. The pipeline has targeted Nov. 1, 1997, as the in-service date
for the expansion. The window for bidding on this potential
capacity opened Oct. 24 and will close Nov. 18, 1994. Northern
Border will do a final allocation of bids for the capacity and post
them on its electronic bulletin board by Dec. 16, 1994.
      For more information about the expansion, contact Bill Fonda
with Northern Border at 402-398-7756.

Pipelines go easy on scheduled November maintenance

      Few disruptions in capacity are expected during November as
scheduled maintenance continues to remain light on pipelines
across the United States.
      Starting Nov. 2, ANR Pipeline will be lowering a line at a stream
crossing upstream of the Eakley compressor station. The
maintenance work is scheduled to last about three days. Receipt
points in line segments SW2H, SW2I and SW2J will be shut in
during the work.
      On Oct. 31, Tennessee Gas Pipeline was at capacity through
station 219 in Mercer, Pa., and near capacity on the Sullivan City
lateral in Hidalgo, Texas. The pipeline said it may restrict services
starting Nov. 2.
      Texas Eastern Transmission was at capacity for interruptible
transportation on the 24-inch system through station 16 at Berne,
Ohio, and into the suction of Berne, Ohio, from the 24-inch system
on Nov. 1. The Wilcox, Willow Springs and Monroe laterals were also
at capacity.
      On Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, flow through station 40 at
Sour Lake, Texas, was being allocated on Nov. 1. Also on Transco,
interruptible capacity was limited to 100 million cfd from station
180 in Virginia eastward.

Market

      A marketer in New England said Monday about gas prices, "I
think they'll come off a little bit." And a buyer in Houston
expected much the same, pointing to this week's December futures
close at almost a nickel off last week.
      In other trading, an eastern LDC was fishing for baseload gas
into Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at station 65 at $1.74 but
couldn't find any baseload sellers under $1.78. Swing sellers were
offering deals at $1.72.
      At Parkway, Ontario, into the Union Gas system, buyers wanted
prices in the mid-$1.90s yesterday, while sellers wanted $2.05-15
for their gas.
      A West Coast marketer bought some Permian gas on El Paso at
$1.62, a healthy jump from the mid- to high-$1.50s at the end of
last week. He thought the price increase, which some sources said
had reached $1.68 by late yesterday afternoon, might be in
anticipation of some colder weather moving down from the
Northwest. He was hoping to sell it in the mid-$1.60s.
      Prices at AECO-C ranged from C$1.70-$1.80/gj for day-to-day
trading, and at Sumas into Northwest and at Kingsgate into PGT
prices hovered around $1.50.

Futures

      December futures will find technical support at around $1.93,
with short covering expecting at that level, said an analyst.
However, the contract is expected to find its ceiling at $1.87 and
then trade lower.

Storage

      With withdrawal season right around the corner, net injections
into storage jumped to 8.6 billion cfd, more than double the
previous week's, according to the American Gas Assn.'s (AGA)
survey for the week ending Oct. 21.
      This turnaround at the end of the injection season pushed
working gas in storage to 3,081 billion cf, after passing 3 trillion cf
the previous week, according to AGA's survey. Storage facilities
nationwide are now 96% full, using AGA's estimated full level of
3,206 billion cf.
      Sources said the big increase in injections was probably due to
storage users trying to top off their storage capacity in the last few
weeks of injection season.
      Net injections were 60 billion cf, up 36 billion cf, or 5.1 billion
cfd, from last week's estimate.
      Storage facilities in the east hit 97% full, compared to 95% the
preceding week. The producing region appears to have completed its
injections, with net injections of only 1 billion cf.
