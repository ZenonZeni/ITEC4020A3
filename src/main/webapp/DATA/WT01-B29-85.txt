LETTER </p>

<p> February 1995 </p>

<p> The President of the Senate </p>

<p> The Speaker of the House of Representatives </p>

<p> In 1990, the General Accounting Office began a special effort
to </p>

<p> review and report on the federal program areas we considered
high </p>

<p> risk because they were especially vulnerable to waste, fraud,
abuse, </p>

<p> and mismanagement. This effort, which has been strongly
supported by </p>

<p> the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House
Committee </p>

<p> on Government Reform and Oversight, brought much needed focus
to </p>

<p> problems that were costing the government billions of
dollars. </p>

<p> In December 1992, we issued a series of reports on the
fundamental </p>

<p> causes of problems in designated high-risk areas. We are
updating </p>

<p> the status of our high-risk program in this second series.
Our </p>

<p> Overview report (GAO/HR-95-1) discusses progress made in many
areas, </p>

<p> stresses the need for further action to address remaining
critical </p>

<p> problems, and introduces newly designated high-risk areas.
This </p>

<p> second series also includes a Quick Reference Guide
(GAO/HR-95-2) </p>

<p> that covers all 18 high-risk areas we have tracked over the
past few </p>

<p> years, and separate reports that detail continuing
significant </p>

<p> problems and resolution actions needed in 10 areas. </p>

<p> This report discusses the asset forfeiture programs of the </p>

<p> Departments of Justice and the Treasury. It describes the
progress </p>

<p> made in the management of seized and forfeited property since
our </p>

<p> December 1992 report. The value of seized property
inventories has </p>

<p> grown from a reported $33 million in 1979 to almost $2
billion in </p>

<p> 1994. Over the years, Justice and Treasury have transformed
their </p>

<p> problem-ridden seized property programs into more
businesslike </p>

<p> operations. However, some significant problems remain with
seized </p>

<p> property management. In recent years, interest in the asset </p>

<p> forfeiture programs has extended beyond property management
to </p>

<p> questioning whether forfeiture laws are applied appropriately
and </p>

<p> effectively and consideration of how forfeiture proceeds
should be </p>

<p> used. This report focuses on the most recent program changes
made </p>

<p> and highlights areas needing sustained management attention. </p>

<p> Copies of this report series are being sent to the President,
the </p>

<p> Republican and Democratic leadership of the Congress,
congressional </p>

<p> committee chairs and ranking minority members, all other
members of </p>

<p> the Congress, the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget, </p>

<p> the Attorney General, and the Secretary of the Treasury. </p>

<p> Charles A. Bowsher </p>

<p> Comptroller General </p>

<p> of the United States </p>

<p> OVERVIEW </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 0 </p>

<p> For more than 200 years, the federal government has had the
authority </p>

<p> to take property through forfeiture. Beginning about 1980,
the </p>

<p> number and value of seizures started growing dramatically as
law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies began relying more heavily on forfeiture
to </p>

<p> fight drug traffickers and other organized crime figures. The
</p>

<p> Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 expanded the
government's </p>

<p> seizure authority and established forfeiture funds within the
</p>

<p> departments of Justice and the Treasury.\1 Recently, asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> laws were expanded to cover crimes associated with money
laundering </p>

<p> and certain financial institutions-related offenses.
Collectively, </p>

<p> enforcement actions associated with these changes have
resulted in </p>

<p> the value of Justice's and Treasury's seized property
inventories </p>

<p> growing from a reported $33 million in 1979 to almost $2
billion in </p>

<p> 1994. </p>

<p> THE PROBLEM </p>

<p> As asset forfeiture programs grew in the 1980s, our attention
was </p>

<p> focused primarily on the management of seized and forfeited
property. </p>

<p> We found that property was not being properly cared for after
it was </p>

<p> seized, resulting in lost revenue to the government when the
property </p>

<p> was sold. Much has been accomplished in this area since the
1980s. </p>

<p> However, some significant problems remain with seized
property </p>

<p> management, and continued oversight is necessary. Also, the </p>

<p> departments of Justice and the Treasury continue to operate
two </p>

<p> similar but separate seized asset management and disposal
programs </p>

<p> without plans for consolidation, despite legislation
requiring them </p>

<p> to develop a plan to consolidate postseizure administration
of </p>

<p> certain properties.\2 </p>

<p> In recent years, interest in the asset forfeiture programs
has </p>

<p> extended beyond asset management to questioning whether
forfeiture </p>

<p> laws are applied appropriately and effectively and
consideration of </p>

<p> how forfeiture proceeds should be used. </p>

<p> PROGRESS </p>

<p> In our December 1992 high-risk report on asset forfeiture
programs, </p>

<p> we reported that major operational problems relating to the </p>

<p> management and disposition of seized and forfeited property
had been </p>

<p> identified and corrective actions were being initiated.
However, </p>

<p> although some management and systems changes have improved
program </p>

<p> operations, our recent audits of the Customs Service's fiscal
year </p>

<p> 1992 and 1993 financial statements revealed serious
weaknesses in key </p>

<p> internal controls and systems, which affected Customs'
ability to </p>

<p> control, manage, and report the results of its seizure
efforts, </p>

<p> including accountability and stewardship over property
seized. As a </p>

<p> result, tons of illegal drugs and millions of dollars in cash
and </p>

<p> other property have been vulnerable to theft and
misappropriation. </p>

<p> Customs recognizes the need for long-term and systematic </p>

<p> improvements, and its Commissioner established a senior
management </p>

<p> task force to review the seized property program in its
entirety. </p>

<p> Actions are being taken to address the internal control and
systems </p>

<p> problems; however, many of these efforts are in various
stages of </p>

<p> development. </p>

<p> Problems also persist with the Marshals Service's maintenance
and </p>

<p> disposal of seized and forfeited property, according to
recent </p>

<p> Department of Justice Office of Inspector General audit
reports. </p>

<p> These audits show the need for continued emphasis on and
vigilance </p>

<p> over seized property management. </p>

<p> We also reported in December 1992 that Justice and Treasury
were </p>

<p> pursuing an initiative for consolidating postseizure
management of </p>

<p> noncash seized property inventories. Legislation enacted in
1988 </p>

<p> required them to develop a plan to consolidate postseizure </p>

<p> administration of certain properties. Furthermore, in June
1991, we </p>

<p> identified substantial savings that could be realized through
merging </p>

<p> postseizure noncash property management functions. Although a
small </p>

<p> scale pilot project for consolidation was in effect from
October 1992 </p>

<p> through September 1993, no significant progress has been made
toward </p>

<p> consolidation. Since eliminating duplicate programs is one of
the </p>

<p> Vice President's National Performance Review goals, Justice
and </p>

<p> Treasury should aggressively pursue options for efficiency
gains </p>

<p> through program consolidation. </p>

<p> Our December 1992 high-risk report also highlighted growing
interest </p>

<p> in the forfeiture programs regarding the appropriate
application of </p>

<p> the asset forfeiture laws. In 1993, the Supreme Court issued
three </p>

<p> decisions that more clearly define the appropriate use of
asset </p>

<p> forfeiture authority. Also, several bills were proposed in
the last </p>

<p> Congress to put tighter controls on forfeiture. The
departments of </p>

<p> Justice and the Treasury have each taken several actions in
an effort </p>

<p> to strengthen the integrity of the asset forfeiture program, </p>

<p> including implementing new policy guidance intended to ensure
that </p>

<p> law enforcement agencies do not become overzealous in their
use of </p>

<p> the asset forfeiture laws or become too dependent on the
funds </p>

<p> derived from seizures. </p>

<p> OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE </p>

<p> The two agencies with custodial responsibilities for seized
property, </p>

<p> the Marshals Service for Justice and the Customs Service for </p>

<p> Treasury, have made improvements in seized property
management and </p>

<p> disposition over the years. However, significant problems
remain and </p>

<p> continued oversight is necessary to ensure policies and
procedures </p>

<p> are followed and adequate safeguards are in place. In
addition, </p>

<p> Justice and Treasury should aggressively pursue options for </p>

<p> efficiency gains through program consolidation. We will
continue to </p>

<p> monitor seized property management activities. </p>

<p> Much attention has been focused on the appropriate
application of the </p>

<p> asset forfeiture laws. It is too soon to tell whether the
recent </p>

<p> actions taken by Justice and Treasury will provide sufficient
</p>

<p> safeguards against improper seizures. Ensuring that adequate </p>

<p> safeguards are in place and adhered to will require
considerable </p>

<p> forfeiture program management attention and oversight in the
future. </p>

<p> -------------------- </p>

<p> \1 The funds were originally created within the Department of
Justice </p>

<p> and U.S. Customs Service. The Congress established the
Department </p>

<p> of the Treasury Forfeiture Fund in October 1992 to supersede
the </p>

<p> Customs Fund. </p>

<p> \2 The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Public Law No. 100-690,
21 </p>

<p> U.S.C. 887 (1988). </p>

<p> BACKGROUND </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 1 </p>

<p> Asset forfeiture programs were intended to (1) punish and
deter </p>

<p> criminal activity by depriving criminals of property used or
acquired </p>

<p> through illegal activities and (2) make seized property
available as </p>

<p> assets to strengthen law enforcement. Seized and forfeited
property </p>

<p> can be cash, bank accounts, automobiles, boats, airplanes,
jewelry, </p>

<p> art objects, or real estate. Justice and Treasury also seize </p>

<p> thousands of tons of illegal drugs and counterfeit items that
have no </p>

<p> resale value to the federal government. These items are
typically </p>

<p> held by the agencies until they are approved for destruction.
</p>

<p> Although the government has had forfeiture authority for over
200 </p>

<p> years, it was rarely utilized as a law enforcement tool until
the </p>

<p> 1980s. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 expanded </p>

<p> forfeiture authority and established asset forfeiture funds
within </p>

<p> the Department of Justice and the U.S. Customs Service to
hold the </p>

<p> proceeds of forfeitures and to finance program-related
expenses (for </p>

<p> example, property management expenses) as well as certain law
</p>

<p> enforcement activities, such as the payment of rewards for </p>

<p> information related to asset seizure and training directly
related to </p>

<p> the asset forfeiture program. </p>

<p> Until recently, Treasury law enforcement agencies other than
Customs </p>

<p> (the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; Criminal
Investigation </p>

<p> Division of the Internal Revenue Service; and the U.S. Secret
</p>

<p> Service) participated in the Justice Fund. In October 1992,
the </p>

<p> Congress created the Treasury Forfeiture Fund to supersede
the </p>

<p> Customs Fund.\3 The Treasury agencies that previously
participated in </p>

<p> the Justice Fund began making deposits into the Treasury Fund
in </p>

<p> October 1993. Figure 1 shows the two fund receipts for the
years </p>

<p> they have been in operation. </p>

<p> Figure 1: Forfeiture Fund </p>

<p> Receipts, Fiscal Years 1985 </p>

<p> Through 1994 </p>

<p> (See figure in printed </p>

<p> edition.) </p>

<p> Sources: Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury,
and U.S. </p>

<p> Customs Service. </p>

<p> These funds have always collected more than the allowable
expenses </p>

<p> that could be charged against them.\4 Year-end surpluses in
the </p>

<p> Justice Fund have historically been used for law enforcement </p>

<p> purposes, such as building prisons, hiring U.S. Attorney
office </p>

<p> personnel, or funding special activities through the Office
of </p>

<p> National Drug Control Policy. Year-end surpluses in the
Customs Fund </p>

<p> were transferred to the general fund of the Treasury.
Beginning in </p>

<p> fiscal year 1995, the year-end surpluses in the Treasury
Forfeiture </p>

<p> Fund will be available to the Secretary of the Treasury for
any law </p>

<p> enforcement activity of a federal agency. </p>

<p> Asset forfeiture legislation authorizes Justice and Treasury
to share </p>

<p> forfeiture proceeds with state and local law enforcement
agencies and </p>

<p> foreign governments that participate in law enforcement
efforts </p>

<p> leading to seizure and forfeiture. From fiscal years 1986
through </p>

<p> 1994, Justice and Treasury shared over $1.4 billion and $394
million, </p>

<p> respectively, in forfeited property and cash with over 3,000
state </p>

<p> and local law enforcement agencies. </p>

<p> As the forfeiture programs grew in the 1980s, Justice and
Customs </p>

<p> experienced significant problems with asset management and </p>

<p> disposition. However, as the programs matured, the agencies
gained </p>

<p> more control of them. Improvements made in the areas of
seized </p>

<p> property management and management information systems were
discussed </p>

<p> in our December 1992 high-risk report. For example, in 1987
Justice </p>

<p> and Customs established policies designed to minimize the
unnecessary </p>

<p> holding of seized cash. Also, legislation enacted in 1990
subjects </p>

<p> the funds to annual financial audits. These audits have been
done </p>

<p> each year since 1990. However, problems remain with property </p>

<p> management and, therefore, continual oversight is necessary.
One </p>

<p> issue that still has not been resolved is the consolidation
of </p>

<p> Justice's and Treasury's seized property management
functions. </p>

and </p>

<p> benefits of seizing agents which are borne by the seizing
agency. </p>

<p> PROGRESS AND CONTINUING CONCERNS </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 2 </p>

<p> In December 1992, we reported on the status of the asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> programs and progress made as well as emerging issues. The
following </p>

<p> examples describe the progress that has been made since that
time, </p>

<p> and the key continuing concerns. </p>

<p> SEIZED PROPERTY MANAGEMENT </p>

<p> PROBLEMS REMAIN </p>

<p> Our fiscal year 1992 and 1993 financial statement audits of
the U.S. </p>

<p> Customs Service revealed inadequate safeguards over, and
incomplete </p>

<p> and inaccurate accounting and reporting of, seized property.
Customs </p>

<p> is taking steps to address these problems; however, these
efforts are </p>

<p> in various stages of development. </p>

<p> Customs conducted its first nationwide physical inventory of
seized </p>

<p> property, drugs, and currency in February 1994. As a result
of this </p>

<p> inventory, Customs was able to identify and correct many
significant </p>

<p> errors in the recorded quantities and values of seized
property. </p>

<p> This effort was also intended to establish an accurate
baseline for </p>

<p> monitoring and reporting activity that results from Customs' </p>

<p> enforcement efforts. However, some Customs locations did not </p>

<p> effectively perform all of the inventory procedures. As a
result, </p>

<p> reported seized property balances included erroneous values. </p>

<p> Customs has also undertaken significant efforts to strengthen
</p>

<p> safeguards at its storage locations. Specifically, it has
performed </p>

<p> a study and evaluation of the adequacy of its physical
safeguards </p>

<p> over seized property and currency at 21 medium-to-high volume
storage </p>

<p> facilities. In addition, Customs constructed new facilities
in two </p>

<p> districts and has plans for renovation at other facilities. </p>

<p> While these efforts are commendable, Customs must establish
and </p>

<p> implement additional policies and procedures, such as
periodically </p>

<p> summarizing and assessing the results of its seizure efforts
for a </p>

<p> period of time, and make significant enhancements to its
seized </p>

<p> property tracking system to ensure proper accountability for
and </p>

<p> stewardship over seized property. In addition, a significant
and </p>

<p> sustained effort by Customs management will be required to
ensure </p>

<p> that established policies and procedures and planned
improvements are </p>

<p> properly implemented. Otherwise, Customs' ability to report
reliable </p>

<p> financial information and effectively carry out its seizure
program </p>

<p> will continue to be diminished. Also, tons of illegal drugs
and </p>

<p> millions of dollars in currency and other property will
remain </p>

<p> vulnerable to theft and misappropriation. </p>

<p> Problems also persist with the Marshals Service's maintenance
and </p>

<p> disposal of seized and forfeited property, according to
recent </p>

<p> Justice Department Office of Inspector General reports. In
March </p>

<p> 1993, the Inspector General reported mismanagement by
contractors </p>

<p> hired by the Marshals Service to maintain and dispose of
property, </p>

<p> resulting in excessive costs and lost revenues of almost $2.8
million </p>

<p> in six districts. Two and a half million dollars of the
excessive </p>

<p> costs and lost revenue resulted from a lack of effective
Marshals </p>

<p> Service oversight of real property management contracts. For </p>

<p> example, the Marshals Service failed to detect improper
payments for </p>

<p> property taxes, attorney fees, and title insurance. In March
1994, </p>

<p> the Inspector General reported that the Marshals Service was
not </p>

<p> disposing of forfeited property expeditiously, allowing
property to </p>

<p> deteriorate, thus resulting in lost revenue. The Marshals
Service </p>

<p> has initiated various actions to address these problems, such
as </p>

<p> revising procurement policies, conducting contract management
reviews </p>

<p> at certain districts, and providing additional training to
seized </p>

<p> assets management staff, according to the Inspector General. </p>

<p> PROPERTY MANAGEMENT CONSOLIDATION </p>

<p> EFFORTS UNSUCCESSFUL </p>

<p> In an effort to address duplication of effort, one of the
provisions </p>

<p> of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 required the Attorney
General and </p>

<p> the Secretary of the Treasury to develop and maintain a joint
plan to </p>

<p> coordinate and consolidate postseizure administration of
property </p>

<p> seized for drug-related offenses. In June 1991, we
recommended </p>

<p> consolidating the management and disposition of all noncash
seized </p>

<p> properties, designating the Marshals Service as the
custodian. We </p>

<p> estimated program administration costs could be reduced 11
percent </p>

<p> annually if Justice and Customs consolidated the postseizure </p>

<p> management and disposition of such items. We also reported
that </p>

<p> consolidation would likely result in lower contractor costs
due to </p>

<p> economies of scale. </p>

<p> Consolidation efforts to date have been unsuccessful. The
Marshals </p>

<p> Service and Customs entered into a memorandum of
understanding in </p>

<p> October 1992 for a 1-year small scale pilot consolidation
project </p>

<p> whereby the Marshals Service managed and disposed of Customs'
real </p>

<p> property and Customs managed and disposed of vessels for the
Marshals </p>

<p> Service at four districts. A total of 52 properties were
involved in </p>

<p> the pilot project, which dissolved at the end of the 1-year
period. </p>

<p> No cost analysis or evaluation of the effectiveness of the
project </p>

<p> was done. There are no future plans for consolidation of
asset </p>

<p> management and disposition functions at this time. </p>

<p> We still believe that consolidation of asset management and </p>

<p> disposition functions makes sense. Both agencies seize
similar types </p>

<p> of property that is generally located in the same geographic
areas. </p>

<p> However, under the current operating structure, each agency
maintains </p>

<p> a separate and distinct program for managing and disposing of
its </p>

<p> property. Justice, through the Marshals Service, contracts
directly </p>

<p> with vendors that provide the service. Treasury, through the
Customs </p>

<p> Service, has a nationwide contractor that provides custodial
services </p>

<p> either directly or through subcontracts with other vendors. </p>

<p> DUPLICATE ASSET FORFEITURE FUNDS </p>

<p> AND PROGRAMS </p>

<p> We see areas of possible duplication between the two funds
and </p>

<p> programs that extend beyond property management and
disposition </p>

<p> activities, to include forfeiture fund administration and
management. </p>

<p> The Treasury Forfeiture Fund structure essentially mirrors
that of </p>

<p> the Justice Fund. Both funds have their own management,
operations </p>

<p> staff, custodial agencies (Marshals Service and Customs), and
</p>

<p> contractors to maintain and dispose of property. The funds
work </p>

<p> closely together to develop policies that minimize variations
in </p>

<p> forfeiture procedures and operations. Although the funds
coordinate </p>

<p> closely, the existence of two separate funds has the
potential for </p>

<p> unnecessary duplication. For example, each department
recently </p>

<p> issued its own set of very similar program guidance. </p>

<p> On the other hand, Justice and Treasury are pursuing
consolidation of </p>

<p> asset tracking systems. Both departments have agreed to
develop, </p>

<p> implement, manage, operate, enhance, and support a
Consolidated Asset </p>

<p> Tracking System (CATS). CATS is intended to be the primary
automated </p>

<p> system for asset tracking and management used by all agencies
</p>

<p> participating in both the Justice and Treasury asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> programs. </p>

<p> CATS would make it possible to track the entire life cycle of
an </p>

<p> asset from seizure, through forfeiture, to disposal. The
system </p>

<p> would avoid the duplicate data entry that occurs due to the
various </p>

<p> participating components having incompatible systems. With
all </p>

<p> participating agencies using the same system, any user of
CATS would </p>

<p> have available the current status and processing details for
any </p>

<p> asset, regardless of which agency entered the information.
CATS is </p>

<p> being pilot tested, with participation from all Justice and
Treasury </p>

<p> agencies, except Customs. Customs plans to begin looking at
the </p>

<p> feasibility of CATS participation in the near future. The
success of </p>

<p> a single automated tracking system is dependent on the
participation </p>

<p> of all agencies, including Customs. We encourage Justice and </p>

<p> Treasury to continue to identify areas of duplication and
pursue </p>

<p> options for consolidation, such as their efforts with CATS. </p>

<p> IMPROVED GUIDANCE FOR THE USE OF </p>

<p> SHARED ASSETS </p>

<p> Continuing this consolidation theme, in July 1992 we
concluded that </p>

<p> because state and local law enforcement agencies often see
the </p>

<p> Justice and Customs asset sharing programs as one, the
programs </p>

<p> should have the same guidelines, with the same
interpretations of </p>

<p> appropriate asset use. Officials in some state and local
agencies </p>

<p> found the guidance vague and confusing, with Justice and
Customs </p>

<p> allowing different uses of shared proceeds despite having
similar </p>

<p> program policies. We recommended that Justice and Customs
issue </p>

<p> joint guidelines for asset sharing with clear, specific
definitions </p>

<p> for concepts such as &quot;law enforcement purposes&quot; and
&quot;supplanting of </p>

<p> resources.&quot; </p>

<p> Joint guidelines have not been issued. However, Treasury and
Justice </p>

<p> issued separate sets of revised and mutually agreeable asset
sharing </p>

<p> guidance in October 1993 and March 1994, respectively. The
clarified </p>

<p> guidance is intended to significantly reduce state and local
law </p>

<p> enforcement agency confusion about appropriate uses of shared
assets </p>

<p> and should lead to fewer improper uses of assets. </p>

<p> EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN SAFEGUARDS </p>

<p> AGAINST IMPROPER SEIZURES </p>

<p> As discussed in our 1992 high-risk report, increasing
concerns have </p>

<p> been voiced by Members of Congress, the media, and law
enforcement </p>

<p> officials about the potential for abuse of the property
interests of </p>

<p> innocent owners and third parties in the asset
seizure/forfeiture </p>

<p> process. Because revenue generation is one of the clearly </p>

<p> articulated goals of the forfeiture program, concerns have
also been </p>

<p> expressed that law enforcement agencies may have a vested
interest in </p>

<p> receiving the proceeds of forfeitures and that this interest
could </p>

<p> influence law enforcement priorities. </p>

<p> Furthermore, in 1993 the Supreme Court issued three decisions
that </p>

<p> have more clearly defined the appropriate use of asset
seizure and </p>

<p> forfeiture authority. For example, in Austin v. United
States, 113 </p>

<p> S. Ct. 2801 (1993), the Court concluded that the challenged </p>

<p> forfeiture constituted punishment and thus was subject to the
</p>

<p> limitations of the excessive fines clause of the Eighth
Amendment to </p>

<p> the Constitution. The Eighth Amendment ban on excessive fines
</p>

<p> requires that there be a relationship between the seriousness
of an </p>

<p> offense and the property that is taken. </p>

<p> Several bills were proposed in the last Congress that would
have </p>

<p> significantly affected the forfeiture programs. For example,
one </p>

<p> bill mandated that certain forfeiture proceedings be
conducted only </p>

<p> upon the conviction of the property owner for the relevant
crime. </p>

<p> That bill also required that a portion of the forfeiture
proceeds be </p>

<p> used for community based crime control programs. </p>

<p> The Department of Justice is also concerned about any
appearance of </p>

<p> conflict of interest or overzealous use of seizure and
forfeiture </p>

<p> laws. Justice has taken several actions to address these
concerns. </p>

<p> To provide leadership to state and local law enforcement
agencies, </p>

<p> Justice issued a National Code of Professional Conduct for
Asset </p>

<p> Forfeiture officials. Justice also initiated a project to
coordinate </p>

<p> and expand federal forfeiture training in an effort to ensure
that </p>

<p> state and local law enforcement agencies are in full
compliance with </p>

<p> constitutional and statutory limitations on seizure and
forfeiture. </p>

<p> The departments of Justice and the Treasury have implemented
new </p>

<p> policy guidance to strengthen the integrity of the asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> program. For example, to minimize any adverse effects of
forfeiture </p>

<p> on innocent persons, Justice and Treasury issued new policies
and </p>

<p> procedures that require expedited notice to owners of seized
property </p>

<p> and payments to lienholders. Justice also proposed
regulations in </p>

<p> June 1994 that would clarify when innocent persons whose
property is </p>

<p> used by others for criminal purposes are entitled to relief. </p>

<p> FURTHER ACTION NEEDED </p>

<p> ============================================================
Chapter 3 </p>

<p> The asset forfeiture programs continue to remain highly
visible, as </p>

<p> evidenced by the recent policy guidance and proposed
regulations as </p>

<p> well as numerous proposed changes to forfeiture legislation.
Justice </p>

<p> and Treasury have made many improvements to their asset
forfeiture </p>

<p> programs over the years. However, enhancements to seized
property </p>

<p> tracking systems and development and implementation of
additional </p>

<p> policies and procedures are needed to help ensure adequate </p>

<p> accountability and stewardship over seized property. In
addition, </p>

<p> continued oversight will be required to ensure that existing
policies </p>

<p> and procedures and planned improvement efforts are properly </p>

<p> implemented. We will continue to monitor seized property
management </p>

<p> activities. </p>

<p> Possible duplication of resources within the two forfeiture
funds and </p>

<p> programs is of particular interest in light of budget
constraints. </p>

<p> Justice and Treasury should aggressively pursue options for </p>

<p> efficiency gains through consolidation. </p>

<p> Although significant problems remain with seized property
management, </p>

<p> some of the attention has shifted toward concerns about law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies becoming overzealous in their use of the
asset </p>

<p> forfeiture laws or too dependent on the funds derived from
such </p>

<p> seizures. It is too soon to judge the effectiveness of the
recent </p>

<p> efforts taken by Justice and Treasury to strengthen
safeguards </p>

<p> against improper seizures. Our future work will include
keeping </p>

<p> abreast of these efforts and assessing any future legislative
</p>

<p> changes. </p>
