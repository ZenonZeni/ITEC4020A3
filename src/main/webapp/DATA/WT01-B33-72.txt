<p>The Libertarian Party asks: </p>

<p>SHOULD WE RE-LEGALIZE DRUGS? </p>

<p>* Should We Re-Legalize Drugs? </p>

<p>Libertarians, like most Americans, demand to be safe at home
and on the streets. Libertarians would like all Americans to be
healthy and free of drug dependence. But drug laws don't help,
they make things worse. </p>

<p>The professional politicians scramble to make names for
themselves as tough anti-drug warriors, while the experts agree
that the &quot;war on drugs&quot; has been lost, and could never
be won. The tragic victims of that war are your personal liberty
and its companion, responsibility. </p>

<p>It's time to consider the re-legalization of drugs. </p>

<p>* The Lessons of Prohibition </p>

<p>In the 1920's, alcohol was made illegal by Prohibition. The
result: Organized Crime. Criminals jumped at the chance to supply
the demand for liquor. The streets became battlegrounds. The
criminals bought off law enforcement and judges. Adulterated
booze blinded and killed people. Civil rights were trampled in
the hopeless attempt to keep people from drinking. </p>

<p>When the American people saw what Prohibition was doing to
them, they supported its repeal. When they succeeded, most states
legalized liquor and the criminal gangs were out of the liquor
business. Today's war on drugs is a re-run of Prohibition.
Approximately 40 million Americans are occasional, peaceful users
of some illegal drug who are no threat to anyone. They are not
going to stop. The laws don't, and can't, stop drug use. </p>

<p>* Organized Crime Profits </p>

<p>Whenever there is a great demand for a product and government
makes it illegal, a black market always appears to supply the
demand. The price of the product rises dramatically and the
opportunity for huge profits is obvious. The criminal gangs love
the situation, making millions. They kill other drug dealers,
along with innocent people caught in the crossfire, to protect
their territory. They corrupt police and courts. Pushers sell
adulterated dope and experimental drugs, causing injury and
death. And because drugs are illegal, their victims have no
recourse. </p>

<p>* Crime Increases </p>

<p>Half the cost of law enforcement and prisons is squandered on
drug related crime. Of all drug users, a relative few are addicts
who commit crimes daily to supply artificially expensive habits.
They are the robbers, car thieves and burglars who make our homes
and streets unsafe. </p>

<p>* An American Police State </p>

<p>Civil liberties suffer. We are all &quot;suspects&quot;,
subject to random urine tests, highway check points and spying
into our personal finances. Your property can be seized without
trial, if the police merely claim you got it with drug profits.
Doing business with cash makes you a suspect. America is becoming
a police state because of the war on drugs. </p>

<p>* America Can Handle Legal Drugs </p>

<p>Today's illegal drugs were legal before 1914. Cocaine was even
found in the original Coca-Cola recipe. Americans had few
problems with cocaine, opium, heroin or marijuana. Drugs were
inexpensive; crime was low. Most users handled their drug of
choice and lived normal, productive lives. Addicts out of control
were a tiny minority. </p>

<p>The first laws prohibiting drugs were racist in origin -- to
prevent Chinese laborers from using opium and to prevent blacks
and Hispanics from using cocaine and marijuana. That was unjust
and unfair, just as it is unjust and unfair to make criminals of
peaceful drug users today. </p>

<p>Some Americans will always use alcohol, tobacco, marijuana or
other drugs. Most are not addicts, they are social drinkers or
occasional users. Legal drugs would be inexpensive, so even
addicts could support their habits with honest work, rather than
by crime. Organized crime would be deprived of its profits. The
police could return to protecting us from real criminals; and
there would be room enough in existing prisons for them. </p>

<p>* Try Personal Responsibility </p>

<p>It's time to re-legalize drugs and let people take
responsibility for themselves. Drug abuse is a tragedy and a
sickness. Criminal laws only drive the problem underground and
put money in the pockets of the criminal class. With drugs legal,
compassionate people could do more to educate and rehabilitate
drug users who seek help. Drugs should be legal. Individuals have
the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies,
so long as they take responsibility for their actions. </p>

<p>From the Mayor of Baltimore, Kurt Schmoke, to conservative
writer and TV personality, William F. Buckley, Jr., leading
Americans are now calling for repeal of America's repressive and
ineffective drug laws. The Libertarian Party urges you to join in
this effort to make our streets safer and our liberties more
secure. </p>
