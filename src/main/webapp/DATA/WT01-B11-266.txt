<UL>
<LI>The government money market yield curve (yields on securities with maturities of up to 1 year) flattened during the fourth quarter -- yields on 3 and 6-month Treasury bills rose, while the yield on 1-year bills declined by 20 basis points.
<LI>During the quarter, short agency paper continued to be attractively valued versus Treasury bills, offering a yield pick up in excess of 20 basis points.
<LI>Overnight government repurchase rates were relatively high during December, trading near the Federal Funds rate.  This was particularly so on the last day of the year, when year-end borrowing pressures forced overnight repurchase rates above 7%.
<LI>During the quarter, we shortened the Fund's average maturity and built liquidity because we often experience redemptions during December.  This did not negatively impact the Fund's yield, however, because repurchase rates were as high as they were.
