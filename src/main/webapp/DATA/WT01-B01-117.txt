<BR>
Lewis Thomas, the biologist and essayist, speculated that the reason we Cro-Magnons got rid of the 
Neanderthals is that we could not bear their silence. His observation says as much 
about speech as about the absence of speech--that once people began to use words to 
express themselves, there could be no turning back, no anti-evolutionary tendency that 
would have us keep quiet again. Words are weapons against oblivion. If the species 
were ever to revert to silence, that silence would be deafening, because everyone 
would remember the time that we made a sound.<BR>
<BR>
Journalism, at its best, sides with the Cro-Magnons. A tyrannical, oppressive government 
or group, having established silence somewhere, seeks to keep the unnatural peace 
by means of censorship, intimidation and murder; and the journalist seeks to break 
the silence with the truth. Their respective forces are ill-balanced; one side has 
guns, the other words. It is amazing to consider that, historically, the words have 
prevailed.<BR>
<BR>
I do not mean to accord any special nobility to journalists as people. By speaking 
out, or writing out, they are simply doing their jobs. It is where they do these 
jobs that sets certain journalists apart. Many American journalists drop in on dangerous 
places like Bosnia or Rwanda, stay a few weeks and go home. For most of the people in 
whom the Committee to Protect Journalists is interested, the dangerous places are 
home.<BR>
<BR>
They do not think of themselves as remarkable, so their colleagues in safer places 
must do that for them. Yet the work of CPJ is not merely to honor such people with 
recognition. The International Press Freedom Awards, given every year to a few of 
the bravest, are both symbols of admiration and signals to the worlds in which they operate 
that the freer world is watching. This is what CPJ said presenting the 1995 International 
Press Freedom Awards to Yevgeny Kiselyov, whose independent television network is threatened in Russia; to investigative reporter Veronica Guerin, who has been beaten 
and shot in Ireland; to Jos&eacute; Rub&eacute;n Zamora Marroqu&iacute;n, who, as editor of an independent 
newspaper in Guatemala, is continually under fire; to Fred M'membe, editor of Zambia's most important independent paper, who faces criminal charges that could sentence 
him to prison for 100 years; and to Ahmad Taufik, president of Indonesia's sole independent 
journalists union, who is already in prison for expressing "feelings of hostility" toward the government. <BR>
<BR>
In 1995, 51 journalists were killed in the line of duty. Forty-five were murdered 
outright; and six were killed covering a war, or as a result of being in the wrong 
place at the wrong time. The silence of those killed is doubled by the silence that 
results from their killing. It is where the truth has been silenced that the silence of 
death is most painful--the silence of Cambodia, or of Auschwitz, or of Babi Yar; the 
silence, these days, of Sudan. <BR>
<BR>
In his great book, <CITE>Language and Silence, </CITE>
the English critic George Steiner wondered if anyone would have cared what Hitler 
did to the Jews if the Nazis had not ventured outside the borders of the Third Reich. 
"There would have been numerous pundits and journalists," wrote Steiner, "to assure 
us that rumors were exaggerated, that Dachau had pleasant walks." He assumed that journalists 
would be too stupid or corrupt to break the silence with the truth, and, from time 
to time, that has been the case.<BR>
<BR>
But today's journalists are a pretty honest lot, for the most part. And they have 
been encouraged by organizations like CPJ, which reassure them that if they make 
a sound, the world will listen. Steiner also said that there are some horrors too 
deep for words. That may be true for art, but not for journalism. The unwritten or unspoken 
report is good news for killers, and eventually it leaves a wasteland.<BR>
<BR>
The Committee to Protect Journalists did not create the journalists it seeks to protect. 
These people would tell their indispensable stories whether or not CPJ existed. And, 
in many if not most cases, CPJ cannot fulfill the promise of its own self-appointed mission. If the forces of silence want to do their dirty work, they will find a 
way, and then express ignorance of the event, or regret. <BR>
<BR>
But if CPJ did not cry out against such acts, who would make the noise? And if no 
one sounded the alarm, who would try to prevent the fire next time? Everywhere journalists 
work, someone strives to keep them quiet in the interest of silencing the world. 
People have come too far for that.<BR>

<A NAME="executive"><H2>Executive Summary</H2>
<STRONG>
</STRONG>
<CITE>Attacks on the Press in 1995</CITE>
 analyzes the state of press freedom in 101 countries last year and examines more 
than 700 individual cases of journalists who were physically attacked, imprisoned, 
threatened or censored in retaliation for their work. Drawn from the research of 
CPJ's in-house staff of regional media experts, CPJ's annual <CITE>Attacks on the Press</CITE>
 reports are widely recognized as the most comprehensive and authoritative source 
of information on press freedom violations around the world. <CITE><BR>
</CITE>
 <BR>

<H3>Major Findings</H3>
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>At the end of 1995, a record 182 journalists were imprisoned in 22 countries.</STRONG>
 For the second consecutive year,<STRONG> Turkey, </STRONG>with 51 reporters and editors in jail, was the worst offender. Other countries with 
large numbers of journalists in jail at the close of 1995 were <STRONG>Ethiopia</STRONG>
 (31), <STRONG>China</STRONG>
 (20) and <STRONG>Kuwait</STRONG>
 (18); <STRONG>Vietnam, Peru, Myanmar (Burma)</STRONG>
 and <STRONG>Nigeria </STRONG>
each held eight journalists in jail.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>51 journalists were killed in the line of duty in 1995.</STRONG>
 <STRONG>Forty-five of the deaths were homicides; six were casualties in combat zones</STRONG>
. For the second consecutive year, Algeria was the most deadly country for journalists--24 
were murdered in 1995 by rebel terrorists who have been waging a campaign of death 
against members of the media since May 1993. To date, more than 50 Algerian journalists have been assassinated.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>CPJ has now confirmed 456 cases of journalists who were killed in the past decade 
(1986-1995) as a direct result of their profession. Most were murdered.</STRONG>
 <STRONG>The countries with the highest death tolls were Algeria, the former Yugoslavia, Colombia, 
Tajikistan and the Philippines.</STRONG>
 In the report's introduction, CPJ Executive Director William A. Orme, Jr. examines 
how these cases dramatize new dangers facing journalists around the world.<BR>
<BR>
</UL>

<H3>Regional Trends</H3>
<STRONG>Africa</STRONG>
<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> For the third consecutive year, <STRONG>Ethiopia</STRONG>
 held more journalists in jail--31 at year's end--than any other country in Africa. 
Most were detained without charges. <BR>
<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>Rwanda</STRONG>
 and <STRONG>Burundi</STRONG>
 again proved to be among the most dangerous places on the continent for journalists 
to work, as local and foreign reporters were threatened and harassed by government 
security forces and armed insurgents.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Gen. Sani Abacha escalated his all-out war on <STRONG>Nigeria</STRONG>
's independent press, as exemplified by the secret trial and conviction in July of 
four journalists for their coverage of an abortive coup plot. <BR>
<BR>
<LI> Upcoming elections in several countries, including <STRONG>Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire), </STRONG><STRONG>Ethiopia</STRONG>
 and <STRONG>Chad, </STRONG>proved reason enough for governments to impose greater restrictions--if not all-out 
crackdowns--on the media.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Constitutional guarantees of press freedom failed to keep journalists in <STRONG>Kenya, </STRONG><STRONG>Zimbabwe</STRONG>
 and <STRONG>Zambia</STRONG>
 from being sent to jail for sedition, libel and defamation. In <STRONG>Sierra Leone</STRONG>
,<STRONG> Nigeria</STRONG>
 and the<STRONG> Gambia, </STRONG>military leaders overrode court rulings and suppressed unfavorable press coverage 
with executive decrees. <BR>
<BR>
</UL>
<STRONG>The Americas</STRONG>
<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> Attacks against journalists by drug cartels and other criminal organizations--many 
of them protected by elements of the local policy and military--were an escalating 
problem in <STRONG>Guatemala, </STRONG><STRONG>Colombia, </STRONG><STRONG>Mexico, </STRONG><STRONG>Brazil</STRONG>
 and <STRONG>Paraguay</STRONG>
. <BR>
<BR>
<LI> The democratically elected leaders of <STRONG>Argentina, </STRONG><STRONG>Chile</STRONG>
 and <STRONG>Peru</STRONG>
 introduced legislation restricting press freedoms; in Argentina and Chile, the initiatives 
were withdrawn following strong local and international media reactions.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> With the June release from prison of dissident journalist Yndamiro Restano, <STRONG>Cuba</STRONG>
 appeared to be softening its hostility toward independent local journalists. But 
in the second half of 1995, Cuba's fledgling nongovernmental news agencies were relentlessly 
harassed by state security forces. <BR>
<BR>
<LI> In <STRONG>Costa Rica, </STRONG>the Supreme Court declared the licensing of journalists unconstitutional, setting 
a possible precedent for other Latin American countries where the Costa Rican licensing 
system has been adopted or proposed.<BR>
<BR>
</UL>
<STRONG>Asia<BR>
</STRONG>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>China</STRONG>
 again jailed two of its most prominent dissident journalists, Wei Jingsheng and Chen 
Ziming, bringing the total number of journalists in jail to 20. Beijing also ordered 
the closure of two provincial TV stations for broadcasting politically objectionable material.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>Indonesia</STRONG>
 accelerated its crackdown on the independent press, imprisoning Ahmad Taufik, the 
leader of the country's only independent journalists union. Taufik, a winner of CPJ's 
1995 International Press Freedom Award, had his sentence <CITE>increased</CITE>
 on appeal, and is now serving out his three-year sentence in prison.<BR>
<LI> Criminal libel charges threatened the survival of several newspapers in <STRONG>Cambodia, </STRONG>where a new press law allows authorities to shut down newspapers for 30 days and 
bans news reports that affect "national security and political stability."<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Two of East Asia's emerging democracies, <STRONG>Taiwan</STRONG>
 and <STRONG>South Korea, </STRONG>showed notable press freedom gains in 1995. Taiwan licensed the country's first 
private, pro-opposition television station, and South Korea's press called former 
and current political leaders to account in a mushrooming corruption scandal.<BR>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
<LI> Press freedom<STRONG> </STRONG>
conditions deteriorated alarmingly in <STRONG>Pakistan, </STRONG>with a sharp increase in violent attacks on the media, police harassment, newspaper 
bans and defamation suits.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> In <STRONG>Sri Lanka, </STRONG>the People's Alliance government censored coverage of the war with Tamil separatists, 
introducing regulations three weeks before a major counterinsurgency offensive that 
required journalists to clear all war reports with the Media Ministry.<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
</UL>
<STRONG>Central Europe and the Republics of the Former Soviet Union<EM><BR>
</EM></STRONG>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> In <STRONG>Russia, </STRONG>the government's continuing failure to investigate and prosecute those responsible 
for the murders of seven journalists had a chilling effect on reporting about organized 
crime and official corruption.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> In <STRONG>Tajikistan, </STRONG>the execution-style murder of a BBC Persian Service bureau chief was a chilling 
reminder of the deadly campaign begun in 1992 against independent and opposition 
journalists, which left 27 dead.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Governments tightened controls over all news media in <STRONG>Uzbekistan</STRONG>
 and<STRONG> Turkmenistan</STRONG>
. In <STRONG>Azerbaijan</STRONG>
 and other nations of the Caucasus region, prior censorship was often employed to 
suppress independent reporting.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Journalists in <STRONG>Bosnia</STRONG>
 faced a high risk of being killed deliberately by snipers or accidentally by cross 
fire and land mines. The taking of journalists as hostages became a new method of 
retaliation against the international press by Bosnian Serb militias.<BR>

 increased by 24, accounting for more than half of all murders of journalists documented 
by CPJ in 1995.<BR>

<LI><STRONG> Turkey</STRONG>
 continued to jail more reporters and editors than any other country, with 51 journalists 
in prison at year's end.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Reporters in <STRONG>Egypt</STRONG>
 faced new restrictions as Law 93 of 1995--dubbed the "Press Assassination Law"--imposed 
steep fines and long prison terms for loosely defined libel offenses.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> In areas now under the control of the <STRONG>Palestinian National Authority, </STRONG>journalists were hit with arbitrary detention orders and newspapers were forced 
to suspend publication.<BR>

<STRONG>The 10-Year Death Toll: Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty<BR>
</STRONG>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
Between 1986 and 1995, 456 journalists were killed in 61 countries for reasons related 
directly to their profession, CPJ has confirmed. More than 300 of those deaths appeared 
to have been deliberate political assassinations. The countries with the highest death tolls illustrate the different kinds of threats now facing independent journalists 
around the world:<BR>
<BR>
<CITE>Silencing the press in the name of religion and politics</CITE>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>Algeria, 53 deaths:</STRONG>
 Reporters and editors in the press have been targeted for harassment, intimidation 
and murder by Islamist radicals.<BR>
<BR>
</UL>
<CITE>Targeting journalists in war zones</CITE>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>The former Yugoslavia, 45 deaths:</STRONG>
 The internationally accepted norm of treating reporters as civilian noncombatants 
is increasingly ignored by armed factions in civil wars. Reporters covering civil 
wars are now targeted by armed belligerents who perceive journalists to be the enemy.<BR>
<BR>
</UL>
<CITE>Contract murders of reporters covering drug trafficking <BR>
</CITE>
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>Colombia, 43 deaths:</STRONG>
 Drug cartels and organized crime syndicates are targeting journalists with growing 
frequency. In the coming decade, threats from such groups could well become an even 
more deadly problem than political persecution.<BR>
<BR>
</UL>
<CITE>Stamping out free expression in societies accustomed to tyranny</CITE>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>Tajikistan, 29 deaths:</STRONG>
 The return to totalitarianism in a country that had briefly embraced democracy was 
accompanied by a campaign of murder and censorship against a small corps of independent 
journalists.<BR>
<BR>
</UL>
<CITE>Reprisals for investigations of human rights abuses and corruption</CITE>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>The Philippines, 29 deaths:</STRONG>
 Though more common in the Marcos era, the murders of provincial reporters who uncovered 
human rights abuses and corruption continued through the Aquinos and Ramos governments 
as the restoration of democracy emboldened local publications to investigate such issues.<BR>
<BR>
</UL>

<H3>Special Reports</H3>
<CITE>Attacks on the Press in 1995</CITE>
 features insightful, in-depth commentaries on the jailing, murder and censorship 
of journalists in: <BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>Algeria:</STRONG>
 The brutal campaign of assassination against Algerian reporters has been difficult 
to stop in part because local journalists failed to join together and fight for legal 
protections when the government liberalized press controls in 1989, says editor S&eacute;lima Ghezali in her probing essay, "Algerian Journalism's Original Sin."<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>Russia:</STRONG>
 Russian journalists are being murdered in record numbers, but they can expect little 
or no protection from their government: That is the central conclusion of CPJ staff 
expert David Satter's special report on his fact-finding mission to Moscow to investigate seven unsolved killings of local journalists. Satter shows how the Yeltsin administration 
has failed even to investigate most of these cases. <BR>
<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>Nigeria:</STRONG>
 Since Nigeria's independence, the local press has labored under a series of increasingly 
repressive military regimes. An entire generation of journalists has fled. In "The 
Retreat of Nigeria's Press: Tactical Withdrawal or Temporary Defeat?" an exiled Nigerian journalist discusses the plight of journalists under Gen. Sani Abacha's rule 
and prospects for the restoration of democracy and press freedom.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>Palestinian National Authority:</STRONG>
 The growing ranks of independent Palestinian journalists insist that their job requires 
them to be skeptical--a stance that the Arafat government has trouble accepting. Palestinian 
journalist Imad Musa analyzes the challenges facing reporters in Gaza and the West Bank, many of whom have been subjected to harassment, censorship and arbitrary 
detention by PNA officials. <BR>
<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>Bosnia:</STRONG>
 In "Hunting for Mass Graves Behind Serb Lines," U.S. reporter David Rohde recounts 
the ordeal of being held prisoner for two weeks by Bosnian Serbs as he sought to 
continue his reporting on mass grave sites.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>India:</STRONG>
 In a groundbreaking report on the extraordinary pressures faced by journalists in 
embattled Indian-ruled Kashmir, CPJ's Asia program coordinator, Vikram Parekh, documents 
the murderous assaults and severe official constraints on local reporters and editors. Parekh found that the Kashmir press endures constant threats of closure, intimidation 
and armed attacks by one or more of the warring parties: armed separatists, Indian 
security forces and government-backed militias. <STRONG><BR>

<H3>CPJ Actions</H3>

<CITE>Attacks on the Press in 1995</CITE>
 shows how CPJ took action on behalf of hundreds of journalists last year. Through 
diplomatic channels, grassroots efforts and media campaigns, CPJ brought international 
attention to these cases and helped secure the release of prisoners. <BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI> In <STRONG>Cuba, </STRONG>dissident journalist <STRONG>Yndamiro Restano</STRONG>
 was released from prison last June, after a year-long international protest campaign

for her reports on Turkish counterinsurgency forays into Kurdish villages. Two months 
later, the charges against Marcus were dismissed. <BR>

<LI> <STRONG>David Rohde, </STRONG>a correspondent in <STRONG>Bosnia</STRONG>
 for the <CITE>Christian Science Monitor</CITE>

appeals by CPJ Chair Kati Marton to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.

<A NAME="Introduction"><H2>Introduction</H2></A>

by William A. Orme, Jr.<BR>
<BR>
On March 1, 1995, Vladislav Listyev, one of Russia's best-known news broadcasters, respected universally 
for his integrity and independence, came home from his new job as head of a national 
public television network. As he entered his Moscow apartment building, he was shot dead. <BR>
<BR>
Listyev's killing provoked a national outcry. He was the fourth Moscow journalist 
murdered in nine months, but he was by far the most famous. Thousands marched in 
his funeral procession, demanding that authorities find and punish his murderers. 
The Yeltsin government promised to make the Listyev homicide one of its highest priorities. 
<BR>
<BR>
The deep public anger and spontaneous demonstrations of support for press freedom 
provoked by Listyev's tragic killing were heartening to journalists in Russia and 
abroad. But a year later, there is still no sign of a serious government effort to 
identify and prosecute those responsible for the crime: no suspects held, no charges filed, 
no evidence of any serious ongoing investigation. <BR>
<BR>
As with all unsolved homicides, the motives for Listyev's murder remain unclear: a 
common supposition is that entrenched interests objected to his cancellation of lucrative 
advertising contracts and to his commitment to editorial autonomy. But the killing itself, and the government's failure to find and arrest suspects, sent a message 
to Russian journalists that any one of them, no matter how prominent, could be murdered 
with impunity. It was an unsettling reminder of the fragility of press freedom in 
Russia and many other nations where democratic rights have shallow roots.<BR>
<BR>
<CITE>New Freedoms Under Siege</CITE>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
<STRONG><BR>
</STRONG>
For most of the world, press freedom is an achievement of the late 20th century, the 
result (and often the catalyst) of democratic revolutions that ended both Soviet 
Communism and military rule by the anti-Communist right. <BR>
<BR>
The gains for journalists and journalism have been extraordinary. The ranks of independent 
reporters and news organizations working around the world have probably doubled in 
the past decade, and people from Moscow to Seoul to Soweto are getting uncensored information about national and world affairs for the first time in their lives. <BR>
<BR>
But the risks have increased commensurately as well. Almost everywhere, newly won 
freedoms are under siege. Journalists face violent reprisals from state security 
forces, from international drug gangs and from armed dissidents of diverse ideological 
stripes. Criminal libel suits and huge civil financial claims are filed by officials and 
their friends in an effort to frustrate coverage of government corruption. As 1995 
drew to a close, at least 182 journalists--a record--were held in jails around the 
world because local authorities disapproved of their reporting. And, in the most chilling 
statistic of all, at least 51 journalists were killed last year in the line of duty, 
most of them by political assassins. <BR>
<BR>
This annual report of the Committee to Protect Journalists chronicles these assaults 
on press freedom. They range in seriousness from incidents of censorship to, at the 
extreme, in Algeria, a systematic campaign of assassination against all members of 
the working press. <BR>
<BR>
In most cases, CPJ did more than document these abuses. We worked to get detained 
journalists out of jail, sent letters of protest to offending governments (and to 
nongovernmental offenders), alerted the international press to abuses against journalists, 
helped journalists fleeing persecution to find asylum, provided practical safety information 
to reporters assigned to dangerous areas and tried to persuade the U.S. and other 
governments to make the defense of press freedom a diplomatic priority. <BR>
<BR>
This pressure can be effective. In June, Cuban journalist Yndamiro Restano was released 
from prison following a six-month international protest campaign spearheaded by CPJ's 
Americas program. The timely and highly public intervention in Turkey of CPJ Honorary Chairman Walter Cronkite was instrumental, we believe, in the successful fight 
for an acquittal of Istanbul-based Reuter correspondent Aliza Marcus, who faced three 
years in prison in Turkey (where more journalists are incarcerated than anywhere 
in the world) just for reporting the undisputed truth about counterinsurgency strikes 
against Kurdish rebels. <CITE>Christian Science Monitor </CITE>
reporter David Rohde, taken into custody and held for trial in Serbian-controlled 
Bosnia, was released following CPJ Chair Kati Marton's direct and insistent appeals 
to Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic during the peace talks in Dayton, Ohio. <BR>
<BR>
But the bedrock of our work is the basic journalistic research evident throughout 
this volume: the timely, thoroughly sourced documentation of hundreds of cases of 
abuse, harassment and intimidation. CPJ staff experts confirm that each incident 
happened, that the victim was a legitimate working journalist, and that his or her professional 
activities appeared to be the only plausible reason for the attack. Given the strictness 
of our criteria and the difficulties of investigating cases in often-remote provinces that are also often in the throes of civil conflict, this catalogue of press 
freedom violations inevitably understates the dimensions of the problem. It remains, 
however, the most comprehensive survey of its kind. <BR>
<BR>
<CITE>Where the Press Is the Opposition<BR>
</CITE>
<CITE><BR>
</CITE>
Most of the 720 incidents itemized in this book took place in countries that offer 
neither the best nor the worst national examples of press freedom. Because of our 
limited resources, CPJ's press-monitoring work does not cover the industrial democracies. 
Our work on behalf of the major Western news organizations is largely limited to the 
problems faced by foreign correspondents in civil conflicts and combat zones. We 
focus on countries where local journalists are most in need of international support 
(which also tend to be the countries where foreign correspondents get into trouble). Conspicuously 
missing from that list are the countries with the most severe press freedom problems 
of all--nations such as North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan and Myanmar, where there is no independent local press, and where access by foreign reporters 
is often also restricted. Though these countries are cited in our reports, there 
are few attacks on journalists in places where there are few or no journalists. <BR>
<BR>
The real battle for press freedom is being waged in societies that have only recently 
emerged from autocratic repression--places as culturally and politically diverse as 
Argentina, Russia and Cambodia. Such countries let independent publications circulate 
freely, but rarely investigate--much less prosecute--violent attacks against reporters, 
editors and publishers. Compounding the problem, many governments view the independent 
press as the de facto opposition, a perception with considerable basis in fact. In places where well-organized political parties are either a new phenomenon (as in 
Central Europe) or are widely dismissed as ineffectual and corrupt (as in much of 
Latin America), the daily press is often the only institution holding government 
officials accountable. <BR>
<BR>
Even when journalists are targeted by the government's declared enemies--armed separatists, 
nationalist zealots, drug traffickers--the chilling effect is sometimes quietly welcomed 
by those with the power to combat these crimes. A frightened reporter is rarely an aggressive reporter. <BR>
<BR>
<CITE>The Ultimate Censorship: Assassination<BR>
</CITE>
<CITE><BR>
</CITE>
Ideologies of both the left and right remain a threat to independent journalism. During 
the Cold War, censorship was imposed in the name of Marx. Today it is often rationalized 
by invoking Confucius or Muhammad. The religious pretext cuts both ways: In countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, rulers cite their Muslim faith to justify tight 
controls on the news media; in Egypt and Uzbekistan, authorities say such strictures 
are essential to the containment of Islamic fundamentalism. In the 1970s, Argentine generals murdered nearly 100 reporters and editors in a crusade in defense of what 
they termed Christian values. In the 1990s, Algerian insurgents have assassinated 
more than 50 reporters and editors as part of their campaign for theocratic Islamist 
rule.<BR>
<BR>
Assassination is the ultimate form of censorship. CPJ confirmed 51 cases of journalists 
who were killed in the line of duty in 1995. Nearly half--24 in all--were Algerian 
reporters and editors murdered by the Armed Islamic Group and allied rebel factions, 
making Algeria the most dangerous country in the world for journalists for the second 
consecutive year. Since CPJ was founded in 1981, we have never witnessed a sustained 
campaign of terror against journalists on this scale. <BR>
<BR>
Six of the confirmed deaths last year--two in Chechnya and one each in Azerbaijan, 
Burundi, Croatia and Somalia--were combat-zone casualties. (Another four journalists 
who are missing in Chechnya are feared dead, but searches continue.) The other 45 
cases appear to have been politically motivated homicides. CPJ is investigating another five 
deaths of journalists in 1995 that also appear to have been deliberate murders.<BR>

Murder was the leading cause of job-related deaths for journalists in 1995, as it 
has been consistently for at least the past decade. Since 1986, CPJ has documented 
<A HREF="#456 Killed">456 violent deaths of journalists</a>. More than 300 appear to have been 
deliberate political assassinations; the rest were apparently accidental deaths among foreign 
correspondents and local reporters covering armed combat and violent civil disturbances. 
In such countries as Bosnia and Somalia, however, even many such combat-zone casualties may have been deliberate sniper attacks on clearly identifiable journalists.<BR>
<BR>
The homicide rate among journalists is not, it should be stressed, the most accurate 
inversely correlating index of press freedom. In the most repressive societies, murders 
of journalists are extremely rare, because journalists are extremely rare. In the 
past decade CPJ has not had a single confirmed killing of a working reporter in North 
Korea, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Libya, Syria or Myanmar. Conversely, in countries with 
a large and aggressive press corps, there are abundant motives and opportunities 
for violent attacks on journalists; India, where 15 reporters were killed in the past 10 
years, and Brazil, with 10 murders since 1986, are cases in point. And there are 
many countries, such as China, Ethiopia, Syria and Kuwait, where journalists are 
rarely killed, but are routinely imprisoned, often for near-life terms. <BR>
<BR>
A close look at the countries where these killings are most common offers a disturbingly 
representative portrait of the dangers faced by journalists today. Algeria, the most 
extreme case, with 53 journalists killed (all murders, and all since May 1993), is unique in scale but not in kind. Reporters and editors of the "secular" press are 
targeted for harassment and sometimes murder by Islamist radicals in Egypt and Turkey 
as well. <BR>
<BR>
It is unsurprising that the former Yugoslavia, in aggregate, had the second-largest 
number of press casualties in the past 10 years: 45 verified deaths. But it is not 
widely known that there were five more documented deaths in Croatia than in Bosnia, 
and that most of the victims were local journalists who appear to have been personally 
targeted because of their work. As in Rwanda, local journalists in the former Yugoslavia 
were singled out in the early stages of genocidal attacks because of their presumed prominence and influence. And of the 22 foreign reporters who are known to have died 
covering the war in Bosnia, a significant but ultimately unverifiable number were 
deliberately killed by armed belligerents who perceived the international press as 
their enemy. This, again, is increasingly the pattern in civil wars from Algeria to Somalia 
to Afghanistan.<BR>
<BR>
Colombia claimed the third-largest number of confirmed deaths over the past decade: 
43, most (though not all) apparent drug-cartel contract murders. This number is certainly 
an underestimate: Many reported murders of provincial print and radio reporters in Colombia could not be confirmed, a problem tragically typical of a country with 
the highest reported homicide rate in the world. Most of these murders remain not 
only unsolved but uninvestigated. So inured is the Colombian press to these killings--and 
so intimidated are many local publishers--that these cases rarely make the papers, let 
alone the front page.<BR>
<BR>
The Colombian problem has spread to its neighbors: Journalists in Central America, 
Peru, Venezuela and elsewhere in the region now say their biggest fear is violent 
reprisals for reporting on drug trafficking. And suspected drug traffickers are also 
targeting journalists in Russia, Central Europe, Central Asia and Indochina. In the coming 
decade, threats to journalism from organized crime could well become an even more 
deadly problem than political persecution. <BR>
<BR>
In Asia, where autocrats of both the left and right condemn press freedom as inimical 
to indigenous Asian "cultural values," the dangers faced by journalists are typically 
imprisonment or legal harassment. Murders of journalists, in proportion to the size of the working press, are surprisingly rare. <BR>
<BR>
Yet the final two countries on this unhappy list are both Asian. In both the Philippines 
and Tajikistan, CPJ has confirmed 29 violent job-related deaths of journalists over 
the past decade, almost all of them apparently deliberate, politically motivated 
murders. <BR>
<BR>
In many other ways--politically, culturally--these countries are also atypical of Asia. 
The Philippines, with its legacy of Spanish colonialism and U.S. military rule, has 
a history and social structure arguably more akin to Latin America's, and the pattern of unprosecuted murders of provincial Filipino journalists who uncovered corruption 
and human rights abuses among local landowners and security chiefs is disturbingly 
similar to death-squad killings of reporters in Central and South America. (Another 
common denominator is a continuing counterinsurgency campaign against Marxist rebels, 
which has also claimed casualties in the press corps.) Though more common in the 
Marcos era, these homicides continued under the Aquino and Ramos governments--in part, 
it seems, because the restoration of democracy emboldened local publications to cover subjects 
they would have avoided in the past. <BR>
<BR>
The case of Tajikistan is more distinctive still. Though this neighbor of China is 
geographically Asian, it has never been part of the continent politically. Nominally 
independent since 1991, Tajikistan remains within Moscow's shrinking sphere of influence. A CPJ investigation demonstrated compelling circumstantial evidence of the government's 
complicity in most of the 29 verifiable murders of Tajik journalists over the past 
four years, and it is a government wholly dependent on Russian economic and military support. Yet Moscow is rarely taken to task for sustaining a regime that has ruthlessly 
eliminated all traces of an independent press. More disturbing, this lack of press 
freedom is fast becoming the norm throughout Central Asia. None of the five now-independent Central Asian republics permits truly independent local news reporting, 
and yet all receive support from foreign governments and aid donors who are ostensibly 
committed to freedom of expression and other democratic values. <BR>
<BR>
When journalists are murdered simply for doing their job, it often seems to all of us on CPJ's board 
and staff that we have manifestly failed at our central assignment--protecting journalists. 
But by reporting the stories of these slain journalists to their colleagues around the world, we can at least ensure that they will not be forgotten. And by pressing 
governments to treat the job-related murders of journalists as political assassinations, 
we hope to make top officials personally committed to prosecuting these crimes. We also seek to make them aware that failure to do so calls into question their avowed 
commitment to press freedom. By raising the stakes, of course, we also hope to deter 
future assailants. Ultimately, journalists cannot be completely protected. Journalism is a dangerous profession, entered voluntarily. In many if not most countries 
the "without fear or favor" formula remains a distant dream. But the fight of journalists 
around the world to do their jobs in the most difficult circumstances deserves active and engaged support, and this report attests to their remarkable tenacity, courage 
and professional dedication.<BR>
