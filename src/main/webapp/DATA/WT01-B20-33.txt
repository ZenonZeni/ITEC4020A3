<p align="center"><b>Latest National Household Survey Results
Sound Marijuana Alarm (Again)</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 12, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp;
Speaking at a formal press conference, both Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Drug Czar Lee Brown took
time out to once again urge Americans to denounce the use of
marijuana.&nbsp; &quot;Marijuana use is illegal, dangerous,
unhealthy, and wrong,&quot; Shalala reaffirmed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Armed with preliminary estimates from the 1994 National Survey on
Drug Abuse, the duo remarked that while overall illicit drug use
(defined as once in the past month) among the population as a
whole rose only marginally in the past year, the number of
teenagers using marijuana has nearly doubled since 1992.&nbsp;
&quot;Anyone who thinks we've licked the drug problem in this
country is living in a fantasy land,&quot; the Secretary remarked
at the press conference. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the study's preliminary findings, teens using
marijuana at least once a month rose from 4% in 1992 to 7.3% in
1994.&nbsp; Shalala called the findings &quot;a wake-up call for
America.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Put in historical context, however, the latest adolescent use
statistics still remain far below the peak reached in 1980.&nbsp;
According to annual studies conducted by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, the number of high school seniors ever having
admitted to experimenting with marijuana dropped significantly
from 50.9 percent in 1980 to 38.2 percent in 1994.&nbsp; Although
neither Brown nor Shalala mentioned this data during the
conference, the Office of National Drug Control Policy did
specify that even with the recent increase in the number of
teenagers admitting to having used marijuana regularly, current
adolescent rates of marijuana use still rank well below what they
were fifteen years ago. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Brown speculated that the latest increase in teen marijuana
consumption might be due to pot's glamorization by the
entertainment industry. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Update: Todd McCormick Free On Bail!</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 7, 1995, Bryan, OH:</b>&nbsp; At a
September 7 bail reduction hearing, medical marijuana user and
San Diego Compassionate Use Club founder Todd McCormick had his
bail dropped from $50,000 to $2,000.&nbsp; He posted bail at
approximately 4:55 p.m. the following day and is currently
staying with Don Wirtshafter at the Ohio Hempery in Guysville. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">McCormick was arrested on July 18 when Ohio State Patrolmen
discovered in excess of thirty pounds of marijuana in his
van.&nbsp; McCormick maintains that the cannabis, all of which
was visibly marked &quot;for medicinal use only,&quot; was
intended to be used to establish a Compassionate Use Club in
Rhode Island and was not meant for sale.&nbsp; He is charged with
four felony drug counts. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Meanwhile, Landmark State Decision Could
Spell Victory<br>
For McCormick's Upcoming Trial</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 10, 1995, Columbus, OH:</b>&nbsp;
Civil liberty and personal privacy proponents achieved a major
victory last week when the Ohio Supreme Court ruled to severely
limit the rights of police to question citizens or search their
property after misdemeanor roadside traffic stops.&nbsp; Northcoast
NORML President John Hartman applauded the court's ruling.&nbsp;
&quot;People in the cannabis community will be driving a little
easier [now] in the state of Ohio,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a 4-3 decision, the court struck down the drug arrest of a man
whose car was searched following a routine traffic stop.&nbsp;
The court maintained that the evidence seized during the search was
invalid because the search itself was in violation of the Fourth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; According to the AP,
&quot;The court said that although the driver gave his consent,
the search was improper because the deputy never told the driver
[that] he was free to go after the traffic stop and before the
drug search began.&quot;&nbsp; The law states that police cannot
automatically search a car based upon a traffic misdemeanor. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Defense attorney Harry R. Reinhart praised the ruling.&nbsp; He
explained that hundreds of innocent Ohio motorists are stopped
each year by police and intimidated into having their automobiles searched
because law enforcement officials purposely neglect to inform
citizens of their legal right to say no. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One can only wait and see what potential ramifications this
decision may have on Todd McCormick's upcoming trial.&nbsp;
McCormick had his van searched after Ohio State Patrolmen pulled him
over &quot;because the curtains in [his] van were
closed.&quot;&nbsp; McCormick maintains that he did not give
police permission to search his vehicle. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Distinguished Chicago Judge Advocates
Marijuana Legalization</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 14, 1995, Chicago, IL:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Posner, Chicago's chief federal appeals judge and one of
America's most prominent legal scholars, recommends that
marijuana use should be legalized as a way of reducing crime and
unclogging the courts.&nbsp; Posner, a Reagan administration appointee
once heralded by American Lawyer magazine as &quot;the most
brilliant judge in the country,&quot; is the highest ranking
judge to ever publicly advocate the repeal of marijuana
laws.&nbsp; His endorsement of marijuana reform was the focus of
a feature article in both <i>USA Today</i> and <i>The Times
Literary Supplement</i>, a British publication. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the <i>USA Today</i> article, Posner stated that: &quot;It is
nonsense that we should be devoting so many law enforcement
resources to marijuana.&nbsp; I am skeptical that a society that
is so tolerant of alcohol and cigarettes should come down so hard
on marijuana use and send people to prison for life without
parole.&quot;&nbsp; <b>NORML</b>'s Senior Policy Advisor, Richard
Cowan, was also quoted in the story. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>USA Today</i> also ran an editorial endorsing the use of
marijuana as a medicine last month.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Secret Service Threatens Couple For Stamping
One Dollar Bills</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 11, 1995, Woodstock, New York:</b>&nbsp;
A couple who habitually brand their one dollar bills with a
marijuana leaf and the quote: &quot;I grew hemp,&quot; were
recently contacted by Woodstock police acting on behalf of the
Secret Service.&nbsp; Joy Beckerman and James Horn, owners of the
Heaven On Earth Hemp Store, report that the police came to them
with Xerox copies of stamped dollar bills and a written warning
from the secret service specifying that the practice of defacing
United States currency was a federal crime.&nbsp; Although Horn
admits that the local officers were laid back about the whole
issue, he claims that the notice stated that the U.S. Attorney
General would be contacted and charges would be pressed if the
couple didn't immediately stop the stamping. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">While Horn fully admits to stamping many of his dollar bills with
the pro-hemp message, he is alarmed that the federal government
seems to be targeting him alone.&nbsp; Since Heaven On Earth
sells the &quot;I grew hemp&quot; stampers, the couple argues
that the government has no way of proving that the bills in
question were defaced by them. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Horn says that he will continue to both sell stampers and stamp
some of his one dollar bills despite the warning.&nbsp; The
couple see their action as a way of informing the community of
hemp's industrial uses and its historical background as an
integral American crop. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact either Joy Beckerman or
James Horn of Heaven On Earth @ (914) 679-4990.</i></p>
