<FONT SIZE=3> U.S. national interests are safeguarded through BXA's effective administration of export control laws relating to <A href="#index9"><B><I>dual-use</I></B></A> technologies.  Controls are maintained on exports from the United States, and reexports of U.S.-origin items from foreign destinations, on strategic commodities and technical data worldwide to prevent the diversion of such strategic items to end-users or end-uses of concern.<p>

The effectiveness of these controls is enhanced by their being maintained as part of multilateral control arrangements.    The Wassenaar Arrangement (e.g. conventional arms and related dual use items),  the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Australia Group (e.g. chemical precursors and biological agents), and the Missile Technology Control Regime are the four multilateral export control regimes in which the United States participates. BXA implements U.S. foreign policy controls such as crime control, antiterrorism and regional stability and is responsible for export controls on terrorist countries.  BXA also administers export controls to protect the United States from the adverse impact of the unrestricted export of commodities in short supply (e.g. some crude oil, other petroleum products, and unprocessed western red cedar). <p>

</font><font size=2>The convenient term "dual use" is sometimes used to distinguish the types of items covered by the EAR from those that are covered by the regulations of certain other export licensing agencies.  In general, the term dual use serves to distinguish EAR-controlled items that can be used both in sensitive (e.g., military or nuclear) and other, non- sensitive applications from those that are (a) weapons or military-related in use or design and subject to the controls of the Department of State or (b) subject to the nuclear-related controls of the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Note, however, that although the short-hand term dual use may be employed to refer to the entire scope of the EAR, the EAR also apply to some items that have solely civil uses.
