<P>November 22, 1996</P>
<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  &#167;   Stellar 6.6% third-quarter GDP growth, though
likely to continue through mid-1997, hasn't  completely erased inherent
Argentine pessimism about the economy.  &#167;  Supported by small parties
unhappy with corruption but wanting economic continuity, Cavallo will try to nab
a seat in the lower house of congress in next year's mid-term elections.  Page 2</P>
<P><B>BOLIVIA</B>  &#167;   Foreign investors are pouring money into their new
telecommunications, power and transport  holdings even faster than the
innovative capitalization plan foresaw, and several hundred million more dollars
may soon be on the way from new investors in oil and mining.  &#167;  The
long-anticipated pension reform legislation is awaiting lower house confirmation
after passage in the senate.  Page 3</P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   Second-round municipal elections highlighted the
spectacular rise of right-wing presidential aspirant  Paulo Maluf and further
complicated President Cardoso's hopes of convincing legislators to allow his
re-election.  &#167;  Politicians and military leaders are erecting roadblocks
against privatization of mining giant CVRD. &#167;  The government has sped up
auto part tariff hikes.  Page 4</P>
<P><B>CHILE</B>  &#167;   A change in the base exchange rate is being mulled
as a means to weaken the indexation system that  has hampered efforts to bring
inflation down to industrialized-nation levels.  &#167;  Copper fever is giving
way to a gold rush led by Canadian developers.  Page 5</P>
<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   Buoyed by strong oil prices and economic recovery
next door in Venezuela, growth should  bounce back above 4% in 1997.  &#167;  A
study warns that private investment in oil is in danger of falling dramatically
after the year 2000 unless the government revisits the investment regime for the
sector.   Page 6</P>
<P><B>CUBA</B>  &#167;   Scoffing at Helms-Burton restrictions, investors are
planning forays into real estate, construction and  finance to take advantage of
pending government initiatives favoring those sectors.  &#167;  Latin American
leaders denounced US efforts to keep investment out of Cuba.  &#167;  A growth
spurt earlier this year will help offset the cost of hurricane Lily and higher
oil import prices.   Page 7</P>
<P><B>MEXICO  </B> &#167;   Using a recent Pemex plant fire as an excuse,
opponents of the oil company chief are calling for his  head.  But their real
complaints are against his cost-cutting and support of privatization.  &#167; 
In a blow to President Zedillo's hopes for consensus on political reform,
opposition parties refused to support a new electoral law, but the ruling PRI
approved a weaker version anyway.  Page 8</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA</B>  &#167;   Strong demand for shares of phone company CANTV
is seen as a good omen for the success  of the privatization of the aluminum and
steel sectors, but skeptics also point out that these sell-offs are fraught with
obstacles that were not present in the CANTV sale.  &#167;  A presidential
decree has put electricity back on the privatization agenda.  &#167;  PDVSA is
planning a Chinese joint venture for boiler fuel Orimulsion; meanwhile, the oil
union warns it won't stand for foreign companies ignoring worker rights.  Page 9</P>
<P><B>SPECIAL REPORT/MEXICAN PENSION REFORM</B>  &#167;   A six-month delay in
the start-up of the new  private pension system has angered the many funds
chafing to start their new business, but their desires are no match for the $2
billion savings the budget-conscious government will reap from the slower
schedule.  Page 10</P>

<H1>Pemex Fire Gives Fuel To Statist Opponents Of Modernization</H1>
<P>A fire at a northern Mexico City gasoline distribution terminal, the site of
a major accident 12 years ago, has revived controversy over the national oil
company, Pemex. It has turned into a rallying cry against the company's chief by
opponents of his modernizing ambitions and support for petrochemical
privatizations. </P>
<P>As industrial accidents go, this was fairly mild. On November 11, a safety
valve at the San Juan Ixhuatepec (popularly known as San Juanico) terminal began
to leak. Before a safety team could finish repairs, the gasoline caught fire. It
took almost two days to extinguish the flames, which destroyed a main gasoline
tank and a smaller one, and damaged a third tank. Pemex estimated damage at P40
million or $5 million, almost nothing for a company that does more than $20
billion a year in business. Three Pemex workers and a firefighter died. A 1984
explosion in the same place, by contrast, left more than 500 people died.</P>
<P><B>Media Saturation. </B>The political consequences, how ever, were
important. Public reaction became a firestorm over safety procedures and the
privatization of petro chemical plants, a controversial plan that ruling-party
dinosaurs recently sabotaged (LL 11/8/96). Public indig nation was especially
severe because the fire took place in the media center of the country, and in an
area of the capital symbolically important because of the 1984 disaster. A
television network broadcast the fire live for hours, capturing 40% of the
national audience. </P>
<P>To make matters worse, Pemex director general Adrian Lajous was out of the
country, accompanying President Ernesto Zedillo on a trip around South America,
when the accident took place. Thus, during the first hours after the accident,
only lower-level officials appeared in public to face criticism. </P>
<P><B>Sacrificial Lamb. </B>Calls for the resignation of Lajous, a career
Pemex administrator, started almost immediately. Opposition politicians argued
that Pemex had suffered several major industrial accidents since Lajous took
over as director general in 1995. The most serious was a July 1996 explosion
that destroyed the Cactus gas processing facility in Chiapas and left six dead.</P>
<P>The real issue appears to be not the San Juanico accident itself, but
instead Lajous' staunch public stand favoring privatization of the country's
petrochemical plants. Making matters worse politically, he has cut spending and
staff and tried to improve efficiency. As a result, he is at odds with powerful
leftist groups in both the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) and
opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). </P>
<P>These groups argue that spending cuts are to blame for the accident. Pemex
management points out that maintenance spending has actually increased over the
past few years, and that both maintenance spending and dedicated staff remain
well within international standards. They released documents indicating that
Pemex registers a smaller number of accidents than similarly-sized oil firms. A
top company official with the company has, however, conceded that these
accidents do tend to be more serious, partly because workers do not follow
safety procedures. </P>
<P><B>Consultants Called In. </B>Pemex has asked international consultants to
study the San Juanico fire and previous accidents. In two meetings with
legislators November 19, Lajous said preliminary information suggests a faulty
valve caused the fire. He added that Pemex will create a special safety
commission to establish procedures to reduce future accidents.</P>
<P>But criticism has not abated. A top PRI official told Lagniappe that Lajous
had to resign, if only to ease political pressure on the president. Lajous
retorts that he would quit if he thought it would improve safety at Pemex.
President Zedillo so far, has allowed Lajous to stay in the job. Maybe this is
because he believes in the overall vision Lajous has to offer, or because Pemex
profits are the highest in history. </P>
<H2>Opposition Snubs PRI Electoral Reform</H2>
<P>Hoped-for multi-party consensus on a new electoral law failed to
materialize, so President Zedillo had to settle for the watered-down reform
congress passed November 19. The ruling PRI was the only party to vote for the
project, making it harder for Zedillo to tout the reform as an achievement and
opening next year's mid-term elections to opposition criticism of the new
electoral law.</P>
<P>Though it falls short of earlier expectations, the legislation still
contains some worthwhile reforms. Most significantly, electoral authorities are
no longer designated by the government since electoral tribunals are now a part
of the judicial branch instead of the executive. There are new rules for access
to the media and a clearer campaign financing system imposing spending caps and
prohibiting private funds.</P>
<P><B>Financing Controversy.</B> Campaign finance rules were the main obstacle
to consensus. The PRI asked for P2.2 billion (about $278 million) to be spent by
all parties in the 1997 campaigns. The opposition demanded that the figure be
lowered to between P900 million and P1 billion ($114-$126 million). The PRI
version, which prevailed, distributes funds according to a formula allotting 30%
of funds equally between parties, and another 70% based on previous electoral
results, meaning the PRI still gets the lion's share. In addition, penalties for
violating spending caps have been softened.</P>
