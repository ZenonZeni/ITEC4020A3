<HR></center>
<p>Since age 14, when Dr. Tamis' father taught him ovarian transplantation, the younger Tamis has
 been involved with research.  That research background has been a dominant characteristic of his
 approach to medicine, and that philosophy permeates all aspects of this institution.</p>
<p>One can summarize our approach to medicine, especially infertility, with two statements:<p>
<ul><b>Build a better "mouse trap."</b>
<ul>Whether one discusses our innovative C.A.R.E. financial package, our
individualized approach to stimulation protocols, or our various routes of
hormone administration.  We constantly look for ways to improve what we do, thus
staying at the cutting edge of our field.</ul></ul>
<p>
<ul><b>Infertility is "a mystery."</b>
<ul>Thus our approach to treating the patient is one of being the "detective" hired to
look for the clues to your individual problem.  Without searching for those clues,
one will have difficulty correcting infertility.  Some patient present themselves to
us with very obvious problems, but for most, the cause of their infertility is
complicated. requiring innovative management.</ul></ul></p>
<p>
<ul><b>Not all infertility treatment requires high tech procedures</b>
<ul>Long before invitro fertilization was developed for humans (did you know it was
performed successfully in the rabbit in 1930?), Dr. T@s has had a deep
involvement in evaluating and treating infertility problems.  Today, we still believe
that most problems of fertility can be treated by simply looking for the "clues" that
each patient or couple presents.  Thus, careful evaluation of hormone levels, timing
of ovulation in relationship to LH surge, onset of menses post LH surge, etc many
times can be the signal for simple hormonal manipulation without the need for high
tech procedures.  The easiest way to achieve a pregnancy - is the best way!</ul></ul></p>
<p>
<ul><b>Integrin</b>
<ul>At the end of 1994, we began participating with Dr. Lessey at the University of
North Carolina evaluating failure of invitro fertilization with regards to the
presence or absence of integrin within the endometrium.  The data obtained from
our involvement with Dr. Lessey's group has helped us a high success rate with
frozen embryo transfers in natural cycles in 1995.
Along with the above, Dr. Tamis has been actively involved in the fight for women's reproductive
health.  Thus, the Institute's staff cares for all women - single, married, or otherwise - concerned about their reproductive status.</ul></ul></p>
