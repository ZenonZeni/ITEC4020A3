<PRE>Day 1...
  The  bottom  layer  is shredded manure, the next layer  is  of  plant
waste shredded.
     The next layer is of rock dust, the next layer is of bloodmeal and
bonemeal mixed, optional, kitchen food wastes ok here instead. The next
layer is of old shredded manure such as horse. The next layer is of top
soil, the next layer is of kelp meal or seaweed meal, the next layer is
of  rock dust. Then add  either rabbit,or goat (shredded) or earthworm
castings.  Then  add either grass clippings, leaves or both  mixed  and
shredded,  then add a layer either of old horse or old sheep or old cow
manure, then add a layer of dia-earth (for fly control); Top it off with
a  4  in  layer of top soil. In between each layer you should  add  the
following:  mix  together  equal parts:  Cottonseedmeal,  Alfalfa  meal
Kelpmeal,  Epsom  Salts,  Rock  dust or Greensand  or  Rock  Phosphate,
Compost.
     The  idea  is to lightly sprinkle a thin layer of this formula  in
between  each  layer, while also spraying (lightly)  a  liquid  seaweed
mixture  such  as a Superseaweed™ and Nitron™ and Shure Crop  mixture
(1 cup  each  added  to  1  gallon water, 20 drops  of  superseaweed).  Use
filtered water. Your compost bin should have a lid and be made of  wood
to allow it to breathe.
<STRONG><H4>Day 2:</H4></STRONG>
     Allow to sit
<STRONG><H3>Day 3:</H3></STRONG>
     Check the temp. Write this down in your log book
<STRONG><H4>Day 4:</H4></STRONG>
     Turn contents of bin #1 into bin #2 (you should have three bins for
this purpose), turning over well and adding a sprinkling of the formula
as  you go and also spraying with the liquid seaweed. Start the process
over again in bin #1.
<STRONG><H4>Day 5:</H4></STRONG>
     Check the temp in both bins , note this in your compost log.  Turn
over bin #2, making sure everything is turned over well while adding  a
thin sprinkling of the formula. Check to make sure neither bin is too
wet  or too dry. Add water as needed by spraying (this water is the same
liquid seaweed I've been talking about).
<STRONG><H4>Day 6:</H4></STRONG>
     Allow both bins to sit.
<STRONG><H4>Day 7:</H4></STRONG> This is your first week! Isn't compost making fun!!!
       Today  you  turn over both compost bins, checking  for  moisture
  and heat.
<STRONG><H4>Day 8:</H4></STRONG>
     Then  the  next day dump the contents of bin #2 into bin #3,  turn
bin #1 into bin #2 and start all over again with bin #1.
<STRONG><H4>Day 9:</H4></STRONG>
       Allow everyone to sit and rest.
<STRONG><H4>Day 10:</H4></STRONG>
     Turn  over bin #3 (sprinkle with formula mixture).  Turn  over  bin
#2 (sprinkle with formula mixture).   Check all bins for water, temp.
<STRONG><H4>Day 11:</H4></STRONG>
     Allow everyone to rest today, checking for too much water etc.
<STRONG><H4>Day 12</H4></STRONG>
     Check  on  bin #3, how does the compost look? Are there any  parts
which don't look decomposed? Remove that and place in bin #1. Turn over
bin #3 ,water as needed with liquid seaweed and add a sprinkling of the
formula.  Check bin#2 , how are we doing here? Turn over  and  sprinkle
formula and add water (liquid seaweed) as needed.
<STRONG><H4>Day 13:</H4></STRONG>
     Two more days to go... Allow all bins to sit and rest today
<STRONG><H4>Day 14:</H4></STRONG>
     Well here it is, the day you've been working for. Check bin #3  and
tadum!!! Rich compost. Never add raw waste into bins #2, #3. These bins
are  for finishing the composting process. Bin #1 is where you may also
add  kitchen waste such as rice leftovers, salad leftovers, etc.  Never
add  meat or cooking oils as this will stop the composting process  and
you  may  even have to dispose of the compost. You may add egg  shells,
coffee grinds, to the first bin only. Rock Dust is excellent for helping
the composting process.
