The vision is staggering: a society powered almost entirely by hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe. In
this vision, renewable resources such as wind and solar energy are used to extract hydrogen from water. When the
hydrogen is used as an energy source, it generates no emissions other than water, which is recycled to make more
hydrogen. Making this vision a reality in the 21st century is the goal of researchers at the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory.

<FONT SIZE=6>Hydrogen and Its Uses</FONT><BR>
Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless gas that accounts for 75 percent of the universe's mass. Hydrogen is found on Earth
only in combination with other elements such as oxygen, carbon and nitrogen. To use hydrogen, it must be separated
from these other elements.

<DD>Today, hydrogen is used primarily in ammonia manufacturing, petroleum refining and synthesis of methanol. It's also
used in NASA's space program as fuel for the space shuttles, and in fuel cells that provide heat, electricity and
drinking water for astronauts. Fuel cells are devices that directly convert hydrogen into electricity. In the future,
hydrogen could be used to fuel vehicles and aircraft, and provide power for our homes and offices.

As part of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Hydrogen Program, NREL conducts research on advanced
technologies to produce, store and safely use hydrogen made from renewable resources. The goal is to help industry
develop technologies to produce, store, transport and use hydrogen in quantities large enough, and at costs cheap
enough, to compete with traditional energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas.

<DD>NREL researchers are exploring using renewable resources such as sunlight, biomass and biological organisms to
produce hydrogen economically.

<DD>Photoconversion production-Researchers use either biological organisms (bacteria or algae) or semiconductors to
absorb sunlight, split water and produce hydrogen. Through their normal metabolic function, some biological
organisms naturally produce hydrogen; semiconductors produce hydrogen by generating an electric current that splits
water.

<DD>Thermochemical production-This approach uses heat to produce hydrogen from biomass and solid waste. An
NREL-developed pyrolysis technology uses heat to liquefy biomass. Steam is then used to make hydrogen from the
resulting bio-oil in a process known as steam reforming.

<FONT SIZE=6>Storage Research</FONT><BR>
Hydrogen is currently stored as a compressed gas or a cryogenic liquid in physical storage systems. NREL is
developing a solid-state storage system that is safer than physical storage systems, and could potentially store more
hydrogen per unit volume. Solid-state systems chemically or physically bind hydrogen to a solid material.

<DD>NREL's solid-state storage system uses microscopic carbon tubes to adsorb hydrogen. The technology can store high
volumes of hydrogen at higher temperatures than other technologies, and at near ambient pressure levels. The
hydrogen attaches to the surface of the carbon and is released by changing temperature and pressure levels.

<FONT SIZE=6>Hydrogen Sensors</FONT><BR>
Since hydrogen can neither be seen nor smelled, as an added safety precaution for hydrogen-fueled vehicles, NREL
researchers are developing a hydrogen leak detector. To detect hydrogen, a very thin sensor that reacts to hydrogen by
changing colors is applied to the end of a fiber optic cable. The sensors can be placed throughout the vehicle to relay
information on leak detection to a central control panel.

<FONT SIZE=6>Industry Interaction</FONT><BR>
Through working groups, NREL scientists interact with researchers from other national laboratories and industry to
exchange technical information and receive industry input on the direction of NREL's research program. These
working groups help NREL understand industry's needs, and help industry understand the technologies NREL is
developing.

<FONT SIZE=6>Benefits of Hydrogen</FONT><BR>
Hydrogen made from renewable energy resources is a virtually inexhaustible, environmentally benign energy source
that could meet most of our future energy needs. It's more versatile and has more uses than electricity. These uses
include providing energy for businesses, factories, electric utilities, homes, vehicles and airplanes. Hydrogen is also a
domestically produced energy source that could help reduce our reliance on foreign oil.

<FONT SIZE=6>Challenges</FONT><BR>
Researchers must overcome several obstacles if hydrogen is to become a major energy resource. Hydrogen is
currently more expensive than traditional energy sources; the production efficiency (the amount of energy or
feedstock used to produce hydrogen) must improve; and an infrastructure to efficiently transport and distribute
hydrogen must be developed. NREL's research is directed towards resolving these issues.



<DD>The first widespread use of hydrogen as an energy source is likely to be in the transportation sector, where it will help
reduce pollution. Internal combustion engines can be fueled with pure hydrogen, or hydrogen blended with natural
gas. Vehicles can also be powered with hydrogen fuel cells, which are three times more efficient than a
gasoline-powered engine. Fuel cells can also supply heat and electricity for homes and buildings.

<DD>The overall goal of DOE's Hydrogen Program is to replace 2 to 4 quads of conventional energy with hydrogen by the
year 2010, and replace 10 quads per year by 2030. A quad is the amount of energy consumed by 1 million
households.

WASHINGTON, DC - Unlike many other programs under scrutiny by the new Republican-run Congress, hydrogen
ener- gy research funding for once is actually ahead of the game - and ahead of what even some hydrogen supporters
had hoped for: The House-Senate conference, whose task it is to reconcile differing House and Senate versions of the
same bill, decided in late October to allocate $14.5 million for fiscal year 1996 to DoE's hydrogen energy program.
continued... 
<DD>     This was almost twice the budget estimate of $7.33 million, according to a budget chart published in the
     Oct. 26 issue of the "Congressional Record," and much closer to the $15 million voted earlier by the House
     and a far cry from the $9 million voted by the Senate. One veteran Capitol Hill watcher predicted then, the
     total probably wouldn't exceed $12 million (H&FCL, Sept. 95). (The chart did not list the current '95
     budget for the various categories).

<FONT SIZE=6>Newcomer Rep. Frank Riggs (R-CA) Plays Role </FONT><BR><BR>

     According to several sources, a pivotal member of the Conference was Rep. Frank Riggs (R-CA), a
     newcomer to this session but who had previously served two terms in Congress. Riggs, a member of the
     House Appropriations energy and water subcommittee from Northern California, had visited the Schatz
     Energy Research Center at Humboldt State University in Arcata earlier and had come away impressed with
     the work there on hydrogen and fuel cells. It was apparently Riggs who convinced the other conferees of the
     worth of adding a few million dollars to the hydrogen appropriation.

   <DD>  This surprise development - aided no doubt by the very smallness of the program in a place where anything
     below a million dollar tends to drop below the horizon - was in contrast to big-ticket programs such as
     "solar and renewable energy" which slid from the $326.4 million request to $187.2 million. Strongest hit
     was solar building technology research which came in at less than half of the budget request, from $4.7
     million to $2 million. Photovoltaics dropped from 88.1 to 65 million.

<FONT SIZE=6>Fuel Cells Do Well, But House Rejects Entire Interior Bill </FONT><BR>

     In general, fuel cells programs are not controversial, and they have avoided the sharp cutbacks that have
     been inflicted elsewhere. Earlier last month, the House-Senate Conference for the Interior appropriation
     voted $22 million as a compromise for the House vote of $19.4 million and the Senate's $23 million for
     transportation fuel cells, plus $38 million for fuel cell power generation programs. The compromise took
     out harsh House language which would have eliminated a direct-hydrogen fuel cell program, affecting Ford
     and Chrysler. Conferees agreed to the Senate version which did not contain those provisions. The overriding
     problem now is that the House subsequently rejected the entire Interior appropriation over mineral rights
     fees, and no resolution is in sight.

<DD>     The Defense appropriation includes $12 million for the second year of the "buy down" cost sharing program
     for fuel cell procurement, plus another $7 million for molten carbonate research. Again, the fuel cell
     portions were resolved in confer- ence but the House rejected the entire Defense bill over a dispute on
     federal financing of abortions for military personnel and dependents.

    <DD> The Transportation appropriation which has been approved in Conference, includes $5 million for fuel cell
     bus develop- ment. The entire bill has been approved in the House and is pending in the Senate, but
     transportation spending in general is on hold temporarily because of a dispute over a separate federal
     highway bill.

 <DD>    Fuel cell technology is not controversial in Congress, and some observers believe that with the basic
     numbers and issues resolved, the fuel cell language will eventually make it into law. Still resolved must be
     the even bigger threat looming over the '96 budget and the very operation of the government - Presi- dent
     Clinton's threatened veto. Both Congress and President Clinton seem eager to avoid legislative gridlock,
     however. If no budget agreement can be reached, the government's agencies may operate once again under a
     "continuing resolu- tion" in fiscal year '96, in which case the hydrogen program would be cut back to the
     current year's level of $10 million. Transportation fuel cells would be reduced to $18 million.
