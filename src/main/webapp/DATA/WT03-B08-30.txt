CRACKING IN LARGE-SIZED LONG-SPAN PRESTRESSED CONCRETE
GIRDERS

During the production of large-sized long-span
prestressed concrete AASHTO girders in the prestressing
plant, vertical cracks often develop near the mid-third
of the span after the girders have been cured overnight
on the casting bed and before the prestressing strands
are detensioned.  The cracks extend across the top
flange of the girder transversely and penetrate
vertically down through the girder web, reaching toward
the bottom flange.

This (North Carolina State University) report presents
and discusses an investigation to identify the causes
of the problem and recommendations for its remedies.
It includes: a national survey of prestressed concrete
producers to assess the status of the problem; a
literature review of relevant issues; a series of
laboratory and field studies to determine the condition
of concrete and tendon forceS during the curing period;
and an analysis of the girder under-restrained thermal
contraction.

ANALYSIS OF A SYSTEM FOR DYNAMICALLY MEASURING ROAD
DEFLECTION

This (University of Michigan) report concerns analysis
of a system for dynamically measuring road deflection.
The system configuration consists of an instrumented
tractor-trailer truck to make road deflection
measurements at highway speeds.  The proposed system
utilizes a beam that carries laser distance-measuring
sensors.  The sensors are positioned to make reference
measurements of undeflected surface as well as the
deflected surface.  Signal processing algorithms are
proposed that give the system the potential to
compensate for beam movement as well as random surface-
texture features.  The report presents a complete error
analysis of the system, including suitable mathematical
models for all components as well as all signal
processing steps.  A random and systematic error
analysis is conducted of all components and the
complete system, showing that the system's total errors
are within allowable error-bands for practical
applications.

COMPACT HEAT EXCHANGERS: INVESTIGATION OF LOCAL HEAT
TRANSFER BY HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY

Compact heat exchangers are key components for the
development of future aircraft devices.  This
translation from Germany (Technische University)
presents a technique for enhancement of the heat
transfer rate, resulting in a decrease of the heat
exchanger size and, thus, lower weight and lower
investment costs.  An exact knowledge of the
temperature distribution in the boundary layer is
necessary for a specific augmentation of heat transfer.
The holographic interferometry is applied as a
measuring method to enable visualization of the
temperature field without disturbing the flow pattern.
The local Nusselt number is determined from the
isotherms at the wall.  A digital image-processing
system is used for evaluation of interferograms.  The
measuring method is demonstrated for three different
types of geometries for compact heat exchangers, using:
air as the test fluid; plain fin arrangements of
plate-fin heat exchangers; flow in a profile-shaped
duct for tubular matrices; and flow over circular
segment-shaped turbulence promoters.  During the
experiments, the Reynolds number is varied between 500
and 3000, a range where low pressure losses occur.

ANALYSIS OF VIBRATION-INDUCED THREAD MOVEMENT IN BOLTED
CONNECTIONS

This (Auburn University) report discusses the main
design parameters contributing to the loosening of
bolts due to vibration, and identifies the relative
importance and degree of contribution of each parameter
to bolt loosening.  Vibration testing is conducted on a
shaketable having controlled random input.  Test
specimens are vibrated for a fixed amount of time and
the percentage of pre-load loss is measured.  Each
specimen tested implements some combination of
11  design parameters, as dictated by the design of the
experimental methodology employed.  The 11 design
parameters are: bolt size (diameter); lubrication on
the bolt; hole tolerance; initial pre-load; nut locking
device; grip length; thread-pitch; lubrication between
mating materials; class of fit; joint configuration;
and the mass of the configuration.  Two values of each
design parameter are used, and each combination of
parameters tested is subjected to two different
directions and two different g-levels of vibration.
One replication is made for each test to gain some
indication of experimental error and repeatability, and
to give some degree of statistical credibility to the
data -- which results in a total of 96 tests being
performed.

PIEZOELECTRIC AND PYROELECTRIC SENSORS

The pyroelectric properties of the composite
%Ca/Epikote 828, at 50/50 and 60/40 vol %,
respectively, are given in this report from North Wales
(the University College of North Wales).  The report
provides an account of the preparation of pure lead
titanate and calcium modified lead titanate (%Ca) by
the sol-gel process.  X-ray spectroscopic structural
analysis and differential scanning calorimetric studies
of the ceramic grains produced by this technique are
given.  The sol-gel method for preparation of
ferroelectric ceramics can offer many advantages over
conventional processing techniques.  The ceramics
produced via the sol-gel method: show high degrees of
purity and homogeneity; can produce fine powders; are
able to be formed into a variety of structures; and can
be processed at lower temperatures.

COPPER PRECIPITATES AND POINT-DEFECT CLUSTERS IN
REACTOR PRESSURE VESSEL EMBRITTLEMENT

Embrittlement of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels
is believed to arise primarily from matrix hardening
due to the formation of radiation-induced point-defect
clusters (PDC) and radiation-enhanced copper-rich
precipitates (CRP).  This (Oak Ridge National
Laboratory) report discusses a model developed to
investigate the relative importance of PDC and CRP in
RPV embrittlement.  The model is used to determine the
influence of a range of irradiation and material
parameters on the predicted change in yield strength.

RESEARCH ON PRESSURE VESSEL STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report concerns
technology used to assess the safety of
irradiation-embrittled nuclear reactor pressure vessels
(RPVs) containing flaws.  Fracture mechanics tests on
RPV steel, coupled with detailed elastic-plastic
finite-element analyses of the crack-tip stress fields,
show that: (1) constraint relaxation at the crack tip
of shallow surface flaws results in increased data
scatter but no increase in the lower-bound fracture
toughness; (2) the nil ductility temperature performs
better than the reference temperature for nil ductility
transition as a normalizing parameter for shallow-flaw
fracture toughness data; (3) biaxial loading can reduce
the shallow-flaw fracture toughness; (4) stress-based
dual-parameter fracture toughness correlations cannot
predict the effect of biaxial loading on shallow-flaw
fracture toughness, because in-plane stresses at the
crack tip are not influenced by biaxial loading; and
(5) an implicit strain-based dual-parameter fracture
toughness correlation can predict the effect of biaxial
loading on shallow-flaw fracture toughness.  The
results of experimental irradiation investigations are
also included.

PRODUCTION AND EMISSION OF NITROUS OXIDE IN A SEWAGE
TREATMENT PLANT

This translation from Sweden (the Swedish Environmental
Research Institute) concerns nitrous oxide emissions
from a sewage treatment plant.  Calculations are made
using a `stagnant film' model.  The results show an
increased concentration of nitrous oxide in the
atmosphere above the denitrification zone.  The
concentration is about 25-times higher than the
background concentration in the atmosphere.  The high
concentration in the atmosphere shows evidence that
there is production and emission of nitrous oxide from
the denitrification zone.  This is also supported by
the measured concentration in the water that is
supersaturated, compared with the theoretical
concentration based on equilibrium between the
atmosphere and water.  The report discusses the effects
of active mixing by pumping air into the water at
different zones.

CORRELATION OF FRACTURE TOUGHNESS WITH IMPURITY
COMPONENTS

This (Los Alamos National Laboratory) report concerns
the phenomenon of stress-assisted diffusion in cracked
structures operating in corrosive environments.  It
discusses work done on extending the existing "Coupled
Thermomechanical Diffusion" theory, to enable
prediction of diffusion of a solute species in stressed
solids in the presence of cracks.  Mathematical
formalism is provided to support the intuitive notion
that a singular solution for the concentration field
can exist in crack tip neighborhoods, driven by
singular solutions for stresses that have been obtained
within the framework of classical linear elastic
fracture mechanics.  It is shown that under certain
limiting assumptions, a singular solution for the
concentration profile emerges from the governing
equations.  Both steady state and transient solutions
are obtained.  A numerical simulation using the
quarter-point finite-element method is carried out, and
the results obtained also indicate the presence of this
singularity. (This 1992 report was only recently
released for public use.)

PROPERTIES AND CREEP RUPTURE BEHAVIOR OF SILICONIZED
SILICON CARBIDE AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES

This (Pennsylvania State University) report
investigates the long-term load bearing capability of
two siliconized silicon carbides for high-temperature
applications (up to 1350 C).  These materials are
Norton NC430 and CS101K.  The NC430 is an earlier
more expensive material that requires an extra
furnacing operation during processing.  Batch-to-batch
variation in the microstructure of CS101K results in
large differences in creep rate and time-to-failure for
that material.  The results clearly show that details
of the rupture of siliconized silicon carbides depend
on the degree of interconnectivity of the silicon
carbide skeletal framework and also the
volume-fractions of the silicon carbide and silicon
phases.  (This 1991 report was only recently released

REACTION SYNTHESIS OF FE-AL ALLOYS: EFFECTS OF
PROCESSING VARIABLES

The effects of alloy composition and reaction
atmosphere on reaction synthesis of binary FeAl alloys
are discussed in this (Oak Ridge National Laboratory)
paper.  Reactions are observed in an open-air furnace,
under static vacuum (in an evacuated quartz tube), and
in a dynamic vacuum furnace.  High-speed videotapes of
reaction syntheses of compacts formed from 45(mu)m Fe
and 10(mu)m Al powders reacted in air and under static
vacuum, reveal that an unusual two-stage reaction
exists in this system under these conditions.  The
first stage of the two-stage reaction lasts several
seconds, and starts at around 650 C.  The second stage
begins at about 900 C, reaching temperatures between
1250 C and 1350 C.  The progress of the reaction to the
second stage is sensitive to the alloy composition and
reaction environment.  The reaction behavior is
explained in terms of thermodynamics and heat transfer,
which control the delicate balance between heat
accumulation and heat loss during reaction synthesis.

IMPROVED DAMAGE-MOTION RELATIONSHIPS USED IN REGIONAL
EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE AND LOSS STUDIES

This (National Center for Earthquake Engineering
Research) report provides improved damage-motion
relationships that can be used in regional earthquake
damage and loss studies.  Three main areas for
modification of the existing ATC-13 damage probability
matrices are investigated.  The first develops detailed
descriptions of the original 90 building classes
defined in ATC-13.  The second approach for modifying
the motion-damage relationships is through the
collection of existing data.  The third modification
considers the development of fragility formulations
based on information from the ATC-13 damage probability
matrices.  A log-normal function is fitted through the
fragility curve to enable easy implementation of the
fragility curves.

SYNTHESIZING CARBON-FILAMENT-REINFORCED ALUMINUM-MATRIX
COMPOSITES

This (Pennsylvania State University) report concerns
the synthesizing of branched (3-D) carbon filaments
from natural gas in a graphite tube, for subsequent
infiltration with aluminum.  A deposition reactor is
fabricated in which carbon filaments can be grown on
the inside surface of net-shaped parts.  A vertical
arrangement of the furnace is found to optimize
filament growth, and palladium is found to catalyze the
growth of filaments.  The diameter of the filaments
grown from the vapor phase is proportional to the
radius of the metal catalyst particle, and this has an
impact on the structure of the filaments.  The optimum
processing route involves Pd powder deposited on the
surface of a graphite substrate using an alcohol
solution to disperse the powder.

TENSILE DAMAGE PREDICTION FOR CERAMIC-MATRIX COMPOSITES
UNDER HIGH TEMPERATURE

This (City College of New York) report documents
experimental and theoretical results obtained in
studying the tensile damage behavior of ceramic-matrix
composites (namely Nicalon/CAS II composites) at room
and elevated temperature.  The composite specimens are
machined into dog-bone shape and polished to increase
the efficacy of observation in the scanning electron
microscope (SEM).  The specimens are placed inside the
chamber of an SEM and subjected to tensile loading at
room and higher temperatures up to 700 C.  At each
temperature, the load is increased until failure of the
specimen; the progression of damage is observed and
recorded from first crack to total failure.  Damage
usually starts with matrix cracking, followed by
debonding along fiber-matrix interface, fiber pull-out,
and finally fiber breakage.  At each load level the
displacement is measured, resulting in a stress-strain
curve having linear and non-linear portions.  Similar
behavior is observed at higher temperatures.
Theoretical models are developed to predict and
simulate the observed behavior.

USE OF BETA-ALUMINA AS A WEAK INTERFACE IN
ALUMINA-FIBER COMPOSITES

This (Rockwell International) report presents results
from a three-year study aimed at identifying and
developing suitable inter-phase materials for
oxide-oxide composites that are stable in high
temperature oxidizing environments, yet sufficiently
weak to allow debonding as required for toughening.
Most of the effort is devoted to two systems: LaPO4
(monazite); and beta-aluminas.  Monazite satisfies all
of the requirements for an inter-phase in
alumina-alumina composites (and most likely many other
ceramic matrix-fiber combinations).  It has a high
melting point (2074 C); it is stable with alumina at
high temperature in both oxidizing and slightly
reducing environments; and it forms a sufficiently weak
bond with alumina.  Beta-alumina materials, which
possess weak mica-like planes in their crystal
structures, are phase compatible with alumina, and
their debonding characteristics are adequate.  However,
their use and fabrication temperatures are limited by
morphological instability of the fiber/matrix interface
(i.e, grain growth of the beta-alumina platelets into
the fibers).

PREDICTING THE LIFE OF COMPOSITE LAMINATES: CONSTANT
AMPLITUDE AND TWO-STRESS-LEVEL FATIGUE

A strength-based wear-out model is presented in this
(Wright Laboratory) report.  It is used to predict the
residual strength and life of composite laminates
subjected to constant amplitude or two-stress-level
fatigue loadings.  It is assumed: that the laminate
undergoes proportional loading; that its residual
strength is a monotonically decreasing function of the
number of loading cycles; and that the probability of
failure after an arbitrary number of cycles may be
represented by a two-parameter Weibull function.  The
model also incorporates a cycle-mix-factor to account
for the degradation of strength and life that may be
associated with frequent changes in the stress
amplitude of the loading.  Experimental results from
two-stress-level loadings are used to evaluate the
model's predictive capability for sequencing effects,
as in a low-high or high-low test, and for cycle-mix
effects, as in a low-high-low-high repeating test.
Good correlation between theory and experiments is
obtained for all loadings and laminates studied.

THERMOMECHANICAL FATIGUE BEHAVIOR OF CONTINUOUS-FIBER
CERAMIC COMPOSITES

The thermomechanical fatigue behavior of three
continuous-fiber ceramic composites is examined in this
(NYMA Corp.) report.  The three matrices consist of two
different glass-ceramics and silicon carbide,
respectively.  The matrices of some of the specimens
with the silicon carbide matrix are enhanced to improve
oxidation resistance.  All three are reinforced with
Nicalon fibers having various fiber architectures.  The
thermoelastic properties of the matrix relative to the
fibers, the elastic moduli, and coefficients of thermal
expansion, are different in each composite, providing a
comparison of the effects of these critical properties.
The specimens are tested under in-phase and
out-of-phase cyclic loadings, with respect to thermal
cycling between 600 C and 1100 C.

DETECTION OF MACHINING DAMAGE IN CERAMICS USING THERMAL
WAVE IMAGING

Evaluation of the feasibility of a thermal wave imaging
technique for the detection and characterization of
machining damage in ceramics is presented in this
(NIST) report.  A well-defined crack system produced by
Vickers indentation is used to examine the
characteristic response of thermal wave signals to
different forms of cracks (i.e. median/radial and
lateral).  The results clearly indicate that thermal
wave imaging can be used for the detection of surface
and subsurface cracks in ceramics.  Thermal wave
imaging is then conducted on the surfaces of ground
alumina and the cross-section of scratched silicon
nitride.  Careful examinations of the thermal wave
images confirm that this technique can be used to
detect grinding-induced subsurface microcracks.  The
report discusses the limitations of the thermal wave
imaging technique in the detection of small cracks, and
precautions regarding choosing appropriate sets of
imaging parameters.

LOW-EXPANSION CERAMICS HAVING STRENGTH RETENTION AT
ELEVATED TEMPERATURES

The development of advanced engines has resulted in the
need for new ceramic compositions that exhibit
thermomechanical properties suitable for the engine
environment, i.e., low thermal expansion, stability to
1200 C, and thermal shock resistance.  This (Oak Ridge
National Laboratory) report discusses a two-phase
research program.  In the first phase, new oxide
ceramics are identified in the AlPO4-beta-eucryptite,
beta-cristobalite, mullite, and zircon systems.  The
research focuses on screening and property
characterization of ceramics in thse four systems.  The
most promising AlPO4-beta-eucryptite and zircon systems
compositions are then further evaluated and developed
in the second phase, with the goal of making them ready
for prototype testing in actual engines.

MEASUREMENT OF AIR EXCHANGE IN BUILDINGS

Air exchange measurements in buildings are important
for testing the effectiveness of the ventilation system
and for characterizing air leakage in the building
envelope when the ventilation is off.  This (Cold
Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory) report
discusses air-exchange measurements in a hospital,
administrative and maintenance buildings, barracks, and
a laboratory.  Using a tracer gas method that entails
releasing a tracer gas in an initial well-mixed
concentration, it then monitors tracer gas
concentration over time.  The faster the tracer gas
dilutes, the greater is the air change rate.  ASTM
standard E741 offers techniques for tracer gas
measurements in single-zone enclosures, but most
buildings are multiple-zone enclosures.  The study,
looks at whether such buildings could approximate
single-zone enclosures for tracer gas measurements.

MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF DEFORMATION DURING HOT ROLLING
OF STEEL

The deformation that occurs in the roll bite during the
hot rolling of steel, particularly the strain rate and
strain distribution, is mathematically modeled using
finite-element analysis (by EG& G Idaho).  Three
different finite-element models are compared with one
another and with industrial measurements.  The first
model is an Eulerian analysis based on the flow
formulation method; the second utilizes an updated
Lagrangian approach; the third is based on a
commercially available program, DEFORM, which also
utilizes a Lagrangian reference frame.  Roll forces
predicted by the model are compared with industrial
rolling loads from a seven-stand hot-strip mill.

DEVELOPMENT OF LOW DIELECTRIC ALUMINA-BASED CERAMICS
FOR MICROELECTRONIC SUBSTRATES

This Doctoral thesis (from Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory) deals with the development of low
dielectric-constant alumina-based ceramics for use as
microelectronic substrates.  The performance of
high-speed computers depends not only on IC (integrated
circuit) chips, but also on the signal propagation
speed between these chips.  The signal propagation
delay in a computer is determined by the dielectric
constant of the substrata material to which the IC
chips are attached.  This work develops a ceramic
substrate having a low dielectric constant
(k = approx. 5.0).  When compared with traditional
alumina substrata (k = approx. 10.0), the new material
corresponds to a 37% decrease in the signal propagation
delay.

Glass hollow-spheres are used to introduce porosity
(k = 1.0) to the alumina matrix in a controlled manner.
A surface coating technique, involving heterogeneous
nucleation in aqueous solution, is used to improve the
high-temperature stability of these spheres.  After
sintering at 1400 C: the isolated spherical pores are
uniformly distributed in the almost fully-dense alumina
matrix; negligible amounts of matrix defects are seen;
and all of the pores are isolated from each other.
Detailed analyses of the chemical composition find that
the sintered sample consists of alpha-alumina, mullite,
and residual glass.  Mullite is the chemical reaction
product of alumina and the glass spheres.  Residual
glass exists because the current firing conditions do
not complete the mullitization reaction.

The dielectric constant of the sintered sample is
measured and compared with the predicted value, using
Maxwell's model.  Mechanical strength is evaluated by a
four-point bending test.  Although the flexural
strength decreases exponentially with porosity, samples
having 34% porosity (k = approx. 5.0) still maintain
adequate mechanical strength for the proper operation
of a microelectronic substrate.
