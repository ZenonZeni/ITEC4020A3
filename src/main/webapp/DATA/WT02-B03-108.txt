<html><title>Hospital Meridian Visit Arrangements</title><h1>Arranging Your Visit to Hospital
Meridian</h1><h2>Travel Plans and Arrival Scheduling:</h2>Call the
<strong>Gerson Institute</strong> at <strong>619-585-7600</strong> to
arrange admission to the hospital.  Occasionally there is a waiting
list for admission, so please call as soon as you know your intended
arrival date. If possible, please have your flight information
available when you call.<p>Book your flight to arrive at the San
Diego airport in the morning. You can arrive any weekday.  Experienced
Gerson Therapy (tm) physicians are available at Hospital Meridian
seven days a week to provide the best possible care.  If a restricted
ticket will reduce airfare costs, in most cases a letter from your
physician will allow you to make a change in the return date without
penalty. (Check with your airline to confirm.)<p>You will be picked
up either by Meridian staff or by a local transportation service at
the Travelers Aid desk about 15 minutes after your scheduled arrival
time.  After loading your bags, the driver will transport you
directly to Hospital Meridian. The transportation cost is $60.00 for
2 people, $70.00 for 3 people or $75.00 for 4 people.<p>If you miss
your flight, or need to make changes in your arrival time, please
call the <strong>Car and Driver</strong> at
<strong>619-278-9441</strong>.  <p>After hours or on weekends, please
call Meridian directly, at <strong>011-52-66-80-13-58.</strong></html><p><h3>HOME SET UP COSTS:</h3><li>3 months' supply

AHEAD</h3><p>Your ongoing food costs may be considerably higher than
you might guess, ranging from $200 to $500 per WEEK (depending on
where you live, seasonal supplies, and the costs of shipping). Please

organically grown foods. Food Coops.<li>Health food stores with
organic produce sections<li>Shipping houses.</ul><p><h3>SPECIAL
HELPERS</h3><p>If you are non-ambulatory and are unable to feed or
bathe yourself,you must bring your SPECIAL HELPER with you.  Private
nursing is NOT supplied by the treatment center and cannot substitute
for your personal special helper who must learn the Gerson Therapy
from the patient's point of view. In such cases, it is wise to think
of having BOTH a companion AND a special helper since both will be
needed at home. If the above applies, please discuss your case with
the Gerson Institute.<p><h3>TAX</h3><p>All services may be subject to
all applicable local taxes.<p><ul>PATIENT CHECK LIST - WHAT TO BRING
