Canada: Immigration Goals-Reality Gap</h2>

<ul>


<p>

The ruling Liberal Party government in Canada promised to keep

annual immigration at one percent of the population, which would imply about

300,000 immigrants per year, but the government in October 1995 announced that

Canada's immigration target would be 220,000 immigrants in 1997.  Canada

imposes a $975 landing fee on arriving immigrants.<p>

Canada had a national origins immigration policy and had a 99 percent

European-origin population until 1967 when immigration was opened to Asians and

Latin Americans.  In 1980, about 150,000 immigrants arrived in Canada.

Immigration fell to 80,000 per year in the mid-1980s and rose to over 250,000

per year in the early 1990s.  By the year 2000, an estimated 18 percent of

Canada's residents will be "visible minorities."<p>

Canada in November announced that it had broken up a smuggling ring that

was bringing 30 to 40 southeast Asians each month to Toronto for $30,000 to

$35,000 each.  Another gang brought Chinese immigrants to the US via Bangkok

and Hong Kong to Vancouver.  Most applied for asylum in Vancouver, then

traveled east to be smuggled into the US through an Indian reservation that

straddles the border.<p>

Canada's economy is booming, but unemployment remains at about 10

percent--the longest stretch of unemployment above nine percent since the Great

Depression.  Federal and state governments have reduced spending.  Nine of the

10 provinces--all except British Columbia--have eliminated or are on target to

eliminate their budget deficits. <p>

Vancouver has the second-largest Chinese community in North America with

three Chinese daily papers, three mainly Chinese radio stations and two TV

stations.  Chinese immigrants are sometimes accused of cutting down the trees

on their lots, which prompted the city government to permit each neighborhood

to enact its own building codes.<p>
