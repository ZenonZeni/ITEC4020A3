E-MAIL TAP HELPS CLOSE CELLULAR FRAUD RING

Federal authorities, relying on the first-ever court-
approved wiretap of e-mail accounts, arrested and charged three
people with running one of the most sophisticated cellular fraud
rings uncovered so far.

Equipment seized by authorities included a cellular phone
that can eavesdrop on calls placed by other cellular phone users;
a small, easily-concealed device that steals legitimate users'
phone numbers by plucking them off the airwaves; and several
phones that could be programmed with up to 99 stolen numbers via
the phones' keypads, instead of using a separate personal
computer.

The high-tech nature of the gadgets underscores the growing
sophistication of cellular phone crimes. The wireless industry
says it loses about $500 million in revenue each year to thieves,
but independent observers estimate the loss is closer to $1
billion. With the boom in wireless services expected to continue
into the next decade, current crimes are adding urgency to the
industry's effort to crack down on fraud.

The three people arrested were charged with fraud relating
to access devices and conspiracy. One also was charged with money
laundering. -- The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, p. 16, "U.S.,
Using E-Mail Tap, Charges Three With Operating Cellular-Fraud
Ring"

FTC TELEMARKETING RULES TAKE EFFECT

Telemarketers who call consumers back after being told just
once not to call again can now face legal action under federal
rules that went into effect on Dec. 31, 1995. They are aimed at
cracking down on abusive sales practices.

The FTC said the rules were designed to give consumers an
easy-to-use toll to halt unwanted calls.

All consumers have to do to stop a telemarketer from calling
is simply ask the caller not to phone them again. If the firm
does call again, it is breaking the law and consumers should
report it to their state attorney general's office for action,
said the FTC.

The telemarketing sales rules also bar telemarketers from
calling consumers before 8 a.m. and after 9 p.m. When they do
call, telemarketers must tell the consumer that they are trying
to sell something before making the pitch.

Then, before consumers pay, the telemarketer must state the
total cost of the product or service they are offering and any
restrictions on getting or using them.

The rules also ban misrepresentations, tightly restrict the
telemarketing of credit repair services, and make it unlawful for
any company or individual to assist fraudulent telemarketing
behind the scenes. -- The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, p. 6, "FTC
Rules to Curb Telemarketing Abuse Took Effect Sunday"

FLA. IPP PROVIDERS RECEIVE QUARTERLY UPDATES

As of Jan. 1, 1996, IPP providers in Florida began receiving
quarterly notification from LECs of all NXX activity occurring
under the Land-to-Mobile (LTM) option.

The LTM option allows intraLATA direct-dialed long distance
calls to be treated as local for landline customers placing calls
to mobile numbers throughout an entire LATA. Calls that would
normally be billed as toll to the end user are reverse-billed by
the LEC to the mobile service provider on a usage-sensitive
basis. -- Perspectives, December, p. 37

UK RULING TO PROMOTE COMPETITION

Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission demolished a
barrier to increased competition in the U.K. telecom market when
it ruled that customers would be able to retain their phone
numbers when changing operators.

The decision sent a signal to British Telecom that
commission broadly supports the measures that promote
competition.

The MMC ruling settled a dispute between BT and the
regulator setting out a framework for how the costs of number
portability should be split between rival companies.

It said BT should bear 70% of the costs against 30% for the
new operator over the next five years. -- The Financial Times,
Dec. 15, p. 8, "Phone number ruling boosts for telecom
competition"

MCI VIDEOPHONE USES TVS, PHONE LINES

MCI's VideoPhone enables consumers to convert their TVs into
telephones.

The VideoPhone is designed as a set-top box connected to the
television and phone line. Using data compression techniques, the
MCI product transports audio and video signals across the country
via regular phone lines, for the same cost as a regular long
distance call.

Customers can select the screen size, operate the unit by
remote control; select from a variety of on-screen commands; hold
videoconferences with multiple callers; and record conversations
onto VHS tape.

MCI estimates the VideoPhone will be on the market by June
1996 and will retail for approximately $1,300. The company also
intends to offer leasing options. -- Communications Industries
Report, December, p. 12, "MCI Videophone Uses TVs & Standard
Phone Lines"

NEWBRIDGE HELPS TELCOS PROFIT FROM THE NET

Newbridge Networks, a supplier of broadband switches to
public network carriers, unveiled a line of products to enable
service providers to offer Internet access easily and to beef up
their backbone networks to handle the explosion in Internet
traffic.

The approach includes both access and backbone products, as
well as a single network management system designed to let
service providers easily operate their networks from a
centralized, remote location. The new product family builds on
existing Newbridge products, notably asynchronous transfer mode
(ATM) switches, and adds new Internet access products.

Newbridge is aiming its Internet products at telephone
companies, Internet service providers and private corporations,
but will likely start with the phone companies that have already
started buying the Newbridge ATM switch line. -- Interactive
Week, Dec. 18, p. 20, "Newbridge Helps Phone Firms Capitalize on
Net"

PAGERS AREN'T JUST FOR MESSAGES

Data Critical Corp., an Oklahoma City company developing
ways to transmit urgent data over pagers, is developing a method
to let hospitals send electrocardiograms, via pager, to mobile
cardiologists. The cost is $25,000 to set up a system serving
five doctors, and Hewlett-Packard sells the hardware.

The Data Critical system consists of HP personal computers
situated in emergency rooms, loaded with the right software to
compress the data files, encrypt them, then transmit these to a
pager network. The other end of the system is equivalent to a
standard belt-mounted pager equipped with a connector link for an
HP 200 LX, a palm-top computer. The pager receives the data file
wherever the cardiologist is and feeds it into the tiny computer.
The computer decompresses the data and displays the EKG on a
high-resolution screen.

Data Critical is moving on to other applications. FBI agents
are experimenting with the gear. And more developments are made
possible by PCS (personal communications system) paging
frequencies auctioned off by the federal government last year.
PCS uses two-way transmissions, making possible brief responses
and acknowledgments. -- Forbes Magazine, Jan. 1, "Pagers aren't
just for messages to call the office. You can practice medicine
or trade stocks with them"

INTERNET GROWTH HIGH IN '95

If brilliant realizations really did appear as light bulbs
flashing above people's heads, 1995 would have been an especially
bright year for the information and telecom industry. Company
after company came to understand that their futures were at least
partly linked to the Internet.

Microsoft announced that it was redefining itself an
Internet company. AT&T declared that it, too, wanted to be an
Internet company. IBM announced an ambitious Internet strategy.
And America Online set a new course for the Internet.

The awakening of the information and telecom giants means
that even the most nimble of the Internet companies will have to
be careful to avoid being trampled as the rush to cyberspace
intensifies this year.

While companies like Netcom and PSINet, which recognized the
potential of Internet access before most others, have earned the
right to compete with AT&T and MCI, hundreds of smaller Internet
services providers are looking for new partners, new markets or
new jobs. This is in part because of the expected competition
from telephone and cable companies.   -- New York Times, Jan. 2,
p. C14, "Rough-and-Ready Time in the Internet Business"
