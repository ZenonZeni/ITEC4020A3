Report No. CC 96-10             COMMON CARRIER ACTION                  March 25, 1996    


COMMON CARRIER BUREAU CLARIFIES AND EXTENDS REQUEST FOR COMMENT
ON ACTA PETITION RELATING TO "INTERNET PHONE" SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE - RM No. 8775</CENTER>
                                        

Comments Due:     May 8, 1996
Replies Due:      June 8, 1996


On March 4, 1996, America's Carriers Telecommunication Association (ACTA) filed a Petition for
Declaratory Ruling, Special Relief, and Institution of a Rulemaking relating to the provision of
interstate and international interexchange telecommunications service via the "Internet" by
non-tariffed, uncertified entities.  ACTA alleges that providers of "Internet phone" software 
and hardware are operating as uncertified and unregulated common carriers, in contravention of 
FCC rules, and seeks three forms of relief.  First, ACTA seeks a declaratory ruling establishing
the Commission's authority over interstate and international telecommunications services using 
the Internet.  Second, ACTA asks the Commission for special relief: to order named and unnamed
respondents immediately to stop provisioning Internet phone software and hardware without
complying with the regulatory requirements of the Communications Act of 1934.  Finally, ACTA 
urges the Commission to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider rules governing the use of
the Internet for the provision of telecommunications services.

On March 8, 1996, a public notice was issued seeking comment on ACTA's petition for rulemaking.
When petitions for rulemaking are filed with the Commission, a public notice is routinely issued
shortly after the petition is filed.  The Commission's goal in seeking comment is to develop a
record on which to base a decision about whether or not the issues raised by the outside party
merit consideration.  
 
We hereby establish a consolidated pleading cycle for all of ACTA's requests.  This proceeding
will be treated as non-restricted for purposes of the Commission's ex parte rules.  See generally
47 C.F.R. 1.1200-1.1216.

Because of the complex issues implicated by the ACTA petition, the deadlines for filing comments
on the petition are hereby extended.  All comments on ACTA's petition should be filed on or before
May 8, 1996, and all reply comments should be filed on or before June 8, 1996.  Commenters should
file an original and four copies of their comments with the Office of the Secretary, Federal
Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, N.W., Room 222, Washington, D.C. 20554.  A copy
should also be sent to Wanda Harris, Common Carrier Bureau, FCC, Room 518, 1919 M Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20554, and to the Commission's contractor for public service records duplication:
ITS, Inc., 2100 M Street, N.W., Suite 140, Washington, D.C.  20037.  Informal comments in this
proceeding may also be filed via electronic mail to <a href = "mailto:rm8775@fcc.gov">rm8775@fcc.gov</a>. All filings in this
non-docketed proceeding should reference RM No. 8775.  The full text of the petition, and the
comments and reply comments will be available for inspection and duplication during regular
business hours in the FCC Reference Center, Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street,
N.W., Room 239, Washington, D.C. 20554.  Copies may also be obtained from International
Transcription Service, Inc. (ITS, Inc.), 2100 M Street, N.W., Suite 140, Washington, D.C.  20037
(202/857-3800).  This public notice and additional information on filing comments will be
available on the Internet through the "recent actions" section of the Common Carrier Bureau home
page at <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/ccb.html">http://www.fcc.gov/ccb.html</A>.
