WHAT IS BIPOLAR DISORDER?<P>
  
Bipolar disorder, which is also known as manic-depressive illness and will be
called by both names throughout this publication--is a mental illness involving
episodes of serious mania and depression. The person's mood usually swings from
overly "high" and irritable to sad and hopeless and then back again, with
periods of normal mood in between.<P>

Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood and
continues throughout life. It is often not recognized as an illness, and people
who have it may suffer needlessly for years or even decades.<P>

Effective treatments are available that greatly alleviate the suffering caused
by bipolar disorder and can usually prevent its devastating complications.
These include marital break-ups, job loss, alcohol and drug abuse, and suicide.<P>

The following information on bipolar disorder is from <a href=http://www.cais.com/vikings/nami/disorder/disord1.htm#bipol> the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI)</a>.<P>


BIPOLAR DISORDER AND DEPRESSION<P>
   
Almost one-third of six-to-twelve-year-old children diagnosed with
   major depression will develop bipolar disorders within a few years,
   according to a study of 79 depressed children over two-to-five years
   reported in the May 1994 issue of the Journal of the American Academy
   of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Most became bipolar before the
   onset of puberty, and 32% became bipolar at an average age of 11
   years.<BR>
   
   The researchers recommend that those caring for depressed children
   should be on the lookout for symptoms of manic-depressive illness.
   They also suggested that--because antidepressants may worsen certain
   forms of manic illness in adults--prescribing antidepressants for
   children should be done with care.<P>

  Intended for personnel in programs serving persons with developmental 
disabilities, the booklet provides basic information about the major psychiatric 
disorders and their treatment.  Five sections cover: the major disorders; 
medications--uses and problems; assessment; cooordination of services; and 
psychiatric emergencies.  Major disorders such as schizophrenia and affective 
illness, bipolar disorder, and depression are described.  Commonly used 
antipsychotic and antidepressant medications are listed by both generic and 
trade names, and side effects are explained.  Four steps of assessment are 
recommended: (1) obtain informed consent from the client or guardian; (2) 
obtain medical and psychiatric history; (3) obtain a social history; and (4) 
obtain verification that the client has had a recent physical examination.  
Coordination of services including those of a physician, a therapist, a source 
of expert information on medications, and an inpatient facility is urged.  
Finally, appropriate immediate management of a psychiatric emergency is 
discussed.  Six references.  (DB)<BR>

  This booklet describes the symptoms, forms, causes, and treatment of 
depression, with particular focus on depression in children, adolescents, and 
older adults.  Symptoms include: persistent sad or "empty" mood; feelings of 
hopelessness, guilt, or helplessness; loss of interest in ordinary activities; 
sleep disturbances; eating disturbances; thoughts of death or suicide; and 
restlessness and irritability.  Among the disorders several forms are major 
clinical depression, dysthymia, bipolar depression (also called manic-
depressive disorder), or a combination of disorders.  Causes include genetic, 
biochemical, and environmental factors.  Treatments include drug, psychosocial, 
and electroconvulsive therapy, and (still under study) experimental treatments. 
Childhood depression may go unrecognized when combined with other types of 
behavior such as hyperactivity or delinquency.  Depression appears to be 
occurring more commonly among teenagers, whose symptoms are sometimes 
attributed to the "normal adjustments" of adolescence.  Symptoms of depressed 
older adults are often misdiagnosed as senility or everyday problems of the 
aged.  The depressed person can be helped by family and friends who maintain as 
normal a relationship as possible, point out distorted thinking without being 
critical or disapproving, acknowledge that the depressed individual is 
suffering and in pain, and express affection.  Family and friends should not 
blame the depressed person for his or her condition or say or do anything to 
exacerbate a poor self-image.  (CB)<BR>

  Depression is defined as a "whole-body" illness, involving the body, mood, 
and thoughts.  Three of the most prevalent types of depressive disorders are 
described: major depression, dysthymia, and bipolar disorders (formerly called 
manic-depressive illness).  Eleven symptoms of depression and 10 symptoms of 
mania are listed.  Causes of depression are discussed, focusing on genetic, 
psychological, and environmental factors.  Diagnostic evaluation and treatment 
are described.  The components of a diagnostic evaluation are discussed.  
Antidepressant medications are reviewed, focusing on tricyclics, monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors, and lithium.  It is noted that antidepressants are not 
habit-forming and that antianxiety drugs are not antidepressants.  Side effects 
of antidepressants are discussed and ways to deal with them are presented.  
Psychotherapies are discussed, including the issues involved in short-term 
therapy, behavior therapy, and psychodynamic therapy.  Information on self-help 
is presented, including realizing that depressive disorders make one feel 
exhausted, worthless, helpless, and hopeless.  Advice is given on what actions 
to take or not to take when one is depressed.  Information on how to help 
depressed persons is discussed.  This includes helping the depressed person to 
get diagnosis and treatment and offering emotional support.  Addresses of 
groups providing information are included.  (ABL)<BR>

  Emerging from Depression: Treatment of Adolescent Depression Using the Major 
Treatment Models of Adult Depression.<BR>

  Noting that adolescents who commit suicide are often clinically depressed, 
this paper examines various approaches in the treatment of depression.  Major 
treatment models of adult depression, which can be directly applied to the 
treatment of the depressed adolescent, are described.  Major treatment models 
and selected research studies are reviewed in the areas of: (1) cognitive 
therapy; (2) cognitive and behavior therapy; (3) cognitive therapy with 
pharmacotherapy; (4) the use of pharmacotherapy for acute depression; (5) 
treatment of manic depression with lithium; (6) the use of lithium in learning 
and behavior problems; and (7) reality therapy.  The paper concludes that a 
combination of therapies may be needed to treat depressed adolescents: one 
therapy may be needed to treat the condition immediately, especially if the 
teenager is suicidal, and another therapy may be needed later to alter 
cognitive distortions and to encourage responsible choices in coping with 
life's problems.  (NB)<BR>

  A Personality Profile of Oppositional Children as Measured on Selected Scales 
of the Personality Inventory for Children.<BR>

  By means of 12 selected subscales of the Personality Inventory for Children 
(PIC), which were used to plot profiles, this study investigated personality 
characteristics of oppositional children.  In general, oppositional children 
are children who do not do what is asked of them.  In particular, oppositional 
behavior consists of at least 6 months of disobedient, negativistic, and 
provocative opposition to authority figures which is manifested in at least two 
of the following five symptoms: (1) violations of minor rules; (2) temper 
tantrums; (3) argumentativeness; (4) provocative behavior; and (5) stubbornness.
Participants, who completed a 600-item PIC, were the parents of 43 oppositional 
children and 57 compliant children.  Their children were between 6 and 12 years 
of age.  Findings suggest that oppositional children may be psychologically 
maladjusted, have problems in school achievement, be depressed, and tend to 
come from ineffective families which lack cohesion.  Such children may display 
delinquent tendencies and be somewhat withdrawn.  Oppositional children appear 
to be anxious and to display some features that are similar to those exhibited 
by children with psychosis.  Oppositional children are often overactive, but 
not when they are severely depressed.  These children may also lack social 
skills and may not have effective social relations.  (RH)<BR>
