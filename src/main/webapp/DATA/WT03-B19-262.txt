<h2>Taxation</h2>
<P>
Taxes in Australia are levied by Commonwealth, State and local governments. There is no value-added tax in Australia, no estate or gift taxes and no separate social security level, although a Medicare levy of 1.5% of taxable income is payable.

<BR>
<I>Personal income tax</I>
<P>
Income tax is levied only by the Commonwealth Government and is assessed on 
companies, trustees and individuals. Income subject to tax assessment under 
the Income Tax Assessment Act includes wages, professional fees, profits, 
dividends, rental income, interest and royalties.
<P>
Income tax is self-assessed. Residents pay tax on income derived both within 
Australia and overseas. However, income derived from overseas by Australian 
residents on which foreign tax has been paid is either exempt from Australian 
tax or it attracts a tax credit.
<P>
The marginal rates of personal income tax for 1995-96 for residents and 
non-residents are:

<P>
<I>Corporate income tax</I>
<P>
The Commonwealth Government levies company tax at the rate of 36%. Corporate profits of either a subsidiary or a branch of an overseas company are taxed at the company rate.
<P>
<I>Dividend imputation</I>
<P>
A dividend imputation system relieves company income distributed to resident 
individual shareholders from double taxation. Franked dividends, that is, 
dividends paid from company income which has been taxed, carry either a full 
or a partial imputation credit for shareholders. The shareholder who pays 
personal income tax at a marginal rate of less than the company tax rate 
receives fully-franked dividend income free of tax because company tax has 
already been paid at the company level, and receives a tax credit which 
enables him/her to reduce tax payable on other income in the relevant tax 
year. The shareholder whose personal marginal tax rate exceeds the company 
tax rate is required to pay income tax to make up the difference between the 
two rates.
<P>
Fully-franked dividends are exempt from dividend withholding tax. In the case 
of partially-franked dividends, the balance of any dividend that is unfranked 
is subject to a 30% dividend withholding tax, or 15% (usually) if the 
shareholder is a resident of a country which has a double taxation agreement 
with Australia.
<P>
<I>Taxation of foreign source income</I>
<P>
Low-taxed passive income (e.g. dividends, interest and royalties) derived by 
Australian-controlled foreign companies (CFCs) and through certain trusts may 
be attributed to shareholders or beneficiaries and taxed in Australia on an 
accruals basis. A non-resident company is defined as a CFC if a control test 
is satisfied. Income is usually attributed only to shareholders with a 
substantial interest of 10% or more in a CFC.
<P>
Attribution of the passive income derived by a CFC depends on the country of 
residence of the CFC. Most passive income derived by a company resident in a 
country with a tax system comparable to Australia's is outside the CFC regime, 
and dividends from subsidiaries in such countries are exempt from tax in 
Australia. Countries included in the list of comparable-tax jurisdictions are 
determined by several criteria, such as whether direct taxation is levied on 
income or profits, whether the tax base is comprehensive, whether special tax 
incentives facilitate international profit shifting and whether the corporate 
income tax rate is at least 25%. Some countries may be given a qualified 
listing where designated tax concessions are identified. Passive income that 
has benefited from a designated tax concession will normally be attributable.
<P>
Where a country is not listed as a comparable tax jurisdiction, the passive 
income of the company will generally be attributable to shareholders unless 
it is 5% or less of the CFCs gross turnover. 
<P>
Income to be attributed to Australian shareholders is calculated according to 
Australian tax law and, for this purpose, CFCs are treated as if they are 
Australian residents.
<P>
The foreign investment fund (FIF) measures, which apply accruals taxation 
to certain non-controlling interests held by Australian resident trusts, 
took effect in January 1993. The measures also apply to certain foreign life 
assurance policies that have an investment component, such as life bonds.
<P>
Generally, all other non-export foreign income not attributed under the CFC 
or FIF measures is taxed on remittance to Australia under the foreign tax 
credit system. A resident taxpayer whose assessable income includes foreign 
income is entitled to a credit for the amount of foreign tax paid, up to the 
limit of the amount of Australian tax that would have been payable if the 
income were derived in Australia.
<P>
<I>Pooled Development Funds (PDFs)</I>
<P>
PDFs are a new type of investment company that attract a concessional corporate 
tax rate of 15% (see <A HREF="commgovserv.html#pdf">Pooled Development Funds</A>).
<P>
<I>Offshore Banking Units</I>
<P>
Taxable income derived from pure offshore banking transactions by an authorised 
offshore banking unit in Australia is effectively taxed at the concessional 
rate of 10% from July 1992.
<P>
<I>Regional Headquarters</I>
<P>
Approved <A HREF="commgovserv.html#hdq">regional headquarters</A> are able to access certain tax exemptions and deductions.
<P>
<I>Deductions</I>
<P>
Business expenses: Expenses are generally deductible to the extent they are 
incurred in the production of assessable income or in carrying on a 
business for the purpose of producing assessable income. Ordinary business 
expenses include salaries, wages, purchases of trading stock, rents, lease 
costs, interest paid, bad debts, travelling costs, and repairs and maintenance.
<P>
Depreciation and amortisation: New plant and equipment is eligible to be 
depreciated at rates which are accelerated beyond effective life rates. 
Taxpayers may choose prime cost or diminishing value methods of depreciation 
although once depreciation has been claimed for an asset under one method 
it must continue to be depreciated under that method. The rates applying to 
plant and equipment acquired or commenced to be constructed after 26 
February 1992 and the corresponding implied write-off lives are:

<P>
Capital expenditure on the construction of industrial buildings is able to be 
written off at the rate of 4% per annum on a straight line basis. Other 
income-producing buildings and structural improvements are eligible to be 
written off at 2.5% per annum.
<P>
<I>Tax incentives</I>
<P>
Research and development tax concession: 
(see <A HREF="commgovserv.html#tinc">tax concession</A>).
<P>
Loss carry-forward: Losses incurred before 1 July 1989 may be carried forward 
for seven years. If incurred on or after that date, they may be carried 
forward indefinitely provided that more than 50% of the shares held in the 
loss carry-forward is used, or provided the company continues to carry on the 
same business it operated prior to the change in ownership. Capital losses may 
only be offset against capital gains. No provision is made for a carry-back of 
tax losses for offset against prior year income. Loss relief is available 
for companies within a group.
<P>
Treatment of groups of companies: Income losses incurred by a company wholly-owned by a resident group of companies may be transferred and offset against the taxable income of other profitable companies in the group. It is necessary for the loss company and the profit company to be in the same group of companies in the loss year, the transfer year and any intervening period. Group companies are defined to be companies that are 100% owned by the same parent. It is not necessary that resident group companies be owned by an Australian holding company provided they ultimately share a common overseas parent.
<P>
Capital losses may be transferred to other members of the group to be offset only against capital gains. Excess foreign tax credits may also be transferred.
<P>
<I>Capital gains tax</I>
<P>
The capital gains tax (CGT) generally applies only to capital gains realised on 
the disposal of assets acquired after 19 September 1985.
<P>
The CGT provisions are catch-all provisions - the provisions embrace not only 
capital gains as opposed to revenue gains but all gains that arise on the 
disposal of assets, subject to certain exceptions, exclusions and limitations. 
If the gain is also assessable as income under some other provision of the 
Act, then the amount of the capital gain is accordingly reduced.
<P>
Except for assets disposed of within 12 months of their acquisition, only real 
capital gains are assessed for taxation - this is achieved by indexing the 
cost base of an asset to the Consumer Price Index.
<P>
For CGT purposes, all capital gains and losses incurred during a year by a 
taxpayer are netted. If a net capital gain results, this is included in the 
taxpayer's assessable income; but if a net capital loss results, this is not 
deductible from assessable income but is carried forward to the next succeeding 
year of income and used in the calculation of the taxpayer's net capital gain 
or net capital loss for that year. It should be noted that the loss is carried 
forward without indexation.
<P>
Rollovers, that is, deferral of CGT liability when the ownership of an asset 
changes are allowed for certain involuntary asset disposals (including on the 
death of a taxpayer) and for certain business reorganisations in which the 
underlying ownership of the asset does not change or where the underlying 
assets against which the taxpayer has the claim do not change.
<P>
<I>Double taxation agreements</I>
<P>
Double taxation agreements (DTAs) operate to prevent double taxation by 
assigning taxing rights according to the source of income and residence of the 
taxpayer, and by limiting certain taxing rights between countries. DTAs also 
make provision for mutual agreement procedures where the DTA by itself cannot 
resolve a particular dispute, and contain provisions designed to enable 
countries to exchange information to combat avoidance and evasion. Australia 
has DTAs with the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, 
Singapore, Japan, France, Italy, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, 
Philippines, Switzerland, Malaysia, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Korea, Norway, 
Malta, Finland, Austria, China, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Fiji, 
Hungary, Kiribati, India, Poland, Indonesia, Spain and Vietnam. Australia also 
has airline profits agreements with France, Italy, Greece and China.
<P>
<I>Taxation of non-residents</I>
<P>
Non-residents are subject to Australian taxation on their Australian source 
income. This is generally subject to tax in the same way as the income of 
residents.
<P>
Foreign employees working in Australia for an Australian company are subject 
to tax on all earning from the company. Short-term visitors (less than 183 
days) do not qualify as residents for taxation purposes and are subject to 
income tax at rates applicable to non-resident taxpayers. Long-term visitors 
might qualify for consideration as residents of Australia for taxation purposes 
and would be subject to income tax at rates applicable to resident taxpayers.
<P>
The income of foreign employees working for foreign companies in Australia 
(subject to the provisions of Australias DTAs concerning the duration of 
employment) is taxable in Australia. The amount of tax payable will vary 
depending on whether the visitor is considered to be a resident or a 
non-resident for taxation purposes.
<P>
Dividends and royalties paid to non-residents are subject to a withholding tax 
of 30% (generally limited to 15% and 10% respectively in Australias DTAs). 
Non-residents are exempt from dividend withholding tax to the extent that the 
dividend is paid out of projects that have borne Australian income tax, that 
is, to the extent that they carry imputation credits. Interest withholding tax 
is generally levied at a flat rate of 10% on the gross amount of interest 
paid to non-residents.
<P>
<I>Wholesale sales tax</I>
<P>
The Commonwealth Government imposes a wholesale sales tax (WST) which 
generally applies to the last wholesale sale of goods that have not previously 
been used in Australia. WST also applies where goods are not sold by wholesale 
(for example, where they are sold by retail by a manufacturer or where a 
manufacturer applies the goods to his/her own use). WST is paid on the 
wholesale selling price of the goods or, where there is no wholesale sale, 
alternative values are used. Services are not subject to tax.
<P>
Rates of WST vary. As from 1 July 1995, the general rate of tax is 22%. 
However, a range of household goods (such as whitegoods and furnishings) and 
certain foods and beverages (for example, confectionery and fruit juices) are 
taxed at the concessional rate of 12%; certain goods (including furs, 
jewellery, TVs and stereos) are taxed at 32%, and luxury cars are taxed at a 
marginal rate of 45%.
<P>
In addition, many products are exempt from WST, including most food and 
clothing, medicines and books. Tobacco and petroleum are exempt from WST but 
are subject to customs and excise duties. Goods for use by certain bodies, 
such as government departments and public hospitals, may also be exempt, as 
are a wide range of goods for use as inputs to goods production.
<P>
People who deal in taxable goods must register and are generally required to 
lodge returns and pay tax on a monthly basis (21 days after the end of the 
month), although taxpayers whose annual WST liability is less than $53,959 
have the option of lodging returns on a quarterly basis. Importers are required 
to pay tax at the time of local entry. Registration is encouraged for 
businesses which do not deal in taxable goods to allow them to more easily 
gain exemption on their purchases of business inputs (such as primary 
producers which sell exempt goods and are allowed to purchase a wide range of 
equipment and materials exempt from WST).
<P>
<I>Customs and excise duties</I>
<P>
The Commonwealth Government imposes customs and excise duties. Excise duties 
apply to alcoholic beverages (but not wine), tobacco and petroleum fuels 
(although various rebates of excise are available in respect of diesel 
purchased for off-road use by certain users such as in mining and primary 
production.
<P>
In March 1991, the Commonwealth Government announced substantial changes to 
the assistance arrangements for manufacturing industries. There is a general 
program of tariff reductions, which began in 1988, with most higher tariffs 
phasing down to 5% by 1 July 1996; the import quotas applying to textiles, 
clothing and footwear (TCF) have been terminated; the bounties applying to 
certain TCF goods are to be phased out by 1995; and the tariffs applying to 
TCF and passenger motor vehicle (PMV) imports are to be substantially reduced 
by the year 2000.
<P>
<I>Fringe benefits tax</I>
<P>
Generally, any employer providing a non-cash benefit to an employee or an 
associated of the employee is subject to fringe benefits tax. If fringe 
benefits tax is paid by the employer, the benefits are not taxable in the 
hands of the employee. From 1 April 1994, fringe benefits tax became payable 
by the employer on the tax-inclusive value of any fringe benefits and fringe 
benefits tax became deductible for income tax purposes.
<P>
Examples of fringe benefits subject to this tax include:
<ul>
<li>car parking facilities provided to employees who use a car to commute to 
and from work;
<li>motor cars provided for employee's personal use;
<li>free or subsidised accommodation;
<li>low or interest-free loans;
<li>discounted goods or services provided by the employer in excess of a 
specified threshold;
<li>payment or reimbursement of private expenses on behalf of employees;
<li>waiver of employee loans or debts;
<li>a portion of a living-away-from-home allowance paid to an employee.
</ul>
<p>
The fringe benefits tax year-end is 31 March. The tax rate for the year 
commencing on 1 April 1995 is 48.475%. For those with a previous-year tax 
liability of $3,000 or more, tax is payable in quarterly instalments of 25% 
of the previous year's liability, with the balance payable when the annual 
return is filed. An employer generally must file an annual return by 28 April 
each year.
<p>
<B><I>Victorian State taxes</I></B>
<BR>
<I>Payroll tax</I>
<P>
Payroll tax is payable in all Australian States and Territories and is 
administered separately by each State, each having its own legislation with 
some differing provisions and exemptions levels.
<P>
In Victoria, payroll tax is a tax on wages (the definition of wages includes 
wages, salaries, remuneration, commission, bonuses, allowances and fringe 
benefits) paid or payable by an employer or deemed employer unless the wages 
are considered exempt under the Payroll Tax Act 1971. The rate of tax, since 1 
November 1990, stands at 7% and is payable when an employer's total Australian 
wages exceed the general exemption level, currently $42,917 per calendar month 
or $515,000 per annum.
<P>
<I>Stamp duties</I>
<P>
Stamp duty is a tax imposed on certain documents and transactions and is 
payable on documents affecting the purchase of various assets including land, 
shares and motor vehicles. In addition, there are also document duties on 
mortgages, leases of non-residential property and deeds. Transactions involving 
the hire of goods, life assurance and general insurance are also liable to duty.
<P>
In Victoria, duties charged vary with the type and value of the transaction or 
document. Most documents are charged stamp duty based on the total monetary 
value of the particular transaction. However, some documents are subject to a 
fixed or flat stamp duty charge.
<P>
Duty on property transfers are levied as follows:

<P>
<I>Land tax</I>
<P>
In Victoria, land tax is an annual tax on the unimproved value (municipal site 
value adjusted by an equalisation factor and excluding the value of buildings 
or other improvements) of all Victorian land owned by a landowner as at 
midnight on 31 December in the year prior to the year of assessment. Therefore, 
the amount of tax payable for 1995 is based upon the total unimproved value of 
all land owned at midnight on 31 December 1995.
<P>
Any owner possessing land solely, or jointly, with an unimproved value 
exceeding $200,000 must pay land tax unless the land is considered exempt 
under the Land Tax Act 1958. The scale for 1995 is set out in the following 
table:
<P>

<I>Miscellaneous Victorian taxes and duties</I>
<P>
There are also a number of other Victorian taxes and charges.
<P>
<I>Financial institutions duty (FID):</I> generally charged on all receipts of 
money by financial institutions at a rate of 0.06% of the amount received up to 
a maximum rate of $1200 on any one transaction.
<P>
A concessional rate of 0.005% applies to receipts of short-term dealings by 
registered short-term money market operators.
<P>
<I>Debits tax:</I> generally charged on all debits to accounts with cheque 
drawing facilities. The tax rate ranges from 30 cents for debits between $1 
to $100 and up to $4 for debits of $10,000 or more.
<P>
<B><I>Local government taxes and charges</I></B>
<P>
Local councils levy rates for the provision of services to property owners, 
such as garbage collection, the maintenance of roads and footpaths, and 
recreational and community services. Rates are set annually by each council, 
usually as a proportion of the net annual value (NAV) of land or the site 
value (which includes the value of improvements to land such as excavations, 
gradings, levellings). Some councils may vary the rate levied and the method of 
calculation according to the use to which the land is put.
