Privatisation can't cure sickness

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

CALCUTTA, Sept. 16. Disputes relating to availability of land for the
State's industrial growth should be solved amicably, the Chief
Minister, Mr Jyoti Basu said here today.

Some agricultural land must be acquired and this would not hurt the
State's agriculture. The State Government had recently set up a
high-power Cabinet committee to expedite decisions on all matters
relating to industrial promotion, he added.

Speaking at the 109th annual general meeting of the Bengal National
Chamber of Commerce, he said privatization was no panacea for sickness
in industries.

"How is it that as many as 450,000 private companies are sick?" Mr
Basu queried in justification of his contention.

He said that West Bengal would soon become the nation's top industrial
State with 10 per cent industrial growth.

Stating that his State now ranked third in the country, after Delhi
and Maharashtra, in terms of attracting foreign investments, the Chief
Minister said since the economic liberalization began in 1991, a total
of 1,239 proposals with an investment of Rs 27.741 crore came to West
Bengal.

Of this, 188 proposals were from the NRIs envisaging a total
investment of Rs 10,712 crore, he said.

He added that his Government was committed to provide time-bound
escort service through the promotional agencies for the speedy
implementation of the industrial and infrastructural projects.

The Chief Minister said that the State Government had recently formed
a committee of the State Cabinet on industry to provide expeditious
decisions on all matters relating to industrial promotion and
development.

The committee, in the past two meetings had reviewed a number of
on-going projects and taken steps to remove bottlenecks in their
execution, he added.

A high-power committee of Secretaries had also been formed in order to
facilitate and monitor industrial as well as infrastructural projects,
the Chief Minister said.

Calling for better research and development he pointed out that the
Centre had allowed about Rs 30 crore for this purpose. Industry houses
need to improve constantly their productivity and quality for survival,
he added.

Pointing out that West Bengal had achieved higher progress in terms of
the State Domestic Product than the national average in recent years,
Mr Basu said such growth in the past three years was the highest for
any comparable period in the past three decades.

Of the proposals received so far, there were 188 NRI/FDI projects with
an investment of Rs 10,712 crore. In the calendar year 1995, 387
approvals were received for a total investment of Rs 10,261 crore which
was 469 per cent more than the corresponding figure for 1994, Mr Basu
said.

The Chief Minister also said that between 1991-95, 214 industrial
units in the State had begun commercial production involving an
investment of Rs 6,728.34 crore.

At present there are 80 industrial projects under construction having
a total investment of Rs 2,240 crore, he added.

Mr Asim Dasgupta, Minister for Finance, West Bengal, said that the
State was aware of the requirement for infrastructure development.
Regarding the tardy progress of the mega-city project, he said the
State was not to blame.

He pointed out that State had contributed more than Rs 104 crore for
two years where it was supposed to give Rs 100 crore. On the other hand
the Centre had given only Rs 34 crore.

The State Government had allocated Rs 1,500 crore for power and road
development in the recent State Budget.

Reacting to the BNCCI's proposal on SSI units, Mr Dasgupta called for
a more "cost-efficient industrialization and employment generation".

He referred to the proposals in the State Budget by which 30,000 small
units would be set up all over the State.

Editorial comment: TRIUMPH OF PUERILITY

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

AS a duck, Bob Dole is looking more lame by the hour; if things
continue in this fashion, he will be a dead one in November. His
campaign is coming apart at the seams. The latest election ploy his
advisers have thought up in their desperation is to ask for the
President's medical records so that the American public is sure they
are not going to vote an HIV positive or a drug addict into the White
House. Have they collectively taken leave of their senses or are they
rehearsing kindergarten games? The idea seems to be to take some of the
attention away from Dole's advancing years and beat Clinton at the
fitness game: Dole is old but healthy, Clinton is young and degenerate.
Questioned about the 21-point lead his rival has established over him,
Dole takes out a letter written to him by his father after he was
wounded in action in the last World War as proof of his tenacity and
ability to survive. That was 50 years ago; today wars are nowhere as
bad for health as presidential campaigns. If this is the quality of the
advice Dole is getting from his campaign managers, he should sack the
lot. All the big ideas have faded into the background, all the small
ones, commensurate with the candidate's historical size, are appearing
from the closet. His campaign is beginning to smell of frustration,
meanness and mediocrity in other words, of failure.

On the other hand, nothing seems to do any lasting damage to Clinton.
The resignation of Morris and the revelations of the whore in question
did not create even a slight dip in his lead, he remains as strong as
ever. The latest survey shows that the incumbent's position is
unassailable: he leads in 33 States in double figures in about 25 of
them with 408 electoral college votes. That would amount to a
landslide. Clinton is surging ahead even in traditional Republican
pockets in the Mid-West, as well as in California and Florida. As a
bonus, Saddam Hussein became a media opportunity at the right time.
Nobody, of course, is talking about platforms, they hardly seem to
matter. It is a war of images, one ghoulish projection pitted against
the other. What is interesting about the campaign is what it portends
for the future. Under Clinton, the commercialization of politics has
made gigantic strides and very soon American Presidents will be
designed, packaged, advertised and sold like toothpaste. Dole, for all
his old-fashioned conservatism, is a willing partner in the game, for,
being the underdog by a long shot, he is even more dependent on
advisers than his rival. Let Americans sort them out as best as they
can. The world knows or perhaps, does not that the era of traditional
partisan politics is drawing to a close. New political realities will
emerge from the global underground whose advance guard is represented
by the likes of Ted Kaczynski,the suspected Unabomber, Iron Mike Tyson,
Shoko Asahara, fundamentalists, cultists and thugs of all descriptions,
Greens, Vegans and the whole jing-bang lot of loonies crawling just
beneath the surface, to bring down the techno-corporate elite.

Voluntary retirement scheme funds for Jute Corp. of India diverted to pay
salaries, wages

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

CALCUTTA, Sept. 16. The funds earmarked for running the voluntary
retirement scheme in the Jute Corporation of India has been diverted to
meet the normal establishment expenditure like salaries and wages of
JCI employees.

The diversion of VRS funds has also held up the Government's plan to
trim the workforce of JCI by 25 per cent through the VRS route.

Documents show that during the last three years JCI received a total
amount of Rs 2.70 crore from the Government towards VRS operation of
which Rs 1.80 crore have already been utilized by JCI for the purpose.

However, due to non-receipt of funds from the Government for providing
the salaries and wages of its employees, JCI resorted to diversion of
VRS funds to the tune of about Rs 1 crore to meet the expenses towards
payment of wages and salaries to its employees for August 1996.

The documents state that JCI had to take this step in order to check
any deterioration of the law and order situation arising out of
non-payment of wages and salaries to its employees.

Of the Rs 1 crore spent from the VRS fund, only Rs 10 lakhs have been
recovered. The Union Finance Ministry has also inquired with the Union
Textile Ministry on how much of VRS funds have been diverted by JCI to
meet its establishment expenditure.

In another extremely significant development, a part of an amount of
Rs 5 crore paid by National Jute Manufacturers Corporation to JCI
towards part settlement of its outstanding dues to the latter, Rs 1.15
crore has been utilized towards giving the salaries and wages of JCI
employees for August 1996.

This shows that the Government has not disbursed any sum to JCI for
payment of wages and salary of its employees.

Moreover, the Union Textile Ministry has directed the JCI management
to utilize the balance amount of Rs 5 crore towards carrying out the
minimum support price operation in case the price of raw jute falls
below the support price level.

The Ministry also made it clear to JCI that the balance amount (Rs
3.35 crore) should not be spent on clearing old arrears. It may be
pointed out that the Reserve Bank of India provides funds to JCI for
carrying out MSP operation.

Thus it is evident that JCI will not receive any fund from RBI for its
MSP operation and will be derived of its legitimate claim. It may be
pointed out that JCI could not undertake MSP operation for the last
three years due to shortage of funds.

NJMC has a total outstanding of Rs 69 crore to JCI of which it has
repaid only Rs 5 crore after much persuasion by the JCI management and
its employees' association. Moreover, the process of repayment has
started after five years.

The documents also show that between 1980-81 and 1994-95 JCI claimed
Rs 277.36 crore from the Government towards subsidy of which it has
received Rs 216.40 crore so far leaving a balance amount of Rs 60.95
crore.

However, the Government is yet to pay the amount to JCI. The
Government till date has also not agreed to provide guarantee to JCI
for obtaining bank loan to procure jute.

Secretary for Textiles holds talks on jute

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

CALCUTTA, Sept. 16. The Union Textiles Secretary, Mr Prabhat Kumar,
today met a delegation of the employees' association of the National
Textile Corporation, Jute Corporation of India and the Jute
Manufactures Development Council, in the city to discuss various issues
relating to these organizations.

The delegation was led by Mr Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, MLA.

The other members of the delegation included Mr D. K. Guha of JCI, Mr
Santosh Mazumdar of NTC and Mr S. K. Basu of the JMDC.

At the meeting Mr Guha urged the Textiles Secretary to provide a
Government guarantee for credit facilities for raw jute buying and
release of Government dues worth Rs 130 crores.

While the NTC representative, Mr Mazumdar asked Mr Kumar to waive
NTC's loan amounting to Rs 550 crores by the Government as has been
proposed by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, Mr
Basu of JMDC observed that the chairman of development and coordination
committee of JMDC be nominated from Calcutta for smooth functioning of
the organization.

Mr Kumar assured them that their respective problems will be looked
into.

Editorial comment: MON DIEU!

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

SUSSEX stealing a march over Champagne? "Unthinkable"impossible" cry
French connoisseurs in sheer agony. And yet a British "champagne" to
rival the classic grandes marques de France has been "created" in a
Sussex village using traditional French methods, says a report in the
Sunday Times of London. How did this sacrilege come about! Well, says
the report, a British couple spent a whole decade trying to perfect the
champagne process and propose to unveil their first bottle of bubbly,
Chardonnay Blanc de Blancs 1992 (how French can you get!), come next
month.

The French will have none of this effervescent nonsense. A British
vineyard emulating a real champagne? impossible, pronounced the French
way, or better still, "faut pas rigoler" (you must be joking!). But the
French are up against a scientific alibi. According to experts,
Europe's climate is shifting, bringing to the south of England the same
climatic conditions that Champagne enjoyed 50 years ago. So much so
that a wine expert who tasted the British brew described it as a tour
de force with a "steely elegance of the real thing". And to think that
the climate does it! So far the more effervescent variety the weather
has been complained of only by the English.

Tea Board eyeing U.S. market

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

By Bala Murali Krishna

NEW YORK, Sept. 16. The Tea Board of India, which has been eyeing the
rapidly growing demand for iced tea in the USA, is chalking out
strategies to enter the market in a big way.

The Tea Board chairman, Mr S.S. Ahuja, who recently completed a
promotional tour of the USA and Canada, said: "We are currently working
on a strategy to enter the sizable iced tea market in the U.S." The Tea
Board's director in New York, Mr S.K. Sinha, said the U.S. market was
growing rapidly and was maintaining a steady growth rate of more than
20 per cent.

Mr Ahuja said that the Board will be collaborating more closely with
the Tea Council of the USA, which it has rejoined as an observer
member. "We have realized the fruitfulness of the association with the
Tea Council," he said. Mr Ahuja said that the U.S. market had undergone
vast changes in the last decade, but India had positioned i brewing of
iced tea.

"Previously India lacked varieties of tea that were fast in colour, so
they were thought unsuitable for iced tea," he said. "But now we have
developed newer varieties of tea (Nilgiri) which are also suitably
priced." Mr Ahuja said the Tea Board was also considering re-joining
the Tea Council of the USA as a full-fledged member. "In the year since
we have been an observer member, we are extremely satisfied with the
efforts made by the Tea Council," he said.

"So we are definitely thinking of a comeback." The Tea Board
relinquished its membership of the Tea Council in 1991, and then
returned as an observer member last year. India is also working closely
with the Council's Specialty Tea Register (STAR), Mr Ahuja said.

"It is our primary market, and it has been our endeavour to satisfy
this market," he added.

He said the STAR was doing appreciable work in promoting specialty
teas, whose demand "is surging, especially in California where
specialty tea bars (like coffee houses) are gaining popularity."
During his visit, Mr Ahuja met Mr Joseph P. Simrany, president of the
Tea Council, and important buyers like Mr John D. Harney of Harney &
Sons.

He is also scheduled to visit Toronto, Hamburg in Germany and London.

Editorial comment: MORE COMPROMISES

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

WHY did Mr Jyoti Basu leave it to his Home (Police) Minister to
complain that the Gorkhaland issue had been unnecessarily revived by
the Prime Minister's announcement on Uttarakhand? After the virtual
revolt by the CPI(M)'s district committee in Darjeeling, the Chief
Minister is uncertain how to deal with Mr Subash Ghisingh. The hill
leader cannot be taken for granted at any time but the resolution
passed by 25 of the 29 CPI(M) district committees supporting the
Uttarakhand idea and, in effect, endorsing the old demand for
Gorkhaland poses a serious challenge. Mr Basu can hardly wish it away
as an "individual opinion" and proceed to impose Alimuddin Street's
will on the Darjeeling committee. Dissidence is a virtue CPI(M) units
have acquired from new-found allies. The crucial question is whether in
the new climate of revived hopes inspired by Mr Deve Gowda, and
endorsed by Mr V. P. Singh, the CPI(M)'s hill committee can remain
outside the mainstream of popular resurgence. Clearly, it cannot if it
has to protect its rapidly eroding base. Whatever little is left of
Marxist discipline or "democratic centralism" is in head-on collision
with the instinct for survival.

The policy of appeasement was meant not only to check separatist
ambitions but also to restore peace to the hills. The Darjeeling Gorkha
Hill Council looked capable of blending the concept of autonomy with
the fulfilment of local aspirations till extraneous ambitions came in
the way and development went by default. Even now it seems possible to
retrieve lost ground if the Central and State Governments can provide
the funds and the GNLF leader is persuaded to fix his priorities. The
Chief Minister makes every sense when he questions whether Nepalese in
the hills have any reason to look for "heavenly" gifts flowing from
Statehood compared to their compatriots in the plains. He might have
added that they have no reason either to continue to repose faith in
leaders who have used the ethnic platform for personal advantage. Now,
with the Prime Minister's announcement giving a fresh lease to
political tensions that had subsided in the last two years, Darjeeling
looks destined to have more splinter groups aspiring to power, more
leaders, more private battles, more militancy, all of which can do the
people no good. It is a pity that Mr Basu now finds his pragmatism
overshadowed by the need to win votes in Uttar Pradesh. He may be
banking on the somewhat nebulous future of the Uttarakhand proposal
itself. But, in the meantime, he will be obliged to deal with
adventurers and opportunists with the added prospect of fresh violence.
He can simply ask the Prime Minister, did he know what he was doing?

Sukh Ram held on arrival in Delhi

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

NEW DELHI, Sept. 16. The former Communication Minister, Mr Sukh Ram,
was arrested here tonight soon after he arrived from London at 11.40
p.m.

He was immediately taken into custody by the CBI, armed with
non-bailable arrest warrants issued by a Special CBI Court earlier in
the day.

The former Minister was taken to the All-India Institute of Medical
Sciences shortly after midnight after necessary formalities were
completed at the airport. He left in a white ambulance under heavy
escort through the gate next to the Air-India office and not by the
usual route. Mr Sukh Ram was accompanied by his wife, Mrs Rama Devi.

He was intercepted near the immigration counter and his passport
seized. His son, Mr Anil Sharma, a former Minister in the Himachal
Pradesh Government, was also present at the airport.

Scores of reporters and a battery of lensmen joined CBI officers and
the former Minister's family in their anxious wait for flight A.-I.
112, which landed shortly before midnight. The CBI team was accompanied
by doctors from the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and the AIIMS.

Earlier, the Special CBI judge, Mr Ajit Bharihoke, while issuing the
arrest warrants, said, there was "prima facie evidence of Mr Sukh Ram's
involvement in the case and his presence was necessary." The warrants
are returnable on October 1.

The CBI S.P., Mr H.S. Sandhu, in his application said that the former
Union Minister "appears to be deliberately evading the process of law
and was avoiding his arrest by remaining abroad." The agency said fax
messages had been sent to Mr Sukh Ram through the Indian High
Commission in London seeking his presence for the investigation.

The CBI said the accused camping in the residence of his son-in-law,
Dr S.L. Vasisht, in London, appears to be deliberately evading arrest
by remaining abroad.

The agency said Mr Sukh Ram as a public servant in conspiracy with the
Deputy Director (Finance) in the Department of Telecommunications, Ms
Runu Ghosh, misused his official position and caused pecuniary
advantage to Advance Radio Masts Ltd and a loss of about Rs 1.68 crore
to the Government.

The former Minister remained elusive for about a month since the CBI
recovered about Rs 4 crore and other valuables from his residences in
New Delhi and Mandi (Himachal Pradesh).

(Money meant for Cong: Earlier, the former Minister said at Heathrow
Airport before departure that the money seized from his houses belonged
to the Congress and was meant for electioneering in Uttar Pradesh.

"The money was given to me by an important party functionary," he
said, adds PTI.) Meanwhile, Delhi High Court today adjourned a petition
filed by Mr Sukh Ram challenging the jurisdiction of the Special CBI
judge to hear the anticipatory bail application.

The Special CBI judge had earlier dismissed a similar petition and had
posted the anticipatory bail application to September 19.

Pattalu Rao surrenders: Mr Pattalu Rama Rao, who heads ARM Ltd, today
surrendered before the Special CBI judge after the tenure of his
interim bail ended. Delhi High Court earlier this month had granted
interim bail to him for his daughter's marriage.

Maqbool Dar "obeys" Election Commission, returns to Delhi

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

NEW DELHI, Sept. 16. The Union Minister of State for Home, Mr Maqbool
Dar, today "complied" with the Election Commission's directive to
return to Delhi. He also promised not to return to Kashmir during the
counting of votes. The Commission had issued the directive on Saturday.

Mr Dar today called on the two Election Commissioners Mr M.S. Gill and
Mr G.V.G. Krishnamurthy.

Accompanied by a party General Secretary Mr Prabhat Samantray, Mr Dal
told the Election Commissioners that he had not misused official
machinery and security men for enhancing the prospects of his sons or
other party candidates.

No directive issued by E.C.: The Janata Dal claimed that no directive
had been issued by the Election Commission restricting Mr Dar from
campaigning in the next two phases of polls. It also said Mr Dar will
be leaving for a five-day campaign tour of the State tomorrow.

The party general secretary in a letter to the Commission, pointed out
that Mr Dar has been deputed by the party's central leadership to
supervise the poll campaign in the State. He also said during his tour
of the State, Mr Dar had "abstained from using Government machinery."
The Election Commissioners later said the poll panel was happy with the
Minister's "prompt response". "I am sure others in the Government will
not misuse authority during elections," Mr Krishnamurthy said. "We are
pleased to see that Mr Dar appreciated the stand taken by the
Commission," he added.

Mr Krishnamurthy said the poll panel was not only responsible for
ensuring free and fair elections but also to dispel any misgivings in
the mind of the people.

The Commission had reacted to the Kashmir Government's confirmation
that the Minister was in the State for the last ten days and his party
leaders had been canvassing in his official vehicle.

Following this, a communication was sent to the Home Secretary that
the Minister may be "well advised to come back to Delhi and not be
present during the day of polling and counting," Mr Krishnamurthy said.

During Mr Gill's recent visit to the Valley, political parties,
including the National Conference, had complained about the Mr Dar's
presence in his son's constituencies and the alleged misuse of official
machinery.

Cong denies allegation

from THE STATESMAN, September 16, 1996

NEW DELHI, Sept. 16. The Congress today claimed that it had never asked
Mr Sukh Ram to collect money on behalf of the party.

It denied that the money recovered from Mr Sukh Ram's residence during
a CBI raid belonged to the party.

The Congress spokesman, Mr V.N. Gadgil, said: "We have never
authorized any Minister to collect money for the party." He said the
AICC treasurer, Mr Sitaram Kesri, had already stated that the money
recovered by the CBI during raids did not belong to the Congress.

Asked to comment on the non-bailable warrant issued against the former
Communications Minister, Mr Gadgil said: "It is not a matter which
requires any comment from us. We have always said let the law take its
own course. And we will cooperate with investigating agencies." On Mr
Sukh Ram's statement that the CBI raids were part of a plot against the
party president, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, the spokesman said, "Only Mr
Sukh Ram can explain what he meant."
