<h4>CHAPTER ONE</h4>

<h3>A LOVIN' SPOONFUL</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<p> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the beginning, more exactly . . . in 1943,
Albert Hofmann, a Swiss bio-chemist working at the Sandoz
Pharmaceutical Laboratories in Basel, discovered &#151; by
accident, of course; one does not deliberately create such a
situation &#151; a new drug which had some very remarkable
effects on the human consciousness. The name of this drug was
d-Lysergic Acid Diethylamide Tartrate-25, a semi-synthetic
compound, the Iysergic acid portion of which is a natural product
of the ergot fungus <i>Claviceps purpurea</i>, which grows on rye
and other grains. Its most striking pharmacological
characteristic is its extreme potency &#151; it is effective at
doses of as little as ten-millionths of a gram, which makes it
5000 times more potent than mescaline. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was during the synthesis of d-LSD-25 that chance
intervened when Dr. Hofmann inhaled some of the whitish-brown
powder and discovered that it produced some strange effects on
his mind. . . . 'Objects, as well as the shape of my associates
in the laboratory, appeared to undergo optical change . . .
fantastic pictures of extraordinary plasticity and intensive
colour seemed to surge towards me.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> </p>

<h4>1960</h4>
<i>

<p>New York City</i>, seventeen years later . . . a small package
from Switzerland arrived in my mail one morning containing one
gram of Dr. Hofmann's acid, which I had arranged to be sent to
me. There was also a bill for $285. I had first heard of LSD from
Aldous Huxley, when I had telephoned him at his home in Los
Angeles to inquire about obtaining some mescaline, which he had
recently been using. His information also included the name of
Dr. Albert Hofmann and a caution, subsequently unheeded, to take
great care if ever I should take any of the stuff: 'It is much
more potent than mescaline, though Gerald (Heard) and I have used
it with some quite astonishing results really.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There had been no difficulty obtaining even one
gram of LSD &#151; I simply asked an English doctor friend of
mine to write the order on a sheet of New York hospital
letterhead saying that I needed this ergot-derivative as a
'control' drug for a series of bone-marrow experiments. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eagerly I unwrapped the package. The acid was in a
small dark jar marked 'Lot Number H-00047', and in appearance
looked a bit like malted milk powder. My problem was how to
convert the loose powder into a more manageable form. One gram
would make 5000 individual doses and I was obviously going to
need to measure it out in some way. I decided to randomise it by
mixing it into a stiff paste made from icing sugar. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I cleared the kitchen table and set to work. First
I poured some distilled water into a bowl, and then mixed in the
LSD. When all the acid had dissolved I added confectioner's sugar
until the mixture was a thick paste. I then transferred my
'divine confection', spoon by laborious spoon, into a
sixteen-ounce mayonnaise jar, and, by what magical alchemic
process, the stuff measured exactly 5000 spoonfuls ! In other
words, one teaspoon of the stuff ought to contain 200 gamma
(millionths of a gram), which would be sufficient for an eight-
to ten-hour session, and a pretty intense one at that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I should add at this point that I had, like all
good chefs, been tasting the preparation during its making with
my finger, and must have absorbed about the equivalent of five
heavy doses before I finally screwed the lid on the mayonnaise
jar, which left me somewhat unprepared for what was to follow. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I rented at that time the floor-through apartment
above Jim Paul Eiler's 'Showplace' on West Fourth Street near the
corner of Macdougal and Washington Square. It was a large
rambling place -with a roof garden over the back from which to
observe the life of the Village and the concrete towers of
Manhattan. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I moved on to the roof and sat up there and began
to observe . . . <i>I beheld a city of 10,000 angry streets, and
giant buildings fingered the sky; from a thousand throats the
giant screams. A hundred trash-cans tumble lids and litters
across the sidewalks, a siren goes hooting past, and all is
CHAOS. My mind was in a state of confusion, of whirling
distractions and distortions and intensely vivid non sequiturs.
'I have broken the shell!' I laughed. 'Now I step forth easily
from my body's prison-cell and live in the realm of the
primordial. I shall sing of heroes, wild men of the mountains,
guardians of the door, and ancient legends.... I shall transform
myself into a god who could walk across the tops of mountains . .
. thousand-headed was Purusa, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed he
reached beyond the earth! . . . Cuhulain rides his five fiery
chariots across the firmament! Arthur and Lancelot in battle! The
ground shakes! In the beginning was blood and fire.... I shall
sing that you might listen and would know the glory that mall is,
now, in his first dawning.... In the beginning, then ... proudly
the purple cock-man proclaims the arrival of the Dawn. The Warden
of Robes enters to attend our abracadabra about Acid and All
accompanied by large assembly of Acid Age Adams, Artists,
Anarchists, Actors, Angels, Alchemists, Athletes, Aristocrats and
assorted Acrobats. The 'gates of heaven' swing open on the court
within; worshipping priests from 10,000 countries kneel before
the royal insignia. The first rays of the sun gild the 'fairy
palms'; smoke of incense swirls round dragons writhing on each
royal robe&#151;they seem to float among the clouds.</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> It was a very strange first trip indeed, and it was of many
hours' duration, perhaps fifteen. What I had experienced was the
equivalent of death's abolition of the body. I had literally
'stepped forth' out of the shell of my body, into some other
strange land of unlikeliness, which can only be grasped in terms
of astonishment and mystery, as an <i>état de l'absurde</i>,
ecstatic nirvana. I could now 'understand' why death could
produce the sort of confusionIwas experiencing. In life we are
anchored through the body to such inescapable cosmic facts as
space, gravity, electromagnetic vibrations and so forth. But when
the body is lost, the psychic factor which survives is free to
behave with uninhibited extravagance. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was only after many, many acid sessions that I
learned how to cope satisfactorily with the incessant barrage of
sense-eclipsing distractions, pleasant and unpleasant, delightful
and horrible, which acid induces. I discovered, for instance,
that I could, by concentrating my attention on some object, put a
stop to the whirling distractions. The object on which I
concentrated became a radiance of pure light, very wonderful
&#151; so wonderful that one could be wholly absorbed in it. It
would be possible to stop at this point, to convince oneself that
this was the Real Thing, the ultimate illumination, Nirvana! Or
the 'Divine White Light'! But &#151; let's face it &#151; LSD is
not the key to a new metaphysics of being or a politics of
ecstasy. The 'pure light' of an acid session is not this &#151;
it may even be the apotheosis of distractions, the ultimate and
most dangerous temptation. But it does allow one to live at least
for a time in the light of the knowledge that every moment of
time is a window into eternity, that the absolute is manifest in
every appearance and relationship, and that Love is Wisdom in
daily practice. And though hard, it is possible to live this way.
It is the development of another state of consciousness within
'one's' own self, one that leads to a vision of existence in
which only the sense of wonder remains and all fear is gone. It
is also the impetus that makes a few travellers in each
generation set off in search of the grail, the genii in the
bottle, the magic ring.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> Once back in the present, when the 'mountains were again the
mountains, and the lakes again the lakes' I felt a degree of
apprehension about the acid I had by now stashed away in my
study. It was pretty volatile stuff. How on earth could the
energy of this strange atom be utilised; how could man adapt it
to his needs? LSD was a bundle of solutions looking for a
problem, the problem being how to undertake a work of integration
on a massive scale. Modern man had fallen victim to the merciless
vision of his own sceptical intelligence. Caught up in a
wilderness of externals, he was a stranger to himself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, I telephoned Aldous Huxley at his
home; he might at least advise me about what was happening with
regard to LSD. Huxley had used both mescaline and LSD and had
found in them, perhaps, the visions he had so long sought. On the
phone, he was very sympathetic. No, there was still no one in a
position to say what was happening in relation to visionary
experience via LSD, though it seemed to excite a great curiosity
in the minds of many he had discussed it with. Of course, there
was a lot of work to be done; unconsciously, if not always
consciously, everyone knows that this Other World is there,
inside the skull &#151; and any news about it, any discussion of
its significance, its relevance to other aspects of life, is a
matter of universal concern. Perhaps 'mindchangers' should be
used in the context of some kind of yoga of total awareness,
leading to enlightenment within the world of everyday experience
&#151; which of course under acid becomes the world of miracle
and beauty and sublime mystery when the experience is what it
always ought to be. This could not be achieved by acid alone but
is achieved, essentially, through constant awareness &#151;
conscious even of the unconscious, by means of the ordinary
processes of living. Perhaps acid is above all a therapy for the
wide spread sickness of insensitiveness and ignorance which
psychologists call Normality' or 'mental health'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Huxley called me back a few days later, having
thought over my problem, and suggested that I go to Harvard to
meet a Dr. Timothy Leary, a professor there, whom he'd met
earlier that year in Copenhagen, when he had presented a paper on
induced visionary experience before the Fourteenth International
Congress of Applied Psychology. Leary had also read a paper on
'How to Change Behaviour' describing the induction of visionary
mental states by psilocybin, the synthetic of the sacred mushroom
of Mexico. He spoke very warmly of Leary as a scientist but also
as a man, whom he described as 'a splendid fellow'. Leary had
also written three classic monographs on personality and
psychotherapy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'If there is any one single investigator in America
worth seeing,' Huxley assured me, 'it is Dr. Leary.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> </p>

<h4>1961</h4>

<p>There had been quite a bit of free-floating acid around
Greenwich Village that winter, but mostly restricted to the
'beats' of the East Village and a few wealthy Manhattan cats to
whom they sold it. It was legal, of course, in those days, and
this considerably reduced the paranoia level. 'Taking acid' had
not yet become the popular pastime of a turned-on youth, for such
didn't exist. The world of the late fifties and early sixties was
unimaginably drab and dreary. It was still a tight little
conformist world of roles and rules and rituals. Our culture had
drowned itself in a sea of contradictory and conflicting voices.
And, politically, Dulles &amp; Co. had tied the coldwar noose
around all our throats. We had finally conned ourselves into
submission to some nameless fear. Western civilisation lived
under the paranoia of the mushroom cloud. Liberal and religious
values had eroded to the point of insignificance.
Twentieth-century mass-society showed the political inhumanity
inherent in technological life-worlds. And it was perhaps
inevitable that some of us took to acid (and later to myths and
ancient stories) to seek a formula that would turn the
surrounding world to dust and reveal the portals of paradise. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But I think that for perhaps the majority of the
avant-garde. in this very early period, LSD was still something
of an 'exotic' whose effects could not be taken for granted. LSD
involved risk. It was anarchistic; it upset our apple-carts,
torpedoed our cherished illusions, sabotaged our beliefs. It was
something you had to guard against, or you might explode. It was
a difficult experience to assimilate. It was impossible to
integrate with the ordinary world. And so on and so forth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Turning on' had not yet become a natural part of
our existence, or a symbol of certain life-styles, or philosophy,
or religion, or personal liberation. Yet there were some, of my
circle, who, with Rimbaud, could say, 'I dreamed of crusades,
senseless voyages of discovery, republics without a history,
moral revolution, displacement of races and continents: I
believed in all the magics.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And our Crusade was to launch LSD on the world!
Whilst other artists/visionaries/seers had been content to
observe the world, the New Message was simple: if things are not
right, then change them! We would make the dynamic life-giving
adventure of exploring Inner Space the New Romance! We would set
off an explosion that would sweep through our culture and give
birth to a New Radicalism! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We would even found a drug-based religion, whose
message would be 'Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out'! We would proclaim
the Reign of the Happily Integrated Modern Soul ! We would become
the first signatories of a new 'Declaration of Evolution' as
published in Timothy Leary's <i>The Polities of Ecstasy</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After my first few acid sessions, I began to
undergo some kind of metamorphosis. None of the successive issues
in my life were plain, nothing was concrete; I was now that
helpless drifting man, cut off from his roots, with no
destination told. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The reality on which I had consciously tried to
build my personality had dissolved into Maya, the hallucinatory
facade. Stripped of one kind of reality, and unwilling or unable
to benefit from the possibilities of another one, I was acutely
aware of my helplessness, my utter transience between two worlds,
one inside and the other wholly within. It set up a dichotomy,
and I was at the mercy of two contradictory yet seemingly
inseparable attitudes. There was, on the one hand, still the
familiar world of ordinary appearances, which I could cope with
without ever needing to find any meaning for, and then there was
this 'Other World' whose existence alone seemed to disclose the
nature of reality as it concerned me personally. In the former I
was a stranger to myself, a puppet of rote-consciousness, a
cipher on the face of existence, an object furnished with a label
and a price-tag, numbed and numbered by a neutral time that is
neither duration nor eternity. In the latterIwas not a dot but a
species in the great evolutionary experiment, a conscious agent
in the cosmic processes called life; it provided me with some
'meaning' for solitary existence, beyond the falsifications of
the mind, where I hoped I could achieve a simple awareness and
even affirmation of the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was faced with the necessity to prepare a set of
'spiritual coordinates'; a set of natural harmonious rules to
follow as I spun off into neurological space, and more effective
instruments of symbolisation in order to leave this swampland in
which I moved. I was lost and exhausted, ambushed by stagnation
and depression. Yet it was the energy created out of this
tension, verging on strain, that kept me going in New York for a
few more months. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was working in New York at that time as the
executive secretary of the Institute for British American
Cultural Exchange. This grandiose title meant that I was in the
service of a semi-official British propaganda agency in the field
of international cultural relations. There was an impressive
board of directors, which included Lord and Lady Natalie
Douglas-Hamilton, Huntington Hartford (the megamillionaire whom
Tom Wolfe has described as someone who had come amongst us in the
role of a 'Martin Luther for modern culture'), Lionel Trilling,
W. H. Auden, Congressman Seymour Halpern, General Frank Howley,
the Vice-President of New York University, Buell Gallagher,
President of City College, New York. <br>

<p> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My offices were in the Huntington Hartford building
in the East Fifties, which cost a million dollars to convert into
Nassau Paladian and housed, in addition to the Institute
Speedparks Inc., The American Handwriting Institute, <i>Show</i>
magazine, and downstairs, a private art gallery. It was a neat
little set-up, and I felt rather pleased that we had got it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of my time was spent selecting scholarship
candidates for a Junior Year programme at St. Andrews University
(Lord Douglas-Hamilton's brother, The Duke of Hamilton, was
Chancellor); and for short-term credit courses at Oxford and
Cambridge; some of my time was spent meeting and talking with
executives of the large Foundations like the Carnegie and the
Rockefeller Institute, to try to get more money for our
programmes. But most of the time I spent smoking grass; and,
towards the end, getting stoned on acid. And, as the summer of
1961 approached, it became increasingly clear that I should have
to resign. The programmes had got all their dates mixed up, and
nothing about accommodation had been firmed up; the files were in
a mess, and piles of unanswered correspondence littered my desk;
bills accumulated and income was reduced to almost nil. My hours
became erratic. I very seldom bothered to answer the phone. When
people came to see meIwould always be stoned and doubtless
altogether incoherent. I attacked the Queen. I spoke
disparagingly of British culture. I spoke of 'kingdoms yet to
come' with a sort of women's magazine glibness. And I kept having
visions of this 'Golden Dawning' of consciousness in man which
would enable us to get things whole, to see life's magic
miracles, to know that indeed all is in everything from blade of
grass to man and woman. It was a vision of some ideal existence
in which there was only the sense of wonder, and all fear gone;
of a certain state of being that was there not to be judged, but
simply to be. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> </p>

<h4>September 1961</h4>
<i>

<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts</i> . . . The New England Fall was
just beginning, and the leaves on the trees were changing colour;
the air was fresh and clear, like Vichy water, and Cambridge
seemed an altogether nice place to be. I didn't know anybody, so
I rented a couple of rooms in a house on Brattle Street, and
moved in. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My object in coming to Cambridge was to meet Dr.
Leary to discuss LSD, or more exactly, to seek his advice about
what I should do with the some 4975 trips I had left in the
mayonnaise jar. The next day I telephoned him at his office on
Divinity Avenue and arranged to meet him over lunch at the
Faculty Club. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; On the telephone Leary was very much the cautious
professional and I was a bit apprehensive.... Leary, the author
of <i>Interpersonal Diagnostic of Personality</i>; Leary, the
no-nonsense behaviourist; Leary, the number one American expert
in personality testing. And yet, according to Huxley, this was
the man who was doing important new research in the non-clinical
uses of the Sacred Mexican Mushroom. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At twelve o'clockIwalked along Mount Auburn Street,
flanked on one side by white colonial houses with pretty gardens,
and on the other by the river Charles. A university boat crew
lazed by the boathouse. On the banks tidy groups of students sat
rapping or reading. Across the river, sharply outlined in the
bright sunlight, I saw the Georgian features of the Harvard
Business School, and the busy Boston Freeway reminded me of
Robert Lowell's lines: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Everywhere <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; giant finned cars nose forward like fish; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; a savage servility <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; slides by on grease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon I was in Harvard Square, and it was not long
before I reached the Faculty Club, an impressive building just
across from the Library. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had arranged to meet Leary inside the main lobby,
near the cloakroom. But the place was jammed with intense,
garrulous, smooth-suited, young men, and, since I had no idea
what Leary looked like, I asked a porter at the reception desk
whether the professor had arrived. He pointed to a handsome,
clean-cut man in his late thirties wearing a Harris-tweed jacket
and grey flannels. He also had on a pair of torn sneakers and one
red-socked toe peeped out from one largish hole. He had the
conventional Harvard short-back-and-sides and a hearing-aid
visible on one exposed ear. He was reading the sports section of
the <i>Boston Globe</i>. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Dr. Leary? How nice to meet you. I'm Michael
Hollingshead.' We shook hands, and he smiled broadly and beckoned
me to the dining-room door, seating us at a small table by the
wall, where we could talk without being disturbed. I asked him to
order for both of us. We small-talked during the meal. Leary
seemed a bit distracted with other thoughts, and sometimes would
fiddle with his hearing-aid, as though blaming the instrument for
his inability to catch what I was saying. So I said nothing, and
encouraged him to talk. He was a very funny raconteur and told
stories about his life in Berkeley and his family and his
sabbatical in Florence. It wasn't until the coffee came that he
got on to the subject of psychedelics. He began telling me about
his work with psilocybin, the mushroom drug. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed that the University had let him set up
something he called the Harvard Psychedelic Research Project for
the study of these drugs and to test their potential as aids to
facilitate behaviour change. He felt they had great potential use
in such areas as alcoholism, recidivism, even in juvenile
delinquency. He then elaborated his theory of the game-structure
of Western society; how we all play games, for which there are
definite roles, rules, and rituals. Sick or mentally deranged
persons were 'game-losers'. If the game was, say, football, then
a neurotic person would turn up wearing cricket gear and insist
that everyone play his game. Efficient game players were those
who could make definitions and from them decisions which
corresponded to the consensus reality. He told me that the
psilocybin experience helped people get out of all games, move
into a space he called 'non-game', from which Olympian height the
subject could see his own hang-ups. And it was this insight, he
felt, that would provide them with the necessary impetus to
change. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I said that I'd never taken psilocybin, but it
interested me and I'd like to try it, if that could be arranged.
I then told him a bit about my first acid experience, and how I
had been taking it on average about once a week since then, and
was now more baffled than when I started using it. I felt LSD was
probably more confusing than illuminating. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary said there was still a lot of work to be done
in the field. He had not himself yet taken LSD, but he imagined
its effects on the mind to be similar to those he had experienced
under psilocybin. The main problem was one of communication: how
to verbalise an essentially non-verbal experience in such a way
as to make sense to people living in the ordinary game-reality
who anyway thought of these drugs as mysterious rather than
mystical. Here we were talking of temporary alterations of the
human consciousness brought about by these extraordinary
substances &#151; which cause a by-passing of automatic
programming in human speech and action, making possible direct
awareness at higher-than-normal levels of intensity and in
other-than-utilitarian worlds of experience. These drugs, if
properly used, could be the source of energy that is to transform
the human mind. But for the majority of his behaviourist
colleagues, these drugs were a threat to their game. They tend to
hide their mediocrity behind 'scientific' models and mechanical
designs of the human organism which are by definition mediocre,
generating triviality and error. As a consequence, they veer
easily into paranoid fantasies about the subjective nature of the
psychedelic experience, probably thinking anyone using these
drugs is pretty crazy anyhow. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nevertheless, the situation at Harvard was pro the
Behaviourists &#151; B. F. Skinner, the American Pavlov, was
getting massive appropriations from the Federal Government for
programmed teaching machines and research into conditioned and
re-conditioned human behaviour, and for whom the term 'mind' was
about as meaningless as the word 'snow' to someone living in the
middle of Africa. Mind, if it existed, was an aberration of the
computer's 'mind'; man was a conditioned animal, imprinted from
birth for life in ordered, concrete society. His brain was a
problem-solving mechanism, either efficient or inefficient.
Skinner and his boys were engaged in nothing less than a massive
programme of human conditioning, starting at primary school
level. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Skinner's philosophy stood in direct contrast to
Leary's. Rather than thinking of mind in man as some kind of
spanner in the works, the psychedelic-user is more likely to see
it as a truly miraculous instrument for new perceptions and
insights about those aspects of reality which concern him
personally. He may feel awed by the sudden power it releases
during a session and realise that his mind is his greatest
endowment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary had little time for those scientists who
extended the machine paradigm to living organisms. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Qualitative change is needed in the pattern of
    mind-research if we are to discern an enlarged meaning of
    nature and of man extending beyond mathematical and
    experimental analysis of sensory phenomena and human
    behaviour. The new direction of research has been to hasten
    the technicalisation of human nature and ignore as a
    superstition all work on those aspects of human nature which
    do not conform with the orthodoxy of the body-machine
    concept. We must move beyond this sort of scientific tyranny
    of behaviouristic and mechanistic procedures, where man is
    understood in terms of controls or biological-drive
    mechanisms. This is carrying Descartes too far. A psychedelic
    user cannot reduce the mind-brain problem to a materialistic
    monism. He is more likely to see how the current
    over-emphasis on mechanism has produced a corresponding
    dislocation of vision, one that is resulting in a
    de-humanisation of man. He is more likely to turn into a
    revolutionary than a college professor.' </p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; It was getting late. Leary had a class at three
o'clock. I wondered how best to approach the fact that I had some
LSD with me. I decided to leave the matter for another day. We
shook hands and I said I'd call him again in a few days' time,
for another meeting. Fine. Perfect. We parted feeling it had been
a good lunch. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A couple of days passed, one of them tripping
around the museums and the banks of the Charles. The students
seemed strangely distant, and, in an odd sort of way,
English-looking, probably as a result of wearing tweedy clothes
and baggy grey trousers. Perhaps these are the robots Skinner has
conditioned, I thought, their minds sanctioned by scientific
objective reality as information-storing, predicting and
computing mechanisms, a 'tool' with which to shape a better
life-style in the great American dream. They seemed unaware that
there exists a range of energies and awarenesses beyond
rote-consciousness or the imprinted symbols of rational thought
which can work with a rapidity and efficiency beyond the workaday
conceptual processes. For every moment of human life is affected
by the way man's mind works. Everything we see, touch, think and
feel is linked with it, so that when the mind is extended for
brief moments, as it is under acid, these elements can be used
more freely and creatively, and can therefore be a tremendously
important influence in a person's life.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My need to communicate this was very great indeed.
But the few people I did talk to about LSD seemed blithely
indifferent, or even a little shocked. I felt like some sleazy
drug operator in Marseilles, trying to hook young kids on heroin.
I began to get depressed, feeling that I'd got life cocked or
somehow incomplete after fooling about with all this acid. By the
end of my third day in Cambridge, I was feeling suicidal. A
communication problem, Leary had said. Okay, then, I'd try to
communicate with him, perhaps he would be able to emphathise with
my plight. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I got him at the office the next day. I had already
mailed him a short note the night before alerting him to my
inability to cope with my life-situation due to the disruptive
influence of acid. And when he got on the phone he spoke calmly
and authoritatively about how we must all share our knowledge
about these drugs, and how I had a lot to contribute, and that a
George Litwin would drive round to pick me up at my digs and
bring me back to the office. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; George turned up some ten minutes after putting the
receiver down. He was a genial and open Leo with lots of energy
forever rising. On the way to the office, he told me that he was
a graduate student in psychology, and Leary was his thesis
adviser. He'd taken psilocybin a few times, and had even taken
mescaline at the University of Chicago where he went to school.
Now he was a behaviourist who believed in psychedelic drugs,
which he felt was a bit heretical of him to say the least. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Soon we pulled up outside a pretty colonial style
house marked 'Social Relations Department: Center for Research in
Personality', which I later discovered was the same building in
which William James had done his researches with nitrous oxide
(laughing gas) until he was told to stop. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; George lead me along a corridor to Leary's office.
Leary was seated behind a desk dictating something to his Chinese
secretary, who kept giggling every time someone came through the
door. A few young men sat on a sofa quietly reading from piles of
mimeographed papers. One wall was entirely covered with a huge
blackboard on which the day's timetable was noted. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary waved me to a chair next to the desk,
finished whatever he was dictating, and screwed in the ear-aid in
an obvious attempt to let me know he was listening with all ears.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I repeated some of my thoughts explaining how my
personal philosophy had changed since LSD. I needed a place where
I could simply be, without always having to justify what I was
into. I also explained that I was broke and needed a place to
crash. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He invited me to move in to his house in the Newton
Center suburb of Boston. He said that I could use the attic,
which was large and spacious, where I would not be disturbed. He
gave me a $20 bill and asked George to take me over there. Once I
was more settled, I could join his team working with psilocybin.
Would I like to teach a course one hour a week to a class of
graduate students &#151; a course in existential philosophy,
concentrating on the phenomenological aspects of heightened
states of consciousness ? Would I like to borrow his Volkswagen
to drive to New York and pick up the rest of my things? Would
dinner at eight suit me? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He could not have been more helpful. I began to
realise what Huxley had meant when he called Leary 'a splendid
fellow'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Apart from Tim and myself, the only other people
living in the house were his two children, Jackie and Susan.
There were the occasional girl-friends, and visitors up for the
weekend from New York. But usually the house was quiet and its
life simple. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was a big house with a beautiful garden and
sited next to the Little League Baseball ground, where Tim,
Jackie and myself would often join one of the evening games with
the local kids. The rest of the evening might be spent in telling
each other amusing stories, discussing the implications of
psychedelics, baseball or travel. Tim was also a great fan of D.
H. Lawrence, and we would chat about Lawrence's life and his
'message'. Every now and then I'd bring up the matter of the
mayonnaise jar, but Tim didn't seem particularly interested in
trying LSD, probably because he didn't want to get other issues
in the way of his on-going (and officially sanctioned) 'mushroom
research', as it was referred to in those days. His view might be
summarised as saying: When you've had one psychedelic, you've had
them all. But he did give me some psilocybin to try, which came
in the form of tiny red pills from Sandoz. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I dropped three of these pills, which was
considered about optimal dosage, for my first trip. I was alone
in the house. And I felt good about taking a session, especially
as I was very curious to see how the experience would compare
with acid. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The effect was excellent, though not as powerful as
LSD. It contained lots of magic and induced all kinds of very
pleasant visual changes, with colours deepening, turning the
house and garden into a Persian miniature of exquisite beauty and
prettiness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was a little disappointed when, after four hours,
the landscape changed back into twentieth-century American
reality. But I enjoyed it and used to take it pretty regularly
after that. Perhaps after all, LSD was too powerful for our
fragile nervous systems to bear? Besides, the effects of
psilocybin were of only four hours' duration, compared to
anything up to twelve hours on high-dosage acid. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p> I had been living at Tim's for about a couple of weeks when
Maynard Fergusson, the Canadian trumpet player, arrived with his
wife, Flo. They were old close friends of Tim, and to us seemed
the ultimate manifestations of the current New York 'in' crowd
they were witty, urbane, hip, and cool in all areas. They also
enjoyed smoking pot. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was in those days no popular voice speaking
for marijuana, although it was considered by the 'in' crowd to be
the last word in status symbols. It was also illegal, a fact that
made Tim feel a bit paranoid about people smoking it in his
house. He did not use it himself. He took nothing stronger than a
few micrograms of psilocybin. And of course wine and whisky,
which he believed were 'indispensable luxuries'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One evening the subject turned to LSD. They
discussed acid in terms of a fluent flow of neologisms, jazz
slang, and weird verbal formulations. They treated the subject
lightly, as they also would marijuana and getting stoned in
general. And it became apparent to me that they had never
actually tried it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Later, when they heard that I had some, they
suggested that we all have an acid session together, including
Tim. Tim excused himself, saying he had some papers to mark. But
said we were welcome to take it if we wished. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I brought down the mayonnaise jar and gave Maynard
and Flo a teaspoonful of the confection. I also took one myself.
We then settled comfortably around the blazing log fire, lit some
candles and incense, and prepared for take-off. Tim had been
fussing about in the room while all this had been going on,
trying not to let his curiosity take him away from whatever other
business he was engaged in. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; After about thirty minutes, Flo, who until that
moment had been lying fully reclined on the sofa, sat up,
suddenly, her face one huge smile, and started waving her arms at
Tim. 'You gotta try this, Tim, baby. It's f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c!' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Yeah, really, Tim,' confirmed Maynard, his face
glowing like an electric toaster. 'It really gets you there
&#151; wow &#151; it's really happening, man.... ' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps Tim was impressed by the evidence of his
two friends, who were after all pretty hip and experienced in
using drugs. Perhaps he saw that we were all having a great time,
and he wanted in. Whatever it was, something finally decided him
and he took a spoon of the acid. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What happened to him next was the subject of a
chapter in his book, <i>High Priest</i>, which he published
several years later. As Tim described it in his book: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'It has been five years since that first LSD trip with
    Michael Hollingshead. I have never forgotten it. Nor has it
    been possible for me to return to the life I had been leading
    before the session. I have never recovered from the
    shattering ontological confrontation. I have never been able
    to take myself, my mind, and the social world around me
    seriously. Since that time five years ago I have been acutely
    aware of the fact that I perceive everything within the
    around me as a creation of my own consciousness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; From that day . . . I have never lost the
    realisation that I am an actor and that everything around me
    is a stage prop and setting for the comic drama I am creating
    . . . LSD can be a profoundly asocial experience. Since that
    first trip with Michael I was never able to commit myself to
    the game of proselytising for LSD itself. Nothing that
    doesn't ring true to my ancient cell wisdom and to that
    central vibrating beam within can hold my attention for very
    long. From the date of this session it was inevitable that we
    would leave Harvard, that we would leave American society and
    that we would spend the rest of our lives as mutants,
    faithfully following the instructions of our internal
    blueprints and tenderly, gently disregarding the parochial
    social inanities.' </p>
