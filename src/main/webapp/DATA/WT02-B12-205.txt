</A></H2>


<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Some 22,000 Hispanic farm workers are

employed from mid-March through late-October harvesting potatoes,

sugar beets and grain in Idaho, and 15,000 have below-poverty

line incomes, according to an August 25 newspaper analysis. Hispanics

are believed to be 75 percent of Idaho farm workers, and one-fourth

of the state's farm workers are believed to be unauthorized.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The percentage of farm workers who are

migrants--meaning that they stay away from their usual homes overnight

to do farm work--is reportedly declining in Idaho as migrants

&quot;settle out.&quot; There are an estimated 22,000 Hispanic

farm workers in Idaho, and they do 73 percent of the work done

by hired workers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">About 25 percent of Idaho's farm workers

are believed to be illegal aliens.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Most Idaho farm workers average 35 work

weeks, making $7,000 or between $4 and $6 an hour. There is no

state minimum wage for farm workers, and only workers employed

on farms that hire 500 or more man days<B> </B>of labor must provide

Unemployment Insurance--in 1995, 2,646 of the estimated 30,000

seasonal farm workers in Idaho filed for unemployment insurance

there (some Idaho farm workers may have filed for UI in Texas

or California).</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The Latino population in Washington grew

by 45 percent between 1990 and 1995 to more than 300,000.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">There are no union contracts on Arizona

farms. However, in 1984, there was hope that Lupe Sanchez, founder

of the Arizona Farm Workers Union, would organize Arizona farm

workers as Cesar Chavez had organized California farm workers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Sanchez was featured on the cover of

the Denver Post's weekly magazine in 1984 as the hero who helped

some 300 illegal alien farm workers near Phoenix to negotiate

an agreement with the successor of the citrus farm Goldmar in

1979. Under the agreement, $0.20 for each hour worked went into

a Farmworker Economic Development Corporation fund that aimed

to create jobs in Guanajuato, and other central Mexican states,

where most of the migrants came from.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">The grower who negotiated with the AFWU,

Art Martori, said that he had decided to use H-2 workers, which

required him to build housing for farm workers.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT FACE="Courier">Sanchez was praised for drawing a salary

of only $3,600 per year, plus expenses, and for attracting $100,000

of Martori's money for investment in Mexico, plus another $1.5

million from US foundations and churches.</FONT></TT>
