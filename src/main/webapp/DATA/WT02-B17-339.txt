<P><H4>Madidi National Park.
 </H4>
<P>
Since a RAP expedition identified the area's biodiversity in
1990, CI has been working with the Bolivian government to make
Madidi a legally protected area.  In Madidi National Park, Bolivia
adds a significant new link in a chain of protected areas that
includes Pilon Lajas Biosphere Reserve, the Chimane Forest, and
the Beni Biosphere Reserve.  In 1995, Bolivian President Gonzalo
Sanches de Lozada, recognizing the country's important biological
heritage, also created the 3.2 Chaco National Park.

CI is working
with the leaders of both Bolivia and Peru to extend this chain
of protected areas by establishing Peru's Tambopata Candamo Reserved
Zone, which lies directly across the border from Madidi National
Park, as an officially designated protected area.  Should Tambopata
attain protected status, this &quot;string of pearls&quot; would
achieve international stature as one of the world's most biologically
important areas.

<H4>The Chalalan Project. </H4>

<P>
With the support of the
Inter-American Development Bank,  CI is working sustainable development
initiatives with the Tacana-Quechua Indian people of San Jose
de Uchupiamonas near Madidi National Park.  In particular, CI
is focusing on ecotourism as a village enterprise.   The ecotourism
facility near Lake Chalalan will allow visitors to experience
intact rain forest, and enable the people of San Jose to benefit
from careful stewardship of their lands.   

<P>
<H4>The Beni Biosphere
Reserve and Chimane Indigenous Territory  
</H4>
<P>CI continues to work
with Chimane indigenous communities in the Beni Biosphere reserve
and Pilon Lajas, exploring the viability of rain forest products
and supporting community development initiatives.  

<P>
<H4>The Bolfor
Project </H4>

<P>In 1995, a Conservation Policy study based on the BOLFOR
Project in the Chimane Forest raised questions about the benefits
of sustainable forest management.  Research showed that current
&quot;unsustainable,&quot; though highly selective logging methods
were found to be nearly five times more profitable than sustainable
logging, while causing up to two-thirds less damage.</BLOCKQUOTE>
