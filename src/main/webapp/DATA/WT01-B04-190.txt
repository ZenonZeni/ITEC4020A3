<A NAME = "Organizing and Managing"><h3>Organizing and Managing Diversity in Instruction</h3></A>
<P>
<br>
<p>Teachers in VE classes frequently comment that the biggest problem they
encounter in the class is managing the diversity of instructional needs of
their students.  Consideration must be given to the characteristics and needs
of the students, the scheduling of students during the day, the way students
are grouped for instruction, and  the management of  the learning environment.
This section provides a variety of suggestions that may help the VE teacher.

<A NAME = "Characteristics of Exceptional">Characteristics of Exceptional</A> Students</h3>
<P>
<br>
<p>As identified in the first section of this document, all categories of
exceptional students may be served in a VE class.  The following descriptions
have been developed by the Bureau of Education for Exceptional Students
(<i>Educating Exceptional Students</i>, 1993) and are provided to define and
describe educational characteristics related to each exceptionality.

<h4><A NAME = "Autistic">Autistic</A></h4><br>
<P>
<i>Student Characteristics</i><br>
<br>
<p>Autism is a behaviorally-defined syndrome characterized by severe
problems in learning, communication, and social interaction.  Although autism
is a lifelong disability for which there is no known cure, persons with this
disorder can make substantial progress through intervention programs in
education, speech and language therapy, and other disciplines.<br>
<br>
<p>The term "autism" refers to a collection of behavioral symptoms which normally
are diagnosed during infancy or early childhood and may have more than one
cause.  Behavioral characteristics may vary significantly among individuals
with autism.  These characteristics include cognitive, behavioral, social, and
communication deficits.  <br>
<br>
<i>Educational Characteristics</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive levels of functioning vary dramatically within this
population.  Levels may range from the profoundly disabled who display a number
of physical problems, to high functioning individuals who are socially
integrated with the community.<br>
<br>
<li>Many individuals show unevenness in their developmental profile.  Splinter
skills within and between academic areas often evidence this uneven skill
development.<br>
<br>
<li>Most individuals evidence speech which is noncommunicative and language skills
which are dysfunctional.  There may be markedly abnormal nonverbal
communication, such as lack of eye contact or inability to refocus attention as
the situation changes.  There may be marked impairment in the ability to
initiate or sustain a conversation.<br>
<br>
<li>Many individuals may ignore the presence of others and remain aloof and
indifferent to social contact.  Interest in objects may be greater than
interest in people. Some may show an inability to make friends with others in
the classroom.<br>
<br>
<li>Some individuals may lack appropriate affect in relation to environmental
stimulation.  They may become extremely upset without obvious provocation,
resulting in tantrumming behavior of considerable duration or intensity.<br>
<br>
<li>Hypo- or hyper-sensitivity are often characteristic reactions to stimuli.
Individuals with autism may demonstrate insensitivity or lack of response to
pain, or they may overreact to a common environmental noise such as a school
bell.

<A NAME = "Dual Sensory Impaired"></A><h4>Dual Sensory Impaired</h4><br>
<P>
<P>

<i>Student Characteristics</i>
<p>Students with "dual sensory impairments" have both a vision and a hearing loss
and are sometimes referred to as "deaf-blind."  The combination of sensory
losses creates severe communication and other developmental and learning needs
that require special education and related services.  Communication and
mobility are the most seriously affected areas for students with dual sensory
impairments.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Educational Characteristics</i><br>
<ul>
<li>Students communicate through facial expression, body movement, and
various vocalizations that may seem unintelligible.  Staff should acknowledge
and expand communication attempts so that students can develop effective means
of communication.<br>
<br>
<li>Students with little functional use of their vision or hearing are often
unable to understand what is going to happen to them. Staff should develop
touch cues (specific signals of events or requests) and use them consistently
in daily routines.<br>
<br>
<li>Students with severe impairments react more positively to a stranger if
approached using a gentle touch to the shoulder as a cue.<br>
<br>
<li>Students must be taught appropriate touch, tolerating touch, and exploration
strategies.

<h4><A NAME = "Emotionally Handicapped">Emotionally Handicapped and Severely Emotionally Disturbed</A></h4><br>
<P>

<i>Student Characteristics</i><br>
<br>
<p>The student who has an emotional handicap exhibits one or more of the
following characteristics, to the extent that he or she is unable to take
advantage of or participate in the regular education program:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Inability to learn cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health
factors.<br>
<br>
<li>Demonstrates inappropriate types of behaviors or feelings under normal
circumstances.<br>
<br>
<li>General mood is one of unhappiness or depression.<br>
<br>
<li>Tendency to develop physical symptoms, pain, or fears associated with personal
or school problems.<br>
<br>
<li>Unable to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with
peers or teacher.<br>
<br>
<li>Demonstrates a variety of excessive behaviors, ranging from hyperactive and
aggressive responses to severe depression and withdrawal.<br>
<br>
</ul>
<p>All student characteristics must be examined as they are impacted by the
context of educational settings (academic and social), home, and community.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Educational Considerations</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Students should be provided with a structured learning environment to provide
for skill acquisition in behavior control strategies, academic achievement, and
socialization.<br>
<br>
<li>Classroom rules for group control and structure for targeting behaviors should
be key elements in the learning environment.<br>
<br>
<li>Many have academic problems, particularly in reading comprehension, social
studies, and math problem solving.  These areas should be emphasized in the
curriculum.<br>

<h4><A NAME = "Gifted">Gifted</A></h4><br>
<P><br>
<p>Gifted students are rarely served in a VE model.  However, students with other
exceptionalities occasionally exhibit characteristics associated with
giftedness, and these may be used as clues to appropriate learning
interventions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Student Characteristics</i><br>
<br>
<p>There is no one type of giftedness; therefore, no single instructional
modification is effective for all gifted students.  Most effective teaching
strategies emphasize flexibility and sensitivity to the characteristics of
gifted students, and provision of opportunities to experience the breadth of a
concept to match the student's curiosity.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>General Characteristics</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Learn skills efficiently, with little practice.<br>
<br>
<li>Interpret nonverbal cues and draw inferences independently.<br>
<br>
<li>Work independently at an earlier age and for longer periods of time.<br>
<br>
<li>Often have wildly eclectic interests and are intensely focused.<br>
<br>
<li>Have seemingly boundless energy; may be misdiagnosed as hyperactive.<br>
<br>
<li>Are able to relate well to adults and older children.<br>
<br>
</ul>
<i>Learning Characteristics</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Show keen powers of observation; have an eye for important details.<br>
<br>
<li>Prefer structure, organization, and consistency in their environment.<br>
<br>
<li>Are often skeptical, critical, and evaluative.<br>
<br>
<li>Have a ready grasp of underlying principles; can make generalizations.<br>
<br>
<li>Can attack complicated material and analyze it systematically.<br>
<br>
<li>Have well developed common sense.<br>
<br>
</ul>
<i>Behavioral Characteristics</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Are often well organized, goal-directed, and efficient.<br>
<br>
<li>Exhibit intrinsic motivation to learn, find out, and explore.<br>
<br>
<li>Have a highly developed moral and ethical sense.<br>
<br>
<li>Can integrate opposing impulses.<br>
<br>
<li>Often seem to be daydreaming.<br>
<br>
<li>May seek to conceal their abilities.<br>
<br>
<li>Have a well developed sense of self and realistic ideas about their
capabilities.<br>

<h4><A NAME = "Hearing Impaired">Hearing Impaired</A></h4><br>

<P>
<i>Student Characteristics</i><br>
<br>
<p>The term "hearing impaired" refers to people with all types of hearing
disabilities, ranging from a very slight loss to profound deafness.  Whether
the hearing loss occurred before or after the student acquired language often
determines the type of support services the individual student will need in
order to succeed. <br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Educational Considerations</i><br>
<br>
<p>The diversity of manifestations makes it necessary to consider each
student as an individual with unique characteristics and educational needs.<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Some students have difficulty accepting their hearing loss and are
inconsistent in wearing their hearing aids.  Hearing aids only partially
compensate for an individual's hearing impairment.  Individual students may
exhibit speech, language, and communication problems.<br>
<br>
<li>Some students communicate orally; others use speech and sign language.
Students may need the assistance of an interpreter or notetaker.  Sign language
interpreters may sign and speak at the same time.  Oral interpreters voice
without using signs.<br>
<br>
<li>Optimum acoustical conditions must be provided for students with hearing
impairments.  Any extraneous noise makes it more difficult for students to
interpret oral language.  To reduce reverberation, the classroom should be
equipped with sound-absorbing materials such as carpet, cloth curtains, and
acoustical ceiling tile.<br>
<br>
<li>Adequate lighting is needed to help with the comprehension of information
through speech reading and visual aids.  In addition, amplification is needed
to assist students in understanding what is being said.  Students may have
difficulty processing both the visual information and the classroom
conversation at the same time.<br>
<br>
</ul>
<i>Suggestions for Classroom Routines</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Speak normally when talking; hearing aids increase the loudness of sounds.<br>
<br>
<li>Write assignments on the board.<br>
<br>
<li>Encourage students to ask for statements to be repeated.  Rephrase the
statements, if they do not understand.<br>
<br>
<li>Students may fatigue more readily because of the continuous visual and
auditory strain of keeping up with the classroom activity.<br>
<br>
<li>Allow students to sit where they can have direct eye contact with the speaker
and interpreter.<br>
<br>
<li>Avoid standing in front of windows and other light sources when speaking to
students.<br>

<h4><A NAME = "Mentally Handicapped">Mentally Handicapped</A></h4><br>
<P>
<i>Student Characteristics</i><br>
<br>
<p>People with a mental handicap develop at a below-average rate and
experience difficulty in learning and social adjustment.  "Mentally retarded
means significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, existing
concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested during the
developmental period, that adversely affects a student's educational
performance" (<i>Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--IDEA</i>).<br>
<br>
<p>In educational settings, students with mental handicaps may be determined
eligible for one of three groups based on their ability to learn and their
ability to be independent and socially responsible:<br>

<LI><A NAME = "Educable Mentally Handicapped (EMH)">Educable Mentally Handicapped (EMH)</A>
<P>
<P>
<p>Students are mildly impaired in intellectual and adaptive behavioral skills.
IQ is approximately 55-70 and assessed adaptive behavior falls below age and
cultural expectations.  These students can learn about 50% to 75% of what a
typical student can learn and understand.  They usually have a short attention
span and do not retain information readily.<br>

<i>Educational Considerations</i><br>

<ul>
<li>Teachers may  need to use many clear, unambiguous verbal cues; prompts;
physical guidance; and modeling to help these students learn at a more
efficient rate.  Students need frequent feedback and reinforcement.  <br>
<br>
<li>Students can learn a broad range of subjects including basic skills, social
studies, science, and health and personal care.  An important component is
preparation for a vocation and community living. <br>

<P>
Students identified as TMH are moderately or severely impaired in intellectual
and adaptive behavior and have a reduced rate of learning.  IQ is approximately
25-55 and assessed adaptive behavior falls significantly below age and cultural
expectations.  Students can learn about 25% to 50% of what a typical student
can learn and understand.  In addition, they may have cardiac or neurological
sensory disorders.<br>
<i>Educational Considerations</i><br>
<ul>
<li>Students may require many services provided through an interdisciplinary team
approach.<br> 
<li>Curriculum should include activities of daily living, preparation and
participation in a supported employment program, and transition services for
life after school.<br>

<LI> <A NAME = "Profoundly Mentally Handicapped (PMH)">Profoundly Mentally Handicapped (PMH)</A><P>

<p>Students identified as PMH are profoundly impaired in intellectual and adaptive
behavior and have a reduced rate of learning.  IQ is approximately 25 or below
and assessed adaptive behavior falls very significantly below age and cultural
expectations.  Students have little response to most social stimuli and limited
awareness of their environment.  Communication is very limited, and they may
display temper tantrums, self-injurious behaviors, self-stimulation, and
seizures.  Many have other serious conditions as well, such as cerebral palsy
or blindness.<br>
<i>Educational Considerations</i><br>
<ul>
<li>Students benefit from social stimulation and communication training.<br>
<br>
<li>Many students require assistive technology for ambulation, self-care, and
health maintenance.<br>
<br>
<li>Teachers need to work with the adult agencies to which these students may
transition after graduation and help the students develop the appropriate
behavioral skills for this transition.<br>

<h4><A NAME = "Physically Impaired">Physically Impaired</A></h4><P>
<P>
<i>Student Characteristics</i><P>
<br>
<p>A physical impairment is a physically disabling condition resulting from
a health impairment, an orthopedic condition, or a traumatic brain injury which
requires an adaptation to the student's school environment or curriculum.
Physical impairments include physical problems present at birth as well as
physical problems resulting from other causes.  Neurological problems, such as
cerebral palsy, may be included in this category.<br>
<br>
<p>Health impairments may result in reduced efficiency in school work because of
temporary or chronic lack of strength, vitality, or alertness.  Asthma, cardiac
conditions, leukemia, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are
examples of health impairments that could interfere with a student's
education.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Educational Considerations</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The effect of a physical impairment can vary from little or none to a
complete restructuring of daily life.  Severely involved students may require
intensive health care and educational assistance.<br>
<br>
<li>Physical impairments may interfere with the student's motor functioning,
communication, learning skills, or social development.<br>
<br>
<li>Physical, occupational, and speech and language therapy are often central to
the education of students with physical impairments.  The greatest progress is
achieved when therapy suggestions are consistently applied in the student's
home as well as throughout the school environment.<br>
<br>
<li>Programs may need to be made assessible by  structural changes (adding ramps
or elevators) or schedule or location changes.<br>
<br>
<li>Physical impairments can affect the student's emotional and social
development.  Avoid overprotection and encourage students to participate within
limits of safety and health.<br>
<br>
<li>Adaptive equipment can be used to enable students with physical impairments to
function more normally.<br>

<h4><A NAME = "Specific Learning Disabilities">Specific Learning Disabilities</A></h4><P>
<P>
<i>Student Characteristics</i><P>
<br>
<p>A specific learning disability is a condition which affects one of the
basic psychological processes involved in understanding or using language.  A
psychological process is considered to be the combined operations involved in
gathering, storing, or retrieving information through sensory channels.  The
disability can appear in areas such as listening, thinking, reading, talking,
writing, or arithmetic.  Learning disabilities cannot be attributed to a
vision, hearing, or motor disability, a mental handicap, an emotional
disturbance, or environmental deprivation.<br>
<br>
<p>Specific learning disability delays are typically in spoken language or
listening skills, error patterns in written language (including reading),
difficulty in grasping math concepts or performing basic arithmetic operations,
and difficulty in applying organizational skills.  These characteristics may be
evident in several areas of performance.  Identification of specific learning
disabilities is possible when a discrepancy exists between a student's
estimated ability and actual performance level. <br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Educational Considerations</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The disability can have a mild to severe impact on students' academic
performance.<br>
<br>
<li>Classroom organization providing a high level of structure, defined routines,
and clearly stated rules and assignments are helpful to many students.<br>
<br>
<li>Flexibility in allotment of time to complete assignments and in the use of
classroom space and equipment provides students an increased opportunity to be
successful.<br>
<br>
<li>Modifications in instructional methods, such as activities to support lessons
(study guides or advance organizers), assist students to master key concepts
and content.<br>
<br>
<li>Instructional materials can be modified by compressing or paraphrasing texts,
developing additional practice materials, or reducing the number of items
required to show proficiency.<br>
<br>
<li>Assessment procedures that allow alternative presentation of questions and
responses can enable students to demonstrate competencies.  Clear instructions
and expectations must be provided.<br>

<h4><A NAME = "Speech and Language Impaired">Speech and Language Impaired</A></h4><P>
<P>
<i>Student Characteristics</i><P>
<br>
<p>Speech and language impairments refer to problems in communication,
i.e., the ability to understand or appropriately use speech and language
systems.  Such disorders may range from simple sound repetitions or occasional
misarticulations to the absence of the ability to use speech and language for
communication.  A language impairment is the inability to use the symbols of
language through proper use of words and their meanings, appropriate
grammatical patterns, and proper use of speech sounds.  A speech impairment is
difficulty in producing speech sounds (articulation), maintaining speech rhythm
(fluency), and controlling vocal production (voice).<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Educational Considerations</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Students with a communication disorder may have difficulty learning
basic academic subjects.<br>
<br>
<li>As students progress through school, increased demands in the language of
learning can result in great difficulty for students with speech or language
impairments.<br>
<br>
<li>Some students may encounter isolation in educational, vocational, social, and
emotional areas.<br>
<br>
<li>Technology can assist students whose physical condition makes communication
difficult.  The use of augmentative or assistive communication devices allows
limited-speaking or nonspeaking students to engage in meaningful
communication.<br>

<dl>
<dt>"Partially sighted" 
<dd>refers to students who have corrected vision between 20/200
and 20/70 and who may require the use of special materials for learning.<br>
<br>
<br>
<dt>"Low vision" 
<dd>refers to students who may be partially sighted or legally blind
and who require adaptations that may include Braille.<br>
<br>
<br>
<dt>"Legally blind" 
<dd>refers to students who have corrected vision of less than
20/200 or a very limited field of vision and who require the use of special
materials for learning.<br>
<br>
<br>
<dt>"Totally blind" 
<dd>refers to students who have no light perception and who require
Braille or other nonvisual media for learning.<br>
<br>
</dl>
<p>The effect of visual problems on a student's development depends on the
severity and type of loss, the age of onset, and the overall functioning level
of the child.  Many children who have multiple handicaps may also have visual
impairments which result in further motor, cognitive, and/or social
developmental delays.  Many children who have a visual impairment are not
motivated to explore their environment because of lack of visual stimuli.  They
may appear uninterested, overprotected, and antisocial due to the impact of
their visual impairment.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Educational Considerations</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Special materials, including Braille, large print, and taped textbooks and
supplemental reading materials; special technology, including adaptive
computers, low-vision optical aids, and print-enlarging equipment; and
modifications to curricula may be necessary for students with visual
impairments.<br>
<br>
<li>Students may require special instruction in daily living skills, social
skills, orientation and mobility (independent movement in the environment),
communication (Braille), or vocational/career options.<br>
<br>
<li>Students with visual impairments are typically mainstreamed and receive
special instruction in Braille, daily living skills, and social behaviors.
