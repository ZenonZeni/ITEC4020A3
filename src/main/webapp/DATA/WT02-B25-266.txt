<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Effects Of Dietary Intake On Psychiatric Medications</font>
<P>
	Because neurotransmitters are synthesized primarily from 
dietary amino acids and neuronal electrical charges are governed 
primarily by minerals, our basic diet can have profound effect on 
the ability of a medication to have a therapeutic effect on mood, 
thinking, and behavior.  Conversely, medications can have an 
equally profound effect on the way our body uses food.  It is 
critical that anyone taking any psychiatric medications have a 
balanced diet using the new food pyramid as a guide.  It is 
impossible to document all the possible drug and food interactions 
in this article, but I have listed a few of the common ones.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Salt</font>
<P>
	Salt is needed for all nervous system functions.  Lithium is a 
naturally occurring mineral with an electrical charge similar to 
salt.  Therefore, the level of salt in the body automatically 
affects the action of lithium.  Once the lithium level reaches 
therapeutic range, it can be altered by subtle changes in daily 
salt intake.  For instance, a person who normally doesn't eat much 
salt can have a decreased lithium level by eating salty foods such 
as pizza, tomato juice, or canned soups.  People eating too much 
salt may be accused of not taking their lithium when actually they 
have been very compliant.  Conversely, losing sodium by sweating, 
diarrhea, or vomiting can cause the body to retain lithium.  
Lithium toxicity can occur in this way.  Please consult a dietician 
if you are interested in more information about salt.  Do not go on 
a salt-restricted diet or add salt supplements without consulting 
the person who prescribes medication for you.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Sugar</font>
<P>
	Sugar is needed by every cell in the body, particularly those 
in the brain.  The brain has an absolute requirement of 100-150 
grams (1000-1500mg) of glucose per day with the resting state 
consuming 20-30 percent.  It is best to keep glucose levels 
constant, not fluctuating.  One 12-ounce can of a cola-type soda 
has 40 grams of carbohydrate in the form of sucrose, or table 
sugar.  A two-liter bottle has 64 ounces--more than 200 grams of 
sugar!  Obviously this amount can give the brain quite a jolt.  
Excessive sugar also stresses the pancreas by causing it to produce 
extra insulin to handle the extra sugar.  The result is fluctuating 
blood-sugar levels that will obviously affect the brain.
<P>
	Sugar also affects mood.  Sugar in the form of simple 
carbohydrates (table sugar) stimulates insulin release that 
increases tryptophan-to-serotonin (a mood chemical) conversion on a 
short-term basis.  Complex carbohydrates such as bagels, pretzels, 
and oatmeal facilitate a long-term conversion causing a sort of 
time-released serotonin.  Many people who have a serotonin 
imbalance actually increase the imbalance by erratic eating 
patterns.
    <P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Chocolate</font>
<P>
	Chocolate is a sugar/fat combination.  Fats stimulate the 
release of endorphins (natural pain killers) and sugar stimulates 
serotonin.  Chocolate also contains phenylethylamine (the chemical 
reported to be released when a person falls in love), theobromine 
(a mild stimulant), and caffeine. 
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Caffeine</font>
<P>
	Pharmacologically speaking, caffeine is singularly the most 
devastating legally available stimulant anyone can ingest.  More 
than 225mg (the amount in two cups of brewed coffee or four cans of 
soda) is considered excessive.  Some of the known actions of 
caffeine include: ( "<B>+</B>" = increase and  "<B>-</B>" = decrease) 
<ul>
<li>	<B>+</B> free fatty acid mobilization (raises level of blood lipids) 
that ultimately <B>+</B> blood-sugar levels.
<li>	<B>-</B> lithium levels, even when you take it faithfully, by <B>+</B>
urinary excretion due to diuretic effects.  
<LI>	<B>-</B> effectiveness of antianxiety medications by competing with 
the same receptor sites.
<LI>	<B>-</B> gastric absorption of antipsychotic medications, especially 
haloperidol and fluphenazine.
<LI>	Leads to irregular heartbeats and <B>+</B> blood pressure with 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
<LI>	Does not improve thinking if you are intoxicated, only combats 
the depressant effect.
<LI>	If you are already taking a stimulant such as cocaine, 
caffeine can lead to death.
<LI>	If you have a panic disorder, caffeine can precipitate 
attacks.
<LI>	May alter the desired mood effects of traditional tricyclic 
antidepressants
<LI>	<B>+</B> the risk of anxiety and restlessness if taking SSRIs
<LI>	High caffeine users in general require higher doses of 
antipsychotic drugs.
</ul>
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Nicotine And Smoking</font>
<P>
	Nicotine has been under particularly close scrutiny lately.  
It has long been known to be extremely addictive, but only recently 
has research begun to uncover what it can do to prescription 
medications.  Many people taking psychiatric drugs are addicted to 
nicotine.  Nicotine is known to increase the release of dopamine in 
the brain.  This is thought to be one of the reasons why many 
consumers with schizophrenia end up needing such high doses of 
medications--the nicotine may actually counteract drugs like 
risperidone, haloperidol, and others.  Because nicotine is also a 
stimulant, it may also reduce the drowsiness caused by neuroleptics 
and antianxiety agents.
<P>
	Smoking sets up another problem.  When people smoke they 
ingest compounds called arial carbons.  These carbons induce 
powerful liver enzyme systems into action.  Liver enzymes are 
chemicals responsible for the breakdown of drugs and toxins so the 
body doesn't become toxic.  These enzymes also metabolize many 
psychiatric drugs.  Smoking in general can create interactions with 
other drugs by affecting their metabolism.  The simple act of 
smoking can raise the dose required to create a therapeutic 
responses from antipsychotic medications.  Often the required dose 
is so high it creates unpleasant side effects.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Conclusion</font>
<P>
	My intention for writing this article is to create an 
awareness of a few of the many reasons why people taking 
psychiatric drugs may not be getting the full benefit of these 
miraculous compounds.  Generally speaking, a small amount of 
medication can cause the brain to undergo profound changes.  In 
many circumstances more drug can actually equal less therapeutic 
response.  Most people taking psychiatric drugs do not require the 
high doses that can cause disabling sedation and movement 
disorders, but because of poor health the body cannot respond 
properly to the prescribed drug.  I cannot emphasize strongly 
enough how critical it is for everyone taking a psychiatric 
medication to begin the process of detoxifying the body of 
addictive substances and restore healthy organ system functioning 
with proper nutrition so the body can function in harmony with 
medications.  When the body is healthy and rested, the mind will 
function much more efficiently.  To borrow a famous quote, "The 
mind is a terrible thing to waste."
