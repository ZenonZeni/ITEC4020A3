<h1><a href="Feb_96.htm#In This Issue . . ."
name="Right on Target">Right on Target</a></h1>

<p><img src="../images/Feb_961.gif" width="455" height="311"> </p>

<p>Our predictions in last month's issue were &#147;on
target&#148; on several counts. The first was the Federal Reserve
Board of Governor's (Hereafter referred as FED) lowering of key
interest rates. As predicted the FED lowered rates by 1/4 of a
percent at their January meeting, although the meeting lasted
longer than we expected. As expected this resulted in a surge in
bond prices. </p>

<p>Gold also surged there after a week on Budget fears as we said
it might. Gold will continue to remain volatile until a budget is
finally in place. Every rumor that a budget compromise is at hand
will deflate the price of Gold while every rumor to the contrary
will give the yellow metal a strong boost. </p>

<p>Also right on target was our prediction of Treasury Secretary
Rubin's expansion of the Treasury's borrowing power. Right on
schedule he created $19.7 Billion. This time the slight of hand
was accomplished by tapping the Civil Service Retirement Fund for
$6.4 Billion, siphoning $3.9 Billion from the currency
stabilization fund and $800 million from early payments by the
post office. The final $8.6 Billion came from &#147;The Federal
Financing Bank exchanging assets for Treasury securities,&#148; <em>i.e.,</em>
monetizing the debt. This slight of hand was one of Dr. Moore's
pet peeves. He was fond of saying the FED is a private bank not
at all &#147;Federal&#148; and the &#147;assets&#148; are not any
more real than the paper they were exchanged for. </p>

<p>At this point we don't know how many more tricks Rubin has up
his sleeve, but at some point all he will have left up his sleeve
is his arm! Let's hope a budget compromise is at hand before
then.. </p>

<p>With both Bonds and Gold surging, the thought that must remain
upper-most in our minds is the performance of the <b>ratio</b> of
Gold to Bonds. This concept was referred to by Dr. Moore as
&#147;opposite pairs.&#148;</p>

<p>The concept is of primary importance in our investment
strategy so I have included a chart of this ratio here. I have
also decided because of its extreme supreme importance to our
investment strategy that it will be a regular part of coming
issues. </p>

<p>As we can see from point &#147;A&#148; through point
&#147;C&#148; the ratio was in a basic uptrend. An interesting
point to note is that through the months of November and December
both Gold and Bonds were performing well (<i>i.e.</i> rising) at
first glance that may seem inconsistent to our basic premise of
&#147;opposites&#148;. </p>

<p>Obviously, Gold and Bonds do not have a true 100% negative
correlation. In actuality, the average gold and bond mutual funds
over the last 8 years have had a negative .17 correlation. This
means that about 58.5% of the time they react oppositely but
41.5% percent of the time they travel in the same direction! At
first this may appear to invalidate our opposites theory but this
is why we must focus on the ratio! </p>

<p>By using the MIP we can predict which factor should be
outperforming the other and by combining other indicators we
refine the timing for the switch point. </p>

<p>Remember, in the market there are very few natural absolutes.
The only truly negative correlation's are &#147;artificial&#148;
such as those created by the Rydex funds, in whichwhere one is
simply a mirror of the other. I was recently asked by a
subscriber why we don't use such funds. There are several
reasons,. The main ones are the high minimum investment
requirements and the extreme timing accuracy needed (which would
be virtually impossible in a monthly newsletter). </p>

<p>As I mentioned several issues ago our major concern is to
continually compound the number of shares we own. To do this we
want to be in the fund that is performing the best of our pair.
Suppose we switched into Gold funds at point &#147;A&#148; when
the ratio is .47 and into Bonds again at point &#147;C&#148; with
the ratio at .64. In this one single round trip we would have
been able to increase our share holdings by about 36%. This was
accomplished in a couple of short months! This is based strictly
on the ratio and it does not matter whether one rose while the
other fell or whether both rose or both fell. All that matters is
that we have increased the number of shares that we own. </p>

<p>The reason the actual price does not matter in the short run
is because in the long run both bonds and gold tend to be flat!
It may seem to be a bit contradictory but it is true. </p>

<p>The major point most &#147;gold bugs&#148; rely upon is that
gold tends to retain its value in times of inflation (and at
other times as well). Bonds on the other hand lock in a fixed
number of dollars which the purchaser is guaranteed at some point
in the future. Both these are signs of stability(In the long
run)! </p>

<p>(In the long run.) However, in the short term, however, the
ratio gets extremely out of whack. When this happens, we have the
opportunity to compound the number of shares we hold and await
the eventual return to normalcy. </p>

<p>Over the last 5 years the ratio has been as high as 1.25 and
as low as .456 , but overall it has reversed direction many
times. </p>

<p>Since, our major consideration is timing those reversals, I
have been working on developing a more conservative approach to
tracking the trend. </p>

<p>Our Relative Strength Index (RSI) has a &#147;hair
trigger&#148; and is usually quite early in predicting turns. It
signaled a turn in the making in early January. This is an
excellent <b>early warning system</b> but we must combine it with
other indicators to consistently profit from the reversals.
Without charting the actual ratio it is extremely difficult to
see where we stand. </p>

<p>So in addition to the &#147;early warning system&#148; of RSI,
I am going to be including the &#147;Late warning system&#148; of
the moving average (see chart on page 1). By definition when the
actual price (in this case the ratio) crosses through its moving
average a change in direction is signaled. By definition this <b>always</b>
happens<b> after</b> the turn has occurred. </p>

<p>As we can see at circle &#147;B&#148; if we rely strictly upon
this crossing we have missed a portion of the up move. The
crossing, however, is a good confirmation that the direction has
in fact switched. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, moving averages are not perfect., as we can see
in the weeks following point &#147;B,&#148; we received several
&#147;whipsaw&#148; signals, signaling several reversals. These
whipsaws can be reduced by using a longer term moving average. </p>

<p>but However, the longer the average the larger the portions of
the move to be missed. For our purposes the 4 week average
appears to be fairly good when combined with the Moore Inflation
Predictor (MIP). In the November - December period, for instance,
we would ignore the whipsaws because the MIP had not turned yet. </p>

<p><b><i>In future issues I will be basing the Conservative
approach which will rely Portfolio more heavily upon the moving
average while the more aggressive approach Portfolio will rely
more upon the RSI,. Both will still rely heavily upon the
extremely accurate MIP for overall timing indications.</i></b> </p>

<p>Turns usually occur when the price (ratio) is at an extreme
distance from the moving average, such as we see at both points
&#147;A&#148; and &#147;C.&#148; I fully expected point
&#147;D&#148; to cross the average but a final spike in gold
prices combined with a drop in Government Bonds (probably due to
market and budget worries) caused a bounce off the average. </p>

<p>The ensuing rise appears to be ending, so by the time you read
this we may have a downward moving average penetration and if so
it will be noted on our Hotline [(804) 929-6732]. </p>

<p>I firmly believe the addition of the ratio chart and moving
average will greatly enhance our performance over the coming
months and conservative investors still have time to make the
switch to bond funds. Truly conservative investors should wait
for the penetration confirming the change in trend direction. <b>The
Bond </b>(see Back Page)<b> Relative Strength Index (RSI) is
currently indicating a very strong buy signal.</b> </p>

<p><img src="../images/Feb_962.gif" width="455" height="311"></p>

<p>As we can see, the MIP shows we have a long way to go down in
interest rates over the next few months. The shutdown of the
Government shutdown during December and January may have skewed
the figures a bit because of the significant decrease in the
money being pumped into the economy by government employees. </p>

<p>Baring an &#147;accident&#148; like a major outbreak of war or
budget battles we should continue to see bonds perform well for
the next several months. Our term, coined by Jim Moore, for these
&#147;accidents&#148; is Abnormally Severe Market Aberrations
(ASMA's).(ASMA's). </p>

<p>As investors we must watch the news for these ASMA's and try
to determine the eventual effect of them upon our investments. </p>

<p>At this point many market participants seem to believe that
Budget battles are good for Gold (and to the extent that they
lead to market uncertainty they are) but that is only a short
term effect. In the long term having no budget is actually
restrictive on the money supply and has the exact opposite
effect. </p>

<p>The reason for this is simple,: when no budget is passed
congress eventually funds &#147;essential&#148; operations. By
definition essential operations are less than the total so some
funds are not spent. The other option often chosen when there is
no budget is to fund all operations at <b>last year's</b> levels.
This has historically been less than the proposed budget. and so
not having a budget is actually zero inflation from last year. </p>

<p>If politicians really wanted to balance the budget all they
would have to do is use the previous year's budget over and over
until it finally balanced. In effect that is what we have so far
this fiscal year (<i>i.e.</i> since October). </p>

<p>This defacto fiscal restraint has already significantly
impacted the CPI calculations and should result in some
significant increases in bonds over the next few months. In
addition, however, we will probably see some erratic behavior in
the price of gold as uncertainty in the market sporadically rears
its ugly head. </p>

<p>The almost 1% drop in the projected median CPI will result in
a significant rise in bonds over the next six6 months. At this
point a 30% gain in bonds is not hard to foresee. </p>

<p>As we can see from the CPI-Data chart on the following page
both November and December 1995 actually had <b>Deflation</b>
(i.e. prices actually fell) rather than simply rising at a slower
rate. Deflation is wonderful for bonds because in addition to
appreciation, you actually get paid in dollars that have greater
purchasing power than current dollars! </p>

name="Reading The MIP Chart "><b>Reading The MIP Chart</b> </a></h3>

<p>The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Chart is primarily a
predictor of the inflation rate for the coming 12 months. It is
extremely accurate over a six month time frame and accurately
forecasts turning points out to the 1 year mark. </p>

<p>The vertical axis is the inflation rate in percentage terms
while the horizontal axis is the date. The left side of the chart
is the actual historical Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). While the
right side is the predicted CPI-U. </p>

<p>The right side consists of several diverging lines starting at
a &#147;You are here&#148; arrow. The median line is the most
likely prediction for the future CPI-U with likely highs and lows
diverging from it and extreme highs and lows further out. </p>

<p>By focusing on the median line you can easily see future
turning points in the CPI-U index. An increase in this index
usually translates to an increase in the price of gold, gold
stocks and other precious metals and commodities. A decrease in
the CPI-U index usually indicates a decrease in inflation hedges
and an increase in Bonds, Utilities and other interest sensitive
instruments. </p>

<p><b>CPI Data-</b> By annualizing the CPI-U Data from various
time spans we can get an idea of the likely range over the next
year's time frame. Keep in mind that 1 and 2 month rates have
very little long-term significance. </p>

<p><b>The Basic Portfolio-</b> For the simplest portfolio stay
with the Benham Family. We have chosen Benham for three reasons. </p>

<p>1) It has a good Gold Fund. 2) It has a long term Bond Fund
that is usually the most volatile (i.e. provides the greatest
upside potential during up moves) 3) It has several alternatives
for parking funds during periods of uncertainty. </p>

<p>Use Benham 2020 when we recommend a Bond Fund and Benham Gold
Equity Index Fund for periods when Gold Funds are recommended. </p>

<p><b>New Money-</b> Any funds recently freed up should follow
the &#147;New Money&#148; indicator. </p>

<p><b>Volatility- </b>Our greatest ally and biggest foe is
volatility. We rely upon large changes in the prices of our funds
during relatively short periods of time. This can result in short
term losses if we switch directions too early. This is referred
to as &#147;draw down&#148; i.e. in the long run we made money
but in the mean time, our account showed a temporary paper loss.
Some investors have difficulty handling large draw downs. They
should follow the conservative approach. </p>

<p><b>Diversification-</b> All investors should diversify by
investing a portion of their portfolio using several other
investment approaches including- well selected individual
securities, mutual funds and other appropriate investments. Our
goal is to maximize overall portfolio performance with a minimum
of risk. </p>

<p><b>Insurance Gold- </b>Every investor should have a portion
(usually 10-15% or 1yrs living expenses) of their assets in
physical Gold and/or Silver (coins and/or bullion). This should
be considered insurance against market chaos and is not an
investment. The cost of this insurance is the interest missed. </p>
