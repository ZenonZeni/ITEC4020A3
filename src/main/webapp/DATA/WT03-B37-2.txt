UNION SEEKS COURT-ORDERED BAN OF MEXICAN TRUCKS

The Teamsters Union is seeking a court order banning Mexican trucks from
entering the U.S. unless drivers show evidence that DOT safety rules are met.
A ruling favoring the union would require Mexican truckers to show custom
officials proof of insurance and other documents demonstrating compliance
with hazardous materials and rules.

Under North American Free Trade Agreement provisions effective in Decem-ber,
Mexican trucks gained access to U.S. roads in Arizona, California, New Mexico
and Texas.  While the treaty requires them to comply with DOT rules when in
the U.S., the Teamsters allege drivers are being waved through after signing
compliance check-off forms rather than undergoing safety inspections.  On
Dec. 15, the union asked the D.C. circuit appeals court for an emergency stay
halting Mexican cross-border trucking.

The Teamsters allege DOT knows Mexican truckers often fail to maintain
adequate insurance, are not licensed or properly qualified, operate unsafe
vehicles and fail to assure safety when carrying dangerous materials.  It
noted a one-day inspection in October by the Texas Railroad Commission found
evidence of fraudulent insurance coverage by trucks entering the state.  The
union asked that trucks be barred until DOT sets up a centralized enforcement
system.  A court ruling is expected by February.

CDL ENFORCEMENT GETS BOOST VIA HIGHWAY BILL

State transportation agencies will receive $5.4 billion in federal funds
during 1996 with significant increases in aid to administer the national
commercial driver's license (CDL) program.  The money, authorized by National
Highway System (NHS) legislation enacted in December, includes a nearly 15%
boost in federal funds to enforce CDL rules for trucks carrying hazardous
materials.  The measure also calls for additional increases of up to 10% in
1997 and 1998 to assist states in CDL compliance.

To qualify, states must show DOT they will use funding to meet CDL
inspections and enforcement program standards.  Aid will go only to states
that maintain record-keeping systems and participate in a national DOT data
base program to track records on drivers, truck and equipment inspections and
traffic accidents involving commercial vehicles.  An intended benefit of the
plan is to help DOT gather data on number of licensed hazardous materials
drivers and quantities of hazardous materials transported.

Some 1.1 million roadside inspections now are done annually and higher
allocations will allow those to increase, DOT said.  The program also
includes funding for drug and alcohol enforcement.  DOT noted that in 1992,
federal aid helped several states set up drug-free zones within 1,000 feet of
truck stops, doubling penalties for selling of drugs there.

In addition to hailing increased CDL funding, DOT Secretary Federico Pena
called the National Highway System the "backbone of America's transportation
network."  The 165,000-mile road system includes the current Interstate
system as well as other major state and federal highways.  Although it
comprises only 4% of the nation's roads, NHS carries about 40% of all traffic
and some 75% of truck traffic.  NHS roads also represent over 90% of the
approved hazardous materials routing network.

RAILROAD INCIDENT REPORTING CHANGES DELAYED

The new incident reporting rules have been delayed at least until April to
let the Federal Railroad Administration consider questions from railroads on
company-managed control programs.  FRA is considering industry proposals to
omit a provision that railroads maintain in-house controls to ensure that
reports are filed for each incident.

Arguing that in-house programs would be burdensome, railroads urged FRA to
adopt a "99% performance standard."  By dividing the number of reported
accidents by the number of actual accidents, companies say they could compare
reporting rates against a 99% standard to determine whether reporting
performance is satisfactory.

While agreeing that a 99% performance rate would be acceptable, FRA said that
before adopting such an approach it would consider adding penalties for
companies falling short of the standard.  It asked for industry input on a
plan where fines increased for each percentage point below 99%.  The agency
suggested $1,000 for 98%; $3,000 for 97%; $9,000 for 96%, and so on.

FRA noted that changes in accident reporting standards would not alter
corrective action reporting required when non-compliance citations involve
assessment of civil penalties.  Such reporting is limited to physical defects
in rail equipment, such as cracks in hazardous material cargo tanks;
insufficient record keeping, such as tracking engineer time-on-duty; and
failure to file safety violation reports.

PRIOR NOTICE TIME CUT FOR DOCK-SIDE GAS TRANSFERS

Liquefied gas transfer operators at shipping ports have been granted relief
from section 127.131(a) "prior notification" rules.  Despite overall Coast
Guard tightening of gas unloading standards, beginning Jan. 1 liquefied gas
facilities may give port authorities only four hours notice before cargo
transfers.

Facility operators had argued against the 24-hour notice saying frequent
changes in weather or tides made arrival schedules uncertain.  The Coast
Guard agreed after company logs showed facilities often cannot know 24 hours
in advance when ships will arrive.

Though willing to relax notification time, the Coast Guard said other rules
tightening liquefied hazardous gas transfers would go forward in 1996.  These
include more rigid procedures for monitoring unloading operations and
requirements that automatic transfer shutdown equipment be installed.  Data
collected since 1985 on deaths and property damage resulting from accidents
during liquefied gas transfers indicate current rules are "unjustifiably
lax," the Coast Guard said.

TRUCK SIZE DEBATE ADDS TO NAFTA IMPLEMENTATION WOES

U.S. and Mexican transportation officials will meet in January to try to iron
out differences regarding size of trucks allowed into Mexico under the North
American Free Trade Agreement.  While U.S. truckers are protesting entrance
of Mexican trucks into border states [see story p. 1], Mexico is attempting
to ban on its roads 53-foot-long trailers, the dominant size used by U.S.
companies.

Three days before the Dec. 18 border opening, Mexican custom officials said
the trailers would not be let into the country for equipment "safety rea-
sons" related to truck length and hazardous cargoes that could be hauled.

After strong protests from U.S. transportation and trade representatives,
Mexico agreed to permit the trailers as long as the entire vehicle did not
exceed 68 feet.  Carriers claim this would effectively halt U.S. trailer
entry into Mexico because few 53-foot trailer rigs are less than 68 feet
long.

The issue appears to have stemmed from internal conflicts between Mexican
transportation officials and border-area custom houses, private businesses
that enforce rules at crossings.  According to Dave Berry, VP at Swift
Transportation of Phoenix, the Mexican transportation agency would like
differences resolved so transborder shipments can proceed, but customhouses
are being responsive to Mexican domestic trucking problems.

U.S. Trade representative Mickey Cantor expressed hope that the January talks
would resolve the problem.  In the interim, certain trailers may cross only
if interline arrangements are made so that U.S. trailers are towed into
Mexico by Mexican drivers.

PORTABLE TANKS BANNED FOR PEROXIDE SHIPMENTS

Shippers have until Oct. 1 to line up new packaging to replace non-
specification portable tanks now used to transport certain hydrogen
peroxides.  Under HM-181E provisions effective on that date, portable tanks
no longer will be approved packaging.  Instead, shippers will be subject to
intermediate bulk container (IBC) rules which ban non-specification packaging
for bulk peroxide shipments.

Final rule HM-181E, which specifies intermediate bulk containers as the DOT-
approved packaging for bulk peroxide shipments, defines IBCs as "packaging
other than a portable tank" used for hazardous cargo shipments.

However, the rule allows hazardous materials, except for those poisonous by
inhala-tion, to be packaged until Oct. 1, 1996, according to rules in effect
on Sept. 30, 1991.  Because the HMR in 1991 allowed hydrogen peroxide to be
transported in non-specification portable tanks, IBCs are not mandatory until
Oct. 1, DOT explained.

AIR CARGO DEREGULATION NEARS FOR U.S./CANADA

Deregulation of air cargo between the U.S. and Canada could be implemented by
March under an agreement expected to spur more than $1 billion in economic
activity between the two countries.  A bilateral plan to lift restrictions on
shipments of hazardous and other cargoes was proposed in 1995 and
negotiations are scheduled for completion by March.  U.S.-Canada arrangements
now limit aircraft size, package weight and size and force some aircraft to
make return trips empty.

The new agreement would ease these constraints, unify certain hazardous cargo
rules and allow competitive pricing, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena
said.  Air transportation analysts estimate the air cargo market in both
countries could expand by close to 50% in two years under a more open treaty.

Air shippers say restrictions are an aberration of freer hemispheric trade in
the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 North American Free
Trade Agreement.  Deregulation talks began in 1991, but had been stalled
until this plan was announced.

ESCORT TUG BOAT REQUIREMENTS TO TIGHTEN IN 1996

Tanker escort rule expansion is ahead for single-hulled ships carrying
hazardous cargoes in U.S. waters, the Coast Guard said in December.  Several
ports and waterways are slated for inclusion on a February list designating
areas where tug and tow boat assistance will be required.  The action follows
1995 implementation of a rule requiring at least two escort vessels to
accompany hazardous cargo-carrying, single-hulled tankers in Prince William
Sound, Alaska, and Puget Sound, Wash.

Tug boat rules apply to single-hulled tankers over 5,000 gross tons.
Companion vessels could reduce the possibility of grounding or collision when
a tanker loses propulsion or steering, Coast Guard project manager Tom Jordan
explained.  Escort rules are mandated by the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, and are
to be in force until single-hulled ships carrying hazardous cargoes are
phased out in 2015.

A bag with four plies or more must be waterproof to qualify as a UN 5M2

A bag with four plies or more must be waterproof to qualify as a UN 5M2 paper
bag for hazardous materials use, DOT told Southern Bag, Yazoo City, Miss.
The package maker said its bags are made using four plies: the two innermost
are kraft paper, the third is a 3-mil linear low-density plastic laminated to
paper, the outermost is paper.  Plant manager Jimmy Druey explained that the
plastic side of the third ply faces in toward the packaged material and asked
if the construction meets UN 5M2 standards.

DOT cited 178.521(b)(2) requiring that bags be waterproof by the use of a
water-resistant ply as one of the two outermost plies or a water-resistant
barrier of a "suitable protective material" between the two outermost plies.
It said bags of four plies or more that meet all requirements of 178.521 and
tested per subpart M of Part 178 may be marked as a UN 5M2 paper bag.

Initial and recurrent hazardous materials training requirements for federal

Initial and recurrent hazardous materials training requirements for federal
employees were spelled out by DOT in response to inquiries from various
government agencies.  Questioners asked if it is acceptable, under initial
training rules, for a new hire to take an exam without receiving some type of
instruction from the hiring agency.  Noting that a major purpose of training
rules is to ensure that employers provide training for each hazmat employee,
DOT said the rules specify that workers whose jobs involve the transportation
of hazardous materials receive familiarization training covering the HMR.
For initial training, section 172.704(c) specifies training must occur within
90 days of hire and that each new employee must be trained before being
tested.

Questioners also asked if, under recurrent training rules, an employee with
initial training can take a recurrent exam without additional instruction
prior to the exam.  DOT replied that recurrent training must be completed and
documented at least once every two years, and that employees should receive
recurrent hazmat training before being tested .

Regarding questions about use of computer-based training to meet training
requirements, DOT said each agency must determine the most suitable source of
training for its employees.  Computer-based training is acceptable and may be
used provided the general awareness, function specific, safety training, and
testing requirements are fulfilled.

DOT added that a record of each hazmat employee's training over the preceding
two years must be maintained by the employer for the duration of employment
in each hazardous material job and for 90 days thereafter.  A current record
of relevant training is not required to be received from a previous employer,
but may be used to eliminate the need for the new employer to retrain as
required in 172.704 (c)(1)(iii).

Some asphalts in international transport are described differently than in

Some asphalts in international transport are described differently than in
domestic shipment, DOT informed Seneca Petroleum, Crestwood, Ill.  The
company asked about "cutback asphalts," which it said can be subdivided into
rapid curing, medium curing and slow curing.  It noted that the faster the
curing rate, the more volatile the material.

Seneca said its rapid curing asphalt has a flash point of 70 to 90 degrees
Fahrenheit.  Because it is transported at 150 degrees Fahrenheit, it believed
the product does not meet the definition of an elevated temperature material.
The company said it understood that elevated temperature materials are
defined in the HMR as liquids shipped above 212 degrees Fahrenheit or
materials shipped in a liquid phase with a flash point at or above 100
degrees Fahrenheit.

However, company safety director Jim Sniegowski said Illinois transportation
officials interpret the definition to mean any material transported at or
above its flash point.  Thus the state requires Seneca to prepare rapid
curing asphalt for shipment with elevated temperature shipping paper, marking
and placarding rules.  The firm asked for clarification of the elevated
temperature rule and for a proper shipping name.

DOT replied that a material with a flash point below 37.8 degrees Celsius
(100 degrees Fahrenheit) and offered for transportation or transported below
100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) does not meet the section 171.8
definition of an elevated temperature material.

Therefore, the shipping description for rapid curing asphalt would be
"Asphalt, cut-back, 3, UN1999, PG III," and elevated temperature rules would
not apply.  However, the agency added, for international transportation the
material must be described as "Elevated temperature liquid, flammable, n.o.s.
(Asphalt)."

A cap seal must withstand internal pressure of 100 kPa without the drum

A cap seal must withstand internal pressure of 100 kPa without the drum
closure in place, DOT advised Kelly Air Force Base, Texas.  The agency
covered sections 173.226 and 173.227 rules concerning closures on packagings
used to ship materials poisonous by inhalation.  The Air Force asked what
testing must be done to determine if a cap seal meets the internal pressure
requirements of the HMR.

DOT said no specific test (for example, hydrostatic testing) is required.
Whatever test is used, it must apply the pressure for enough time to
determine if the cap seal can withstand 100 kPa.  That period depends on the
test method used, the agency said.  It added that if a hydrostatic test is
used, for example, a five-minute application of the test pressure is
appropriate.

Adhesives shipped in containers weighing no more 66 pounds and marked in
accordance with HMR part 172 may be transported as a consumer commodity, DOT
told Grand Circuit, Freehold, N.J.  It sells an adhesive called Grand Circuit
Hoof Repair to blacksmiths for gluing on horseshoes and repairing damaged
hoof walls.

The product is sold "as is," ready for use off the shelf, explained general
manager Rita Newell.  Grand Circuit describes the material for shipping as a
flammable liquid, UN1133, class 3 in packing group III.  The adhesive is sold
in 1-, 2- and 3-ounce bot-tles, as well as in 40- and 380-mL plastic tubes.
The veterinary supply company asked for clarification of the ORM-D rating
when transporting its product.

DOT responded an "Adhesive, 3, UN1133, PG II," may be renamed and reclassed
as "Consumer commodity, ORM-D" if it meets criteria in 173.150.  That section
requires the materials not meet the definition of any other hazard class and
not be a hazardous substance, hazardous waste, or marine pollutant.

The agency advised that the inner packagings must be placed in a strong outer
packaging, the completed package must weigh no more than 66 pounds, and the
outer packaging must be marked in accordance with 172.316.

A material subject to EPA uniform hazardous waste manifest rules would be

A material subject to EPA uniform hazardous waste manifest rules would be
described as an "environmentally hazardous substance," DOT advised a Downers
Grove, Ill., firm.  Castrol Industrial described its product as a petroleum
oil, with a flash point of 400 degrees Fahrenheit and containing less than 5%
barium salt.  This material is packaged in 55-gallon (non-bulk) drums or 330-
gallon intermediate bulk containers.

The petroleum product maker noted that the material does not meet the
definition of a marine pollutant, but when tested as a waste, it does meet
EPA's definition of a toxic hazardous waste.  Company regulatory specialist
Marcia Montgomery asked whether a class 9 hazard warning label is appropriate
for shipping.

DOT replied that if the product is not a Division 6.1 poisonous material, a
marine pollutant, or a hazardous substance, then it does not meet the criter-
ia of any hazard class contained in 49 CFR Part 173 and, therefore, is not
subject to regulation.

However, if it is transported as a waste subject to EPA uniform hazardous
waste manifest rules, it would be described as "Waste, environmentally
hazardous substances, liquid, n.o.s., 9, UN 3082, PG III."  Packagings of 119
gallons or less (non-bulk) au-thorized for this material are in 173.203, DOT
said.  Packagings of greater than 119 gallons (bulk) are in 173.241.  In
addition, each bulk and non-bulk packaging must be marked in accordance with
sections 172.301 or 172.302, as applicable, and must be labeled with a Class
9 label as prescribed in section 172.400.

There are no restrictions on the number of inner receptacles in an outer

There are no restrictions on the number of inner receptacles in an outer
packaging as long as the complete package passes the prescribed tests and is
certified, DOT told Mallinckrodt Chemical, Paris, Ky.  Packaging engineer
Greg Smart asked the agency to clarify 173.158 pertaining to the number of
inner receptacles per outer package to ship nitric acid.  Subparagraph (b)(2)
limits the number of inner receptacles to four.  However, subparagraph (f)(2)
does not place a limit on the number of inner receptacles.

DOT advised that 173.158(f)(2) applies to nitric acid of 70% or less con-
centration.  When packaged in 4H1 expanded plastic boxes, the HMR does not
limit the number of inner glass packagings, only that each not exceed 2.5 L.

Paragraph (b)(2), which specifies a limit of four inner receptacles per outer
packaging applies to nitric acid in higher concentrations as long as it does
not contain sulfuric or hydrochloric acid as impurities.  In both cases, DOT
noted, outer packagings constructed of plastic also must conform to
compatibility requirements in 173.24(e).

A commercial invoice and packing list for export/import need not repeat
hazardous materials information on the ocean bill of lading, DOT told Lusk
Shipping, Baltimore.  The firm explained its commercial invoice includes a
description of goods, address of the shipper and seller and payment terms.
Lusk asked if emergency response information and phone numbers, as required
by the Hazardous Materials Regulations, needed to be included on the invoice
or material packing list.

DOT replied no.  The HMR specifies the shipping paper is the document that
contains the hazardous materials data required by sections 172.203 and 204
and emergency phone number required by 172.604(a)(3).  The agency added that
compliance with shipping paper data was met by the ocean bill of lading
containing all data required by sections 172.203, 172.204 and 172.604(a)(3).

Rules requiring manholes on cargo tank trucks apply to date of tank

Rules requiring manholes on cargo tank trucks apply to date of tank
manufacture, not vehicle manufacture, DOT said responding to carrier
inquiries on section 178.337-6, manhole closure requirements.  Several
companies noted manholes or inspection openings were mandated on cargo tanks
made after April 21, 1994, and that tanks made before that date but later
installed on trucks were not required to comply with the manhole rule.

DOT said the April 21 date applies to manufacture of the cargo tank, not its
installation on a motor vehicle.  It added that a cargo tank refers to the
tank fitted with all appurtenances, reinforcements, fittings and closures af-
fecting lading retention installed by the cargo tank manufacturer.

DOT said under the definition of cargo tank in 178.320, appurtenances,
fittings, closures and valves added by truck and tank assemblers or owners
are not part of a cargo tank.  Therefore, a tank marked with an original test
date on or before April 21, 1994, is not required to be fitted with manhole
or inspection openings.  The certificate stating the completed cargo tank
motor vehicle conforms to all DOT specifications and the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers code may be dated after April 21, 1994.
