         <BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>Obesity is a disorder with
         significant mortality and morbidity due to heart, joint or
         respiratory problems. The U.S. Department of Health and
         Human Services has estimated that 28% or 36 million of U.S.
         adults (20-74 years of age) are defined as obese and that
         effective prevention of obesity could save $50 billion
         annually in health care costs. Obesity drugs currently on
         the market are dependent on targeting the brain for their
         mode of action which is to suppress the appetite or
         accelerate the metabolism by amphetamine-like activity.
         While many of these drugs have demonstrated an ability to
         assist short-term weight loss, the long-term effects of
         their use have been less satisfactory as users tend to
         regain the weight initially lost ("bounce back
         effect")<A NAME="1"></A>. </FONT></P>

         <BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>The Company is developing a
         proprietary oral product for the treatment of obesity. Based
         on preliminary results from animal studies, the Company
         believes that the product's activity is not based on
         appetite suppression or on stimulating increased metabolic
         activity but on modification of the energy balance equation.
         This means that for the same amount of food intake, the body
         may store less fat in the presence of the product.
         Additionally, the product may also increase the amount of
         fat used to produce a given amount of energy. In animal
         studies conducted at Jackson Laboratories, genetically obese
         and diabetic mice were given the Company's proprietary
         product and were compared against a control group which was
         not given the product. Both groups ate the same amount of
         food. Test results showed that the mice that were given the
         product appeared normal (no longer obese) while the control
         group remained obese. </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>Under a Physician's IND, in a randomized,
         double-blind crossover study with 17 obese human subjects
         over a 20-week period, subjects lost significantly more
         weight when given the Company's obesity drug than during
         placebo administration, and preliminary results indicated
         that the subjects maintained such weight loss over an
         extended period (10 weeks). </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>The Company in 1994 completed under its own
         company-sponsored IND a Phase I tolerance and safety study
         that showed no adverse effects resulting from the obesity
         drug. The Company is augmenting significant existing animal
         and human data by sponsoring several additional animal
         studies and Phase I/II clinical human studies, as well as
         Phase II human studies with a less stringent dosing schedule
         for general obesity. SuperGen also is investigating RF 1051
         for related genetic diseases in which the major cause of
         morbidity and mortality is massive obesity. The drug
         currently is in Phase I/II human studies for Prader-Willi
         Syndrome, for which The Company has received Orphan Drug
         status.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
