<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>An Overview of Services</H1>



<HR>



<P>Schine On-Line Services, Inc., founded by cancer survivor <A HREF="gstory.html">Gary Schine</A>, gathers information on any and all types of cancer or other illness directly for clients.  Our researchers have extensive on-line experience and training from the National Library of Medicine and from other medical database providers.  We can search the databases for you and provide a report of the current developments and <A HREF="ctrials.html">clinical trials</A> for your particular illness.

<P>
<A NAME="legit"><CENTER><B>Are We Legitimate?</B></CENTER></A>

<P>People with cancer are particularly vulnerable to con men, snake oil salesmen, and well-intentioned practitioners of dubious therapies.  You are well advised to carefully check out any offer of treatment help before spending your money, or wasting time and effort on a useless therapeutic dead-end.
<P>Schine On-line Service is a legitimate company offering a legitimate services to persons with serious illness.  By all means check us out-- you don't have to take out word for it.  We belong to the <B>Better Business Bureau</B>.  That means that we have agreed to abide by a stringent code of business ethics as set forth by the BBB.  It also means that you can easily get information on our legitimacy from the BBB by calling 401-785-1212.  You will find our record to be unblemished.

<P>You can also check us out by reading about us in the following publications:
<UL>
<LI><I>Family Circle</I> (April 25, 1995)
<LI><I>Business Week</I> (February 20, 1995)
<LI><I>Men's Fitness</I> (June, 1995)
<LI><I>American Health</I> (June, 1995)
<LI><I>Chicago Tribune</I> (June 6, 1995)
</UL>
<P>Of course, Gary Schine's book <A HREF="garybook.html">Cancer Cure</A> details the rationale behind empowering yourself with information.
<P>We run an information service for people with cancer or other serious illness.  We believe that those facing illness need comprehensive and current  information on their treatment possibilities in order to make informed treatment decisions-- decisions that can literally involve life vs. death.  We believe that in some cases, the  information we provide  can  and does save lives.  However, we candidly admit that the information we provide may not lead to any changes in treatment and may serve to confirm that you are already getting the best that is available.

<P>If you are looking for comprehensive and very current treatment information specific to your illness, please call us!  If you are looking for promises of miracles, we unfortunately can not deliver.

<P>We hope to hear from you.
