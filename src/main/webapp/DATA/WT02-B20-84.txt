  This updated book provides a collection of longitudinal perspectives on 
experiences of individuals with Down Syndrome, from birth to adulthood.  The 
book is an outgrowth of a federally funded early intervention study called 
Project EDGE (Expanding Developmental Growth through Education).  Contents 
cover the following topics: historical review of developments regarding Down 
Syndrome (John Rynders), life as a journey (J.  Rynders), the new baby's life 
within the family, (Janet Sophie Thayer), health promotion during the early 
years (Margaret Horrobin), stimulation of the young child's development (J.  
Rynders), family adjustment and adaptation (Brian H. Abery), becoming literate 
and socialized during the school years (J.  Rynders), participating in 
community recreation (J.  Rynders et al.), the transition from school to work 
and independent living (Alan Fletcher), maintaining health into adulthood (M.  
Horrobin), perspectives of parents and siblings (J.  Rynders), and the life 
views of young adults with Down Syndrome (I.  Karon Sherarts).  Numerous 
photographs illustrate the personal accounts.  A resource compilation by 
Shannon Matson lists national organizations on Down Syndrome, assistive 
technology and communication aids, computers/technology resource centers, 
recreation resources, books, and journals.  Also appended are: information on 
reading skill stages, tips for adapting common recreation activities for young 
adults, and a list of assessment instruments and where they can be obtained.

  The purpose of this study was to describe the personal and professional 
changes that occurred when three young children with Down Syndrome were 
mainstreamed into "regular" kindergarten classes in Northeast Tennessee.  
During the 1989-1990 school year, data were collected using participant 
observation and in-depth interviews with parents, teachers, and principals in 
three schools.  Data were collapsed into four general categories of results, 
focusing on changes in personal and professional confidence, changes in 
teaching approaches and strategies, changes in perspectives on integration, and 
changes in personal beliefs and attitudes.  Results indicated that all adults 
 involved in the mainstreaming process viewed the experience positively.  All 
parties gained a great deal of confidence both in themselves and in each other. 
All those concerned developed a respect for the potential that children with 
Down Syndrome bring to the regular classroom.  (20 references) (JDD)<BR>

  The study compared the adjustment to regular classes (in New Zealand) of 
eight 6- and 7-year-old children with Down Syndrome (DS) with that of 24 
children rated by their eight teachers as being the "three least competent 
children in the class." The study evaluated teacher attitudes, social 
participation on the playground, and developmental progress.  The study found 
teachers still uncertain about the value of integrating such children into 
regular classes after 1 year though their beliefs were not always supported by 
the data comparing the DS children with the contrast children in the areas of 
time on-task/disruptions, interactions with the teacher, compliance, social 
interaction, and affectionate behavior and mimicry.  There was no support for 
the commonly held belief that DS children are socially isolated during 
unstructured time with some DS children showing a greater range of abilities 
when interacting with peers in unstructured situations than in the classroom.  
All of the DS children maintained or surpassed their previous rate of progress 
after 1 year although teachers gave them much more attention than contrast 
children.  Results suggested that integration of these children can be 
effective but that the services of an itinerant teacher are valuable and the 
use of novelty encourages more peer interaction in all children.  (DB)<BR>
