<UL>
<LI>The Fund participated in the strong stock market performance of the fourth quarter and the year.  Its return ranked it near the top third of its Lipper peers for 1996, with a return that was 1.4% higher than that of the average fund in the Equity Income Funds group.
<LI>The best performing sectors for the Fund during the fourth quarter were consumer staples, energy and finance.  Leading the way for consumer staples were the tobacco stocks that advanced on an improving environment regarding political litigation.  The energy group benefited from higher oil and gas prices, while our finance stocks fared well upon anticipation of stronger-than-expected fourth quarter earnings.
<LI>The Fund's fourth quarter performance trailed that of the S&amp;P 500 Index.  The major culprits were the Fund's consumer cyclicals, technology and health care stocks.  Retailers, who count on the holiday shopping season for most of their annual sales, reported only mediocre sales increases over 1995.  Even though we believe that our technology and health care stocks have promising long-term prospects, they produced modest returns during the quarter because of short-term concerns.
<LI>The fundamentals of the Fund continue to compare very favorably with the market indicating positive prospects going forward.  In addition, its long-term performance continues to be very competitive.

<B><I>Information presented is for the Fund's I Shares. Average annual total returns were 20.25%, 20.34%, 14.64% and 16.50% for the 1, 3, 5 years and since inception (3/31/89) periods, respectively, for the period ended 12/31/96. </I></B></I>

<P><I>
<B><I>These returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. During this period, some of the Fund's fees may have been waived; if these fees were not waived, total return would have been lower. Results represent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than original cost.</I></B></I>

<P><I>
<B><I>Prior to November 11, 1994, Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A. managed a collective trust fund with investment objectives and policies substantially the same as those of the Fund. The performance for the Fund includes the performance of the predecessor collective investment fund for periods before it became a mutual fund on November 11, 1994. The collective investment fund performance was adjusted to reflect the Fund's 1994 estimate of its expense ratio for the first year of operations as a mutual fund. The collective investment fund was not registered under the 1940 Act or subject to certain investment restrictions that are imposed by the Act. If the collective investment fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the collective investment fund historical return may have been adversely affected.  Distributed by Forum Financial Services, Inc. Mutual Funds are not FDIC OR FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD INSURED AND MAY LOSE VALUE.  NO BANK GUARANTEE.</I></B></I>
