<H2>Use</H2>

<P>

Hydrogen's potential use as a fuel and an energy carrier includes 
powering 

vehicles, running turbines or fuel cells to produce electricity, and 
cogenerating heat 

and electricity for buildings.  Research in hydrogen utilization is 
focused on 

technologies that will most directly facilitate the progression to a 
hydrogen energy 

economy.  These include fuel cells, internal combustion engines, and 
hydrogen 

burners.

<P>

Using hydrogen and hydrogen-natural gas mixtures as transportation fuels 

is 

a sustainable, environmentally friendly alternative to filling our fuel 
tanks with 

imported petroleum.  To introduce hydrogen successfully into the 
transportation fuel 

market, researchers are developing efficient, reliable transportation 
systems that 

run on hydrogen.  We begin by developing hydrogen-burning internal 
combustion 

engines with high brake thermal efficiencies and low emissions; the 
development of 

advanced fuel cells; and by addressing important safety issues.  For 
more 

information about DOE-sponsored research and development in the use of 

hydrogen, select any of these main topics:
