<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Outsourcing Your Employee Benefits:  Pension and Health
Care</STRONG></FONT><P>


"I felt like a rat caught in a maze," Frank recalled with a chuckle.  He had retired last
year after three
decades of loyal service with the same company.  His benefit records haven't been right
since.  <P>

According to Frank's own notes, he was once transferred six times during a single phone call.
. . after
which he was disconnected.  He was told twice that there was no record of him on file; once
that he was
deceased; and more than a dozen times that never-received forms were about to be -- or
already had
been -- mailed to him.<P>

Sound familiar?  The pension, health and other benefit programs for some companies are often
like
Frank's maze.  Thanks to a do-it-yourself patchwork design, even routine administrative tasks
- such as
a marital name change or change of address - can involve days of telephone tag, followed by
months of
straightening out incorrect and incomplete records. <P>

That's just one reason thousands of companies have begun "outsourcing" their benefits
services to
specialists such as New York Life Benefit Services Company.  Since 1970, New York Life Benefit
Services
Company has been providing consulting, actuarial, administrative and communication services
in the
field of employee benefits, retirement plans and related areas.<P>

Outsourcing, as the name implies, moves all or many aspects of your
company's benefit supervision to a benefit services company that focuses on providing just
those
services.  They do what they do best, and allow you to do the same.  <P>

Outsourcing businesses have found that plan participants can update records for such "life
events" as
marriage, divorce, sick leave, return to work, birth or death in the family and retirement,
in a few minutes.
. . often with just one toll-free telephone call.  <P>

They also receive convenient, one-stop service for their total benefit packages.  Just as
important, they
have found that they can now dedicate all their resources to their own core business
activities, and not
have to focus on benefit services.<P>

What types of services can you obtain from an outsourcing firm such as New York Life Benefit
Services
Company?  <P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
		<LI><STRONG>Underwriting analysis and plan design. </STRONG> A full-service approach
to outsourcing

services as 
		valuations and calculation, as well as participant tracking and database management, 
termination processing, preparation and filing of government reports, trust services 	and
management, benefit payment and disbursement monitoring.<P>

		<LI><STRONG>Investment services for retirement packages</STRONG>.  These include not
only New 
		York Life investment options, but also a full spectrum of mutual funds from other 
		leading fund families.<P>
	
		<LI><STRONG>Participant communications.</STRONG> A quality outsource vendor helps
you "sell" your 
		benefits packages through custom video programs, information handbooks, 
		personalized benefit statements, newsletters and other support materials.
	<P>
</UL>

<OL TYPE=1 START="1">

them.

	<LI>Is the company committed to investing in technology?  
	<LI>Benefit services is technologically driven.  The firm's expertise in this area, as
well as its
commitment to investing in technology, are key factors in cost savings and responsive service.

	<LI>What is the company's attitude toward its own people?  A positive corporate culture
is a good indication of the type of customer service your employees will
experience.

	<LI>Are they committed to their own employees' ongoing training?

	<LI>Do they treat their clients as partners and not just as customers?

	<LI>Do they demonstrate a strong commitment to service?

	<LI>Are they experienced in the benefit services field?  It takes years of industry
involvement to
develop the necessary expertise.
