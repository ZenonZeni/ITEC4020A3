<H3>The new McClean Lake/Midwest Uranium Project. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/poissbio.html">Michel Poissonnet</A>.</H3>



COGEMA Resources Inc. and its partners are developing the McClean Lake Project, located in
northern Saskatchewan in the eastern Athabasca Sandstone Basin, 750 km north of Saskatoon.
It comprises five uranium deposits: JEB to the north, Sue A, Sue B and Sue C in the south, and
McClean to the west. The mineral leases contain around 20 000tU (50 million pounds equivalent
U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB></SMALL>O<SUB><SMALL>8</SUB></SMALL>). The project history and ownership are outlined, plus the connection with the Midwest
Project, whose deposit lies 15 km west of McClean and contains around 360 000 tonnes of 3.8%
uranium ore, (13 700 tU or 35 million pounds equivalent U<SMALL><SUB>3</SMALL></SUB>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB>). COGEMA is regarded as the
operator of both projects.  

<P>
The environmental review processes for the projects are under way; the Midwest Project is not
yet approved but approval is expected in early 1997. Construction and production activities will
start at the JEB deposit and include the main access road; waste and ore storage pads and water
containment ponds; the water treatment plant with water and sludge ponds; the office and
maintenance shop; electrical sub-station and distribution network; and the groundwater
interceptor wells ringing the JEB pit. Stripping of the overburden will follow, then waste rock
mining, and ultimately ore mining by end 1996. Construction of the processing plant will
proceed simultaneously. The mined out JEB pit will become a tailings depository in 1997, and
mining activity will move to Sue C (1998-2002); Sue A and B (2003-2005); Midwest (2003-
2009); and the McClean underground mine (from 2009).

<P>
Innovative technical features which make McClean and Midwest Projects a technological
showcase for COGEMA are the jet boring mining method at Midwest, which breaks up
previously frozen ore with a high pressure water jet; the design of the McClean mill, which is
based on conceptual risk analysis and also on use of two-storey buildings, the personnel on the
second floor being separated from the ore on the first floor by a thick concrete floor; and the JEB
pit and tailings management facility, which uses a ring of 30 dewatering wells to intercept and
remove groundwater before mining - this reduces chemical loading to the environment and
creates drier mining conditions.

<P>
COGEMA's commitment to local people is demonstrated by its continuing to fill almost 60% of
permanent positions at Cluff Lake mine with residents of Saskatchewan s North. A similar
committment has been applied to the new mines and a  Multi-Party Training Agreement , signed
and funded by industry and governments, anticipates employee requirements for the future while
many contracts for construction activities and services have been awarded to local businesses.
COGEMA's Human Resources Agreement with the Prince Albert Development Corporation,
the business arm of the Prince Albert Tribal Council, facilitates hiring of northerners to
McClean.
