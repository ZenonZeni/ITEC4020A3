<IMG ALIGN="left" ALT="S" SRC="sceleb.gif">haron Lawrence may be a three-time Emmy Award nominee now, but it all began for her as a one-shot deal on "NYPD Blue."  The actress was hired to work a single day opposite Dennis Franz.  So compelling was Lawrence that she's been  "Blue" ever since.  In fact, Sylvia Costas, the very human Assistant D.A., wife of beleaguered cop Andy Sipowicz (Franz), and mother of their child, is one of the show's most popular characters.  The North Carolina-born, theater-trained actress has wisely</TD><TD VALIGN="top"> capitalized on the opportunities "Blue" presented her, performing in several popular TV movies.  Most memorably, however, Lawrence mercilessly chewed the scenery in a "Caroline in the City" guest stint, and that paved the way for her starring role in "Fired Up," an NBC mid-season replacement that's generating quite a buzz.  Here, SMOKE catches up with the vibrant, chatty Lawrence before she embarks on the double-duty task of acting in both "NYPD Blue" and "Fired Up." </TD></TR></TABLE>
