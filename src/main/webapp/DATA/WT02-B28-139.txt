<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Modified Premium Whole Life</STRONG></FONT><P>

Modified Premium Whole Life (MPWL) is a permanent, participating life insurance
policy that
features a
lower initial premium that remains level for the policy's first five years, then
increases to
its ultimate
premium in year six, and remains at that level for life. It is best suited for
established
individuals
seeking a large amount of insurance and moderate cash value accumulation at a
reduced
premium.  
<P>

<STRONG>Uses of MPWL</STRONG><BR>
Individual - MPWL can be an effective method of protecting your family's assets.
Some
potential uses
include:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI><STRONG>Traditional Insurance Protection</STRONG> - Provides the
financial
security
that
gives families the
peace of mind they deserve.
	<LI><STRONG>Mortgage Protection</STRONG> - Can help pay off mortgages and
other
outstanding
debts in the event
of a premature death.
	<LI><STRONG>Retirement Funding</STRONG> - Over the long-term, accumulated
cash
value can
be accessed through
policy loans to help fund a comfortable retirement.
	<LI><STRONG>Education Funding</STRONG> - Can help pay for children's and
grandchildren's
education through
policy loans, or as named beneficiaries.
	<LI><STRONG>Pension Maximization</STRONG> - A possible solution to the
pension
dilemma,
whereby a "single-life"
pension option is chosen and life insurance proceeds are earmarked to replace the
lost
pension
benefit in the event of pensioner's death.
	<LI><STRONG>Estate Planning Tool</STRONG> - Can be an effective way of
providing funds
for
estate expenses, and
helping to avoid the sale of assets and/or the need to borrow. 
	<LI><STRONG>Charitable Giving</STRONG> - Bequesting life insurance to make a
larger
donation
to your favorite
charity.
</UL>
<P>
Business - MPWL can play many vital roles in the smooth operation of a business. It
can be
used as
an attractive employee benefit, and as a means to assure the business's financial
future.
Below are
some examples of its use:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><STRONG>Split Dollar Arrangement </STRONG>- Employee is covered by an
insurance
policy
while premiums are
paid by the employer. The employer owns the policy, but the employee can name the
beneficiary. Upon
the death of the employee, the employer receives proceeds equal to the cash value
of the
policy, while
the beneficiary receives the remaining proceeds.
	<LI><STRONG>Group Equity Carve Out</STRONG> - Offers employers the
opportunity
to
provide
permanent, cash value
life insurance to select employees, while keeping the costs low.
	<LI><STRONG>Deferred Compensation</STRONG> - Offers employers the
opportunity
to provide
benefits to employees
at a later date, such as at retirement.
	<LI><STRONG>Salary Continuation</STRONG> - Offers employees supplemental
retirement and
death benefits.
	<LI><STRONG>Buy/Sell Agreement </STRONG>- Funding a buy/sell agreement
through
life
insurance can be the smart
choice for protecting your business's assets.
