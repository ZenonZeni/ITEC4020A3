<P>
Whether you are evaluating a new fund or keeping
track of one you presently own, you'll need to measure the fund's
performance. Since funds may invest for current income, long-term
growth or a combination of both, there are three ways to track
performance and judge how well a fund has done:

<UL>
<LI><B>NAV Change</B>
--- a fund's share price is the dollar value of one share of the
fund and is determined by dividing the current value of the fund
by the number of shares currently outstanding. The NAV increases
when the value of the holdings increase. For example, if one share
of XYZ fund costs $15 today and cost $10 a year ago, then there has
been a profit (or capital gain) of $5 per share.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Yield</B>
--- measures the amount of income a fund provides as a percentage
of its current price or NAV. For example, if ACME long-term bond
fund has a NAV of $10 and is paying a dividend of $.60 per share,
the yield on the fund would be 6.00% ($.60 &#247; $10 = 6.00%).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
 <UL>
<LI><B>Total Return</B>
--- measures how much income a fund has made and how much money
a fund has made or lost over time. It's defined as the percentage
change in the purchase price (NAV) including any distribution
(income and/or capital gains) that have been paid. In addition,
any sales charges that have been made must be added into the initial
purchase price. For example, if you purchased a fund for $10 a
year ago that is now selling for $12 and received a $2 distribution,
the total return would be 40% ($2 distribution + $2 price appreciation
= $4 gain on your original investment).</LI>   
</UL>
<P>
You can evaluate a fund in relation to other
ways you could have invested such as stocks or bonds, but since
return is calculated differently for each type of investment,
there isn't a simple formula for comparing mutual funds to individual
securities. It's like comparing apples to oranges. One way investors
can measure a fund's performance is to compare its return against
a major market index that reports on the same kind of investments
the fund makes.

<P>
For example, a gain or loss in a general stock
fund could be compared to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock
Index and a bond fund could be compared to a government/corporate
bond index. However, index figures do not include reinvested dividends,
interest or transaction costs, so they can't be compared directly
to total return figures. Another method to evaluate a fund's performance
is to compare its performance with other funds that have the same
objective or to industry benchmarks provided by such companies
as <I>Lipper Analytical Services </I>and <I>Morningstar, Inc.</I>
