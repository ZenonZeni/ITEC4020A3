<H2>Pulsatile GnRH Administration</H2>

<P>
Infertility patients who are not ovulating may be treated with
subcutaneous or intravenous administration of GnRH (Gonadotropin
Releasing Hormone). The purpose of this drug is to induce ovulation.
<P>
<B>Description<BR>
</B>GnRH is administered either subcutaneously (a small needle
inserted into the abdomen) or intravenously (a small needle inserted
into a vein in the arm). The needle is attached to a long plastic
tubing which attaches to a syringe inserted in a pump. Multiple
doses of the drug are injected by use of a battery-powered infusion
pump. The pump is set to administer a set dosage of GnRH every
90 minutes. The pump will make a small noise when each dose is
given. The pump is worn during the entire period of drug administration.
This period of time usually begins on day 3 of your menstrual
cycle and ends at the time you ovulate.
<P>
<B>Procedure<BR>
</B>1. You will need an ultrasound appointment on the day of pump
insertion (the third day of your menstrual cycle). This is necessary
to check that your ovaries are normal size. This appointment is
made by calling Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre at 265-3662.
All pump appointments are scheduled between 7:30 and 9:30 a.m.
<P>
2. At this appointment, the doctor will begin the GnRH therapy
by inserting the needle and setting the proper dosage of GnRH
for you.
<P>
3. You will have to return to our office to have the pump refilled.
This is usually 7 days. During these visits, the doctor will check
the needle site to make sure it is working properly and that there
are no signs of infection. You will need to return more frequently
to have the needle changed if there is any redness or soreness
surrounding the site.
<P>
4. Beginning approximately Day 10 of your cycle, you will need
to be scheduled for ultrasounds during your visits. This is done
to monitor the growth of your follicle and to determine the time
of ovulation. You may also have a blood test for estradiol - a
hormone in your blood that rises as ovulation time nears. We will
schedule repeat ultrasound examinations and estradiol levels will
be tested depending upon how rapidly your follicle is growing
and how high your estradiol levels are.
<P>
5. When it has been determined by an LH surge and ultrasound that
you have ovulated, the pump will be discontinued. You will return
to the office every three to four days for injections of a drug
called hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) which is given to maintain
proper hormone levels to support a pregnancy. If you do not ovulate
spontaneously, we may give you an injection of hCG to induce ovulation.
This is done when you have a follicle that is large enough to
ovulate (about 20 mm. in diameter).
<P>
<B>CARE OF THE PUMP<BR>
</B>1. The pump is an expensive piece of equipment and must be
treated carefully.
<P>
2. Pumps can be carried in your pocket or worn strapped to the
waist with a narrow belt. If you strap it to your waist, you are
less likely to forget that it is there and you are less likely
to drop it accidentally.
<P>
3. During sleep, the pump can be set on a bedside stand or strapped
to the bed with a belt. Do not forget to take it with you if you
get up during the night!
<P>
4. We do not recommend tub baths, swimming or other water sports
while the pump is in, <I>especially</I> if the needle is inserted
in the abdomen. If you do not have a shower, keep the water level
in the tub below the injection sight or sponge bathe at the sink.
When showering, the pump can be hung from the shower rod or shower
head encased in a plastic bag. Otherwise, you can place it on
a stool outside the shower curtain. The important thing is to
<B>keep the pump dry at all times</B>.
<P>
5. The plastic tubing attached to the pump will be securely taped
down at the time the pump is started. This tubing will not collapse
if pressure is applied to it. Be careful around pets and children,
however, because the tubing can come apart.
<P>
6. Check the needle site every day, looking for bleeding, redness,
soreness, or drainage. If any of these symptoms appear, make an
appointment for a pump check by calling the office at 265-3662.
