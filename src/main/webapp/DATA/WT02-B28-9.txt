<P><I><TT>The law on negligence plays a great part in governing how patients'
refusals of treatment are handled. Chris Docker suggests it is need of
overhaul... (Note: this article has been slightly shortened from its original
formats. Comments are welcomed to the author at vess@euthanasia.org.)</TT></I></P>

<P><B>Introduction</B></P>

<P>What I shall attempt to argue in this paper is that negligence has developed
an overloaded framework that disguises bad law, and I will suggest that,
if the evolution of the common law fails to mutate the tort of negligence
to accommodate changing needs within modern society, then statutory adjustment
may be desirable. Would that statutory embodiment should prove unnecessary
but, unless the necessary reform can be achieved within the current system,
some such shake up may be necessary.</P>

<P>Antiquated law[1] is attempting to deal with the technology explosion
of the last fifty years and the attendant need for information and ethical
awareness. Non-medical problems, that are more a question of ethics or
resources, are being treated as if they were medical. The tests which the
law attempts to apply (e.g. &quot;Bolam&quot;[2], best interests[3]) are
controversial and in need of overhaul. I will argue that one of the best
ways to tackle an accessible part of this problem would be to separate
out ethical from purely medical concerns.</P>

<P>Medical negligence occasions vast expenditure from the public purse,
yet there is low confidence that it attains the degree of justice that
it should.[4] It is estimated that the sorely pressed NHS[5] spent upward
of &pound;45m on medical negligence claims in 1990.[6] There is no doubt
that most of these claims were time-consuming, expensive and potentially
destructive, many of them bettering neither patient or doctor.[7] The figure
had risen to &pound;150m by 1995[8] and looks set for further increase.[9]
These costs are a considerable drain on healthcare and, even though there
is still much debate over whether costs can be sensibly reduced, it is
important that we also look at how those costs are distributed and whether
such distribution can be achieved more fairly. Negligence does not simply
cover applying medical technique badly, it includes failing to give appropriate
information to a patient before obtaining consent,[10] and it is to this
latter category[11] that I particularly wish to turn.[12] It is different
from medical diagnosis and treatment inasmuch as it a more distinctly ethical,
rather than medical, issue. With increasing technology[13], it is an area
that will assume increased importance, not less, as we approach the next
century. There may be little reason to suggest that a patient should not
benefit from more appropriate expertise in these matters, simply because
it is not readily available under the present system.</P>

<P>There have, of course been many proposals and attempts to overhauling
the whole of the tort of medical negligence,[14] adopting a &quot;no-fault&quot;
system, or implementing many less drastic changes across the board, such
us with the very recent paper of Lord Woolf.[15] Unfortunately, although
a tort of negligence may be an imperfect means of compensating for wrong,[16]
other options may be even less desirable,[17] and some of the supposed
advantages of alternate systems have not been borne out by practice.[18]
The debate is clouded by popular beliefs: although some claims are undoubtedly
ill-advised[19] and patients are becoming more inclined to go to court,
there is evidence, for instance, that too few, rather than too many, claims
result in a successful action.[20] What needs to be done is to separate
out the groups of wrongs currently handled as negligence and build more
appropriate procedures and standards to assess them. Recent steps to promote
mediation,[21] for instance, or augment the powers of the General Medical
Council,[22] or modifying judicial procedures,[23] tackle specific aspects
in relative isolation and can be thought of as improvements to the present
system[24] that may reap lesser or greater rewards (and may themselves
also need further refinement). These smaller, specific measures have the
great advantage of being implementable rather than major, sweeping alterations,
that not only might fail from using too large a brush but from the lack
of parliamentary time needed for proper debate of such extensive bills.[25]</P>

<P>It is one thing to acknowledge that doctors may lack ethical expertise,
even if they are, with beneficent intentions, often capable of disguising
moral decisions as clinical judgements; (this need not infer moral culpability
on the doctor: someone whose training is overwhelmingly concerned with
the diagnosis and treatment of organic illness cannot easily acquire or
display the conceptual and interpersonal skills that a truly informed consent[26]
demands.[27]) it is then quite another thing to demand that they suddenly
acquire that expertise,[28] and perhaps not even entirely reasonable: we
encourage nurses to acquire proficiency in many areas of medicine for instance,
but we don't expect them to double up as doctors. There are times when
a doctor will practice better medicine from an awareness of medical ethics,
but that does not make her an ethicist - in fact there might even be a
conflict of interests between the two roles. I am thinking of a nurse or
ethicist particularly as a patient advocate[29], concentrating on patient
values that may seem at odds with priorities of diagnosis, treatment and
resource allocation. Of course, often the courts will encompass this role,
but it could be argued that this could, in some instances, merely be exchanging
medical paternalism for legal paternalism.</P>

<P>As these areas are non-medical ones, strictly speaking, we might argue
that in some instances, such as information-giving and withdrawal of treatment
decisions, the tort of negligence should be patient-centred rather than
medical team -centred.</P>

<P>It is perhaps the point made by Lord Mustill when he ventured:</P>

<H5>...I venture to feel some reservations about the application of the
principle of civil liability in negligence laid down in Bolam v. Friern
Hospital Management Committee... I accept without difficulty that this
principle applies to the ascertainment of the medical raw material such
as diagnosis, prognosis and appraisal of the patient's cognitive functions.[30]
Beyond this point, however, it may be said that the decision is ethical,
not medical, and that there is no reason in logic why on such a decision
the opinions of doctors should be decisive.[31]</H5>

<P>Yet the British courts have long retained the emphasis on doctors' duty
in questions of information disclosure, as Professor McLean pointed out
in her seminal work on the subject,[32] and they have done so possibly
at the expense of emphasising what Lord Scarman in <I>Sidaway[33] </I>called
&quot;a basic human right&quot; relating to the right to make one's own
decisions - and the fact that &quot;the doctor's duty arises from his patient's
rights&quot; not vice versa. The courts' protection of human rights is
more basic and far-reaching than the handling of medical scenarios and
so its significance is not to be underestimated.[34]</P>

<P>A danger of medicalisation of the law becomes apparent, for instance,
in the inconsistencies of judgements such as that of Lord Browne-Wilkinson,
who, whilst advocating a prudent patient position in <I>Sidaway[35] </I>makes
the error of calling information &quot;advice&quot; when he lumps together
&quot;diagnosis, advice and treatment.&quot;[36] The typical bias is thus
introduced: doctors presenting information in the way that they would persuade
the patient. This further tips the scales in what is already an uneven
balance; as Freidson observed:</P>

<H5>It is my impression that clients are more often bullied than informed
into consent, their resistance weakened in part by their desire for the
general service if not the specific procedure, in part by the oppressive
setting they find themselves in, and in part by the calculated intimidation,
restriction of information, and covert threats of rejection by the professional
staff itself.[39]</H5>

<P>Bias, if any,[40] should actually, be that of the patient. Some attempts
to enhance this have met with little success against a backdrop of medical
paternalism or bureaucratic lethargy. Much is talked about informed consent,
but it remains, in practice, little more than a quasi-ethical platitude.[41]
Not only is informed consent a concept that has no formal standing in British
law,[42] but consent is frequently obtained, quite legally, without the
disclosure of information that is ethically required for such consent to
be valid. Lord Donaldson, in his historic judgement in <I>Re T, </I>suggested
that forms[43] used for patient refusal and consent could enhance patient
awareness[44] of possible consequences by &quot;different and larger typeface,
by underlining, the employment of colour print or otherwise.[45] Yet the
Department of Health came up with little improvement other than window
dressing and &quot;added verbiage&quot;.[46] In a more constructive vein,
the Law Society in conjunction with the BMA more recently came up with
arguments about 'enhancing capacity': &quot;Doctors should be aware both
that medical disabilities can fluctuate and that there are many factors
extraneous to a person's medical disorder which may adversely influence
capacity. It is the duty of the assessing doctor to maximise capacity&quot;[47]
They suggest that capacity can be enhanced as much as possible by treating
secondary symptoms, by carefully considering the time and place for vital
communication, third party considerations, and a suitable time scale and
supportive framework for digesting the information before a decision is
required.[48] Competence to consent is as important as the information
on which to make a decision about consent or refusal. Some of these simple,
very human approaches[49] can be seen in the better pre-natal clinics,
particularly for pregnant women contemplating the possibility of a child
with Downs syndrome; but even in this area facilities vary widely across
the country and are sometimes non-existent.[50]</P>

<P>The notion of informed consent probably grew out of the concern for
research subjects and a perceived need to minimize the potential for harm,[51]
but as it became reinforced with the growth of, and demand for, patients'
&quot;rights&quot;,[52] it may have taken on a mantle which it can ill-support.</P>

<H5>Without much exaggeration it can be said that all of medical ethics
is but a footnote to informed consent. It is the concept that first called
medicine out of its paternalistic slumber and into the open light of public
scrutiny. Informed consent serves as the foundation upon which answers
to new questions and problems are constructed. Informed consent is a kind
of doctrine, that is, an amalgam of legal and philosophical reasoning with
a conceptual framework and a number of specific prescriptions. This framework
entails a few basic actions and presupposes certain conditions. At the
heart of the doctrine is the legal principle that &quot;the right of a
competent person to refuse medical treatment is virtually absolute.&quot;
The exercise of this right presupposes that the patient must receive all
information relevant to the decision to undergo or forgo a proposed treatment
and that he or she must comprehend the information. The legal principle
indicates that the patient needs to be competent and it is relatively freely
made. Although influence is acceptable, all forms of coercion are beyond
the pale.[53]</H5>

<P>We can go on to look at the limitations of the doctrine with a view
to refining it, but that process cannot effectively start until we address
the basic anomaly of the law in Bolam, that makes one person (the patient)
the apparent decisionmaker, and another person (the doctor acting in accordance
with an accepted body of medical opinion) the ultimate arbiter of that
very information needed to make the decision.[54] In other words, developmental
progress for patient advocacy, or reconceiving the contextual basis of
autonomy (as examined by Hardwig[55] and Kuczewski[56] and others) will
be wasted effort until the fundamental loophole is corrected. One cannot
improve on, or enhance patient autonomy, if the very basis for that autonomy
is effectively denied by simplistic application of common law.</P>

<P>There has been some hope that the common law would gradually come to
refine its use of the Bolam test, using it, quite reasonably it might be
argued, as a benchmark for assessing negligence in matters of medical technique,
and avoiding it for cases of information disclosure. Sadly the practice
has been dilatory to say the least.</P>

<P><I>Bolam </I>was cited, for instance to justify an action against a
surgeon who failed to warn a patient that an operation to treat rectal
prolapse might mean that the 28 year old man would be unable to have sexual
intercourse. The fact that the case was won for the plaintiff, arguably
by such misappropriated case law, did little to establish patients' rights
on a more secure footing.[57]</P>

<P>One might suggest that emphasis on rights rather than duties is hair-splitting,
but the practical implementation demonstrates a more marked difference.
In many cases, effective assertion of patients' rights requires advocacy
- someone to be there in the patient's corner. Many patients entering hospital
will seem to be &quot;capable&quot;, but the reality is that their effective
assertiveness may be limited by disease or injury and the attendant stress
and worry, not to mention the business-like atmosphere encouraging him
to &quot;do as he's told&quot; as he lies helpless in a hospital bed. Psychologically,
the dice are weighted against the patient. It seems no small coincidence
that in the currently popular vogue for &quot;living wills&quot; or &quot;advance
medical directives&quot; the only well known instances where these documents
have been or would have been followed are where there was a patient advocate
- either in the form of a determined relative[58 ]or in the form of the
courts.[59]</P>

<P>It would be too easy to say that the role of patient advocate should
be taken on more formally by nurses. Although there is a place for this,
greater formalisation could lead to greater conflict between nursing and
medical professions, possibly within the same healthcare team.[61] Ad hoc
arrangements might work - we are generally looking at the careful application
of basic human qualities of communication that may be overlooked or overstretched
in a professional setting. But the importance of informed consent is so
great that more secure provision should perhaps be made. A statutory duty
on health care facilities to provide a surrogate patient advocate[62] where
none was available would better serve this end. The level of skill required
should be commensurate with the dilemmas likely to be faced, but there
might be an increased role for a hospital ethicist, perhaps even with professional
liability.[63] Such a system, particularly in the current arrangement of
NHS trusts, might also go some way to standardising negligence claims,
reducing costs both by easing the identification of liability and by reducing
the incidence of information-disclosure negligence. NHS Trusts might make
savings on the latter count, but even if ease of access to litigation resulted
in the savings being absorbed, a more equitable system would have at least
seen national resources better spent.</P>

<P>The basics of negligence should be retained - duty of care - breach
of that duty - resultant damage. Merely the reliance on the Bolam test
should be changed. So, in <I>Goorkani v. Tayside Health Board (O.H.) [1991]
SLT 94, </I>the result would probably be the same, as it seems Mr Goorkani
would have chosen the same treatment, even if he had been informed about
the risk of infertility, in order to preserve his eyesight. However, in
<I>Gold v. Haringey Health Authority [1987] 2 All ER,64 </I>the result
would probably have been the opposite, as the appeal court, relying heavily
on <I>Bolam, </I>overturned the lower court's decision to award damages
in negligence to a woman who had undergone a sterilisation to avoid further
pregnancy, without sufficient warning from the physician of the failure
rate of the operation, and without being given information about the alternative
of a vasectomy for her husband. In allowing the appeal, Brown LJ also drew
selectively on Sidaway, agreeing with Lord Dipcock's rather simplistic
view that the general duty of a doctor is &quot;not subject to dissection
into a number of component parts to which different criteria of what satisfy
the duty of care apply.&quot; This decision is cognate with similar reasonings
in <I>Blyth v. Bloomsbury Health Authority [1993] 4 Med LR 151 (CA) </I>and,
in Scotland, in <I>Moyes v Lothian Health Board [1990] SLT 444 1 Med LR
463.</I></P>

<P>The legal change should be supported by social and other measures to
enhance capacity and increase patient advocacy. Social changes that are
not supported by a fundamental shift in the law relating to standards of
information giving could result in forms, promises and guidelines that
are not worth the paper they are written on. As West expressed it:</P>

<P>The entire process will be for naught if all we accomplish is to change
the old saw from &quot;The operation was a success, but the patient died,&quot;
to &quot;The patient died, but his physician stayed within the practice
guideline.&quot;65</P>

<P><B>Summary</B></P>

<P>If there is not a reversal of common law trends to follow the Bolam
principle in deciding claims for medical negligence where information disclosure
is at issue, then statutory or declaratory guidance should be devised.
When patient autonomy has been thus enabled by adequate information, it
should be enhanced and protected by such measures as availability of patient
advocates of various types to give varying categories of support, independent
of the medical staff if necessary.</P>

action of the case, and like all derivatives of case, it is actionable
only on proof of damage, i.e. not per se. However, the modern tort of negligence,
arising from breach by the defendant of a legal duty of care owed by him
to the plaintiff, takes its origin from the early nineteenth century. Since
then it has developed in &quot;disconnected slabs&quot; - Candler v Crane
Christmas &amp; Co (1951) - so that even today it exhibits little generality.&quot;
Tyas J.G.M., Law of Torts, 2nd edition, Macdonald and Evans 1973:58. Ibid:
&quot;It has also been said that negligence 'properly connotes the complex
concept of duty, breach and damage thereby suffered by the person to whom
the duty was owing': Lochgelly Iron Works &amp; Coal Co. v. M'Mullan (1934),
per Lord Wright. This is the modern definition.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>2.The so-called &quot;Bolam&quot; test, based on the case
of Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 1 WLR 582, indicates
that a doctor is not negligent if he or she acts in accordance with a school
of thought accepted at the time as reasonable by a responsible body of
medical opinion, even though other doctors adopt a different practice.
This has been the subject of common law debates in many jurisdictions (some
of which have rejected it altogether) and also within the UK, for instance,
when the judges in Sidaway v. Governers of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and
Maudsley Hospital and Others [1985] 1 All ER 643 (HL) had considerable
differences of opinion on it. A detailed discussion occurs in McLean S.,
A Patient's Right to Know - Information Disclosure, the Doctor and the
Law. Hants: Dartmouth 1989:104-122. Classic alternative doctrine to the
Bolam test is presented in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals
case of Canterbury v. Spence 464 F 2d 772 (DC, 1972); and the Canadian
case of Haughian v Paine [1987] 37 DLR (4th) 624 (Sask CA), for instance,
illustrates that the doctor's duty should extend not only to disclosing
all relevant risks but also, in principle, to alternative forms of treatment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>3.The concept of &quot;best interests&quot; was subject
to some overhaul by the Law Commission, but their proposals have not been
passed into law (Law Com No 231, Mental Incapacity, London:HMSO 1995:44-48).
Problems with the standard are discussed in Docker C., &quot;Limitations
of the 'Best Interests' and 'Substituted Judgement' standards&quot; Dying
In Dignity Mensa Sig News Journal 1996;3(1):9-15 (previously submitted
in the Ethics Module for M.Phil 1996). A glimpse of the problem can be
seen in Veatch: &quot;For a clinician to guess at what is the best course
for the patient, three assumptions must be true regarding a theory of the
good. First, the clinician must be expected to determine what will best
serve the patient's medical or health interest; second, the clinician must
be expected to determine how to trade off health interests with other interests;
and third, the clinician must be expected to determine how the patient
should relate the pursuit of her best interest to other moral goals and
responsibilities, including serving the interests of others and fulfilling
any moral duties she may have that happen to conflict with her interest.&quot;

the NHS to fulfil its original mandate of providing a comprehensive free

at just over 7% of GDP, is among the lowest in Europe, largely because
less is spent privately in Britain than in other European countries. America
spends a hefty 14% of GDP on health.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>6. &quot;There is no shortage of evidence that claims
against doctors in the United Kingdom for professional negligence have
increased markedly over the last decade. The cost of this is considerable:

and &quot;condone&quot;. For an examination of some radically different

litigation should be as level as possible,' he says. 'There are often cases,
medical negligence for example, where the plaintiff cannot afford a trial
involving multiple expert witnesses duplicating the same work. In that
sort of situation, the procedural judge would have a very significant decision
to make. He would have to decide whether the plaintiff is right and the
case could produce a reasonably just result in the way he proposes. The
alternative would be to do it in a much more elaborate way. The judge will
say to the defendant who has much more substantial means, &quot;If you
want to do it in that more elaborate way, you've got to pay (even if you
win) the difference between doing it on an affordable basis and doing it
on an unnaffordable basis.&quot;'&quot; - Ward S., &quot;Let the legal

the doctrine of informed consent see, for instance, Robertson G., &quot;Informed
Consent to Medical Treatment&quot; Law Quarterly Review 1981;97:102-126,
or, historically as an ethical construct, see Beauchamp T., Childress J.,

Its value in the present paper lies in the fact that it stems from a respect
for individual decision-making: whether we regard this from a rights-based
Kantian argument of treating patients as ends in themselves rather than
as means to an end, or utilitarian arguments along the lines of JS Mill
of allowing individuality in order to maximise beneficial outcomes for
the overall good.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>28.This is not to say that medical ethics is not being
increasingly taught. &quot;We wish, however, to correct the impression
given by Mary Kearns that doctors who pass through Edinburgh University
Medical School have not studied medical ethics. ... In the pre-clinical
years, students are introduced to the principles underlying medical ethics
and these are related to issues of confidentiality and informed consent.
The application of medical ethics then features formally as part of at
least four clinical attachments, and involves particular consideration
of issues surrounding dying and euthanasia, human genetics, fertility,
abortion and decision-making.&quot; - Boyd K., Thomson D., Porter M., Watson
G., Fleming S., &quot;Medical ethics&quot; The Scotsman (letters) 25 May
1996. Yet in the history of medicine there can be observed, for instance,
a bias against truth-telling both in the disclosure of information and
in admitting fault, and that this is inconsistent with public morality
and that of other professions is apparent. Solicitors, for instance, are
&quot;obliged by the rules of professional conduct to inform a client if
they have acted negligently or improperly in the performance of their work.
This is not incumbent on ... the surgeon or physician who tends you in
ill health...&quot; - Napley D., &quot;The ethics of the professions&quot;
Law Society Gazette 1985;82:818-825, quoted in Gillon R., Philosophical
Medical Ethics, Chichester: John Wiley &amp; Sons 1995;pp.168-169. Sometimes
the law does not seem overly tolerant at this lack: &quot;How much and
what sort of information should be given to the patient? Where there has
been a mishap the patient must be told. Where in giving treatment by injection
a needle was broken, without negligence, and left in the patient's body,
it was held to be negligent not to tell the patient of the presence of
the broken needle (Gerber v Pines, 1933, 79 S.J.13...)&quot; - Carrier
J., Kendall I., Medical Negligence: Complaints and Compensation, Gower
1990. Truth-telling, as a basic principle (even one requiring exceptions),
has generally been absent from medical codes even from the time of Hippocrates.

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>29.&quot;Suppose a nurse ... discovers that a patient
has been prescribed twice the normal dose of a drug. Although he is dubious
he gives it anyway, claiming that his only responsibility is to administer
drugs as prescribed by the doctor. If the dose is incorrect, this nurse
considers that it is the doctor's fault and not his. this stance conflicts
with the idea of a nurse as an autonomous practitioner and patient advocate.
The UKCC encourages nurses to act as advocates for patients and defines
advocacy as being 'concerned with promoting the well-being and interests
of patients and clients'. ... The nurse remains morally and legally accountable
for his own actions and if he fails to clarify the situation, then it must
be assumed that he has good reasons for giving the drug or has chosen to
disregard the fact that he is accountable. He will have difficulty justifying
either option.&quot; Fletcher N., Holt J., Brazier M., Harris J., Ethics,

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>32.&quot;In sum, therefore, British courts have made no
real pretence at setting anything other than a professional test for disclosure.

disclosure cases as it is in cases involving the application of technical

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>36.It has been observed that Dunn LJ, in Sidaway, seemed
not unreasonably led astray by this. &quot;Thus, Dunn LJ's conclusion,
that the standards of the medical profession are to be applied, begs the
question by assuming that information giving is the same as advice giving.
This mis-analysis is clear when Dunn LJ goes on to argue that 'in giving
advice the professional man will normally refer to the advantages and disadvantages
of the course which he recommends.' But this is precisely to misstate what
patient self-determination is all about. Advantages and disadvantages are
evaluations which only patients can make. What doctors must give is information
about alternatives and consequences, including risks, thereby enabling
the patient to judge for him- or herself.&quot; Kennedy I. op. cit., supra,
p.183.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>37.This is not easily dismissed as speculatively tainted
view of beneficent medical practice. For a concrete and graphical example

York: Oxford University Press 1994;pp.37-38.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>38.&quot;...physicians are very well aware of their power
to influence patient choices - even while preserving the appearance of
obtaining informed consent. The Latinate obscurity of medical diagnosis
and the overwhelming nature of too much medical information often contribute
to this possibility. Thus, many physicians claim they can get patients
to agree to nearly anything they propose; it is simply a matter of how
the choice is framed.&quot; Battin M., op. cit., supra, p.169.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>40.Even arguments limiting such bias will mostly attempt
to respect someone's &quot;autonomy&quot; other than that of the doctor
infringing the autonomy of someone else, as for instance, in the controversial
case of Re S (adult refusal of treatment) [1992] 4 All ER 671, (1992) 9
BMLR 69, when the patient's autonomy in refusing a Caesarian was overruled
in favour of respecting the hypothetical autonomy or will-to-live of the
unborn foetus (referred to in the judgement as the &quot;unborn child&quot;).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>41.The BMA, for instance, says: &quot;Patients can only
make valid choices on the basis of shared information about diagnoses,
prognoses and realistic treatment options.&quot; (British Medical Association,
Medical Ethics Today, London: BMA 1993;p.177) yet give little or no guidance
on how such information is to be shared. Some practical suggestions are
made in McNulty C., &quot;Mentally Incapacitated Adults and Decision-making:
a psychological perspective&quot; Medicine, Science &amp; the Law 1995;35(2):159-164,
viz: &quot;The phrases 'simple language' and 'broad terms' are ambiguous.
To be of assistance, these phrases need to be operationalized in a way
that leaves no room for uncertainty.&quot; (p.161), and: &quot;Other practical
techniques for assisting a person to engage in decision-making include
the presentation of information in non-verbal formats: for example, Carson
(1993) suggests breaking information down into discrete units and perhaps
employing flow charts and diagrams.&quot;(p.162).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>43. Consent forms are only one means of obtaining consent,
but have their place if designed with consideration of the ethical dynamics
involved. They cannot, of themselves, be a substitute for interactive giving
of information, no matter how much information is contained on them. A
consent form does not take into account what facts might be most important
to that particular patient. Neither does it explain facts in the way that
that patient might have reasonably have desired. &quot;Truthfulness is
not the bald communication of facts: it is the kind of sensitivity to individual
need which knows that there is a time to speak and a time to remain silent.&quot;

Press 1992;p.27.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>44.Why is &quot;enhancing awareness&quot; important if
a patient is presumed competent? One reason might be that: &quot;An autonomous
person who signs a consent form without reading or understanding the form
is qualified to act autonomously by giving an informed consent, but has
failed to do so.&quot; Beauchamp T., Childress J., Principles of Biomedical

as it stands, for the doctor to select information with the patient's viewpoint
uppermost: &quot;...it is the physician who identifies the problem, frames
any suggested solution to it, and controls how many alternative solutions
are proposed. The patient cannot know whether the problem could be seen
in some other way or as some different sort of problem, whether other sorts
of solutions could be proposed, whether in making the choice to give or
withhold consent he or she is making a choice among all the reasonable
alternatives, and, sometimes, whether there really is any problem at all.

as seen, for instance in R. v. Cox [1994] 12 BMLR 38,45. (Staff Nurse recognised
that a doctor had administered &quot;a lethal dose of potassium chloride&quot;
to a woman dying in unrelievable pain and reported the fact, regrettably
if quite correctly, to her superiors.)</FONT></P>

R., Schonwetter R., Kramer D., Robinson B., &quot;Living Wills and Resuscitation
Preferences in an Elderly Population&quot; Archives of Internal Medicine
1995;155:171-175:- &quot;The group with living wills desired less CPR in
scenarios involving functional impairment and cognitive impairment, but
not in scenarios involving current health, severe illness, and terminal
illness. After receiving CPR information, both groups changed their preferences
such that intergroup differences were no longer seen. ... Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation information can influence preferences even among persons
with living wills, implying that preferences are neither fixed nor always
based on adequate information.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>62.&quot;To make decisions with your doctor you need to
know as much as possible about your health care. Ask your doctor about
what you don't understand. Your other health care providers, such as your
nurses, social workers, therapists, and chaplains, are also very good sources
of information.&quot; VA Medical Center, &quot;Advance Directives - Making

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>63.Another possibility might be a person trained in law:
&quot;As people with AIDS lie dying, they do not only need physicians,

1995;25(2):13-19,p.13. The Times points out that &quot;an increasing number
of nurses and other health workers are retraining to become lawyers&quot;
and the UK now has a Nurses in the Law Association (Nila), one of whose
main aims is to recognise and promote the additional skills which former
nurses bring to the law (Bawdon F., &quot;Lawyers with a bedside manner&quot;
