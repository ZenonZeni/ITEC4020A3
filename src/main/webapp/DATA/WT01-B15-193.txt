Radiation is a natural part of our every day lives.  Cosmic rays filtering through the atmosphere are an example of natural radiation, as is radon gas.  In fact, radiation in some forms is necessary to life on earth.<P>

More than four-fifths of the radiation we receive comes from natural sources like sunlight, soil and certain types of rocks.  This is called background radiation because it is present everywhere all the time.<P>

In addition, people are exposed to radiation from manufactured sources.  There is no difference between background radiation and manufactured radiation.  Common household items like color televisions and smoke detectors are sources of what is called man-made radiation as are x-rays.  These man-made sources account for less than one-fifth of our radiation exposure.  <P>

<H4><B>Radiation Basics</B></H4>

The study of radiation begins with the atom.  Tremendous amounts of energy are stored in an atom's center, or nucleus.  Scientists have studied how to split an atom in order to capture the energy stored there.  When atoms are split, two things are produced:  one is heat, the other is radiation.  The heat produced in this type of reaction can be used to turn water into steam and produce electricity.  This is the basis for nuclear power production.<P>

The radiation produced from splitting an atom's nucleus is emitted in three forms: alpha and beta particles, and gamma rays.  Alpha particles are the slowest moving of the three types of radiation.  They can travel only a few inches in the air, and can easily be shielded by a sheet of paper or the outer layer of a person's skin.  Alpha particles are only harmful if swallowed or inhaled.<P>

Beta particles are more energetic than alpha particles.  They can travel in the air for a few feet.  Although they can pass through a sheet of paper, they can be stopped with a sheet of aluminum foil, or glass.  Like alpha particles, they may cause the most serious effects if swallowed or inhaled.<P>

Gamma rays, unlike alpha or beta particles, are pure energy and are essentially high-energy x-rays.  This type of radiation can be very penetrating and requires shielding from such materials as concrete, lead, steel or water to stop them.  Water, as a natural barrier to radiation, is used often to isolate radioactive spent nuclear fuel assemblies at nuclear power stations.<P>

A person's exposure to radiation is measured in units called millirems.  Millirems measure the effects of radiation on the human body just as degrees measure temperature.  An average American's exposure to radiation is about 360 millirems per year.  Roughly 300 millirems come from natural sources of radiation; 60 millirems come from man-made sources, primarily medical procedures.  Less than one millirem per year comes from the use of nuclear power.<P>

<H4><B>Other Factors</B></H4>

Geography can play a part in how much radiation a person receives.  Background radiation varies from state to state. A person living in Louisiana would receive 92 millirems per year.  The same person in Colorado would receive 179 millirems per year.  Colorado's dose is higher due to that state's higher altitude and soil content. The atmosphere is thinner at higher altitudes and allows more radiation exposure from space to penetrate.  In Kerala, India, with the highest known level of background radiation for an inhabited area, a person receives 1,300 millirems per year, more than three and one-half times as much as a person living in the U.S.<P>

It is not uncommon for people to receive far more than the average of 360 millirem per year  due to a variety of other factors.  Airplane travel, dental and medical x-rays, and occupation may affect average radiation levels.<P>

<H4><B>Setting Limits</B></H4>

Standards for public protection from the effects of radiation have been in existence for more than 40 years.  Exposure standards are set by the U.S. National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement, the International Commission on Radiation Protection, and the International Atomic Energy Agency. <P>
 
Federal law requires that nuclear facilities be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Maximum exposure for the general public from the operation of a nuclear facility is set at 25 millirems per year.  Exposures far below this limit are achieved by employing conservative design features and adhering to strict operating procedures for all fuel handling operations.  <P>

<H4><B>Some Examples</B></H4>
<UL>
<DD>A person flying in an airplane across the country would add about 5 millirems per flight because of the increased elevation during the trip.  Airline pilots and flight attendants are exposed to higher levels of radiation routinely due to their occupations.<P>

<DD>A person receiving a full set of dental x-rays would add about 40 millirems per year.<P>

<DD>A person living directly outside a nuclear power facility would add approximately 1 millirem per year.<P>

<DD>A person working in a nuclear power plant would add approximately 300 millirems per year.<P>

<DD>A person sitting on a park bench as a truck carrying nuclear waste passes by would add less than one-tenth of a millirem.<P>
