<FONT SIZE=3><B>International Diversification and Defense Market Assessment Program:</B> This program provides information that addresses the immediate need to find new markets for dual-use and defense products.  The program also provides diversification and market assessment information to U.S. firms.  These guides provide a variety of information regarding non-traditional dual-use and defense markets in the<A HREF="http://netsite.esa.doc.gov/oeci/2272.html"><B><I> Pacific Rim</I></B></A>, <A HREF="http://netsite.esa.doc.gov/oeci/2606.html"><B><I>Europe</I></B></A>, the <A HREF="http://netsite.esa.doc.gov/oeci/2e22.html"><B><I> Middle East</B></I></A>, and the <NOBR><A HREF="http://netsite.esa.doc.gov/oeci/2e1e.html"><B><I>Western Hemisphere</I></B></A>.</NOBR>  Each guide gives comprehensive information on how to do business in targeted countries, as well as specific commercial and defense trade opportunities open to U.S. firms.  These guides are designed for small businesses that are new to exporting.  The goal of the market assessment program is to help U.S. firms maintain revenue from alternative domestic and/or international markets which, in turn, allows time to implement diversification or conversion programs. <P>

<B>Defense Trade Advocacy:</b>  BXA serves as an advocate for the U.S. defense industry in efforts to compete for overseas procurements.  BXA generates high level government-to-government advocacy on behalf of U.S. industry.  The agency also serves as industry ombudsman in the interagency community, interjecting economic and competitiveness considerations as well as overall industry concerns into U.S. arms transfer determinations.<p>

<B>The Resource Matching Program:</b> BXA's Resource Matching Program is a series of seminars tailored to meet the specific needs of the regions of the United States in which the events are offered.  The goal is to help firms that are dependent on U.S. defense contracts to develop new business opportunities in growing domestic and international markets.  Firms participating receive "hands-on" guidance from government experts and private sector executives who explain strategies they have successfully implemented.  Seminar topics include: <p></font><font size=2>

<B>The Competitive Enhancement and Defense Diversification<BR>Needs Assessment Survey
Program:</b> This program rapidly determines the specific needs of individual companies and matches them  with federal and state defense diversification and competitive enhancement programs.  To participate, a company simply completes a short confidential survey about its operations such as line of business, sales, employment, and research spending, and what type of assistance would benefit it in its diversification efforts.  The survey includes a checklist of the types of assistance available such as manufacturing technology development/deployment, product/service development, technology transfer, research and development programs, exporting, financing, marketing, worker retraining, and business development. <P> 

The information from each survey will be matched with specific agency resources, and forwarded to appropriate members of an Interagency Response Team while providing the firm with a list of which of the 65 participating agencies will be contacting them in the near future.  Team members follow up directly with the firm, detailing what services (financial, technical or marketing assistance) they can provide.  Firms do not have to be a defense supplier to benefit from this free program.  <P> 

To receive a copy of the Needs Assessment Survey, please use the <A HREF="feedback.htm"><B><I> e-mail order form</I></B></A>.  You can also <A HREF="http://netsite.esa.doc.gov/oeci/267a.html"><B><I>download </font><font size=3></I></B></A> the survey form from the website of our program partners, The Economic Development Administration.<P>
