CONFLICTING LOYALTIES: LAW &amp; POLITICS IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,
1789-1990 by Nancy V. Baker. University Press of Kansas, 1992. 148 pp.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
As its subtitle suggests, CONFLICTING LOYALTIES examines how U.S. attorneys
general respond to the inherent conflict that arises from competing pressures
from the spheres of law and politics.<BR>
<BR>
The author has two purposes. The first, stated on page 1, argues that examining
the tensions these pressures produce &quot;may enable us to clarify our
expectations of the office and reject those that are unrealistic or problematic.&quot;
The second, largely implicit, seeks to go beyond clarification of expectations
to increase our understanding of the factors that shape how attorneys general
behave. The most explicit statement of this second purpose follows the introduction
to the book's principal conceptual distinction: the &quot;Advocate&quot;
and the &quot;Neutral&quot; styles of behavior in office. It reads (35),
&quot;Most of this book will test the validity of these two ideal types
against the actual experiences of several attorneys general.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The book &quot;draws on an empirical examination of almost forty attorneys
general [among the seventy-five who have served].&quot; (36) It relies primarily
on published sources, though Professor Baker also examined archival material
in four presidential libraries and conducted a handful of interviews with
several former attorneys general and other Department of Justice officials.<BR>
<BR>
The book succeeds in achieving the first purpose. Throughout, Professor
Baker recounts a number of fascinating stories of the important roles a
number of attorneys general have played as legal and political decision-makers
and occasionally as the architects of scandal. Most students of the federal
legal process will be familiar with descriptions of the troubled tenure
of A. Mitchell Palmer, Harry Daugherty, and John Mitchell, and the more
uplifting tenure of Harlen Fiske Stone and Edward Levi. Fewer will know
much about Caleb Cushing, who played a central role both in securing Franklin
Pierce's nomination and in shaping his administration's policies. The discussion
of the relationship between Griffin Bell and President Carter and his other
advisors provides an especially rich and interesting glimpse into the dynamics
of attorney general's behavior.<BR>
<BR>
There are no surprises in the final chapter's discussion of the complex
mix of advantages and disadvantages flowing from both the &quot;Advocate&quot;
and &quot;Neutral&quot; styles. Professor Baker argues that even a Neutral
who avoids overtly political decisions nonetheless makes political choices
in fulfilling the office's responsibilities. She concludes that &quot;under
ordinary circumstances&quot; the Advocate style better meets the conflicting
demands of the office. The discussion provides a useful and sound overview
of the office's place in the American political system. The synopsis of
competing views of the appropriate relationship between the president and
the attorney general in chapter one and the summary of the development of
the office in chapter two are also worthwhile.<BR>
<BR>
There are some surprising omissions in Professor Baker's coverage that limit
the book's success in clarifying our expectations of the office. It largely
ignores existing literature on federal judicial administration, United States
attorneys, the solicitor general, and the anti-trust division, among others.
Its treatment of special prosecutors and the problems posed when the decisions
of an attorney general affect the partisan fortunes of his president, his
party, or the opposing party is far less extensive than it should be. Ramsey
Clark's tenure receives little attention. Most serious is the failure to
explore fully Elliot Richardson's decision to resign rather than accede
to President Nixon's order that special prosecutor Archibald Cox be fired.
This act, and the sequence of events triggered by the &quot;Saturday Night
Massacre,&quot; played a pivotal role in recent American political history.
It offers an unsurpassed opportunity to explore<BR>
<BR>
Page 108 follows: <BR>
<BR>
how an attorney general's loyalties can be in conflict, and how the resolution
of the conflict matters.<BR>
<BR>
The book largely fails to achieve the second purpose. Readers seeking a
well-grounded, conceptually sound approach to enhance their understanding
of how the office of attorney general fits into the political and legal
systems will find this book disappointing. Professor Baker possesses a good
instinctive understanding of a variety of factors that shape how attorneys
general behave. But nowhere does she present in a systematic way the variables
that shape the office and its occupants; nor does she discuss how these
variables interact. A partial list of the factors mentioned at various times
suggests the value of such systematic inquiry. They include: the nature
of the president's personality and management style, the politics surrounding
the appointment of the attorney general, the general political environment
(for example, whether scandal recently touched the Department of Justice
or attorney general; whether the president's party controls congress); the
attorney general's concept of the law and his role; the strength of competing
sources of both legal and political advice in a president's administration.<BR>
<BR>
Problems also arise in the use of the &quot;Advocate -- Neutral&quot; typology.
Professor Baker acknowledges that it is &quot;rudimentary,&quot; but it
is more rudimentary than it needs to be. The most detailed presentation
of the typology appears in two brief paragraphs in Chapter One. The book
contains the raw material necessary to construct a well grounded portrait
of the strategic environment of the attorney general. It could then examine
how the personal characteristics of individual attorneys general interact
with the strategic environment to produce different styles. Some version
of the &quot;Advocate -- Neutral&quot; distinction would probably result.
But it would be more powerful and useful if it were constructed from a richer
set of variables. For example, one could distinguish between an active and
neutral style in two spheres of activity -- as head of the Department of
Justice and chief legal officer, and as a policy advisor and participant
in forming broad domestic and foreign policy. The resulting four-fold classification
would provide a start in providing a more sophisticated and useful scheme.<BR>
<BR>
As the distinction is used, it is not clear whether Professor Baker systematically
applied a set of established defining criteria to categorize the attorneys
general she studied as &quot;Advocates&quot; or &quot;Neutrals.&quot; A
summary table listing these criteria and how they are operationalized, and
another placing the forty individuals studied along the &quot;Advocate --
Neutral&quot; continuum would have clarified the conceptual scheme and eliminated
some of the confusion I repeated encountered. One example conveys the nature
of this pervasive confusion. Benjamin Brewster, discussed at length in the
chapter on the Neutral attorney general, &quot;became one of Arthur's trusted
advisors in political as well as legal affairs.&quot; (135) The text continues,
&quot;This broad advisory role seems to conflict with the Neutral type,
except that Arthur himself acted in such a surprisingly nonpartisan way
while in office.&quot; Here, the degree of a president's partisanship apparently
controls the decision to classify an individual along the book's central
conceptual dimension, forcing someone whose behavior would qualify him as
an &quot;advocate&quot; in a different president's administration into the
&quot;neutral&quot; camp. <BR>
<BR>
If CONFLICTING LOYALTIES fails to advance our understanding of the role
attorneys general play in American law and politics as much as it might
have, it does take a step forward in doing so. It demonstrates well that
much interesting and important work remains to be done. The book provides
a useful starting place for Professor Baker and others interested in the
federal legal process to advance our systematic knowledge of the role the
office plays. <BR>
