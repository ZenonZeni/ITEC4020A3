<h5>Go forth as you have gone before,<br>
Be loyal, loving, tender as of yore,<br>
But above all be quiet:<br>
The quiet spirit to God is dear,<br>
The quiet soul to Him is near,<br>
And the life of faith is quiet.<br><br></h5>
<hr>
<p>


This poem precisely expresses some of the demands made on women in nineteenth-century Denmark: the cardinal feminine virtues were calm, restraint, tenderness towards others and modesty about oneself.<p>

The strange thing about the poem is that it was written in the mid-1850s by the woman who, more than any other individual, was to influence the potential of Danish women to educate themselves, to win freedom of choice, and to develop into strong, dynamic women. It was the educationalist <i>Natalie Zahle</i> (1827-1913) who wrote it. It was she who, fifty years later, had sent the first generations of women pioneers out from her women’s schools into political, professional and teaching careers of all kinds; out into offices and positions where they worked, competed and expressed themselves on an equal footing with men.<p>
<h3>
<a name="1">Women in Nineteenth-Century Denmark</a></h3></a>
One must of course wonder at this paradox: how could generations of girls be brought up with Victorian ideals and still become independent, inquiring, freedom-loving women? There are several reasons. They all help us to understand why in the last 150 years Danish women have had so many opportunities for education and have been left relatively free to choose.
<p>
<b>Growth of intellectual and spiritual freedom</b><br>
The influence of the European revolutions and liberation movements was strong. The nationalist feeling - called “the spirit of 48” - that had grown out of Denmark’s war in Schleswig-Holstein in 1848-51, also captured the imaginations of women. The women were the young daughters of churchmen, civil servants and independent farmers, from homes where there was a preoccupation with the building of the new society that began to blossom with the country’s first great parliamentary constitution of 1849. The homes were no longer able to keep these daughters - and the daughters for their part were not particularly interested in just waiting to be kept in a marriage. They thirsted for knowledge and skills, and longed to take part in the first growth of intellectual and spiritual freedom that the young democracy of the country had given its sons.

<p><b>No education for women<br></b>
On the other hand, there was at this time no education for girls or women over the age of fourteen. There were a few “daughters’ schools” and finishing schools which unsystematically, and oriented towards the daughters of the languishing higher aristocracy, gave their pupils an aesthetic education, with the aim of turning them into the “gardeners of domestic life” - or the chorus of a Greek tragedy, as the famous Danish actor and dramatist couple the Heibergs put it.
<p>
<b>The wish to play an active role<br></b>
Against this a wish arose for the daughters of the country to play an active role in the formation of the family, the state and the nation. They were to learn to be useful to their country - first and foremost for the sake of the country; later for the sake of the family and of their role as mothers and educators of coming generations. And early - as early as the beginning of the 1870s - the first calls came for the daughters to be educated and brought up as whole human beings on an equal footing with the sons of the country for their own sake.
<p>
<b>The old culture - and a new ideal<br></b>
But irrespective of whose sake it was for, the women themselves were part of the old culture and did not really wish to break with it. They wanted to build on it, reform it and develop it into a culture that opened up to the feminine as something nourishing and useful, and gave both sexes access to knowledge, careers and influence.
<p>
For these reasons even the feminists and pioneering educationalists could live with the fact that the educational journals, newspapers and the public in general expressed a Victorian female ideal, while the women themselves in practice broke with this and shaped their own gender-transcending ideal; an ideal that gave women the right to privileges and qualities that had hitherto been reserved for men. 
<p>
<h3><a name="2">The private girls’ schools and the unified schools</a></h3>
Whereas the state and the authorities left the confirmation-age girls and their families to their own devices, younger women went to work building up real schools on their own, private initiative. These energetic women’s struggle for education, their desire for access to politics and careers, accorded well with their demand for intellectual freedom. But those who took part in public debate and mobilized other women in this direction had little success with their schools. This was true, for example, of <i>Pauline Worm, Athalia Schwarz</i> and <i>Mathilde Fibiger</i>. The parents did not dare send their daughters to the schools of such emancipated women.
<p>
<b>The pragmatic strategy<br></b>
But what happened now was that other progressive women of this generation acted, but stayed silent in the debate. Pragmatically, systematically and deliberately, they began to build up schools: preparatory schools, primary schools, higher girls’ schools, teacher training schools for women. They knew that in public they must speak with the tongues of the age, but at the same time that they could act against and beyond the tendencies of the time.
<p>
That is why the verses quoted above urge quietness and restraint. Not because they were meant to deceive the girls, but because they had to express the notion of a feminine and religious educational culture; they said nothing - not out loud at least - about the general human, male education that required ambition, initiative and the ability to act, and for which the pioneering educationalists wanted to prepare the young girls and women. But they seem to have thought that it should be developed in practice. At all events this pragmatic strategy was a great success. The leading figure behind it was Natalie Zahle.
<p>
<b>The unified school<br></b>
Over half a century, a unified school grew up out of the joint efforts and experiments of the pioneering educationalists. As a system that had been tried out in practice, this unified school formed the model for a new Danish general education act of 1903, which was to apply henceforth to the state schools and to both sexes. Thus it was that the activities of the pioneering women, in which they engaged without intervention or financial support from the state, became the foundation of the whole Danish public education tradition.
<p>
The unified school mapped out the pupil’s path from the preparatory school at age 6-7, through primary school until confirmation age, and on to the almost-adult pupil’s range of options in a number of higher education courses. This was a radical break with the schools and educations (for boys) of the old society, which were based on smaller, sexually segregated schools for the children, where they were in two classes from 7 to 14, after which the boys could be admitted to the military, grammar or teacher training schools.
<p>
In content, too, the unified school was different from the old schools. The aim was first and foremost learning for life, a general human education, and for the girls a formative feminine education too. Then came the teaching of basic skills with the introduction of classes in Danish and history as part of the national education. The school was to be based on the national religion, on Christianity, but was to be flexible enough to relate to, discuss and accept other religions. Thus it also had a place for pupils from Jewish, Muslim and atheist homes.
<p>
<b>Foundation of the Danish public education tradition<br></b>
The pedagogical experiments that were tried in the latter half of the nineteenth century consolidated the unified school with those traditions that have typified the Danish educational system ever since.
<p>
<b>A systematic syllabus<br></b>
In the first place, a systematic syllabus was introduced, with the Danish language and history as the basic, general subjects, and otherwise with a phased curriculum of foreign languages, current affairs, geography, religion and science, as well as the special women’s subjects: handwork, household economy and human biology.
<p>
<b>Grades<br></b>
Secondly, the system of one-year “classes” or grades was introduced: nine grades from the preparatory grade to the eighth grade, i.e. a new grade every year for the children from age 6 until 15. The experience gained from this made its impact in the act of 1899, in which it was stipulated that the pupils in the Danish state schools would be categorized “by age, progress and maturity”.
<p>
<b>Teaching practice<br></b>
Thirdly, the code words were “thoroughness” and “industry” on the one hand, and “cheerful, free dialogue” on the other.  This expressed the fact that methodical, disciplined teaching in the elementary skills went hand in hand with a free, lively, narrative-style teaching practice in the general-subject and moral areas.
<p>
<b>The class as a basic unit<br></b>
Fourthly, the idea of the school as a home, and of the “class mother” who functioned as the pupil’s social mother in the school, was consolidated. The idea was inspired on the one hand by the German educationalist J.H. Pestalozzi (1746-1827) and by the ideological founder of the Danish “folk high school” N.F.S. Grundtvig (1783-1872) and on the other by the female teachers’ own experience. Natalie Zahle trained her teachers as mentors beside their role as subject teachers. As the mother was the central figure in the home, the “class mother” was to be the unifying “soul” of the class. As the home was the safe foundation of society, the class was to be the basic unit in the larger school.
<p>
<b>The dual qualification of women<br></b>
The aim was the “utilitarian” educational ideal. This meant that both the education and upbringing of the daughters were seen as important elements in the struggle for the emancipation of women, understood as the widening of the opportunities of women in society. What the educationalists had in mind was a dual qualification of women; development of understanding and skills, and the formation of personal character were the areas in which the daughters were given the chance to enhance their potential.
<p>
<b>A consious choice between marriage and career<br></b>
At the same time the virtues of motherhood formed a core in the education of women. Domesticity, caring and the understanding of the economy, functions and aesthetics of the home formed a central foundation for the education of the girls, irrespective of how they might want to organize their later lives. They were to be able to make a conscious choice between marriage and their own career, in the sense that they would not have to marry to be provided for.
<p>
Just as there were many small schools all over the country, there were to be small schools within the system of each larger school: first the preparatory school, then the one-year grades in the primary school, and later again a range of opportunities to continue in different schools such as specialized schools, grammar schools, higher girls’ schools, teacher training or the free folk high school.
<p>
<b>From pioneering schools to State school system<br></b>
It is worth emphasizing here that many of the pioneering educationalists’ schools, in the course of the first few decades of the twentieth century - and in some cases later - became state schools admitting both sexes. On the whole, the ideas and experiments that were developed in these schools at the end of the nineteenth century became a matter of course in the Danish state schools system, as well as in many private schools and folk high schools.
<p>
<h3><a name="3">The Danish folk high school</a></h3>
The principal figures in the building-up of the Danish girls’ and women’s schools were strongly influenced by the folk high school idea. Denmark’s first folk high school opened in 1844, and on that occasion one of the things the principal said was:
<p>
The hearts of the young must be infused with love of their country, its language, its history, its customs, its manners and institutions; such however that they are made aware of their nation’s failings as well as its virtues. Without this, learning is a curse...
<p>
<b>National identity</b>
<br></b>Now, at the end of the twentieth century, we may wonder at all this talk of and emphasis on love of country and the nation. Throughout the twentieth century we have had so many gruesome examples of what extreme nationalism can lead to. But in the Europe of the nineteenth century the situation was quite different. Each nation was trying to find its own national identity. In Denmark the very expression of Danishness was by no means a matter of course. It was something that had to be fought for in a confrontation with the German-influenced public sector culture.
<p>
<b>Humanity and religion<br></b>
The ideological founder of the Danish folk high school, <i>N.F.S. Grundtvig</i>, had certain notions, quite revolutionary for his time, about humanity and religion. For him the core of the matter was being human and living a human life in one’s own country and with one’s own people. It was quite new for a Christian to be able to regard life on earth and in one’s own country as the most important thing: Christianity and faith were there for the sake of earthly life, rather than the other way round.
<p>
This attitude also revolutionized the relationship between the view of life and the view of knowledge in the broadest sense.
<p>
Mankind was made in the image of God. But it was the task of the church, not of the school, to promote Christianity and faith. The school on the other hand could agree with any human being “who becomes conscious of his spiritual nature”, whether a Christian or a heathen, a Turk or a Jew. For such people need to seek truth through both clarity and the inexplicable.
<p>
<b>The School for life<br></b>
There was thus a need for a popular “science”, popular education and information. There was a need for a school for the home and a home for the school. So the Grundtvigians too worked with the idea of the school as a kind of home. In this case in the sense that it was the school for life. The school was to become an informative, enlightening institution beneficial to life, where not information as such but the requirements of life were the real aim.

<p>The soul or principal object of the folk high school had to be “the popular”, “the communal” and “the general”. The objective was not to be a career education or a degree, although it was useful to learn a foreign language, mathematics, history and other subjects. Cultivation and information were to be their own reward.
<p>
The aim of the high school, according to Grundtvig, was to make the pupils “fit for life”. This credo, which has been behind every folk high school that has seen the light of day in Denmark since, irrespective of ideological or religious standpoint otherwise, has given the folk high school as such the potential to adapt to society at any time.
<p>
<b>Know yourself, your time and your people<br></b>
Since Grundtvig’s day, Denmark has seen Grundtvigian, Evangelical, Socialist, Social Democrat, feminist, ecological, international and a wealth of other high schools come to life, survive - and change. The common factor has been that enlightenment and the shaping of knowledge have been important activities, but not the most important. The most important thing was and is that the folk high school gave people the opportunity to learn to know themselves, their time and their people.
<p>
<b>Students' benefits<br></b>
A study has been made of how pupils at the Danish folk high schools have benefited from their stay at the high schools today. Some quotations may illustrate this:
<p>
<h5>	“I have opened up more to various types of people, people who are different from myself, and I have fewer prejudices.”
<p>
	“I have gained greater understanding of foreigners and refugees.”

<p>	“The high school is a breathing-space in life. It is life-affirming to be here - you wake up and blossom. You get a lot of new ideas to work with, and you gain friends and experiences to build on.”

<p>	“What is so impressive about the high schools is that people often come for a “negative” reason like unemployment, a sense of emptiness, uncertainty and the like - and then blossom and grow and develop.”</h5>
<p>
<b>Attitudes to the folk high school<br></b>
The folk high school’s wish to promote this kind of “fitness for life” has however often placed it in a dilemma. In times of crisis and during the creation of the Danish welfare state after the Second World War, in the 1930s and in the new crises of the past twenty years, attitudes to the folk high school have pulled in two different directions. Some have wanted the folk high schools to provide more information and proper education - qualifying education, so that the unemployed and socially disadvantaged, with diplomas in their hands, can carve themselves a place in society after their stay at the high school.
<p>
Others have wanted the folk high schools to function in these times as social institutions along the lines of treatment centres with therapy, alcohol detoxification and crisis aid of all kinds.
<p>
<b>"Day high schools"<br></b>
As unemployment has grown in Denmark, a quite new type of folk high school has grown up, the “day high school”, and a related one-year “labour market courses especially for unemployd women”, called P.47.
<p>
<b>Objectives<br></b>
Most of the courses at the day high schools last sixteen weeks or more, in most cases with thirty hours of teaching a week. The aim, as expressed in the Act on Day High Schools (No. 411, 1991 Chap. 3,) is to “strengthen the personal development of the participants and improve their potential as regards the labour market and the educational system”. At the same time it is stressed that the activities at a day high school include cultural, social, creative, aesthetic and handicraft pursuits. The objective is more to provide a setting for strengthening self-confidence and developing the desire to learn than to give the students particular qualifications and fields of knowledge - to create a teaching environment based on “the experience of the participants themselves”.
<p>
These objectives are of course influenced by the anti-authoritarian educational theories that spread like wildfire over most of Europe and the USA in the wake of the youth revolution at the end of the 1960s. But the special form they took in Denmark has far deeper roots, both in the Danish folk high school and in the traditions of the early non-state girls’ and women’s schools.
<p>
<b>Benefits<br></b>
In recent years there have been several surveys of how adult women have benefited from their time at these day high schools and labour market course schools. Some quotations can be used to illustrate this:
<p>
<h5>	“I’ve learnt an incredible amount about myself.”
<p>
	“For me it was great when I found out that I was very interested in electronics, and as I’ve said, it gave me an opportunity for further education and the courage to meet the future.”
<p>
	“I’d like to point out that the course gave me great self-confidence and the desire to get going with my education and later to look for work.”</h5>
<p>
<h3><a name="4">Learning for life</a></h3>
<b>The daughters' own investment<br></b>
There were of course male educationalists and school workers who, alongside the first generations of pioneering women educationalists with Zahle at their head, worked with the same ideas and experiments. But if we are to learn anything new from history, it is thought-provoking to see that it was the poorly educated women who were able to get the system working organizationally; and they were able to do so because, much of the way, they could work without the interference of the authorities. That was the advantage of the state’s failure to invest in its daughters.
<p>
The women developed certain views on education and upbringing that became common ground in their many different schools. And they engaged well educated men to teach themselves and their pupils, but on the women’s own educational terms.
<p>
One cannot say that they developed any actual theory. The theory was built up after the fact, so to speak, against the background of the practical experiments and inspired by those currents of the time and the country that could give their experiments spirit and perspective. The spirit of the age, and the inspiration from the German Pestalozzi, the Dane Frøbel, the Frenchman Rousseau and the Dane Grundtvig were part and parcel of their intellectual baggage, and along with oral presentation and their own specific experience of teaching, their trump cards.
<p>
<b>Emancipation by way of active commitment<br></b>
These possibilities, and this emancipation, however, did not consist of what in the western world of the twentieth century has been associated with emancipation - that is, a personal liberation from socially binding feelings for the family, the church and the nation. The Christian faith and social responsibility towards country and family were a guiding principle in their everyday work. The aim was for women to commit themselves as active, useful, intellectually equal citizens, whether they were mothers or career women.
<p>
<b>Freedom to choose and personal growth<br></b>
In return women would gain the freedom to choose and the possibility of personal growth that had hitherto been the preserve of men.
<p>
<b>The movement's peaceful course<br></b>
The reasons why this movement had such a relatively peaceful course in Denmark were, first, that it took place within the private school system, which absorbed an overwhelming number of the country’s teenaged pupils; and secondly that it kept a low profile in the face of the turbulent political and gender-political movements and public debates that secularized the country and extended democracy during industrialization at the end of the nineteenth century; and thirdly that it maintained the liberal idea that there should be freedom for a great variety of different schools, large and small; and finally that this “feminized” educational tradition grew up in close harmony with, and to some extent in collaboration with, forces in the free folk high school movement.
