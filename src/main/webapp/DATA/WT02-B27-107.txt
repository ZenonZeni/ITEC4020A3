There is a good amount of research suggesting that metacognition:<BR>
<OL>
<LI> Can at least partially explain why gifted students perform at higher levels than non-gifted students<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Why poor students seem to lag behind regardless of interventions or teaching attempts<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Can help learning disabled students perform at higher levels<BR>
</OL>
<BR>There is some research on giftedness suggesting that gifted students are significantly more metacognitive than their non-gifted peers.  For example, gifted readers are more likely to use strategies such as predicting, evaluating, and connecting new content to prior knowledge more often than non-gifted students.  Other studies have shown that cognitive flexibilite (strategic flexibility) is more prominent in gifted students.  Even when giftedness is compromised by learning disabilities, this holds true.  Furthermore, studies have shown that training "normal" students in metacognitive strategies, such as strategic flexibility, drastically improves performance, raising the question as to whether giftedness can be taught (Jausovec, 1994).<BR>

Research on Learning Disabled students suggests that some learning disabilities are at least partially due to a lack of metacognitive processing.  Additionally, studies show that interventions designed to teach LD students how to be more metacognitive can improve the academic performance of these students (Montague, Applegate, & Marquard, 1993).  In light of this, it should not be surprising that low achievers also benefit from metacogntive instruction.  Studies have confirmed positive effects on low achievers in both reading and math, and there is no reason to suspect it cannot help in other areas as well.<BR>
