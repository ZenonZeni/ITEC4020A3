<h1>CANNABIS IN CONTEXT: HISTORY, LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL TREATIES
</h1>

<p> <img src="../../../graphics/blueline.GIF"><br>
</p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p> In 1978 the South Australian Royal Commission into the
Non-Medical Use of Drugs issued a comprehensive discussion paper
on cannabis ([1]South Australia 1978). It proposed a general and
a specific definition of cannabis along the following lines.
Cannabis generally refers to 'the cannabis plant and any
preparations made from the plant, including the dried leaves and
flowering tops, resinous material separated from the plant and
refined oil' ([2]South Australia 1978, p.i). </p>

<p> Like the word 'marijuana', 'cannabis' is also used to refer
specifically to the 'dried preparations of the plant itself'
([3]South Australia 1978, p.i). The words 'cannabis resin' and
'hashish' are used when referring to the resin of the cannabis
flower. Cannabis is a Latin word meaning hemp. The expressions
'hemp' or 'Indian hemp' are particularly used in older documents
cited in this chapter and refer to the whole of the cannabis
plant. </p>

<h3>Cannabis in history </h3>

<p> From its earliest recorded uses, cannabis has been important
in commerce and warfare. Its fibrous stems have been used to make
textiles, paper, ropes and bowstrings. Cannabis has been employed
as a medicine and as a psychoactive drug for social and religious
purposes. Cannabis seeds have been used as an ingredient in the
manufacture of soap, lamp oil, paint and varnish ([4]Abel 1980,
p.x) and as bird seed. </p>

<p> According to[5] Abel (1980), the earliest recorded use of
cannabis occurred in Taiwan, approximately 10,000 years ago. It
also appears to have been used in China as early as the second
century BC for clothing, shoes, bowstrings and for its
anaesthetic properties. In India, it is known to have been
utilised for its psychoactive properties in religious ceremonies
and was an ingredient in three preparations - bhang, ganja and
charas. Its use has been documented in Asia Minor - in Turkey -
as early as 1,000 BC. Both the Greeks and Romans recorded its
efficacy as a medicine - especially for treating earache. One
particular example of its use in the Middle East must be detailed
because of its influence on misconceptions about the properties
of the drug. Between the 11th and 13th centuries AD, a sect known
as the Assassins, followers of Hasan-ibn-Sabah, dominated the
Middle East through a reign of terror. Marco Polo reported that
the Assassins used a drug. He did not identify hashish as this
drug and it appears, in any case, that the drug used by the
Assassins was not used to rouse them to bloody deeds. However, in
the 19th century a number of European writers claimed that the
word 'Assassin' was a derivation of the word 'hashish'. A link
was thus forged and popularised associating cannabis and
violence; an association that was repeated in the 20th century in
the anti-cannabis writings of Harry Anslinger, chief of the
United States Federal Bureau of Narcotics [6](Abel 1980). </p>

<p> In the Middle Ages cannabis was used for its psychoactive
effects as well as commercially. Its use as a mind-altering drug
was widespread in Egypt and seems to date from around the 13th
century. In medieval Europe cannabis appears to have been
employed as a folk medicine, particularly for the treatment of
toothache and rheumatism, and in childbirth. Its role in
witchcraft resulted in a Papal fiat in the 15th century which
condemned witchcraft and the use of hemp in the satanic mass
[7](Abel 1980). Its major use in Europe during the Middle Ages
and into the time of the colonial expansion of the European
powers was to produce ropes and cordage - especially for ships'
rigging and anchor ropes. In Italy, hemp was a major crop,
particularly important in establishing states such as Venice as
seafaring powers. The Venetians operated a state-run hemp factory
as a way of achieving quality assurance. </p>

<p> The historical importance of hemp is evidenced by a decree
issued by Henry VIII in 1533 that 'for every sixty acres of
arable land a farmer owned, a quarter acre was to be sown with
hemp. The penalty for not doing so was to be three shillings and
four pence' [8](Abel 1980, pp72-3). Hemp cultivation was clearly
a vital ingredient in enabling aspiring maritime powers to
exploit the riches of the New World. However, despite the threat
of penalties, the British had little success in stimulating the
production of cannabis domestically. They were more successful in
their American colonies: </p>

<p> 'During the 17th century Indian hemp was the basis of the
American Colonialists' trade and commerce, and so great was the
need to equip the British Navy that James I issued a Royal Decree
to instruct colonialists to increase their hemp production'
[9](Hindmarch 1972, p254). It appears that more widespread use of
cannabis in Europe for its psychoactive effects dates from the
period of colonial expansion. </p>

<p> Interest in cannabis and other drugs was stimulated by the
diaries and journals of travellers who described the use of
cannabis and other drugs in Africa, India and Asia Minor, and by
reports from soldiers in colonial armies who experimented with
cannabis while serving overseas. One of the first Western
publications on drugs was Garcia Da Orta's Colloquies on the
Simples and Drugs of India published in 1563, which described the
effects of bhang (a concoction containing cannabis). This
publication was followed by several other books by European
adventurers published in the latter part of the sixteenth
century. These works were not only important in spreading
knowledge of cannabis' psychoactive properties, but in
popularising misconceptions about the drug. </p>

<p> For example, a widespread belief that the effects of
consuming opium and bhang (which contained both opium and
cannabis) were identical can be dated from this period. It
appears both in the works of the Dutchman John Huyghen van
Linschoten and the Portuguese Fray Sebastien. The linkage between
cannabis and violent and dangerous behaviour also dates from
around this time - in particular, from the writings of the
Orientalist Silvestre de Sacy. Colonial expansion and colonial
wars also brought with them new understandings in Europe of the
medical uses of cannabis. [10]Abel (1980) claims that by the 17th
century 'the medicinal properties of the plant were fairly well
known to the medical profession' (p116) and by 1682, cannabis
seeds were listed in the New London Dispensatory as a remedy for
coughs and jaundice. </p>

<p> In addition to increasing interest in cannabis being shown by
scientists and doctors, hashish (and other drugs such as opium)
became known to European students, writers and artists. In
England, Egyptian hashish sweets such as Turkish Delight were
eaten by university students. In the 19th century, hashish was
used by the French Hashish Club which numbered among its members
Theophile Gautier, Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo and Eugene
Delacroix. While not so popular among English writers and
artists, it was used around the turn of the century by the
Decadents including WB Yeats and Ernest Dawson. For French and
English writers, hashish, like other drugs, was taken to give
them new experiences to write about, as a plot device, and it was
employed to enhance creativity. </p>

<p> Another important aspect of the colonial experience in the
spread of cannabis to Western Europe is seen in the work of W.B.
O'Shaughnessy, an Irish doctor posted to India who is credited
with introducing cannabis to Western medicine [11](Abel 1980).
While in India he experimented with cannabis in the treatment of
a wide range of diseases including rheumatism, cholera, tetanus
and epilepsy, and was enthusiastic enough about its usefulness to
commission its conversion to a form suitable for medicinal use.
This extract was widely prescribed for childbirth, migraine,
insomnia, coughs and the treatment of opium withdrawal [12](Abel
1980). </p>

<p> However, Western use of cannabis for medicinal purposes did
not extend much beyond the first few decades of the 20th century.
The medical profession turned its attention to other drugs and
other methods of administration. The science of organic chemistry
enabled drugs like morphine and cocaine to be isolated, and
chemical synthesis of drugs such as heroin to occur [13](Musto
1991). The hypodermic syringe was invented in 1845 and enabled
more efficient administration of drugs. Morphine was isolated in
1803 and unlike cannabis was water soluble and thus injectable
[14](Abel 1980). </p>

<p> Further, the growth of the pharmaceutical industry enabled
the new drugs to be mass produced, advertised and distributed
[15](Musto 1991). In addition, the strength of commercially
available cannabis varied considerably, and administration of the
same amounts of the drug appeared to elicit different responses
in different patients. There were reports of adverse effects in
patients [16](Manderson 1993). </p>

<p> In contrast, drugs like morphine and later heroin were
enthusiastically embraced by doctors because they were
fast-acting, and provided reliable and very effective pain
relief. Some use of cannabis for medical purposes did remain.
Until the late 1930s 'Parke Davis, Eli Lilly and Squibb ...
marketed preparations of cannabis extract and promoted them for
the treatment of asthma, tension and pain' [17](South Australia
1978, p98). Cannabis appeared as 'extractum cannabis' in the
United States Pharmacopoeia until 1942 (Australia 1977). In
Australia, tincture of cannabis was used until the mid-1960s
[18](Caswell 1992). </p>

<p> Medical and scientific interest in cannabis has largely been
dormant until recently. In the United States renewed attention is
being given to its possible therapeutic properties, particularly
as an anti-emetic for cancer chemotherapy patients and as an
agent for reducing intra-ocular pressure in glaucoma sufferers
([19]Trebach &amp; Zeese 1990). Some scientific debate is also
occurring in Australia [20](Caswell 1992; see also [21]Appendix
1). </p>

<p> If non-medical consumption of cannabis in the 19th and early
20th centuries was regarded as a problem at all, it was in
respect of its use by colonised peoples and minority groups.
However, in relation to colonised peoples, the attitudes of the
Western powers were far from consistent. For example, cannabis
was widely used in India and Egypt - both subject to British
rule. In Egypt, local officials and foreign rulers, including the
Turks, attempted to suppress its use in the 19th century. The
British, who received no revenues from Egyptian cannabis
production, supported these attempts. </p>

<p> The situation was more complex in India. The British
government initially appears to have had little interest in
cannabis use among Indians. British complacency was no doubt
largely due to the fact that, since 1798, the government had
licensed the manufacture and sale of hemp drugs in India and
received considerable revenues as a result. However, pressure
from local Indian administrators and later from their British
counterparts - concerned that cannabis use was contributing to
crime, illness and social unrest - finally resulted in the
establishment of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission in 1893. The
Commission reported in 1894. Loss of revenue if cannabis were to
be banned was a factor in the Hemp Commission's conclusion that
prohibition would not be justified. Other important
considerations for the Commission were lack of evidence about the
ill effects of cannabis, the difficulties of enforcing
prohibition and the important place of the drug in the religious
and social life of the sub-continent. </p>

<p> The use of cannabis by Black Africans was largely ignored by
the colonial powers. However, South Africa had concerns about
cannabis use among Indians brought to work in the colony. In 1870
a law was passed forbidding the smoking, use or possession of
hemp by Indians. </p>

<p> In the United States, anxiety about cannabis use was
associated with its possession by poor ethnic groups. It appears
to have been used first by Mexican refugees fleeing into the
south-western states from the 1910 Revolution. The earliest US
laws proscribing the use of cannabis can be found in those
states. Cannabis use later spread to the Black population. By
1937 there were prohibitions on cannabis across the country. </p>

<h3>Development of international treaties </h3>

<p> Australian drug laws, like those of many other countries,
closely follow the development of international drug laws, so in
this section the growth of international drug treaties will be
described. These treaties are designed to control the
international traffic in certain drugs and to encourage domestic
restrictions on their supply and use. </p>

<p> The influence of the United States in the conception and
development of these instruments has been enormous. Justice
Michael Kirby has characterised the degree of international
cooperation brought about by the fear of drugs as 'exceptional'
(1992, p312). However, fear was not the only ingredient in early
crusading by the United States for international action. A
complex array of factors was at work. </p>

<p> The first international meeting on drugs was concerned with
opium and, in particular, with Britain's opium trade with China.
It was attended by 13 nations and held in Shanghai in 1909. At
the Shanghai Conference the United States argued for a total
prohibition on opium, and was opposed by the United Kingdom.
According to [22]Abel (1980) the background to the meeting was as
follows. </p>

<p> In 1882 the United States Congress passed the Chinese
Exclusion Act. In retaliation, China prohibited the importation
of American manufactured goods: Faced with the loss of the
lucrative Chinese market, and aware of China's efforts to
eradicate its own domestic opium problem, President Theodore
Roosevelt convened an international conference in 1909 in
Shanghai to help China eradicate the problem of opium addiction
among its inhabitants. By trying to impress China with its
goodwill and concern about her drug crisis, the United States
hoped to change China's attitude towards American goods'
[23](Abel, p193). </p>

<p> While economic factors were undoubtedly important in
precipitating US action, they were not the only considerations.
Fear of social unrest, racist attitudes and moral crusading all
played a part. In addition: Missionaries from the United States
in China had long been publicising the source and the pernicious
effects of opium smoking among the Chinese. Given the role of
England in that trade, the [Indian Hemp Commission] report seemed
like a whitewash for British commercial purposes and fanned
American progressive opinion even further against the European
imperialists in Asia [24](South Australia 1979, p42). </p>

<p> The 1909 conference did not produce an international treaty.
Another international drugs conference was held in 1912. At the
1912 Hague Conference some 46 nations discussed morphine,
cocaine, cannabis and heroin, as well as opium. The outcome of
the conference was the Hague Convention for the Suppression of
Opium and Other Drugs. It required the parties to 'confine to
medical and legitimate purposes the manufacture, sale and use of
opium, heroin, morphine and cocaine' [25](quoted in Manderson
1993, p63) Both the United States and Italy wanted cannabis
included in the Convention, but they were unsuccessful. </p>

<p> The 1925 Geneva Convention on Opium and Other Drugs was a
more significant document. As a result of lobbying by Egypt,
Turkey and South Africa, who were supported by the United States,
cannabis was included in the Convention. The Convention also
created an international scheme for the monitoring and control of
traffic in narcotic drugs, together with an administrative agency
- the Permanent Central Opium Board. Import and export quotas
were established, as well as statistical reporting requirements.
The Convention required the parties to 'enact effective laws to
limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the
manufacture, import, sale, distribution, export and use of
cannabis in the form used for medical purposes at the time'
[26](South Australia 1978, p34). Significantly, the word
'legitimate' which appeared in the 1912 Hague Convention was
removed from the 1925 Geneva Convention. </p>

<p> Finally, the Narcotics Limitation Convention of 1931 targeted
the manufacture of narcotics and required the parties to limit it
to scientific and medical purposes. Controls on licit manufacture
were seen as important, because apart from illicit imports from
abroad, leakage from the licit market was a source of illicit use
in Western nations. . </p>

<h3>Inquiries into drug use and trafficking </h3>

<p> The number of inquiries into drug use and trafficking have
been legion - both in Australia and overseas. Three common
features are seen in many of them. First, many question the
alleged ill effects of cannabis use. Second, some make
recommendations for law reform. Third, most inquiries have had
little impact on public policy or legislative change in relation
to cannabis use. </p>

<p> In Australia, for example, governments have generally
preferred to rely on law enforcement, treatment and education in
their quest to reduce drug use [27](Hartland et al. 1992). They
have been far less ready to embrace a philosophical shift in
policy towards minimising the harm resulting from drug use or to
tackle politically sensitive issues such as cannabis law reform.
As mentioned earlier, the first inquiry relating to cannabis
dates from 1893 when the British administration in India
established the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission. The Commission
heard nearly 1,200 submissions, both oral and written. It had a
wide mandate, including the effects of cannabis use on 'the moral
and social life of the people of India' [28](Abel 1980, p127).
While the Commission found that excessive use of cannabis could
lead to mental disorders, immorality and susceptibility to
disease, it concluded that the evidence demonstrated 'most
clearly how little injury society has hitherto sustained from
hemp drugs' [29](quoted in Abel 1980, p131). In particular, the
Commission reported that moderate use had no appreciable physical
or mental effects, did not induce immoral behaviour and had
little connection with crime. </p>

<p> Other major overseas inquiries that failed to discover any
dependence-producing properties in cannabis, harm as a
consequence of moderate use, a strong link with crime or a
progressive effect leading inexorably to use of drugs such as
heroin, cocaine or morphine were: </p>

<ul>
    <li>the Panama Canal Zone Military Investigations
        (1916-1929); </li>
    <li>the La Guardia Committee Report 1944 - United States; </li>
    <li>the Report of the Hallucinogens Sub-Committee of the
        United Kingdom Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence 1968
        (Wootton Report); </li>
    <li>the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the
        Non-Medical Use of Drugs 1972 (Le Dain Commission) -
        Canada; and </li>
    <li>the report of the National Commission on Marihuana and
        Drug Abuse 1972 (Shafer Commission) - United States. </li>
</ul>

<p> In addition, both the Le Dain and Shafer reports contained
proposals for law reform. The Shafer report recommended
decriminalisation of: </p>

<ul>
    <li>possession of marijuana for personal use in private; and </li>
    <li>casual distribution in private of small amounts of
        marijuana for no or insignificant remuneration
        ([30]United States 1972, pp152-4). </li>
    <li>It also recommended that possession in public of an ounce
        or less of marijuana should not be an offence but should
        be subject to seizure [31](United States 1972, pp152-4). </li>
    <li>The Le Dain Commission recommended that simple possession
        offences be repealed. </li>
</ul>

<p> Other overseas investigations which failed to uncover
unequivocal evidence about the harmful effects of cannabis were a
study of the United States Institute of Mental Health entitled
Ganja in Jamaica (1975), and a United States government study on
Costa Rica (1975). It should not be surmised, however, that
overseas investigations have all concluded that cannabis use
presented no risks to drug users. United Nations reports
published between 1973 and 1974 found that cannabis use was
likely to lead to dependence, and resulted in public health and
social problems. A 1974 US Senate report on Marihuana-Hashish
Epidemic and its Impact on US Security reported that cannabis use
resulted in brain damage, amotivational syndrome, and genetic and
reproductive defects. </p>

<p> In Australia, there have been a large number of Parliamentary
inquiries and Royal Commissions into drug use and drug
trafficking. In 1971 the Senate Select Committee on Drug
Trafficking and Drug Abuse (the Marriott Committee) was
established. Its brief included investigation into the incidence,
distribution and causes of drug use, and the adequacy of
legislation and educational programs. It concluded that penalties
for drug use should be commensurate with the different degrees of
harm presented by different drugs, that young, first offenders
should be treated leniently and that penalties for trafficking
should be severe. However, its recommendations were cautious:
that, pending further sociological and medical research, 'present
restrictions on the use of cannabis drugs should be retained in
Australia' (Australia 1971, p91). </p>

<p> The Marriott Committee report was followed in 1977 by one of
the most significant Australian inquiries into drugs. In that
year, the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare (the Baume
Committee) produced its report Drug Problems in Australia - an
Intoxicated Society? which looked at the use of licit and illicit
drugs in Australia. Like other reports, before and since, it
recognised differing harms produced by different drugs and
concluded that drug use was more a social/medical problem than a
legal one. It also considered the social and personal harms
flowing from the illegal status of some drugs and recommended
that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>'legal controls [should] not [be] of such a nature as to
        inhibit rehabilitation of the user or to cause more
        social damage than use of the drug causes' (Australia
        1977, p164); </li>
    <li>cannabis legislation should be enacted that 'recognises
        the significant differences between opiate narcotics and
        cannabis in their health effects and in the criminal
        impact on users and the community' (Australia 1977,
        p164); </li>
    <li>possession of marijuana for personal use should no longer
        be a criminal offence and should attract only a fine; </li>
    <li>penalties for possession of hashish, hashish oil and
        purified THC should remain at their present levels
        because of the potency of these drugs. </li>
</ul>

<p> Commonwealth Government response to the Baume Committee
report was both tardy and hostile. [32]Hartland (1991) quotes
Senator Baume's view of that response: </p>

<p> The Prime Minister of the day, rather than come and say I was
a fink, did something cleverer. He appointed a learned
conservative Judge to head up a Royal Commission into Drugs with
terms of reference which virtually made it inevitable that the
learned Judge would bring out a report which said we need more
social control, heavier penalties, more enforcement authorities,
and don't change the laws (p63). </p>

<p> In 1978 the New South Wales Joint Parliamentary Committee
upon Drugs handed down its Report into Drug Abuses. Its mandate
was to examine the effects, use and supply of drugs of dependence
together with policy issues. Alcohol and tobacco were not
included in the Committee's terms of reference. The Committee
expressed concern about 'the growing social stress that must be
arising from the fact that a great many young adults, by
indulging in a drug which they see as less damaging than alcohol,
run the risk not only of involvement with the criminal law, but
also have the prospect of ruined careers' [33](New South Wales
1978, p76). The report and the Committee's earlier Memorandum to
the New South Wales Parliament recommended that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>personal use of cannabis no longer be a criminal offence;
    </li>
    <li>first offenders be given bonds and probation and on
        successful completion of these, all records be expunged;
        and </li>
    <li>penalties for trafficking in cannabis be severe. </li>
</ul>

<p> The next major inquiry was the Australian Royal Commission of
Inquiry into Drugs (Williams Royal Commission). Its multi-volume
report was released in 1979. Rather than considering the degree
of harm produced by different drugs, the Williams Royal
Commission took the view that cannabis was not a harmless drug
because it produced an intoxicating effect. It concluded that
removal of prohibitions against cannabis would depart from the
intention and spirit of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs,
have a 'domino effect' in that it would stimulate calls for the
relaxation of prohibitions on other drugs, and send a signal to
the community that drug use was acceptable. </p>

<p> The Williams Royal Commission recommended that consideration
of relaxation of prohibitions on cannabis not occur for 10 years,
during which time information about the drug and its use would be
collected by National and State Drug Information Centres.
Although the Commonwealth government set up a National Drug
Information Centre, the State and Territory centres were not
established - making the review recommended by Williams
impossible. </p>

<p> Like the Baume Committee report that preceded it, the report
of the South Australian Royal Commission into the Non-Medical Use
of Drugs (the Sackville Royal Commission) prompted little
government response to its recommendations. In relation to
cannabis, the Commission dismissed the progression theory and
remarked that where cannabis users also consumed other illicit
drugs, this was due to the illegal status of cannabis itself. </p>

<p> The Committee made wide-ranging recommendations, including
the repeal of the offence of use or administration of drugs, and
the establishment of drug assessment and aid panels. Some of its
most radical proposals related to cannabis and cannabis resin. It
recommended that 'cultivation [of cannabis] for personal use, use
in private and small-scale gratuitous distribution in private to
adults ...[should] not be a criminal offence ... No distinction
... [should] be made between cannabis and cannabis resin, but
cannabis oil ... [should] remain subject to a policy of total
prohibition' ([34]South Australia 1979, p375). </p>

<p> The Commission found no evidence to 'support the view that
cannabis [was] associated with a tendency towards aggression and
violent crime' ([35]South Australia 1979, p51). In addition, the
Commission questioned some of the psychological and physiological
ill effects attributed to cannabis, such as amotivational
syndrome and psychosis (though it concluded that there was some
small risk of brain damage). In general, it did not dramatise the
possible adverse effects of cannabis use, recognising the
existence of equivocal research findings and insufficient data. </p>

<p> The next major Australian inquiry which touched on cannabis
was the investigation by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the
National Crime Authority which reported in 1989. Its terms of
reference included the scope and nature of the trade in illegal
drugs, the efficacy of law enforcement, and the costs and
efficacy of prohibition. It concluded that: 'If the aim of the
policy [of prohibition] was to reduce the use of prohibited
substances, or even to minimise access to them, it has clearly
failed' (Australia 1989, p92), And it concluded that 'should the
latest initiatives fail to make any significant inroads on the
market then it would be appropriate to consider some relaxation
of the present prohibitionism as an alternative policy' (p123).
Before concluding this section, a number of recent inquiries into
drugs should be mentioned. </p>

<p> In 1991 the ACT Legislative Assembly Select Committee on HIV,
Illegal Drugs and Prostitution tabled its report on Marijuana and
Other Illegal Drugs. The focus of the report was on the
'effectiveness of the current legal and social controls on drug
taking, with particular reference to marijuana' [36](Australian
Capital Territory 1991, p1). Proceeding from a belief in harm
minimisation and the view that drug use can never be completely
eliminated, the Committee recommended that: </p>

<ul>
    <li>possession of up to 25g of cannabis no longer be an
        offence; </li>
    <li>possession of more than 25g of cannabis and less than
        100g of cannabis attract a fine of $150; </li>
    <li>possession of more than 100g of cannabis should incur a
        penalty of $5,000 or two years imprisonment, or both; </li>
    <li>cultivation of five cannabis plants should no longer be
        an offence; and </li>
    <li>there should be no offence of self-administration in
        respect to cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<p> Another recent inquiry into illicit drugs was undertaken by
the New South Wales Legislative Council's Standing Committee on
Social Issues. However, at the date of writing, the Committee's
report had not been completed and there have been suggestions
that it will not be (Symonds 1992). In South Australia, a
Legislative Council Select Committee on the Control and Illegal
Use of Drugs of Dependence has been established. Among other
things it has been charged with reporting on the effectiveness of
current drug laws in controlling drug trafficking, the costs of
enforcing anti-trafficking laws and the social impacts of
criminal activity flowing from illicit drug use and trafficking.
In Queensland, an Advisory Committee on Illicit drugs was
established in the aftermath of the Fitzgerald Committee of
Inquiry into Possible Illegal Activities and Associated Police
Misconduct. The Committee made cannabis the subject of its first
discussion paper for a number of reasons. Among these were the
fact that cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug and the
illicit drug having the greatest impact on the criminal justice
system. The Committee is now seeking submissions on 'preferred
legislative, enforcement and social responses to the issues of
cannabis use and production' [37](Queensland 1993, p3). </p>

<h3>Australian laws </h3>

<p> Before embarking on a description of the development and
present content of Australian drug laws, it should be stated that
the Australian Constitution contains no general power to
legislate on crime. While many Commonwealth criminal laws have
been enacted incidental to the heads of power enumerated in the
Constitution, criminal laws have largely been the province of the
States. For this reason, the focus of this section is on State
and Territory legislation. </p>

<p> As[38] Manderson (1993) has remarked, consumption of drugs in
the 19th century was largely a matter of personal choice. Drugs -
including the opiates - were available from a wide variety of
sources including medical practitioners, pharmacists,
homoeopaths, sellers of patent medicines and grocers. Unlike the
opiates, however, cannabis was little known or used in the
Australia until the 1960s. There were some exceptions. For
example, medicinal use of cannabis occurred in the 19th century
and to a minor extent, in the 20th century. Cigares de Joy
(cannabis cigarettes) were sold over the counter in Australia
into the 20th century [39](Manderson, 1993). </p>

<p> However, according to [40]Manderson (1993) 'As late as 1938
Smith's Weekly reported &quot;the first appearance in
Australia&quot; of &quot;a Mexican drug that drives men and women
to the wildest excesses ... distorts moral values and leads to
degrading sexual extravagances&quot;' (p72). This drug was, of
course, cannabis. </p>

<p> A number of forces coalesced in the development of drug laws
in Australia. The first laws - poisons acts - specified certain
drugs required to be sold by medical practitioners or chemists
and stipulated labelling requirements [41](Carney 1981). However,
these labelling requirements did not apply to drugs sold under
medical prescription, to patent medicines or to homoeopathic
preparations [42](Manderson 1993, p9). </p>

<p> According to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (Australia
1989) these early controls were instituted in response to the use
of arsenic in suicides, poisonings and homicides. In 1862, South
Australia enacted the first Australian statute regulating the
sale and use of poisons [43](Carney 1981). In 1876 New South
Wales and Victoria followed with Sale and Use of Poisons Acts.
Most importantly, these early laws generally did not stipulate
who could use drugs or for what purposes [44](Fox &amp; Mathews
1992). </p>

<p> The first laws conceptualising drugs as a problem were
enacted in the 19th century and were the product of racism and
the temperance movement [45](Carney 1981). This phase of
legislative controls on the supply and use of prohibited drugs
has been characterised as involving 'the application of criminal
penalties to certain activities related to drugs, particularly
the supply of opium, which had not previously attracted legal
sanctions' [46](South Australia 1978, p33). Early laws singled
out opium smoking - a practice of Chinese immigrants who had come
to Australia in the mid-19th century during the Gold Rush. There
were two targets - the Chinese themselves and the Aboriginal
people believed to be financially and sexually exploited by the
Chinese who provided them with opium. </p>

<p> In 1891 Queensland passed the Sale and Use of Poisons Act
which proscribed the supply of opium to Aboriginal people, except
for medicinal purposes. Later other States enacted laws directed
at opium smoking - South Australia passed the Opium Act 1895, and
Victoria passed the Opium Smoking Prohibition Act 1905 and the
Police Offences (Amendment) Act 1908. The Commonwealth, by a 1905
Proclamation, banned the importation of opium suitable for
smoking. </p>

<p> While racism was a very significant force in the development
of early Australian drug laws, other influences were also at
work. The late 19th century witnessed a movement away from
laissez-faire attitudes towards greater interventionism and a
belief in the efficacy of law in promoting social and moral goals
[47](Manderson 1993). It witnessed a struggle for supremacy
between the medical professional, other health professionals and
the sellers of patent medicines. It also saw the growth of the
prohibitionist movement. Prohibitionist movements were not
confined to the United States nor to alcohol - patent medicines
and tobacco were also prohibitionist targets (Manderson 1993). </p>

<p> The second phase in the history of Australian drug laws
involved domestic implementation of international agreements
[48](South Australia 1978). The growth of international
conventions led an inexorable, although very gradual expansion of
Australian drug laws to cover cannabis. Australia was not alone
as a nation in feeling the pressure to conform to these
international instruments. However, it was subject to additional
pressures from the British government. The United Kingdom
represented its colonies and dominions at international meetings
and insisted that they comply with international controls.
Following the 1925 Geneva Convention, the Commonwealth was the
first government to succumb to the exhortations of the United
Kingdom. It proscribed the import of cannabis in 1926 through the
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Proclamation and at the same time
banned the export of cannabis. Efforts to bring the States into
line were less successful. Cannabis use in Australia was not a
problem and there appears to have been little domestic agitation
in support of proscription. However, while the response of the
States was slow, it was nevertheless inevitable: It was enough
that international organisations had called for controls and that
the calls had been heeded by the United Kingdom Parliament, whose
attitudes in this as in other matters were of paramount
importance to Commonwealth and State legislators (South Australia
1978, p6). </p>

<p> The first State controls on cannabis use were introduced in
Victoria in the Poisons Act 1928, which penalised the
unauthorised use of Indian hemp and resin. This was followed by
the Dangerous Drugs Act 1934 (SA), the Police Offences Amendment
(Drugs) Act 1935 (NSW), the Health Act 1937 (Qld), a 1950
Proclamation under the Police Offences (Drugs) Act 1928 (WA) and
the Dangerous Drugs Act 1959 (Tas). Australia's attitude to drugs
and drug laws became entrenched at an early stage. Manderson
(1993) has described it very clearly - lack of a domestic problem
(and this particularly applied to cannabis) meant that
legislation was accepted uncritically; no pressure groups existed
to stimulate debate or mount opposition, and the absence of a
drug problem meant that it was impossible to evaluate the costs
and benefits of the prohibitionist model - it was simply assumed
that the model worked effectively: </p>

<p> As the structure of modern drug laws ... took shape, each
brick depending on those beneath it for support and validity, few
remembered or even thought to question why they had ever been
laid. So effective had the gradual process of entrenchment been
that alternative approaches soon became unthinkable. What counted
was the preservation of the laws already in place. If they were
failing, the answer was simple - more of the same' [49](Manderson
1993, p75). </p>

<p> The impact of drug use in the 1960s has been well-documented
and was an international phenomenon. But until this time, drug
use was not viewed as a widespread social problem in Australia -
rather as contained and containable. The consumption of drugs
such as morphine, pethidine, opium and heroin by dependent users
was chiefly confined in Australia to those with a dependence that
was therapeutic in its origins or to minority groups - for
example, very old Chinese members of the community. </p>

<p> In 1960 Australia reported to the Commission on Narcotic
Drugs that some Indian hemp use was occurring in the 'theatrical
world' (quoted in Manderson 1993, p144). But during the 1960s,
the nature and extent of illicit drug use - including the use of
cannabis - changed dramatically. It became more widespread, it
became matter of choice (rather than 'necessity' through
therapeutic dependence), it was embraced by students and youth,
and it was associated with changing moral values and practices,
alienation, and challenges to societal values and the political
order. It brought increasing numbers of otherwise law-abiding
Australians into contact with the criminal law, criminal
penalties and associated stigmatisation. The use of drugs such as
cannabis and heroin came to be regarded both as a symptom of
social malaise and a cause of it. </p>

<p> The third phase in the history of Australian drug laws
commenced during the 1960s. From that time 'the States began
overhauling their drug laws and the Commonwealth became much more
actively involved in the field, both by ratifying new conventions
and by revising the provisions of the Customs Act' ([50]South
Australia 1978, pp35-6). In addition, in response to treaty
obligations, the Commonwealth introduced new federal laws on
drugs - the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967 was the first of these. At
state level, control of recreational drugs was gradually removed
from poisons statutes, whose original purpose was to 'regulate
and control the supply and distribution of pharmaceuticals and
poisons on public health grounds' ([51]Kirby 1992, p315), and
placed into special legislation. Drug laws and drug policies from
this time onwards can be characterised as follows. </p>

<p> First, a law enforcement approach became firmly entrenched at
Commonwealth level with the important role played by Customs,
which had no interest in any medical or public health model of
drug use or supply. </p>

<p> Second, penalties were increased. </p>

<p> Third, there were changes to basic principles of criminal law
- such as reversal of the onus of proof - in order to make
convictions easier ([52]Manderson 1993). </p>

<p> Last, there was a shift in legislative emphasis away from
drug users to drug traffickers. Both Commonwealth and some State
laws distinguished between traffickable quantities of drugs
(including cannabis) and amounts deemed as being less than
traffickable quantities. For the most part, penalties for
cultivation, production and manufacture, possession and use of
cannabis, and possession of drug paraphernalia were substantial
during the 1960s and 1970s. For example, in South Australia the
penalty was $4,000 and/or 10 years imprisonment for knowingly
cultivating cannabis (s5(2)(b)) and $2,000 and/or two years
imprisonment for knowingly being in possession, using or
administering (s5(1)). </p>

<p> Debate about cannabis, research that showed the widespread
nature of cannabis use, alarming law enforcement statistics, the
work of the early Parliamentary and other inquiries, and
difficulties in administering some drug laws, led to the first
legislative changes in the middle to late 1970s. These
distinguished between simple possession of cannabis and other
drugs. The first jurisdiction to change law enforcement practices
and then legislation was the Australian Capital Territory. A
non-enforcement policy in relation to simple cannabis possession
offences was instituted following a number of court cases in
which the police failed to secure convictions because the Public
Health (Prohibited Drugs) Ordinance did not contain a definition
of cannabis. </p>

<p> In 1975, the Ordinance was amended to include a definition of
cannabis. At the same time the maximum penalty for possession of
less than 25g of cannabis was reduced to $100. Some reforms also
occurred in the Northern Territory. Under the Prohibited Drugs
Ordinance 1977 (NT), a first offender was liable to a fine of
$500; while second or third offences of possession were more
heavily penalised, imprisonment was not provided as a sanction.
Further legislative change occurred in the 1980s. The Drugs,
Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic) contained
slightly less severe penalties for cannabis trafficking than for
trafficking in other illicit drugs. The Drugs, Poisons and
Controlled Substances (Amendment) Act 1983 set the maximum
penalty for possession of less than 50g of cannabis at $500. In
addition, s76 of the Act empowered magistrates to award an
adjourned bond in certain circumstances in the case of an offence
of possession of up to 50g of cannabis. No conviction could be
recorded in the case of a first offender. Section 76 applies only
to cannabis, not to other drugs, and it does not apply to
trafficking offences in respect of any drug. </p>

<p> In South Australia, the Controlled Substances Act was passed
in 1984. As originally formulated, the Act distinguished between
offences involving cannabis or cannabis resin and offences
involving other illicit drugs. The Act proscribed (and still
proscribes) the possession, smoking, consumption, administration
or self-administration, manufacture, sale or supply of drugs of
dependence or prohibited drugs, and the possession of drug
paraphernalia. Under the 1984 Act, the penalty for possession,
smoking or consumption of small quantities of cannabis or
cannabis resin was a maximum of $500. For any other drug of
dependence or prohibited drug the maximum penalty was $2,000
and/or two years imprisonment. Similarly, some distinctions were
made between cannabis and other drugs in respect of trafficking
offences. More significant reforms came in 1986 with the
Controlled Substances Act Amendment Act which provided for an
expiation notice scheme. The expiation notice scheme commenced
operation on 30 April 1987. Section 45a(2) of the Act enables
expiation notices to be issued to adults in certain cases - for
example, when less than 100g of cannabis or less than 20g of
cannabis resin is involved. Notices can be issued in respect of
cultivation that is not for commercial purposes, for smoking or
consumption of cannabis or cannabis resin except in a public or
prescribed place, and for possession of equipment used for the
smoking or consumption of cannabis or the preparation of cannabis
resin. Payment of the expiation fee before the expiration of 60
days from the date of the notice means that no conviction is
recorded against the alleged offender. The fees are $50 for
possession of less than 25g of cannabis and $150 for less than
100g of cannabis. In the case of cannabis resin the expiation
fees are $50 for possession of less than 5g and $150 for amounts
ranging between 5g and less than 20g of resin. Cultivation of 10
plants or less incurs a fine of $150. It should be noted that at
the same time that the cannabis expiation notice system was
introduced, amendments to the Act also substantially increased
penalties for trafficking offences. In addition, amendments to
the Controlled Substances Act in 1990 provide severe penalties
for offences such as sale, supply and administration of
prohibited drugs and drugs of dependence, including cannabis, to
a child. </p>

<p> Although some jurisdictions reformed the law relating to
personal consumption of cannabis, heavier penalties were
introduced for trafficking offences and a scale of trafficking
offences was commonly provided - for example, traffickable,
indictable and commercial quantities. Manderson (1993) puts it
this way: </p>

<p> The emphasis on Mr Big as an evil in his own right allowed a
less severe approach to drug users by removing them from the
centrality of drug laws. The harsh penalties imposed on marijuana
smokers and other users of drugs could be softened without
undermining 'the war on drugs' (p185). </p>

<p> The focus on the Mr Bigs of the drug world has also enabled
legislatures to enact drug laws which give extensive powers of
search and seizure to the police, and which give considerable
powers in relation to the use of listening devices and telephone
taps. While some reforms were put in place in the 1970s and
1980s, the picture that emerges nationally is an uneven one. </p>

<p> The Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW), for example,
distinguishes only between cannabis and other drugs in the case
of commercial trafficking. In the case of cannabis the maximum
penalty that can be imposed is $500,000 or 20 years imprisonment,
or both. For commercial trafficking in any other drugs, a life
sentence can be imposed. In New South Wales, possession,
administration and self-administration of prohibited drugs,
including cannabis, are proscribed, as is the possession of
equipment for the administration of prohibited drugs. Personal
consumption offences (involving less than five plants or less
than 25g of cannabis) make an offender liable to a penalty of
$2,000 and/or two years imprisonment. Cultivation, manufacture
and production, and supply are prosecuted on indictment. The
Drugs Misuse Act 1986 (Qld) assigns dangerous drugs to Schedules
under the Act. Drugs like heroin and cocaine appear in the First
Schedule and cannabis sativa is listed in the Second Schedule.
Offences relate to trafficking (s5), supply (s6), production of
dangerous drugs (s8), possession (s9), and possession of drug
paraphernalia (s10). </p>

<p> In addition, penalties vary in the case of aggravated supply
which is defined in s6(2) of the Act as including supply to a
minor, an intellectually handicapped person, and supply in an
educational or correctional institution. While there are
differences in the statutory penalties applicable to First and
Second Schedule drugs, they are minor. </p>

<p> Under the Drugs Misuse Act Amendment Act 1990, the penalty
for unlawful trafficking in cannabis carries a penalty of 20
years imprisonment, while for First Schedule drugs the penalty is
25 years (s5). Possession of cannabis carries a penalty of 15
years imprisonment, or 20 years imprisonment if the quantity
equals or exceeds 500g or 100 plants (s9). The penalty for
possession of drug paraphernalia is imprisonment for two years.
Offenders may be fined in addition to or instead of being
imprisoned (s54) and may be prosecuted summarily for minor
offences (s13). </p>

<p> In 1989 the Australian Capital Territory remodelled its drug
control legislation, and the Drugs of Dependence Ordinance was
introduced with the idea of it being used as a model for all
other jurisdictions. The Act establishes two classes of drug: </p>

<ul>
    <li>prohibited drugs which are subject to special treatment.
        (According to the Act's Explanatory Statement, prohibited
        drugs have no medical use and are harmful for
        recreational purposes); and </li>
    <li>drugs of dependence, which are distinguished from
        prohibited drugs in the Explanatory Statement, in that
        they are said to have a medical use. </li>
</ul>

<p> The Act defines cannabis, cannabis fibre, cannabis oil,
cannabis plants and cannabis resin. Schedule 2 to the Act lists
cannabis, cannabis oil and cannabis resin as prohibited drugs and
defines commercial and traffickable quantities of the drug. In
addition, cannabis is listed in Schedule 5 as a prohibited
plant.1 </p>

<p> The Act makes clear distinctions between personal use
activities and trafficking. It reserves extremely harsh penalties
for the latter and contains deeming provisions. It also makes
distinctions in penalties between cannabis and other prohibited
drugs. Cultivation of prohibited plants, including cannabis, is
an offence (s162(2)), as is cultivation for the purposes of sale
or supply (s162(3)), sale or supply, or possession for sale or
supply (s165(1)). Possession, self-administration and
administration of cannabis are offences under s171. </p>

<p> The harshest penalties are reserved for sale or supply of
commercial quantities of cannabis - life imprisonment (s165), and
cultivation of more than 1,000 plants - life imprisonment
(s162(3)). </p>

<p> In the Northern Territory, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1990
prescribes a penalty of $2,000 or two years imprisonment for
administering cannabis. Possession of less than a traffickable
quantity 'attracts penalties ranging from a $10,000 fine to
imprisonment for 14 years; possession of a commercial quantity
attracts penalties ranging from 14 to 25 years imprisonment. The
penalties for cultivation offences also depend on the quantity
cultivated; commercial quantities carry a 25-year prison term;
traffickable quantities carry a seven-year prison term; and other
cases attract a penalty of a fine of $5,000 or imprisonment for
two years' (Australian Capital Territory 1991, p35). </p>

<p> Like Queensland, Northern Territory legislation creates
separate offences and penalties in respect of supplying illicit
drugs to children. In the Northern Territory, the penalty is 25
years or imprisonment for life (s5). Offences and penalties
relating to illicit drugs are covered by the Poisons Act 1971 and
the Criminal Code in Tasmania, and in Western Australia by the
Misuse of Drugs Act 1981. </p>

<p> In the Australian Capital Territory, changes to the law on
cannabis were introduced by the Drugs of Dependence (Amendment)
Act 1992. These amendments were by no means as far-reaching as
those envisaged by the Legislative Assembly's Select Committee on
HIV, Illegal Drugs and Prostitution (outlined earlier) which
recommended the removal of personal possession offences involving
small amounts of cannabis. However, the amendments do introduce
an expiation notice scheme that applies to both adults and
juveniles (s171A). Under the amendments, a simple cannabis
offence is defined as: * an offence under s162(2) of cultivating
or participating in the cultivation of not more than five
cannabis plants; * an offence under s171(1) of possessing not
more than 25g of cannabis. A police officer is empowered to serve
an offence notice on a person believed to have committed a simple
cannabis offence. If the prescribed penalty of $100 is paid
within 60 days, then the offence is discharged and no conviction
is recorded. The prescribed penalty of $100 is the same as that
previously applying under the Act for possession of small amounts
of cannabis. </p>

<p> Drug law reform is still an active issue for some
Australians. In 1993, interest in drug laws and social policy
resulted in the establishment of an Australian Parliamentary
Group on Drug Law Reform - a group whose membership includes
current and former politicians from different political parties
and a range of jurisdictions, medical practitioners, researchers
and members of the legal profession. Among the short-term goals
being considered by the Committee are the rejection of criminal
sanctions for personal use of drugs and the nationwide adoption
of an expiation scheme model for personal use of cannabis
([53]Van Raay 1993). </p>

<h3>Overseas legislation </h3>

<p> In many European countries, no distinction exists in law
between the so-called 'hard' and 'soft' drugs. In a recent study
of 12 EC nations, only the following nations distinguished
cannabis from other drugs: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Spain distinguishes between 'substances which can cause
        serious damage to health and cannabis and its
        derivatives' ([54]Leroy 1991, p58); </li>
    <li>Ireland distinguishes between 'cannabis and other
        narcotic products' ([55]Leroy 1991, p58); </li>
    <li>The Netherlands distinguishes between 'substances
        presenting an unacceptable risk' ([56]Leroy 1991, p58)
        and cannabis; </li>
    <li>Italian law distinguishes between 'highly addictive drugs
        (Schedules I and III) and drugs with lesser addictive
        properties AND cannabis (Schedules II and IV)' ([57]Leroy
        1991, p58); and </li>
    <li>the United Kingdom Misuse of Drugs Act contains three
        Schedules in which drugs are placed according to their
        level of risk. Cannabis, some opiates, barbiturates and
        some amphetamines are classified as Schedule B drugs. </li>
</ul>

<p> Drug use (involving both 'hard' and 'soft' drugs) is not
proscribed in Spain, Ireland, Italy or The Netherlands.
Possession for personal use is prohibited in Spain, Ireland,
Italy and The Netherlands, but lesser penalties are provided when
possession involves cannabis. In the case of trafficking
offences, laws in Spain, Ireland, Italy and The Netherlands
impose less severe penalties when trafficking involves cannabis. </p>

<p> In the United States, the federal Controlled Substances Act
lists cannabis in Schedule 1 - where drugs with a high dependency
potential and no accepted medical use are located. Possession of
a controlled drug attracts a lighter penalty than does
trafficking. Even so, penalties for possession are substantial -
a first offender being liable to up to one year's imprisonment
and a fine of between $1,000 and $5,000. </p>

<p> During the 1970s, at State level, 11 States adopted a civil
penalty model for possession of small amounts of cannabis for
personal use. Oregon was the first State to introduce civil
penalty laws in 1973. In general, the maximum penalty for
possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use in
the 'decriminalised' states is $100. Exceptions are Mississippi
($250) and Nebraska ($200). </p>

<p> Efforts to recriminalise these activities have been described
as 'concerted' ([58]Reuter 1992), with William Bennett, the
National Drug Control Director, personally appearing before a
number of state legislatures to argue for recriminalisation. In
1990, Alaska reintroduced criminal penalties for possession of
small amounts of cannabis. </p>

<p> In Canada, the federal Narcotic Control Act 1961 has remained
largely unaltered to this day. There are six basic offences under
the Act. These are: simple possession, trafficking, possession
for trafficking, cultivation of opium or cannabis, import or
export of scheduled drugs, and prescription shopping ([59]Solomon
1988). According to Solomon, apart from the offence of
cultivation, the Act does not differentiate between scheduled
drugs. Cannabis possession can be tried summarily or on
indictment. In the case of simple possession offences, summary
conviction of a first offence renders the offender liable to a
fine of $1,000 and six months imprisonment. In the case of a
subsequent offence, summarily prosecuted, the penalty is $2,000
and one year's jail. On indictment, an offender is liable to
seven year's imprisonment. </p>

<p> The Canadian Government did not respond positively to the Le
Dain Commission recommendation that possession of cannabis no
longer be a criminal offence. However, in 1972 the Criminal Law
Amendment Act gave judges a discretion to direct that an offender
be discharged absolutely or on probation. It appears that law
enforcement officers rarely proceed on indictment in the case of
possession offences, and that 'judges rarely impose the maximum
sentence or anything close to it in cannabis cases' ([60]Solomon
1988, p126). </p>

<p> In this section, particular attention is devoted to the laws
and enforcement practices of The Netherlands and the United
Kingdom. Illicit drug laws in both countries have been influenced
by existence of international conventions. Initially both
countries enacted drug laws in the absence of a domestic drug
problem. </p>

<p> In The Netherlands illicit drug laws were first introduced in
the Opium Act 1919. Apart from amending legislation in 1928, drug
laws remained unchanged until the present Opium Act was passed in
1976. Current Dutch attitudes towards illicit drug use -
manifested in the Prosecution Guidelines that govern the
enforcement of the Act - are said to arise from a number of
factors peculiar to Dutch society and history. First, realism and
pragmatism. Second, a belief in social pluralism. Third, an
ideology of normalisation in which 'illicit drugs are seen as a
limited and manageable social problem rather than an alien threat
forced on an otherwise innocent society' ([61]Leuw 1991, p2).
Fourth, is the context of the criminal law itself. Dutch writers
stress that the criminal law is not perceived as enforcing social
morality but rather as 'an instrument of social control, whose
results must be assessed from case to case' ([62]Ruter 1988, p6).
</p>

<p> They further report that the criminal law has a minor role in
The Netherlands. Until the introduction of the Opium Act 1976,
drug offences in The Netherlands appear to have been actively
prosecuted and severely sanctioned. According to [63]van de
Wijngaart (1991), cannabis appeared in The Netherlands in the
1950s; harsh sentences were handed down, for example - 12 months
imprisonment for minor cannabis offences; and media coverage was
sensationalist. </p>

<p> However, despite sentencing practices, an increase in
cannabis use was reported, especially among Dutch youth. During
the 1960s pressure for law reform increased and culminated in
1976 with new opium legislation. The present Opium Act
distinguishes between drugs posing unacceptable risks such as
heroin, cocaine, LSD and cannabis oil, and hemp products -
marijuana and cannabis resin.2 It also decreased penalties for
possession of drugs for personal use, but increased penalties for
trafficking in hard drugs. Overlying the offences and penalties
in the Opium Act are police and prosecution guidelines which have
produced a situation that some commentators have described as de
facto decriminalisation. These guidelines relate to the
'intensity of police custody and preventive detention,
prosecutorial alternatives (dismissal, fine, or prosecution) and
penalties involving violations of the Opium Act, and were
established by the Procurators-General in 1976' (Marshall et al.
1990, p395). The guidelines are made possible by the Expediency
Principle set out in Articles 167 and 242 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. This principle operates where the public good is
served by refraining from prosecution. It can operate for both
individual offenders and categories of offence. In the case of
the Opium Act, a number of activities are designated as 'not for
prosecution, detection or arrest'. These include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>the sale of less than 30g of hemp products; and </li>
    <li>dealing in, possessing or cultivating up to 30g of
        cannabis. </li>
</ul>

<p> High priority is given under the guidelines to the detection
and prosecution of traffickers. In Britain, like Australia and
The Netherlands, drug laws were in existence long before the
existence of a widespread domestic drug problem. During World War
I concerns about drug taking by soldiers led to the issuing of
Army Council orders forbidding the supply of cocaine, heroin,
Indian hemp, morphine, and other substances to soldiers except by
medical practitioners. </p>

<p> The existence of international conventions resulted in the
enactment of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1920 - as a signatory of the
Treaty of Versailles, Britain undertook to incorporate the 1912
Hague Convention into domestic law. Even at this early stage
penalties were severe. Illegal possession of listed drugs could
result in a 200 fine or six months imprisonment, or both.
Penalties were higher for repeat offenders. The Dangerous Drugs
Amendment Act 1923 raised these penalties. However, '... at most
the total annual convictions and known addicts numbered only a
few hundred until the second half of the twentieth century'
([64]Howitt 1990-91, p357). </p>

<p> The present Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 creates different
classes of drugs according to their potential for harm and
penalises activities such as possession and cultivation. Cannabis
and cannabis resin are Class B drugs and, while subject to lesser
penalties than Class A drugs, still carry substantial penalties.
For example, summary prosecution for an offence of possession of
a Class B drug can result in three months imprisonment and/or a
500 fine. If the offender is convicted on indictment the
maximum penalty is five years jail or a fine, or both.
Cultivation of a Class A, B or C drug exposes the offender to a
penalty of six months incarceration and/or a 2000 fine on
summary conviction, and up to 14 years imprisonment or a fine, or
both, if convicted on indictment ([65]Fortson 1992). Like The
Netherlands and Australia, the most substantial penalties are
available for drug trafficking. While imprisonment is available
as a sanction for cannabis possession in Great Britain, it
appears that custodial sentences are not imposed for possession
of cannabis for personal use. In addition, enforcement of the
Misuse of Drugs Act may vary considerably throughout the nation,
especially where cannabis is involved: In an urban area if a
policeman finds a young person in possession of a few grammes of
cannabis he may deal with the matter informally or offer a
caution, and no official record will be made. In a country town
possession of exactly the same quantity of the drug might lead to
prosecution, a fine, and headlines in the local newspaper'
([66]Royal College of Psychiatrists 1987, p125). </p>

<p> As in Australia, drug law reform continues to be an issue in
Europe. Some reforms to European drug laws have been
foreshadowed. [67]Wodak (1993) reports that: the lead has come
from municipal authorities. Thirteen cities in Europe have signed
a document known as the Frankfort [sic] Declaration which commits
these municipal authorities to a programme of drug policy reform.
Thirty-three other cities have signed an expression of interest
and are considering their position. In November, this Declaration
will be signed by the Mayor of Baltimore in the United States
(p7). </p>

<p> In Italy, voters were asked in a referendum held on 18 April
1993 whether drug users should be imprisoned. The referendum was
the result of changes to drug laws in 1990 which enabled courts
to imprison drug users found guilty of possession of more than
the 'average daily dose' of a drug (dose media giornaliera)
(UNICRI, pers comm). As a consequence of the referendum, such
drug users are now liable only to administrative sanctions such
as a fine or the confiscation of their driver's licence. Drug
traffickers are still liable to imprisonment. </p>

<h3>Current international treaties </h3>

<p> The international treaties relating to cannabis are the
Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 as amended by the 1972
Protocol, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971 and the
1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances (Vienna Convention). The Convention on
Psychotropic Substances includes THC, the psychoactive
constituent of cannabis. As THC is rarely extracted for illicit
drug use ([68]Fox &amp; Mathews 1992), no further attention will
be devoted to it. </p>

<p> The Single Convention consolidated a number of previous
Conventions on narcotic drugs and amalgamated a number of
monitoring organisations to create the International Narcotics
Control Board. Australia ratified the Single Convention on 1
December 1967. Cannabis is not a narcotic drug, but is classified
as such for the purposes of the Single Convention. </p>

<p> This classification has been important in shaping public and
political perceptions - that cannabis is dangerous to personal
health and community safety. Narcotic drugs are listed in
Schedules to the Convention. Schedule I contains the major
opioids, as well as cocaine and cannabis. Schedules II and III
contain less powerful drugs such as codeine. Schedule IV contains
drugs regarded as having particularly dangerous properties.
Cannabis, as well as drugs like heroin, is part of Schedule IV.
Articles 36, 4 and 2(5) of the Single Convention are of
particular importance for the purposes of this report. Article
36(1) of the Convention provides that, 'subject to its
constitutional limitations', each Party shall adopt measures to
ensure that activities such as manufacture, possession,
distribution, sale, transport, importation and exportation of
drugs 'contrary to the provisions of this Convention ... shall be
punishable offences when committed intentionally ....'. </p>

<p> In addition, Article 4 provides that: (c) Subject to the
provisions of this Convention, [Parties are] to limit exclusively
to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture,
export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of
drugs. Cannabis is also located in Schedule IV of the Convention.
Article 2(5) requires that: (a) A Party shall adopt any special
measures of control which in its opinion are necessary having
regard to the particularly dangerous properties of a drug so
included; and (b) A Party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing
conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means of
protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the
production, manufacture, export and import of, trade in,
possession or use of any such drug except for amounts which may
be necessary for medical and scientific research only, including
clinical trials herewith to be conducted under or subject to the
direct supervision of the Party. </p>

<p> It must be emphasised, however, that Article 2(5) is not
mandatory. Rather, special measures of control can be imposed if,
in the opinion of the Party, they are 'necessary' or
'appropriate'. Under the Single Convention Parties are required
to criminalise activities relating to trafficking, subject to
their constitutional limitations. In the past, however, questions
have also arisen about the need for Parties to criminalise
activities associated with personal use and possession. The
Williams Royal Commission concluded that to remove prohibitions
against cannabis would depart from the spirit and intention of
the Convention. In Canada, the Le Dain Commission regarded
possession for personal use as falling within the ambit of the
Convention. Woltring (1990) also takes this view on the grounds
that 'possession could relate to both possession for trafficking
or possession for personal consumption' (p20). </p>

<p> However, there is authority (e.g. [69]United States 1972,
[70]Noll 1977, [71]South Australia 1978) that 'the Convention
does not require signatories to make either use or possession for
personal use punishable offences, although the creation or
retention of such offences would be consistent with the treaty.
This is because &quot;use&quot; is not specifically covered by
Article 26 and the term &quot;possession&quot; in that Article
and elsewhere can be read as confined to possession for the
purpose of dealing' ([72]South Australia 1978, p46). </p>

<p> Further, the requirement that Parties limit the use of drugs
to medical and scientific purposes does not require them to
'attain that goal by providing penal sanctions for unauthorized
&quot;use&quot; or &quot;personal consumption&quot; of drugs'
([73]Noll 1977, p44). In the view of the Shafer Commission,
measures such as 'an educational program and similar approaches
designed to discourage use' could be employed (1972, p167). While
the International Narcotics Control Board appears to be equivocal
about this interpretation of the Convention in respect of
personal possession, it does not appear to condemn it, merely
remarking in relation to the Single Convention, that Parties: may
take the view that they are not required to establish such
activities as criminal offences under law. The basis for this
view appears to be that, since obligations relating to penal
provisions appear among articles relating to illicit traffic, the
obligations only apply to cultivation, purchase or possession for
the purpose of illicit trafficking (1992, p6). The 1972 Protocol
provides for measures to treat and rehabilitate drug users in
addition, or as an alternative to, punishment. </p>

<p> It also contains provisions relating to the International
Narcotics Control Board, and international narcotics trafficking.
Australia ratified the Protocol on 22 November 1972. Australia's
international treaty obligations must now be read taking the 1988
Vienna Convention into account. Australia ratified the Convention
without reservations on 16 November 1992. While the Single
Convention attempts to contain the supply of illicit drugs by
limiting the use of scheduled drugs to medical and scientific
purposes, the Vienna Convention is directed particularly at drug
trafficking and is designed to provide a system of international
cooperation to counter trafficking activities. It must be read
subject to the Single Convention. The Vienna Convention was made
against a background of international horse-trading, and was
ratified domestically in the face of a measure of opposition. </p>

<p> An International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Traffic
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances was convened in
1987. At the Conference there was debate between the consumer,
producer and transit states about the content of the treaty.
Consumer nations felt that the Convention should target the
movement of illicit drugs between states, while producer
countries argued that the Convention needed to address drug
consumption - in other words, create obligations for drug-using
nations. As a result, provisions relating to domestic drug
consumption are included in the Convention. </p>

<p> Nevertheless, the major thrust of the Convention is towards
trafficking and international cooperation in matters such as
extradition, mutual legal assistance, and transfer of
proceedings. Paragraph 1 of Article 3 relating to trafficking
offences states that 'Each Party shall adopt such measures as may
be necessary to establish [them] as criminal offences under its
domestic law, when committed intentionally'. Paragraph 2 of
Article 3 deals with cultivation, possession or purchase for
personal use. </p>

<p> In relation to the establishment of criminal offences its
wording is different to and more qualified than that in paragraph
1. It states: </p>

<p> Subject to its constitutional principles and the basic
concepts of its legal system, each Party shall adopt such
measures as may be necessary to establish as a criminal offence
under its domestic law, when committed intentionally, the
possession, purchase or cultivation of narcotic drugs or
psychotropic substances for personal consumption contrary to the
provisions of the 1961 Convention, the 1961 Convention as amended
or the 1971 Convention. </p>

<p> In addition, paragraph 4(d) of Article 3 provides that: The
Parties may provide, either as an alternative to conviction or
punishment, or in addition to conviction or punishment of an
offence established in accordance with paragraph 2 of this
article, measures for the treatment, education, aftercare,
rehabilitation or social reintegration of the offender. Not
surprisingly, there are a number of different interpretations
that can be placed on the provisions of the Vienna Convention as
they relate to personal consumption activities. </p>

<p> The International Narcotics Control Board states that the
1988 Vienna Convention requires criminal offences to be
established in relation to possession, purchase or cultivation
for personal use. However, it adds: None of the conventions
requires a party to convict or punish drug abusers who commit
such offences even when they have been established as punishable
offences. The party may choose to deal with drug abusers through
alternative non-penal measures involving treatment, education,
after-care, rehabilitation or social reintegration
([74]International Narcotics Control Board 1992, p4). </p>

<p> Other commentators take the view that the Vienna Convention
is a trafficking convention and that, with respect to personal
use activities, a Party may choose not to retain or introduce
criminal offences for those activities if such an approach does
not accord with matters such as 'the basic concepts of its legal
system'. What then are the implications of the Single Convention,
the 1972 Protocol and the 1988 Vienna Convention for public
policy options relating to cannabis? </p>

<h3>Total Prohibition </h3>

<p> Total prohibition is the policy pursued by many of the
Parties to the Conventions - including the Australian
jurisdictions of Queensland, Northern Territory, Victoria,
Western Australia and Tasmania. </p>

<p> Some writers describe the Single Convention as prohibitionist
in nature ([75]Fox &amp; Mathews 1992); others as 'regulatory as
opposed to merely prohibitionist' ([76]Woltring 1990, p19).
Whatever the case, extremely stringent measures can be employed
by the Parties. In both the Single Convention and the Vienna
Convention provisions exist that enable the Parties to 'adopt
more strict or severe measures than those provided for by the
convention if, in [their] opinion, such measures are desirable or
necessary to prevent or suppress illicit trafficking'
([77]International Narcotics Control Board 1992, p4). Civil
penalty option. As described earlier, this policy option removes
criminal penalties for personal use activities such as possession
and instead imposes civil penalties - most commonly fines.
Australia ratified the Vienna Convention after consultations with
the States to ensure that legislation in all jurisdictions
conformed with treaty obligations. </p>

<p> While some commentators ([78]Fox &amp; Mathews 1992) argue
that civil penalties such as those provided in the South
Australian legislation represent a minor breach of international
treaty obligations, this does not appear to be the view of the
Commonwealth or of other commentators. There appear to be no
international law impediments to the civil penalty approach. </p>

<h3>Partial prohibition. </h3>

<p> As described by the [79]Sackville Royal Commission (South
Australia 1978), partial prohibition distinguishes between
trafficking in cannabis and activities associated with personal
use such as possession. Partial prohibition would remove all
penalties, both civil and criminal, in respect of personal use
and possession activities. These activities would no longer be
criminal offences. The removal of offences and penalties for
personal use and possession activities can be seen as
inconsistent with the conventions. Such a conclusion might be
reached on an interpretation of the Single Convention along the
lines suggested by [80]Woltring (1990), and of the Vienna
Convention. </p>

<p> It can also be argued that partial prohibition can be
accommodated under the Conventions. The Sackville Royal
Commission (1979, p311) took this view in regard to the Single
Convention - on the basis that the Convention did not encompass
personal use and possession activities. Partial prohibition could
be reconciled with the Vienna Convention on the basis of two
interpretations. For those who take the view that the Vienna
Convention is a trafficking convention and that there is no
requirement that personal use and possession activities be
criminalised, there is no obstacle to partial prohibition. It
could also be argued that partial prohibition could encompass an
option where a criminal offence existed for personal use and
possession activities, but no criminal or civil penalties were
provided. The existence of a criminal offence would be a signal
of society's disapproval of cannabis use. Treatment, education,
rehabilitation or social reintegration could be provided instead
of criminal or civil penalties, it being up to State Parties to
determine whether these measures are provided administratively or
by statute. </p>

<h3>Regulatory option </h3>

<p> Regulatory options might include regulated commercial sale or
a government monopoly. In 1979 the Sackville Royal Commission
took the view that regulation could not be accommodated under the
Single Convention (p311). The advent of the AIDS epidemic and
concern about injecting drug use and disease transmission may
have contributed to recent interpretations of treaty obligations
that differ from this view. [81]Woltring (1990) states that it is
open to Parties, within the context of 'medical or scientific
purpose', to: </p>

<ul>
    <li>provide for the cultivation of cannabis by a government
        agency; </li>
    <li>provide for the manufacture of cannabis by a government
        agency or private concern under government licence; </li>
    <li>trade in and distribute cannabis through a government
        agency or private enterprise under government licence; </li>
    <li>'supply or dispense drugs to drug abusers or
        AIDS/Hepatitis B risk users under appropriate programs'
        (p20). </li>
</ul>

<p> He goes on to remark that 'While any Party could adopt such
options on the basis that they serve the medical or therapeutic
objective of treating drug addiction or abuse, the options could
not be adopted if their ultimate purpose was to enable
recreational use as distinct from medical or therapeutic use'
(p20). </p>

<p> Under [82]Woltring's model, regulation could co-exist with
treaty obligations, but only to a limited extent - within a
medical model. Supply or dispensation of drugs to drug users for
medical purposes is considerably easier to reconcile with treaty
obligations in the context of injecting drug use than in relation
to cannabis. It might be argued that high THC content of illicit
cannabis represented a health risk to users 3, that could be
overcome through regulated supply, or that separation of drug
markets would make it less likely that cannabis users would be
exposed to and thus move on to more dangerous drug use involving
injecting drugs. However, these propositions would be unlikely to
convince most governments or commentators. </p>

<h3>Free availability. </h3>

<p> This policy option could not be accommodated under the
Conventions and would place Australia in breach of its treaty
obligations. This discussion of international instruments
suggests that Australia has some flexibility in considering and
implementing policy options in the context of treaty obligations.
However, for some options it might be thought necessary to seek
amendments to the Conventions or, indeed, denounce them.4 </p>

<p> An important question to be answered is whether Australian
drug laws, so long dominated and directed by influences beyond
our shores, and so little attuned to Australia's own
circumstances, should continue to be determined externally. As
cautious an inquiry as the Williams Royal Commission commented,
in relation to the Single Convention, that the spirit and
intention of the treaty was 'a secondary matter in the sense that
Australia must first decide what is the correct domestic policy
and then shape its international course accordingly' (1980,
pC263). </p>
