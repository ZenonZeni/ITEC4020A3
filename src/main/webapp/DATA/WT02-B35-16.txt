SunShine gets FERC nod to enter Florida market

     SunShine Interstate Transmission has received FERC's blessing
to build a 145-mile natural gas pipeline into Florida that will
interconnect with a proposed 570-mile intrastate pipeline to be
built by its affiliate.
     The commission also approved the pipeline's levelized rates. The
rates are based on the ultimate capacity of the project, even though
it will be at only half of its proposed capacity for three years. Since
the pipeline will be charging only the base rate, the lack of
capacity for the first few years will result in under-recovery of its
levelized cost of service. FERC will allow SunShine to spread the
recovery of the under-recovered costs over the life of the project.
     This rate design will provide new pipelines with the opportunity
to compete with already established pipelines, Commissioner
Donald Santa said. "It's a way to avoid the potentially time-
consuming debate on whether future expansion costs should be
rolled-in or incremental," he added.
     The pipeline will serve customers on the Florida peninsula, an
area that  has only one established interstate pipeline, Florida Gas
Transmission. The increased competition will benefit the Florida
consumers, Commissioner James Hoecker added.

NGSA says power study skims over gas benefits

     The Natural Gas Supply Assn. (NGSA) has challenged the
findings in a report by a coal industry-backed group that finds coal
as the fuel of choice for the next century's new baseload electricity
generation.
     The study "fails to factor in the full costs of technologies that
would make coal's exhaust stream as clean as gas exhaust and
assumes that the current bias in environmental regulations will
continue to permit higher pollution levels from coal than from gas,"
said Bruce Craig, NGSA's director of environmental affairs.
     Energy Ventures Analysis prepared the study, "Fuel Choice for
New Electric Generating Capacity in the Next Century: Coal or
Natural Gas," for the Center for Energy and Economic Development,
a coalition of coal companies and railroads. The report finds that
while natural gas-based technologies are the economical choice for
new peaking load power plant capacity, coal is the cost-effective
fuel of choice for baseload capacity units, says a recent study by
Energy Ventures Analysis.
     The report determines that natural gas technologies have lower
capital and nonfuel operating costs than coal technologies, but coal-
based technologies "offer a significant delivered fuel price
advantage over its natural gas-based competitors to virtually any
power plant location." For baseload units, fuel costs are the largest
element of operating costs, making coal the most cost-effective fuel
of choice, the study says.
     Craig countered, "There's no need to make 'either-or' judgements
about fueling future electricity generation. Gas, oil and coal will all
play an important role." He added that the energy industry should
focus on policies that create market incentives for higher
efficiency, environmental stewardship and new technologies to keep
this country competitive.
     The overall goal, Craig said, should be that consumers get the
best package of fuel, jobs and environmental benefits at the lowest
cost.
     The study says one reason coal is less expensive is because its
domestic supply is greater than the natural gas supply. At current
rates of consumption, the United States has about a 250-year
supply of recoverable coal reserves, which can be commercially
developed at current price levels, Energy Ventures Analysis
determines. For natural gas, reserves are more limited, possibly a
50-year supply, and are increasingly costly to develop, the study
says.
     However, NGSA said the study underestimates natural gas
reserves and fails to factor in the growing trend toward competition
in the electricity market.
     "The study inappropriately assumes that those working in the
electric generating field do not read market signals correctly and
do not use fuel supply, technology or market instruments that other
industries use," Craig noted.
     For an abstract or full text copy of the study, call the Center for
Energy and Economic Development office in Washington at 202-
628-5627.

May, June spot prices stay weak in light trading

     Many in the gas industry began stretching the three-day holiday
weekend into four days by taking off all or part of last Friday, so
trading was light for both May and June supplies.
     May prices in South Louisiana changed little for deals done
Friday morning, but prices in South Texas dropped into the mid- to
high-$1.50s into Natural Gas Pipeline of America (NGPL), Koch
Gateway Pipeline, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Trunkline Gas.
     Very few deals were reported done Friday for June, but there
were no signs of a recovery in spot prices. One source reported a
sale into Texas Gas Transmission (TGT) in zone SL at $1.71. The gas
is baseloaded from Thursday through the rest of the month.
     All three nuclear plants operated by Arizona Public Service are
scheduled to be operating by tomorrow, but they will run at less
than full capacity for the rest of the year.
     Palo Verde Unit 3, which has been down for refueling, is
scheduled to start up tomorrow. All three of Palo Verde's 1,270 MW
plants will then be generating electricity.
     But the units won't run any higher than 86% of capacity because
of potential problems with the tubes that carry steam up through
the boilers. The steam turns turbines to generate electricity. Small
cracks have appeared in the tubes, said a source at the utility.
     During periods of peak electrical demand, the utility will burn
natural gas to generate electricity or buy power from other
companies, he said.

June market leaves many unanswered questions

     A lot of questions will begin to be answered today and tomorrow,
but weather will set the tone for prices throughout the month.
     How much gas was sold swing? How many buyers, particularly
the big guys, the LDCs, held off buying until after the first of the
month? How will the nuclear plants near Houston and Dallas
perform after being restarted?
     Not to mention shut-ins. Is gas being shut in because of price or
because of no market? Will producers voluntarily shut in enough
gas to have an impact on prices? And lastly, is it ever going to get
hot and muggy in Texas?
     Beginning with the last question, a couple of sources said TU
Electric in the Dallas area is expecting temperatures in North
Texas to move into the 90s this week and is asking suppliers to be
prepared to ship gas. Temperatures in Oklahoma, likewise, are
expected to move into the 90s today, if not yesterday.
     TU Electric also operates the Comanche Peak nuclear plant where
Unit Two is out of service to repair cracked welds. A two-week
delay in the restart date has been penciled in, indicating a restart
around mid-June.
     As reported, TU burns nuclear and lignite as baseload and uses
gas for peaking needs. But the lignite units are running at maximum
levels now, said one source, which is why TU is preparing to call on
gas if temperatures rise.
     Unit Two at the South Texas Nuclear Plant near Houston was
running at 12% of capacity last Friday morning and was expected to
put electricity onto the grid system on Sunday or yesterday. It
could be at 100% of capacity in the first or second week this month.
     Only one June deal was reported on Friday, a large package at
the Katy Interchange on an intrastate pipeline at $1.65, down a
penny on the low end from Thursday's range of $1.66-70.
     May intrastate prices fell below $1.60 in South Texas and below
$1.40 in West Texas. Producers had little fight left in them to
quibble over a few pennies for a period of a few days. They wanted
gas to flow and were afraid there'd be no market at all over the
light-demand holiday weekend.

Texaco to cut staff at Henry Plant

     Texaco will eliminate 32 of 70 jobs at its Henry Plant, near
Erath, La., and the Henry Hub, by the end of the year, the company
told Gas Daily.
     The reduction in the workforce is required because of changing
operations at the facility, a spokesperson said. Texaco will no
longer be processing liquids at the plant.
     The company said liquids extraction is unprofitable in the
current low-price environment for natural gas liquids. In addition,
gas delivered to the hub usually does not need processing.
     Operations at the hub itself are not affected, said Jagit Yadov,
president of Texaco's Sabine Pipeline, operator of the Henry Hub.

Midcoast to build New York pipeline

     Midcoast Energy Resources is staking out new turf, constructing
a natural gas pipeline in Bethlehem, N.Y., to serve the Owens-
Corning Del Mar plant.
     This 3 million cf system will be the first New York project for
Midcoast, a Corpus Christi, Texas-based company that has
primarily served industrial end-users in the Midwest and Gulf
Coast.
     The system is slated for completion by June 30, and will include
interconnect facilities with an existing pipeline owned by
Tennessee Gas Pipeline.
     "Midcoast continues to pursue significant opportunities to
provide gas transportation services to industrial customers at
substantial discounts from their present suppliers," Midcoast
President Dan Tutcher said.
     Fiscal year 1993 revenues for publicly held Midcoast were about
$16 million. Midcoast also serves the Owens Corning Fiberglass
Plant in Kansas City, Kansas.

TransCanada forms Mexican partnership

     TransCanada PipeLines and Corporacion Gutsa, one of Mexico's
leading construction companies, have signed a letter of
understanding for joint efforts in a variety of projects in Mexico.
     "We intend to work together with Gutsa in the areas of power
generation facilities and the supply, distribution and
commercialization of natural gas in Mexico," said Gerald Maier,
TransCanada's chairman.
     The Mexican ambassador to Canada, Sandra Fuentes-Berain, said
the partnership is evidence of the success of the North American
Free Trade Agreement.
     TransCanada also has revised its 1995-96 facilities construction
application to the Canadian National Energy Board (NEB). The
pipeline is seeking approval to build 16.8 miles of line in Ontario
and Manitoba and a 28 MW compressor in Ontario.
     This is in addition to the 17.3 miles of line and 42.3 MW of
compression included in the earlier application. Total cost of all
the projects is estimated at C$189.3 million.
     If approved by the NEB, TransCanada plans to begin construction
in 1995 and put the facilities into service by Nov. 1 next year.
     The new facilities would add 88.8 million cfd of firm, long-haul
capacity to the pipeline.

Industry, FERC agree to keep recovery mechanism

     Industry and FERC apparently see eye-to-eye about keeping
intact the pricing differential mechanism that pipelines use to
recover gas supply realignment (GSR) costs.
     Industry participants assembled at a technical conference in
Washington last week to voice general approval of the recovery
mechanism. FERC commissioners seemed to agree that the two-year
recovery program should not be altered.
     Order 636 required pipelines to reform their contracts to
market levels or terminate them altogether. The rule provided for
recovery of the costs associated with realigning the bundled-sales
contracts. The commission determined last year, in various cases,
that it would permit pipelines to collect the difference between the
market price and the price established in their contracts as a
recovery mechanism for the GSR costs. The mechanism has been in
place for only 11 months of its proposed two-year period.
     Customer complaints that pipelines were taking advantage of the
pricing mechanism prompted the commission to take a look at the
GSR recovery option, despite Commissioner Donald Santa's concern
that the commission was considering a "mid-stream change." The
customers were concerned that pipelines were getting windfall
profits through the mechanism.
     But many of the complaints were squelched before the
conference took place, after pipelines helped their customers
realize that the pricing differential recoveries would cost them less
than federally ordered buyouts of the contracts.      Many of the
customers simply didn't realize the trade-offs that the pipelines
have made on their costs, a representative of the Natural Gas Supply
Assn (NGSA) said. Some pipelines have eaten many of their
transition costs, the representative added.
     Nicholas Bush, president of NGSA, said the pricing differential
costs are part of larger compromise agreements negotiated between
pipelines and their customers. "Altering these compromises would
upset the balance of interests achieved in those original settlement
agreements," he said. "A change in course before the expiration of
this limited period, as some have suggested doing, would send a
confusing signal."
     Many of the pipelines noted in comments on the issue that most
of their contracts would be terminated by the end of the two-year
period.

Coastal to sell Argentine operations

     Coastal is selling its 23.33% interest in five producing oil and
natural gas fields and related facilities in Tierra del Fuego
province of Argentina for $68 million plus contingent
considerations.
     The sale will be to other joint-interest owners in the venture,
Coastal said. The transaction is subject to certain approvals and
will be completed next month.
     "This sale gives Coastal an attractive return on its initial
investment," said David Arledge, Coastal's president and COO. "At
the same time, it provides additional funds for other opportunities
the company currently has under review."
