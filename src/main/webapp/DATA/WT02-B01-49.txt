<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<h2>CLAIM V: THERE ARE NO COMPELLING MEDICAL REASONS TO PRESCRIBE
MARIJUANA OR HEROIN TO SICK PEOPLE. </h2>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>It is quite easy to refute this argument for both drugs. </p>

<p>Medically speaking, heroin is simply a stronger form of
morphine. Therefore, if there is a legitimate medical use for
morphine, then there is a legitimate medical use for heroin.
Heroin was once used medically in a manner similar to morphine
and was even used for pain relief during childbirth. Doctors
state that heroin is a good drug for medical use because it is
safe, powerful, and short acting. Recent research indicates that
pain-killers can be important healing agents after patients
undergo major surgery, because these drugs reduce the stress on
the central nervous system. In some cases, the amount of time
required to heal can be cut in half. Some research shows that the
best doses of morphine are perhaps ten times what they were
considered to be just a decade ago. </p>

<p>In the case of marijuana (hemp), there is already an approved
prescription drug, Marinol, which is derived from the primary
active ingredient in marijuana and used for the conditions for
which marijuana (hemp) is recommended. Marijuana (hemp) itself
would not be approved as a prescription drug because of FDA rules
which state that a medicine must consist of only the active
ingredients and a filler. Therefore, the rules themselves
prohibit the approval of any natural substances such as a plant,
even though the active ingredients in the plant and the
prescription drug are precisely the same. </p>

<p>The question then becomes, why should a sick person pay sixty
dollars a pill when they can grow the same medicine in their own
backyard for free? </p>

<p>Some patients report that the homegrown version of the
medicine is far superior to the prescription version for a couple
of reasons. One reason is that marijuana (hemp) is often used to
treat nausea and it is often hard to keep pills in their stomach
when they have nausea. Some of them have complained that it is
awfully depressing to vomit up a sixty dollar pill. Therefore, it
is better if the medicine is smoked because it bypasses the
stomach and gets the medicine into the body much more quickly.
Another reason that some sick people prefer marijuana (hemp) over
Marinol is that Marinol makes them &quot;higher than a
kite&quot;, and they don't want to be high, they just want their
medical symptoms relieved. By smoking marijuana (hemp), they can
limit the amount of &quot;high&quot; they get. </p>

<p>Marijuana (hemp) has traditionally been used in medicines for
thousands of years. Prior to 1937, it was the most common
agricultural crop in America and was used for literally thousands
of purposes, including rope, cloth, paper, fuel, and medicine. It
was prescribed for a wide variety of ailments and was included in
up to two-thirds of all over the counter preparations. Prior to
1937, cannabis (hemp) was completely unregulated and it would
have been impossible to regulate cannabis (hemp) because it was a
major agricultural crop grown nearly everywhere. Cannabis (hemp)
derivatives were included in a wide variety of items consumed by
the general public. Despite this widespread, unregulated
consumption, there were no reported problems. The American
Medical Association was opposed to the marijuana (hemp) laws in
1937 for these reasons. The promoters of these laws openly lied
about the AMA's attitude toward the law in order to get it
passed. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>It is often suggested that, even if currently controlled
substances are not made available to the general public, some of
them, particularly marijuana and heroin, could be used to relieve
suffering. </p>

<p>Participants in the AntiLegalization Forum acknowledged that
arguments urging the medical use of marijuana are often used as
an entree into the legalization debate. Medical use arguments can
garner public support because they seem harmless enough to the
uninformed audience. The experts agreed that these issues are
peripheral to the real issue. </p>

<p><img src="../graphics/goldline.gif" align="bottom" width="562"
height="19"><b>The Facts</b> </p>

<p>The DEA has no business making decisions or statements about
the proper medical use of anything. The fact that they do is only
one more example of what is wrong with our current drug policy. </p>

<p>There should be no argument at all that it is up to the
medical profession and its patients to define what is, or is not,
a proper medical treatment. The police do not have the required
professional knowledge to determine proper medical uses, they do
not know what difficulties individual patients may face in their
treatment or what benefits patients might receive, and they care
even less. It is absurd to pretend that complex medical decisions
can be made for every patient in the United States by an
organization such as the DEA. </p>

<p>The problem goes beyond the illegal drugs such as marijuana
and heroin. The problem extends to pain killers of all types in
general. The severity of this problem was seen in the recent case
of Florida versus Martinez. </p>

<p>Mr. Martinez was a lay AIDS counselor who ran a drug buyers
club for AIDS patients. A drug buyers club purchases medical
drugs which are available in other countries but not in the
United States and distributes them to sick people here. Mr.
Martinez was charged with distributing morphine without medical
training or a license. </p>

<p>Mr. Martinez did not deny the fact that he distributed
morphine to people and that he was in violation of the drug laws.
His only defense was that his actions were a medical necessity,
because of the barbaric policies of the DEA against people who
were in pain. The defense brought forth experts who testified how
the DEA had prosecuted and imprisoned doctors for prescribing
Tylenol 3 -- Tylenol with codeine -- a drug which is not even a
prescription drug except in the United States and South Africa,
and the US is the only control in the world which has ever sent a
doctor to prison for prescribing it. They testified about AIDS
patients who suffer from a nerve degeneration all over their body
which makes them scream in pain every time they are even touched.
For many of them, a simple bath can be painful beyond belief, and
yet they cannot get pain medication because their doctors are
often afraid to prescribe it because they fear what the DEA could
do to them. </p>

<p>After the jury heard the evidence on the government's drug
policy, they voted unanimously for acquittal. This trial was
shown on Court TV and has been repeated many times because it is
one of the most interesting trials they have ever shown. </p>

<p><b>DEA Statement</b> </p>

<p>The medical pros and cons of prescribing marijuana and heroin
to sick people are best debated by medical professionals. It
should be kept in mind, however, that marijuana has been rejected
as medicine by the American Medical Society, the American
Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the
International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, and the
American Cancer Society. </p>

<p>HHS report </p>

<p>Not one American health association accepts marijuana as
medicine. Statements issued by these organizations express
concern over the harmful effects of the drugs and over the lack
of solid research demonstrating that they might do more good than
harm. </p>

<p>The International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies,
for instance, said in a statement issued by its Therapeutic
Claims Committee in 1992: &quot;Further studies are required to
determine whether marijuana has a clinically useful effect on
multiple sclerosis. In view of the possible toxic effects of
longterm use, its use cannot be recommended. In the opinion of
the committee, there appears to be no generally accepted
scientific basis for use of this therapy. It has never been
tested in a properly controlled trial. Longterm use may be
associated with significant serious side effects.&quot; </p>

<p>Some facts which help to confirm the observations of the forum
participants may be used in debates: </p>

<p>· Under the federal statute known as the Controlled
Substances Act, regulated drugs are divided into categories known
as schedules. In Schedule I, for instance, are drugs with a high
potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in
treatment in the United States. At the other end of the spectrum
is Schedule V, which is for drugs that have a low potential for
abuse and have a currently accepted medical use in treatment in
the United States. The Act provides a mechanism for substances to
be controlled (added to a schedule), decontrolled (removed from
control), or rescheduled (transferred from one schedule to
another). </p>

<p>Heroin and marijuana are in Schedule I; cocaine, which is
sometimes used as a local anesthetic, is in Schedule II. Much of
the debate about medical uses for currently illegal drugs
concerns substituting heroin for morphine and supplying marijuana
to AIDS and glaucoma patients or using it to treat side effects
of chemotherapy. </p>

<p>· A petition to put marijuana in a less restrictive schedule
of the CSA was rejected by then DEA Administrator John C. Lawn,
after public hearings, on December 29, 1989. The United States
Court of Appeals ordered further proceedings, however, to clear
up what it felt were some ambiguities in the record.
Administrator Robert C. Bonner, who succeeded Lawn, complied and
issued a new ruling on March 26, 1992. &quot;By any modern
scientific standard, marijuana is no medicine, &quot; Bonner
said. The three judge appeals court upheld the ruling unanimously
on February 18, 1994. &quot;Our review of the record convinces us
that the Administrator's findings are supported by substantial
evidence,&quot; the court said, noting the &quot;testimony of
numerous experts that marijuana' s medicinal value has never been
proven in sound scientific studies.&quot; <br>
