<DL>
<DT><H2>Introduction</H2></DT>
<DD>
Elev calculates an elevation from an unwrapped phase file. The elevation file
will have the same geolocation and geometry information as the unwrapped
phase file.
<P>
To use th elev program, you will also need a baseline file (see <a
href="resolve.html">resolve</a> or <a href="refine.html">refine_base</a>), the
CEOS metadata files, and a masking file that indicates how the phase was
unwrapped.  If you are using the ASF/STEP interferometry software, <a
href="escher.html"> escher</a> creates, along with the unwrapped phase, a
masking file.  If you do not have a masking file, you can create one.  (See <a
href="#create">below</a>.)  Elev only generates height values for those pixels
that have been unwrapped.  All other values are set to -1.

<DT><A NAME="create"><H2>Creating a Mask File</H2></DT>
<DD>
A mask file is a two dimensional array of unsigned char bytes with the same
dimensions as the unwrapped phase file..  During the unwrapping process bits are
continually set and unset.  For each phase pixel, elev checks to see if the
corresponding mask pixel is set as an unwrapped pixel.  If you do not have a
mask file, you can just create one in which every pixel has the correct bit set.
<P>
The value you need to set each pixel is 0x10 hex (16 decimal).  If you do this,
every pixel will get a height value calculated including the non-integrated
points. Bad data will not be set to -1 for elev will believe all the data is
good data.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>
<DD>
As far as the ASF/STEP interferometry software is concerned, creating an
elevation file is the last step.  However, as a researcher and investigator, you
will probably want to continue processing your new elevation file.  For
instance, if you are using ASF data, all your images are in slant range.  They
need to be corrected to ground range and eventually placed in a map projection.
While the members of STEP are looking into this process, we do not have software
available yet to help you.  However, do not let this discourage you.
Interferometry can be exciting as well as infuriating.  And if you do design
software or have a suggestion, please let us know.  We would like to incorporate
whatever ideas or code you have into the interferometry software.
