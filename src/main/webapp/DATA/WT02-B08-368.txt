<h2 align=center> Religion Oozes from Public Education  </h2>
The law says that prayer is not allowed in the public school and neither is the teaching of God's Word, because there must be a separation between church and state. Your child or children are not allowed to be taught the Judeo Christian beliefs in the public school because it is considered a religion. Yet, do you know that two U.S. Supreme Court decisions (Torcaso vs. Watkins 367 US 488 [1961] and U.S. vs. Seeger 380 US 163 [1964]), expressly acknowledge humanism's religious nature. This religion has not been banned from the public school system, it has only been promoted and incorporated more earnestly. Thus the result is that the religion of humanism and relativism is oozing from today's educational system.
<p> Why is the curriculum, programs and techniques that we have looked at been permitted to be implemented, much less paid for by federal dollars. Such programs are purposely being used to advance a certain belief or doctrine to children, that is absolutely contrary to the beliefs of that childs parents. Not only is this wrong morally, but it is controdictory to the parents constitutional rights based on the parent-child relationship. The United States Supreme Court handed down a discision in the case of Edwards V. Aquillard (1987) 482 U.S. 578, 583-584 that said. "Families entrust schools with the education of their children, but condition their trust on the understanding that the classroom will not purposely be used to advance religious views that may conflict with the pirvate beliefs of the student and his or her family."
