<H2>
A New Year. A New Look.
</h2>

Your ActionLetter has undergone a makeover as NewsNet moves forward toward the next millennium.  Our goal was to streamline the ActionLetter and make it quicker and easier for you to spot information of interest.  For example, instead of paging through the "News on NewsNet," there's now a single tear-off sheet with new titles bolded for instant recognition of new sources.  Simply detach this sheet and place within easy view for quick reference.<P>

Another goal was to be a good neighbor and save some of our favorite trees by requiring our new design eliminate the need for mailing envelopes.<P>

The ActionLetter is your monthly information update from NewsNet and therefore we welcome your comments, suggestions and questions (Call Sandy Schulman at 1-800-952-0122 or send e-mail to sandy@newsnet.com.)  Please don't hesitate to tell us what's of interest to you and what's not, what you want more or less of, and how we can serve you better.  You're very important to us and we want you to be delighted with NewsNet!<P>
