<p> UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES </p>

<p> CONSTITUENT ELECTRONIC MAIL SYSTEM </p>

<p> We welcome your inquiry to the House of Representatives
Constituent Electronic Mail System. Currently, fifty Members of
the U.S. House of Representatives have been assigned public
electronic mailboxes that may be accessed by their constituents.
The nature and character of the incoming electronic mail has
demonstrated that this capability will be an invaluable source of
information on constituent opinion. We are now in the process of
expanding the project to other Members of Congress, as technical,
budgetary and staffing constraints allow. </p>

<p> Because this program is intended to provide an additional
vehicle for Members to communicate with their constitutents, it
is critical that you include your name and address in your mail
message, preferably at the top of the message. Most Congressional
offices have adequate staff resources to respond only to their
constituents and your inclusion of your full name and mailing
address will insure that your Member can identify your residence
within his or her Congressional District. A number of House
committees and leadership offices have also been assigned public
electronic mailboxes. The names and electronic mailbox addresses
of these offices are listed below after the information about
participating Representatives. </p>

<p> The Document Room of the U.S. House of Representatives has
also been assigned an electronic public mailbox. The name and
electronic mailbox address of the House Document Room is listed
below after the information about participating committees. The
House Document room distributes House Bills, Resolutions,
Reports, Documents, and Public Laws for the 104th Congress. House
Reports, Documents, and Public Laws for the 103rd Congress are
also maintained. The public can obtain 2 copies of up to 12
different House documents per day. Customers should include their
telephone number with their mailing address. All document orders
will be filled and mailed the same day they are received. For
more detailed information or questions, call the Document Room at
(202) 225-3456, Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Please
review the list of participating Representatives below, and if
the Congressional District in which you reside is listed, follow
the instructions to begin communicating by electronic mail with
your epresentative. If your Representative is not yet on-line,
please be patient. </p>

<p> INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONSTITUENTS </p>

<p> The list above includes the electronic mail addresses of
Members </p>

<p> who are participating in the program. The primary goal of
this program </p>

<p> constituents who communicate with their Representative by
electronic </p>

<p> mail should be aware that Members will sometimes respond to
their </p>

<p> messages by way of the U.S. Postal Service. This method of
reply </p>

<p> will help to insure confidentiality, a concern that is of
utmost </p>

<p> importance to the House of Representatives. </p>
