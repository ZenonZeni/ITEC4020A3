          *  The report abstract should provide a one- to two-page 
summary of the Phase I
             project, including a general description of the project 
approach, members of the
             consortium, and results.  Include the title of the 
application at the top of the
             summary.  The abstract may be publicly released by DOE and 
should not contain
             any information that is considered proprietary or 
confidential.
