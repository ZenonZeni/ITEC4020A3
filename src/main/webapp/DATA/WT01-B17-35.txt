<P>How would you like to raise your HDL and lower your LDL with almost every
meal you consume? You don't have to remember to take it and you don't have to
measure amounts: it's a food you would normally use on a daily basis.

<P>Any health researcher will tell you that it's hard to come by a product,
especially an everyday household oil, that both raises HDL and lowers LDL.
Grapeseed oil, brand new on the American scene, does just that. Dr. David Nash,
research cardiologist at the SUNY Science Center in New York, published a study
in Arteriosclerosis, revealing the beneficial HDL-effect of grapeseed oil. The
research shows that just one ounce daily is all that is necessary for this
beneficial outcome.

<P>According to both the Helsinki and Framingham Heart Studies performed on
thousands of patients over several years, each percentage increase in HDL affects a very
significant decrease in the incidence of cardiac events. As a bonus, triglycerides
also decrease. A second report recently confirmed Nash's findings, adding that
grapeseed oil reduced LDL in just three weeks.

<P>To the best of current knowledge, grapeseed oil, a high linoleic product, is the
only food known to raise HDL and lower LDL. Linoleic acid is one of two essential
fatty acids that you cannot manufacture yourself - you must eat it! You may know
linoleic acid as Omega 6. Studies indicate that linoleic is sadly deficient in our
diets. Grapeseed oil is 76-percent linoleic acid!

<P>Low levels of HDL are also related to impotence. In fact, the results of the
Massachusetts Male Aging Study show that as HDL levels decrease, the probability of
impotence increases. (See details of this study in<I>Health Updates,</I>page 9.)

<P>
Grapeseed oil is now available for all forms of cooking and is also ideal for salad
dressings and mayonnaise. It has no fatty after taste and brings out the flavor of
food, so it can be used for anything from an everyday tuna salad to delicate culinary
party preparations. It has a non-greasy, slightly nutty flavor and will not cloud when
chilled.

<P>When used for regular or deep frying at normal temperatures, its unusually-high
smoke point, over 485 degrees F, means no smoking, no splattering, no burnt taste. Best
of all, there is no conversion to the harmful trans-fatty acids as with other oils. 
Naturally high in vitamin E, maximum benefit can be obtained by using it raw. The
presence of vitamin E also graces grapeseed oil with a shelf life of at least two years.

<P>
<B>Editor's note:</B>
<I>Our research shows that grapeseed oil is best for heart-health. Olive oil rates next,
followed by canola oil.
