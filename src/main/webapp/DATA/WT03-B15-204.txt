<H1>University of Plymouth: The Foundation Of a New Course - BSc Robotics & Automation Systems</H1> 
</HEAD>

<H2>Workspace user profile</H2>
<P>The University of Plymouth is the first UK university to offer a course in Robotics & Automation Systems. The course has been developed to address the need for graduate engineers with a good knowledge of automated manufacturing systems.</P>

<H2>The challenge</H2>
<P>An essential theme in the course is that of practical "hands-on" experience of robots. The University currently has eleven small educational robots and an industrial ABB IRB1000.</P>

<p>To date, students have had to work in teams, having access to the robots only during laboratory sessions. Clearly more industrial robots had to be made available to provide students with the necessary access to modern robotic hardware. An ideal solution would be to provide each student with their own robot, which they could use at any time in complete safety.</P>

<P>The prohibitive cost of industrial robots is only the first barrier to the undertaking of such a course. Student safety is also a prime consideration. Additional staff would be needed to supervise laboratory sessions and access at other times would be impossible.</P>

<H2>The solution</H2>
<P>Combining practical laboratory sessions with Workspace provided the answer. The simulation system is now used as the foundations for all robotic modules on the course. Students may use Workspace to load a model of an industrial robot, create a workcell using the integrated CAD system and write robot programs. This can be done at any time of the day using one of the University's PCs.</P>

<P>Students may even construct their own mechanisms in Workspace and experiment with different controller parameters, plotting graphs to show the effect on robot dynamics.</P>

<P>Simulated robotic projects can be developed in complete safety. In addition, the newly introduced Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) features in Workspace have enabled the creation of interactive training exercises by course tutors.</P>

<P>The University now intends to start an active Workspace users group which will pool CAL material world-wide from a wide range of institutions.</P>

<H2>Benefits</H2>
<P>Savings on robotic hardware allowed more students to enrol</P>
<P>Use of simulation software made the course more attractive to prospective students</P>
<P>Safety problems were overcome</P>
<P>Students could apply newly learnt principles outside of laboratory sessions</P>

<H2>The University's financial justification for Workspace</H2>

<P>Establishment of the course would not have been possible without a simulation system</P>

<P>Workspace provides the best possible price/performance ratio</P>

<P>Academic staff were free to concentrate on teaching rather than safety supervision</P>
