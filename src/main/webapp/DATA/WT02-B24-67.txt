<h2>Advocacy Memo: For Your Information #1 - 96</h2>
<p>
<b>Denial of Eligibility Because of Gifted Intellectual Ability and/or Lack
of Failure </b><br>
The U.S. Department of Education, in a written response to questions from the
Learning Disabilities Association of North Carolina, stated that "...each
child who is evaluated for a suspected learning disability must be measured
against his or her own expected performance, and not against some arbitrary
general standard." As required by Part B regulation (34 CFR §§300.540-300.543),
the multidisciplinary evaluation team is responsible for determining if a
severe discrepancy exists between a student's ability and performance.
Under
Part B of IDEA and Part B regulations there are no "exclusions based on
intelligence level in determining eligibility." <i>In other words, a
student cannot be excluded from consideration of eligibility for special
education services solely on the basis of a high IQ; no child's IQ can be
too high for that child to be considered for eligibility for special education
services -- even an intellectually gifted student may be considered for
eligibility for special education. </i>

<p>
In order to qualify as having a specific learning disability, the student,
according to Part B of IDEA and Part B regulations, must have a severe
discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability "in one of more
of the following areas: oral expression, listening comprehension, written
expression, basic reading skill, reading comprehension, mathematics 
calculation, or mathematics reasoning." <i>Intellectual ability is
determined by administration of intelligence or IQ test(s). Achievement is 
determined by administration of tests designed to measure basic reading skill
and comprehension, math computational and reasoning skills, and the ability of
the child to express his/her ideas in writing. Oral expression and listening 
comprehension are generally determined by giving speech and language
tests. Scores earned on achievement and IQ tests are then compared.</i> 

<p>
In order to be eligible for special education services, the multidisciplinary 
team must determine if the student has an "impairment" or disability which 
"adversely affects educational performance" 34 CFR §300.7 (b) (1) - (b)
(13). In a letter to William M. Lybarger, Ed.D., dated September 14, 1990, 
the Department of Education described "educational performance" as
different for each child, "determined on an individual basis," and
"includ(ing) non-academic and academic skills." <i>In other words, a
student with suspected learning disabilities must <b>need</b> special 
education and related services in order to qualify for those services. </i>

<p>
A multidisciplinary team may find a child has a specific learning disability 
if "the child does not achieve commensurate with his or her age and 
ability levels in one or more of the areas listed in paragraph (a) (2) of 
this section, <b>when provided with learning experiences appropriate for the
child's age and ability levels</B> ..." 34 CFR §300.541 (a) (1). The
Department of Education, in its letter to LDA of North Carolina, wrote that
it is "generally" appropriate for the multidisciplinary team to include in
its written report (to determine eligibility) information regarding
"outside or extra" instructional help or support which <b>"may indicate
the child's current educational achievements reflects the service 
augmentation, not what the child's achievement would be without such
help."</b> Such information should be considered by the team in deciding if
the child has "a severe discrepancy between achievement and ability that
is not correctable without special education and related services." If,
for example, a student with an IQ of 125 and significantly lower achievement
scores maintains passing or even exemplary grades, the team should consider
whether or not the student achieves only because of special assistance or
support. If the student receives no special help, the multidisciplinary team
might conclude that student would not need special education. If, on the other
hand, the student has tutoring several times a week, works for three to five 
hours each night on homework with parental assistance, and must have extra 
time to complete tests in order to pass or maintain a certain grade level, 
that student might be considered to have a "specific learning disability." 
His/her grades may reflect all the assistance the student is getting rather 
than the student's actual achievement level.
