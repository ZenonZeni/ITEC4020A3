 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THE BRAIN </H2>


<P>  Mankind has long been fascinated by that gray, wrinkled matter contained within our skulls. Just as the heart, liver or stomach has been thought of as the seat of the emotions in various cultures, so also the brain has been regarded as the seat of intelligence.</P>
<P>  What we eat can affect our moods, mental alertness and memory causing much interest and research in brain function related to special nutrients in recent years.</P>
<P>  The brain is a complicated, well organized matrix of intricate nerve endings connecting each brain cell with many others. Billions of electrical nerve impulses travel back and forth within the brain every second. Many chemicals act as neurotransmitters that transport these impulses from one cell to another. If the brain has an inadequate  supply  of the  nutrients  it  needs  to manufacture these substances, it will be hindered in its ability to function properly.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> ALZHEIMER'S</H2>
<P>  Malfunctions of the brain seem to be an increasing problem in western societies today with Alzheimer's Disease being one of the most common and most serious. It is the fourth leading cause of death among adults with about 100,000 deaths annually.  It afflicts between 2.5 and 4 million Americans and it is predicted to rise to 14 million victims in the year 2040. At age 65, your chance of getting Alzheimer's is 6%, at 75 it is 20% and is an incredible 47% at age 85. The disease begins with early confusion and progresses to the point of major forgetfulness, incontinence, difficult sleeping and major personality changes. Then, just about all motor activity is lost to the point of not being able to even eat without help.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SPECIAL FORMULA</H2>
<P>  This unique herbal based product contains the special Hyperizia Serrata, Gota Kola and Ginkgo Biloba concentrate plus Ginseng herbs. In addition, it contains the very special valuable amino acids L-Glutamine, L-Taurine,  L-Tyrosine  plus  N-Acetyl  Carnitine. Go-Enzyme Q-10 is included because of its fantastic anti-oxidant effect. FOOD FOR THOUGHT provides the nutrients specifically synergistic for support of healthy brain function.  Many individuals find FOOD FOR THOUGHT helpful for alertness and stamina.</P>
<P>  The amino acids in FOOD FOR THOUGHT serve as precursors, which the brain needs to produce important neurotransmitter serotonin. If inadequate amounts of these types of amino acids are not in the diet, too little serotonin is produced causing you to become nervous or have trouble sleeping.</P>
<P>  L-Glutamine is an amino acid that penetrates the barrier separating the brain from the rest of the body's circulatory system. Once inside the brain, L-Glutamine has the unusual ability to provide fuel for brain cells. Consequently, it is an energy source for the brain and has been used to improve learning and I.Q. Some alcoholics have been helped dramatically by L-Glutamine supplements.  Even though the body manufactures its own Glutamine, some people seem to need more than they can produce by themselves and supplementation is needed.</P>
<P>  Tyrosine is a precursor to Norepinephrine and Dopamine (two important neurotransmitters) in the brain that are excitatory and seem to keep you alert, sexually interested and ambitious.   Dopamine is deficient in people with Parkinson's disease.  Results are now becoming apparent about the nutritional value of Tyrosine in the prevention of depression.</P>
<P>  FOOD FOR THOUGHT contains the special nutrients for those who desire to keep an alert mind and a sharp memory. Some of them have been well known in other cultures for centuries and some are just now becoming understood. This formula is great for students, absent-minded professors and the elderly. Many believe the herbs and other nutrients help to prevent feelings of being depressed and nutritionally supports those who want to stay alert without resorting to caffeine or other harmful stimulants.</P>
