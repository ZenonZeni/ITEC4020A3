PRU-BACHE DRIVES MORTGAGE ANALYTICS
WITH INTEL'S iPSC/860 SUPERCOMPUTER

Prudential Bache Securities Inc. is retooling its fixed income
analytics desk around Intel Corp.'s newly-announced iPSC/860
supercomputer. The new parallel-processing supercomputer, which
was unveiled at the World Trade Center on Jan. 8, utilizes up to
128 of Intel's high-performance, 64-bit i860 microprocessors and
can deliver up to 7.6 billion floating point operations per
second (GFlops).

  About a dozen of Pru-Bache's 400 traders and salesmen currently
have access to applications running on an iPSC/2, a precursor of
the new iPSC/860. "Over the next six to 12 months, all
parallelizable, cpu-consumptive applications will be
parallelized, and a large number of our traders and salesmen will
be using them," says Vincent Pica, managing director of Pru-
Bache's financial strategies group.

  The IPSC/2, an 80386-based supercomputer, was installed at the
investment firm's New York office in mid-1989. In April, the
IPSC/2 will be upgraded to performance levels of the new
iPSC/860. The upgrade will result in a iPSC/2-860 hybrid, one
that uses eight i860s and 24 386 chips.

  In parallel processing computers, problems are divided into
many parts and executed simultaneously, resulting in execution
times that far surpass serial or batch processing methods.

  Pru-Bache claims it is the first securities firm to use the new
generation of supercomputers from Intel. The new machines are the
first commercial products resulting from the joint Intel-DARPA
(Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) Touchstone project.
Seeking to set new standards for supercomputer performance,
Touchstone hopes to develop a 2000 processor, 150-GFlop machine
by 1992.

  The air-cooled iPSC/860 machine, with anywhere from eight to
128 microprocessors, ranges in price from $265,000 to $3.5
million. Intel claims that the new machine out-price-performs a
comparable Y-MP supercomputer from Cray Research Inc. by a factor
of 10.

  Pru-Bache has been using the iPSC/2 machine as a server on its
ethernet network which also links IBM mainframes, Digital
Equipment Corp. VAX minicomputers and Sun Microsystems Inc.
workstations. The initial applications fitted to the
supercomputer have been geared toward the firm's mortgage-backed
securities trading business, but future developments will address
government and corporate bond analysis needs.

  Current applications running on the iPSC/2 include the creation
of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and predictive
performance analysis. "There is an evolving need on the part of
sophisticated clients to know how these securities will act over
a wider range of interest-rate scenarios, requiring more fire
power," says Pica. Last year Pru-Bache created over $13 billion
worth of "engineered" securities, he says.

  The high-speed capability of the Intel machine has prompted
Pru-Bache to take on more arcane and computationally intensive
functions, such as the tax arbitrage associated with CMO
residuals. "Without the arbitrage values, while [an issue] may
have a high yield before tax, it may have a very low yield after
tax," Pica says.

  After-tax residual calculations that once took 20 minutes to
execute on the firm's DEC VAX now take 90 seconds on the Intel
iPSC/2. And converting the residual program to run in the
supercomputer's parallel processing environment required only 40
lines of code.

  The supercomputer is also being used to speed programs used in
the analysis of adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. All
the required software conversion -- including the development of
parallel scheduling algorithms that allow multiple users to
interact with the iPSC/2 simultaneously -- has been performed
collectively by Pru-Bache and Intel.

  Along with its low price, Intel hopes to win customers by
covering all the compatibility bases. The iPSC/860 purportedly
can be linked to DEC VAX, IBM and/or UNIX-based environments.
TCP/IP and ethernet standards are also supported. The iPSC/860 is
available with up to 2 gigabytes of RAM. Disk storage in excess
of 100 gigabytes can be linked to the machine.

  "With any parallel computer that's new, regardless of who the
vendor is, you have the potential of being left high and dry with
the technology," says William Anderson, executive vice president
of information systems at Pru-Bache. He adds: "With Intel, at
least from a chip point of view, they control the chip that makes
it all happen. "

  "We were familiar with [Intel's] management through previous
associations," adds Pica. "We were impressed by their involvement
with DARPA...and Intel had a natural advantage being the
manufacturer of the both the 386 and 860 chip."

REUTERS TRADING SYSTEMS EXEC
DEPARTS AFTER TRIARCH FIASCO

  Reuters Holdings PLC and Mario Rosi, its global product group
leader for trading room systems, have gone their separate ways.
The break comes in the wake of the recent collapse of Reuters'
bid to install its TRIARCH 2000 digital data distribution system
at National Westminster Bank (TST, Oct. 9, 1989).

  Rosi's departure was expected for some time -- the final straw
being the Nat West fiasco, sources say. Revenues at Reuters' Rich
subsidiary are said to have gone from about $150 million in 1987
to $50 million in 1989. The 1989 total is said to include
continuing service contract revenues of about $25 million, but
not PRISM revenue because it isn't a U.S.-developed product.

  Rosi was replaced by David Morgan, formerly Reuters'
international marketing manager for trading room systems and
Rosi's subordinate. Morgan could not be reached for comment.

  Morgan's ascendance is said by insiders at Reuters to be a blow
for Rich president Peter Leger. Like Rosi, Morgan will be based
in London and report to David Ure, managing director of Reuters
Europe, Middle East and Africa Ltd. As a product group leader,
Morgan will also report to Andre Villeneuve, who chairs
Reuters'international product planning committee in addition to
his regional management responsibilities.

  Sources say part of the reason Leger was passed over was that
Ure wasn't willing to let North American management gain control
of another product group. John Hull is product group leader for
transactional services, and Buford Smith is product group leader
for real time information.

                       An Amicable Parting

  A spokesman in Reuters' London office stated last week that
Rosi "had resigned, effective immediately, for personal reasons."
Sources at Reuters say the senior executive was offered the
position of director of operations in Italy, an offer he flatly
refused.

  Reached by phone at his London home, Rosi corroborated Reuters'
statement, saying that circumstances surrounding his departure
were "totally" amicable. Asked if the failure of Triarch 2000 in
any way contributed to his motives for leaving, he said "not at
all....I decided the time was right to take on something new,
different and more challenging." Rosi says he is looking into
"several options" for employment in the industry, including
"setting up my own company."

  Though Reuters would not elaborate on the details of Rosi's
departure, his Reuters stock holdings are likely to have been
considerable. Executives were given shares of Reuters stock
before the company went public; stock options have subsequently
been offered over the past few years. Rosi had been with Reuters
for 16 years.

SEC SAYS RMJ'S OPTIONS
SYSTEM IS NO EXCHANGE

  The Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that RMJ's
Over-the-Counter Options Trading System is not an exchange and
that Delta Government Options Corp., the system's clearing
agency, can operate as such.

  Last summer, the commission was ordered to define an exchange
by a Chicago federal appeals court which heard a case the Chicago
futures exchanges brought against the SEC (TST, Sept. 11, 1989).
The court opinion was a key event in the futures exchanges'
sustained legal campaign against the RMJ system, which they
viewed as a competitive market.

  A spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange says the
exchange "will review the SEC rule and consult with the Chicago
Board of Trade on future action we would take, if any." A CBOT
official says the exchange won't decide what to do until the SEC
issues an official order, expected this week.

  The uninterrupted operation of RMJ's system hinged on the
commission's ruling. Had the commission ruled that the system was
an exchange subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
operation of RMJ and Delta might have been temporarily stopped
while appropriate registration was sought.

  The ruling also paves the way for action on the SEC's proposed
rule on proprietary trading systems (TST, Aug. 14, 1989), which
the commission had shelved while pondering the RMJ case. The
decision is likely to help sponsors of proprietary systems
understand what innovations they can and can't make.

  TST learned about key points discussed at the commission
hearing, held on Jan. 5, although SEC officials won't discuss
what was said until the commission issues an official order. The
Chicago court order requires the commission to issue its order by
Jan. 18, SEC officials say.

  The key to the SEC's decision is that RMJ's system functions as
a so-called billboard without intermediary market makers who
continuously make a two-sided market, according to Stephen
Lynner, president of RMJ Options Trading Corp., who attended the
commission hearing. Says Lynner: "In the SEC's mind, what most
clearly delineates an exchange in the rules and procedures
imposed by its sponsors is a requirement that a subgroup of
participants in the system make bids and offers on the securities
in the system on a continuous basis. We don't have anything in
our procedures that requires anybody to do that."

  Instead, RMJ's billboard system "displays indications of
interest of the price at which someone wants to buy or sell, but
there is no requirement that anybody put up an offer." Indeed,
many days have gone by, especially since the Chicago court issued
its order last summer, when no participants have put up bids or
offers, Lynner says.

  The RMJ system advertises indications of interest to buy or
sell, but executions are done by telephone. In the RMJ system, a
potential buyer calls an RMJ broker to enter a bid into the
system, which other system participants will see on dumb
terminals. A potential seller calls the broker to indicate his
interest. By phone, the broker confirms the deal with both
parties and consummates the transaction with a keystroke.

                       What's an Exchange?

  During the commission hearing, which lasted over an hour, staff
in the SEC's division of market regulation presented arguments to
the commissioners about what constitutes an exchange, according
to Lynner. He says that among the features the staff said
distinguish RMJ's system from an exchange are the following: the
absence of a physical trading floor; no concept of members who
buy a seat; and the idea that the system's sponsor selects what
securities will be traded.

  But, says Lynner, the staff indicated that even "the presence
of any of those things with a billboard doesn't turn the system
into an exchange." Rather, he says, the SEC staff suggested that
"the expectation of a two-sided market may draw the system into
more of an exchange than a billboard."

  Last summer's Chicago court order created a "dearth of
interest" from the 23 participants in RMJ's market, Lynner says.
Now that the SEC has ruled in RMJ's favor, Lynner expects
transaction volume to pick up shortly. He says the system's
screens are already "filling up with bids and offers," that
spreads are tighter and that in general "people are spending more
time with the system."

KAPITI AND AREGON JOIN FORCES
IN MOVE SEEN AS CONSOLIDATION

  U.K. financial software firms Aregon International Ltd. and
Kapiti Ltd. have merged in what appears to be a shotgun wedding
arranged by venture capital companies Advent Ltd. and Electra
Investment Trust, which have stakes in both companies.

  The combined company will operate under Kapiti's name. Barry
Roberts, Aregon's managing director, becomes executive chairman
of the combined company. Dick Willott remains as Kapiti's
managing director. Sources say Aregon has been up for sale for
some time.

  Kapiti and Aregon have not crossed paths before at client
installations, despite Kapiti's customer list of 500 institutions
worldwide. Previous cooperative ventures thus didn't play a role
in bringing the two parties together.

  Sources at the newly combined company attribute the move to
product synergies. But sources say it's more likely that
investors Advent and Electra saw the merger as a means of
maintaining product lines while reducing costs.

  The move makes sense for Kapiti, which last year launched a
front-office deal-capture module to its Equation back-office
package. Customers balked at the module's primitive functionality
and high price, sources say. Aregon's FIST, a digital feed
handler and development toolkit, and its new TS-STAR decision
support software could enhance Kapiti's credibility in the front
office.

                     Picture of Aregon Gray

  But for Aregon, the picture is different. Aregon has been going
through a bad patch lately, sources say, although the emergence
of TS-STAR has sparked some market interest. Some of the
company's problems are said to spring from its relationship with
DEC.

  Aregon, which has traditionally based its products on the
VAX/VMS platform, has looked to DEC and in particular the
company's DECtrade initiative as a vehicle to carry it into the
market for large trading-room systems.

  DEC, however, recently acquired the PriceWatch package from
Security Pacific Corp.'s Sequor Group subsidiary. Both FIST and
PriceWatch perform a similar function within DECtrade; they both
manage incoming data feeds and deliver real-time market data to
user positions. DEC's purchase of PriceWatch suggests it will be
favored by DEC over FIST. Observers say Aregon regarded its
involvement in DECtrade as "vital" to the company's future.

  Aregon has attempted to widen its possible market through a
marketing agreement with IBM (TST, Feb. 27, 1989). But that
accord has yet to bear fruit.

  The new Kapiti will post 1989 sales of more than 21 million
pounds sterling and pretax profit of 3.5 million pounds sterling.
The company's products will include Aregon's FIST and TS-STAR
packages and Kapiti's Equation. The complementarity of the
products, according to Jeremy Wood, executive director at Aregon,
is "obvious."

  Aregon says the merger gives it access to an international
sales and marketing infrastructure that will improve distribution
channels for its products. Aregon's two offices, in London and
New York, will be merged with those of Kapiti. Kapiti, a supplier
of back-office processing software primarily to foreign branches
of major banks, will gain access to Aregon's client list of more
than 20 trading institutions.

                     It Couldn't Not Happen

  Aregon's products cater to the front-office trading
environment. FIST is a digital feed handler that features an
applications development toolkit. U.S.-based users of the system
include J.P. Morgan & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Bankers Trust
Co. and Citicorp, Wood says. TS-STAR is a recently launched
analytics package that delivers easy-to-digest graphical
representations of financial data relationships (TST, Nov. 6,
1989).

  Kapiti's Equation is a back-office processing system that
covers all functions of a bank's international department or
foreign branch office, including money markets and capital
markets trade processing. According to Peter Nizich, senior vice
president at Kapiti Inc. in New York, Equation "serves as the
mainframe for the branch office." The package runs on an IBM
AS/400 computer with user access via IBM PCs on a local area
network. Users in the U.S. include First Interstate Bank and
National Australia Bank.

  Both Wood and Nizich agree that the merger is almost certain to
result in the development of a front-to-back-office package. "I
couldn't see how it couldn't," says Wood. Nizich is certain an
interface between FIST and Equation is technologically possible
and will be forthcoming.

TGB SEEKS CAPITAL AFTER
ASSETRONICS DEAL COLLAPSES

  The purported acquisition of interdealer bond broker TGB Corp.
by Assetronics is off, according to Henry Wattson, head of TGB.
The deal was to have given Assetronics a 20% interest in the
brokerage innovator. TGB's regulatory capital has dipped below
requisite levels, resulting in a suspension of trading.

  Reported in the trade press as a fait accompli, the acquisition
failed because Assetronics and its founder Jerry Kaplan reneged
on their buyout intentions, according to Wattson. Commenting on
the reasons behind the aborted acquisition, Wattson says
Assetronics' Kaplan "got cold feet."

  A letter of intent had been signed by Assetronics, according to
a source close to the deal, stating that the companies would
effectively combine their resources. The agreement was terminated
when "contingent conditions in the letter were not met", the
source says.

  Founded in 1988, TGB hoped to gain market share by slashing
commissions and using technology to redefine the broker-trader
relationship (TST, July 5, 1988). TGB brokers enter orders into
an automatic order matching system, rather than executing trades
by voice. TGB was partially capitalized by primary dealers and
planned to generate income by selling transaction information.

  Assetronics has no business or holdings except cash, and is
looking for acquisitions and/or mergers, a source says.

  With Wattson's proven track record in interdealer bond
brokerage, TGB was widely regarded as a company to watch.
Although TGB still is planning for the future, it is now mired in
financial troubles. "As of yesterday we were $40,000 under-
capitalized," Wattson said last week. "We ran out of regulatory
capital."

  "What we're trying to do right now is refinance," Wattson says.
"TGB is close to finalizing a deal with another source of
capital....we've got other irons in the fire." Details were not
available. Until it comes up with the requisite funds, TGB is not
permitted to function as an interdealer broker for any securities
transactions.

CBOE-AMEX STUDY REJECTS
PHLX-PSE-NYSE FINDINGS

  A new study on multiple listing of options strongly opposes the
recommendations of an earlier study sponsored by the Pacific,
Philadelphia and New York stock exchanges' task force. The study,
commissioned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the
American Stock Exchange, rejects the earlier study's proposed
Options Market Integration System (OMINTS) (TST, Oct. 23, 1989)
for multiple trading of options.

  The exchanges' lack of cooperation has prompted Richard
Breeden, chairman of the SEC, to force them to the negotiating
table.

  In a letter to exchange officials this week, Breeden has
amended the planned rule change set to take place on Jan. 22
(TST, June 5, 1989). The lottery system for newly-traded issues
will be phased out as planned, but Breeden has decided to extend
the ban on multiple listing of existing issues until the five
exchanges sit down and discuss a plan for linking the exchanges.

  The CBOE-AMEX study says OMINTS, a proposed intermarket order-
routing system similar to the Intermarket Trading System (ITS)
that has linked U.S. stock exchanges since 1978, is redundant,
outdated and would not serve the best interests of investors.

  The CBOE and AMEX are the largest U.S. options exchanges in
terms of trading volume, with 44% and 30% of the market
respectively. Philadelphia has 13%, the Pacific exchange 11% and
the NYSE a 2% share.

                       Staying Competitive

  While Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange defends OMINTS as "a logical first step," the authors of
the CBOE-AMEX study say the system would "lock the market into an
old concept that will significantly impair the ability to develop
new and more advanced solutions later."

  The new study questions the OMINTS feature which allows
specialists to choose between meeting the best inter-exchange bid
or offer, and thereby executing the order, and re-routing a
customer order. The study says this reduces the immediacy of
execution, and that the broker initiating the trade from his
office should decide the final destination of a customer order.

  This, the authors believe, will compel each market maker to
maintain a competitive bid or offer, and thus help to keep the
markets competitive and allow the investor to execute quickly and
cost-effectively. Both studies claim to propose measures that
will prevent market fragmentation -- the task forces's by
implementing an integrated order-routing system and the CBOE-
AMEX's by preserving competition.

  The new study, jointly authored by Yakov Amihud, professor of
finance at New York University's Stern School of Business and
Haim Mendelson, professor of decision sciences and information
systems at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, was
prepared in response to the SEC's white paper calling for
comments on multiple listing of options. The Pacific-
Philadelphia-New York study was executed by Tellefsen Consulting
Group Inc.

                         Looking Forward

  In keeping with the CBOE and AMEX's desire to take a more
forward-looking approach, the professors have released only an
interim study. They will not release their final recommendations
for a market integration system until after multiple trading
commences, allowing the impact of multiple listing to be
assessed.

  In a letter to Chairman Breeden, Nicholas Giordano, president
of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, says the CBOE-AMEX study
offers no "concrete alternatives to or legitimate criticisms of
OMINTS" and therefore the members of the task force are convinced
OMINTS is the best alternative.

  Although the exchanges continue to argue over how to integrate
the options markets, they all consider development of new pricing
systems for their specialists a top priority.

  Options specialists at the AMEX have started using The Options
Pricing System (TOPS), a computerized options pricing model that
updates prices as the underlying stock prices change. TOPS was
jointly developed by the AMEX and David Bruce & Co., a Chicago
financial software developer, and the Securities Industry
Automation Corp.

                        Faster is Better

  Selected CBOE market makers have had an online analytical
system installed. PC Auto Quote uses different pricing models to
quickly calculate option prices (TST, Oct. 23, 1989). The pilot
system uses IBM PS/2 terminals with touch sensitive screens and
has been installed at three booths covering four equity options
series. The exchange's floor procedure committee approved the
installation of the pilot as a test to see if online systems help
to increase order flow.

  The Philadelphia Stock Exchange is also developing an auto-
quote system for options specialists. The auto-quote system has
been in use for a few years on the exchange's currency floor.
Officials say the exchange hopes to have the entire options floor
operational by April. The auto-quote system updates options
prices as the underlying security moves. The exchange is also
using software developed by David Bruce, but because the software
will run on a high-powered workstation, exchange officials claim
Philly market makers can update prices six times faster than
users of Amex's TOPS system.

  The Pacific Stock Exchange will have an auto-quote system tied
to its online Pacific Options Exchange Trading System (POETS) to
allow specialists to quickly update options prices.

  The NYSE is in the process of installing an online automatic
quote system for its specialists. The system will carry quotes
for all issues traded on the NYSE.

Dealing 2000-2 foreign exchange order-matching system, Telerate
Inc. is developing a rival system that will preserve the role of
the broker in the interbank market. Telerate has traditionally
maintained close relationships with brokers, particularly with
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., which provides Telerate with U.S.
government securities prices under an exclusive arrangement.

  The proposed system will display executable, two-way prices
contributed by foreign exchange brokers. Subscribers to
Telerate's Trading Service (TTS) will be able to view and hit
firm broker prices through their TTS slates instead of having to
trade over the telephone. Telerate says it is talking to brokers
about participating in the system but has yet to conclude a firm
agreement.

  The system will use the same worldwide network Telerate built
to support TTS. Telerate says development of the system -- dubbed
the Broker Version -- is 85% completed. The only upgrade required
to access the new system will be installation of a color version
of the monochrome TTS dealer slate. TTS is a conversational
interbank trading service that competes with Reuters' Monitor
Dealing and Dealing 2000 systems.

  Dealing 2000-2, which is slated for rollout before the third
quarter of this year, will make Reuters the sole intermediary for
its own screen-based market. The system is expected to take some
business away from the telephone-based forex broker market.

  Telerate says its Broker Version will retain the existing
broker structure of the over-the-counter foreign exchange market.
In that structure, banks telephone brokers to get two-way prices
on any currency combination. The brokers match sellers and
buyers, taking a cut in the process.

                      Black Boxes Premature

  In more direct competition to Reuters' Dealing 2000-2 is RADAR,
a black-box order-matching system under development by RADAR
Financial L.P., a joint venture comprising MAI PLC, Euro Brokers
Inc. and a number of as yet undisclosed partners (TST, Oct. 23,
1989). But according to Jim Wiseman, chief designer of TTS,
Telerate doesn't believe the foreign exchange market is ready for
an anonymous black-box trading system.

  A TTS user would access the Broker Version by hitting a field
on his slate marked with the letter B. This would change the
format of both the slate and the screen in front of the trader.
The Broker Version slate shows the same function fields along the
lower edge of the slate.

  Above the function fields, the slate is divided horizontally
into two segments. The lower segment contains the bank's own
rates for selected currency pairs. The upper segment shows the
best three broker bid and offer rates for the currency pair the
trader is dealing in. The bids and offers are arranged in a
pyramid formation, with the best bid and offer side by side at
the top-center of the slate.

                          Hit the Field

  To hit a broker at a particular bid or offer, the trader
touches the relevant field on his slate. At this point, the
transaction is immediately executed, with the system
automatically exchanging settlement details between the two
parties. If the trader hit the best bid or offer on the slate,
the previous second-best bid or offer moves to the top of the
pyramid and the new third-best bid or offer joins the pyramid at
the bottom. If the trader hits the second- or third-best bid or
offer, the system automatically hits the best bid or offer at the
same time and calculates the average rate for the transaction.

  At the center of the pyramid is a field that displays details
of the most recent three transactions the trader has completed
that day. Included in the data are the identities of the
counterparties with which the deals were struck. The trader is
able to scroll up and down in this field, giving him access to
transactions made earlier in the day.

  Meanwhile, a fifth quadrant superimposed onto the center of the
trader's screen displays the best three broker bids and offers in
the system, plus the bank's own rates. An incoming call from a
counterparty on the TTS network would automatically take
precedence on the screen over the broker quadrant.

STRATUS TOUTS JAPANESE
DEAL STRUCK LAST SPRING

  Security must be pretty tight in Japan these days, because
Yamaichi Securities has only just allowed Stratus Computer Inc.
to announce a $1.9 million deal the computer manufacturer struck
last spring with Toshiba Engineering Co. Two of the three XA
2000s Yamaichi acquired in the deal have actually been up and
running since last summer.

  A Stratus Computer Inc. press release dated Jan. 2 and sent to
TST offices via Federal Express, fax and ordinary mail boldly
claims: "Stratus wins $1.9 million contract to supply Yamaichi
Securities with online trading system."

  The third Stratus XA 2000, which was also delivered last
summer, will support a trading system to be developed by systems
integrator Toshiba for Yamaichi. Stratus' contract is actually
with the systems integrator, which is developing the futures and
options trading system that will run on Stratus computers at
Yamaichi offices in Japan.

                     Economic with the Facts

  The release also says that "the Stratus-based system...is
already online," distributing "real-time futures and options
prices listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to Sun Workstations" on
Yamaichi's trading floor and at branch offices.

  A long discussion starting on page 2 of the press release
describes in detail what seems to be a ticker plant, not a
trading system. There is no further mention of the futures and
options trading system in development.

  A little investigation helped sort out the situation. Yes,
Stratus assures us, the release does describe a ticker plant that
uses Stratus technology, and that system has been in operation
since the summer. A Stratus XA 2000 model 120 receives the
prices, and a model 110 distributes the data to broker
workstations, Stratus says. Yamaichi wanted a second machine to
perform the ticker plant function usually performed by one
because the firm plans to run other, as yet undisclosed
applications on it, Stratus explains.

  Now that the ticker plant is up and running, a trading system
is being developed, Stratus says. The third Stratus, another
model 120 Yamaichi got in last spring's deal, is being used by
Toshiba Engineering to develop a new application for futures and
options trading, Stratus says.

TECHNOLOGY FORECASTING AND
HUMAN FACTORS AT HP SEMINAR

  Hewlett-Packard's recent seminar on Technological Challenges
Facing the Securities Industry might well have been subtitled
True Confessions of Trading Systems Design. Two speakers, Scott
Abbey, managing director and head of worldwide operations for
Morgan Stanley & Co., and George Kenney, senior vice president of
O'Connor & Associates, offered unusually candid and informative
presentations. The meeting was co-sponsored by Business Week.

  Morgan Stanley does its share of strategic technology
forecasting, striving to identify the shape of trading systems to
come. Before airing his latest prognosis, Abbey turned the clock
back five years to review Morgan Stanley's then-current vision of
trading systems of the future.

                    "What hasn't happened..."

  * The attempt to satisfy all the trader's needs -- market data,
position management, analytics etc. -- with a single device was
"one of the driving forces" of Morgan Stanley's development
effort in the early-to-mid 1980s. But it met with "tremendous
resistance."

  Not only was it difficult to create a single system as good at
multiple applications as separate systems would be, but traders
insisted on being able to see all their data all the time.

  * Morgan Stanley had expected to see a reduction in the average
number of devices per trader. Instead, the "tower of power" at
many traders' desks is actually getting higher.

  * Large screen devices with partitions -- like the IBM 3290
plasma display -- were a hot prospect until Abbey & company found
out that traders didn't like not being able to see over their
terminals.

  * Abbey and his team also looked into windowing systems on
normal-sized displays, but traders were adamant about being able
to see "all the information," so overlapped windows were
discarded.

  * He had expected much of the analytic workload to migrate from
mainframes to workstations. Instead, "a lot of the MIPS on the
desk" are being applied to the user interface.

  Meanwhile, "a tremendous number of Lotus spreadsheets" have
popped up on PCs. But PC power hasn't replaced any mainframes. In
fact, there are even more mainframes, due to increased demand for
local data collection, storage, processing and retrieval.

                     "What Has Happened..."

  * Five years ago, Abbey decided to pay the small incremental
price of making his firm's terminals "graphics-capable." Today, a
lot more graphics are being used at Morgan Stanley -- for
spreads, trends and graphical user interfaces.

  * There's been a significant increase in the use of internal
data. Five or 10 years ago, capital markets traders used external
(market) data almost exclusively. Today, more traders have access
to position data, internal research and customer data.

  * More interactive software is allowing traders greater
flexibility in configuring and passing data among applications.

                           What's Next

  Undaunted by his spotty forecasting track record, Abbey went on
to share his predictions for the next five years.

  * The availability of high resolution intermediate-sized (12"-
15") monitors will result in increased use of windowing
interfaces and mice. The higher resolution and larger size will
satisfy traders' need to see all their data, while the shape of
the monitors won't obstruct vision.

  * Mainframe applications developed for the batch environment
will continue to be grandfathered -- partly because of the
investment in new applications that talk to the old ones, and
partly because of the need to amortize the old applications
themselves. Systems designers, Abbey seems to say, will continue
to be held hostage by financial inertia.

  This prediction may hold more meaning for Morgan Stanley -- as
developers and users of the omnipurpose, mainframe-based Tradepro
trade processing behemoth -- than for other firms.

  * Workstations will be the focal point for integration of data
from heterogeneous in-house mainframes as well as outside data
sources. Morgan Stanley has devoted a lot of resources to develop
connectivity software that will allow workstations to run
applications that crunch data from remote, mainframe databases.

  * Some of the incremental power of new workstations will
support more sophisticated graphical user interfaces. For a 15 or
25 MIP machine, says Abbey, one to three MIPS of window
management is insignificant.

  * A lot of money will be wasted on workstations simply because
they're sexy and the salesman does a good job, and because buyers
look at the one-off cost rather than quantity.

  * Another dumpster load of money will be wasted because people
don't understand how to build distributed systems. "Despite what
anybody says," says Abbey, "I don't believe that that technology
exists and is widely understood."

  Abbey believes it will take a lot of blood, sweat and tears,
thousands of programming hours and "not a lot of profits" to make
a distributed system work. But he believes the investment is
necessary. "There's no way around it; we have to fail and we have
to stand up to our management and say, this is why we have to do
it."

                     The Facts of Half-Life

  Now with O'Connor, George Kenney came from the American Stock
Exchange where he guided the development of a theoretical options
pricing system (TOPS). The system was developed, Kenney says,
because specialists on the floor of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange were consistently out-quoting the AMEX specialists.
Kenney's AMEX experience left him with a healthy respect for the
human and political factors of systems design.

  The first duty of a trading systems designer, according to
Kenney, is to survive long enough to complete a project.
Unfortunately, "the time it takes to implement and design an
architecture greatly exceeds the half-life of MIS directors."

  At the AMEX, Kenney lasted two years. His successor, says
Kenney, must decide whether to complete the project Kenney
started or throw it away or do something that will have his name
on it. Kenney advises systems architects to make a "sober
assessment of the political climate, both yours personally and
that of the firm."

TECHNOLOGY FORCASTING
PART TWO

                     Consider the Lowly User

  But the biggest challenge facing the systems designer, says
Kenney, is making "the impedance match between these great
systems you're spending all this money to design and this poor
user who has to use it."

  Kenney had just come from visiting the New York offices of his
new employer. And while praising O'Connor's "tremendous
technology," he also points out that "a lot of the users really
don't know how to turn the systems on, so 95% of the sparkle that
system can deliver is really lost."

  Systems designers, says Kenney, are the least qualified people
to make the match between systems and users because they think
differently from users. Designers, for example, are comfortable
with "hidden information," while users are not.

  Kenney told of a brief encounter with one AMEX specialist
during tests of an electronic display book. The specialist
remarked, You see this ticket? I can touch it. I can smell it,
and I trust it. And I don't trust this electronic book. You'll
sneak orders into it and I'll never know about them.'

                       Eggheads Under Fire

  Systems designers, according to Kenney, don't like talking to
users. Instead, they like to deal with system specifications.
"They get the specs and then go hide behind them and design their
system and then they sort of throw it over the wall," said
Kenney.

  Talking to users is "very painful" for systems designers,
according to Kenney. "It takes time -- time away from valuable
design." Kenney likens the state of computer systems design to
automotive engineering in the 1940s.

  Apropos of systems design, Kenney acknowledges his intellectual
debt to John D. Gould, a human factors scientist at IBM's
Hawthorne, New York research center. Gould's paper, "How to
Design Usable Systems," will appear as a chapter in the "Handbook
of Human-Computer Interaction" edited by Martin Helander and to
be published by North-Holland Press.

  The Gould paper describes "good computer systems" as "easy to
learn, easy to use, contain[ing] the... functions that allow
people to do the things they want to do, and that are well-
liked." To meet these goals, Gould says designers should learn to
pay more attention to users and the user interface throughout the
design process.

                  How to Design Usable Systems

  Several clever tactics for increasing user orientation -- both
in the conceptual and testing phases -- are advocated by Gould,
including:

  * Begin writing the user manual before any code is written --
in some cases the draft user manual can become the definitive
design document;

  * Define explicit behavioral targets (not MIPS or I/O rates)
for systems performance and test for them. A behavioral goal
might be, after an hour's unsupervised exposure to the system, a
trader must be able to execute 10 trades, accurately enter the
trade data, and check his position, in two minutes';

  * Eliminate intermediaries, such as marketing research people,
between systems designers and users;

  * While observing users, ask them to think aloud about what
they are doing as they are doing it;

  * Schedule design meetings in users' work areas;

  * Observe and videotape users in their work environment --
videotapes "are often much more convincing than charts and oral
reports;

  * Include users on the design team -- participative design
improves the probability of user acceptance;

  * Sketch user scenarios and show them to the design team to
provoke arguments about the user interface;

  * Create mock-ups and simulations -- one group simulated a
"listening typewriter" by having a concealed typist enter what
users said.

                   Living in a "Sea of Change"

  Like Kenney, Gould accuses systems designers of avoiding
contact with users whenever possible. As a result, designers tend
to design systems to satisfy themselves, not users. "Smart
systems designers like to build projects that have high
intellectual content," says Kenney.

  Gould also thinks designers must learn to embrace failure in
order to succeed. Since nobody, no matter how gifted, gets it
right the first time, designers must commit to an iterative
process, says Gould, and be willing to work in the midst of a
"sea of change."

  Of course, an iterative design process is only possible with
the right tools. Gould acknowledges the need for a user interface
management system (UIMS).

  The UIMS, says Gould, "provides for a well defined interface
between that portion of the code that contains the user interface
and that portion of the code that implements the functions of the
user interface." Gould cites "Apollo Computer's ADM" and
"Cosmic's (NASA software) TAE" as examples of commercially
available UIMSs.

                      Off the Drawing Board

  Kenney actually used some of Gould's techniques while
developing AMEX's TOPS. He hired two industrial psychologists who
spent three months gaining the confidence of the specialists and
developing a model of the user interface. He formed a users
committee and developed story boards depicting user scenarios. He
designed a mock-up of a custom keyboard, and prototyped a
simulator for users on a PC.

  "The users were becoming authors; they became invested in the
system," says Kenney. "And user satisfaction is key to the
survivability of the MIS director." Key, but no guarantee.
