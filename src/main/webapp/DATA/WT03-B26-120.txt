<H3>Vulnerability To Future Disturbance </H3>
<HR>

<P>
The vulnerability to future disturbance is determined by dynamic
factors that drive landuse change; principally market demand,
new technologies or climatic shifts.
<P>
Equally important are the constraints to landuse change; such
as the intrinsic and static nature of the landscape itself, the
soils and topography, and the social dynamic of tenure.
<P>
All factors have, are, and will continue to interact, changing
both rapidly and slowly over decades. Only tenure, the critical
social control of landuse, was considered here; and for both the
ILZ and ELZ combined.
<P>
The assessment was focused on tenure vulnerability and was based
on the relative distribution of the area of each landcover type
between the tenure types set out in <A HREF="chap2c.htm#table4">Table 4</A>.
The six tenures listed in this Table offer different levels of
protection against future disturbance ranging from none, with
Freehold, to total protection with Conservation tenure. A numeric
measure was computed as the mean of the sum of the products of
the percentage area in each of the six tenure classes of <A HREF="chap2c.htm#table4">Table 4</A>
and their protection ratings (0-5). Based on this value, a vulnerability
rating and score was arbitrarily but plausibly set as low (* ,
&gt; 50% protected), moderate (** , 25-50% protected), and high
(*** , &lt; 25% protected). <HR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="table15"></A>Table 15</B>: The distribution of relative
area (%) of the six tenure levels for all landcover types within
the ILZ and ELZ. The score was based on the mean sum of the products
of the percentage areas and the tenure protection ratings that
are lowest with tenure type 1 and highest with tenure type 6.
