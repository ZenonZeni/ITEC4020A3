<b>Foreword</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>As this booklet is being prepared in the Fall of 1994, several profound
changes are evolving in federal policy.<p>
<p>
Sustainable development, a concept defined by a United Nations commission in
1986, is becoming an accepted principle among government agencies, as well as a
widely valued strategy for economic development worldwide.<p>
<p>
Renewable energy resources, which experienced a burst of national interest
after the oil shocks of the 1970s, only to be forgotten by most consumers
during the 1980s, are enjoying a comeback. Solar, wind, geothermal and biomass
power all are being appreciated by policy makers again as keys to making
economic development compatible with environmental health.<p>
<p>
National disaster policy is undergoing a revolution. Since the mid-1930s, when
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was told by Congress to tame the nation's
rivers, considerable treasure and know-how were spent building flood control
structures -- dams, levees and the like.<p>
<p>
Now, humbled 60 years later by the Great Flood of 1993 in the Midwest, policy
makers are accepting a new approach:  It's time to make peace with rivers.
The Great Flood appears to be giving birth to a nonstructural era in which the
principal strategy will be not to fight flooding but to avoid it, often by
moving people out of the way.<p>
<p>
These developments are important signs of maturity in federal policy. But as it
turns out, the seeds were planted long ago and far away from Washington, D.C.,
by a village deep in the Mississippi River watershed. Soldiers Grove,
Wisconsin, pioneered the three-cornered strategy of relocation, renewable
energy and sustainable development starting in 1975. Few people paid attention.
After the Great Flood forced other Midwest communities to decide whether and
how to rebuild, however, the story of Soldiers Grove surfaced as a model.<p>
<p>
In 1978, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) played a role in helping Soldiers
Grove study its energy options. Now, at a time when more communities are
thinking about following a similar path to find their futures, we are pleased
to offer this case study of the Soldiers Grove project.<p>

<b>Introduction</b><p>
<p>
Hurricanes, earthquakes and floods of nearly biblical proportions have
devastated regions of our country in recent years, causing great loss of life,
property and livelihood. Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki caused nearly $20 billion
in property damage when they touched down in South Florida and Hawaii,
respectively, in 1992. The Northridge earthquake, which lasted only 30 seconds,
caused an estimated $30 billion in property damage in Southern California in
January 1994. And in what is now commonly referred to as the Great Flood of
1993, communities spread over 10 million acres were inundated by floods that
caused as much as $16 billion in countable damages in the nine Midwestern
states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa,
Wisconsin, Illinois, and Missouri.<p>
<p>
These enormous damage tallies represent hundreds of thousands of disrupted
lives and hundreds of shattered communities. But, just as it is certain that
such disasters will continue to strike, the human response to them is equally
inevitable: People will want to return their lives to normal as soon as
possible, even if that means moving back into the path of danger.<p>
<p>
There is another way. Disaster victims can rebuild their lives better than they
were before, taking advantage of reconstruction to fix a variety of personal
and community problems. Particularly after major disasters, reconstruction is
an opportunity for individuals to replace aging, damaged buildings with new
structures, built with the latest techniques and equipment to lower heating and
cooling costs. Reconstruction can restore local tax base and boost the local
economy with new jobs. Businesses can re-size or even change their character to
better meet the community's needs. Local wells and emergency services can
be rebuilt outside the reach of floodwaters. Aging infrastructure can be
restored. And, perhaps most importantly, communities in areas of predictable
disasters can take advantage of reconstruction to reduce or even eliminate the
danger of further damages, removing that dark shadow from their futures.<p>
<p>
In the aftermath of the Great Flood of 1993, a movement has begun toward
"sustainable redevelopment"-- the practice of recovering from
disasters in ways that improve the quality of people's lives, the
durability of their communities, and the prospects of their children. As this
book was being written in the Spring of 1994, at least three Midwestern
communities were actively employing sustainable redevelopment principles in
their recovery from flooding the year before. A White House Task Force was
calling for profound reforms in the nation's disaster recovery policies,
including the use of sustainable redevelopment practices as communities
rebuild. "Relocations, in particular, offer a unique opportunity to start
from scratch in planning and constructing to assure that sustainable
development becomes an integral part of the entire community," the Task
Force says.<p>
<p>
"Each community would choose the characteristics it wished to sustain,
such as an agricultural base, the historic or rural nature of the town,
affordable housing, energy and/or water efficiency, diversity of species or
natural resources," the Task Force recommended. "Com-munities would
incorporate these into planning and construction. Individuals also would use
energy-efficient technologies to conserve limited natural resources with
resultant cost savings. As part of response and recovery, a team of federal
experts would work through state agencies to provide communities and
individuals technical assistance and information on the use of more innovative
technologies."<p>
<p>
Nearly 20 years before the Great Flood of 1993, one small river town pioneered
the path of sustainable redevelopment. In 1975, the flood-prone village of
Soldiers Grove, Wisconsin, was offered a levee by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. It chose instead to leave the flood plain and rebuild on higher
ground. In the process, it identified and attempted to solve a wide variety of
community problems, and it made dramatic use of energy efficiency measures and
solar heating in its new business district, becoming America's first "solar
village."<p>
This booklet recounts the story of Soldiers Grove, in hopes that the lessons it
learned can be beneficial to other communities that are now exploring or fully
embarked upon the path of sustainable redevelopment. <p>
<p>

<p>
<b>Chapter One:  Why Sustainability?</b><p>
<p>
What is sustainable development? <p>
<p>
The most commonly accepted definition was written by the United Nations
Commission on Environment and Development. Sustainable development, it said,
"meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their needs." Another definition calls sustainable
development "the practice of living off the Earth's interest, not its
principle."<p>
<p>
For the purposes of this book, we'll talk about sustainable
"redevelopment" -- in other words, how sustainable development
can be applied in communities that are rebuilding after disasters. And
we'll give "sustainable" a very practical definition, relating
to the very practical problems a community faces in the aftermath of natural
disaster. Sustainable redevelopment...<p>
<p>
<b>Reduces or eliminates a community's conflict with its environment.</b>
The most evident conflict in disaster-prone communities, of course, is the
potential loss of lives and property due to natural events like flooding,
hurricanes or earthquakes. In a number of cases, particularly in defined
disaster zones like flood plains, communities can remove themselves from
danger, not by trying to control natural events (a strategy that the Great
Flood proved can be very risky) but by getting out of harm's way. By
restoring a community's physical security and its prospects for a future,
relocation is an important sustainable redevelopment strategy. <p>
<p>
Most communities suffer from many other forms of environmental conflict, too.
Industrial pollution, the handling of solid wastes, air quality problems
stemming from transportation, the lack of adequate sewage treatment -- all
are potential areas of reducing the conflict between people and environment.
Why bother? Because in the long term, a strong economy and a livable community
cannot be sustained without a healthy environment. The goal of sustainable
redevelopment is to find ways that people will prosper, while nature prospers,
too.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Improves the quality of life for the community's residents.</b> Are the
residents of your community's disaster-prone areas living in substandard
housing? Are residential and commercial buildings below health and safety
codes, so damaged that it's prohibitively expensive to fix them? Is your
town lacking certain important businesses -- a clothing store, for example,
or a pharmacy -- encouraging people to shop elsewhere? Are there safety
problems in the community's traffic patterns, health problems in the well
or infrastructure? A community can't be sustained if its residents are not
happy with it. A significant post-disaster redevelopment project can be
designed to become a "multi-purpose recovery"-- a project that
solves a variety of problems.<p>
<p>
<b>Improves the prospects of the community's future generations.</b>
Disaster victims rebuilding their community are, in effect, the founding
fathers and mothers of a new town. Every new home, new business, new village
hall, church or school, must be built not just to return life to normal today,
but to serve the community for a century to come. For their work and their
community to be sustainable, today's disaster victims must rebuild for
their children and grandchildren as well as for themselves. Among other things,
that means using tomorrow's technologies, not yesterday's. Good
technology -- in buildings, waste systems, transportation patterns and
community design -- can make a world of difference. Today's most
energy-efficient homes are heated and cooled with one-third to one-tenth the
energy of a typical home.<p>
<p>
<b>Strengthens the community's economy.</b> Eliminating the prospect of
disasters and replacing old structures with new ones can help improve the local
economy. But communities can redevelop with methods that bolster the economy in
many other ways as well. In many communities, for example, a significant part
of local income leaks away as consumers pay their energy bills. Many local
dollars spent on gasoline, heating oil and other petroleum products end up
overseas. A community-wide effort to reduce energy costs can plug that leak,
keeping dollars at home where they can purchase other goods and services,
strengthening the local economy. <p>
<p>
<p>
How much money are we talking about? One study sponsored by the State of
Nebraska indicates that 80 cents of every dollar spent on energy bills leaves
the typical local economy without generating any other economic activity. Every
dollar spent on energy efficiency rather than fossil fuels, however, stimulates
84 cents worth of additional local economic activity. <p>
<p>
Another economy-booster: Local businesses involved in relocation can become
stronger by improving their locations to become more visible to shoppers, or to
become closer to needed transportation facilities. They can resize or change
the nature of their businesses, becoming better able to meet the needs of local
consumers.<p>
<p>
<b>Shifts the community's resource consumption to renewable rather than
finite resources.</b> A community whose economy depends on finite resources
-- petroleum again is a prime example -- builds its future on a
foundation of sand. In the long term, as they are depleted, finite resources
become more expensive, their supplies become less dependable and their
extraction often becomes more environmentally costly. Renewable resources
-- like solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy and agricultural crops
specifically grown for energy production -- will remain plentiful. A
community rebuilding for the next century can build upon a foundation of
resource abundance, rather than resource scarcity.<p>
<p>
According to a 1993 report published by the Energy Information Administration,
renewable resources could provide 93 percent of the nation's energy
supply, if they were fully utilized. Today, however, they provide only a
fraction of the nation's power. Many renewable resources are now
dependable, affordable and clean sources of power. In regions with sufficient
wind, wind power can produce electricity at 7 cents a kilowatt hour, comparable
to the electricity most consumers buy from their utilities and down from 25
cents in 1980. Well-designed passive solar buildings are perfectly
economical.<p>
<p>
<b>Common Misconceptions</b><p>
<p>
Misconceptions continue to surround sustainable development, blocking the way
to more widespread adoption of the technologies involved. Below are a few
common myths, along with explanations of why they are unfounded. <p>
<p>
<i>Sustainability is a utopian concept for the future and not practical in the
present.</i><p>
<p>
Throughout history, communities have been developed near available natural
resources, and a region's architecture was a direct response to the local
climate. Towns and villages were laid out to allow pedestrian access to the
centers of cultural and economic activity. This center may have focused on a
seaport, a river confluence, a crossroads, a church, a sawmill, a factory, or
another facility of significance that caused the settlement to exist. The mixed
variety of shops, markets, apartments and houses that congregated around the
community's center grew out of the necessity for people to walk to where
they worked, shopped, played and governed themselves. Food, energy resources,
building materials and other supplies were locally derived and processed at
many decentralized locations and were continually recycled back into the
community and its adjacent environment.<p>
<p>
Until the late 18th century, humankind relied solely on renewable sources to
meet energy needs. However, as society became more industrialized and
experienced rapid growth, renewables were displaced by "modern,"
nonrenewable energy sources. The proliferation of automobile mobility fed the
increasing consumption of fossil fuels and led to the decentralization of
communities. As cars became more common, it was no longer necessary to maintain
a close-knit community center.<p>
Rather than being a utopian concept for the future, sustainability actually
hearkens back to the past. It does not signal a return to the "horse and
buggy" days, however. Sustainable communities of the 21st century will be
very comfortable places to live, mixing the best of modern technology with the
practical, centralized community focus of the past.  <p>
<p>
<p>
In addition to Soldiers Grove, several other emerging communities exemplify
this trend toward sustainable development. In Michigan, the small villages on
Beaver Island practice economic development through energy self-reliance,
harvesting dead trees for fuel and using solar and wind energy systems.
Residents of Beaver Island have looked at wildlife and wetlands preservation as
contributors to economic development and have recognized that a healthy natural
environment surrounds them with values not readily measured in dollars and
cents.<p>
<p>
Starting from scratch, a new community is being developed at Ithaca, New York,
called EcoVillage. Offering a new and creative approach to building design and
use of space, Ecovillage includes preservation of 80 percent of the land for
natural wildlife and vegetation areas, permaculture and organic food
production, and recreation. The remaining land harbors high-density,
energy-efficient housing, with neighborhoods of homes grouped around a center
of community buildings that provide most basic necessities within walking
distance. EcoVillage at Ithaca is emerging as a model of how an ecological and
socially sustainable community can function, evoking the interest of
architects, landscape developers, design engineers, horticulturalists and
others who see in this project the principles needed to guide future
development.<p>
<p>
<i>Sustainability costs too much.</i><p>
<p>
Actually, sustainable development often costs less than conventional
development, particularly when long-term costs are counted. A enlightening
example is illustrated by reviewing current suburban development, which is
centered around the automobile, which depends on oil, which costs money. Recent
figures place the real cost of owning and driving a car in urban and suburban
America at an average of $500 per month, per person, per car. This figure takes
into account only the measurable dollar costs attributable to purchase price,
insurance, fuel and maintenance, and the associated fuel and infrastructure
taxes. It does not take into account the costs of increased health care due to
air pollution; the costs of traffic accidents; the social and economic
displacement resulting from construction of new highways; the costs of shipping
petroleum from foreign locations; the costs of military protection of the
shipping routes, and the costs of environmental damage caused by extracting and
transporting the fuel.<p>
<p>
Present-day society assumes that the movement of goods and services over
ever-increasing distances is a necessary part of development. Yet, to
sustainable community advocates, excess transportation is an expensive sign of
system failure. Sustainable communities are likely to provide cleaner renewable
fuels, more efficient transportation systems and pedestrian access to many
necessities, thereby decreasing the cost of oil dependence and increasing local
disposable income.<p>
<p>
<i>If sustainable development were a viable option, the market would have
created a demand for it by now.</i><p>
<p>
Sustainability does not represent a service or a commodity. Kentucky author and
poet, Wendell Berry, commenting on American economic culture, writes:
"Anything that cannot be weighed, measured or counted does not
exist." As proposed by Adam Smith over 200 years ago, free market
economics has been largely successful due to this quantifying nature of
humanity. What has occurred in recent decades, however, is a growing failure of
capitalism to assign proper value to many of life's most precious
commodities. What cannot be readily weighed, measured or counted is the quality
of human experience or the value of natural systems. In a market economy,
wetlands and agricultural fields have a low monetary value, relative to real
estate development potential, but their value to human health and
sustainability may be far greater than any development would be. <p>
<p>
Society has begun the difficult task of assigning monetary values to these
"priceless" commodities. For example, many electric utilities are now
required to factor the costs of "externali-ties" such as pollution
and habitat displacement into their resource plans. This trend will expand and
continue until the price of resources reflects much more of their true cost and
value. Then sustainable development will very often emerge as the most
economical option.   <p>
<p>
With today's imperfect yardsticks, it's often difficult to weigh the
real costs and benefits of sustainable options. The key is to make all
advantages and disadvantages of each option known to the community, including
consequences that carry environmental, social or aesthetic -- rather than
economic -- price- tags. To quote Tom Hirsch, Soldiers Grove's
relocation coordinator from May 1975 to August 1982, "It is a hard path,
but it's doable, and Soldiers Grove proved that it's doable. The
benefits did outweigh the costs, and the issues important at the time --
energy management, job creation, community cohesion -- are every bit as
important 20 years later."<p>
 <p>
<i>Our town can't get itself organized enough to do sustainable
redevelopment.</i><p>
<p>
Any community whose people have enough spirit to help each other build levees
out of sandbags can pull together to build a new future. They need the will to
make their town survive; the leadership to keep them working together; and a
clear understanding of why all the work is worth the trouble.<p>
<p>
The community spirit that disasters often spawn -- bringing out the best in
people and prompting them to work in unison for the benefit of all -- can
gather steam and propel the community on into the sustainable development mode.
People can work together to preserve and remember the best of what they're
leaving behind, while looking forward to the creation of something much better.
Disasters often leave their victims with the depressing realization that they
cannot control their own fate. Sustainable redevelopment allows people to begin
taking control of their futures again.<p>
<p>
<i>There are no models we can follow.</i><p>
<p>

how Soldiers Grove proceeded, and then write your own chapter in the history of
America's turn toward sustainable redevelopment. <p>

<b>Chapter Two:  Soliders Grove</b><p>
<p>
When the waters of the Great Flood of 1993 finally receded, some Midwestern
communities were convinced that it wasn't smart to move back into the
flood plain. They searched for a different model. Some heard about Soldiers
Grove, a village in the upper portion of the Mississippi River watershed that
decided to move from harm's way nearly 20 years ago.<p>
<p>
Soldiers Grove was a typical Midwestern village incorporated in 1888 on the
banks of the Kickapoo River in southwest Wisconsin. As the lumber industry,
then farming and urbanization, began stripping vegetation from the river's
watershed, the Kickapoo began to flood. The river hit Soldiers Grove with its
first major flood in 1907. It dumped record amounts of water into the community
again in 1912, 1917, and 1935. The 1935 flood finally made it clear to the
villagers that flooding was a serious and permanent problem. In 1937, Soldiers
Grove joined other Kickapoo communities in petitioning Congress for a flood
control project.<p>
<p>
It was not until 1962 that Congress approved a flood control plan for the
Kickapoo River Valley -- a dam and recreational lake near the top of the
river, and a supplemental levee at Soldiers Grove, all to be built by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers. Construction of the dam and design work on the levee
began in the late 1960s.<p>
<p>
In the three decades that Soldiers Grove waited for dam construction to begin,
the Kickapoo delivered four more floods, including a disastrous record
inundation in 1951 which severely damaged downtown buildings and speeded the
community's economic decline.<p>
<p>
In 1974, the State of Wisconsin required Soldiers Grove to pass a floodplain
zoning ordinance, a law that villagers felt would do more damage to property
than the river itself. The law prohibited any new construction in the business
district and placed strict limits on maintenance or repairs to existing
buildings. The ordinance was a severe blow to the economic heart of the
community.<p>
<p>
The Corps of Engineers presented its final plan for a levee in early 1975. The
villagers had hoped that the levee would solve both the flooding problem and
the need to comply with floodplain zoning. But when the Engineers unveiled the
details of the proposed levee, their message was depressing. The levee would
cost some $3.5 million, yet would protect about $1 million worth of property.
Each year for the next 100 years, the village would have to raise funds equal
to twice its 1975 property tax levy to pay for maintenance of the flood control
structure. And the dike would do little to solve many of the village's
problems -- the outmigration of young people to urban areas, the severe
blight in the downtown, the feeling that Soldiers Grove was slowly dying.<p>
<p>
Their backs against the wall, community leaders came up with a radical
proposal, believing it was the only way to save the village. They suggested
that the federal government spend the same $3.5 million to help the community
evacuate its floodplain and rebuild the business district on higher ground.
Federal assistance would amount to 60 percent of the project's total cost,
with state, local and private investments making up the balance.<p>
<p>
With a small planning grant, Soldiers Grove hired a team of University of
Wisconsin specialists headed by landscape architecture Prof. Phil Lewis to
study the feasibility of relocation. The team concluded that relocation made
good sense.<p>
<p>
In 1977, the village invested its own funds to purchase a site for the new
downtown and begin the extension of utility services. However, federal agencies
were slow to support relocation. For three years -- from the time the idea
was first proposed in early 1975 to 1978 -- the village's appeals for
assistance were denied.<p>
<p>
Then in July 1978, the Kickapoo hit the village again, with the largest flood
in its history. The flood inflicted a half-million dollars in damages,
completely destroying several buildings, including the community's
relatively new concrete block bank. While no one would have wished for such a
flood, it accomplished what community leaders had not been able to: It
galvanized opinion inside and outside the village that Kickapoo River flooding
was inevitable and that relocation must proceed at once. With the help of
then-U.S. Senators William Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson, the flood jarred loose
the support of federal agencies. The Secretary of the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development granted the village $900,000 in the fall of 1978
so that relocation could begin.<p>
<p>
<b>Multipurpose Recovery</b> <p>
<p>
In planning the relocation project, the villagers took the opportunity to
address a number of development goals, reaching beyond their initial objective
of moving the town off the floodplain. Though flooding was the village's
most visible problem, it was not the only one. The nationwide drain of money
and people from rural to urban areas was another hard reality. Soldiers
Grove's population had peaked in 1940 at 778, and since then, both the
population and the economy had been on the decline. Also, in the 1950s, U.S.
Highway 61 had been moved to bypass the Soldiers Grove business district. The
highway, which used to coincide with Main Street, bringing traffic into the
heart of the community, was relocated a half-mile to the east. Downtown
business had not been the same since.<p>
<p>
By 1975, these factors had helped create a local economy in which 36 percent of
the village's families earned less than $3,000 a year. Soldiers Grove had
become a community largely of elderly and low-income people.  <p>
<p>
<p>
The relocation, started in 1979 and completed in 1983, proved to be just what
Soldiers Grove needed -- a community heart transplant. Besides eliminating
flooding, the multipurpose recovery process achieved additional key benefits.
The downtown was moved back to U.S. Highway 61, bringing new economic life into
the community. The old floodplain was developed into a municipal park, complete
with tennis courts, picnic areas, and a number of other recreational
features.<p>
<p>
For years, Soldiers Grove's municipal well had been located in the
floodplain, near the business district. Even minor inundations contaminated the
community water supply. So, the village decided to add a second well and a
larger storage reservoir outside the floodplain in the new downtown.<p>
<p>
The extension of sewer and water services to the relocation site opened up new
development area along its route. It also provided an opportunity for the
village to fix a long-standing problem -- discoloration and odor in the
water in one nearby neighborhood, caused by aging pipes.<p>
<p>
Soldiers Grove's fire and rescue station was located in the floodplain. So
in the move, the community relocated the fire station to a site where emergency
vehicles would not be disabled or cut off during floods.   <p>
	<p>
<b>Nation's First "Solar Village"</b><p>
<p>
Of all the relocation decisions made by Soldiers Grove, one was particularly
dramatic. That was the decision to make all the new town center buildings
energy-efficient and solar-heated. The new Soldiers Grove would be the first
business district of its kind in the nation.<p>
<p>
As with many other aspects of the project, the inspiration grew from a problem.
Energy bills had been a major and increasing cost for many of the Main Street
business owners. Their structures were not only badly deteriorated by flooding,
but old and poorly insulated. They were costly to heat and cool, especially
with fuel oil, the most expensive of fossil fuels at the time.<p>
<p>
Early in the planning stages of relocation, it occurred to some villagers that
construction of a new business district opened the opportunity for Soldiers
Grove to build efficient structures and to promote the use of renewable,
alternative fuels. Thus, the project could have even more local benefits, plus
further value as a national demonstration. Conservation and renewable energy
systems held the promise of increasing local self-reliance while insulating the
community from oil and gas shortages of the future; reducing air pollution in a
valley whose terrain often causes air inversions; and -- most attractively
-- substantially lowering energy bills for businesses. The lower energy
costs would provide a form of  "new income" for business owners.<p>
<p>
To capture these benefits, Soldiers Grove passed energy performance standards
for its new buildings twice as stringent as those required by state law at the
time; approved a community-wide "solar access" law that prohibited
any building from blocking another building's sunlight; passed a law
requiring that all new commercial buildings receive at least half their heating
energy from the sun (the first such ordinance in the nation); conducted a
careful analysis of the relocation site to determine its wind and sunfall
patterns throughout the year; helped businesses position their buildings to
make maximum use of summer breezes and solar heating, while using earth berming
and careful landscaping to block the buildings from winter winds; and conducted
an evaluation of possible building materials to find those that were most
economical, including costs to the environment. In the process, the village
pioneered a new approach to disaster recovery.<p>
<p>
"Soldiers Grove had no road map to follow," said Tom Hirsch, who
served as the community's relocation coordinator from May 1975 to August
1982. "We forged new territory, but now the strategy is there to be taken
up by other communities." <p>

<b>Chapter Three:  How to Begin Planning</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Of all the various components making up Soldiers Grove's pioneering
relocation project, one will be particularly valuable to today's
disaster-affected communities: the <b>process</b> the community followed to
make its new downtown a reality. Today's communities will fashion their
own unique versions of sustainable development, but at least they don't
have to reinvent the wheel when it comes to deciding how to go about
researching their options and carrying out their plans.<p>
<p>
Through the painstaking, often intimidating, process of trial and error,
Soldiers Grove discovered four main components in the early stages of planning
an innovative relocation project: focusing responsibility, doing adequate
homework, locating sources of technical help, and assuring strong citizen
involvement from the beginning. The first three are explained in this chapter;
the fourth -- citizen involvement -- deserves a chapter of its own and
is covered in <a href="RFTF2.html#ref5">Chapter Four</a>.<p>
<p>
<b>Focusing Responsibility</b><p>
<p>
In planning the relocation project and its solar component, Soldiers Grove
found it was necessary to assign one individual responsibility for
coordination. The clear identification of a single individual allowed citizens
within the village and agencies from outside to know exactly where to go with
concerns, questions or ideas. A great many headaches and a great deal of
potential confusion were avoided by appointing and publicizing the role of a
central coordinator.<p>
<p>
In larger communities, the sustainable redevelopment coordinator might be a
member of an existing planning commission or community development office. In
Soldiers Grove, it was necessary to create a new full-time position since the
community at first had only a minimum governmental structure (a village clerk
and a Board) and no existing employees qualified to carry out reasonably
sophisticated planning functions. Using a small federal grant, the village
hired a local architect, Thomas Hirsch, to serve as relocation coordinator.
Later, when the move was about to begin and the complexities of the project
grew, Hirsch was made part of a formal Community Development Office (CDO). And
during the planning process, the Village Board created various citizen
committees to provide guidance and information to Hirsch and the CDO. <p>
<p>
Yet throughout the process, Hirsch was clearly identified as the primary
contact person and the coordinator of the revitalization effort. That
designation was particularly useful to government officials and private firms
which became involved in the project. Government officials analyzing the
success of the project cited the appointment of a competent central coordinator
as a key factor.<p>
<p>
Soldiers Grove found that an accessible central coordinator given sufficient
time and resources to perform the job served as a kind of human glue which held
the project together and helped it proceed as smoothly as possible.<p>
<p>
<b>Doing Homework</b><p>
<p>
The second component of the initial planning process -- homework -- was
also critically important. Before investing significant time and money in a
solar project, the village assessed three factors: local energy resources,
solar potentials and local barriers to solar and other forms of renewable
energy. These were not sophisticated assessments. Rather, they involved simple
data-gathering which was useful immediately in guiding the project.<p>
<p>
Soldiers Grove found it was important to do the homework itself rather than
hiring it out. The assessments were educational, an exercise in introspection
about the community's energy profile. That education allowed villagers to
deal more knowledgeably with outside firms and funding sources, when it became
necessary to use them. It also allowed the project coordinator to exercise
quality control over outside firms contracted later to conduct more
sophisticated feasibility studies. Consulting firms often are tempted to cut
costs by using standard information about such things as sunfall, wind speeds
and the availability of renewable fuels, collecting data from state and
national reports. They are reluctant to spend time gathering local information.
Having done his data-gathering, the coordinator could make sure consultants
were basing their studies on realistic information.<p>
<p>
Based on its experience, the village recommends that communities carefully
inventory their sustainable development needs and resources. A "Quality of
Life" inventory, for example, determines from residents what features they
most want to retain from their old community as it is redeveloped and what new
features -- social, recreational, cultural -- they most want to
acquire. An "Economic Development" inventory might poll local
consumers on what new commercial services they want to see in a reconstructed
community. It might also poll local business owners to find out what they need
to improve their health.<p>
<p>
To provide a more detailed example of how a community can do its homework, the
rest of this chapter tells how Soldiers Grove assessed its energy needs and
eventually decided upon creating a solar village. The community's
innovative decision grew from careful information gathering about 1) its old
energy consumption patterns, 2) its potentials for using sustainable energy, 3)
the energy characteristics of available redevelopment sites, 4) barriers that
would influence the village's energy decisions, and 5) programs that could
help it carry out its decisions.<p>
<p>
<i>Assessing Energy Consumption</i><p>
<p>
An inventory of local energy consumption should include all the conventional
fuels -- oil, natural gas, LP gas, coal and electricity -- used by the
community before it was disrupted by a natural disaster.  Communities should
strive to gather specific information on fuel costs, availability, and
consumption. Local utilities are the likely source for such information.<p>
<p>
This detailed look at conventional energy use can help communities determine
how much money has been leaving their local economies to pay for energy. In
many cases, the grand total will provide a strong incentive for redeveloping
communities to reduce energy costs and explore local sustainable options. <p>
<p>
<i>Assessing Sustainable Energy Potentials</i><p>
<p>
An inventory of local sustainable energy potentials should also focus on
availability and cost. Among the alternatives which might be assessed are
solar, wind, hydroelectric, wood, burnable wastes and sources of alcohol or
biogas -- whey, septic sludge, animal wastes and other byproducts of
agricultural, municipal or industrial operations. An important additional
source of heating energy may be waste heat from electrical generating plants or
factories, heat that can be transferred to neighboring buildings in an
arrangement commonly called "district heating." <p>
<p>
The purpose of such an inventory is fact-finding and direction-setting. It is
not meant to be a feasibility study -- a very sophisticated process which
ought to be performed later by qualified professionals. Rather, this first
assessment is meant to help determine the community's obvious resources
and the questions which need answering by technicians. The data will also help
the community prepare convincing applications for assistance in funding more
detailed feasibility studies.<p>
<p>
For help with this initial inventory, communities can turn to their state
energy offices, local utilities, nearby universities, or the U.S. Department of
Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory which is listed in this
publication's resource section. These contacts may be able to supply data
on a specific locale's wind, sun, or biomass resources.<p>
The community should also inventory potential sources of financial help for
carrying out its energy choices. Information about federal energy programs is
available from the U.S. Department of Energy; state program information can be
obtained from state energy offices, and local utilities can provide details on
their programs. Many utilities now offer financial incentives for consumers to
use energy efficiency and renewable energy systems.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Assessing Available Sites</i><p>
<p>
If the community is relocating, it should assess how available development
sites will affect its energy options. For example, do nearby trees block the
wind? Do existing buildings or natural terrain features cast large shadows on
the site?  These site characteristics will affect the community's energy
choices -- or conversely, the community's energy preferences may
affect which site it chooses.<p>
<p>
For the purposes of this initial assessment, solar potentials, for example, can
be judged by simple observation. The optimal time for making such observations
is December 21, the day at which the sun is lowest in the sky and the shadows
will be greatest. Portions of the site which do not receive direct sunlight
between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. throughout the winter generally are not suitable for
direct use of the sun for heating. And, unless the community has a solar access
law prohibiting one property owner from blocking sunlight for another, future
developments could be a factor.<p>
<p>
<i>Assessing Barriers</i><p>
<p>
Barriers to alternative energy sources such as solar or wind take several
forms. Some, like buildings and trees, are physical. Some are attitudinal.
Others are legal or institutional. A good assessment of energy potentials must
take all into account.<p>
<p>
A growing number of states and federal agencies are attempting to remove
barriers to alternative energy sources from building codes, design standards
and other laws and regulations. Still, such barriers exist. Most of our present
taxing policies, building codes and standards have been designed in the era of
cheap fossil fuels, and not with alternatives in mind.<p>
<p>
It is impossible to identify all barriers early in the planning phase of a
redevelopment project. Inevitably, some obstacles will appear as the project
progresses. If your community is among the first in your state to attempt
large-scale development involving innovative sustainable technologies, you will
be forced to deal with unanticipated barriers, helping remove them for
communities which follow. <p>
<p>
For example, Soldiers Grove decided to create "passive solar attics"
in many of its buildings -- superinsulating the attic spaces and allowing
sunlight to enter through fiberglass roofing panels. One state code classified
the solar attics as heating ducts and prohibited any combustible materials
inside them, including the buildings' wooden roof joists. The village
reached accommodation with state officials by lining the attics with sheet
rock.<p>
<p>
It is important to avoid as many unpleasant surprises as possible by assessing
barriers in the planning phase. Attitudinal barriers can be assessed by
surveying opinions within the community. Are the people most directly affected
by the development project willing to consider solar or other alternative
sources of energy? If not, why not? Do they have questions they want answered
first? What are they? Such surveys can be taken formally or informally,
depending on the size of the group involved and the traditional patterns of
planning and communication within the community. (Soldiers Grove's
procedures for surveying attitudes are covered in the next chapter.)<p>
<p>
Assessing legal barriers is somewhat more tricky. Are there community
ordinances or codes which obviously will stand in the way of solar development?
A common difficulty is the lack of solar access legislation at the local level,
an ordinance which guarantees that once a building owner invests in solar,
sunlight will not be blocked in the future by other development. Is there an
easy way to assure solar access at the new development site?<p>
<p>
Taxing policies also can present barriers. If building owners install solar
systems, will the systems cause a significant increase in property tax
assessments on those properties? If they do, part of the savings the owner will
realize on fuel bills to help pay for the system will be negated by taxes, and
solar will be made, from a purely economic standpoint, less desirable.<p>
<p>
Another barrier may be how much a community will have to rely on government
support in carrying out its project. Oftentimes, the more a community has to
rely on state and federal government support, the more difficult a project
becomes. Funding uncertainties, delays, paperwork and compliance with
complicated restrictions are often included with government grants and loans. A
community may want to consider designing a project which minimizes the need for
outside financial assistance and maximizes self-reliance.<p>
<p>
<b>Finding Technical Help</b><p>
<p>
When the time comes to bring in outside help -- whether a government
agency, an engineering firm or an architectural firm -- the community will
find that such consultants often are not objective. They will tend to favor
those technologies with which they are most familiar. A preliminary assessment
of energy resources -- both conventional and nonconventional -- will
allow a community to seek help from programs and firms able and willing to
assist in application of the energy technologies which seem to have greatest
potential.<p>
<p>
Often, preliminary assistance can be obtained at little or no cost and used
simply to confirm or amend the community's own hunches about its energy
potentials. Short of actual design work or detailed feasibility studies,
preliminary technical assistance is used again to set direction, provide data
for future funding applications and continue realistic appraisals of energy
options before major investments of time and money are made.<p>
<p>
Among the possible sources of preliminary guidance are government agencies,
universities and private firms. Government agencies and universities can
sometimes fit a study into existing programs at little or no cost to the
municipality. University programs can sometimes make such a study a class
project, providing free student labor in exchange for the educational
experience.<p>
<p>
Some private firms, hoping that they will win more substantial contracts later,
will offer relatively low-cost preliminary technical assistance to a community
or a developer. Again, it would be wise to solicit those firms with established
expertise in the energy options which the local assessment indicated are most
likely to be practical.<p>
<p>
But there are pitfalls. You get only what you pay for. Low-cost or no-cost
studies are generally cursory. They should not be taken as gospel. A good
preliminary feasibility study is often more expensive and time-consuming than a
final study, since it must sort through a universe of options. While Soldiers
Grove's experience with government and university-sponsored studies was
very good, such studies can take a long time and produce little.<p>
<p>
Taken for what they are, these sources of technical help can be beneficial. But
they do not replace the detailed feasibility and design work which can make the
difference between success and failure of a particular energy application.<p>
<p>
<b>Soldiers Grove Experience</b><p>
<p>
Soldiers Grove applied each of these steps as it moved toward development of
the solar downtown.<p>
<p>
Following the July 1978 flood when initial funding for floodplain relocation
was obtained, the Community Development Office (CDO) conducted a detailed
inventory of energy resources within the community. The village found small
supplies of whey from local cheese factories, septic sludge from the municipal
waste treatment plant, some burnable solid wastes and useable agricultural
wastes from township dumps and farms surrounding the community, and some
potential for low-head hydroelectric generation on the Kickapoo River. But none
of these indigenous resources seemed to meet the village's needs: a  low-
cost source of heating energy in sufficient supply to justify the capital
expenditures involved in its conversion and use, and immediately available to
the buildings about to be constructed.<p>
<p>
The CDO collected the best available wind data from airports in the region, and
data on the percentage of sunlit days from nearby weather stations. It also
located an inventory of wood wastes in the Kickapoo River Valley, done by a
nearby city which at one time had considered using the wastes to help generate
electricity. The inventory indicated that within a 30-mile radius of Soldiers
Grove, lumber mills were producing 3,000 tons per month of sawdust, wood chips
and scrap bark. Phone<p>
calls to the lumber mills confirmed that the wastes were available and could be
purchased at low cost -- less than $10 per ton delivered. Most mills had no
other market for the wastes, and were simply letting them rot on the ground.<p>
<p>
The CDO observed that most space heating in the old downtown was done by oil
furnaces. No natural gas was used in the community, and only a few businesses
made use of LP gas. As the 1978-79 heating season began, No. 2 fuel oil cost
50.5 cents per gallon and electricity just over 4 cents per kilowatt-hour.<p>
<p>
Soldiers Grove had already selected the site for its new downtown, a farm field
about a half-mile from the old downtown, still within municipal borders.
Purchased by the Village Board in 1977 <p>
when it came up for sale, the site was favored by business owners because it
was adjacent to U.S. Highway 61, a main thoroughfare that promised to boost
trade.<p>
<p>
Another farm field on the opposite end of the village had been available for
development, and that site offered unrestricted access to sunlight. But the
Highway 61 location had an historic and emotional appeal for the business
owners. The highway had been Main Street for Soldiers Grove un-til the
mid-1950s, when it was relocated to the outskirts of the community. Businesses
considered the loss of proximity to the highway a major factor in the economic
decline of the village.<p>
<p>
The site chosen and purchased was not the best for solar. Split by the highway,
the portion furthest from the old village was well situated for solar heating.
But the portion closest to the old sections of the community and chosen for
retail business development  was partially obstructed by two 300-foot hills on
its southern edge. To make matters worse, the hills were topped by 50- to
60-foot trees.<p>
<p>
<b>Local Barriers</b><p>
<p>
As for the barriers presented by existing local ordinances, Soldiers Grove had
few pertaining to construction, land use or other issues with a bearing on
solar. Since it had experienced little development in recent years, there had
been no need for regulation other than floodplain zoning.<p>
<p>
However, state building codes for residential and commercial structures did
apply in the village, and the village had no legal mechanism for assuring solar
access. Village officials would have to come up with solar access regulation of
some kind. As for the state building codes, they seemed not to contain any
obvious barriers to solar. Village officials decided any obstructions contained
in the codes could not be detected until specific building designs had been
proposed.<p>
<p>
Attitudinal barriers also existed in the community. Coordinator Hirsch
described the general opinion of solar heating as "healthy
skepticism" when the idea was first raised. Many of the villagers
subscribed to the standard myths -- that solar wouldn't work in a
northern climate, that it was risky, exotic and high-priced. There was also
concern that with the trauma of the relocation project already taxing their
courage, villagers might be reluctant to change further. Village leaders feared
the citizenry might quickly reach a psychological threshold beyond which it was
no longer willing to innovate.<p>
<p>
<b>Positive Attitudes</b><p>
<p>
But the CDO staff knew from formal surveys of villagers' values in the
past, and from countless hours of talking with the people, that there were
several attitudes which might make solar particularly appealing. First the
Kickapoogians were a ruggedly independent lot, very much attracted to
self-sufficiency. Local lore had it that during one flood, the villagers asked
the Red Cross to leave town, saying they could take care of their own. Insofar
as it would allow the village more independence and self-sufficiency, solar
would be attractive.<p>
Secondly, there was a strong environmental ethic in the village. Though
villagers often seemed to take the pristine beauty of the Valley for granted,
surveys showed that environmental quality was very high on the list of their
priorities for the future. Solar was saleable as an environmentally benign way
to heat the new downtown.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, there was a strong desire to improve the economic health of the
community. If solar systems could be shown to be inexpensive to install and
operate, yet beneficial to the local economy, there would likely be support for
their use.<p>
<p>
All in all, the local assessment of solar potential at Soldiers Grove indicated
to Hirsch and other village leaders that solar heating and other alternative
energy systems ought to be seriously explored, and should be considered a high
priority in planning for the move.<p>
<p>
<b>Technical Input</b><p>
<p>
Having established that priority, Hirsch put out a call for assistance late in
the fall of 1978. The village had proposed the project in 1975 and had been
trying to push it forward for years; now, suddenly, local leaders were under
tremendous pressure to begin the move. Their buildings damaged by flooding,
some of them beyond repair, business owners were anxious for construction to
begin.<p>
Hirsch and CDO director Ron Swiggum made a difficult decision. They would begin
the relocation of 10 residences from the floodprone downtown immediately. But
the purchase of existing businesses and the start of construction of the new
business district would wait until the spring of 1979, after the village had
time to perform final planning of the development.<p>
<p>
Hirsch contacted the U.S. Department of Energy's Region V office in
Chicago to appeal for assistance in analyzing the community's energy
choices. That office contacted the Wisconsin Division of State Energy (DSE),
which in turn contacted the Wisconsin Energy Extension Service (WEES), a
federally funded energy education project within the University of
Wisconsin-Extension (UWEX).<p>
<p>
The WEES allocated half its assistant director's time for three months to
head a task force of state and federal agencies which would carry out an energy
study for the community. Answering the call to take part in the study were
specialists from the UWEX Department of Engineering and Applied Science, the
Division of State Energy and, at the request of the Department of Energy,
Argonne National Laboratory. Representatives of the electric utility serving
Soldiers Grove also were invited to take part.<p>
<p>
The task force began its work early in January 1979. The involvement of the
state and university specialists was financed by their agencies as a public
service. Argonne assigned two engineers and a community planning specialist to
the project, folding it into an existing program, the Integrated Community
Energy Systems project, at no cost to the village.<p>
<p>
Argonne's engineers, accustomed to large, high-technology projects, balked
initially at the Soldiers Grove challenge. The square footage involved at the
village was little more than that for a standard shopping center. Nevertheless,
Argonne agreed to take the technical lead in analyzing the village's
options, with other task force participants acting as devil's advocates.<p>
<p>
Argonne performed a two-step analysis, first considering dozens of energy
systems representing a wide range of technologies. Solar ponds, photovoltaics,
active solar collectors and a host of more experimental options were given at
least cursory attention.<p>
<p>
Argonne rejected many of these technologies for a variety of reasons. Some were
too costly. Some were too unproven to be used safely in a real-life situation.
Other technologies, though proven and safe, simply would take too long to
implement. The community needed heating energy immediately in the new
downtown.<p>
<p>
In addition, because the village was receiving funding for the move a little at
a time, construction of the new downtown was to be incremental. The new energy
system would have to be flexible enough to serve incremental needs and to
remain economical even if federal funding dried up, allowing only some of the
businesses to make the move.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Recommendations</b><p>
<p>
Argonne finally boiled the options down to 12 which would be given more
detailed analysis. Included were conventional furnaces, two types of wind
turbine use, three types of heat pump use, two types of central heating systems
fired by oil, two types of diesel generators providing both electricity and
heat, and two types of wood-fired central heating plants. The laboratory's
analysis indicated that a central heating plant fueled by wood wastes and using
steam as its distribution medium would be the village's most economical
choice.<p>
<p>
Throughout the study, the WEES chairperson coordinated the energy investigation
with three other technical assistance efforts carried out by UWEX. At a cost of
roughly $10,000 to the village, Extension had assigned faculty members to
advise the community on a master plan for the new downtown, zoning and other
legal tools which might be employed to guide development, and economic
counseling for individual business owners to help them in their planning. The
chairperson found that it was necessary to carefully monitor and prod the
agencies involved in the energy study, keeping them moving according the
village's exceedingly short time table.<p>
<p>
In March 1979, the energy task force issued a report to the village containing
four recommendations. First, the new commercial structures should be designed
for maximum economical thermal efficiency. Second the village should construct
a central wood-fired heating plant to serve as the major source of heating
energy for the downtown. Third, passive solar heating systems should be used to
provide back-up to the central plant. And finally, the village should continue
exploring ways to use the other native, renewable energy sources it had found
in its assessment.<p>
<p>
<b>Local Decisions</b><p>
<p>
Meanwhile, business owners decided they would like the design of their
buildings coordinated to make the downtown as attractive as possible. At the
same time, there were no legal mechanisms  to guide construction. Individual
owners could construct any kind of building they wished, utilizing any type of
energy system. Business owners were unwilling to turn the project over to an
outside developer who would oversee design and construction.<p>
<p>
UWEX specialists advising the community on zoning recommended that the village
take advantage of municipal ownership of the site and declare it a Planned Unit
Development (PUD) district. Under that arrangement, the village could devise a
master plan setting out construction standards, energy efficiency standards,
building placement and other critical guidelines. If approved in public
hearings and by the Village Board, the PUD plan would have the force of zoning.
Thus, in effect, the village government would serve as developer of the
downtown, an arrangement that was favored by business owners.<p>
<p>
The two leaders allocated a portion of the village's initial $900,000 HUD
grant to hire a private firm expert at fashioning PUD plans. Now thoroughly
committed to solar, they drew up a list of 20 architectural firms which the
village would consider for three tasks: the design of three municipal
structures; the refining of the site layout to accommodate solar heating; and
the development of that portion of the PUD plan concerning the use of energy.
Twelve firms responded to the village's request for proposals.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Refining the Recommendations</b><p>
<p>
After interviewing four firms, the Village Board hired Hawkweed Group Ltd., a
pioneer in solar building design in the Midwest. Hawkweed introduced the board
to the startling claim that site-built solar heating systems could be
incorporated into the new business buildings at virtually no extra cost to
building owners. And the systems would typically provide 75 percent or more of
the annual space and water heating energy needed for each building.<p>
<p>
If Hawkweed was correct, the energy task force had underestimated the potential
of energy-efficient design and solar heating. Indeed, as Hawkweed began formal
studies and planning for the village, its estimates indicated that thermal
efficiency and passive solar would probably make a central wood-fired heating
system uneconomical. The plant and its expensive distribution pipes throughout
the business district simply would not get enough use to pay for themselves.<p>
<p>
Given Hawkweed's input, the Community Development Office modified the
energy guidelines submitted by the task force. Buildings would be designed for
maximum thermal efficiency, with passive solar systems serving as the main
sources of heating energy. For backup, building owners would be encouraged to
install small conventional furnaces fired by LP gas. <p>
