Notes of Tracy Crook's talk "Mazda Performance Update" at
Sun-N-Fun on 15 April 96

I attended several Forums ate Sun-N-Fun, and took notes which I
thought I might share.  I was principally interested in Mazda
Rotarys as a potential replacement for an io-360-a1a.  Below are
my notes of Crooks's Forum.  He has taken a conservative
approach, and come up with a 160Hp engine which looks likely to
be highly reliable.  Please understand that these are my notes
of his talk and may contain errors, and even if I took accurate
notes, I can't vouch for Crook's claims.

His engine is installed in an RV-4.  It is 934 lbs empty and has
a top speed of 200+.  The airframe is stock, including cowling.

The weak spot in the Mazda wankel basic design is the apex
sealing.  Mazda has had an acceptable solution to sealing since
1972.

Crook's goal was to match the power to weight ratio of a
Lycoming o-320, beat its cost and produce a solution in 6 months.

An o-320 has a published weight of 276lbs + accessories.
An o-320 weighs 355-385lbs all up minus the prop.
Crooks' Mazda weighs 340lbs all up minus the prop.

Note that published aircraft engine weights do not include many
systems and accessories and do not represent the all up weight
of the installed engine.

A overhauled o-320 goes for $8,000.00.  Crook built his engine
for $5,2200.00 and could easily best that price if he did it
again.

His engine is basically stock.  He made changes principally to
eliminate features that are obviously for automotive purposes. 
Principally to reduce emissions or to increase low end torque. 
Neither of which is needed for the aircraft application.

He made no changes that would increase BMEP since BMEP scales
with internal stress and high relyability was his goal rather
than high performance.

You should ask for coils and cooling parts for your engine at
the salvage yard [or better yet arrange to remove the engine
yourself].  These are not mounted to the engine and you save a
lot by having them included in the price of a salvaged engine.

He looked at a wide variety of engines and developed a short
list of o-320 replacements as follows:  Honda Prelude, Subaru
2.2l Legacy, and Mazda 13B.

The 13B has a higher fuel burn.  Crook vigured the increased
cost of auto fuel over the life of the engine was acceptable.

He burns 8.2 gph at 192 mph or at 75% power.
He usually cruises at 150 mph and burns 5.2 gph.

The crank (eccentric) shaft of the 13B is STOUT.  Crook has
heard of no failures of this part, even in auto racing.  The
rotors are also heavily built and are not prone to fail.

Redrives:  Powersport and Ross were discussed.  Crook mentioned
the problem that there are a lot of redrives marketed, but only
some vendors have actual stock developed and waiting to ship. 
Some are really still in the development phase. Crook used a
Ross unit.  The Ross unit uses a torsional isolating plate like
in an auto clutch.  The Ross unit uses the Ford C-6 planetary
gearset.  Powersport strives to eliminate gear lash [Everitt
Hatch in a seperate forum described their approach to torsional
resonance issues as one based on increasing the stiffness of the
system and thereby driving the harmonics up out of the
opperating range].  The Powersport costs 3 times as much as the
Ross unit.  The Ross installation guide calls for turning the
engine 90 degrees about the crank axis.  They probably did this
in order to stick the distributor out the side and keep it in
the cowl.  If you use an electronic fuel injection system
there's no reason to rotate the engine.  Crook mounted his
engine upright and beleives that this will help cooling since
1/3 of engine heat leaves via the oil cooler and the oil was
ment to drain down by Mazda.

Fuel System:  The stock fuel injection system is bulkey, and
unneseccarily complex for an aircraft application.  It is
designed to reduce emissions and to increase low end torque. 
Crook disregarded this and instead used three motorcycle carbs. 
In selecting the carbs he observed the following rules.  1) all
carbs mix fuel in the same ratio 2) in general you need 1 square
inch of carb throat for each 50Hp.  You might need more area on
an engine with especially short sharp intake breaths, but the
Mazda makes a long smooth inhale.  He used three carbs for the
simple reason that he had three sets of holes on the block to
cover.

By using three carbs he gains the added benifit of induction
redundancy.  Ehe engine will run at reduced Hp on the center
carb alone, or on the outside carbs together without the center
carb.

Ignition:  On a 1985 or earlier engine, the stock distributor
will work even if the engine had electronic ignition.  The Mazda
comes stock with two plugs per combustion chamber so it seems a
shame to abandon the opportunity to have completely redundant
ignition.  Having discarded the stock EFI the stock electronic
ignition went with it, so a new ignition system was called for. 
Crook is an electronics guy by trade so he developed his own
ignition modules. ( he will sell them at close to cost)

Cooling:  Center of Gravity considerations precluded adding a
belly scoop for radiators.  Crook used the empty space in the
RV-4s cheek cowls for his radiators.  He used automotive
airconditioning evaporator colers as radiators "they're not the
best radiators you can buy, but they're the best $5.00 radiators
you can buy."  The rotors are oil cooled and 1/3 of total engine
heat leaves by way of the oil.  It is essential to keep oil temp
below 210 degrees (measured after the oil cooler).  Otherwise
you will degrade the rubber oil seals on the sides of the
rotors.  Crook used the standard Mazda oil cooler.  Later
engines have an electric cooling oil bypass valve for the rotor
cooling.  This is to warm the engine up faster to reduce
emissions.  Failure of this valve could lead to grief.  Remove
it.

Exhaust:  The exhaust temp is about 200 degrees hotter than in a
piston engine.  Crook used 1-3/4 inch 321 stainless steel for
his exhaust.  He fiddled with tuning the exhaust, but at the Hp
he will be operating he found no significant advantage and
installed an untuned exhaust.  For 1986 engines or later an
engine installed in the car with a turbo can be run without the
turbo.  Crook recomends 1986 or later engines.  The engine is
LOUD without a muffler, but is quite quiet with a muffler
installed.

Intake:  Many Mazda's will tune intake.  Crook didn't.  His
intake runners are less than an inch.  The stock Mazda engine
has a valve within the block in the intakes that will restrict
flow under certain conditions to accelerate flow and improve low
end torque.  This is not needed in the aircraft and a failed
valve could cause engine damage.   Crook glued these open with
high temp epoxy.

The gasket in the rebuild kit is thicker than the one from the
factory.  The oil sealing o-ring isn't.  This spaces the faces
farther apart and leads to failure of the o-ring.  Crook says to
disregard the gasket and use standard gasket glop instead.

Crook now published a newsletter on Mazda conversion, and also a
manual on his conversion.  He will also sell ignition modules.

His planes's number is N84TC.
