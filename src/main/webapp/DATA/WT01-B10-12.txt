When an Agatha Christie mystery begins to unfold, at first the investigator suspects every character of having committed the crime. As the plot unwinds, however, our hero gradually pieces together one shred of evidence after another, until, in the final climactic scene, the master investigator pinpoints the culprit.<p>
There's little difference between conducting this kind of investigation and doing a fertility evaluation. When a woman first comes to my office, I suspect a broad range of causes: tubal blockage, endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, uterine abnormalities, anovulation, and so forth. As I review her history, I search for clues that will help me narrow my list of suspects. Repeated pelvic infections, for example, lead me to suspect tubal blockage or pelvic adhesions. If she tells me she's not menstruating, I'll focus my investigation on hormonal problems or uterine abnormalities. If she complains of extreme discomfort when her period starts, endometriosis will be uppermost in my thoughts.<p>
Just as the master detective can be thrown off by misleading evidence, I must also be cautious not to jump to conclusions. It's all too easy to say, "Pain at menstrual onset? You have endometriosis." Although this may be correct, endometriosis may not be the only offender. Intrauterine adhesions or hormonal imbalances may also play a part.<p>
The challenge presented by contradictory clues can seem overwhelming Just as I think I'm about to close in on one suspect, I uncover evidence that doesn't seem to fit the pattern. With my theory blown out of the water, I must formulate a new strategy for tracking down the culprit. By analyzing the clues and continually searching for additional ones, I draw closer and closer to the solution until I reach the climactic day when I tell you that you are pregnant.<p>
Lucy H., for example, had infrequent periods and pain with intercourse. Ovulation induction therapy had regulated her periods but she'd failed to get pregnant. When her doctor referred her to me, I performed a laparoscopy (telescopic examination of the inside of her pelvis) and discovered that she had endometriosis and that adhesions (scar tissue) encased her ovaries. Even if she had ovulated, her eggs could not have reached her fallopian tubes.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<h2 align=center>The Five Female Fertility Factors</h2>

The five key elements of female fertility are:<p>
<dl>
<dd><img align=top src="grey.gif">   Ovulation<p>
<dd><img align=top src="grey.gif">   Sperm-mucus interaction<p>
<dd><img align=top src="grey.gif">   Fertilization<p>
<dd><img align=top src="grey.gif">   Tubal transport<p>
<dd><img align=top src="grey.gif">   Embryo implantation<p></dl>
During the physical examination and fertility workup, I attempt to confirm or eliminate each of these candidates as hindrances to your fertility. Your history may point strongly to some of them. The clues I gather during the physical examination will offer additional evidence. Once I've pinpointed the areas of greatest concern, I can recommend specific tests and procedures to confirm my diagnosis. For now, though, I'd like to discuss what clues I can gather from the physical examination.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2><center><img align=center src="mb101.gif"></center><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<h2 align=center>The Physical Examination</h2>

During the physical examination I look for evidence that you are ovulating, that your mucus allows sperm to reach the egg in good shape, and that the fertilized egg can successfully implant and grow in your uterus. A number of things may go wrong during this process. The sperm may not be able to journey through inhospitable cervical mucus or, having reached the egg, they may be unable to penetrate its surface. The egg may get lost in the body cavity and never find its way into the fallopian tube. Fallopian tubes, damaged by infection or trapped in adhesions, may not be capable of moving the egg toward the uterus. The growing, fertilized egg may become entangled in webs of intratubal adhesions caused by infection and develop into an ectopic pregnancy. Or the uterine lining may fail to nourish the early embryo. Once I determine where these processes are breaking down, I have a good chance of restoring your fertility.<p>
<b>Fertility Factor #1: Ovulation</b><br>

Any woman who comes to me complaining of very heavy menstrual flow, very light menstrual flow, no menstrual flow, irregular cycles, breast discharge, or scanty or overabundant body hair growth is telling me that she may not be ovulating. This may be due to an intrinsic malfunction of her reproduc-tive organs or hormones, or to a systemic disease causing other body chemistry problems.<p>
During the physical examination I look for evidence of systemic disease: jaundiced (yellow) skin and eyes are indicative of liver disease; tenderness in the middle of the back and water retention (edema) may indicate kidney malfunction.<p>
Nancy F., for example, had been trying to get pregnant for six months. When I examined her, I found that her ankles and fingers were swollen. Further tests indicated that her kidneys were not functioning well. I referred her to a kidney specialist, since once her kidney function improved, her periods would probably return to normal.<p>
Since your liver and kidneys filter impurities from your blood (including "old" hormones), their function is vital for maintaining hormonal balance. If I find high blood pressure together with excessive body hair, I may suspect - adrenal gland abnormalities, which can affect ovarian function. (I discuss more about how we diagnose and correct these problems in the chapters on - ovulation.) I also look for other clues pointing to ovulation problems. For example, if you weigh over two hundred pounds, if you're severely underweight, or if; you have a highly developed athletic build, I may suspect a hormonal imbalance. Kathy S., who ran fifteen to twenty miles a week, had leg muscles; a man would be proud of. It didn't take much imagination to know that she was exercising to the point that she would cause ovulatory failure. (Chapter 9 explains the mechanisms for these disorders.)<p>
When I examined Dorothy L., I found that her thyroid gland was swollen, and she appeared lethargic. Suspecting a thyroid deficiency, I ordered a thyroid hormone blood test. After she began taking a thyroid supplement, she became more energetic, had much more interest in having sex with her husband, and her periods returned to normal. Five months later she called to tell me she was pregnant.<p>
Both hyperthyroidism (overproduction of thyroid hormone) and hypothy-roidism (underproduction) may interfere with your menstrual cycle by dis-turbing estrogen supplies. I'll discuss more about how your hormonal system works in chapters <a href="ch11mb.html">11</a>, <a href="ch12mb.html">12</a>, and <a href="ch13mb.html">13</a>.<p>
When I examined Gale P., I found that she had a translucent, white discharge from her breasts. She said that she'd had a milky discharge ever since she'd stopped nursing her toddler. I suspected she was producing excess prolactin, a hormone usually associated with nursing mothers. This hormone prevents ovulation and pregnancy so that you can give your baby the best nutrition possible. When you're trying to get pregnant, however, you don't need prolactin's birth control protection. With treatment, Gale's fertility quickly returned.<p>
Your body build and secondary sex characteristics may provide additional clues to hormonal imbalance. Undersized breasts, scanty pubic hair, and underdeveloped hips all suggest a female hormone deficiency. An enlarged clitoris and abnormal hair growth such as a mustache may suggest excess male hormones. Rarer conditions such as ambiguous genitalia (not clearly male or female) and duplicate reproductive organs may point to genetic or enzyme defects that can interfere with ovulation. Although breast size, body conformation, and hair distribution are not conclusive evidence, they may corroborate suspicions created by other clues.<p>
If your menstrual history and evidence from your physical examination point to ovulatory problems, I will recommend a number of tests to confirm this diagnosis. Like the detective, I need corroborative evidence to prove my case. <a href="ch11mb.html">Chapters 11</a> through <a href="ch14mb.html">14</a> describe in detail what can cause ovulatory problems and how, with treatment, most women with ovulatory disorders can get their miracle babies.<p>

<b>Fertility Factor  #2: Sperm-Mucus Interaction</b><br>
Normally your cervical mucus forms an impervious plug that keeps foreign materials, including sperm, from entering the uterus. Once each month, responding to estrogen, the cervical mucus becomes clear, thin, and stringy so sperm can swim through the cervix into the uterus.<p>
I'll examine your cervix to make sure that the mucus has not been degraded by infection, by a cone biopsy to remove abnormal precancerous tissue, by cryosurgery, or by cervical deformities from congenital defects or DES exposure (as in Debbie W.'s cervix). In part IV, "<a href="ch15mb.html">When Sperm Meets Egg</a>," I'll explain how I diagnose and treat sperm-mucus problems.<p>
Since bacteria, viruses, white blood cells, and antibodies may attack and impair the sperm, a number of different vaginal and cervical infections can cause fertility problems. Some wave red flags in the form of pus (purulent discharge), inflammation, itching, burning, and foul odors, but many of the more insidious varieties can be detected only by special laboratory tests.<p>
Minor infections include candidiasis or yeast, which may be uncomfortable and itchy; trichomonas, which may produce a bad-smelling greenish discharge; gardnerella infection, which causes a burning sensation and a gray, pasty discharge; and ureaplasma infection, which is symptomless. A microscopic examination of the discharge will disclose the identity of the invading organism. Once antibiotics eradicate these infections, fertility may improve.<p>
Infections such as chlamydia, ureaplasma, and gonorrhea occasionally cause severe illness leading to tubal blockage and the formation of adhesions, often without the victim knowing it. Diagnosis is difficult, since the only evidence may be a reddened vagina or a burning sensation and urgency to urinate. In the presence of an abnormal cervical discharge, I will test for all of these organisms.<p>
Janice D.'s laparoscopy, for example, revealed that she had extensive pelvic adhesions. When I questioned her, the only incident she could recall was a flulike illness she'd had during her junior year at college. She and her physician had never realized she was suffering from a chlamydia infection. It was six years later, when she couldn't get pregnant, that she received the diagnosis.<p>
By causing an inflammation of the uterine lining, ureaplasma (often called mycoplasma) may lead to early miscarriage. When this sexually transmitted infection is found in the woman, it will probably be in her partner, too. When ureaplasma occurs in the man, he may form antibodies which attack his own sperm. Since the symptoms for this disease are as elusive as those for chlamydia, only a culture can help me diagnose it.<p>
Gonorrhea is usually symptomless in the woman, although in some cases it causes a bad-smelling yellowish discharge and red and swollen vaginal walls, and if it invades your tubes, you'll suffer severe pain and develop a high fever.<p>
In the presence of infertility I always culture for this organism because, once detected, I can often restore fertility with the antibiotic doxycycline.<p>
During the vaginal examination I will also note if you appear to be having an abnormally high level of discomfort. This sometimes indicates psychological problems which could interfere with having intercourse. Since you are fertile for only forty-eight hours each month and sperm survive for only forty-eight hours in your reproductive tract, infrequent intercourse may play a role in your fertility problem.<p>

<b>Fertility Factor #3: Fertilization</b><br>
Fertilization depends on the sperm's ability to penetrate the outer layers of the egg and transfer its genetic information. Since I cannot determine if fertilization is working properly from the physical examination, I must use the sperm penetration assay or the acrosin test, which are explained in <a href="ch18mb.html">chapter 18</a>.<p>

<b>Fertility Factor #4: Tubal Factor</b><br>
Other clues uncovered during the physical examination may point to transport problems. Abdominal scars, for example, could indicate that sur-gery might have caused adhesions to form. Margaret B. had an appendec-tomy scar from a ruptured appendix. Since the massive infection and surgery could have caused tubal blockage, I did a <a href="inciidwu.hml#hsg">tubal X ray</a> right away.<p>
Abdominal adhesions can prevent the egg from entering the fallopian tube as well as impede its passage through the tube. I have seen many women whose tubes were frozen in place by this nonstretchable tissue preventing the tubal movement necessary to coax the egg toward the uterus. During the pelvic examination I manipulate your reproductive organs to detect if they move freely or if they feel like rigid, plaster models. I can often restore fertility to women with adhesions by surgically removing this scar tissue. I'll discuss these procedures in <a href="ch16mb.html">chapters 16</a> and <a href="ch17mb.html">17</a>.<p><img align=right src="endo3.gif">
Wincing, tenderness, and pain during the pelvic examination may indicate an active infection, <a endometriosis, ovarian cysts, tumors, adhesions, fibroids (leiomyomata), or bladder infection. If your ovaries are enlarged or tender, I'll suspect an infection or that you're ovulating irregularly.<p>
Endometriosis can cause adhesions and impair ovulation. Sometimes I can detect endometriosis during the vaginal and rectal examination; however, just as Sherlock Holmes pulled out his magnifying glass to get a closer view of the evidence, I often must confirm the diagnosis with a laparoscopy. When I examined Shelley T., I could feel the tell-tale beading or bumps on the surface of her reproductive organs and supporting uterine ligaments, but I followed up with a laparoscopy to confirm my diagnosis. Endometriosis may respond to medication or, failing that, surgery. I'll discuss more about endometriosis in <a href="ch17mb.html">chapter 17</a>.<p>
Depending on their size and location, fibroids and ovarian cysts can also interfere with egg transport. These conditions will usually respond to surgery.<p>
Remember that having open tubes isn't the whole answer. If infection has stripped the hairlike cilia from the tubal lining, the egg may not be able to complete its journey toward the uterus. Detecting tubal problems during the physical examination is very unlikely; only an X ray can confirm that diagnosis. By combining the clues from your history and from the physical examination, I can decide if sperm/egg transportation might be contributing to your problem. A complete discussion of testing and procedures for tubal transport problems appears in <a href="ch16mb.html">chapters 16</a> and <a href="ch17mb.html">17</a>.<p>
<b>Fertility Factor #5: Embryo Implantation</b><br>
Sometimes during the physical examination I detect obvious causes for miscarriage such as congenitally malformed reproductive organs, an abnormally shaped cervix evident of DES exposure, or a cervix distorted by previous surgical procedures. Most of the time, however, the physical examination will not reveal the exact causes for recurrent miscarriage. The tests specific to this and other disorders causing pregnancy loss are covered in complete detail in <a href="ch18mb.html">chapters 18</a> and <a href="ch19mb.html">19</a>.<p>

<b>Standard Laboratory Tests</b><br>
As part of the physical examination, I order a number of laboratory tests. <a href="#table1>Table 1</a> profiles the ones I use and what they tell me.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<h2 align=center>The Postevaluation Conference</h2>

The postevaluation conference I have with my patients reminds me of the meeting between the chief of detectives and his team to plan the final strategy for solving the mystery. Step by step the chief outlines the plan, so each person knows exactly how to play out his or her role. He also outlines contingency plans to deal with obstacles and unexpected events. And even with all this forethought and effort, sometimes the suspect isn't where they expect him to be; sometimes the suspect escapes; and sometimes the suspect turns out to be innocent.<p>
As "chief of detectives," once I have collected all the clues from my investigation—your history, your physical examination, and your laboratory tests—I begin to outline a strategy for treating your fertility problem. I may not know the exact cause of your infertility, but I can customize the investigation to uncover the most likely problem. If I suspect ovulatory problems, as I did with Kathy S., I will want to evaluate the menstrual cycle. If I suspect tubal blockage, as I did with Margaret B., I will order an X ray. If I suspect an infection, I'll recommend antibiotic therapy. Or if I find poor semen quality, I'll want to evaluate your husband more thoroughly. As I get closer and closer to the answer, I begin to put together my strategy for eliminating your fertility problem.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>

<h2 align=center><i>The lnitial Workup</i></h2>
<h2 align=center>Laboratory Tests I Often Perform</h2><p>

<b>Cultures/DNA Probe:</b> Cultures for sexually transmitted infections reveal the presence of active infections which must be treated prior to initiating other fertility treatment. It's mandatory that the woman's partner be treated for the same infection, since bacteria are easily passed back and forth between sexual partners. Recently tests called DNA probes can detect chlamydia and gonorrhea from a simple smear taken from the cerivx.<p>
<b> <a href="d3fsh.html">Day 3 FSH:</a> </b>In those women over 35 I recommend this blood test to determine ovarian status. <p> 
<b>VDRL: </b>This test rules out the presence of syphilis, which may affect the fetus as well as pose a serious health hazard to you.<p>
<b>HIV & Hepatitis Screening: </b>Testing for the AIDS virus and hepatitis may be done as part of your initial evaluation.<p>
<b><a href="http://oncolink.upenn.edu/pdq/600516.html">Pap Smear:</a></b> Although not specific to fertility problems, a Pap smear should be performed during every workup to eliminate the possibility that you have or may soon develop cancer of the reproductive organs.<p>
<b>CBC: </b>A complete blood count will give a reading on your general health. It will also indicate if you have an infection, systemic disease, or iron deficiency.<p>
<b>Urinalysis:</b> This test will help rule out renal disease or genitourinary tract infections as potential fertility problems.<p>
<b>Prolactin:</b> This test is likely to be abnormal if you have irregular periods or note a clear or milky breast discharge.<p>
<b>Thyroid Hormone:</b> I run this test if the physical exam suggests hyper- or hypothyroidism .<p>
<b>Testosterone, DHEAS, 17 Hydroxyprogesterone, & Fasting Insulin:</b> These tests may be helpful if you have irregular periods and excessive hair growth.<p>
<b>Sed Rate:</b> The sedimentation rate in your blood will often reveal an infection when cultures show up negative.<p>
<b>Rubella Titre:</b> I always test for immunity to German measles, since con-tracting this disease during a pregnancy often leads to severe deformities in the fetus.<p>
<b>Sickle Cell Screen:</b> If you are Black, this test will indicate if you are at risk of having a child with sickle cell anemia.<p>
<b><a href="ch6mb.html">Semen Analysis</a>:</b> Your workup is not complete until your husband's semen has been evaluated. Performing extensive testing and treatment on you will be to no avail if he is not contributing adequate sperm.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>

You, as a couple, are part of my assault team. Without your input, understanding and participation, my efforts will fail. you will decide how much of your resources you are willing or able to spend, and how long you want to pursue your goal. Together we'll decide how aggressively to attack the problem. Margaret and Richard B. knew that due to Margaret's age they had only a few fertile years left. They had good insurance coverage, so they wanted to check everything out as soon as possible, with money as no object. Shelley and Michael T., in contrast, had already been through a year or more of tests, had many bills to pay, and Michael was feeling so pressured that he was ready to quit entirely. They chose to proceed more slowly—one step at a time. The fertility treatment plan we worked out for these two couples differed considerably.<p>
To help you understand the types of decisions you may be facing, the next chapters will cover specific tests and treatments for the five main suspects in female infertility.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
