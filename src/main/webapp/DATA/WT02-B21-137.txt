<I><B><FONT SIZE=5>Modern Gypsies Buy Land!!!</FONT></B><BR>
(the following was printed in a Harare, Zimbabwe newspaper)</I><BR>
....Mike & Sonja Messick, better known as "Modern day Gypsies", bought land in Zimbabwe.  On the northeast outskirts of the capital, Harare, in the area known as Umwinsidale.  heir 10 acre plot overlooks the Shamva Valley and is situated on a side of Turtle Hill known by locals as Kamba Hill.  The land borders the couple’s parents estate of 85 acres.  It is rumored that they will build a small, up-scale market lodge.<BR>

As some of you may remember, Taylor Ricketts left our shipboard staff a year ago in order to pursue his long-held graduate school plans.  After a year of applying to programs and working at World Wildlife Fund, he reports that he will be heading to Stanford University in September to begin a Ph.D. program in Conservation Biology.  He will be working with Paul Ehrlich, whom he met on a Stanford Alumni Association/ Zegrahm Expeditions excursion to Antarctica in 1993!  The National Science Foundation seems to be as impressed as we are, because they have awarded him a very prestigious and coveted Graduate Fellowship to fund his research.  Good luck Taylor!<BR>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>Still have travel time in September?</FONT></I></B><BR>
Our expedition to the <I><B>Canyon Country of the American Southwest</B></I> has just a few spaces available.  No visa is required, and a domestic airline ticket is all you need to experience one of the richest natural and cultural history areas in this country during the best time of the year!  This is a <I>Last Chance</I> expedition, so call Tony today for further information and to reserve one of the remaining spaces.<BR>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>Congratulations Shirley!</FONT></I></B><BR>
In May of this year, Zegrahm co-founder Shirley Metz was elected to membership in the prestigious <I>Society of Woman Geographers.</I>  This international organization is comprised of widely traveled women interested in exploration, who have carried out research and field activities in their particular disciplines.  As the first woman to travel overland to the South Pole in 1988-89, Shirley has continued working on environmental issues for Antarctica and spends several weeks a year co-leading expeditions for our exploration of the icy continent.<BR>
One of SWG’s founding members was Amelia Earhart.  Other members, past and present, are Dorothy Schweitzer, Virginia B. Ball, Edith "Jackie" Ronne, Mary Livingston Ripley, Mary Leakey and Sylvia Earle.<BR>

<B><I><FONT SIZE=5><I><B>Snorkel Corner</B> by Jack Grove</I></FONT></I></B><BR>
There are few places in the "underwater" world which can compete with the reefs surroun-ding most of Indonesia's 13,565 islands.  Not only is the diversity of fish mind boggling, but multi-colored corals, large sponges and sea fans - not to mention many vertical wall drop offs - combine to make these waters one of my favorite snorkeling and diving destinations.<BR>

On our Ikats, Reefs and Dragons expedition next September, we will have lots of opportunities to snorkel and dive in the crystal clear waters of the Flores and Banda Seas.  We plan to explore the islands of Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, Flores, Lomblem, Alor, Wetar, Lucipara and Banda in the "cool and fresh" hours of the morning, afternoons are usually set aside for snorkeling and diving.  The nutrient rich waters attract a variety of cetaceans and during our last few voyages we encountered spinner dolphins (lot's), pilot, sperm, and Cuvier's beaked whales. On one trip even the rare blue whale made an appearance!<BR>
