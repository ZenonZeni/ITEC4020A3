<H2>Cogen, Natural Gas Offer Opportunities For Power Investors</H2>
<P>Energy liberalization in Mexico remains a highly uneven process, but
programs to increase efficiency and reduce power-related environmental hazards
point to promising openings for domestic and foreign investors, particularly in
the areas of cogeneration and greater use of natural gas.  </P>
<P>Efforts to increase cogeneration and natural gas use have grown considerably
during the 19 months of President Ernesto Zedillo's administration. Cogeneration
has represented a particular challenge. Legal reforms passed in 1992 and 1993
permitted establishment of privately financed cogeneration plants, which supply
both the generators' needs and the national grid. However, Mexico's economic
recession then stalled many projects in the planning stages. Also delaying
progress was a lack of clarity concerning the role of the federal electricity
commission (CFE) in such privately financed plants.</P>
<H2>Altamira Breakthrough</H2>
<P>Then, on July 4, energy secretary Jesus Reyes Heroles announced Mexico's
first big cogeneration project: a $72 million, 120 MW gas-fired plant with a
capacity of 36,000 kg of steam an hour, to be built in Altamira, in the northern
state of Tamaulipas. The plant, which is being constructed by <B>ICA-Fluor
Daniel,</B> should begin operations in the first quarter of 1998.</P>
<H2>Wide Reach</H2>
<P>Overseeing plant operations is <B>Enertek,</B> a newly formed joint venture
that received a government license to build and operate the plant. Enertek's
partners are a subsidiary of Dallas-based electricity company <B>Central and
South West</B> and Mexico's <B>Alpek,</B> the petrochemical wing of the<B>Alfa</B>
conglomerate. The plant will provide energy for states in Mexico's northern and
central regions, supply Enertek's and Alfa's own needs, and also serve
subsidiaries of companies such as <B>Shell</B> and <B>Hercules.</B> According
to estimates from Alfa, the plant should provide energy savings equivalent to a
million barrels of petroleum a year.</P>
<P>The project was preceded by arduous negotiations. These dealt with the price
of natural gas provided by state oil monopoly <B>Pemex,</B> the price set for
purchase of excess electricity by the CFE and the CFE's provision of emergency
electricity in the case of plant failure. They also involved the first energy
transmission contract signed with a private company in Mexico.  </P></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="300">
<H2>Pointing The Way</H2>
<P>If the solutions devised in the Altamira contract negotiations are
successful, cogeneration should pick up speed. According to Mexico's national
commission for the conservation of energy, cogeneration represents the country's
most important energy savings opportunity. Some 7,000 MW &#150; a fifth of
current generating capacity &#150; could be produced by using steam or heat
already produced by the country's industries. &quot;Cogeneration is tremendously
important in energy efficiency because it taps energy sources that would
otherwise remain unexploited,&quot; said Mateo Trevino, head of the government's
fund for energy efficiency (FIDE). &quot;The expertise of foreign companies
could obviously help many Mexican companies to take advantage of this potential,&quot;
Trevino said.</P>
<H2>Gas Use To Grow</H2>
<P>The Zedillo's administration's other &#150; and longer standing &#150; 
success in the field of environmentally conscious energy programs has been the
liberalization of the natural gas sector. According to a decree published on the
second day of the Zedillo administration, from the year 1998 onwards, the use of
fuel oil will be reduced in certain urban zones in favor of natural gas, a much
less potent pollutant. At the moment, natural gas represents 37% of all fuel
used in Mexico, while fuel oil represents 51%. The government estimates that by
2005, natural gas will represent 50%.</P>
<P>Over the last two years, natural gas production has increased by more than
600,000 cubic feet a day. Following legal changes in 1995 that allow companies
with minority foreign interest to participate in the storage, transport and
distribution of natural gas, six consortia &#150; including firms from Mexico,
the US, and Europe &#150; have entered the contest for the first such
concession, a gas distribution system in the northern border town of Mexicali (<I>P&amp;F</I>
4/96). Bidding closed in early April, but the government is not expected to
announce a winner before autumn; up to five other concessions are expected to be
granted this year. &quot;This really is one of the greatest changes in the
energy sector in recent years,&quot; said Javier Garbias, an energy adviser to
the president of Mexico's national ecology institute. &#167;</P>
<H3>AIRPORT SALES SET TO BEGIN</H3>
<P>Secretary of transport and communications Carlos Ruiz Sacristan last week
announced that the first concession to operate one of the country's airports
will be bid out this year. The Mexico City airport or the airport of Pacific
resort Puerto Vallarta will likely top the list. Concessions will be for 30
years, with several extensions allowed. Progress on airport privatizations has
been slow since congress approved the necessary legal framework last year.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
