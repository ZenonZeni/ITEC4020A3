                              U.S.
PRO-LIFE GROUP LAUDS AMA SHIFT ON ANENCEPHALIC BABIES
   STAFFORD, Va. (CNS) -- The American Life League has praised an
American Medical Association panel's suspension of a 1994 policy
statement that said doctors could harvest the organs of newborn
anencephalic babies before they died. ``I would like to commend
the American Medical Association for taking a step back into the
real world where human rights are acknowledged as belonging to all
human beings, regardless of age, state or condition of
development,'' league president Judie Brown said Dec. 28.
Anencephalic children are born with a brain stem but with no upper
brain, skull or scalp. Most die within a few days of birth,
although some have lived for months or even years. From 1988 to
1994 the AMA position was that retrieval and transplantation of
organs from anencephalic newborns was ethically permissible only
after a determination of death ``in accordance with accepted
medical standards and relevant law.''

CLOSING PARISH GIVES $400,000 TO CATHOLIC SCHOOLS
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (CNS) -- Many Catholics grieved and some
protested when Archbishop Thomas C. Kelly of Louisville announced
the closing of eight parishes in November. Members of six other
parishes originally slated to close or merge celebrated the fact
that they were to remain open as independent parishes. But one of
the closing parishes responded to the news by setting up two
$200,000 endowment funds for nearby Catholic schools. At St.
Columba, a parish of about 100 households in a working-class
neighborhood in Louisville, the pastor, Father John Caskey, and the
parish finance committee decided to use the parish's reserve funds
to help support Catholic education in the area. They gave
endowments of $200,000 each to Community Catholic (elementary)
School and Holy Cross High School, the only two Catholic schools
in the western part of Jefferson County.

BISHOP SAYS CARDINAL BROUGHT IRA PEACE PLAN TO BRITAIN IN '70s
   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (CNS) -- Retired Bishop Edward
K. Daly said an Irish cardinal acted as a go-between, passing peace
proposals from top IRA leaders to then-British Prime Minister
Harold Wilson during the 1974-75 cease-fire in Northern Ireland.
According to advance information on a documentary film scheduled
for release on Irish television Jan. 4, Bishop Daly said he and two
other bishops who met with the IRA men asked the late Cardinal
William Conway of Armagh to carry the peace plans to Wilson. The
IRA group appeared to include the organization's entire command,
Bishop Daly said. The other bishops attending the meeting were from
the Irish Republic, he said. Their names were not mentioned, nor
was the meeting site or exact date of the meeting.

INDONESIAN PARISHIONERS KILL PROTESTANT MAN WHO TOOK COMMUNION
   ATAMBUA, Indonesia (CNS) -- Parishioners at Immaculate
Conception Cathedral in Atambua beat a Protestant man to death
after he allegedly received Communion during a cathedral service.
Reports said that a group of churchgoers seized Hendrik Letto,
after he received a consecrated host at the cathedral Nov. 26, UCA
News, an Asian church news agency based in Thailand, reported Dec.
29. According to reports, other parishioners then took him outside
and beat him to death in front of the cathedral. An unconfirmed
report from Letto's home village, about 70 miles south of Atambua,
said that Letto had been studying Catholicism because he wanted to
convert. In Kupang, capital of East Nusa Tenggara province,
government officials expressed concern over the killing.

CHURCH AIDING VICTIMS OF SOUTH AFRICAN FLOODS
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (CNS) -- A church in Pietermaritzburg
will coordinate the Catholic part of a joint relief effort for
victims of flash floods in Kwazulu-Natal, which left more than 120
people dead after heavy rains caused rivers to overflow on
Christmas Day. ``The damage is devastating,'' Archbishop Wilfrid
Napier of Durban said in a telephone interview with Catholic News
Service after visiting affected areas Dec. 27. ``Streams have been
turned into rivers and there are huge tree trunks lying across
roads,'' he said. The bishop said St. Mary's Church in central
Pietermaritzburg will coordinate the church's relief program. More
than 2,000 people have been left homeless by the floods.

ELECTRONIC VISITORS CROWD VATICAN INTERNET SITE
   VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- The Vatican's new Internet site was
swamped with online traffic over the Christmas holidays, leaving
church officials amazed and pleased. More than 300,000 people from
70 countries logged into the site on the World Wide Web in the 48
hours after its inauguration Dec. 25, Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro-Valls said. At its peak, the user rate was more than 20,000
people per hour. Nearly 1,000 of the electronic visitors left
messages. They ranged from theological observations to suggestions
for flu remedies for Pope John Paul II. The Vatican opened its
Internet ``home page'' by offering the pontiff's Christmas message
and greetings in more than 50 languages.

CATHOLIC JOURNALIST GETS FIRSTHAND LOOK AT HOMELESSNESS IN PHILLY
   PHILADELPHIA (CNS) -- A Catholic journalist who spent a week
living with the homeless of Philadelphia found that it's not always
easy to find a place to sleep or to figure out when to go where for
a meal. Lou Baldwin, a reporter for The Catholic Standard and Times
in Philadelphia, described his experiences in a lengthy article in
the archdiocesan newspaper in December. During the last week of
September, Baldwin packed a knapsack full of clothing, a few hard
rolls and a bottle of water, carried handwritten identification as
``Martin D. Palmer'' and put a few dollars in change into his
pocket to call his wife each day. He left home his eyeglasses and
credit cards, but wrapped $10 and a photocopy of his real
identification under the inner sole of his sneaker. Why did he do
it? ``Many times I have been called upon to write about the problem
of homelessness and what is being done to help the homeless,'' he
wrote. ``This was simply a way to get a true feel for the story
from the point of view of those who are affected most, not
administrators or social workers, but homeless people themselves.''

PREACH (from ST. LOUIS)
DOMINICANS MOVE SUMMER PREACHING INSTITUTE TO CHICAGO AREA

By Catholic News Service
   ST. LOUIS (CNS) -- The Aquinas Institute of Theology will move
its annual Aquinas Summer Preaching Institute from St. Louis to the
Chicago area in 1996.
   The new home of the two-week program, held in St. Louis since
1986, will be the Dominican Conference Center in River Forest, Ill.
   Dominican Sister Diane Kennedy, academic dean, said the new
location will make the institute's preaching resources available
to the Archdiocese of Chicago and surrounding dioceses.
   ``Cardinal (Joseph L.) Bernardin's strategic plan for the
archdiocese emphasizes the importance of good preaching and has
specific provisions for improving preaching,'' she noted. ``We are
eager to participate with the Chicago Office of Worship in that
effort.''
   The Dominicans began the summer institute as a way of sharing
their preaching charism with the church at large. Participants may
take the entire program or selected courses.
   The 1996 summer institute is scheduled for June 23-July 5.
Morning lectures will feature Dominican Sister Marygrace Peters on
``History and Preaching,'' and Dominican Sister Carla Mae Streeter
and Dominican Father Jude Siciliano on ``The Spirituality of the
Preacher.'' Afternoon sessions will focus on building homily skills
and evaluating student preaching.
   The Aquinas Institute is a Dominican graduate school of
theology and ministry for religious, laity and clergy. Its students
represent a variety of faith traditions.

POPE-YEAR (from VATICAN CITY)
POPE PRAYS FOR PEACE, JUSTICE -- ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN
By Cindy Wooden

With photos to come.
Catholic News Service
   VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Thanking God for the blessings of 1995
and marking the beginning of 1996, Pope John Paul II prayed for
peace and justice throughout the world, especially for children.
   Recovered from his Christmas bout with the flu, the pope led
the midday Angelus prayer Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 with visitors in St.
Peter's Square, led an evening prayer service of thanksgiving at
a Rome church New Year's Eve and celebrated Mass New Year's Day in
St. Peter's Basilica.
   Christians celebrate the New Year still focused on the birth
of Christ and the salvation he brings to all humanity, the pope
said during the Jan. 1 Mass.
   Marking the feast of Mary, Mother of God, and World Peace Day
at the Mass, the pope said the fact that God became human means
that human history has a divine order to it.
   ``Peace,'' he said, is a ``fundamental sign of divine
presence.''
   The pope said peace should be evident not only in individual
lives; ``it must also radiate throughout the political order and
in the life of communities and nations.''
   The name Jesus, which means ``God saves,'' holds the promise
of salvation from every evil, ``particularly from hatred, war and
destruction,'' the pope said.
   Pope John Paul chose as the theme of his 1996 World Peace Day
message, ``Let us give children a future of peace.''
   ``The children of the earth, at the end of this century, are
the seeds of the third millennium: For their tomorrow they ask for
works of peace and the inheritance of a united world marked by
solidarity,'' the pope said at the Angelus after Mass.
   ``The little ones embody the hopes, expectations and potential
of the human community,'' he said. ``They are witnesses and masters
of hope, a sentiment they live with a joyful enthusiasm.''
   ``Do not extinguish the hope in their hearts; do not suffocate
their expectations of peace!'' Pope John Paul said.
   ``It is truly important that we adults think of them and assure
children of a peaceful future,'' he said. ``It is our task and our
responsibility.''
   Reciting the Angelus the day before, the feast of the Holy
Family, the pope said that a natural part of parenthood is working
to avoid all that is bad for one's family and to guarantee every
possible good for one's children.
   But today's families, he said, which by their nature should be
centers of life and love, often are exposed to ``painful threats
of every kind.''
   Christian families are called to look to the Holy Family for
answers, he said. The relationship among Jesus, Mary and Joseph
was one of ``authentic love and charity, creating not only an
eloquent model for all families, but also offering a guarantee that
a similar love can be realized in every nuclear family.''
   Pope John Paul prayed that ``faith would grow in every house
and that in each home love, agreement, solidarity, mutual respect
and openness to life would reign.''
   The mayor of Rome and Italian political leaders joined the pope
Dec. 31 at Rome's St. Ignatius Church for an evening prayer service
of thanksgiving for the past year.
   The pope told the congregation that Italy, with a population
more than 95 percent Catholic, needs renewed evangelization ``so
that the cultural and social currents running toward a radical
secularization do not diminish the vigor of the faith held by the
majority of the population.''
   A state with clearly established laws, democracy and a
well-ordered economy ``cannot prosper without reference to that
which is owed man because he is man, that is to principles of truth
and objective moral criteria,'' the pope said.
   Moral relativism is an ``insidious enemy'' of democracy, not
its natural result, he said.
   ``One must work with courage so that social structures are
respectful of those ethical values that express the full truth
about humanity,'' the pope said.

WEEKLY ROUNDUP (from VATICAN CITY)
SPECULATION ON PAPAL HEALTH LASTS LONGER THAN POPE'S FLU
By John Thavis

With photos sent Dec. 27 and to come.
Catholic News Service
   VATICAN CITY (CNS) -- Pope John Paul II's Christmas bout with
the flu was over in about 24 hours, but it reverberated much longer
in the world's press, on the Internet and in the prayers of the
faithful.
   Sick with an upset stomach and a light fever, the 75-year-old
pope canceled his participation at Christmas morning Mass in St.
Peter's Basilica for the first time since his election in 1978.
   When he tried to pronounce the traditional blessing and message
for a worldwide TV audience later in the day, he was visibly shaken
by an attack of nausea and had to walk away from his apartment
window. He reappeared 20 minutes later to explain briefly that even
the pope gets sick.
   Vatican officials said the pope was feeling much better the
next day, and by the end of the week he was walking in the central
Italian mountains. But once again papal health had become an issue
in the world forum.
   During Pope John Paul's 17-year pontificate, his medical
travails have brought a new era of public disclosure at the
Vatican. From his assassination attempt in 1981 to his
hospitalization for falls and intestinal surgery in the early '90s,
the world has been able to follow his recoveries in daily medical
bulletins that have spared no details.
   That's a revolutionary concept for the Vatican, which for
centuries considered papal health a state secret. Popes were always
in good health until the day they died; if they needed an operation
-- like Pope Paul VI did for prostate problems -- they had it
inside the Vatican.
   But what if the pope's illness does not require
hospitalization? For the pope's flu, the press office statements
were reassuring but lacked the completeness of full medical
reports.
   Off-the-record, more detailed explanations were offered for the
pontiff's fever and nausea: He stayed up too late for midnight Mass
the night before, he caught a chill after sweating in St. Peter's
Basilica under heavy vestments, he was feeling the cumulative
effects of a very heavy schedule in 1995, or he caught a virus
going around Italy.
   Rome's Polish community was convinced it was something he ate,
though no one seemed to want to pronounce the words ``food
poisoning.''
   Whatever the precise cause, the pope could not have chosen a
more public place to feel sick, and the feedback was instant. The
press was alarmed; the faithful were sympathetic.
   He led the news around the world on Christmas, and the next
day's papers were full of dire headlines. Several quoted the pope
as saying, ``I cannot go on,'' a bit more dramatic than what he
actually said in Italian: ``Excuse me, I have to interrupt.''
Frame-by-frame photos of the pope feeling progressively lousier at
his apartment window were widely published.
   Meanwhile, the Vatican switchboard was jammed with callers
wondering about the state of the pontiff. But that was nothing
compared to the traffic at the Vatican's new Internet site.
   Inaugurated Christmas day, the Internet ``home page'' welcomed
online visitors with illustrated texts of the papal Christmas
message and greetings in more than 50 languages. It also offered
an e-mail box for messages, and several hundred people left them
-- many giving advice to the ailing pope.
   One U.S. girl named Sarah, for example, told him he should take
her father's remedy: Drink chicken broth and plenty of other
liquids. Get some rest and don't worry, she added. Others offered
prayers for the pope. The response delighted Vatican officials, who
said they were copying many of the messages for the pope's perusal.
   By Dec. 26, when the pope appeared for another blessing, the
alarm about his health had largely subsided at the Vatican. He left
the next day by helicopter for his summer villa outside Rome,
looking a bit wan but obviously feeling better.
   The global reaction, however, was still echoing. French Bishop
Jacques Gaillot, a controversial figure who had met with the pope
a few days before to discuss his ambiguous role in the church, said
that, in retrospect, he found the pontiff fatigued and looking
swollen in the face.
   Others wondered whether he would be up to another year of
global traveling: He had scheduled trips to Latin America in
February, and later to France, Germany, Hungary and Slovenia.
   As the questions lingered, the pope did not. According to
Vatican sources, he walked for three hours on central Italy's
tallest mountain Dec. 29. Witnesses quoted by Italian newspapers
said the papal entourage built a big fire and had grilled steaks,
cooked peaches and Barbera wine.
   Like all the pope's previous mountain excursions, this one was
considered ``private'' by the Vatican press office, which would not
officially confirm or deny the reports. But no one at the Vatican
was unhappy to see headlines the next day about the ``mountain
man'' pope back in form.

BISHOPS-RETIRE (from WASHINGTON)
TWELVE U.S. BISHOPS COULD RETIRE FOR AGE REASONS THIS YEAR
By Jerry Filteau

Catholic News Service
   WASHINGTON (CNS) -- There are 12 currently active U.S. bishops
who could retire for reasons of age in 1996.
   Six of them -- including two cardinals -- turned 75 last year
but Pope John Paul II has not yet accepted their resignations.
   Six other U.S. bishops will turn 75 within the next 12 months.
   The most prominent of the U.S. prelates who had their 75th
birthday last year are Cardinals John J. O'Connor of New York and
James A. Hickey of Washington. The pope has asked both to stay on
past the usual retirement age.
   Cardinal Hickey has been a priest since 1946, a bishop since
1967, archbishop of Washington since 1980 and a cardinal since
1988. He was born Oct. 11, 1920.
   Cardinal O'Connor has been a priest since 1945, a bishop since
1979, archbishop of New York since 1984 and a cardinal since 1985.
He was born Jan. 15, 1920.
   Two bishops who turned 75 last year are now the last remaining
active bishops in the United States to have participated as bishops
in the biggest church event of the 20th century, the Second Vatican
Council, which was held in four sessions from 1962 to 1965.
   They are:
   -- Cuban-born Maronite Archbishop Francis M. Zayek of the
Diocese of St. Maron in Brooklyn. A priest since 1946, he was made
a bishop in charge of Maronites in Brazil in 1962. In 1966 he
became the first exarch of U.S. Maronites, and when the exarchate
was made a diocese in 1971 he became its first bishop. In 1982 he
was given the personal title of archbishop. His 75th birthday was
Oct. 18.
   -- Auxiliary Bishop John J. Ward of Los Angeles, a priest since
1946 and a bishop since 1963. He turned 75 Sept. 28.
   Also 75 but still active at the start of the new year were:
   -- Bishop Edward T. Hughes, a priest since 1947, a bishop since
1976 and head of the Diocese of Metuchen, N.J., since 1986. He
turned 75 Nov. 13.
   -- Bishop Michael F. McAuliffe, a priest since 1945 and bishop
of Jefferson City, Mo., since 1969. He turned 75 Nov. 22.
   The bishops who will celebrate their 75th birthday in 1996 are:
   -- May 30: Bishop Norbert F. Gaughan, a priest since 1945,
bishop since 1975 and bishop of Gary, Ind., since 1984. Partially
incapacitated by a stroke in 1992, he has remained head of the
diocese but Bishop Dale J. Melczek has assisted him as apostolic
administrator since 1992 and coadjutor since last October.
   -- June 11: Bishop Leroy T. Matthiesen, a priest since 1946
and bishop of Amarillo, Texas, since 1980. In December he had
surgery to replace a heart valve.
   -- July 17: Auxiliary Bishop John B. McDowell of Pittsburgh,
a priest since 1945 and bishop since 1966.
   -- Aug. 1: Auxiliary Bishop Benedict C. Franzetta of
Youngstown, Ohio, a priest since 1950 and bishop since 1980.
   -- Aug. 14: Auxiliary Bishop James J. Daly of Rockville Centre,
N.Y., a priest since 1947 and bishop since 1977.
   -- Dec. 20: Bishop Thomas J. Welsh, a priest since 1946, bishop
since 1970 and bishop of Allentown, Pa., since 1983.
   Church law calls for bishops to submit their resignations to
the pope when they reach 75.
   Pope Paul VI, who first established the retirement rules,
generally accepted resignations promptly with the exception of
important bishops in troubled areas, such as under communist rule
in Eastern Europe.
   Pope John Paul has developed a more flexible approach. He
frequently delays retirement if the bishop has an important
anniversary coming up soon, such as the 50th anniversary of his
priesthood or the 25th or 30th since he became a bishop.
   Cardinals or archbishops who are particularly close to the pope
or who head one of the more important archdioceses in a country may
have their retirement delayed up to several years if they are in
good health.

DALY-BRITISH (from ARMAGH, Northern Ireland)
CARDINAL SAYS BRITISH INFLEXIBILITY IS MAIN OBSTACLE TO PEACE

By Catholic News Service
   ARMAGH, Northern Ireland (CNS) -- Political inflexibility on
the part of Britain is the main obstacle to a lasting peace in
Northern Ireland, said Cardinal Cahal Daly of Armagh.
   But the cardinal said he understood it was difficult for
British Prime Minister John Major to exercise flexibility at this
time because of his thin majority in British Parliament.
   However, it would be unfortunate if this problem led to the
suspicion that peace in Northern Ireland would be allowed to suffer
because of British political problems, he added.
   ``I do not believe that the prime minister would wish this to
happen,'' the cardinal said during a Jan. 1 Mass homily in Armagh's
St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   ``I am convinced of his personal commitment to establishing
peace in Northern Ireland,'' he said.
   ``I do earnestly hope that, in cooperation with the Irish
government and with the agreement of the political parties in
Northern Ireland, he will succeed in bringing this about,'' he
said.
   The cardinal spoke at a time when Major's Conservative Party
has a small majority in the House of Commons and its survival may
depend on support from the Northern Ireland Unionist Members of
Parliament who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United
Kingdom.
   Another obstacle to developing a peace plan is controversy over
the surrender of arms by the Irish Republican Army as well as
paramilitary groups favoring continued British rule.
   The British government wants the IRA to decommission its
weapons before its political wing, Sinn Fein, can participate in
peace talks. The IRA said the turning in of arms should be part of
the peace talks agenda and not a precondition for negotiations.
   Cardinal Daly favored including Sinn Fein in peace talks as a
way to achieve disarmament.
   He said that the principle of disarmament had to be accepted
by everyone and that the only realistic way to achieve this was for
the paramilitary organizations themselves to decide to disarm.
   ``In turn, the only people whose influence could persuade them
do so are the political leaders who support their political aims,''
he added.
   ``It is abundantly clear that these political leaders will
agree to do so only in the context of an overall political
settlement,'' he said.
   ``It is therefore clearly necessary that there should be
political talks in which these political leaders take part. If
there are other realistic and practical ways of bringing
decommissioning about, I am not aware that anyone has yet
identified them,'' he said.

CANADA-FUNERAL (from OTTAWA)
FUNERAL HELD FOR CANADIAN BISHOP KILLED IN AUTO CRASH
By Christopher Guly

Catholic News Service
   OTTAWA (CNS) -- Funeral services were held for Bishop Pierre
Fisette and two other religious from the northern Ontario Diocese
of Hearst who were killed in an auto accident.
   The three died Dec. 21 while traveling to Kapuskasing -- an
hour's drive south of Hearst. Along with Bishop Fisette, 52, the
other victims were Father Viateur Allary, 67, a member of the
Society for Foreign Missions, and Notre Dame Sister Micheline
Bolduc, 57.
   According to the police report, a pickup truck attempted to
pass them on the right, forcing Bishop Fisette's vehicle into the
oncoming lane where it was broadsided.
   The bishop and his passengers died instantly, according to the
report.
   Born in Steinbach, Manitoba, Feb. 2, 1943, Bishop Fisette
attended high school and university at Le College Universitaire de
Saint-Boniface in Winnipeg, where he graduated in 1963.
   After joining the Society for Foreign Missions, the future
bishop was ordained to the priesthood in 1968.
   Then-Father Fisette spent the next quarter-century working in
the southern Philippines as a missionary.
   He was consecrated bishop of Hearst in March 1994.
   Ottawa Archbishop Marcel Gervais was the main celebrant at the
funeral Mass held Dec. 27 in Hearst.

YOUTHS-METAL (from ST. PAUL, Minn.)
TEENS HAMMER AWAY IN METAL MINISTRY PROJECT

With photo to come.
By Catholic News Service
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (CNS) -- Metal-shop ministry is one of Father
Frank Wampach's side jobs.
   Under his tutelage, youths at the two Minnesota parishes where
Father Wampach is pastor -- St. Paul in Zumbrota and St. Mary in
Bellechester -- have been pounding away in the workshop he set up
at St. Mary. They are making brass crosses similar to the thousands
their parish priest has made and given away as gifts for
confirmations, baptisms and other special occasions.
   Father Wampach said he has larger goals in mind as he teaches
the foundry skills it takes to craft a marketable product.
   ``I can do an awful lot in the shop from a human point of
view,'' he told the Catholic Bulletin, newspaper of the Archdiocese
of St. Paul and Minneapolis. ``Working in the shop it's easy to
make a mistake. That's when young people can learn to forgive
themselves and move on.''
   Using a hammer and anvil, soldering iron and polishing wheel,
teen-agers learn that most things take a process to complete and
that teamwork makes the process easier, said Father Wampach. He
picked up blacksmith skills during a break from the seminary to
discern his vocation.
   The youths hope to sell more than 100 of the metal crosses, and
Father Wampach said it will be up to the teens to decide how to
spend the profits. He hopes they will see the need not only to fund
their own social events but also to designate a portion for the
needy.
   ``Having or making a product is one thing,'' he said. ``But
there is a lot more to be learned in this. We'll be talking about
the financial responsibility of stewardship -- what do you do with
the money when you make it.''
   The youths already have an order for crosses that will be used
as confirmation gifts by a parish in Kasson in the Diocese of
Winona, Minn.

TV REVIEWS ADD

   Add to TV REVIEWS of Dec. 29, 1995:
               ``The Winter's Tale,'' Jan. 14, HBO
   The Emmy Award-winning series, ``Shakespeare -- The Animated
Tales,'' returns for a second season beginning with ``The Winter's
Tale,'' premiering Sunday, Jan. 14, 7:30-8 p.m. EST on the HBO pay
cable channel.
   Not one of the Bard's more popular plays,``The Winter's Tale''
is a strange tragic fantasy with a happy ending as the gods of
whimsy intervene in the activities of mortals.
   The story begins with the king of Sicilia banishing his infant
daughter because he mistakenly believes his queen to be unfaithful,
whereupon the poor woman dies of grief.
   His lost daughter is found and raised by shepherds who are as
unaware of her royal origins as she herself is.
   Some 16 years pass when, smitten with her beauty, the prince
of Bohemia seeks to marry her despite his father, whose wrath
causes them to flee.
   They wind up in Sicilia where the daughter is welcomed by her
grief-stricken father, all the principals are reconciled and the
shepherds rewarded for their kindness, a truly feel-good ending.
   As with the others in the series, the adaptation is by Leon
Garfield, the animation is the work of Russian craftsmen and the
voices are supplied by British actors.
   The half-hour format gives the gist of the action and the
British delivery of the Elizabethan dialogue captures the spirit
of the characters.
   But it is the imaginative animation which makes these digests
worth seeing. Using stop-motion puppets and evocative art design,
``The Winter's Tale'' establishes a fantasy world playfully
diverting in itself but entirely in keeping with Shakespeare's
intent.
   This is what children will find most enjoyable, once past the
dark, threatening beginning.
   So too will adults, though it also serves as an introduction
to one of Shakespeare's plays that most will never have an
opportunity to read or see produced on the stage. (HH)
           ``Pharaohs and Kings: A Biblical Quest,''
                 Jan. 14, Learning Channel cable
   Egyptologist David Rohl shows viewers where his archeological
investigations of Old Testament history have led in ``Pharaohs and
Kings: A Biblical Quest,'' premiering Sunday, Jan. 14, 8-11 p.m.
EST on cable's Learning Channel.
   Traditional archeology has never found any concrete evidence
of Moses leading the Hebrew people from the land of Egypt. Yet
British archeologist Rohl claims to have found artifacts verifying
not only Exodus but other events in biblical history.
   His claims, however, are based on his controversial redating
of the accepted chronology of the pharaohs' dynasties because they
did not properly jibe with his reading of the archeological
evidence.
   In an effort to corroborate his revised chronology, Rohl tried
to match his new dates with biblical events and found that he was
able to do so, at least to his satisfaction.
   While the documentary shows Rohl's enthusiasm over his
discoveries, it also listens as his more sober peers discount them
as interesting speculation but far from proven.
   Viewers are not called upon to make any judgment about the
relative merits of Rohl's revision of Egyptian chronology or the
controversy they have sparked in relation to biblical archeology.
   Whether Rohl is on the right track or not, the documentary
provides an archeological tour of Egypt and the Holy Land in the
company of a seasoned observer who brings the evidence of the past
to life.
   Rohl's speculation about Egyptian clay tablets relating to
Kings Saul and David, the fall of Jericho and the Jerusalem
residence of Solomon's Egyptian queen are fascinating examples of
archeological detective work.
   Most spectacular is his conjecture that the Egyptian remains
of a massive statue whose face had been almost totally mutilated
is actually that of a monument to the patriarch Joseph who had led
the Israelites to Egypt.
   Though the evidence here seems pretty thin, it is in keeping
with one's expectations of Joseph's place in the Egypt of his day.
   While Rohl's unorthodox interpretations of the ancient history
of the Near East may never gain acceptance from his peers, this
documentary about his work is a stimulating introduction to the
challenges and wonders of biblical archeology. (HH)

VICTIMS (from ELIZABETH, N.J.)
NEW JERSEY PARISH HOLDS FUNERAL FOR COLOMBIAN PLANE CRASH VICTIMS
By Michael Wojcik

Catholic News Service
   ELIZABETH, N.J. (CNS) -- A Colombian folk song, ``Los
Guaduales,'' says: ``They cry, they cry because they also have a
soul. I have seen them crying in the valleys when an afternoon wind
separates them. I have also seen them happy when intertwined.''
   The song speaks of the branches of a willowlike South American
bamboo, but Father Sean Cunneen played it during his homily at the
funeral Mass Dec. 29 for Patricia Jimenez, 37, and her daughters,
Erika and Vanesa, victims of the American Airlines plane crash Dec.
20 near Cali, Colombia.
   The mountainside crash took the lives of 160 of the 164 people
aboard the Miami-to-Cali flight.
   ``We're like the tree. We cry when we're separated,'' said
Father Cunneen, pastor of Blessed Sacrament Parish in Elizabeth,
where the Jimenezes have been parishioners since they moved to New
Jersey 15 years ago.
   Patricia Jimenez's husband, Fernando, was supposed to have been
on the same plane with his wife and daughters, on their way to
spend Christmas with relatives in Colombia, but he was delayed and
had planned to join them a few days later.
   Instead he found himself surrounded by more than 700 fellow
mourners at the funeral and burial of his wife and daughters.
   For the family's sake, reporters were asked not to attend, but
Father Cunneen later talked about it with The Catholic Advocate,
Newark archdiocesan newspaper, and Catholic News Service.
   He said Erika, 18, who was born in Cali, was a member of the
Elizabeth High School band.
   Vanesa, 8, was born in Elizabeth. Father Cunneen said she was
in the middle of preparations to receive first Communion.
   He said he had been deeply moved by ``Los Guaduales'' when he
first heard the song during a several-week stay in Cali almost 20
years ago.
   He played a recording of it during his homily, he said, because
it has a deeply Christian message. Like the tree's branches,
``people are filled with sorrow when we must be apart but pleased
when we are together again,'' he said.
   The words also remind us that we are happy when we are near
God and remind us that a Christian death is the fulfillment of our
destiny to be reunited with the Lord, he said.
   ``We don't know why these things happen,'' he said of the
airline crash. ``But we do know that God is with us.''
   That is the message of the Christmas season, he added:
``Emmanuel -- God is with us.''

FARMER (from JONESVILLE, Mich.)
FARMER HOPES TO PROMOTE CATHOLIC RURAL LIFE MOVEMENT IN MICHIGAN
By Robert Delaney

Catholic News Service
   JONESVILLE, Mich. (CNS) -- Dolores DeBacker thinks both farmers
and city dwellers should learn more about the issues affecting
agriculture and how Catholic social teaching applies to them.
   ``I'm not saying I'm going to change the world, but I hope to
bring an awareness of food issues,'' said Mrs. DeBacker, who lives
on an 800-acre farm just north of Jonesville in south-central
Michigan.
   A member of St. Anthony of Padua Parish in the Diocese of
Lansing, she is working with the Michigan Catholic Conference and
representatives from several Michigan dioceses to help build the
Catholic rural life movement in the state.
   Its goals include promoting an appreciation of farming as a
vocation and a sense of community among farmers, as well as greater
understanding of how national and state policies impact family
farms, farm workers, and the cost and availability of food.
   Mrs. DeBacker said there is cause for concern about a number
of trends affecting farmers, such as the dwindling number of family
farms, the growth of corporate farming and increasing dominance of
large ``agribusiness'' corporations, the disappearance of locally
owned and managed banks, and the sustainability of many modern
farming practices. All of these could not only mean tougher times
ahead for small farmers, but also could adversely affect the food
available to consumers, she said.
   Some of these factors stem largely from governmental policies
that have favored large-scale corporate operators over family
farmers. Others have more to do with lifestyle and buying habits
of both farmers and consumers that have wrought huge changes in
food production and sales patterns over the past several decades,
Mrs. DeBacker said.
   Shifting government policies that have promoted larger-scale
and more intensive farming have left many farmers with huge debts
and raised the threshold of capital needed for a young farmer to
get started, according to Mrs. DeBacker. ``Everything has gotten
bigger and more impersonal, and there are fewer and fewer of us
now,'' she said.
   The trend toward concentration has been especially marked when
it comes to the companies that purchase crops from farmers, she
said. Whereas there used to be many markets for a farmer's produce,
now there are five major grain dealers that operate worldwide, she
said. ``These companies are controlling everything from the seed
to what sits on the shelf.''
   Farmers themselves need to have a greater appreciation of their
role as stewards of the land, a sense of farming as a worthy
vocation -- ``of creating something out of God's gifts'' -- and a
greater understanding of the importance of a sense of community.
``I think we need to lead a different lifestyle -- not just like
the Amish, but they are a witness,'' she said.
   Consumers also need to gain a greater understanding of food
issues, and perhaps consider how they have played into the hands
of large agribusiness conglomerates by their growing appetite for
processed and prepared foods instead of cooking meals from scratch,
Mrs. DeBacker said. ``People don't know how to cook, they don't
know how to shop. These companies promote the idea that, if you buy
all these things, your life is going to be easier, but it isn't
easier,'' she said.
   Mrs. DeBacker added, however, that she understands that food
issues are pretty foreign to most city dwellers, because they once
were for her, too.
   Mrs. DeBacker and her husband, Frank, both grew up in Detroit.
When they first decided to go into farming in 1962, they started
with a 175-acre farm in Armada. They moved to their present farm
in 1972, and eventually expanded it to 800 acres. They milk 180
cows and grow corn and wheat.
   Mrs. DeBacker said she is glad the Catholic Church is promoting
the Catholic rural life movement. ``I think it's the church's place
to call us to re-examine our lives,'' she said. ``I don't see how
we can just keep consuming, and not care about each other.''

PIERONEK (from WARSAW, Poland)
CHURCH OFFICIALS BOYCOTT POLISH PRESIDENT'S INAUGURATION
By Jonathan Luxmoore

Catholic News Service
   WARSAW, Poland (CNS) -- A top official of the Polish bishops'
conference cited legal and political considerations for the
decision by church leaders to boycott the inauguration of the
country's new president, a former communist.
   Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, conference secretary-general, said he
and Polish primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp declined invitations to
the Dec. 23 ceremony for President Aleksander Kwasniewski because
of:
   -- A Supreme Court ruling that Kwasniewski had violated
campaign laws.
   -- Outgoing President Lech Walesa's decision to boycott the
inaugural.
   -- Allegations made by a Walesa supporter that Kwasniewski ally
Premier Jozef Olesky had been a KGB agent.
   ``The climate generated by the behavior of the president-elect,
who did not react to the Supreme Court's statement that he had
violated the law, as well as the demonstrative activity of
President Walesa, and the issues connected with premier Olesky --
 these factors made us decide against attending the inauguration,''
Bishop Pieronek said in a Dec. 28 interview with Catholic News
Service.
   The inauguration was attended by leaders of minority churches,
including the Orthodox Church, as well as by Vatican nuncio
Archbishop Jozef Kowalczyk.
   Pope John Paul II sent Kwasniewski best wishes for a ``fruitful
service to the Polish nation's welfare.''
   In a telegram to Walesa, the pope praised the Solidarity
movement that the ex-president had founded and said it had
established a ``Polish path'' that other nations had adopted in
``peacefully rejecting the injustices of the Marxist system.''
   Observers of the Polish political scene predicted a sharp
deterioration in church-state relations in the wake of a bitter
election campaign in which most church leaders publicly opposed
Kwasniewski.
   In a pre-Christmas decision, Poland's Supreme Court ruled that
Kwasniewski had given out false biographical information during the
campaign. But the court declined to order a new election.
   ``The issue should be clarified very quickly, without any side-
taking,'' Bishop Pieronek told KAI, Poland's Catholic Information
Agency.
   He also blamed Polish democracy for allowing the former
communists ``to grab part of the national property and become a new
class of capitalists, while at the same time permitting a party
with its origins in the Polish United Workers Party (the communist
party during Marxist rule) to legitimize itself in different
forms.''
   In his inaugural address, Kwasniewski said he is ``counting on
dialogue with opposition forces.''
   He said that as a member of the Polish political left, he
stands for ``justice, national liberties, and human rights.''
   ``I am certain that the greatest contribution to agreement
should be made by the relationship of the state and its structures
with the churches, especially the Polish Roman Catholic Church,''
he said.
   He said consideration should be given to how church-state
relations should look in a ``modern democratic state of law.''
   He said he would respect all church members who think in terms
of the ``supreme interests of our common state.''
   ``But I would also like there to be no doubts that nothing will
be achieved on the path of confrontation and heated emotions,''
he said.
   Several Polish newspapers noted that Kwasniewski, a self-
declared agnostic, had omitted the traditional words ``So help me
God'' at the end of his presidential oath.
   Among his first appointments, the new president named leading
supporters Danuta Waniek and Marek Ungier, both longtime
communists, to senior presidential staff posts.
   In his traditional televised Christmas Eve broadcast, Cardinal
Glemp said he shares ``the doubts awakened in many hearts'' by
recent events, adding that ``political elements'' are causing fear
and insecurity among Polish Catholics.
   ``The policies of the church and of people of good will are to
help each other, and not allow the evil which surrounds us to
develop,'' he said.
   The formerly communist daily Trybuna said in a front-page
commentary that ``the president and the church hierarchy can and
should act in an above-party manner, creating the space for talks
between various circles, organizing meetings between those who
stand far from each other, controlling political and social
emotions, and giving a good example of culture in public life.''

INDONESIA-SOEKOTO (from JAKARTA, Indonesia)
INDONESIAN ARCHBISHOP DIES OF SPINAL CANCER

By Catholic News Service
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNS) -- Retired Archbishop Leo Soekoto of
Jakarta died Dec. 30 of spinal cancer at St. Elizabeth Catholic
Hospital in Semarang. He was 75.
   The body of the late archbishop, whose resignation as head of
Jakarta Archdiocese took effect Nov. 10, was taken to Semarang's
Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Cathedral, where it remained for
viewing Dec. 31.
   Several government officials were among those who paid their
respects, reported UCA News, an Asian church news agency based in
Thailand.
   Thousands of Catholic mourners attended the Jesuit archbishop's
Jan. 1 funeral Mass, at which Cardinal Julius Darmaatmadja of
Semarang presided.
   Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Vatican pronuncio, was among the seven
bishops and 60 priests concelebrating the Mass.
   In his homily, Cardinal Darmaatmadja said the Indonesian
Catholic Church has lost a great leader and thinker who was able
to assess situations clearly.
   The cardinal praised the late archbishop's determined
leadership, strong commitment to principles and courage to express
views ``against the current.''
   After the Mass, Archbishop Soekoto's coffin was taken to
Girisonta, southwest of Semarang, to be buried at the Jesuit
cemetery close to the tomb of his eldest brother, the late Jesuit
Father Antonius Soenarjo, a former superior of the Jesuit Indonesia
province.
   Archbishop Soekoto was born in Jali, a village in Yogyakarta
province. Ordained a Jesuit priest in 1953, he was ordained
archbishop of Jakarta in 1970.
   In a farewell letter to Jakarta Catholics when he retired, the
archbishop asked forgiveness for ``the sins and mistakes I
committed in the past 25 years.''
   His most notable and well-known sin, he said, was being ``a
hot-headed man.''

KOREA-CHARGE (from SEOUL, South Korea)
PRIEST RECEIVES NOTICE OF CHARGE ON CHRISTMAS DAY

By Catholic News Service
   SEOUL, South Korea (CNS) -- A Korean priest who had allegedly
violated parole was given notice on Christmas Day that he was the
first person charged under the 1989 Security Watch Law.
   Father Paul Mun Kyu-hyon, a representative of the Priests'
Association for Justice and a priest of Yochon parish in Chonju
Diocese, was notified by the Chonbuk provincial prosecutor that he
had been indicted for the violation, UCA News, an Asian church news
agency based in Thailand, reported.
   In 1989, Father Mun was sentenced to five years' imprisonment
after he violated South Korea's National Security Law by traveling
to Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, without official permission.
   He was paroled Dec. 24, 1992, as a part of a Christmas amnesty.
   According to the Chonbuk prosecutor, the Security Watch Law
obliged Father Mun to inform the head of the local police station
where he lived of his release within seven days of leaving prison.
   Because Father Mun failed to meet that obligation, the
prosecutor said, he was indicted.
   Father Mun told UCA News Dec. 27 that he had intentionally
violated the law.
   ``I ignored summons letters of the police station 10 times,
because (the Security Watch Law) is an evil law not worth
obeying,'' he said.
   Authorities must have hurried to indict him, he added,
``because they did not even write the exact date of indictment.''
   ``I will fight to abolish the law with any sacrifice. But (the
authorities) might feel constrained to punish me,'' Father Mun
said.
