<h3>Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium (SETC)</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Battery and Battery Management System Test Project<p>
Performing Organization: Sacramento Municipal Utility District</B><p>


<P>Technical POC: Mike Wirsch (916) 732­6754 </P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P><P>The Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium is creating a
world class battery test facility at McClellan AFB in Sacramento. This facility will be used
to test electric and hybrid electric vehicle battery packs, and to evaluate the ability of battery management systems (BMS)
to preserve capacity and life of advanced batteries. Testing will be performed using
state­of­the­art AeroVironment ABC­150 Power Systems designed for advanced battery
testing and accurate simulation of hybrid electric vehicle drive cycles ­­ especially
applicable to the PNGV effort. 
</P>
<P><B>Project Goals:</B> </P>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Evaluate the ability of state of the art battery management systems (designed to monitor individual battery modules) to prevent overcharging batteries in an EV     application. </P>
<P><LI> Validate accuracy of temperature compensated state­of­charge gauge (designed to provide the driver with information that will prevent battery overdischarge). 
</P>
<P><LI> Validate effectiveness of equalization charging method provided by many battery management systems to maximize capacity on each discharge. 
</P>
<P><LI> Evaluate the overall benefits of battery management systems and provide feedback to manufacturer's to assist in the creation of "smart" battery systems. 
</P>
</UL>

<B><B>Project Deliverables: </B></B>

<P>Establish Battery Test Facility </P>
<P>AeroVironment ABC­150 Advanced Battery Cycler Test Systems will be used:</P> 
<ul>
<P><LI> designed specifically for testing electric and hybrid­electric vehicle battery packs</P>

<P><LI> 125 kW available for cycling two battery packs simultaneously on independently programmed cycling programs provides high power quality to the batteries and feeds power back to the grid  the only battery cycler capable of duplicating hybrid EV cycles</P>
</ul>


<P>Establish Test Procedures </P>

<P>AeroVironment is assisting in development of appropriate test strategies suited for electric and hybrid electric vehicles.</P>

<P>Evaluate Battery Management Systems.</P>  <p>At least six battery management systems will be evaluated for user­friendliness, accuracy and adaptability: </P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     Firing Circuits Batlog Micro 
<LI>     AeroVironment SmartGuard(D 
<LI>     Electrosource Maximizer 
<LI>     AC Propulsion Charge Management System 
<LI>     Drake Associates Badicheq 
<LI>     H­Power Battery Sentinel </UL></P>

<P><B>Pack Testing And Field Testing </B></P>

<P>At least four battery management systems will receive side­by­side testing. Two identical packs will be wired in series, one equipped with a battery management system and one without (the control pack). Simultaneous cycling of both packs will be performed by the ABC­150 while monitoring the packs via data acquisition systems.  The same systems tested on the bench will be installed in working electric vehicles for field testing.  Data analysis will be performed using battery pack throughput records and periodic capacity measurements. </P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>

<P>This two year effort will allow life cycle testing of four sets of battery packs equipped with four different battery management systems for up to 600 cycles each. Simultaneous testing of the same systems in vehicles will allow an evaluation of the systems by users and will prove the system's roadworthiness.</P>
