<p><em><strong>Title</strong></em><strong>. </strong>Mechatronics Design - Concept and Tools</p>
<p><em><strong>Abstract</strong></em><strong>. </strong> Mechatronics has developed worldwide into a very attractive research area. It combines in a synergetic way the classical engineering disciplines of mechanical and electrical engineering and computer science, leading to new kinds of products.  Mechatronics is a relatively new area of science and technology.  We are working intensively in this field.  The lecture includes explanation what we understand by the mechatronics, what kind of tools are used for mechatronic design.  Two mechatronic project results will be reported. </p>
<p> The other topic which is intensively studied in our department is education in mechatronics.  Some goals and requirements for education in mechatronics will be shown and discussed.</p>
