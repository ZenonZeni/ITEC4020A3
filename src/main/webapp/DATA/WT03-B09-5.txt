AHCPR Releases
Cataract Guidelines

Although it stops short of charging surgical overuse, a federally sponsored
clinical guideline for cataract management urges the use of glasses and
other visual aids before rushing a patient into surgery. In 1991, 1.35
million procedures were performed.

The presence of a cataract, a naturally occurring cloudiness of the eye,
"never solely justifies" surgery, says Dennis O'Day, MD, chairman of the
18-member panel commissioned by the Agency for Health Care Policy &
Research (AHCPR) to develop the guidelines. In most cases, surgery should
be performed only if patients feel their lifestyle is compromised or if
visual impairment isn't corrected by glasses or other interventions, says
the guideline. Claiming that tests currently used by ophthalmologists to
gauge if surgery is necessary don't work, O'Day argues, "ultimately, the
decision is made by the patient."

Ophthalmologists who perform cataract surgeries have an "ethical
obligation" to provide postoperative care, says the guideline. Although
some postop care can be delegated to other professionals, including nurses
and optometrists, the guideline recommends that the primary responsibility
for postop rehabilitation fall to the primary ophthalmologist.

The guideline enjoys wide support from ophthalmology groups, but the
American Optometric Assn. charges the document "largely ignores the
extensive and legitimate role of optometrists." AOA disputes that
ophthalmologists should be the only provider of postoperative care for
patients who have "clearly recovered" from surgery.

Carotid Endarterectomy Still Questionable

The latest study on surgery to prevent stroke deaths does little to clear
up controversy over the treatment. Whether carotid endarterectomy reduces
mortality remains uncertain despite the procedure's widespread use, say
researchers, blaming sample size for their lack of conclusions.

The prospective Veterans' Affairs study, reported in the Jan. 28 New
England Journal of Medicine, followed 444 men with asymptomatic carotid
stenosis at 11 VA medical centers nationwide between 1983 and 1991.
Carotid stenosis is a hardening of one of the two main arteries in the
neck. Endarterectomy is the surgical removal of atherosclerotic plaque from
the artery. In 1990, 68,000 endarterectomies were performed in the U.S.,
down from a peak of 107,000 in 1985.

The researchers set out to find endarterectomy's effect on stroke and on
transient monocular blindness and transient ischemic attacks, both warning
symptoms of carotid stenosis. The patients were randomly assigned to groups
treated either surgically or medically. Both groups were treated with
aspirin. In the surgical group, 4.7 percent suffered strokes, compared with
9.4 percent in the medical group, but the combined incidence of stroke and
death "showed no benefit from operative intervention."

Outcomes Leader
Is Key Clinton Adviser

Thomas Pyle, acting chairman of the new Health Outcomes Institute, has a
key role advising the Clinton Administration on health care system
infrastructure and support, including quality assurance.

Formerly CEO of the Harvard Community Health Plan, Pyle is listed as chair
of a White House working group on health reform in an undated internal
document obtained last week by F&G's Automated Medical Payments News.
According to the memo, the working group addressing "New System
Infrastructure and Support" is divided into two subgroups: one addressing
Quality Assurance and the other, Administration, Reimbursement and
Information Systems. Pyle is listed as chairing both.

Meanwhile, the formal announcement that Pyle is acting chair of the Health
Outcomes Institute -- the successor to InterStudy -- was made Feb. 8. The
Institute's board includes Pyle, William Goss of General Electric, Kermit
Knudsen, MD, of Scott & White Clinic, and Donald Steinwachs of Johns
Hopkins University (MOGA 1/11/93).

The Minnesota-based Institute promotes the "Outcomes Management System"
(OMS), originally developed under the leadership of Paul Ellwood, MD, when
he was at InterStudy. OMS relies on the generic SF-36 patient quality-of-
life instrument and condition-specific TyPE questionnaires, filled out by
treating physicians. Information is gathered before, during, and after
clinical interventions and surgeries. Proponents want this approach
incorporated into the "managed competition" reform proposal now being
developed by the Clinton Administration. They propose that the Institute
become the central repository for OMS information and disseminate it to
payers and consumers, as a quality check on large health plan providers
(MOGA 1/28, 2/11).

Other names included in the memo as members of a Quality Assurance sub-
group include former HCFA researcher Henry Krakauer, MD, HCFA Health
Standards & Quality Bureau Director Barbara Gagel, Institute of Medicine
researcher Kathleen Lohr, and AHCPR senior staffer Linda Demlo. One insider
said the group hasn't yet grappled with specific approaches like OMS. At
press time, Pyle was unavailable for comment.

Medicare Quality Studies
Shouldn't Get Too Elaborate -- HCFA

The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is telling Medicare PROs
not to get carried away with elaborate and costly quality-of-care studies.
That's the message of a Feb. 3 draft memo to PROs from HCFA Senior
Physician Adviser Stephen Jencks, M D, regarding implementation of HCFA's
"Health Care Quality Improvement Initiative," which is to be phased in to
PRO workplans beginning Apr. 1.

In collaborating on practice pattern analysis with local physicians and
hospitals, PROs should "avoid research and writing guidelines," says
Jencks. He calls that the responsibility of AHCPR, arguing that PROs should
choose manageable, time-limited projects that emphasize "direct human
contact" between PROs and local providers.

Jencks recommends that PROs look at, among other things, differential
diagnosis in stroke, underuse of breast and cervical cancer screening, and
DRG coding errors. PROs should focus on areas showing "substantial
variation" between local practice and existing guidelines promulgated by
medical specialty societies, says the memo.

Jencks' recommendation that PROs use existing specialty society guidelines
to study variation is likely to raise eyebrows in the research community.
Duke University Professor David Eddy, MD, RAND researcher Robert Brook, MD,
the U.S. General Accounting Office, and others all argue that these
guidelines often haven't been validated by outcomes research and vary
substantially in terms of the rigor with which they're developed. Brook has
been especially critical of guidelines developed in the absence of
substantial literature reviews.

Lee To Head Public Health Service

HHS Secretary Donna Shalala has selected Philip Lee, MD, as Asst. Secretary
for Health. The job involves managing the $21 billion Public Health
Service, which oversees the Agency for Health Care Policy & Research
(AHCPR).

Lee, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University
of California at San Francisco, currently heads the Physician Payment
Review Commission. The PPRC's 1992 Annual Report to Congress included a
section critical of AHCPR. The re port accused the agency of failing to
develop guidelines addressing the most costly and overused treatments and
procedures.

"The efforts of guideline developers are not guided by a consistent set of
priorities," said PPRC. The report called for closer scrutiny of how panels
deliberate, more disclosure of the underpinnings of panel findings, more
efficient literature searches, and attention to questionable procedures
like chest x-rays, colonoscopy, and appendectomy.

AHCPR Administrator J. Jarrett Clinton, MD, tells MOGA that despite budget
constraints, AHCPR is reordering its priorities to focus more on cost
issues than it did initially. He cites guidelines now in process addressing
smoking cessation and mammography. Clinton says he has made no secret of
his wish to stay in his current position, that he has heard nothing from
the new Administration, and that his relations with Lee are "excellent."

MN Blues Form Managed Care Network
For Elective Cardiac Procedures

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota (BCBSM) and its Blue Plus HMO have
formed a network of what they consider the state's 10 best cardiac care
providers in an effort to manage elective cardiac care procedures. The
Minnesota Blues say of their Project Health Vision Cardiac Network that for
"the first time in Minnesota, patient outcomes and other quality of care
measures have been used to select providers."

BCBSM used the MedisGroups data analysis and severity indexing system to
compare complication and mortality rates for a variety of cardiac
procedures among hospitals throughout the state. The providers chosen by
the combination insurer/HMO-style provider for its network average 15
deaths per 1,000 for cardiac procedures, compared with a statewide average
of 35 deaths per 1,000. BCBSM formed the network to provide cardiac
catheterization, electrophysiologic diagnostics, angioplasty, coronary
artery bypass grafts (CABG), and valve surgery -- all on an elective,
nonemergency basis.

"Our research showed wide variation in patient outcomes among cardiac care
providers" in the state, says Mark Banks, MD, senior VP of BCBSM and COO of
Blue Plus. In addition to the MedisGroups data, BCBSM chose the providers
according to their experience with the procedures and their "potential to
participate in a long term relationship with Blue Plus."

Blue Plus and BCBSM plan to use similar selection techniques over the next
few years to create networks for oncology, orthopedics, high-risk
maternity, neurology, and physical therapy.

All three of Minneapolis-St.Paul's major hospital systems are included in
the network, says Vic Ellison, VP of the Metropolitan Healthcare Council,
the Twin Cities' hospital association. A spokeperson from the statewide
Minnesota Hospital Assn. said "all of the major players" in the state are
involved in the network.

AHCPR Insures Guideline Developers,
Offers Legal Guidance to Panels

The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) has purchased
liability insurance to protect members of agency-sponsored guidelines
panels, should the guidelines they produce not hold up in court. To date,
AHCPR has spent approximately $150,000 for a policy that would cover
individuals or entire teams, including consultants, for up to $5 million,
says an agency spokesperson.

An AHCPR report on "The Use of Language in Clinical Practice Guidelines" is
expected to be released to the public in the next few months. A draft has
already been distributed to the federal guidelines panels and is now
winding its way through an elaborate clearance and revision process.

The report, like the four guideline sets the agency has released so far,
will include a "quick reference guide" and a longer monograph. These offer
"guidelines on developing guidelines" for teams concerned with the "legal
implications" of the language they are using. Written by George Washington
University's Center for Health Policy Research, it has sections devoted to
the legal significance of words, hazards inherent to guidelines drafting,
the importance of documenting all decisions that led to finalizing
guidelines, and actual legal cases that examined practice guidelines. The
report should become available "no later than June," says Kathleen
Hastings, director of the agency's Legal Medicine Program.

The Agency commissioned the report to calm fears expressed by AHCPR's own
guidelines panels, but the report should be useful for specialty societies
and others developing practice guidelines, says Hastings.
For more on legal issues in guideline development, see p. 7.

Maine Liability Project
May Include More Specialties

If legislation proposed in Maine late last month is signed into law, it
will expand the state's ground-breaking Medical Liability Demonstration
Project to allow inclusion of all medical specialties. Only four are
currently participating: anesthesiology, emergency medicine,
obstetrics/gynecology, and radiology.

At press time, the proposal was being reviewed by the state's banking and
insurance committee and awaiting a public hearing.

Under the current law, the first of its type in the country, physicians may
use proof of adherence to state panel-produced practice guidelines as an
"affirmative defense" in malpractice cases. The 1990 law called for a five-
year demonstration period beginning in January 1992, during which
defendants who signed on as participants can introduce evidence that they
followed one or more of the 20 protocols for the four specialties. The law
stipulated that the project would not begin unless more than half of the
state's practitioners in each of those specialties agreed to participate.
Among the specialties, enlistment has ranged "from 58 percent to almost 90
percent in ob/gyn," says Gordon Smith, counsel for the Maine Medical Assn.
Under the new proposal, any additional specialties that wished to
participate would also have to sign up over half of their members.

The law intends to lower medical costs in the state by stemming the tide of
defensive medicine. Similar laws have since been enacted in Minnesota,
Vermont, and Florida (see box on p. 8).

There have been no test cases so far under the five-year project, and the
likelihood that any will come soon is slim, says Smith. "These 20 protocols
deal with a very small portion of the medicine practiced in a small state
by a small number of physicians. We're glad to see (the other three states)
joining in because it's going to take a lot more data than we have to
examine the liability issue."

While liability seems to be the main focus of the Maine project, it's
important not to lose sight of the program's effect on patients, says
Robert Keller, MD, executive director of the Maine Medical Assessment
Foundation. He calls for a study documenting changes in patient outcomes
resulting from practitioners following the parameters.

CA Firms Start High-Tech Angioplasty Tests

Two California medical device manufacturers are launching separate clinical
trials focusing on percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
outcomes. One study is designed to determine if patients with lesions
determined "significant" by angiography might benefit from drug therapy
over PTCA. The other study is designed to evaluate PTCA success when the
invasive nonsurgical procedure is performed by a combination
ultrasound/angioplasty device.

Mountain View-based Cardiometrics will test its ultrasound catheter, called
FloWire, in 14 hospitals across the country "to conclude that patients
whose coronary lesions don't impair blood flow are appropriately excluded
from angioplasty."

The prospective, controlled trial will randomize 425 patients with
"angiographically significant" lesions that do not impair blood flow to
groups receiving either angioplasty or drug therapy. "Our belief is that
angioplasty done on lesions that don't impair blood flow will not lead to
greater angina relief than medical therapy alone," says Nat Bowditch,
Cardiometrics marketing manager. The two groups will be assessed at 30
days, six months, and one year to determine whether symptoms are relieved
and patients' ability to perform a standardized exercise stress test.
Adverse event rates including coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG),
myocardial infarctions, and mortality will be compared. It is estimated
that 375,000 PTCAs were performed in the U.S last year at a cost of about
$10,000-$15,000 each.

Pleasanton-based EndoSonics is starting a randomized, multicenter clinical
trial of a projected 500 patients to test its combination ultrasound
catheter and balloon angioplasty device, called Oracle-Micro. EndoSonics
will test the effectiveness of PTCAs performed with the Oracle-Micro
against those performed with traditional PTCA devices, which do not offer
simultaneous ultrasound imaging. A six-month follow-up will compare
complication rates for the two groups. Complications from PTCA include
thrombosis, artery dissection, and acute reclosure, says EndoSonics
President Mike Henson.

Specialty Society Ready To Release
Parkinson's Disease Guidelines

The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is set to release its guidelines
for initial treatment of Parkinson's disease. A draft of the guidelines,
which were approved by the AAN's executive board this week, calls for using
levodopa as a front-line therapy because it is "usually the most effective"
of all the drugs indicated for alleviating symptoms. The draft lists the
advantages and drawbacks of the other drugs in relation to levodopa.

The AAN says it developed the guidelines because of current variations and
controversy surrounding initial treatment. The group describes initial
therapy as the first two years of treatment following diagnosis. The
recommendations are based on a literature search of 818 articles and
textbooks and were approved by consensus of AAN experts.

The guidelines caution that treatment must be tailored to each patient and
that prolonged follow-up is necessary to recognize and adjust for
medication side effects. Doctors are told to encourage physical activity
and watch for signs of depression. In addition to treatment
recommendations, the guidelines contain recommendations for future
research, including outcomes studies to assess the benefits of physical
therapy.

MN Managed Care Firm Tests
Substance Abuse Outcomes Measures

A managed mental health care firm is launching a nationwide pilot study to
test a system for measuring substance abuse treatment outcomes. Ultimately
the system will be used to create what developers call "empirically based
standards of care" for providers.

Minneapolis-based MCC Behavioral Care, a subsidiary of Cigna, commissioned
a team of researchers at the University of Minnesota to construct a
database for ongoing analysis of care and its effects on patient recovery,
cravings, and relapses. MCC will use the database to measure clinical,
medical, behavioral, emotional, and economic outcomes. Factors measured
include abuse levels, quality of life, social functioning, employment
status, medical status, and duration of abstinence.

The project aims to separate the effects of treatment from other influences
on outcomes, gauge success rates for various treatment approaches, examine
variations among therapists, and determine cost-effectiveness of treatment.
Patients' pretreatment baseline data will be compared with posttreatment
data.

The firm also plans to use the data to tell employers if they are spending
enough, or too much, on substance abuse treatment. The Institute for a
Drug-Free Workplace estimates U.S. employers lose $60 billion a year
through drug abuse-related accidents, medical claims, absenteeism, theft,
and lost productivity.

MCC plans to analyze the pilot data in October, when it will begin to
expand the program to all its sites. The MCC network includes 1,500
inpatient and outpatient facilities. MCC covers 5 million individuals. It
estimates 150,000 to 250,000 of those individuals will have substance abuse
problems each year.

The project aims to set scientific standards in an area of care
traditionally viewed as rife with ambiguity. "Until now care has been based
on clinical judgment. In the '90s, we are finally beginning to practice
empirical health care," says Robert Kane, MD, head of the research team at
the University of Minnesota's Center for Health Services Research and
Policy. Once the pilot study for the substance abuse system is over and the
program is in place throughout the network, MCC says it will begin work on
similar systems for depression and anxiety.

Vasectomy May Increase
Risk of Prostate Cancer

Two studies of a total of 73,000 men point to a link between vasectomy and
an elevated risk of developing prostate cancer. Researchers say the cancer
risk increases over time following the procedure, but they are unable to
pinpoint the correlation's cause. In light of the studies' findings, the
American Urological Assn. (AUA) is recommending that younger vasectomized
men follow guidelines established by the AUA and the American Cancer
Society for early detection of prostate cancer in men ages 50 -70.

The NIH-sponsored studies, one prospective and one retrospective, found
that men who had a vasectomy more than 20 years ago have up to an 89
percent "elevated risk" of developing prostate cancer. Both studies,
conducted by Edward Giovannucci, MD, of Harvard University and Brigham and
Women's Hospital, and colleagues appeared in the Feb. 17 Journal of the
American Medical Association.

The prospective study began in 1986 and compared 10,055 40- to 75-year-old
health professionals who had had a vasectomy with 37,800 similar men who
had not. Three hundred cases of prostate cancer appeared in the
vasectomized group between 1986 and 19 90. This group had no previous
cancer history. Baseline data were taken at the study's outset, and follow-
up questionnaires were collected in 1988 and 1990. The overall increased
risk of prostate cancer in the vasectomy group is 66 percent -- a figure
that rises to 85 percent 22 years post-vasectomy.

The retrospective study used a questionnaire that had been administered in
1976. Researchers followed up in 1989 with reports on 13,034 men with
vasectomies and 12,306 without. The researchers found an overall 56 percent
increase in prostate cancer for the vasectomy group. It was in this group
that the risk rose to 89 percent 20 years post-vasectomy.

"The mechanisms that might link vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer
remain undefined," the researchers say. The studies were designed to rule
out "detection bias" and causal effects from smoking, alcohol consumption,
level of physical activity, diet, educational level, body mass index, and
geographical area of residence. Because the risk factors for prostate
cancer remain unknown, the researchers say it is "impossible" to "ensure
that the true risk factors" were equally distributed among the cohorts.

While the researchers argue that the increased risk over time rules out
better detection in vasectomized men, "bias was not properly addressed,"
says Marc Goldstein, MD, director of male reproduction and microsurgery at
the New York Hospital/Cornell University's department of urology. Goldstein
says that because all the vasectomized men had seen a urologist pre- and
post-surgery, "Diagnosis of prostate cancer goes up. This clearly explains
the difference."

The AUA immediately released an official statement upon the studies'
publication that warns the suggested relationship "does not mean that men
who have had a vasectomy should seek a reversal of the procedure" because
"the data are far too preliminary ." Four previous studies found a link
between vasectomy and prostate cancer, while three others did not.

The AUA does caution, however, "If vasectomy is a risk factor for prostate
cancer, people need to know and informed choices need to be made." Prostate
cancer is now the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men.
One in 11 men in the United States will develop prostate cancer, the
majority of whom will not have had a vasectomy. More than 15 percent of
American men over 40 have had a vasectomy.

The AUA/ACS guidelines for men between the ages of 50 and 70 advise annual
rectal examinations and testing for serum prostatic antigen levels. The AUA
is now saying that men who had a vasectomy more than 20 years ago, or when
they were over 40 years old, should get exams and tests regardless of their
age.

508/481-6400.

o The American Hospital Assn. is sponsoring a teleconference Mar. 18, on
implementing clinical practice guidelines in hospitals. The teleconference
will include case studies from the Henry Ford Medical Group, Mt. Sinai
Hospital, and Dartmouth Medical School. Participants include the AMA's John
Kelly, MD, and Dartmouth's John Wennberg, MD. Call 800/999-4AHA to either
hook up your hospital to the conference or to find out the location of a
hospital near you receiving the broadcast.

o Corporate CEO Survey -- In a recent survey of commercial insurers and
Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, nearly 40 percent of CEOs said they plan
to develop outcomes management programs in the next five years. Twenty
percent say they have such a pro gram in place already. The survey was
conducted by management consulting firm Towers Perrin. Donald Santoski,
principal at Towers Perrin, is predicting that eventually "outside rating
services" will be offering consumers comparative performance data on
hospitals and clinics.

Guidelines in the Courtroom:
Great Expectations

I think you have to help doctors stop practicing defensive medicine. I've
recommended that our doctors be given a set of national practice guidelines
and if they follow these guidelines, it raises the presumption that they
didn't do anything wrong. -- Bill Clinton, presidential debate, Oct. 15,
1992.

As policymakers prepare to attack health care costs with various proposals,
many are lining up malpractice spending in their sights. The weapon most of
them are aiming: practice guidelines.

Recent estimates place potential savings from malpractice reform at a
projected $36 billion over the next five years. It is still unclear,
however, whether better guidelines would indeed lower the cash awards and
number of malpractice cases through fostering better care, or whether they
would serve to increase malpractice awards and cases by giving plaintiffs'
attorneys more ammunition in court.

"I am currently working on an Administration task force looking at
malpractice reform, and we are definitely examining practice guidelines as
alternatives," Kathleen Hastings, director of the Agency for Health Care
Policy & Research's (AHCPR) Legal Medicine Program, told a gathering of
policymakers and analysts earlier this month in Washington DC.

The group, convened by the Assn. of Academic Health Centers (AHC) to
investigate the rapidly growing bond between guidelines and the law,
explored topics including whether federally produced guidelines would soon
take legal precedence over those produced by states and private
organizations. The AHC is a not-for-profit health care education
organization with over 100 institutional members in the United States and
Canada.

Maine is the first state to battle malpractice costs with a legal defense
for physicians who follow state-sponsored guidelines. The federal
government taking that same route "is possible but not likely," says Gordon
Smith, legal counsel to the Maine Medical Assn. and chief expert on the
Maine law, pointing to the U.S.' tradition of handling tort laws on a
state-by-state basis.

The move in most states' courtrooms, however, has been toward acceptance of
standards produced on a national level, whether by government agency or
specialty society, says Troyen Brennan, MD. A national approach must
account for regional differences in standards of care, such as those in
rural areas versus inner cities; conflicting standards, such as
disagreements over mammography screening; and uneven resource distribution,
cautions Brennan, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. AHCPR's Hastings counters that
nationally produced guidelines "can be tailored to a local level later."

The American Medical Assn. wants to see guidelines legislation for
malpractice defense remain at the state level, at least for now. The
science of guidelines creation is "still in its infancy, not reliable
enough to mandate nationally," says Ed Hirshfeld, the AMA's associate
general counsel for health law.

Hirshfeld told the group that the AMA's policy asserts that guidelines,
which it calls parameters, should retain their current status alongside
peer-reviewed studies and expert witnesses as "simply one source of
evidence" among many that judges and juries should consider in malpractice
cases. The AMA is concerned that mandating practice patterns nationwide
might stifle creativity in clinical research, technology, and drug
development, and other "experimentation in the margins," creating a
chilling effect. Mandating standards of care on a national level would also
damage efforts to fine-tune those standards, Hirshfeld says.

One advantage of the Maine law, which has yet to be tested in court, is
that it will stop "the battle of the experts" on the witness stand, says
Smith. Maine's "affirmative defense" stands in contrast to President
Clinton's recommendation of raising "presumption" against physician
wrongdoing, because presumption will leave the defense wide open for
rebuttal from plaintiff's attorneys and their hired guns, Smith predicts.

Conflicting testimony on scientific evidence that points in several
directions already has courts in a quandary, says Franklin Zweig, senior
staff scientist at George Washington University's Center for Health Policy
Research. Merely blocking attempts to weave guidelines into federal law
"won't stop the issue from being litigated in courts," warns Zweig, who
recommends health care professionals take advantage of this early stage in
guidelines litigation by moving forward to educate trial judges so they
can recognize valid, scientifically sound practices.

Judges are ripe for educational efforts, says Zweig. In a recent random-
sample survey conducted by his Center, trial judges rated medical practice
guidelines as third among topics for which they want more information.
Alcoholism science and genetic-based criminal evidence came in first and
second. Zweig attributes this desire to know more to the growing number and
complexity of health-related cases currently winding their way through the
courts. Many of those cases will soon have practice guidelines as their
main core of evidence, regardless of who created them or whether they are
mandated. -- D.S.

Three States Join Maine
With Malpractice Defense Laws

Maine was the first state to pass legislation tying practice guidelines to
malpractice defense. To date, three other states have approached the
'guidelines as defense' arena as part of state health care reform
legislation:

Vermont's Universal Access statute, passed in 1992 and awaiting adoption in
Jan. 1994, will allow practice guidelines "recognized by state law" as
admissible evidence in cases judging whether a provider "met or failed to
meet the applicable standard of care." The state calls upon provider
organizations, hospitals, and quality assurance programs to draft the state
guidelines. The statute also establishes a nonbinding arbitration system
for all medical liability claims.

Under its Health Care Reform Act of 1992, Florida mandates the "adoption
and implementation" of "scientifically sound medical practice parameters"
to eliminate "unwarranted" variations in health care delivery. Physicians
participating in a demonstration project between June of this year and Oct.
1, 1998, will be able to use compliance with the parameters as an
"affirmative defense" similar to the one established in Maine. The statute
also calls for periodic reviews and revisions of the parameters to ensure
they are based on the latest scientific findings. The state plans to
address overall tort reform in upcoming legislative sessions.

As part of its reform legislation, Minnesota's 1992 HealthRight Act
established a program to develop, adopt, revise, and disseminate practice
parameters, drawing from those developed within the state and those created
by AHCPR and national specialty societies. Under the Act, adherence to the
state-sanctioned guidelines is an "absolute defense" giving the defendant
an automatic win -- a sharp contrast to Maine's "affirmative defense." The
absolute defense is suspended in cases involving delay in diagnosis,
misdiagnosis, inappropriate application of the parameter, or failure to
obtain informed consent.
