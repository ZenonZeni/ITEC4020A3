<H3>DOE, LOCKHEED MARTIN PROJECT 
TO INCREASE UTILITY EFFICIENCY, CUT COSTS</H3><P>

	The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Lockheed Martin Corporation have announced a partnership to produce a device that will reduce the serious damage caused by electrical current surges, without interfering with normal power flows.  The High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) fault current limiter is expected to provide significant cost savings and operational efficiency for the utility industry, with benefits passed to consumers through lower electrical bills and improved power quality.
	The fault limiter team, lead by Lockheed Martin's Energy & Power Systems unit, includes Southern California Edison, Intermagnetics General Corporation and DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory. <P>
	The $8.4 million, cost-shared project to build and test a 15-kilovolt, fault current limiter is the next step toward commercialization of the device and one of four industry-lead Superconductivity Partnership Initiative (SPI) projects funded by DOE.  The SPI is a two-year program involving cost-shared cooperative agreements with industry to develop and commercialize new high temperature superconducting (HTS) components for electric power systems.  The fault current limiter project could be the first commercial application of HTS.<P>


	The capacity of an electric power system to withstand high, short-circuit current is essential to a stable system.  Systems without this capability are subject to safety hazards, equipment damage and revenue loss.  Traditionally, large resistors or series reactors are used to limit short circuit currents to safe levels.  Existing system designs limit current not only during disturbances, but also under normal operating conditions, thereby weakening the entire system. <P>
	The new HTS current fault limiter can reduce current only during surge conditions, allowing an electrical system to operate efficiently and cost effectively during fault current disruptions.  Such disruptions can be caused by a variety of conditions, including equipment failures, lightning strikes, falling tree branches, kites, animals shorting the circuits or metallic balloons landing on wires, etc. <P>
	The project is one of the most near-term HTS applications and builds on Lockheed Martin's successful first phase: development of a 2.4-kilovolt fault current limiter for electric utility application.  The new device is to be built and tested by mid-1997, with commercial units available shortly thereafter.  Benefits of this technology directly correlate with the utility industry's ability to successfully compete in a deregulation environment. <P>
	"Industry's partnership with DOE on the HTS fault current limiter is speeding the success of this program," said Christine Ervin, DOE Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.  "By working together, the public and private sector can develop technologies to improve energy efficiency and commercialize the technology, which can also mean lower costs and improved power quality for utilities and savings for the consumer."<P>
	The U.S. Department of Commerce projects an annual world market of $5 billion for HTS devices by the end of the century with the primary market sector being the electric utility industry.  DOE's Superconductivity Partnership Initiative, by accelerating development of products, will help improve U.S. technological competitiveness and leadership in the international marketplace.
