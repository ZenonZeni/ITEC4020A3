<font size=+3><b>3C Poised for Technology Payoff</font></b>
</center>

<hr>
<i>by Joshua Levine</i><p>

<img src="../caps/mcap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="M">r. Nguyen Quang A, chairman of Hanoi-based 3C Inc., might not be sure of the precise angle, but he is betting that by spreading into various areas of technology the company will rise to prominence in one or more areas. In part due to lack of competition, it seems to be happening for 3C across the board. Nothing excites him more than one subsidiary, BaTIN (Business and Technology Information Network), where he proudly shows a recent visitor a web page as smart looking as any. Ironically, the designers of the page can't access the Internet from Vietnam, so they designed it from books. The company is now poised to jockey for a high profile spot when the country moves "online." They also market a web-page design service.<p>

While the Internet aspect of 3C is exotic and gives Mr. A a reason to network worldwide, the privately-owned company, of which Mr. A owns a large minority, has been focused on computers and technology since 1989. An initial investment of $25,000 by 17 shareholders in 1991 provided an official license as a private enterprise. Today, 3C has assets valued at $1.8 million, largely derived from trading Singaporean PCs with the former Soviet Union and installing computer networks.<p>

Targeting a practically non-existent market enabled 3C to invest profits in real estate and equity in several commercial banks, and since then it has established itself in "information technology," with offices in Hanoi and HCMC. The firm is divided into 3C Computer, 3C Communications and 3C Control. 3C Control designs and manufactures precise electronic scales, industrial measuring equipment and switches.<p>

3C Computer, which expected a rise in turnover from $6 million and profits of $300,000 in 1995 to $17 million turnover and $2.25 million in profits by 1999, is an authorized dealer for Digital Equipment Corp., Compaq, NEC printers, and Hypercom banking and financial networking products, as well as certain Siemens products. It offers all technology-related consulting and, on this front, competes with Gen Pacific and FPT. The firm also develops and markets an array of Vietnamese fonts, drivers, and business software.<p>

BaTIN is under 3C Communications and already offers some limited Internet services such as email. At the same time, it is posturing with other connected firms to win the right to provide "gateway" services, the profitable internet middle-man position. The atmosphere of BaTIN is that of a classic Silicon Valley computer lab and it is obvious that Mr. A is looking forward to enjoying the fruits of his laboratories as well as the process.<p>

3C's board of directors includes the president of VP Bank, a former president of Vietnam Maritime Corp., and an Asian Commercial Bank executive.<p>
