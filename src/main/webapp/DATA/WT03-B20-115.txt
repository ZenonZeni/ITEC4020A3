Buildings</title></head><body>
<h1>Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in Buildings</h1>  <p>
<p>
Buildings include residential, commercial, institutional, and federal
structures. Energy efficiency and renewable energy in buildings encompass

building design, building materials, heating, cooling, lighting, and
appliances.<p>
<p>
<h2>Current Use and Cost</h2>
U.S. buildings consume 36% of the country's energy supply at a cost of
$193 billion--nearly as much as the combined annual sales of General
Motors Corporation and Exxon in 1993, and energy use is growing at a rate 
of
3.3% a year.<p>

Including the fossil fuel used to generate the electricity, commercial
buildings account for more than 15% of U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions;
residential buildings account for 19%.<p>
<p>
<h2>Building Design</h2>
Passive solar buildings are being built today that save as much as 50% on

heating bills for only 1% more in construction costs.<p>
Exemplary buildings--which use the sun, efficient technologies, and the
environment to provide for a building's heating, cooling, and lighting
requirements--will reduce energy bills by as much as 75%. And these 
buildings
cost no more than conventional buildings.<p>

New building technologies, such as low-emissivity (low-E) windows, 
compact
fluorescent lights, and energy-efficient clothes washers and dryers,
dishwashers, refrigerators, and freezers have created new business
opportunities and growth markets. <p>
<p>
<h2>Building Materials</h2>
Poorly insulated windows account for 25% of all heating and cooling
requirements in the United States at a cost of $22 billion--more than the

annual sales of Shell Oil Company in 1993. This is equivalent to the 
amount of
energy flowing through the Alaskan pipeline each year.<p>
New insulating foams do not use chlorofluorocarbon blowing agents or 
materials
and have the same superior thermal and physical characteristics as those 
they
replace. <p>
<p>
<h2>Heating and Cooling</h2>
Heating and cooling equipment consumes 42% of all building energy use at 
a cost
of $81 billion--nearly twice the dollar amount of Chrysler Corporation's 
annual
sales in 1993. <p>

A transpired solar collector--which is a dark, perforated metal 
wall--converts
up to 80% of the sunlight striking it into heated ventilation air for
commercial buildings.<p>

Residential natural gas absorption heat pumps with more than a 50% 
improvement
in heating efficiency over the best gas furnaces will be available in 
1997. By
2000, those units will be improved to provide over 50% more efficient 
cooling
than the best current absorption air conditioning units.<p>

Commercial gas cooling units that are 50% better than the best existing
absorption chillers will be available by 1998.<p>
<p>
Lighting and Appliances<p>
Lighting accounts for about 25% or $44.25 billion of all electricity 
consumed
in the United States--more than the annual sales of the Chrysler 
Corporation in
1993. <p>

Compact fluorescent lamps consume 75% to 85% less electricity than do
incandescent ones and, typically, last 4 to 5 times longer than 
incandescent
flood lamps and 9 to 13 times longer than ordinary incandescent bulbs.<p>

Appliances (other than heating and cooling) use 40% of all electricity 
consumed
in residential and commercial buildings. This equates to a cost of $54.6
billion dollars in 1991.<p>

Energy efficiency standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, 
clothes
washers, clothes dryers, and dishwashers are expected to save 
approximately 20
quadrillion Btu (equal to 24% of the nation's energy use in 1992) of 
energy
during 1993 to 2015.<p>

Beginning with some 1997 models, refrigerator walls and doors will have
advanced vacuum insulation panels which have five times the insulating 
value of
current units. <p>
<p>
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
The Federal Energy Management Program will reduce energy use in federal
buildings 30% by 2005, based on 1985 use. This will save taxpayers more 
than
$1 billion dollars a year by the year 2000.<p>
