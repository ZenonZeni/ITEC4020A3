Trans Union / DATEQ provides database information services to
the property and casualty insurance industry to assist insurance
companies in accurately assessing underwriting risks. Trans Union / DATEQ
products are available only to insurance companies, agents and
pre-employment companies. Information from DATEQ helps insurance
companies feel confident that insurance premiums are not inadequate,
excessive or unfairly discriminatory. Careful drivers expect careless
drivers to pay more for their insurance. Insuring that each driver is
evaluated on his/her individual risk ultimately improves highway safety.
This site provides current information on highway safety, accident facts
and safe driving tips.
