&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Named by their Polynesian discoverers Te Henua Enata or the "Land of Men," the Marquesas islands are located about 700 miles northeast of Tahiti.  This archipelago was the first of the Polynesian Islands to be discovered by the western world, when Alvaro de Mendafia stumbled upon them in 1595 in his quest to rediscover the Solomon Islands.  The Spanish Admiral named them "Islas de Marquesas" in honor of the wife of his patron Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, the Viceroy of Spain in Peru.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Spaniards were well received by the natives <IMG SRC="windsong.gif" ALT="windsong.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=230  BORDER=2>but their signs of welcome were misunderstood.  When a group of some forty men and children boarded the vessels and, carried away by their natural curiosity, started touching the pale skin and feeling the clothes of the explorers the Spaniards became annoyed.  Soon the islanders, probably with the desire to bring proof ashore of this extraordinary encounter, started stealing handker-chiefs, hats and other personal objects.  In response, the Spaniards ordered the cannon to be shot.  In following days more than two hundred people were killed due to further misunderstandings.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the next one hundred and eighty years the islands were forgotten by the Europeans.  Their second visitor was Captain James Cook in 1775.  In 1791, Captain Joseph Ingraham arrived on board a Boston based whaling ship and named the group the Washington Islands.  In the following years the island was visited by numerous whalers and Herman Melville, after deserting from one of them, spent one month in the Taipivai valley and later wrote his book Typee.  Jacques Brel and Paul Gaugin were also drawn to, and inspired by, these enchanted islands<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of volcanic origin, the ridges of the Marquesas tower up to 4000 feet above sea level.  Each island is divided longitudinally by a backbone of jagged volcanic peaks, and many ridges lead as ribs from this mountainous backbone directly to the sea.  The valleys are deep and narrow, with steep ridges and spurs that fall sharply into the rough ocean.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are a large number of endemic plants and birds, such as the white capped fruit dove, ultramarine lorikeet, lphis monarch, the Marquesas reed warbler and swiflet, and literally hundreds of thousands of nesting sooty terns.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cultural and linguistic materials indicate that the first settlers of the Marquesas, whether by accident or intent, originated in Western Polynesia.  They may have arrived as early as the 2nd century BC and, probably over a period of many voyages, succeeded in introducing to the Marquesas all of their plants of economic value - bananas, sugar cane and yams.  Breadfruit and taro were main staples, and fermented breadfruit paste was preserved in enormous underground silos.  Taro was planted on irrigated terraces covering most of a valley’s floor.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is speculated that the Marquesas Islands were the first to be settled in Eastern Polynesia, and that it was from here that the Polynesians inhabited Easter Island, Hawaii, and the northern Tuamotus groups.  It is probable that their cultural sphere could have included the Society Islands and extended as far south as Pitcairn and Mangareva.  Oral traditions, linguistics and common cultural traits are evidence of a long history of contact between these islands.  Rock art, specially petroglyphs, were very common and both Easter Island and Hawaii share an important set of Marquesas motifs.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the ages as the population grew every valley became inhabited by various tribes, and in the larger valleys there were sometimes several unrelated settlements occupying land between the rivers.  Every tribe had its chief, who lived in a large tribal center where all festivals and other social activities took place.  These centers, named "Taha Koina", consisted always of a rectangular, paved dancing ground surrounded by stone platforms on which temporary houses would be erected.  The recently restored Taha Koina of the valley of Taa'oa on Hiva Oa could hold close to ten thousand people during these festivals.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On one end of the dancing platform, or in its close proximity, <IMG SRC="tiki.gif" ALT="tiki.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=200>there was a sacrificial platform (Me'ae) and the high priest's house.  These high priests sometimes acquired enormous power and fame during their life time and their spirits would become tutelary deities of the tribe.  The priests were good ventriloquists and made the people believe that the wooden and stone statues (Tikis) that represented deified tribal ancestors spoke to them.  They would be in charge of consecrating new objects and other tribal belongings, and would live with their assistants, who were in charge of handling, killing and disposing of the sacrificial victims that came from enemy or neighboring tribes.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Following in social order were the warriors - the tribe's pride - who lived in special houses and guarded fortresses that were built upon the ridges separating the valleys.  Profes-sional craftsmen also were con-sidered important.  They specialized in the building of houses, boats, fishhooks, stone adzes, fly whisks, tattooing, etc.  Fish were abundant in the surrounding waters, and an important part of the diet.  However, fishermen were considered the lowest class, sleeping in coastal shrines when fishing.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Marquesans created a very complex culture with highly developed art and sophisticated decorative designs.  Every object was elaborately carved - a tradition which still survives today.  The art of tattooing attained artistic perfection and the islanders became known for their full body tattoos.  In recent years there has been a revival of this tradition.  Many of the younger people now carry beautiful tattoos with great pride.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today’s Marquesans feel very proud of their history and traditions.  They have enhanced their cultural identity through an organization called Motu Haka, and by engaging in festivals which strengthen all traditional aspects of their culture - dance, weaving, wood carving, chants and traditional story telling.  The Marquesas are among those few alluring islands which remain to be explored.  To discover their colorful history is an opportunity that should not be missed.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Edmundo Edwards has worked on numerous archeological projects in the Marquesas islands over the last two decades.  He currently resides on Easter Island, and is an expert on the cultural history, as well as current affairs, of eastern Polynesia.  In addition to traveling aboard the Wind Song, he will lead several of our Easter Island extensions.<BR>
