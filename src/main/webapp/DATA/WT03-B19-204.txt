<H2>Australia</H2>
The Australian waste management and recycling market, including both domestic and industrial consumers, is currently estimated at over $3 billion.
<P>
Manufacturing industries in Australia spend over $1 billion on environmental protection and pollution abatement.  The biggest spenders are the steel, aluminium, chemicals and building materials industries.
<P>
Investment in sewerage systems in Australia over the next ten years is estimated at $13 billion.  Increasingly, work undertaken for public authorities is being outsourced which will lead to greater opportunities for private companies and consortia to be involved in the provision of infrastructure/services relating to waste water and sewerage systems.
<P>
The growing commitment to ecologically sustainable development is creating new markets, both locally and internationally, for environmental goods and services.
  <P>
Government and higher education institutions dominate environmental R&D spending.  In 1992-93 they spent $138 million compared with business spending of $39 million.
  <P>
Currently 35 public and private companies in Australia export environmental technology and expertise with estimated exports of $250-300 million.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
The existence of Melbourne as both a major population and economic centre, with its attendant waste management requirements, has resulted in numerous environmental industries either being based in Victoria or having a strong presence in the State.
<P>
Victorian manufacturing firms spent almost $300 million on environmental protection and pollution abatement.
  <P>
Around 800 manufacturing establishments sell or produce environment protection goods and services.  Recycling of post-industrial and post-consumer waste such as cardboard, plastics, scrap tyres and metal employs over 5,000 people, with an estimated capital investment of $1.5 billion.  Commodities such as paper, cardboard, glass, metals and some plastics are converted into value-added products with ready markets.
<P>
Companies based in Victoria such as Sinclair Knight, Kinhill Engineers, GH & D have developed a diverse range of waste management technologies and services both internationally and locally.
<P>
Exports of waste materials from Victoria are $30 million.  Firms supplying consultancy services and specialised technology are well placed to increase exports, especially in relation to waste water treatment plants and potable water.
<P>
Future investment in Victoria's waste management and recycling capacity include the construction by Amcor Australian Paper of a $50 million high technology waste paper recycling centre in the suburb of Fairfield.
  <P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The international demand for environmental protection services is expected to increase rapidly with estimates that Australia's exports in this sector will increase to around $1 billion by the year 2000.  A major potential market is Asia which the World Bank estimates will need to spend at least $200 billion in the next decade on waste control.
<P>
Exports of recyclable waste materials such as beverage containers, glass, iron, lead, plastics and precious metals from Australia are worth $250 million and there is considerable scope for further growth.
  <P>
The demand for environmental consultancy services should further expand as the need for firms to have accredited environment management systems in place increases.
