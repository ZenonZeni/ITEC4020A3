	The PISCES-A facility [1] (Fig.1) is used to investigate novel 
divertor and plasma edge management concepts (in particular gas target 
divertors), as well as edge plasma turbulence and transport.  The plasma 
source consists of a hot LaB6 cathode with an annular, water-cooled copper 
anode and attached drifttube.  The vacuum system includes four turbo-molecular 
pumps with a pumping speed of 1500 1/s each.  The plasma diameter can be 
adjusted between 3 and 10 cm by three independent magnet coils located in 
the source region.  The main chamber magnetic field (variable between 0.01 
and 0.19 T) is produced by four water-cooled coils.  The main diagnostics 
include: (1) motor driven water cooled Langmuir probes; (2) fast scanning 
probe assemblies capable of measuring radial density, floating and plasma 
potential, plasma flow velocities and Mach number profiles; (3) a 1.3 m 
Czerny-Turner monochromator with an OMA system; (4) a fast reciprocating 
probe for density and potential fluctuation measurements and the 
determination of fluctuation-induced transport; (5) several baratron and 
ionization gauges for neutral pressure measurements for neutral pressure 
measurements; (6) a CID camera; (7) an IR surface temperature monitor.  A 
CAMAC crate with slow and fast data loggers and a Micro Vax computer system 
is used for data acquisition and processing.<P>

	Differential pumping is employed to achieve a neutral gas pressure of 
2x10^-4 - 10^-2 torr in the plasma source, while keeping the main chamber 
pressure between 6x10^-5 and 2x10^-3 torr.  Plasma is produced in H2, D2, He, 
and Ar gas.  Plasma densities of 10^11-5x10^13 cm-3 in hydrogen and helium, 
and up to 1x10^14 cm-3 in argon have been achieved.  The electron temperature 
is in the range of 3 - 30 eV.  Neutral hydrogen densities inside the plasma 
are determined from absolutely calibrated Ha line intensities.  A Fabry-Perot 
etalon is used to measure the temperatures of main plasma ions, neutrals and 
various impurity species.

	The PISCES-A chamber provides good diagnostic access.  The fast 
scanning probe system has been extensively used for 2-D and 3-D mapping of 
plasma density and potential profiles during biased limiter and divertor 
simulation experiments and tests of magnetized probe theory and presheath 
measurements.  The PISCES-A plasma source is presently converted for higher 
density hydrogen operation in order to study plasma plugging effects in the 
gaseous divertor regime.  Pulsed operation will enable us to operate at a 
discharge current as high as 250 A.  The differential pumping capability is 
increased by installing a second turbomolecular pump at the plasma source.  
This allows plasma production at higher pressures while maintaining high 
electron temperature and ionization efficiency.<P>
