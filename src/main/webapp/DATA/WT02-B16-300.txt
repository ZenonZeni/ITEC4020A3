<B>Production of HBr from Bromine and Steam for Off-Peak <br>

Electrolytic Hydrogen Generation;<br>

<P>

Solar Reactor Technologies (SRT), Inc., is developing a unique,

innovative dual-function system to produce low-cost industrial

quantities of hydrogen and oxygen from water using renewable energy.

  In the first step of the process, concentrated solar radiation

is absorbed by bromine vapor in a high-temperature reactor, producing

bromine atoms.  The bromine atoms then react with water to produce

hydrogen bromine (HBr) and oxygen.  Finally, the stored HBr is

electrolyzed in the reversible electrochemical cell to produce

hydrogen, and the bromine is recovered.  The process can reduce

the electrical energy required to split water as much as 70%.

<P>

In a collaborative effort with the National Renewable Energy

Laboratory, Sandia (CA) National Laboratories, and Florida Solar

Energy Center, a 1-kW solar reactor was designed and constructed

during the first phase of this project.  It was used to gather

data from the reaction between bromine and steam at temperatures

between 900 and 1300 K, with and without concentrated solar radiation.

 We verified the predicted thermochemical behavior and observed

HBr conversion rates of 70% of the theoretical maximum.

An improved version of the bromine delivery system for the 1-kW

system was tested.  A Pyrex pipette was glass blown to a 1-cm

diam. frit.  Bromine delivery and pressurization tubes were added.

 A heating tape vaporized bromine after it exited the frit.  The

delivery rate increased with applied pressure.  At 0 psi, flow

rates of about 0.2 ml Br<sub>2</sub>/min were attained for a fine 
porosity

frit; at 6 psi, they were 2.0 ml/min.  Tests of the medium-porosity

frit showed that much higher flow rates could be realized:  0.1-5

ml/min for 0 psi and 9 ml/min at 2 psi.

The Pathfinder bromine and steam delivery systems were installed.

 On-sun testing with bromine and steam is continuing.  A safety

consultant hired by NREL inspected the system and offered suggestions.

 Modifications were made to the bromine delivery system.  The

bromine day tank was housed in a vented gas cabinet fitted with

a fire suppression system.  Water, electrical, air, bromine, and

ventilation lines were installed, and the feed and return lines

to the reactor were hooked up.  Only steam was passed through

the reactor in initial tests.  The steam delivery system, operated

well for flow rates between 5 and 15 g/min.  Advanced Fuel Research

(AFR) set up an FTIR apparatus and measured reactor steam temperatures

between 650&#176; and 900&#176;C.  These values were significantly

different from those recorded by thermocouples inserted in quartz

wells in the reactor.  Next, the bromine delivery system was tested.

 Reasonably constant flow rates were achieved between 5 and 15

g/min.  The day tank load cell was calibrated.  When bromine was

introduced into the reactor, AFR measured a 150&#176;-250&#176;C

increase in the steam temperature.  This was attributed to bromine

molecules absorbing a significant amount of the solar flux (ca.

20%).  Upon photo-dissociating, they impart a significant portion

of their kinetic energy to surrounding bromine and water molecules

upon recombination.  The highest temperature recorded was 1075&#176;C

with only 2.5 kW of incident power.  Samples  were collected under

conditions of varying solar power and input bromine mole fraction.

 This translated into different reactor residence times, local

gas temperatures, and bromine conversion efficiencies.  At the

same time, AFR measured the instantaneous reactor [Hbr].  They

showed that [Hbr] increased with reactor temperature for a fixed

input bromine mole fraction.  According to preliminary data analysis,

conversion efficiencies up to 20% were attained for a 1-2 second

residence time.  During the last two weeks of testing, a molecular

beam mass spectrometer was calibrated and tested.  Initial operation

detected HBr formation in on-sun experiments.  H<sub>2</sub>O, Br, 
Br<sub>2</sub>, and

O<sub>2</sub> were detected as well.  Neutralization of bromine and 
H<sub>2</sub>O/HBr/Br<sub>2</sub> mixtures with sodium thiosulphate 

and sodium bicarbonate was demonstrated.
