<center><h2>VALIDITY OF INSURANCE</h2></center>
<p>
This insurance is only available to persons under 75 years of age who are resident in the USA or Canada and who do not hold a passport issued by the country in which they are resident i.e. US nationals or passport holders residing in the USA are not eligible for this plan. Coverage under a plan shall be restricted to the Proposer, Spouse and dependent children only. The plan does not cover any pre existing medical conditions (please see Main Exclusion 10) and you should pay particular attention to the various medical questions and the Declaration contained within this proposal form.
<p>
<center><h2>SYNOPSIS OF COVER</h2></center>
<p>
This is a brief synopsis of the cover provided. The full terms, conditions and exclusions are available upon request.
<p>
Each plan provides cover for full reimbursement of medical expenses up to the limit stated (subject to a deductible applicable to each and every claim) necessarily incurred during the period of insurance and for up to 24 months after the date of accident or illness. Also included is personal accident cover in the event of accidental death, loss of limb(s), eye(s) or permanent total disablement. If under 16 years or aged 65 years or over benefit in the event of accidental death shall be limited to $5,000. Additionally persons aged 65 years or over will not be eligible for permanent total disablement benefit.
<p>
As an additional benefit, the Expatriate Protection Plans include the services of a 24 hour medical assistance company, details of which will be included in the policy documentation.
<p>
<center><h2>DEDUCTIBLES APPLICABLE TO ALL PLANS</center></h2>
<p>
From each and every claim, each insured person there shall be deducted the sum of $150. If required the proposer may increase the deductible and pay a lower premium. To increase the deductible please reduce the premium applicable to each insured person by the following percentages:
<p>
To increase the deductible to $250 - reduce the premium by 5%
<p>
To increase the deductible to $500 - reduce the premium by 10%
<p>
To increase the deductible to $1,000 - reduce the premium by 25%
<p>
<h2><center>BUDGET PLAN</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Coverage per person MEDICAL EXPENSES up to $150,000 PERSONAL ACCIDENT up to $10,000.</b>
<p>
Covers costs and expenses incurred in the USA or Canada only. This plan is ideally suited to those persons who are temporarily based in the USA/Canada and/or have family who remain in the country for which passports are held but in any event for those persons who have continued to pay national/state contributions or who have medical expense arrangements in the country for which they hold a passport. This is an important aspect of the Budget Plan as when medically necessary an injured or sick person will be compulsorily repatriated. Repatriation shall be deemed necessary if a qualified medical practitioner estimates that hospitalisation shall be in excess of four weeks. Following repatriation medical expense reimbursement shall cease under the plan. If however a full recovery is made during the period of cover, as certified by a qualified medical practitioner, this plan shall pay the cost of one economy class transportation back to the USA/Canada whereupon coverage may be reinstated.
<p>
<center><h2>STANDARD PLAN</center></h2>
<p>
<b>Coverage per person MEDICAL EXPENSES up to $750,000 PERSONAL ACCIDENT up to $15,000</b>
<p>
Cover as per BUDGET PLAN but including costs and expenses incurred anywhere in the world excluding the country for which a passport is held. Compulsory repatriation is not a condition of cover under the STANDARD PLAN.
<p>
<center><h2>SUPER PLAN</center></h2>
<p>
<b>Coverage per person MEDICAL EXPENSES up to $1,500,000 PERSONAL ACCIDENT up to $20,000</b>
<p>
Cover as STANDARD PLAN plus 90 days HOMECOVER (up to $75,000) whilst temporarily in the country for which a passport is held.
