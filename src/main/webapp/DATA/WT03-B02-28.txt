Reform moves to state arena, loses some ground.  


With the federal government focusing on other issues, health care reform
shifted back to the states, where it suffered some setbacks.  Opposition from
small business employers and Republican control of more state legislatures put
reform issues on hold or reversed them.  Massachusetts' "play or pay" law,
which would have taxed employers who did not offer their workers health
coverage, was tabled for the third time in seven years.  Washington state
dismantled a law requiring employers to pay for group health coverage, and
Vermont opted out of a single-payer system proposal.  Groundwork was laid,
however, for expansion of coverage due to a recent U.S.  Supreme Court
decision in a New York case.  The court found that a surcharge on hospital
bills is not pre-empted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.  Other
states are now expected to enact their own surcharges to fund coverage for
uninsured individuals.

Risk managers want OSHA reform issue resolved.  


Paul Brown, director of government affairs for the Risk & Insurance Management
Society, is hoping that Congress will resolve the issue this year.  "We were
happy to see them take up the OSHA reform issue and look forward to continue
working on developing an adequate reform bill," he said.

"Growing pains" predicted for health care industry in 1996.  


According to business futurist Roger Herman, jobs in health care will
increase, but employee turnover will affect productivity.  Employers will have
to offer better pay and benefits to hold onto employees.

Wellness programs reduce employer health care costs.  


A study by the Wellness Program Management Advisor shows that such programs
can cut costs by as much as 30 percent.  Thirty-eight percent of respondents
said that health screenings had the greatest effect on costs.  Nutrition, high
blood pressure and stress management were also found to reduce costs.  Only
two percent of respondents said they saw a rise in health care expenses after
implementing wellness programs.

Medical fee schedules most popular cost control measure.  


Forty states now use medical fee schedules as a method of containing workers'
compensation costs, according to a study by the Workers' Compensation Research
Institute.  Hospital payment regulation is used by 35 states, and a change of
provider limit is used by 32 states.  Restrictions on provider changes is the
fastest-growing method of cost containment; 13 states enacted such
restrictions this year.

Poll shows general dissatisfaction with health care.  


Fewer than 2 in 10 respondents were satisfied with the nation's health care
system, according to a Louis Harris poll.  Twelve percent said they couldn't
get needed treatment in 1995, and 15 percent had to wait at least a week to
get an appointment with a physician.  More than 80 percent of respondents said
the health care system is too bureaucratized.  Responses were somewhat better
than a poll taken five years ago, when only 1 in 10 said they were satisfied
with the system.

Carrier expands comp coverage through new endorsements.  


ITT Hartford Insurance Group is now marketing two endorsements which enable
employers to broaden workers' compensation coverage.  The first, available at
no extra charge to eligible risks, expands coverage in six different areas,
including employers liability stop gap and voluntary compensation.  The
second, available at 1.5 to 3 percent of the standard premium, expands
coverage in 11 areas, such as business trips to foreign countries and an
increase in employers' liability bodily injury limits.  It also includes the
six areas covered in the first new endorsement.

Health Insurance Plan of California brings in some employers, but many workers
still uncovered.


Although the HIPC has enrolled more than 5,000 employers and covers nearly
100,000 workers, uninsured employees are still a problem in the Golden State.
In Los Angeles County alone, four out of five are workers or their dependents,
according to a study by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.  A large
share of L.A.  workers are paid too little to afford coverage, and their
employers have profit margins too small to provide coverage.  "A relatively
large group of employers are still marginally profitable, and an incremental
increase in expenses may put them over the edge," said Richard Figueroa, an
HIPC state manager.  Of the employers that the HIPC has signed up during its
two years of operation, only 20 percent were previously uninsured.

New York slated for comp reform.  


In his state of the state address, Gov.  George Pataki called for major
changes in many of the state's programs and procedures, including workers'
compensation and unemployment insurance.  The National Federation of
Independent Business applauded the governor's message.  "It's not just the
state and local taxes that have dulled small business growth, " said Mark P.
Alesse, NFIB's state director.  "Costly employer mandates like workers' comp
and UI have depressed small business job creation, too.  With real reform this
session, we are confident that small business will respond with substantial
new job opportunities."  The New York Workers' Compensation Action Network,
which represents 7,000 businesses statewide, praised the governor's plan to
implement a managed care system, a reform the group has sought for several
years.  Senate Democratic Leader Martin Connor was not as confident.  "The
governor forgets to mention that his health care plans will probably lead to
the closing of many hospitals and thousands of layoffs," he warned.

Concern over ADA kills New Jersey HIV exclusion testing.  


The proposed regulation would have enabled group health insurers to test for
the human immunodeficiency virus and deny coverage based on test results
(SNCHB 10-23-95).  Insurance Commissioner Elizabeth Randall said that the
proposal most likely violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as
state insurance regulations that bar unfair discrimination.

Pennsylvania small businesses urge passage of comp reform bill.  


H.B.  2216, up before the state legislature this session, would reduce
workers' compensation costs for smaller employers currently facing increases
under the proposed "loss cost" filing.  The bill would change calculation of
average weekly wages to reflect actual yearly earnings; offset benefits by the
amount received in Social Security, pension, and severance benefits; prohibit
payment of disability benefits when the worker is earning wages equal to or
greater than pre-injury wages; provide safe employer discounts of five percent
on annual premiums; and permit employers to control medical care for 180 days
instead of 30 days.  Nearly 5,000 businesses are participating in the
campaign, spearheaded by SMC Business Councils, the Pennsylvania Business
Association and the Chamber Summit.  Small businesses make up over 95 percent
of all businesses in the state.

Other Keystone State bills would clarify emergency coverage for HMO members.


State Senators Roy C.  Afflerbach and Jim Gerlach have introduced two bills
that would broaden emergency room treatment coverage for members of health
maintenance organizations.  The Gerlach bill would define an emergency for the
purposes of insurance coverage, and the Afflerbach bill would guarantee
emergency care to stabilize the patient, including 24-hour authorization
access for members.  The senators are responding to complaints from patients
whose managed health care providers have refused to pay for emergency
treatment when the symptoms were later determined not to constitute an
emergency under the medical insurers definition.  "Common sense tells you that
people with perfectly good health insurance don't get up in the middle of the
night and rush to the hospital unless they honestly believe they are having a
medical emergency," said Afflerbach.

Ohio Blue Cross/Blue Shield to base copayments on negotiated discounts.  


After a long year of complaints and court battles, the Blues have stopped the
practice of basing insured copayments on regular hospital rates rather than
the discounted rates the Blues actually pay.  And starting the first of this
month, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ohio will incorporate the discounts into
copayment billings.  Still pending is a court case in Toledo, where a federal
judge is still to decide whether the Blues must pay restitution to insureds.

Florida reform helping many to obtain health care coverage.  


Since its formation in 1994, the Community Health Purchasing Alliance has
enrolled over 14,000 businesses in the state, covering more than 63,000
individuals.  The CHPA is a non-profit group designed to help small businesses
of 1 to 50 employees afford to offer health insurance to their workers.
Purchasing alliances for small businesses are currently available in 15
states.  With more alliances in the process of forming, the number of states
is expected to climb to 23.

South Carolina comp costs will continue to drop.  


The National Council on Compensation Insurance reports that slow economic
growth and a move toward trade and service jobs will continue to lower the
state's workers' comp costs.  Key factors are a decline in defense and other
manufacturing industries such as textiles, similar to the changes in the
Northeast.  As workers shift to less hazardous jobs, comp costs will continue
to decrease.  "Workers' compensation voluntary loss costs fell 13.9 percent in
1995 and residual market rates dropped by 1.9 percent," said William D.
Hager, NCCI president.  South Carolina's lower unemployment rate has also had
a positive impact on comp costs, dropping from 7.5 percent in 1993 to 5.0
percent in 1995.  The rate is expected to remain below 5.2 percent over the
next two years.

Two more managed care providers adopt 24-hour health hotline.  


Minnesota's Care on Call provides callers with treatment for their symptoms
over the phone.  Developed jointly by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota
and HealthSystem Minnesota, the service puts callers through to registered
nurses who use physician-approved guidelines to treat non-emergency
conditions, similar to medical hotlines in other states (SNCHB, 10-9-95).  The
nurses also phone in prescriptions and set up doctor appointments for callers.

Texas comp carriers given rate reduction ultimatum.  


The Texas Department of Insurance gave insurers until February 1 to cut or
justify their workers' compensation rates or prepare for possible rollback
hearings.  Letters were sent to 17 insurer groups that write workers' comp in
the state, including Aetna, Allstate, Nationwide, Reliance and Zurich.  These
groups have 74 companies that write comp coverage, accounting for a seventh of
the state's market.  "The carriers have known for months of my concern that
workers' compensation rates are too high," said Insurance Commissioner Elton
Bomer, "particularly rates for small businesses."  He added that although some
insurers have reduced their rates due to savings created from a 1989 reform
law, more than a few have not responded.  "Some carriers have persisted in
charging rates that ignore the vastly improved claim situation," Bomer said.
"TDI's patience has worn thin, and we're carrying out the responsibility the
Legislature gave us to challenge excessive rates."  An analysis by TDI showed
comp rates were too high by 4 to 17 percent.

HMO controls costs despite difficult market.  


Foundation Health Corp.  plans to stay healthy even in California's tough
climate.  The health maintenance organization is using physicians in Arizona
and California that actually lose money, but then compensates them by
registering them for shares in Foundation stock.
