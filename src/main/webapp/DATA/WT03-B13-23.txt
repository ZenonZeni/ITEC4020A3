Universal Service, Federal Preemption Are Focus Of NCSL Meeting

     State and local governments should monitor provisions in
pending federal telecommunications legislation that could preempt
their authority over carriers within their jurisdictions, panelists
told the National Conference of State Legislatures  during a
meeting of the group's Assembly on Federal Issues held last month
in Washington.  Speakers also discussed whether definitions of
universal service should embrace "advanced" telecom services,
including Internet access.

     In a hearing held by NCSL's Agriculture and Trade Committee,
Clayton Parker, Director-intergovernmental affairs in the Office of
U.S. Trade Representative, said the U.S. is prepared to "freeze"
state-level telecom regulations at their current level as part of
the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations over
basic telecom services.  

     The offer to freeze state regulation is contingent on U.S.
trading partners' agreeing to liberalize their own markets. 
Meanwhile, the federal government would have to obtain consensus on
the proposal from the states, Mr. Parker said.  He noted that
passage of federal telecom legislation would render the offer moot.

     At a Commerce and Communications Committee hearing, Debra
Berlyn, Executive Director of the National Association of State
Utility Consumer Advocates, told state legislators that "effective
competition will protect ratepayers and offer them more benefits
than regulation" will.  But deregulation without effective
competition is "the worst of all possible worlds" for ratepayers,
she added.  

     State legislators should "look in their own backyards" to find
the "most interesting, innovative" developments in telecom markets,
said Jamie Cooper, Associate Director of the Center for Policy
Alternatives in Washington.  In conjunction with the Benton
Foundation, the center this month is issuing a progress report
detailing what states are doing to develop telecom infrastructure,
promote uses of new technology, and encourage innovation, Ms.
Cooper said.

     Jeffrey A. Chester, Executive Director of the Washington-based
Center for Media Education, said universal service should include
access to personal computers and online services, he said.  

     "Electronic redlining"--the exclusion of low-income areas when
deploying advanced services--is a real concern for CME.  Privacy is
another concern, and it is an issue "that the feds are not going to
deal with," Mr. Chester added.  Scott Cooper,
Manager-telecommunications policy for Intel Corp., said, "People
need more bandwidth than they can get over analog copper wire."

     But Mary Rouleau, Director-state legislation for the American
Association of Retired Persons, urged legislators to look at claims
that investment in network upgrades are "demand-driven."  She
suggested that such upgrades are being made "on spec" and that
ratepayers--who may not want advanced services--will have to pay
for them.  Richard L. Cimerman, Director-state telecommunications
association affairs for the National Cable Television Association,
echoed that concern.  He said proposals to include broadband
offerings in the definition of universal service will amount to a
$78 million "tax" on ratepayers.

     The National Governors' Association wants Congress to ensure
that federal legislation will not affect any state rules on
intraLATA (local access and transport area) toll presubscription
that already are in effect, said Tim Masanz, NGA's Group
Director-economic development and commerce.  He noted that four
states--Arizona, New Jersey, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania--
either recently have acted, or are about to act, on this issue.

     Kevin McCarty, Assistant Executive Director-energy,
transportation, and communications for the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, said the federal legislative debate "has created the idea
that there is something special" about telecom service providers as
occupants of public rights-of-way.  Under the competitive market
model, "we will be retrofitting public thoroughfares" to an extent
never before seen, allowing new market entrants use of those
rights-of-way, he said.  Companies are going to Congress and asking
for the same free use of public rights-of-way that was given to
telcos "a hundred years ago," he added.

     Mary McDermott, Vice President-regulatory affairs for the U.S.
Telephone Association, argued that while competition should replace
regulation as the "paradigm" for the industry, it is important to
ensure universal service.  "In many places competition can ensure
affordable service, but not everywhere," she added.  

     Language in the pending federal legislation should be
clarified to ensure that states retain jurisdiction over intrastate
universal service funds, said Lee Palagyi, an Ohio Public Utilities
Commission staff member representing the views of the National
Association of State Utility Regulators.

     Bob Fogel, Assistant Legislative Director of the National
Association of Counties, said local government representatives are
"pretty close" to an agreement with the wireless industry on zoning
authority for cellular and personal communications service (PCS)
towers.  

     Nicholas W. Allard, Counsel to the Wireless Cable Association
International, suggested that state and local governments
increasingly are viewing telecom service providers as a source of
revenue.  He warned that new taxes can be "duplicative" of existing
ones, saying, "Whenever you hear the phrase 'level the playing
field,' you should hold on to something, because you're about to be
tilted over."

MCI Asks N.Y. PSC for 'Neutral' USF, Wants NYNEX Price Plan Set
Aside

     Attacking NYNEX-New York on two fronts, MCI Telecommunications
Corp. has asked the New York Public Service Commission to
reconsider whether the telephone company needs a universal service
subsidy and has requested that a state court overturn the PSC's
approval of NYNEX's performance-based regulation plan.  MCI
submitted to the PSC data from a universal service cost study it
said showed that NYNEX's residential local exchange revenues are
more than two times the economic costs it incurs to provide basic
local exchange service.

     NYNEX's annual revenues from residential services amount to
$1.6 billion, but its total costs to provide those services equal
$640 million, MCI said.  The study indicated that a "limited"
universal service fund of about $10 million per year "is needed to
allow local competition to develop in the high-cost areas" of
NYNEX's service territory.  MCI asked the PSC to develop a
"competitively neutral mechanism to collect and distribute
universal service subsidies where they are truly needed."

     The universal service cost study "confirms what MCI has long
maintained:  NYNEX overcharges its own customers and long distance
companies, does not need a subsidy to deliver basic local service
at affordable rates, and uses those excessive revenues, in part, to
support its other competitive ventures as well as to realize
excessive profit," said Donna Sorgi, Director-state regulatory and
government affairs for MCI's Eastern Region.

     The study found the average cost of service in New York City
to be $7 per residential customer, while NYNEX receives an average
of $26.85 in revenues per customer, MCI said.  Meanwhile, in some
rural areas--particularly in upstate New York--the cost of service
may be as high as $40 per month, while revenues "may only be around
$16 per month."  Those are areas that "actually need" a universal
service subsidy, MCI said.

     MCI's research undercuts NYNEX's reasoning that "enormous
overcharges for access fees" are needed to provide subsidies for
universal service, MCI argued.  According to a chart released by
MCI, NYNEX's performance-based regulatory plan allows it to charge
5.6 cents per minute for intrastate access to its network, while
its "economic cost" to provide that service is 1 cent per minute
(see chart).  

     In its Dec. 18 filing with the commission, MCI also submitted
the "Benchmark Cost Model" it developed in conjunction with NYNEX,
Sprint Corp., and U S WEST, Inc.  That model was filed in an FCC
proceeding on revising universal service support programs (SLCR,
Oct. 20, 1995).  The model "produces 'benchmark' costs for the
provision of basic telephone service in each census block group
within a state," MCI told the PSC.

     Applying the model to New York yields a statewide average cost
for basic universal service of $12.02 per month, compared with a
nationwide average of $16.71 per month, MCI reported.

     MCI also sought a suspension of "the 'play or pay'
intercarrier compensation rates currently in effect in [NYNEX's]
Tariff No. 914."  It added, "There is no factual basis to support
the commission's arbitrary classification of local exchange
competitors as either 'players' or 'payers,' based upon the
untested and unproven assumption that residential service requires
a subsidy from other services."  MCI asked the commission to reopen
an earlier stage of its proceeding on universal service and the
transition to competitive local exchange markets.

MCI Asks Court To Reject NYNEX Regulatory Plan

     On Dec. 18 MCI asked the New York State Supreme Court (County
of Albany) to set aside portions of the PSC's order in "Track 2" of
its incentive regulation proceeding (case no. 92-C-0665), in which
the PSC had approved NYNEX's performance-based regulatory plan. 
MCI alleged that the commissioners had reached their decision on
the plan "in private session in violation of the Open Meetings
Law."

     MCI also asked the court to set aside those portions of the
commission's "Track 1" order in the same proceeding that allowed
NYNEX to "continue to collect $153.3 million in revenues in excess
of its annual revenue requirement"--the revenue required to recoup
its costs and provide a "reasonable return" to investors.  The PSC
had ordered NYNEX to "set aside" those funds "to be used in
accordance with commission determinations to be made in the future
to fund incentives for [NYNEX] to improve its performance," MCI
told the court.  All but $27 million of the set-aside funds have
been released to NYNEX as service-quality incentive awards, it
added.  The price targets the PSC set for certain services were
"based on a wholly untested and unproven assumption that local
residential service requires a subsidy from those services," MCI
said.

     A NYNEX spokesman said MCI is making "the same tired, old,
muddled argument that is as inaccurate today as it was" two years
ago, when work on NYNEX's performance-based regulation plan began. 
"MCI is simply looking for an access rate reduction that is deeper
than it got under the plan," which took effect in September, he
said.  The plan "strikes a good balance" between competitors,
NYNEX, the state, and consumers, who will see about $2 billion in
local exchange and toll rate reductions over seven years, he added.

Utilities Share Problems of State, Local Agencies in Relocating
from 2 GHz Band

By M.J. Richter

     Like many state and local government agencies, numerous member
companies of UTC (formerly known as the Utilities
Telecommunications Council) are incumbent licensees in the 2
gigahertz microwave band.  Also like state and local government
entities, these investor-owned and publicly owned utilities,
electric cooperatives, municipal utility departments, and natural
gas pipeline companies traditionally have used their 2 GHz
microwave radio systems for their internal operations, rather than
for revenue-producing services.  In a recent interview with SLCR,
UTC staff attorney Thomas Goode explained how the FCC's decision to
reallocate the 2 GHz spectrum to personal communications service
(PCS) operators is affecting many of the association's nearly 2,000
member companies. 

     SLCR:  What does the FCC's decision mean for the day-to-day
operations of UTC member companies, which rely heavily on their 2
GHz microwave radio systems for internal communications?

     Goode:  The microwave systems that they now operate in the 2
GHz bands have not been replaced for some period of time, because
UTC member companies have been waiting for resolution of the status
of this particular band, to see whether it would be reclassified
for use by the PCS licensees.  There's been a lot of uncertainty
about what the rules would be, how long they would have to move
out, whether they'd have to bear the cost themselves.  So there
hasn't been as much activity as there probably normally would have
been concerning the replacement of analog systems with digital
systems.

     There has been some movement from the band, simply to get out
of that [uncertain] situation and get to another band--the 6 GHz
band, for instance.

     There are some that have waited, and now they're in a position
where they are co-primary in the bands, which means they can stay
there forever, at least according to current FCC rules.  But they
have to deal with the issue of involuntary relocation at the hands
of PCS licensees.

     SLCR:  If they're co-primary and therefore can stay forever if
they want to, what if a PCS licensee wants the bands they're on?

     Goode:  Essentially, the way the rules work now, the PCS
licensee can operate on the band to the extent that he does not
interfere with an incumbent licensee.  And they are co-primary with
the incumbent licensee.  Now, if the PCS licensees are unable to
operate without causing interference to an incumbent licensee, or
do not want to deal with the hassle of having to work around the
incumbent system, they can enter into mandatory negotiations--force
the incumbent to come to the table and discuss the relocation
terms.

     If they cannot come to a mutually agreeable resolution or
relocation agreement, the PCS licensees can force the incumbent
out.  They can go to the FCC and request an involuntary relocation
of an incumbent system.  

     If they do that, they have to pay all costs associated with
the relocation; they have to move the incumbent to another band;
they have to make sure that the facilities they give them are
comparable to what the incumbent had in the 2 GHz bands; they have
to guarantee that the replacement is seamless, that this whole
transition process out of the 2 GHz band does not disrupt the
incumbent's. . .communications.

     SLCR:  To date, have any UTC members that are incumbent
licensees of that spectrum successfully negotiated their relocation
with PCS providers?

     Goode:  Yes, a number have.  [The negotiated terms and
conditions] are subject in most cases to a nondisclosure agreement. 
I could definitely say, however, that a number of successful
negotiations have occurred--and are occurring right now.  Not only
have they done it but, from what we've heard from the industry,
both sides have been very happy with what they've gotten out of
some of these agreements.

     SLCR:  Are they attempting to negotiate whole-system
changeouts, or are UTC members making piecemeal arrangements with
multiple PCS licensees?

     Goode:  Both.  The answer to that question depends on the
incumbents, what their systems are like and what they're looking
for out of this whole transition process.  Some incumbent systems
are structured such that they cannot tolerate a piecemeal
relocation.  Every time you relocate a single link, you have a
potential for disrupting the entire system.  Some of these systems
are providing such vital communications under. . .such unique
technical constraints that they need to be relocated entirely at
one time, a whole-system changeout.

     Others are looking simply to relocate certain links, and their
systems either are more robust or they're able to somehow engineer
around [any problems].  I know that both [types of relocation] are
happening.

     SLCR:  What do UTC members think of the FCC's proposed
$400,000 cap on the recovery by PCS licensees of the costs they
incur in relocating incumbent users, e.g., UTC members?

     Goode:  Our members are very concerned about this $400,000 cap
because the incumbent microwave systems are unique.  There is no
easy way to quantify how much it would take to move a [given]
system.   Without analyzing each individual system, the costs are
going to vary greatly from one system to another. . .

     When you put a cap on reimbursement costs, even though it
doesn't directly affect how much money can be paid to an incumbent-
-because the cap is only on what the PCS provider can seek from
other PCS providers--there is going to be a fairly direct causal
relationship between that cap and how much a licensee will pay to
relocate a link.  [PCS licensees] will be cognizant of the fact
that they only get reimbursed up to a certain amount, and they're
going to be pushing to keep the amount of money that they pay under
that.

     SLCR:  How are incumbent UTC licensees determining the
market-based value of their microwave operations?

     Goode:  I think the main focus has not been on the fair-market
value, as much as on the replacement value.  Basically, when
incumbents are in negotiations with a PCS provider, they're looking
at two different elements of the costs--or the value--of the
replacement.  One, they're looking at the replacement facilities: 
Where do they need to go?  What will that facility look like?  What
are the costs associated with moving, for instance, from a 2 GHz
system to a 6 GHz system--hardware, software, labor charges, all
the elements that are built into the replacement?  The other
element is the value [or price] that a PCS licensee is willing to
pay to get up and running more quickly than it otherwise might. 
And that is something that requires an analysis of what the value
of time is to a PCS licensee.

     SLCR:  At this point in the negotiation/relocation process, do
UTC members believe the FCC's two-year transition period for
"voluntary negotiations" is long enough?

     Goode:  I would guess that most members are happy with that
period, because they are guaranteed a one-year mandatory period, so
they can negotiate after that.  This voluntary negotiation period
gives them a time to prepare for this negotiation, to do the
studies and whatnot, to be in a position that when they are
required--if they ever are required to negotiate during the
mandatory period--they will have the necessary information.

     This two-year voluntary period is fixed, and the mandatory
period is not.  The mandatory period is a one-year period, but it
doesn't start until the incumbent receives a written notification
from the PCS licensee that they want to negotiate.  

     SLCR:  Do UTC members believe that voluntary negotiations
between the PCS industry and incumbent 2 GHz users will be
successful, or do they think the FCC will have "to impose" some
relocation agreements?

     Goode:  I think most members have very positive feelings that
they will be successful in negotiating a relocation agreement and
that they will reach a voluntary agreement without having to be
forced out of the band.  

     There's a lot of optimism that if a reasonable offer is made,
they can and will try not only to meet the needs/wishes of the PCS
licensee in relocating from the band, but also to offer other
services, such as certain infrastructure--dark fiber, cell sites,
other types of services that will further the PCS deployment.  I
think there's a lot of optimism among our members that it will end
up being a win-win situation for both parties.

APC, Maryland Agency Face PCS Interference Questions

     American Personal Communications has rejected claims that its
personal communications service (PCS) system is interfering with
the operation of Baltimore's mass transit system.  In a recent
letter to APC, Maryland's Mass Transit Administration (MTA) stated
that the new wireless service has caused "serious interference" to
the communications operations of light rail and bus services
operating between Baltimore and nearby destinations.  

     The letter was made public by UTC, the Telecommunications
Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group representing
incumbent microwave radio licensees operating in the 2 gigahertz
spectrum band.  UTC subsequently issued a statement saying it had
distributed the letter without the MTA's consent.

     Anne Schelle, APC's Vice President-external affairs, expressed
concern over what she termed an attempt by UTC to "politicize" the
effort to relocate 2 GHz microwave systems to other spectrum bands. 
The FCC recently clarified rules governing relocation efforts,
further defining "good faith" negotiations between licensees.

     The letter from Maryland's MTA described two occasions last
fall when APC's PCS system disrupted Baltimore's mass transit
communications systems.  "These communications interruptions have
posed a grave threat to public safety," the Dec. 27 letter stated. 
The MTA also asked APC for reimbursement for all costs incurred as
a result of the interference problems.  MTA spokesman Anthony Brown
declined to comment further on the interference problems, noting
that it involves "a possible issue of litigation."

     Ms. Schelle told SLCR that interference problems with the mass
transit system have been resolved.  In a Jan. 3 letter to the MTA,
an APC attorney said mass transit engineers have reported no
public-safety problems resulting from interference between the two
radio systems.  Also, 2 GHz incumbents have a responsibility to
respond to frequency coordination notices in a timely manner, the
attorney added.  The MTA received at least six such letters
indicating that APC planned to test its PCS system, he said, but
MTA officials failed to respond to a single one.

     "Microwave licensees that ignore frequency coordination
notices do so at their own peril," the APC attorney stated.  "PCS
licensees can only protect licensed facilities if they are informed
of the complete parameters of those facilities' operations.  APC
fully protected the facilities represented on MTA's FCC license and
could not have known, without being informed by MTA, that MTA is
operating at a variance from those parameters."

Cable TV Interests Sue Chicago Over 7% 'Amusement Tax'

     The cable TV industry has followed through on threats to sue
Chicago over a 7% "amusement tax" to be applied to the gross
receipts of companies offering video services and certain forms of
live entertainment (SLCR, Dec. 1, 1995).  As previously reported,
the Chicago City Council adopted an ordinance imposing the tax
effective Jan. 1.  Cable TV companies oppose the amusement tax
because they already pay local franchise fees, and satellite TV
operators oppose it because they have no "local" facilities. 
Companies in both industries fear that other cities may impose
similar taxes.

     Communications and Cable of Chicago, Inc., LaSalle
Telecommunications, Inc., and South Chicago Cable, Inc.
(collectively Chicago Cable TV) and the Cable Television and
Communications Association of Illinois have filed a joint lawsuit
(case no. 95CH0011919) against the city of Chicago in the Circuit
Court of Cook County, Ill.  In a memorandum supporting their
"motion for preliminary injunction," the plaintiffs argued that the
newly adopted amusement tax "singles out" cable TV operators and
other providers of electronically delivered programming.  But they
noted that it does not tax "the broadcast television industry and
other members of the press and print media that deliver" similar
programming to Chicago residents.

     Seeking a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, they
said application of the amusement tax "upon selected modes of
speech violates the equal protection clauses of the United States
and Illinois constitutions, as well as the First Amendment rights
of [the] plaintiffs and their subscribers."  In a statement, they
expressed concern that imposing a tax on the estimated 33% of
Chicago residents who subscribe to cable TV service "places a
disproportionate and unfair burden on them to fund services that
benefit the city's entire population."  They recommended that
Chicago undertake further research on the issue before establishing
tax precedents "that potentially could cover everything from online
computer services to home shopping to hotel movie systems."

Pennsylvania Cable TV-Led Coalition's FiberSpan Concept Hasn't Been
Realized

By Judith Freeman Mills

     A year after a communications industry coalition--dominated by
cable TV concerns--acquired the rights to the FiberSpan
Pennsylvania broadband infrastructure concept from the Pennsylvania
Cable TV Association, the project seems all but dead.  The plan to
offer an array of  21st century telecom services in Pennsylvania by
interconnecting the state's cable TV systems "is not going forward
as originally planned," said Hal Estelle, FiberSpan's former Chief
Operating Officer and now a consultant to the project.  Although
the concept is changing, it "still exists," he emphasized.

     The FiberSpan project was created by the state cable TV
association in response to proposals--including legislative
initiatives--for a statewide, fiber optic distance-learning and
telemedicine network.  The proposed legislation would have mandated
telephone company investments in such a network.  The telcos
estimated it would cost them $20 billion to $30 billion to build
the network.  [Legislation was passed in 1993 that allows the
state's telcos to adopt alternative regulation if they submit plans
to the Public Utility Commission for implementing a broadband
network by the year 2015.--Ed.]

     The original goal for FiberSpan was to link all cable headends
in Pennsylvania using fiber optic cables, augmented as needed with
microwave, satellite, and coaxial connections to ensure universal
access to the infrastructure.  The network would offer broadband
delivery of two-way video, data, and voice communications to
government buildings, schools, businesses, medical facilities, and
homes.  But the idea, seemingly simple in concept and technology,
proved more complicated when it came to economics and politics.

     After conducting research and development for the FiberSpan
concept, the state cable TV association sold its idea on Jan. 3,
1995, to the industry coalition, which includes a few phone
companies and energy utilities, as well as cable TV companies. 
FiberSpan Pennsylvania was transformed into a for-profit
corporation.  Jones Lightwave, a competitive access provider and
subsidiary of multiple system operator (MSO) Jones International
Ltd., was one of about 20 major equity investors.  Lightwave
President Wallace Griffen served as Chairman of the FiberSpan
board.

     Earlier this year a contract was drafted--but never signed--
for Jones Lightwave to build and manage the FiberSpan project.  For
the past several months FiberSpan officials have said a final
contract would be issued soon.  But last week they made no such
pronouncement.  While Mr. Estelle said the parties were discussing
a modified version of the FiberSpan Pennsylvania idea, other
project officials were more blunt, saying the idea would never
become a reality.

     "We are looking toward a possibility [that] FiberSpan will
play a role" in the infrastructure of Pennsylvania, Mr. Estelle
said.  "There is still an interest in developing
larger-than-regional infrastructures" and also in serving the
entire state "in some form or fashion."  Talks are continuing
"within the general framework" of the original idea, he continued.

     But he explained that there have been problems getting
FiberSpan's investors to agree on "how to set up the corporation
and the management structure."  In addition, he said, there have
been questions about "the changing nature of competition, changing
attitudes" and, significantly, "individual company plans for their
own regional networks."

     Asked if too many companies are involved in FiberSpan, Mr.
Estelle said, "You can't discount that."  But the number of
participants was not the core problem, he said, adding:  "It would
be more helpful if there was a more defined policy" from the state
government regarding statewide video, telephony, and data
communications.

     William Cologie, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Cable TV
Association, suggested that smaller independent cable operators
felt "a reluctance to relinquish control."  But despite the failure
of FiberSpan's participants to agree on the details of the planned
broadband infrastructure, the idea is still valid, he maintained. 
The idea "makes sense for companies such as Lenfest Communications
and Tele-Communications, Inc., that are rapidly consolidating" and
interconnecting their Pennsylvania operations, he added.  "Why
wouldn't it make sense for the independent operators to jump on,
too, he asked?"

     In the race to wire the state with two-way multimedia-capable
fiber optic lines, the FiberSpan participants still have "a couple
years' head start in terms of infrastructure" compared to Bell
Atlantic-Pennsylvania, the Bell operating company that serves much
of the state, Mr. Cologie said.  The cable TV association is not
considering taking on the FiberSpan effort again, he noted.

     Mr. Griffen said he remains on FiberSpan's board and is "still
hopeful" that an infrastructure based on the FiberSpan concept will
become a reality.  But he noted that cable TV companies, including
Jones, are finding their timetables for launching high-speed data,
telephony, and interactive video services to be more protracted
than originally expected.  The time spent on FiberSpan was not
wasted, because it benefited related projects being undertaken at
Jones, he said.

Regulators, Communications Industry Concerned about Transition
Ahead

By Victoria Mason, Editor of  SLCR's sister publication,
Telecommunications Reports

     Attempts to craft federal legislation reforming the 1934
Communications Act are having dramatic effects on all segments of
the communications industry, even before a bill is signed into law. 
The transition to a new industry structure already is in full
swing, and while the legislation will codify new competitive
principles and regulatory roles, in many respects it may be
outdated from the beginning.

     Instead of driving the current changes shaking the
communications world, activities on Capitol Hill are only
responding to the unique combination of technological, economic,
social, and political forces that have been shaping the industry's
future for some time.  But now, the pace has quickened.

     Participants at a recent conference sponsored by the KMB Video
Journal kept repeating the views of one panelist:  "The current
exercise may be irrelevant--a little bit like rearranging the deck
chairs on the Titanic."  The communications markets are in the
process of reorganizing themselves in fundamental ways.  What
Congress, a regulatory agency, or any company or industry segment
does at this point is likely to influence only the details.

     The legislative developments, however, are focusing greater
public attention on an industry that accounts for a major portion
of the nation's economy and that will have profound effects on how
Americans work and play, become educated, and receive health care
in the 21st century.  And for regulators and business executives,
the congressional debates have served as a "wake-up call":  There's
little time left for the perennial arguments about what the
industry should look like in the future, whether one businesses'
"level playing field" gives it advantages, and how to carve up a
market that is growing exponentially.

     Some regulators and industry executives are acknowledging that
the telecom world is moving in an irreversible direction--with or
without their blessings.  This is creating uneasiness in all
quarters.  Regulators are trying to redefine their roles for the
short term, and many wonder whether they'll have a long-term role. 
Business people are dreading the difficult decisions that come with
corporate reorganizing and downsizing, the never-ending demands for
greater efficiencies, and the industry's push into uncharted
territory.

     In discussions between industry officials and regulators, a
shift is occurring:  The focus is on the stark realities of change-
-the opportunities and problems it brings.  Quickly emerging is a
competitive industry structure in which carrier classifications
will be blurred or eliminated, and market entry and exit barriers
will fall.  Companies that historically have been defined by a
narrow set of products or services--and that have honored
franchises and carefully delineated service territories--are being
turned loose to move in any direction their managers choose.  Bell
companies and independent telcos will compete against each other;
interexchange carriers, competitive access providers, wireless
service providers, and global competitors also will be thrown into
the mix.

     What is being called "regulatory schizophrenia"--having an
announced U.S. policy favoring competition and open market entry,
while simultaneously favoring the preservation of universal service
at all cost--will have to be corrected.  But how?  It's clear that
a new blueprint is urgently needed, but government and business
leaders first must decide what they want the outcome to be.

The Legislation:  What It Does, What It Doesn't Do

     While most observers expect President Clinton to sign
legislation developed by the House-Senate conference committee,
they note that repeated attempts to revise the Communications Act
have failed over the years, often at the last minute.  Each time,
surprised industry lobbyists and Capitol Hill staffers have wailed,
"We were so close, and so much effort went into the process this
time around."

     History proves the Washington adage that it's always easier to
kill a piece of legislation than to get one signed into law.  The
current House and Senate bills, HR 1555 and S 652, are among the
most complex, far-reaching measures to be debated on Capitol Hill
in recent times.  In addition to updating the telephone and
broadcasting sections of the 1934 statute, they address industries
and economic sectors that didn't exist until relatively recently. 
Because the bills tackle so many issues--they "try to do everything
to and for everybody," one lobbyist says--the opportunities for
"mischief-making" are great.

     The direction of the broadly defined "communications industry"
is clear, however, and a massive industry restructuring will
continue to proceed with or without this specific legislation.  If
the current legislative attempt fails, all participants in the
process will be back later--as they have year after year for the
past two decades.

     U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene, who has had the
unenviable task of overseeing the 1982 antitrust consent decree
that bans the Bell companies from interLATA (local access and
transport area) markets and manufacturing, has been awaiting the
outcome of the legislative debate.  

     Several important requests for decree waivers are pending
before him--waivers that would allow local exchange/interexchange
competition experiments.  If communications legislation is not
signed into law, Judge Greene will move on those motions.

     Another "wild card" concerns the Bell companies' 1994 request
that the decree be vacated.  Judge Greene gave the Justice
Department one year to investigate the request, and its
recommendation was expected to be submitted early last September. 
The department's views still are awaited.  Its response is expected
to focus on the current state of competition in communications
markets, possibly fueling the fires on Capitol Hill.

     The current legislative debate, which has been more visible in
the national and local press than have past attempts to rewrite
national telecom policies, has highlighted the trend toward a
competitive model in all segments of communications.  It also has
eradicated age-old concepts about business segmentation and lines
of demarcation (i.e., company X is in the "telephone business,"
company Y is in the "entertainment business," and so on).

     How to define the markets of tomorrow is troublesome for the
Clinton administration, federal legislators, and state regulators. 
Because the bills outline an incremental approach to change that
already is occurring in many jurisdictions, they may be considered
"evolutionary" instead of "revolutionary."  The result will be
greater reliance on market forces and new types of involvement by
regulators.

     Regulators and the financial community have become aware that
even minor tinkering with this industry can have enormous ripple
effects throughout the nation's economy and social structure. 
Indeed, global effects are of concern.  The bills, which spell out
a national policy framework, seek to open communications markets to
more participants and to encourage the deployment of new
technologies and services.

     People involved in all sides of the debate believe that a
rewrite of the nation's communications statute must ensure that all
Americans have access to "new technologies" in addition to basic
telephony.  By the year 2000, 60% of new jobs will require skills
that only 20% of Americans have today.  The Clinton administration
says that, to ensure an adequately trained workforce, educational
institutions and libraries must have adequate access to the
national information infrastructure.

Technology:  Another Complicating Factor

     Overlaid on the political disputes is a shifting technology
scene that promises both solutions and more problems.  The
following technology trends point to major societal changes over
the next 10 years:

     *    Mobility:  People want the flexibility offered by mobile
communications.  This market demand eventually will allow wireless
and wireline services to achieve price and service-quality parity. 
Integrated networks offering seamless services and number
portability will circle the globe.  Separate voice and data lines,
fax lines, mobile phone equipment, and the like will become
unnecessary as single devices provide "integrated messaging."

     *    The Internet:  An increasing number of people pay $15 to
$20 per month for access to the Internet; some of them stay
connected for hours on end, while others have access for short
periods.  As the Internet becomes more popular, traffic congestion
and network crowding will become problems for network planners. 
And capabilities for voice telephony over the Internet will allow
"free" long distance calling, a situation interexchange carriers
can't do anything about.

     The rapid growth of Internet usage raises security issues and
has implications for a variety of transaction services targeted to
both consumers and businesses.  The Internet also will spawn new
"cottage industries," as in-home provision of information and other
services becomes lucrative.  Meanwhile, electronic commerce over
the Internet will lead to "disintermediation"--the elimination of
arbitrage or middlemen--in major segments of the economy.  On a
social level, Internet "chat groups" will allow the real-time
sharing of experiences without regard to geography (i.e., "virtual
parties" while a football game is in progress).

     *    Home Entertainment/Video:  This will develop as
asymmetric digital subscriber line technology evolves and broadband
networks are upgraded.  Predictions are that by the year 2005, two
fully robust networks--cable TV and telephony--will be capable of
delivering all types of services to the home.  

     "Intelligent agents" will find the information a consumer
wants, sorting and filtering massive amounts of data available on
numerous networks.  And "virtual reality" technologies will be
simplified for general consumer uses (for real estate shopping,
home decorating, or product testing, for example).  Telcos,
meanwhile, are expected to integrate vertically into the "content"
business.

     *    Deployment Speed:  Faster product life cycles will mean
faster changes in industry structures, business relationships, and
corporate leadership.

     These changes mean that policy-makers cannot continue drawing
those "bright red lines" around services and industry segments. 
Attempts to delineate which companies can get involved in which
services, and whether services are basic/enhanced or
regulated/unregulated will fail.  As LATA boundaries, franchise
areas, and other types of artificial geographic segmentation become
obsolete, rules will be applied to companies irrespective of the
specific technologies they employ.

How Regulators View the Transition

     Communications markets of tomorrow will be cost-driven,
market-driven, technology-driven, and customer-driven.  Although
aspects of the current regulatory system will remain during the
transition, there's a growing acknowledgment that regulation and
competition cannot coexist indefinitely.

     Meanwhile, the "Internet revolution" is causing many observers
to question the relevance of regulation at all, in any form.  What
the Internet and online services enable massive numbers of people
to do on a global basis also has serious implications for state and
national laws and borders.  These developments are external to the
narrowly focused U.S. debate about reorganizing portions of the
domestic communications industry.

     Regulatory agencies have existed for more than 100 years,
however.  During that time policy-makers have observed great
changes in technology and the business environment, emerging each
time with an updated list of responsibilities and a renewed mission
statement.  The changes ahead will be just as profound for
regulators as for the business community.  

     Nevertheless, some regulation is likely to continue as complex
new issues emerge (carrier and network interconnection is surfacing
as the next battlefield).  And states will retain an important role
as laboratories for regulatory and marketplace experiments.

     But regulators are worried.  They fear the political and
social problems that would result if the current disparities in
wealth and education are extended to communications, creating a
society of information "haves" and "have nots."  

     They wonder what is being done for--or to--consumers who don't
care about competitive models and only want affordable basic
telephone service.  Regulators are hoping for creative solutions.

     State regulators disagree about the effects of Communications
Act revision and the role of regulation in the future.  Some view
federal developments positively, believing that consumers, the
economy, and the nation's global competitiveness will benefit if
legislation is enacted.  They note that local exchange competition
initiatives already are forcing states to review how industries are
regulated.  Events in Washington, they say, are only formalizing a
process that's well under way.

     Others, however, worry that authority is being taken from
them, that their relationships with consumers and industry
officials and their understanding of local needs are being ignored,
and that federal preemption will disrupt activities progressing in
the states.  They want flexibility to address competition issues in
ways that reflect local conditions.  And, believing that rate
increases are inevitable, they want safeguards against "rate shock"
in areas that currently have extremely low rates.

     While national communications policy reforms definitely are
needed, the pendulum has swung too far toward an "inside the
Beltway" approach, some state representatives say.  Economic
development programs may be at stake:  A state needs the freedom to
adopt policies encouraging businesses to locate within its borders. 
If a state makes the right decisions, it will prosper economically. 
If it makes the wrong decisions, it will suffer the consequences. 
Regulators fear that detailed federal mandates will have a
"leveling" effect, making it difficult for individual state
economic development policies to be carried out.

     In some states, many consumer complaints involve interstate
matters over which the states have no jurisdiction.  Because
consumers generally believe federal authorities are inaccessible
and slow to act, they sometimes feel there has been no resolution
to their problems.  

     This situation has led to a suggestion that state public
service commissions become FCC "field offices" after federal
legislation is enacted.  Under this scenario, states would remain
closely involved at the local level, functioning as the federal
government's eyes and ears and having power to act on the federal
government's behalf.

     Also under review is whether the old common law concept of
"common carriage" can be sustained in a competitive environment. 
Public utilities historically have been viewed as "natural
monopolies," with economies of scope and scale that allowed one
company to serve the public interest more efficiently (cheaper)
than several could.  They provided "essential" services in a
nondiscriminatory fashion, and regulators protected the monopoly
status.  

     Regulators now are wondering if, in a competitive market, it
makes sense to characterize any communications company as a common
carrier.  The obligations imposed on public utilities can be
problematic when new market entrants don't appear to be "essential"
and all market players demand equitable treatment.

     Others believe common carriage concepts will remain because of
the public benefits flowing from them and the privileges enjoyed by
such carriers:  Carrier-customer contracts can be established
cheaply and easily through generic tariffs; common carriers have
easy access to public rights-of-way; and they have advantages when
legal liabilities are concerned.

     Regulatory roles and tools already are being revised to
address new demands, and further changes are ahead.  Regulators and
legislators must ensure that "quick fixes" so common during
transitions aren't relied upon long term.  "Sunset" provisions,
therefore, may be necessary to signal to all parties that the
search for permanent solutions should continue.

     Regulation historically has been "vertical," concentrating on
the relationship between carriers and their customers.  In the
future it will become more "horizontal," focusing on relationships
between carriers.  

     Instead of overseeing carrier rate bases or prices or
accounting practices, state regulators will be in charge of
certifying carriers and defining their obligations; addressing
local market entry/exit barriers; developing criteria for
"effective competition" in discrete markets; guaranteeing service
quality; making sure carriers adhere to certain technical
standards; guarding against discrimination between customers and
against competitors; protecting proprietary information about
customers; mediating in carrier-carrier and carrier-customer
disputes, which are expected to increase; and addressing consumer
protection issues and complaints.

     Consumer education and protection raise special concerns for
regulators, who are divided on questions concerning their future
role in these areas.  But everyone seems to agree that (1) consumer
education about communications issues has been handled very poorly
in the past, and (2) customer confusion will increase with the
advent of local exchange competition.  Regulators now wonder how
consumers will react if competition causes residential rates to go
up and business rates to drop.  How will the situation be explained
to them?  Who should take the lead in educating consumers about the
new industry structure?  And how are consumers to distinguish
between one company and another, between one service package and
another?

     Along with the choices available in competitive markets comes
consumer responsibility for the outcome.  Some regulators,
therefore, believe consumers should rely on government intervention
only in cases of fraud or other criminal conduct.  But in the
communications industry, shifting to a "let the buyer beware"
mindset may be slow in coming:  The industry structure is complex,
and many consumers are uncomfortable with technology. 
Nevertheless, in the future they may have to send
communications-related complaints to state attorneys general or the
courts.  Regulators, meanwhile, may target more resources to
collecting data that consumers need to make informed decisions
about communications services.

     Negotiated rulemaking and alternative dispute resolution
procedures are being explored widely, and their use in other
industries can be instructive for communications policy-makers. 
Crucial to successful use of these techniques are incentives for
industry participants to resolve differences themselves and firm
signals about the consequences if negotiations fail.  If regulatory
commissions become facilitators and arbitrators, they will need
employees trained in dispute-resolution procedures.

     The highly charged subject of staffing will be difficult for
commissions that in the future seek new types of employees--those
with backgrounds that are new to regulatory agencies (marketing,
for example).  Meanwhile, uncertainties about future regulatory
roles and the staff cutbacks currently being discussed in some
states are creating a serious management problem:  how to keep good
staff members now, and how to attract a new, highly adaptable type
of professional in the future.

Industry's Concerns: Reorganizations and Equities

     Communications industry officials share many of the
regulators' concerns and have several additional ones:

     *    Networks:  Networks must be modernized, and depreciation
rules must be changed to reflect faster write-offs.  Carriers favor
an evolutionary approach to modernization efforts, hoping to get
the maximum benefits from past investments.  And they want to
ensure that new and older networks, portions of which will exist
long into the future, are interoperable.  Telcos are concerned that
if they offer only a transmission pipe in the future, network
robustness and innovation will be lost.  They say that if the
public switched network (PSN) is unbundled and opened to all
service providers, proprietary network "intelligence" eventually
will be moved out of the PSN.  The value-added intelligence that
makes one network superior to another will reside elsewhere.

     *    Speed:  In the computer industry, extremely rapid product
cycles are the norm, and the telecom industry wants to move in that
direction.  The world won't wait for big, ponderous telecom
companies to make systematic decisions as in the past.  A faster
approach will be necessary to keep pace with entrepreneurs, and a
change in the telecom industry's public image also will be needed
(the public doesn't look to the telecom industry for innovation).

     *    Regulation:  Regulators don't allow the "trial and error"
necessary for development of new products and services, and some
companies currently are barred from offering certain services.  The
situation is further complicated by regulatory requirements that an
innovation be ubiquitous throughout a telco's service area.  

     Regulatory rules often handicap incumbents, making their
response to marketplace demands slow, cumbersome, and expensive. 
And regulators haven't been willing to address certain politically
charged issues--e.g., geographic rate deaveraging--that arise in a
competitive environment.

     *    If We Build It, Will They Come?  It's hard to justify two
(or three, if electric utilities are included) networks to the home
today, and consumer demand for new services remains speculative. 
No one knows whether consumers will spend their discretionary
income on communications/entertainment services, or if they'll have
the spare time to use many of the services envisioned.

     *    Convergence:  An extremely complex transition is taking
place.  Instead of the much-ballyhooed industry convergence
predicted earlier, partnerships will develop for the bundling and
branding of services.  Companies (or industry segments) are likely
to have an identity crisis, being unable to define who they are or
what business they're in.  Whoever is first to offer one-stop
shopping in a new market will have tremendous advantages.  But then
there will be a market shakeout and a bloody field of would-be
competitors.

     *    Wall Street:  Explaining the current changes to Wall
Street analysts, institutional investors, and individual
shareholders is difficult, especially when the communications
industry itself has no clear sense of what the future holds. 
Meanwhile, vast amounts of capital are flowing into and out of an
industry that's in transition, and stock values and risk
assessments are being determined by new criteria.  Dislocations and
confusion are heightened when not only companies but also entire
industries are being reorganized.

IDAHO STAFF, U S WEST AGREE ON SERVICE QUALITY SETTLEMENT

     Under a settlement agreement reached by the Idaho Public
Utilities Commission staff and U S WEST Communications, Inc., the
telephone company could be liable for civil penalties of $7,500 a
month until it reaches and maintains a specified standard for
service quality.  The parties submitted the agreement last month to
the commission for review, and the PUC could consider whether to
accept, modify, or reject it at a meeting slated for this month,
Donald L. Howell II, state Deputy Attorney General, told SLCR.  

     The PUC's current rules do not specify sanctions for the
company if it fails to meet the standard, which calls for resolving
at least 90% of all out-of-service trouble reports within 24 hours. 
Under the agreement, the penalties will be paid into the state's
general fund.

AMERITECH WINS EIGHTH, NINTH CABLE TV FRANCHISES

     Ameritech New Media Enterprises, Inc., is continuing to rack
up local cable TV franchise agreements throughout the Midwest.  The
Ameritech Corp. subsidiary recently won its eighth and ninth
franchises in Southgate, Mich., and Greendale, Wis.  It plans to
invest about $3.5 million to build a two-way interactive cable TV
system in Southgate and $1 million to build a similar system in
Greendale.  Construction on the systems will begin during the next
few months.

     Ameritech New Media previously secured six cable TV franchises
in Michigan (SLCR, Nov. 17, 1995) and one in Glendale Heights, Ill. 
Alleging that Ameritech is cross-subsidizing its cable TV systems
using telephone ratepayer funds, cable TV interests are seeking a
court order blocking further construction in Glendale Heights
(SLCR, Nov. 3 and Dec. 1, 1995).

     Meanwhile, Ameritech New Media has received permission to
begin building cable TV systems in Berea and Columbus, Ohio,
pending the finalization of franchise agreements in those cities. 
Overall, Ameritech New Media is engaged in franchise negotiations
with more than 40 communities in the Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee,
Cleveland, and Columbus areas.

PACIFIC BELL SEEKS APPROVAL TO DOUBLE ISDN RATES

     Pacific Bell has asked the California Public Utilities
Commission for permission to double the per-minute rates for its
integrated services digital network (ISDN) service and to add a
$125 installation fee.  The company said it needs the rate
increase--from 1 cent to 2 cents per minute--because of the
"exploding" demand for service in areas where it is costly to
install and maintain the service.

     ISDN use has until recently been concentrated near central
offices in metropolitan areas, a Pacific Bell spokeswoman said. 
But she said the increase in consumer use of the Internet and
online services--along with increasing popularity of telecommuting-
-has led to more residential installations.  The company's current
ISDN rates will remain in place pending the PUC's decision, which
could take six months or more, she added.

     Avoiding a potential revenue loss of $550,000 a month, U S
WEST Communications, Inc., has converted all Colorado multi-party
lines to single-party service, meeting a Dec. 31 deadline.  The
conversions were required by the Public Utilities Commission's
orders in the second phase of the Rural Facilities Improvement
Program.  The company earlier had sought a waiver from the
requirement, indicating that it did not expect to complete the
conversions last month.

     The PUC had been considering late last year whether to direct
U S WEST to eliminate "tariff riders" which allow the telco to
recover the cost of the conversions.  The rider charges on
subscribers' bills represent $550,000 in monthly revenues, a U S
WEST spokesman told SLCR.  U S WEST said its employees made an
"extraordinary effort" to complete the upgrades by Dec. 31.

TELEMARKETING FRAUD

     Georgia's new Secretary of State, Lewis Massey, has announced
that "attacking telemarketing fraud" will be among his "immediate
priorities."  He said that Georgia consumers lost more than $500
million to telephone fraud. 

     Mr. Massey was sworn into office earlier this month by Gov.
Zell Miller (D.) to succeed Max Cleland.  Mr. Cleland resigned to
run for the U.S. Senate seat held by Sam Nunn (D.), who has
announced he will not seek reelection.
