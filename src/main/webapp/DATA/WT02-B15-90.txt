        Claim Frequency and Severity in 1995</font></h3>
        <p><font color="#800000"><br>
        <i>Robert Jones, Vice President of Claims</i></font> </p>
        <p>TVIR&#146;s Hospital Professional Liability business
        has experienced three consecutive years of declining
        claim frequency. A reliable gauge of claim frequency is a
        comparison of the number of arising cases to an exposure
        base such as bed equivalency. These are numeric values
        given a hospital&#146;s potential exposure areas such as
        acute care beds, clinic visits, bassinets, etc.
        TVIR&#146;s ratio of arising claims per 100 bed
        equivalencies has been on the decline since 1992, and in
        1995 we experienced 1.84 claims per 100 bed
        equivalencies. This nearly equals the five-year low from
        1991 of 1.78 claims per 100 bed equivalencies. </p>
        <p>Indemnity reserves on TVIR&#146;s open HPL claims have
        also experienced a decline in the past five years. Over
        the five-year period, the indemnity reserves have
        decreased 7% while expenses have increased 94%. Indemnity
        reserves represent the dollars set aside to pay
        settlements and verdicts, while the expense reserves pay
        defense lawyers, medical experts, private investigators,
        etc. While the declining indemnity reserve is a favorable
        trend, the expenses are growing significantly. Part of
        this rapid growth in the expense line is due to
        TVIR&#146;s efforts to litigate more cases. For example,
        in 1995 TVIR litigated 49 medical malpractice cases to
        verdict, wining 35, or 71%, of these contests. </p>
        <p>In 1995 TVIR&#146;s average indemnity payment was
        $23,288 while an additional $11,156 was spent in average
        expense payments on a per case basis. Over the past five
        years the indemnity payments on cases closed during that
        period increased 53%, approximately 10% a year. Expenses,
        on the other hand, have increased 88% over the past 5
        years, nearly 18% per year.</p>
