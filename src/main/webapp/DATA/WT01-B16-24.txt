<html><hr><head><h2>OCRWM Receives Half Its Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Request</h2></head>
<p><hr>
  <body><h4>The Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act of 1996 was signed into law on November 13, 1995, providing a total of $400 million for the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM). Of this $400 million, $85 million has been reserved for interim storage and may be used only upon enactment of new statutory authority.  Lacking such authority, the program's fiscal year (FY) 1996 funding is limited to $315 million, half the amount requested last spring by the Administration.
  <p>
The table below outlines the breakdown of funds as follows: the FY 1995 appropriation, the FY 1996 Administration request, and the FY 1996 appropriation.

<p><h4>
As shown in the table, the result of the Congress' budget action is a 50-percent reduction from the FY 1996 request for the program, and a 40-percent reduction from the FY 1995 appropriation expenditure. Based on Congressional guidance,
  OCRWM has allocated $250 million to Yucca Mountain for site characterization activities. At this appropriation funding,
  continuation of the Program Approach adopted in FY 1994 is no longer feasible. The Congress recognized that situation,
  and the Conference Report accompanying the FY 1996 Appropriations Bill provides the following guidance: 
  <p>
"The conferees agree on the importance of continuing the existing scientific work at Yucca Mountain to determine the ultimate feasibility and licensability of the permanent repository at that site. The conferees direct the Department to refocus the repository program on completing the core scientific activities at Yucca Mountain. The Department should complete excavation of the necessary portions of the exploratory tunnel and the scientific tests needed to assess the performance of the repository. It should defer preparation and filing of a license application for the repository with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission until a later date. The Department's goal should be to collect the scientific information needed to determine the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site and to complete a conceptual design for the repository and waste package for later
submission to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission." 
  <p>
OCRWM has defined a new milestone for the Yucca Mountain Project in the form of specific work products that will contribute to a "viability assessment," which will be completed in 1998. This viability assessment is not the same as the technical site suitability evaluation contemplated in the previous Program Approach. 
  <p>
The viability assessment is intended to clarify the most uncertain aspects of geologic disposal at Yucca Mountain. The components of the assessment will make important contributions toward the development of a Secretarial recommendation to the President and preparation of a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), but they will not be sufficient for either of these formal actions.</h4>
  <p>
 <h4><i>Impacts on the OCRWM Program</i></h4>
  <p>
  <h4>The $315 million budget cannot support the following activities: the 1998 target date for the Department to issue
  the Yucca Mountain Technical Site Suitability evaluation; the 2001 target date for a repository license application to
  the NRC; and the 2010 target date for the initial emplacement of spent nuclear fuel in the geologic repository. 
  <p>
  In addition, as a result of budget reductions, the multi-purpose canister (MPC) development program will end
  with the completion of the MPC safety analysis report design (see related article in this issue), and waste acceptance
  activities  will be curtailed to minimum  legal requirements. 
 <p><hr>
 <h3><strong>Yucca Mountain - Planned Activities for FY 1996</strong></h3>
 <h4> Site characterization activities planned for FY 1996 include the following:
<ul>
<li>Complete numerical models of the natural barriers (geology, hydrology, and geochemistry) to support the Total
  System Performance Assessment
 <li>Conduct hydrological testing of the repository rocks and faults in alcoves in the Exploratory Studies Facility 
<li>Monitor the unsaturated zone along the Exploratory Studies Facility main drift
<li>Conduct testing of the saturated zone (ground water)
<li>Continue monitoring of transient events, such as earthquakes and rainfall, at a reduced rate
<li>Issue seismic Topical Report II
<li>Complete excavation of the tunnel's thermal testing alcove
<li>Begin <i>in situ</i> thermal test planning
<li>Provide input to Environmental Protection Agency rule making on the radiation release standard
<li>Develop contingency planning for permanent storage.
</ul></h4>
  <p><hr>
  <h3><strong>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation -   Planned Activities for FY 1996</strong></h3>
  <h4>Activities related to Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation planned for FY 1996 include the following:
<ul>
<li>Submit the Topical Safety Analysis Report to the NRC on the design of the Dry Transfer system, which had been
 developed under a cooperative agreement with Edison Electric Institute
<li>Continue cooperative agreements between the program and external organizations at one-third of their FY 1995 budgets
<li>Develop and issue Section 180(c) Proposed Notice of Policy and Procedures
<li>Perform integrated safeguards and security requirements analysis
<li>Develop spent nuclear fuel verification requirements for utilities
<li>Develop waste acceptance and transportation concept of operations plan
<li>Continue contingency planning for storage, transportation, and operations.
