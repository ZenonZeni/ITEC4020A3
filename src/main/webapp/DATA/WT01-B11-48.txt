<H1> Mid-West Engines:  Background </H1>

<EM> The following information was kindly supplied by Mid-West. </EM>

<P> Mid West Engines Ltd. located at Gloucestershire Airport, Staverton,
near Gloucester, has just confirmed satisfactory completion of the
development of its GAE100R rotary engine for light aircraft. This was
recognized on February 1st, 1996, by the official presentation to the
Company by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of the engine's
Certification to JAR-E for Full Public Transport Category.

<P> The Mid West rotary engine is based on a design conceived by <A HREF
= "dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A> in the 1930's although the first
functional prototype was not completed until the 1950's. Many companies
have investigated the potential of the Wankel rotary engine but only the
Japanese automobile company <A HREF = "mazda.html">Mazda</A> has it in
series production by fitting it to the high-performance <A HREF =
"rx-7.html">RX-7 sports car</A>.

<P> Mid West, attracted by the low vibration / high specific output of
the rotary engine, continued a development programme in 1994 to adapt
the basics of the <A HREF = "norton.html">Norton rotary motorcycle</A>
engine for manned-flight applications.

<P> The <A HREF = "rce.html">rotary engine</A> has only three main
components; the main housing is machined internally to an algebraic
formula conceived by Wankel, referred to as an epitrochoid, and bearing
a resemblance to a fat figure-of-eight. The rotor is triangular in shape
with convex flanks and runs on an eccentric portion of the output
shaft. An internal gear on one end of the rotor engages with a fixed
timing gear on an end housing, ensuring the correct orbital motion of
the rotor. Due to the reduction ratio of this gearing, the rotor spins
at only one third of the speed of the output shaft.

<P> Spring-loaded <A HREF = "seals.html">seals</A> at each of the three
corners of the rotor rub on the surface of the epitrochoid and separate
the individual phases of combustion occurring on each flank of the
rotor. As the rotor sweeps around inside the housing, each flank sees a
varying volume between itself and the housing and creating the
conventional phases of the four-stroke cycle: Induction : Compression :
Expansion : Exhaust.

<P> This sequence of events is occurring on each flank of the rotor and
results in a total of three power impulses for each complete revolution
of the rotor or one power impulse for every complete revolution of the
output shaft. In this respect, power delivery is similar to that of a
two-stroke engine.

<P> In a sequence similar to an axial-flow turbine engine, gases in the
rotary engine flow in one direction only; inducted gases following the
direction of rotor rotation through compression and then expansion to
exhaust. Thus the induction / compression section of the rotor housing
remains relatively cool whereas the expansion / exhaust section is much
hotter and requires careful management of cooling. Early automobile
engines suffered excessive rotor seal wear due in part to differential
expansion caused by this variation distorting the ideal machined
profiles.

<P> New and improved materials are now available, and solutions
developed by MWE using the latest technology have overcome the problems
resulting in a power unit lighter than a conventional reciprocating
engine, giving a long life between overhauls, and of particular interest
for aircraft applications.

<P> An almost unique feature of the Mid West rotary engine is that the
torque curve is flat over a very wide speed range. As horsepower is
effectively torque multiplied by speed, greater speed produces more
power, although as speed increases, internal losses (friction etc.) also
increase. However, the results of speed increases on reciprocating
engines can result in dramatic failures as stress levels multiply. Pure
rotary motion and near perfect dynamic balance of the Mid West engine
ensure that increasing speed does not cause significantly increased
stress levels. In practice, limiting speeds of Mid West engines are
established as a satisfactory balance between power output and an engine
life with a high margin of safety.

<P> Reduction gearboxes fitted as an integral part of Mid West rotary
engines and incorporating torsional dampers, allow the propeller to turn
 relatively slowly. The reduction ratio of the twin-rotor GAE100R unit,
for example, allows the propeller to experience six power impulses per
revolution. That sort of power  from a conventional direct-drive would
require a twelve cylinder four-stroke engine to achieve the same
smoothness of delivery. Similarly the single rotor GAE50R can be equated
to a six cylinder, direct-drive engine. Any vibration which may be felt
from a Mid West engine can almost certainly be attributed to imbalance
in the propeller.

<P> The GAE50R single rotor engine produced by Mid West carries
certification to JAR-22 and is being purchased by Alexander Schleicher
for the ASH 26 powered sailplane; to date, more than 120 units have been
delivered. The engine delivers 50 BHP at 7,500 rpm and is also suitable
for microlights, ultra-lights, etc.

<P> Liquid cooling of the main engine castings, patented forced-air
cooling of the rotor internals, precisely metered oil flow to the
bearings, and a sophisticated high energy duplicated ignition system all
contribute to the quality and reliability of the engines. Mid West,
drawing on experience of many thousands of hours of development testing
and on experience from their customers, are confident that their rotary
engines, designed, developed, and built by a small team at Staverton and
accredited by the CAA, are the best in the market.

<P> Technical specifications are available for two engines: <A HREF =
"mid-west-eng.html#GAE100R"> Type GAE 100 R</A> Certification to JAR - E
and <A HREF = "mid-west-eng.html#AE50R"> Type AE 50 R</A> Certification
to JAR - E.
