Advancing the development and commercialization of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies is the main job of the Golden Field Office, located in Golden, Colorado.  As the primary field agent for <a href="http://www.eren.doe.gov">DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EE)</a>, Golden serves as a catalyst for partnerships between DOE, its laboratories and the private sector.<p>
        
By partnering with small and large industries and universities around the country, Golden helps develop and transfer technologies into the marketplace where they can be used by industry and consumers.<p>
        
The Golden Field Office was established in October 1978 as the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI) Site Office.  Golden was designated a field office in December 1992 to provide EE enhanced capability to develop and commercialize energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.  In an effort to focus EE's resources more effectively, much of EE's work was consolidated at Golden. <p>
        
Golden is also responsible for administering the management and operating contract for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  NREL is the nation's only national laboratory dedicated to furthering the development and commercialization of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies. <p>
        
Activities conducted by Golden and NREL span many scientific and technical areas, including photovoltaics, solar thermal, wind energy, biomass, geothermal and renewable energy resource assessment.
