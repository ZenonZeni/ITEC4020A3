<P>
The student journal entries below have been provided by our SEA
Alums. We hope they give you a feeling for what it's like to be
out there with us.  There are quite a few pictures, so it takes a 
moment to load this page.<P>

<I><B>We are scientists. We are sailors. Our mission is precise. It
is exact. Most of us have been &quot;prepared&quot; on shore for
this voyage and now it is time to execute...—Gus

<B><I>I know now what Cory Cramer meant when he said that </I>Westward<I>
is a forgiving ship.  She laughs when we bumble through an inept
sail change or overwork her rudder.  Her nerves are steady in
spite of the strains we impose upon her vital parts.  She suffers
insults nobly as we chip away her rust and coat her open wounds
with orange paint that soothes our egos as it hides her scars.
 She is patient when we abandon her to tarnished neglect and clutter
her decks with the foul debris of our imprudent assaults on the
sea in the name of research.  And when the sea rises we curse
her violent reactive surges even as we cling, white knuckled,
to whichever part of her we choose to grab for support.  It's
hard to say goodbye to </I>Westward<I>.  She knows me too well and I
owe her too much.—Marion

<I><B>The last three days were incredibly intense, wild, good and bad.
We were the first watch ashore on Plana Cay. The water was an
incredible aquamarine and you could see the green water breaking
on the reef off the beach.—Cindy

We are in the Sargasso Sea where the ocean's productivity is low,
but the Issac Kidd Trawl we hauled in was full of bioluminescent
life.  The trawl looked like a larger than life reflection of
the Milky Way as it glowed in the water just before we pulled
it up.—Marion

<I><B>Another day in paradise. Allan took Becky, Julie, Emma and me snorkling.
We went to the Blue Grotto where the cliff is so there was lots
to see. I spotted a ray and all sorts of fish and coral. It
was windy, so it got a little rough on the way back. We went to
Fort Cay and was the remains of Henry Morgan's cannon placements
and ammunition magazine. Then we went to the wreck and snorkled
there. I collected sand dollars, heart urchins and sea biscuits.—Cindy
