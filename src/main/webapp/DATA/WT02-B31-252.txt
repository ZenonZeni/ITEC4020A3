		Covert Channels in the TCP/IP Protocol Suite</A></font> <br>	
		<I>Craig H. Rowland;  14 November 1996; ASCII Text;  53k</I>
		<a target="reference" href="http://www.psionic.com/papers"><font size=-1>Original & Source Code</font></a><br>
		<font size=-1><br>
		<p>This paper demonstrates several methods of encoding secret data into the
		headers of the TCP/IP protocol. Main topics of interest include:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Encoding data into IP headers.</li>
		<li>Encoding data into TCP headers.</li></ul>

		<p>Specific areas of focus allow encoding of data into the IP
		identification fields and TCP sequence number fields for clandestine
		transmission of data to a remote host. Packets of data appear normal to
		network sniffers and packet filters, yet can contain hidden messages in
		either plaintext or ciphertext.</p>

		<p>Other methods revealed include a new technique where forged packets can
		be "bounced" off any Internet connected site to establish a
		communication path that appears to originate from the "bounced" host. 
		Additionally, several methods are discussed regarding bypassing of
		packet filters with encoded data for communication with hosts inside a
		protected network.</p>

		<p>This paper contains actual demonstrations as well as source code for
		Linux 2.x systems to allow encoded transmissions between sites to be
		tested.</font></td>

		<font size=-1><br>
		The goal of ATM is high-performance wide area connectivity both site to site and
		end-point to end-point.  Moving ATM from the labs and LANs to the MANs and WANs is
		not possible for many because of a lack of data stream policy, audit, commercial
		privacy, data integrity, and authentication within existing ATM switches, end-points
		or network offerings.  This paper describes a device whose intended purpose is to
		add these security features while maintaining the end-to-end high-performance
		nature of ATM and to create the general direction that high-performance network
		security may take in the future.</font></td>

        Improving the Security of Your Site by Breaking Into it</a></font><br>
		<i>Dan Farmer; Sun Microsystems; HTML; 52k</i><br>
		<font size=-1><br>
		Every day, all over the world, computer networks and hosts are being broken into. The
		level of sophistication of these attacks varies widely; while it is generally believed
		that most break-ins succeed due to weak passwords, there are still a large number of
		intrusions that use more advanced techniques to break in. Less is known about the latter
		types of break-ins, because by their very nature they are much harder to detect.

		IP Security, Creating Secure Intranets over the Internet</a></font><br>

		<a target="reference" href="http://www.network.com/~hughes/INET.html"><font size=-1>Original</font></a><br>
		<font size=-1><br>
		The technology to create interoperable secure encrypted tunnels over the internet is now
		possible.  Secure intranets over the internet is an intriguing cost savings solution to
		replace high cost leased lines or frame relay services while at the same time increasing
		the security of that traffic.

		Measuring Firewall Performance</a></font><br>
		<i>Andrew Molitor; Network Systems Corporation; HTML</i><br>
		<font size=-1><br>
		In this paper, we develop some terminology to describe performance measurements, and
		develop an experiment to compare packet filtering against a proxy approach. The single
		limited case of FTP transactions is our primary focus. The results suggest that the
		maximum rate at which FTP sessions can be set up and torn down is unaffected by packet
		filtering, but approximately halved by a proxy. The bulk data transfer throughput
		is a little worse than halved by the packet filter used, and cut to one-fifth by the
		proxy used. Thus, it appears that proxies to perform substantially worse than packet
		filters. However, the actual results also suggest that with reasonably available fast
		hardware, throughputs quite close to wire rate, at least for the tests conducted, would
		be perfectly possible with either approach.</td>

	This is a writeup on a security survey of approximately 2200 computing systems on
  the Internet that I did in November-December of 1996. I performed
  the survey out of curiosity, but I'm writing this report in an attempt to disseminate my
  rather startling and depressing results.
