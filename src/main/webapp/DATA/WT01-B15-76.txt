I remain bullish on Canadian markets but, presently, we don't have the powerful market influence of the natural resources sectors to boost prices. Also, the TSE 300 chart shows that the market is at the top of the multi-year trading channel, which tends to put a brake on any rapidly accelerating rally. More likely action calls for the TSE 300 to climb the trendline for a while, especially if the US markets continue with their recent powerful rally. That's not necessarily a negative. It may give us time to ponder the market action over the next few months, rather than overreacting to it.<p>For yet another month, Canadian markets are doing well on the international stage. On a month over month basis, my 50 international indices and sub indices are led by Canadian groups. TSE Transports (thanks to Laidlaw) lead followed by very strong action by the TSE Consumer Prods. Index, mostly because of funeral home takeover candidate Loewen Group. I said it fifteen years ago and, unfortunately for you, I'll say it again. Funeral homes are a good long term investment. Just buy 'em when nobody wants them, that's all. We'll all die, someday. This is a smart way to follow demographer David Foot's (of "Boom Bust and Echo") advice, but just wait until everybody else forgets about demographics. The TSE Financial/Banking index is next. Canadian banks are <i>hot, </i>but getting overdone. The Real Estate Index and the<i> </i>Merchandising Index followed, with the TSE Oil and Gas and TSE Utilities a little behind.<p>The Canadian markets seem hot. Of the twelve international indices in the top quartile ranking eight are Canadian! However the Canadian markets appear to be segmented. There is lots of action only if you are in the right Canadian sectors. Despite the hot dog performance of nearly half of the Canadian sectors, the TSE 300 Index can only score in the middle of the pack. True to form, some Canadian groups also are the significant worst performers this month. Although results were only marginally negative, the natural resources groups (excluding the Oil index) were at the bottom of the list. Natural resources are still in a strong intermediate term uptrend but showing weakness on the shorter term. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/tse300.gif">TSE 300<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="natres.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>191</center></body></html>
