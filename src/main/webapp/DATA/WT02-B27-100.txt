Mathematics with Technology</H2>

Few will argue with the fact that technology is beginning to permeate almost every aspect of today's society.  In classrooms, graphing calculators and computer software are providing tools for students to explore mathematical ideas in such a way that would be tedious if not impossible using paper-and-pencil techniques.  The following excerpts are included to illustrate the common view regarding the importance of technology held by many mathematical organizations.
<DL>
<DD> We believe that:
<UL>
<LI> appropriate calculators should be available to all students at all times;
<LI> a computer should be available in every classroom for demonstration purposes;
<LI> every student should have access to a computer for individual and group work;
<LI> students should learn to use the computer as a tool for processing information and performing calculations to investigate and solve problems. (NCTM, 1989, p. 8)
</UL>
<BR>
<DD> Students will use appropriate technology to enhance their 	mathematical thinking and understanding and to solve 	mathematical problems and judge the reasonableness of their 	results.  (AMATYC, p. 11)<BR>
<BR>
<DD> Children should use calculators throughout their school work, 	just as adults use calculators throughout their lives.  More 	important, children must learn when to use them and when 	not to do so.  (NRC, 1989, p. 47)<BR>
<BR>
<DD> Unless undergraduate mathematics courses are revised to 	reflect the impact of computers on the practice of 	mathematics, students will continue to perceive mathematics 	as a discipline disconnected from reality. (NRC, 1991, p. 25)
</DL>
This provides pretty clear evidence of the importance of using technology in the teaching and learning of mathematics. However, it is important to note that the emphasis is on the <I>appropriate</I> use of technology by students.
