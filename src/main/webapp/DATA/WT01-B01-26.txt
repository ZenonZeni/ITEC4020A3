International Court of Justice<br>
Communique<br>
unofficial<br>
for immediate release
<p>

No. 96/23<br>
8 July 1996
<p>
<b>LEGALITY OF THE TREAT OR USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS (REQUEST FOR 
ADVISORY OPINION BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED 
NATIONS)</b>
<p>
<b>ADVISORY OPINION</b>
<p>
The Hague, 8 July 1996.  The International Court of Justice today 
handed down its Advisory Opinion on the request made by the General 
Assembly of the United Nations in the above case.  
<p>
The final paragraph of the Opinion reads as follows:
<p>
For these reasons,
<p>
<b>THE COURT</b>
<p>
(1) By thirteen votes to one,
<p>
<b>DECIDES</b> to comply with the request for an advisory opinion;
<p>
<b>IN FAVOUR:</b> PRESIDENT Bedjaoui; VICE-PRESIDENT Schwebej, JUDGES 
Guillaume, Shahabuddeen, Weeramantry, Ranjeva, Herczegh, Shi, 
Fleischhauer, Koroma, Vereshchetin, Ferrari Bravo, Higgins;
<p>
<b>AGAINST:</b> JUDGE Oda
<p>
(2) REPLIES in the following manner to the question put by the General 
Assembly:
<p>
A Unanimously,
<p>
There is in neither customary nor conventional international law any 
specific authorisation of the threat or use of nuclear weapons;
<p>
B. By eleven votes to three,
<p>
There is in neither customary nor conventional international law any 
comprehensive and universal prohibition of the threat or use of nuclear 
weapons as such;
<p>
<b>IN FAVOUR:</b> PRESIDENT Bedjaoui; VICE-PRESIDENT Schwebel; JUDGES 
Oda, Guillaume, Ranjeva, Herczegh, Shi, Fleischhauer, Vereshchetin, 
Ferrari Bravo, Higgins;
<p>
<b>AGAINST:</b> JUDGES Shahabuddeen, Veeramantry, Koroma
<p>
C. Unanimously,
<p>
A threat or use of force by means of nuclear weapons that is contrary to 
Article 2, paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter and that fails to 
meet all the requirements of Article 51 is unlawful;
<p>
D. Unanimously,
<p>
A threat or use of nuclear weapons should also be compatible with the 
requirements of the international law applicable in armed conflict 
particularly those of the principles and rules of international 
humanitarian law, as well as with specific obligations under treaties and 
other undertakings which expressly deal with nuclear weapons;
<p>
E. By seven votes to seven,
<p>
It follows from the above-mentioned requirements that the threat or 
use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of 
international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the 
principles and rules of humanitarian law;
<p>
However, in view of the current state of International Law, and of the 
elements of fact at its disposal, the Court cannot conclude definitively 
whether the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be lawful or 
unlawful in an extreme circumstance of self-defence, in which the very 
survival of a State would be a stake; 
<p>
<b>IN FAVOUR:</b> PRESIDENT Bedjaoui, JUDGES: Renjeva, Herczegh, Shi, 
Fleischhauer, Vereschetin, Ferrari Bravo;
<p>
<b>AGAINST:</b> VICE-PRESIDENT Schwebel; JUDGES: Oda. Guillaume, 
Shahabuddeen, Weeramantry, Koroma Higgins.
<p>
F.  Unanimously,
<p>
There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a 
conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects 
under strict and effective international controlS.
<p>
The Court was composed as follows: PRESIDENT Bedjaoui, VICE-
PRESIDENT Schwebel; JUDGES Oda, Guillaume, Shahabuddeen, 
Weeramantry, Ranjeva, Herczegh, Shi, Fleischauer, Koroma, 
Vereshchetin, Ferrari Bravo, Higgins: REGISTRAR Valencia-Ospina.
<p>
PRESIDENT Bedjaoui, JUDGES Herczegh, Shi, Vereshchetin and Ferrari 
Bravo appended declarations to the Advisory Opinion of the Court; 
JUDGES Guillaume, Ranjeva and Fleischhauer, Koroma and Higgins 
appended dissenting opinions.
<p>
(A brief summary of the declarations and of the opinions may be found 
in the annex to this Press Communique.)
<p>

Congratulations to the millions internationally who signed a declaration
of public conscience and submitted it to the the World Court.
<p>
We have been heard.
<p>
Congratulations to the dedicated team on the World Court Project
Steering Committee Internationally.  Your work, particularly in
encouraging the Non Aligned Movement to take the question to the
UN General Assembly is historic.
<p>
Congratulations to New Zealand Magistrate Harold Evans (retd) for your
initiation of this project and the work you have persisted in with it
for over a decade.
<p>
This is a strong endorsement for the international work of Non
Governmental Organisations.  Three NGOs cooperated to promote Nations
supporting the World Court Project.   IALANA (International Association
of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms), IPPNW (Internation Physicians for the
Prevention of Nuclear War), and IPB (International Peace Bureau).
Citizen involvement in international NGO work has here had impact
at the highest level of international opinion making inspite of
concerted opposition from the United States, United Kingdom, France
and Russia.
