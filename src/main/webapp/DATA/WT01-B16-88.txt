The Nuclear Programme and Public Acceptance in Korea. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/kookbio.html">Yang Chang Kook</A> and Cho Byung Oke.</H3>

<P>
Korea's total nuclear capacity in June 1995 was 8616 MWe, with 10 operating units representing 27.1% of
 Korea's total generating capacity and 35.5% of total power generation in 1994. Operating performance
 of plants has improved with  average annual 
capacity factor exceeding 80% for the last four years. Six units are under construction and seven more
 will be on line by 2006, which will give a total nuclear generation capacity of over 20 000 MWe, from
 23 plants, representing 37.7% of total generating capacity.

<P>
Korea aims at energy independence, and towards this end KEPCO is establishing a self-reliance programme 
for nuclear plant construction and operation in three phases: firstly ordering NPPs on a turnkey basis;
 secondly contracting foreign companies for NPP construction; and thirdly contracting Korean companies. 
Phase Three is now in progress with construction of  Yonggwang 3 and 4. KEPCO has also developed a 
standard NPP design ( a 1000 MWe class PWR), which was used for Ulchin units 3 and 4.

<P>
Economic and social development has brought growing environmental concern, much of it antinuclear,
 necessitating special public acceptance programmes for nuclear projects. These include KEPCO's 
 'open information' policy plus specific PA activities undertaken by each nuclear plant and enterprise;
 the law providing support for communities surrounding power plants, which KEPCO supports and finances; 
the establishment of the Organisation for Korea Atomic Energy Awareness in 1992, an independent non-profit 
organisation which carries out nuclear PA programmes through information disclosure, public education, 
support of pro-nuclear organisations, opinion surveys, and particularly through school education; and
 finally the building of exhibition centres at nuclear power stations - the one at Ulchin has already 
received two million visitors, and one is planned for Seoul which is expected to prove very influential.

<P>
Public opinion surveys, conducted regularly since 1986, reveal that though the majority of the
 population considers nuclear the main energy source for the future, they are wary because of
 fear of radiation; that people get most of their nuclear information from the mass media; that they 
distrust nuclear information from this source, preferring to believe scientists; and that chief public
 concerns are with radiation. It is therefore concluded that the best channel for nuclear PA would be
 television broadcasts by scientists on topics concerning radiation. Surveys will continue to be performed
 and PA strategy modified where necessary.

<P>
Korea plans to join the OECD in 1996 and must meet its Framework Convention on Climate Change, keeping
 greenhouse gas emissions acceptably low. Nuclear is her logical energy choice; support for this choice is in
 general high.
