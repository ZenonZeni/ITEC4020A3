AVIONICS OUTLOOK BODES WELL DESPITE DEFENSE CUTS

      Although the production rates for most U.S. military
aircraft programs will continue to be pared down in 1990, the
Commerce Department predicts the U.S. aerospace equipment market
will continue trending upward through the new year.  In the 1990
edition of the agency's U.S. Industrial Outlook, Commerce
Department experts predict the value of aerospace product
shipments will climb from $105.7 billion in 1989 to $114.2
billion in 1990.  That represents a gain of 3.8 percent after
adjusting for inflation.
      The report, which looks at very large segments of the
aerospace industry, gives avionics providers an idea of which
segments to target by pointing out where the greatest share of
growth will take place.  According to the report:
     Large jet aircraft production "will drive industry growth in
1990." Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are expected to deliver 512
transport aircraft in the new year.  That is the largest number
shipped since 1968.
     Demand for general aviation airplanes and helicopters is
expected to increase in 1990.  Shipments of U.S. general aviation
airplanes should pass the $2 billion mark for the first time
since 1981.
     U.S. manufacturers will pare down production rates on most
military aircraft programs in 1990.  The U.S. government will
take fewer deliveries from all fighter programs.  On a more
positive note, McDonnell Douglas is slated to deliver its first
C-17 transport aircraft in late 1990.  Also, the government is
expected to make the contract award in 1990 for 211 off-the-shelf
business jet aircraft for the Tanker-Transport Trainer System
(TTTS).  If the contract is indeed awarded, it will be the
largest single business jet buy in history.
     U.S. shipments of missiles, space vehicles, and related
products are forecast to grow more than 3 percent in 1990.
Increasing production of U.S. expendable launch vehicles will
pace the expansion.
     U.S. aerospace trade will rise to a record high in 1990.
Projected exports of $33.1 billion and imports of $11.3 billion
will yield a trade surplus of $21.8 billion, up 12 percent from
the estimated 1989 surplus.

Cautious Optimism Tone For Long-Term Outlook

      As is the case the immediate future, the report also
indicates that civil aerospace programs will be the focus through
the new decade.  Civil aircraft production will account for 54
percent of total aircraft shipments through the year 2000.  The
Boeing Co., the Commerce Department noted, forecasts world demand
for 8,417 large transport aircraft valued at $516 million by the
year 2005.

AIA SEES RECORD AVIONICS SALES FOR 1990

      Sales of aerospace products, including avionics, will reach
record levels in 1990, fueled by sales of new civil aircraft and
modernization of older military airframes, according to the year-
end forecast of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA).
      Total sales for 1990 are expected to reach $137.4 billion,
representing a 14 percent gain for the industry, AIA said.
Profits for 1989, however, declined from $4.9 billion to a
preliminary estimate of $4.3 billion.
      The civil aircraft sector will be supported by a record
backlog and increased demand for transport aircraft by the
world's airlines.  That sector's sales will surge from $20.1
billion in 1989 to a projected $32 billion this year.  Sales
activity in the military aircraft sector will also rise slightly
in 1990, but will decline in real terms from 1989's figure of $42
billion as a result of continued cutbacks in defense spending,
AIA said.
      Despite the projected growth in sales, AIA pointed out that
spending for military aircraft, a category of aerospace business
which has recorded strong growth throughout the 1980s, is
projected to have declined in 1989 by 4 percent after adjustment
for inflation.  Total sales to the U.S. government, primarily the
Pentagon, are expected to have risen 4.3 percent in 1989 to $72.2
billion.  Washington is the largest single customer for aerospace
products.

But EIS Predicts Flat Defense Electronics Sales

      Meanwhile, another industry group is predicting flat or
declining sales for defense electronics components.  Sales of
defense electronics products will "remain at or slightly below"
levels reached in 1989, the Electronic Industries Association
(EIA) said.  The trade group estimated defense electronics sales
for 1989 totaled $55 billion.

SIMULATION/ELECTRONICS SEEN WEATHERING BUDGET STORM

      While future defense budgets are expected to fall, some
financial analysts and industry officials are predicting that the
simulation and electronics industries will be relatively
untouched by cuts in Pentagon spending and may even grow.
      According to Dr. Malcolm Currie, chairman and CEO of Hughes
Aircraft Co., new military tools that are being shaped by
emerging technologies will require new levels of training, new
skills and new education to be used effectively.  These new high-
technology tools offer "tremendous opportunity for a growth
industry" in simulation and training, says Currie.
      "Today we face reduced defense budgets, diminished
resources, and reduced force levels.  We have the continuing pace
of technology and the complexity of equipment to deal with,"
according to Currie.
      Wolfgang Demische, a well-respected analyst with UBS
Securities Inc., said if current budgetary trends continue for
several years "the simulation and training [business] might look
somewhat better" than weapons development.  GM Hughes, Raytheon
and Loral are positioned well for these opportunities, Demische
said in an interview with AVIONICS REPORT.
      An "emphasis on upgrading existing platforms" with force-
enhancing electronics will become attractive to a fiscally
conservative Pentagon and Congress, and as a result, advanced
electronic and composite material industries are good places to
invest, Byron Callon, an aerospace/defense analyst for Prudential
Bache, told AVIONICS REPORT.
      Charles Gabriel, senior vice president of the Washington
Research Group, affiliated with Credit Lyonnaise, believes the
industry will become "leaner, meaner, more qualitative."
      Some analysts, Paine Webber for example, feel defense
electronics stocks should generally be avoided.
      Surveillance, arms control verification, and avionics
upgrades will not be significant growth areas in the future,
according to Paine Webber analysts.
      The brokerage firm is telling customers who are still hungry
for defense electronics stocks to consider buying in June 1990
since Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will be in the United
States and talk of arms control treaties could increase the value
of defense electronics stocks.

DAB FOR MIDS EXPECTED IN FEBRUARY;OSD TO RECOMMEND MIDSCO

      Officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)
will recommend that the international consortium, MIDSCO Inc., be
awarded a sole-source, firm-fixed-priced, full-scale development
(FSD) contract for NATO's Multifunctional Information
Distribution System (MIDS), Pentagon sources tell AVIONICS
REPORT.
      The recommendation will be made next month at a meeting of
the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB).  The program is expected to
be worth as much as $5 billion to participating companies over
the next 20 years.
      OSD will recommend that MIDSCO get the contract in order to
allay European concerns, sources said.  European firms make up
the bulk of the MIDSCO consortium, which is headquartered in
Delaware.
      A Navy official close to the MIDS program said that the
international concerns are very important because all the
nations' monies are needed to keep the program alive.
       The MIDSCO group is composed of Plessey Electronics Systems
Corp. (U.S.), Thomson-CSF (France), Siemens (Germany), Italtel
(Italy) and Inisel (Spain).  The Navy official said the U.S. is
contributing about 40 percent of the funds for the program and
the Europeans are putting up the balance.
      But others said since there are no "purely owned" U.S.
companies in the MIDSCO group, it will be difficult for the
consortium to get the contract.  Plessey U.S. is part of the
British-based firm which was recently bought out by GEC of
Britain and Germany's Siemens (AR, Sept. 22, 1989, p. 1).

Hughes Wants Role

      Officials at Hughes Aircraft Co. are irritated by reports
that MIDSCO will get the MIDS development contract.  The firm
fired off a letter last August saying it had not been given a
fair chance to participate in the FSD phase of the MIDS program
and requested that the Defense Department reconsider OSD's
position on the FSD contract award.  Hughes officials tell
AVIONICS REPORT that if MIDSCO is awarded the contract, the U.S.
will be sending its money overseas.  A Hughes official also said
that his firm's substantial effort on the Joint Tactical
Information Distribution System (JTIDS), which MIDS will be based
on, qualifies it for consideration for the FSD award.
      A Pentagon source said that in a reply letter to Hughes, OSD
said "We will take your (Hughes') concerns through the
acquisition process and keep you advised along the way."  He
added that while MIDSCO will be recommended for the FSD contract,
there is no guarantee that the DAB will agree and said that the
process is "rigorous and very democratic."
      A Pentagon official made it clear that the full-scale
production phase of the MIDS program will be competitive.

Joint Venture Possible

      Indeed, he mentioned it is possible that some sort of joint
venture for MIDS may be decided on at the DAB.  An Air Force
source confirmed that a lot of talk about a joint venture had
occurred.  Others noted a joint venture would force the Pentagon
to change some of the original ground rules in the MIDS program
which basically called for MIDS to go sole-source to MIDSCO.
      However, an Air Force source pointed out that the idea of a
joint venture has not "really been thought about in the
international environment" and added that "everything has been
negotiated to date within the current MIDSCO structure."
      The Air Force source also disclosed that since it is an
international program, MIDS was originally going to bypass the
conventional U.S. acquisition process.  But John Betti, under
secretary of defense/acquisition, said last August that his
office should have some input into the MIDS program.  The
February DAB meeting is an outgrowth of Betti's request, an Air
Force source said.

MOU/RFP Being Readied

      Describing the current status of the program, a Pentagon
source told us that Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) for FSD
between the participating nations are being finalized and that a
Request for Proposal (RFP) is nearing completion by several
working groups in the MIDS program.  He said a letter of intent
is ready for the various nations to review that, if approved,
would allow the release of the RFP after the DAB meeting next
month.
      If the DAB decides to proceed with a joint venture for MIDS
FSD, meaning Hughes participation in addition to MIDSCO for
example, then the program could be delayed by one and a half to
two years because the acquisition process would have to be
redone, sources said.  RFPs would have to be rewritten and sent
out to industry for comment and bids would have to be obtained
again and  government/industry negotiations would have to start
all over, sources said.
      According to Pentagon sources, the Navy will have the lead
for the U.S. in the program and the Air Force will play a
supporting role.  The Navy F/A-18 jet-fighter will be the U.S.
platform that first uses the MIDS terminal.  A Navy source close
to the program confirmed that this is what OSD has been saying
verbally, but added that OSD's "grammar has been nebulous" and
not totally reassuring.
      Industry sources said the Air Force wanted the lead on MIDS
and had called for the FSD to be competitive.  A Pentagon
official acknowledged that the Air Force did want the lead on the
program but that for budgetary reasons and because it did not
elect the F-16 as a MIDS platform, the Navy was given the lead.
      An Air Force source said he was unaware that a final
decision had been made to give the Navy the lead.

SAR REPORT UNDERSTATES NAVSTAR GPS PROCUREMENT COSTS

      A General Accounting Office (GAO) report states that a
Selective Acquisition Report (SAR) for the Navstar Global
Positioning System (GPS) understates Navy and Marine Corps
requirements by 4,000 units and subsequent procurement costs by
$200 to $400 million.
      Initial SAR estimates in December 1988 said the Air Force
total program cost for user equipment would be $4.1 billion
(escalated dollars) for about 25,500 sets.
      The GAO report also states that delays in operational
testing of low-rate production sets will result in a 15-month
postponement of a full-rate production decision, from March 1989
to June 1990. Operational testing of low-rate production sets
should have been completed in the third and fourth quarters of FY
'90.
      The Navstar GPS is a "space-based radio navigation system
designed to provide precise, continuous, all-weather, common
geographical coordinate system, world positioning navigation
data, together with time and velocity information, for a
multiplicity of military and civil users," according to the
report. The Air Force, Army and Navy joint program has been in
low-rate initial production since June 1986.
      Only 5 percent of all military platforms able to carry the
system will be tested. The report says, "Air Force officials
stated that while the number of test platforms is limited,
additional data from other operational tests for other
modifications involving GPS user equipment will be used and the
combined testing data will cover 90 percent of the interfaces
between GPS user equipment and other navigational and weapon
systems." The platforms to be used are: F-16 fighter; the SH-60
antisubmarine warfare helicopter; LST-1179 tank landing ship;
FFG-7 fast frigate; CG-26 guided missile cruiser; SSN-637 nuclear
powered submarine; SWCL light special warfare craft; the UH-60
Manpack troop transport helicopter; and the HMMWV (High Mobility
Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle).
      A fully operational GPS consists of a space segment with 21
satellites and three orbiting spares, "in six orbital planes
about 10,900 nautical miles above the earth." A ground control
segment with a master control station, three ground antenna and
five monitoring stations around the world to control the
spacecraft are also included. In addition it will contain a user
equipment segment with four types of radio receivers to convert
satellite signals into navigation, time and position information.
      The four types of receivers are: five channel sets for high
performance aircraft; five channel sets for ships and submarines;
two channel sets for medium performance aircraft, like
helicopters; and the Manpack/Vehicular set for hand-held and
vehicle applications. The space segment is in full-rate
production and the control system has been installed and prepared
for Space Command turnover. The GAO report outlined the delay-
plagued program as follows:

UPCOMING GPS EVENT SCHEDULE CHANGES

EVENT                              Dec. 1986   Dec. 1988  Months
                                   Estimate    Estimate   Delayed

Production Satellite Launched      Oct. 1988   Feb. 1989     4
Operational Field Testing Finished June 1989   Aug. 1989     2
Final Operational Test Report                  Apr. 1990    NA
Full-rate Production Decision      Mar. 1989   June 1990    15
GPS Fully Operational              Mar. 1991   Mar. 1993    24

      The report attributes the delays to numerous circumstances
including late deliveries of equipment by contractors, and
contractors experiencing start-up and producibility problems.
"Under the current test plan," the report states, "operational
testing will cover about a five-month period, from July through
November 1989. Analysis and interim report preparation will take
up to 90 days, and final reporting for a full-rate production
decision will take another 60 days. Program officials expect the
final test report to be submitted on April 15, 1990."
      The DoD requires a complete report 45 days prior to a
Defense Acquisition Board meeting. Program officials are
confident that further testing and reporting will be completed by
the June 1990 deadline, according to the report.

RAYTHEON NETS NAVY OTH RADAR AWARD

      Raytheon will construct three Relocatable Over-the-Horizon
Radar (ROTHR) systems for deployment in Virginia, Guam and a
third strategic location under a $273.7 million contract awarded
by the Navy on Dec. 28, 1989.  The first production system will
be deployed in Virginia and will cover the Caribbean.  The Navy
is said to be studying procurement of up to a dozen ROTHRs in
order to minimize the use of ships and aircraft for surveillance.
Raytheon's contract with the Navy includes an option for a fourth
production system.  Each ROTHR can detect aircraft and surface
ships at a range of up to 1,800 miles in an arc in excess of 60
degrees.  Work on the contract is expected to be completed by
1993.

LORAL FINALIZES PURCHASE OF HONEYWELL E-O DIVISION

      Just as this issue went to press, Loral Corp. said it had
completed its purchase of the Electro-Optics Division (EOD) of
Honeywell Inc. for $54 million in cash (AR, Dec. 1, 1989, p. 5).
The new division will be known as Loral Infrared and Imaging
Systems Inc.
      Loral, the nation's 35th largest defense contractor with DoD
contracts for $494 million in FY '88, said the division--a major
producer of electro-optic subsystems and components for airborne
reconnaissance, threat warning detection, passive situation
awareness, missile guidance and targeting--will have 1989 sales
of $130 million and a backlog of $160 million.
      Some of E-O's major projects include the ATARS IR
linescanner and the AAR-47 missile warning system.  Loral said
the acquisition will boost its position in all-weather, high-
resolution, day-night imaging for reconnaissance and missile
guidance across a spectrum of sensor technologies.  Loral
Electro-Optical Systems garnered $76 million in DoD contracts
during fiscal 1988.

Loral Wins $7.7 Million Long-Lead Funding for AN/ALR-56M

      Meanwhile, the Air Force last month awarded $7.7 million in
long-lead funding to Loral for the first production option on the
AN/ALR-56M advanced radar warning receiver (ARWR) for the F-16
and F-4.  The Air Force decision follows Loral's guilty plea to
three counts of violating federal procurement law in the Ill Wind
case relating to the ALR-56M competition (AR, Dec. 15, 1989, p.
5).  Through an agreement, Loral was allowed to remain the prime
contractor on the ALR-56M.
      In a related development, Litton Corp. confirmed that it
will compete against Loral for the $70 million ARWR option that
Loral was forced to drop as part of its settlement with the
government.  The option will come up in 1992.

THOMSON SECURING EUROPEAN ATC WORK

      Recent contracts from the governments of France and
Yugoslavia show Thomson-CSF continuing to expand its role in
European Air Traffic Control.
      The larger contracts, in France, consist of a 65 million FF
agreement to update part of the radioelectric air network for air
navigation and a 15 million FF contract with the French Air
Navigation Technical Department to supply a second experimental
mode S and monopause secondary radar station.
      Yugoslavia meanwhile, has contracted with Thomson CSF to
upgrade and extend that country's ATC.  The value of the contract
was not provided.  It provides for Thomson-CSF to fit two long-
range primary radars it installed at Belgrade and Zagreb in the
early 1970s with more sophisticated receivers and signal
processing units.  These units will be associated with two new
RSM 970 monopause secondary radars.  In addition, a third
independent RSM 970 radar will be installed in the southern
region of Yugoslavia.
