&quot;THE MORTAR AND 
PESTLE&quot;,</strong></font> <font size=3>a publication written and edited 
by pharmacists for healthcare professionals. With the 
advent of managed care, your time is becoming even 
more valuable. Our goal will be to provide you with 
information pertinent to your practice in a brief, easy 
to digest format. Since this newsletter is written by 
pharmacists, it will present health care information as 
it relates to both pharmacy and medicine. We will 
feature several departments on a regular basis. RX 
EDITORIAL will be an article by one of our 
pharmacist editors on a healthcare issue. This 
department will also respond to any medical or 
ethical questions pertaining to the practice of 
pharmacy. RX CAPSULES will be capsules of 
information that will include changes in the law, 
legislative activities and clinical insights that will 
directly affect your practice. RX SOLUTIONS will 
feature a patient case history and how this medical 
problem was solved by the healthcare practitioner. 
The format of this newletter is flexible and will be 
changed to adapt to the needs of its readers. I hope 
that you will find it interesting and valuable.</font> Patty

2 tablespoons lemon juice<br>
1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced<br>

Mix all ingredients into a smooth paste using a 
blender or food processor. If mixture is too dry to 
be spreadable, add some of the reserved bean 
liquid. Sprinkle with paprika. Leave to stand for and 
hour for flavors to develop. Serve with wedges of 
pita bread, crackers, or slices of fresh vegetables.<hr>

</strong></font>Four separate multi-center, double-blind clinical 
trials in the UK have shown that the efficacy of a 
topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug is equal 
to that of oral medication in treatment of soft tissue 
injuries and mild to moderate osteoarthritis. The 
advantage? Plasma concentrations remain low after 
topical application, significantly reducing the 
incidence of GI side effects. The British Medical 
Journal (1995;311:22-6) reports that a post 
marketing study of 23,590 patients using a topical 
NSAID showed only 6 cases of adverse GI events 
that were &quot;definitely&quot; or &quot;probably&quot; related to topical 
NSAID use. Another study of 1103 patients 
demonstrated no significant association between 
topical NSAID therapy and upper GI bleeding and 
perforation. Contact your &quot;problem-solving&quot; 
pharmacist for more information.<br>
<font size=5><strong>DHEA-</strong></font>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a 
steroid produced by the adrenal cortex. DHEA 
levels decline with progressive age. A 1994 study 
demonstrated a higher concentration of insulin 
growth factor (IGF) in the subjects receiving DHEA, 
an indication of increased growth hormone release. 
Patients receiving small daily doses of DHEA have 
shown improved ability to cope, increased mobility, 
less joint discomfort and sounder sleep. Although its 
biologic role is still undefined, itmay prove to be a 
key in slowing the aging process. Additional 
information is available upon request.<br>

SCOP-WHERE ARE YOU?-</strong></font> 
The latest word from CIBA Pharmaceuticals is that 
the patch will not be available until mid 1996, due to 
a production problem discovered by their quality 
managemnet team during a test run. A representative 
from CIBA stated that the difficulty was a &quot;variance&quot;, 
but would not elaborate as to whether the variance 
referred to delivery rate, blood levels or some other 
factor. Contact our compounding pharmacy for 
alternatives.<hr>

Onychomycosis</strong></font><br>
by Bruce Berger, M.D., Dermatologist, Princeton, 
NJ<br>
Traditional therapy for fungal infection of the nail has 
required prolonged therapy with oral griseofulvin, 
and often surgical excision of the nail. Commercially 
available topical creams are ineffective. Oral 
itraconazole has just been approved by the FDA. 
Although more effective than griseofulvin, it still must 
be taken for three months, and the recommended 
dose of two capsules daily is estimated to cost over 
$350 per month. Both oral agents have the potential 
for several serious drug interactions with Seldane, 
Hismanal, Propulsid, Versed, Halcion, and other 
medications. <br>
I have found an effective alternative. This therapy is a 
good selection for patients who can not tolerate the 
oral agents, or those who wish to avoid the potential 
for drug interactions. Itraconazole or fluconazole can 
be placed in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) base, and 
applied topically to the affected nail. DMSO has 
been well-documented as a penetrant-enhancer with 
various other medications, and is key to the success 
of this therapy. I have used these specially 
compounded products in many patients with 
cnychomycosis and have achieved excellent results.<hr>
