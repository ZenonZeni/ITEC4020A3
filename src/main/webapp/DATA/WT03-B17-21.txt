Whether Vietnam and China are now closer or further apart from resolving their competing claims in the South China Sea depends upon the impact of two separate decisions involving a U.S. oil company and Chinese law.<p>

On April 10, after several years of negotiations, PetroVietnam agreed to lease to Conoco Inc. two exploration blocks in the South Con Son Basin. The catch is that these two blocks (133 and 134) overlap part of a tract already leased through the China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNNOC) to the Crestone Energy Corp., a small Denver-based firm. Neither US company plans immediate exploration, and officials of both governments have claimed indisputable sovereignty over the area.<p>

The second decision is two-fold. On May 15 the Chinese government simultaneously ratified the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea convention and announced a set of maritime "baselines."  Its decision on the Law of the Sea follows hints given at last summer's ASEAN conference in Brunei that it might be willing resolve maritime disputes with reference to international law. At the time China's run-in with the Philippines at Mischief Reef was still a recent -- and worrisome -- memory. China's rhetoric in Brunei was called a "major advance." 
This year's ratification of the Law of the Sea might have been likewise hailed had it not been for China's new baseline claims. Maritime baselines connect the outermost points of a country's islands, from which its 12-mile territorial sea and 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) are defined. China's decree follows the coast from the Shandong Peninsula (west of Korea) to Hainan Island (east of Vietnam) -- but then it goes further.<p>

Its baselines also encircle the Paracel (or Xisha) Islands. China has long claimed most of the South China Sea as historical waters; but its current occupation of the Paracels dates from only 1974, when the Chinese navy routed (then South) Vietnamese marines. Vietnam still claims them, and vigorously protests China¹s decree.<p>

Where does that leave us? Crestone may start its two-year project by next May, or may not. Conoco is not likely to begin any sooner. Speculation that they may explore jointly (as hoped for by Crestone) remains just that. Further talk that China may displace Crestone with a major Western oil company would, if true, make joint exploration a more plausible venture. 
On the legal front, China's actions are confusing. "If she has ratified the Convention," says the East-West Center's Mark Valencia, "there is no support in international law and practice for a historic claim to much of the South China Sea." Yet if rumors are correct, China may soon retain a Washington, D.C-based law firm to make its case.<p>
