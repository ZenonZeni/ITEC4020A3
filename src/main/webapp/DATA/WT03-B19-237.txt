<P>
<B><I>Australia</B></I>
<P>
The national consumer market for clothing, fabrics and footwear is $15 billion.
Domestic production employs around 70,000 people and contributes around 1% of GDP.
<P>
The Australian textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) industry is becoming more export-oriented. Wool processing and textiles have benefited from increased foreign investment and the associated increase in value-added exports. Total TCF exports from Australia were $956 million in 1993-94.
<P>
Global trade in textiles and clothing has been growing rapidly and this is forecast to continue with the phased abolition of the Multifibre Agreement and increased demand in Asia for final and intermediate textile, clothing and footwear goods.
<P>
Clothing and footwear continues to rationalise in response to reduced tariffs and increased overseas competition.
<P>
<B><I>Victoria</B></I>
<P>
Victoria dominates national production of textile, clothing, footwear and leather products. The 1,500 TCF establishments in Victoria produce 48% of the national output, 40% of national exports and generate about 2% of Victorias GSP. Employment is around 35,000.  
<P> 
The clothing and footwear sector has adjusted since the late 1980s to lower protection, technological change and a flat domestic market.
<P>
The industry situation has stabilised during the current economic upturn due to a lift in the domestic market and growth in exports. Exports have increased strongly in the 1990s, to be worth $391 million in 1993-94. Textiles comprised 42% of Victoria's TCF exports, clothing and footwear 29% and leather and leather goods contributed 29%.
<P>
Recent investments in the Victorian TCF sector have reinforced Geelong as a major wool processing centre with Godfrey Hirst (carpet manufacturer) expanding its capacity significantly and Geelong Wool Combing investing $85 million, with 50% of production to be exported. In addition, Austanners will be spending $21 million on establishing a tannery.
<P>
<B><I>Prospects</I></B>
<P>
The Bureau of Industry Economics forecasts growth in the sales of Australian TCF manufactures over the period to 2005-6 to average just over 2%.
<P>
Exports are expected to grow from $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion, with most of the increase in the textiles industry the result of continuing foreign direct investment into the Australian wool-processing industry.
<P>
The average effective rate of protection on Australian-made TCF products is expected to fall from 43% in 1991 to about 13% by 2001.
