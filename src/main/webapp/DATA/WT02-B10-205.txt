<h3 align=center>Case Example #2</h3>
<p align=center>(names and details altered to prevent identification)</p>
<p>Gregory, a 43-year-old theatrical manager, was evaluated at an eating disorders clinic in San Francisco. Although he had 
lost 58 pounds in the last 5 months, dropping from 250 to 192 pounds on a 6'1&quot; frame, he was still terrified of getting fat. </p>
<p>Gregory first began to diet 5 months earlier when his wife told him he was &quot;a fat slob&quot; and implied that she might be 
considering a divorce. This terrified him and started him on a strict dietary regimen: an omelet and bran for breakfast, 
coffee for lunch, and salad and shrimp or chicken for dinner. His original goal was to lose about 50 pounds. When dieting 
did not result in sufficiently rapid loss of weight, he started sticking his finger down his throat to induce vomiting after 
meals. </p>
<p>Gregory is now &quot;obsessed&quot; with food. Before he goes to a restaurant, he worries about what he will order. He has done a 
study of what he eats in terms of what is easiest to purge, and he knows all the bathrooms in the areas he frequents. He 
cannot bear feeling full after eating and worries that his stomach is &quot;fat.&quot; Three or four times a week he is unable to resist 
the urge to &quot;binge.&quot; At those times he feels that his eating is out of control, and he may gobble down as much as three 
hamburgers, two orders of french fries, a pint of ice cream, and two packages of Oreo cookies. He always induces vomiting 
after a binge. He has never used laxatives, diuretics, or diet pills to lose weight. </p>
<p>Gregory is also preoccupied with being thin. He has progressively revised downward his original goal in dieting, first to 
190, and then to 185 pounds. He has begun to exercise, walking at least an hour a day and, more recently, working out with 
weights several times a week. He believes that women look at him differently now: when he was heavy, they glanced at him 
casually; now their response is &quot;admiring.&quot; </p>
<p>Gregory has always been somewhat heavy, turning to food in times of stress, but he never worried about his weight until his 
wife criticized his appearance. He can no longer enjoy any meals and feels he has lost control of this area of his life as he 
cannot stop dieting, even though his wife has told him he is now too thin. He therefore recently saw his internist, who found 
no physical problems and referred him for psychiatric evaluation. </p>

<h3 align=center>Discussion </h3>
<p>Gregory's eating disorder began, as is often the case, with a reasonable attempt to lose some weight. He soon became 
preoccupied with losing weight and continued to view his body as &quot;fat&quot; even though others did not. This preoccupation with 
losing weight and distorted body image suggest Anorexia Nervosa, but this diagnosis is not made as Gregory has not let his 
weight go far below the normal minimum for his size. </p>
<p>Gregory's binges (recurrent eating of a large amount of food with a sense of loss of control), his recurrent inappropriate 
compensatory behavior in order to avoid weight gain (in his case, by self-induced vomiting), and the overconcern with 
weight and shape indicate Bulimia Nervosa. As is usually the case in Bulimia Nervosa, the predominant method for 
avoiding weight gain is vomiting, hence the diagnosis is further qualified as Purging Type. Less common methods for 
avoiding weight gain are misuse of laxatives or diuretics (also considered as Purging Type), fasting, and excessive 
exercise. </p>
<p>This case is unusual in that Bulimia Nervosa, like Anorexia Nervosa, is far more common in women than in men </p>
