Deadline Extended</I></CENTER>
</H1>
Due to the extension of the deadline of the SIGMOD/PODS conference, we have
received quite a few requests for extension of the deadline of JIIS special
issue on Data Mining.<BR>
<BR>
Here we announce that there is one week extension of the deadline of this
special issue. That is, the submission must be postmarked by Nov. 7, 1996.
But you must send an on-line abstract by Nov. 1 to <A HREF="mailto:han@cs.sfu.ca">han@cs.sfu.ca</A>
to facilitate timely review.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks for your interest.<BR>

<HR>As a young, promising research area with broad applications, data mining
and knowledge discovery in databases has attracted great interest in the
research communities of database systems, machine learning, statistics,
high performance computing, information retrieval, data visualization, and
many others. As an example, ACM-SIGMOD'96 Workshop on Research Issues on
Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (DMKD'96) held in Montreal, Canada (June
2, 1996) attracted over 100 attendees. Also, KDD'96 conference, to be held
in Portland, Oregon, August 2-4, 1996, received over 200 submissions.<BR>
<BR>
With such overwhelming interest in this area, the Journal of Intelligent
Information Systems (JIIS) is organizing a special issue on Data Mining.
The information on JIIS and instructions to authors are available at:<BR>
