ALL IS NOT CALM AT ALLCOMM:
ITS USE OF "CELLULAR ONE" STIRS UP A LEGAL TUSSLE

    When Pactel Mobile Access purchased the non-wireline system in Atlanta,
Ga., from Gencell and opted not to use the "Cellular One" trade name, as it has
in other non-wireline markets, the result was that no one was using the
Cellular One trademark in Atlanta.
    Enter Allcomm Telecommunications Inc., a cellular reseller in Atlanta.
Beginning last September, the name "Cellular One Atlanta" made its appearance
in the Atlanta phone book.  Call the number, however, and you'll find yourself
talking to a customer service rep from Allcomm.  "We have filed (in Georgia) as
'Cellular One Atlanta Corp., doing business as Cellular One,'" Allcomm
president Peter Bright told CS&M.  Why?  "Two reasons," Bright said.  "First,
we are providing a public service to help roamers.  We had a perfect example
today.  A Cellular One customer roaming here from Cincinnati broke his antenna.
He found the name Cellular One [in the phone book], called us, and we fixed
it."
    Second, "the name Cellular One has never been used in Atlanta and probably
never will be used.  Pactel spent multimillion dollars to promote its own
name."
    But aren't you concerned that the owners of the Cellular One trademark
might object?  "They only charge $1 a year [for a non-wireline company] to use
the name.  So we're not robbing them.  We're ready to pay our dollar, but they
won't take it.  We'll sign any document they want to provide us.  [One of their
lawyers] said we couldn't use it 'because you're a reseller and we only license
the name to carriers.'
    "Our argument is that we're a provider of cellular service.  We have a full
sales and service force that can help customers, so we decided to go ahead and
use the name....We get calls [from our phone-book listing] all the time such
as, 'I'm trying to reach a Cellular One customer roaming in Atlanta; how do I
do it?' or 'I'm roaming in Atlanta; how do I access the system?' or 'I'm having
equipment trouble; can you help me?'"
    Allcomm is the company's official name.  The name Cellular One appears only
in the phone book, not in any of the company's public advertising, its
letterheads, calling cards, etc.  "When someone calls," Bright explained, "our
reps immediately explain that, 'No, we are not Cellular One.  We're Allcomm
Telecommunications, a reseller for the non-wireline in Atlanta.  We provide
sales and service.  Can we be of assistance to you?'"
    When asked about Allcomm's use of the trademark, Southwestern Bell Mobile
Systems (which was apparently unaware of the usage) replied, in an official
statement issued through director of marketing communications Walter Patterson:
"The Cellular One logo is the service mark of Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems,
and it is protected by trademark laws.  It is a violation to willingly use the
mark without the proper authorization from SBMS.  If anyone attempts to use it
without authorization, we will exercise our legal rights to prevent them from
doing so, and we have a responsibility to the companies or individuals who are
using the service mark properly.  Hand in hand with that is our responsibility
to existing and potential customers.  They should be able to feel confident
that when they call Cellular One, they are indeed dealing with Cellular One,
and not with someone else."  Patterson also added that "we haven't received a
written request from Allcomm to use the logo."  Meanwhile, Bright explained
that the earlier request had been oral; a written request is now being
prepared.  (Allcomm Telecommunications Inc., 11230 Hwy. 9, Suite 110, Roswell,
GA 30076, 404/343-9237; Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems Inc., 17330 Preston
Rd., Suite 100A, Dallas, TX 75252, 214/733-3000.)

Meanwhile, Nynex Mobile Communications Co. turned on its 200,000th customer on
Dec. 8.  The honored customer, Barbara Moska, an associate vice-president for
Prudential-Bache Securities, was presented with a Nynex 832SR cellular
telephone.  Nynex reported that it has doubled its subscriber base in
"slightly less than 14 months," including more than 125,000 customers in the
N.Y. metropolitan area.  Nynex Mobile Communications Co. president Charles Many
commented that "the fact that our 200,000th customer is a woman reflects the
changes that the cellular market is experiencing as we head into the next
decade.  Five years ago, our customer base was roughly 4% women; now it's close
to 20%.  In fact, women make up the fastest growing segment of the cellular
telephone industry."

RSA markets will account for just 2% of the cellular subscriber population

RSA markets will account for just 2% of the cellular subscriber population by
1993, Economic and Management Consultants International Inc. (EMCI) predicts in
a recent report.  Almost 40% of the subscribers will be in markets 1-10, 21% in
markets 11-30, 14% in markets 31-60, 8.5% in markets 61-90, 5% in markets 91-
120 and 10% in markets 121-305.  At the end of 1988, Dallas had the highest
penetration of the top-10 markets.  Some of the smaller markets have
demonstrated even faster relative growth rates than the larger cities, EMCI
said.  These are a few of the findings reported in "The Cellular Marketplace,
1989," a 130-page report available from EMCI for $850.  (EMCI, 1101 N. Highland

"Cellular 21" is the company name, but it's not cellular as we know it

"Cellular 21" is the company name, but it's not cellular as we know it today.
Matt Edwards has received an experimental license from the FCC to experiment
with the new CT-2 ("CT" means "cordless telephone") technology, which is making
such a splash in Europe.  CT-2 is "single-channel, duplex, spectrum-efficient,
with frequencies that can be reused every half mile--or less," Edwards said.
He believes that CT-2 "will take away the whole low end of the cellular
business before it starts," he told us during a recent interview.  Why?
Edwards pointed out that, according to the Wall Street Journal, 70% of the
households in the U.S. have no discretionary income.  The remaining 30% have an
average of $1000 per month for discretionary income.  These figures mean that
of the nation's 78 million households, the potential cellular market is "no
more than 10 million households.  We're betting that...cellular will peak out
at 8 to 9 million....We think [CT-2] is the answer to cellular in the 21st
Century....[The new technology] is the only way of supporting a large number of
users."  (Cellular 21 Inc., 301 Route 17N, Rutherford, NJ 07070, 800/662-4520

TIME FOR A NEW ABBREVIATION:  "SRP"--"SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE"

    We are coining a NEW ABBREVIATION, which our industry has needed for a
long time.  The abbreviation is "SRP," which means "suggested retail price."
Of course, we all know a phone with an SRP of $599 will, because of carrier
bounties, sell for $399--or even less.  No manufacturer today expects any
carrier or retailer to actually sell a phone anywhere near its SRP.  The SRP
does, however, present a starting point for comparison purposes.

CES REPORT:  IS CELLULAR FINALLY GOING RETAIL?
RETAILERS, MANUFACTURERS THINK SO.

    The cellular industry as a whole may not be ready for it, and penetration
rates are a long way from showing it, but cellular is rapidly becoming a retail
product--so rapidly that the vast majority of sales (even though they may not
be "good" sales, meaning that they may be low-revenue generators for the
carriers) may soon be made at the retail level.
    That opinion, in one form or another--primarily in the way the
manufacturers are packaging, pricing and promoting their new lines and the way
that high-volume, discount electronic firms are getting into cellular--seemed
to show up everywhere we looked at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES)
in Las Vegas.
    So great was cellular's influence at CES that this show (and its summer
equivalent in Chicago) is the one that is seeing the introduction of more new
cellular products than any other show.  Could it be that cellular is finally
penetrating through to the consumer market?
    As Mark Ripley, VP-network for GTE Cellular Communications, put it in the
session entitled, "Cellular:  Not Just Another Cordless Phone":  "Cellular is
altering the way people think about communications.  Most people who use
cellular become addicted to it."
    Despite the addiction potential, the sale of cellular can be a tough one.
Al Brotsky, president of Al & Ed's Autosound of Monterey Park, Calif., put it
this way at the same session:  "If you were to ask me to choose the most
complex product to sell at retail and still make a profit, it would be
cellular, hands down."  He stressed the importance of educating the retail
salesperson.  "Only 10% of your competition has studied the latest benefits and
features of cellular," he said.  "The more you know, the more you sell for
more."
    Indeed, we are seeing the "birth of an industry," telecommunications
analyst and market researcher Herschel Shosteck of Silver Spring, Md.,
explained during a presentation at the Mobile Electronics Retailing and
Installation session during the convention.  He noted that even though cellular
has barely penetrated 17% of the business market, he predicted that the total
cellular users in 1995 should reach 12-22 million, an upward revision of his
earlier prediction of 12-20 million.  Particularly significant today, he said,
is the increased percentage of purchases that are replacement units (8%) and
add-ons (or second unit, e.g., purchase of a second phone for the spouse)
(27%).  He also noted that 48% of all portables are purchased by individuals
who already own cellular phones, which means that salespeople should go after
their existing cellular customers and attempt to step them up to a portable.
"The portable market is expanding explosively," he said.

NEC America Inc., 383 Omni Dr., Richardson, TX 75080, 214/907-4000 or

NEC America Inc., 383 Omni Dr., Richardson, TX 75080, 214/907-4000 or 800/421-
2141, introduced its new portable, the NEC P300.  It lent several models to
press and other influential attendees to try out during the convention.
Weighing in at just 14 oz., the phone is the second-smallest model on the
market and is, in fact, slightly thinner though longer than the Motorola Micro
TAC (see lead story, CSM, May 1989).  A unique feature is the built-in flip-up
1/4-wave unity-gain antenna.  Also included with the phone is a screw-in 1/4-
wave, 1.2 dB gain, rubber duck antenna for use in fringe areas.  The phone
contains 99 alphanumeric memory locations, 2- or 3-touch dial-from-memory,
automatic storage of dialed numbers, a slightly recessed power button to
prevent unintentional activation and VOX operation.  It also contains a clock
with a built-in alarm that will turn the phone on at a predetermined time--a
useful feature if you are expecting a call at a specific time but don't want to
leave the phone turned on, draining the batteries, while waiting.  Marketing
director Bruce McClelland told us the phone can survive a 2-meter drop test.
"If Braun was to build a cellular phone, it would look like this," he said.
The phone offers 80 minutes of talk time or 18 hours of standby.  Also, you can
answer a ringing phone by touching any key (except the power key); no need to
scramble for the SEND key.  Options include an external antenna and cigarette
lighter kit, as well as a handsfree kit and a booster kit for the car, plus a 1
1/2 hour rapid charger.  SRP $1799.

C.M. Telecom, 14675 Titus St., Panorama City, CA 91402, 818/780--0380, showed
"3 boxes, 2 phones," director of sales-eastern region Dino Vakoutis explained.
The 2 phones are AR3800M mobile and the AR3800T transportable (weight 4.8 lb.),
both of which are handsfree.  The 3 boxes contain:  (1) transceiver and
handset, (2) transportable kit, and (3) handsfree car kit.  Look for delivery
of mobiles in February and transportables in March, Vakoutis said.  The phones
have 3, 1.5 and 0.6 user-selected power settings, signal- and battery-strength
indicators, dual NAM and alphanumeric memory dial with 99 memories.  The phones
offer an autodial function, which can be turned on or off, that automatically
sends the call a few seconds after it is recalled from memory.  A new feature:
to answer an incoming call, you simply touch any of the top 12 keys on the pad.
The phone also offers one feature that helps reduce churn for the carrier.
"When you program the phone, you put a code in that prohibits the phone from
being reprogrammed unless the customer has the code.  The customer first has to
call the carrier to get the code," he said.  "This gives the carrier one last
shot at keeping the customer."  The target market:  "We are going after
carriers and distributors in a market" and offering them exclusive distribution
agreements.  The phones are also being offered for private labeling, "even on
smaller orders."  Dealer price is in the"mid-$400s" for the car phone and the
"low $600s" on the transportable.

Technophone Corp. (NEW ADDRESS:  1801 Penn St., Suite 3, Melbourne, FL 32901,
407/952-2100) is expected to introduce a new transportable, the model TC905A,
which will be available 'in about 6 months," marketing director Sandy Queen
told us.  It will be identical to the ME905 mobile.  The transportable kit is
retrofitable to the ME905, also.  Because the ESN is in the handset, you can
use the same handset with more than one phone.  The transportable weighs 6
lbs., has 1 hour of talk time or 8 hours of standby, and has a SRP of $799.
Technophone's mobile line is made in Hong Kong.
    Also new at the show:  the MC915A, which has a completely different styling
from the TC905 to make it more appealing to a retail market.  "It's a basic
model," Queen said.  It has a 30-number memory dial, ESN in the handset, and
works car-to-car with the cigarette lighter plug or can be converted into a
transportable by adding a battery.  "We're hoping that users will buy a
transceiver and a bag and use the handset from the car," Queen said.
Suggested retail:  $699.
    Technophone also introduced a new program for dealers and sales people,
Technopoints '90.  Every phone sold earns the salesperson or dealer a certain
number of points.  The points can then be traded for a variety of prizes out of
a glossy catalog.

Neither did we until NovAtel Carcom VP-general manager Ira Tabankin explained
how they do it.  NovAtel manages this incredible feat of manufacturing by
producing a line of different-on-the-outside handset styles but using the same
innards.  "We're showing about 75 different [handsets] in this booth,"
Tabankin said. The OEM buyer can select the style and the color for deliveries.
The other variables are contained in the software of the model 8320
transceiver, "the brains of the system," Tabankin said.  The buyer can choose
zero, 9, 30, 50, 75 or 100 memories; 1 to 4 NAMs; alpha or numeric-only memory
dial.  (NovAtel Carcom Inc., 3800 Sandshell Dr., Ft. Worth, TX 76137, 817/847-

One of the most exciting products for the portable/mobile office that we saw at
the show was the new plain paper MFAX portable fax machine from U.S. Marketing
International Inc., 7405 Caminito Rialto, La Jolla, CA 92037, 619/551-8834.
The fax uses standard, perforated computer paper, or it can also use standard
typewriter or photocopy machine paper.  It weighs a mere 3.5 lbs. and works
either on 4 "C" batteries or any 6V plug-in adapter.  It is full group 3
compatible, working at 9600 baud (25 seconds per page).  It works with either
an acoustic coupler or a direct RJ11 jack to a desk or cellular telephone.
"The businessperson can now travel with their own fax machine in the briefcase
and no longer have to pay the ridiculous cost that hotels charge you to receive
faxes," explained Arnold Fisher, president and CEO of U.S.M.I.  "I paid $54 at
my hotel to receive 13 pages of copy!" he said.  The fax machine uses an H-P
jet ink printer and cartridge and produces faxes that are equal to or even
better than the quality available from standard desk machines.  It can also be
used as a printer for your laptop, a copy machine or a scanner.  SRP, $599.

A complete package of low-tech products assembled in one gift box and called
"The Mobile Office" was the offering of S. Hochman, 320 Frontier Way,
Templeton, CA 93465, 800/852-5888 or 805/434-3400.  The complete package
contains Hochman's new Notes on the Go, a suction-cup mounted pad holder that
sticks to the car windshield, complete with a built-in flashlight to illuminate
the pad at night.  The box also contains Numbers to Go (a flip-down address
book; see CSM, April 1989, for details), a U.S. roaming directory, a penlight
flashlight, a first-aid kit, a Rand McNally state and city pocket atlas, a
tire-pressure gauge.  The complete kit retails for $49.95.  "The man in the
house is probably the hardest person in the world to buy for at Christmas or
Father's Day," company president Sandy Hochman said.  "He generally gets a
shirt, socks, yet he may spend 2-3 hours a day in the car.  So why not give him
something that's useful?  And, of course," he added, to avoid appearing to be
chauvinistic, "this also applies to the wife!  We have more and more men and
women using their cars as an office."  [A tip:  If you're having trouble
getting your Notes on the Go (or other windshield-mounted note pad) to stick on
the window, clean the window first with rubbing alcohol, not Windex; "It leaves
a residue," he said.]  "I don't think cellular carriers are grasping the value
of cellular as much as the retailers," Kochman said.  "Carriers seem to think
that every [relatively inexpensive item, such as Notes on the Go] has to be
given away as a premium.  The retailer offers these 'premiums' as accessories
for the cellular buyer and turns them into a profit center.  The way prices of
phones are coming down, the cellular stores are going to have to look for other
profit centers.  They've got a captive audience.

BELL ATLANTIC BEGINS FULL-SCALE TV CAMPAIGN; AIMS AT RETAIL

    The retail cellular market may finally be here.  "The time is right,"
explained Melanie vanderValk, director of advertising and corporate
communications for Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems.  "I saw our December sales
figures.  Retail sales [during the Christmas season] were significantly more
than we had been projecting....Retail is a big part of our distribution now."
    This new, intense interest in and sales response at the retail level has
led Bell Atlantic to develop a new TV ad campaign aimed specifically at
attracting both the business and retail customers.  The campaign will appear in
2 flights, the first running through April, and the second beginning in the
summer.
    "Our customer profile is shifting from 100% business to more consumer
applications," vanderValk said.  "A lot of people are starting to justify
cellular from a safety and convenience point of view."  Consumer resistance to
the product is beginning to fade, she said, because the message is finally
getting through that cellular is no longer an unaffordable technology.
    Why TV?  "Two reasons," she said.  "First, it's more economical now to use
TV than it was in the past.  We have a broader target market to reach because
cellular is now affordable to the mass market.  Second, TV advertising is very
compelling."
    The campaign consists of two 30-second commercials that spotlight the
dependability of the Bell Atlantic cellular network and how important the phone
can be when, for example, your car breaks down 15 miles from the next exit.
The three 10-second spots      emphasize how affordable cellular is today.  One
spot compares the cost of cellular to the cost of laundering your shirts:  "For
the money you spend at the cleaners, you could be using a car phone on the Bell
Atlantic System.  And, who knows?  Maybe you could clean up."  Another compares
the cost of cellular and gasoline:  "You can use a car phone...for less [then
the cost of fuel], and put something in your car that can make you money."
    To support its retail effort, Bell Atlantic has developed a merchandising
kit for the retailers, containing banners, coverage maps and prices, tent
cards, a pocket sales guide, and so on.  The pocket sales guide, for example,
is a laminated card that slips into the salesperson's pocket and provides
instant answers to the most frequently asked questions about cellular.  "We're
also in the process of testing an interactive video guide," she said, which
would allow shoppers to get answers to commonly asked questions by accessing

CELLULAND'S NETWORK-WIDE PROMO EXCEEDS SALES QUOTA BY 150%

    Working together as a network, CelluLand recently demonstrated that
combined buying power can work wonders.  Combining the purchasing clout of 23
nationwide franchisees in 9 states with special market development funds
available from Mitsubishi Electric Sales America Inc. (MESA), and adding in the
excitement of a sales contest, CelluLand's outlets sold more than 1,000 MESA
DiamondTel phones, exceeding their combined sales quota of by more than 150%.
The theme of the campaign was, "The best things in life are free."  The
salesperson who sold the most phones during the 2-month contest received a
Caribbean cruise.  Other prizes ranged from Bahamas cruises through TVs, VCRs
and cellular phones.
    Mark Epstein, the director of special projects for CelluLand, drew on his
experience selling stereo/hi-fi equipment in the 1970s and computers in the
early 1980s when he concocted the idea for the special promotion.
    "Market development funds, which are also called key account funds, are
funds that are...used if anybody comes up with an interesting way of promoting
their product," Epstein said.  "Most manufacturers don't promote the fact that
they have these funds available, but if you go to them with a good idea, they
have the funds available.  It's a matter of knowing how to present your idea to
the manufacturer."
    Epstein convinced Mitsubishi Electric Sales America Inc. (MESA) to expend
these market development funds in a joint promotional effort.  "I came up with
a promotion idea to try and stimulate sales of their product throughout our
franchise network," he said.  "They committed the funds subject to our
purchasing the product over a 60-day period.  We exceeded our quota by 150%.
We expected to sell 400 phones; we sold more than 1,000."  Seeing that this was
the first joint promotion, we were a bit conservative in our estimates....From
everyone's standpoint, it was a tremendous success."
    None of the advertising mentioned the price of the product.  "We positioned
ourselves not as a discount-price shop but as someone who could really deliver
quality and service at a higher price," he said.  One ad, for example, was
headlined:  "They say the best things in life are free."  The ad pictured MESA
DiamondTel portable and car phones.  The "free" benefits applied to accessories
and services, not to the price of the phone itself, and included:  Free mount
and antenna (with car phones), free carrying case (with transportables), "free
time to devote to leisure and business activities."  "Service sets us apart":
free testing and tuning, free loaner phone when necessary, free one-year
extended product warranty and free lifetime installation warranty.  (CelluLand
Inc.,  10717 Sorrento Valley Rd., San Diego, CA 92121, 619/455-1600.)

WASHINGTON (D.C.)-AREA BUSINESSES START
AN ASSOCIATION FOR CELLULAR USERS

    Cellular carriers, independent cellular carriers, cellular dealers and
cellular agents all have their own trade associations, and now so do cellular
users.  "If users are better educated and understand their phones better,
they'll be better customers," explained Jess Johnson, one of the organizers of
the National Association of Cellular Users (NACU).
    "The new association is not in competition with existing associations such
as CTIA, Telocator or USICTA," co-founder Mike Manning told CS&M.  Johnson and
Manning are partners in the Vienna, Va.,-based company Marketing International.
The third co-founder is David Shira, president of Cellular Savers Group Inc.,
also of Vienna, Va.  "Just like them, we want to expand the cellular industry,"
Manning said.  "The association is intended to provide services directly to
users of cellular service.  We're hoping to get people to use the system more
and get others to get on board and start using cellular."
    The founders are in the process of incorporating the association, adopting
its by-laws and forming its board of directors.
    The association will also express its point of view on legislative and
regulatory issues such as calling-party pays and the registration (or even
outright prohibition of ownership, as has been proposed for teenagers and
pagers) of cellphones.
    Vendors, carriers, agents and manufacturers are also invited to join as
associate members.  "We want them to feel at home with us," Johnson said.  "We
are now talking with industry leaders to form a standards and good practices
committee to promote a better climate for the continued growth of the cellular
industry," the group said in its first official statement.  "If you are
interested in contributing your expertise or would like to learn more about the
association's charter, services and membership costs, call 1-800-736-4720."
