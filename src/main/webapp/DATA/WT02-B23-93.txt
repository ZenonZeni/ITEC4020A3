programs such as: A+ Certification, EDI/Bar Code Standards, Public 
Policy, and other industry initiatives.

Public Policy Committee

Staff Liaison:  John A. Venator, HQ, ext. 306
The Public Policy Committee serves as a “watchdog” for legislation

A+ Certification Task Force

Staff Liaison:  Lynn Larson, HQ,ext. 305

in the microcomputer industry. Phase I concentrated on certifying 
computer service technicians.

Perhaps CompTIA’s most well-known and successful program, A+ 
Certification continues to soar past all prior estimates for its 
success.  As of May, 1995, there were more than 15,000 A+ Certified 
computer service technicians and some 922 A+ Authorized Service 
Centers across the U.S. and Canada.

An enhanced, new modular exam – with a Core, a Windows/DOS module and 
a Macintosh module – went live in April 1995.  Work continues on the 
next levels in A+ Certification, which includes development of modules 
for a number of possible areas, such as LAN/Connectivity, Storage, 
UNIX, Localization (translation into 6 foreign languages),  Customer 
Interactions, etc.  Task Forces for each area have been formed.

Ad Hoc Chapter Expansion Task Force

Staff Liaison:  Terri Baron, HQ, ext. 312
This section brings together manufacturers, resellers, VARs and 
systems integrators on a local basis and was formed to promote 
communication and information exchange on channel issues.

Toward this end, Chicago-area resellers formed a local chapter to 
focus on emerging technologies, channel strategies that work and to 
provide a forum for strategic partnerships that will help them build 
business success in the 90s.

The group plans to meet nine or 10 times during 1995 and will focus on 
continuing education for CompTIA members in the context of a 
professional association.

Electronic Commerce Task Force

Staff Liaison:  Martha Wahoski, VA Office, ext. 302
The mission of the Electronic Commerce Task Force is to establish 
industry guidelines for the consistent use of bar code and electronic 
data interchange technologies. Further, the group also focuses on 
evaluating other types of emerging electronic technology to determine 
its potential for enhancing industry operations. 

Business processes are analyzed by the task force and its work teams 
so that models can be created to assist industry firms in the 
re-engineering of their businesses to capitalize on these technologies 
to improve profitability and enhance customer satisfaction.

This group is also concerned with establishing an EDI version of the 
industry standard generic warranty claim form to improve the 
efficiency of the channel, including pre-established failure codes. 
Current efforts focus on reducing the cost of product diagnosis and 
speeding up claim processing.

Staff Liaison:  Terri Baron, HQ, ext. 312
This specially focused group serves as a forum for distributor members 
of the Association to address their specific issues within the

effectiveness of the computer distributor in addressing, recommending 
and communicating programs, standards and/or guidelines to the 
industry and that improve the overall efficiency and financial 
stability of the channel.

Document Imaging Section

Staff Liaison: John Venator, HQ, ext. 306
The Document Imaging Section is a special interest group formed to 
promote reseller understanding of Document Imaging technology.

August of 1995, with the “official” launch of the CDIA program 
anticipated in the fourth quarter of 1995.

Finance/Credit Section

Staff Liaison:  Bill West, HQ, ext. 311
This section provides a forum in which primary financial/credit 
decision makers can come together to discuss financial and leasing 
needs and other related issues of the industry.

The section oversees the Credit Interchange Program, administered 
through the National Association of Credit Management (NACM), which 
allows program participants to exchange credit information through 
on-line reports.

Service & Support Section

Staff Liaison:  Lynn Larson, HQ, ext. 305
The Service & Support Section is comprised of managers and executives 
of member companies interested in improving the quality and efficiency 
of repair and preventive maintenance services provided to customers. 

The Section continues to focus its attention on three main areas:  Customer 
Interactions; EDI/Warranty Claims Process; and ESD/Virus Protection.  

The first steps toward having the EDI/Warranty Claims efforts of the 
Section be coordinated with those of the Warranty Claims Task Force 
have now been taken.  The group has begun to work on defining the 
missing pieces in the current process. In the area of Customer 
Interactions, a subgroup of the Section is in the process of defining 
a methodology for enhancing customer interactions.  The scope and 
objectives of the group are: 
 
     a) identify the importance of customer interactions; 
     b) awareness; 
     c) appreciation; 
     d) standards (a list of skills required for effective customer 
     interactions); 
     e) affordable. 

   Tactics outlined to achieve those goals/objectives include:  

     1) gather information; 
     2) standards; 
     3) develop a methodology and ements; 
     4) review/revise the methodology as appropriate.  

This group and a similar A+ Certification Task Force subgroup have 
been merged in order to coordinate and focus this effort. The ESD and 
Virus Protection Task Force, another subgroup of this Section, has 
begun a Static Awareness Campaign.  In addition, the group is working 
on defining virus protection problems and their impact on the 
industry.

Software Section

Staff Liaison:  Lynn Larson, HQ, ext. 321
This section brings together software manufacturers in a forum 
designed to promote communication and information exchange on channel 
issues.

The Section gathers information and discusses a variety of issues 
related to trends and technologies in the software industry; e.g.:  
software encryption, EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) and marketing 
software into the bookstore industry.
