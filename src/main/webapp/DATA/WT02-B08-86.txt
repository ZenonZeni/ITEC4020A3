<H1>Balancing neurobiology to minimise affective disorders</H1>
<H3>Thursday plenary session: Mechanisms of recurrence and cyclicity in
the affective disorders: implications for treatment</H3>
There is evidence that stressors in episodes of affective illness can induce
neurobiological changes at the level of gene expression, according to Dr
Robert Post from the National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, USA.
In his plenary lecture today, Dr Post explains why this finding makes early
treatment important in reducing vulnerability to - and recurrence of - affective
disorders.<BR>
Dr Post says that three main factors affect vulnerability to affective disorders
- heredity, stressors and previous episodes. He explains that two main types
of neurobiological changes are observed during affective disorders - they
are either part of the pathophysiological process or are secondary adaptations
to counter these processes. &quot;The balance between these factors accounts
for the suppression or recurrence of depression,&quot; Dr Post says. &quot;We
think these principles also hold for bipolar depression, where imbalances
can lead to a depressive state or, in the opposite direction, can predispose
the patient to a manic episode,&quot; he adds.<BR>
Reducing the initial stressor response through early treatment - whether
in the form of psychotherapy, social support, drugs or other therapies -
is important. Dr Post discusses promising research into new therapeutic
approaches during his plenary lecture.<BR>
Dr Robert Post's plenary lecture is from 1130-1230 in the John Batman theatre
today.<BR>

<H1>New president for CINP: <BR>
Dr Claude de Montigny</H1>
<BR>
<BR>
Dr Claude de Montigny, Professor of Psychiatry, Pharmacology and Neuroscience
at McGill University, Montreal, Canada, and Director of the Neurobiological
Psychiatry Unit of the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University begins
his term as President of CINP at the XXth CINP Congress.<BR>
Dr de Montigny received his MD at the University of Montreal, Canada, and
obtained his PhD in Neuroscience from the Neuroscience Research Center of
the University of Montreal. He trained in psychiatry at McGill and completed
postdoctorate training at Yale University as a centennial fellow of the
Medical Research Council of Canada. Dr de Montigny's research interests
have focused on the mechanism of action of antidepressant treatments and
of lithium. His research is subsidised by the Canadian Medical Research
Council (1978-2001) and the Fonds de la Recherche en Sant&eacute; du Qu&eacute;bec
(1987-1998). 
<H3>Recipient of 1995 Selo Prize</H3>
Dr de Montigny was the sole recipient of the Selo prize awarded by the National
Alliance for Research into Schizophrenia and Affective Disorders in 1995.
The nomination was based on the seminal work of Dr de Montigny and his team,
unveiling the adaptive neuronal mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect
of antidepressant treatment, as well as the discovery of a novel therapeutic
approach for major depression resistant to antidepressant treatment. <BR>

<H1>Growing role for cholecystokinin</H1>
<H2>Thursday symposium: Cholecystokinin in anxiety.</H2>
Systemic administration of a tetrapeptide derived from cholecystokinin (CCK-4)
has been shown to induce anxiety in healthy human volunteers, patients with
panic disorder, and different animal species, including the mouse, rat,
cat, sheep and monkey. In this morning's symposium Dr Roberta Palmour from
the Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, describes
evidence for a dose-related, CCK-agonist-mediated increase in anxiety-related
behaviours in primates.<BR>
Dr Jacques Bradwejn from the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Toronto, Canada,
discusses CCK-B agonists and panic induction in humans, and factors that
may enhance or antagonise this response. Data supporting the hypothesis
that CCK may play an important role in human anxiety states is also presented
by Dr Robert Lydiard from the Medical University of South Carolina, Charlston,
USA. 
<H3>Tools of the trade</H3>
CCK receptor agonists and antagonists are important tools for understanding
the possible roles of CCK as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the
central nervous system. Dr Eero Vasar from the Department of Physiology,
University of Tartu, Estonia, examines the effect of CCK agonist and antagonist
administration on the exploratory and locomotor activity of rodents, and
relates these findings to human studies.<BR>
In another presentation at this morning's symposium, Dr Bernard Roques from
the Departement de Pharmacochimie Moleculaire et Structurale, Universite
Rene Descartes, Paris, France, presents pharmacological data and behavioural
evidence to lend support for the existence of CCK-B receptor subtypes.<BR>

<H1>New forum to promote mental health issues in the Asia-Pacific region</H1>
<H2>Regional meeting report: Agenda for mental health in the Asia-Pacific
region to the year 2000 </H2>
Effective collaboration to meet the contrasting mental health needs of different
countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region is the key aim of a new forum
established at a regional meeting last Saturday. <BR>
The meeting, held at the University of Melbourne Business School, was attended
by 35 people from eight countries in the region, including representatives
from the World Psychiatry Association (WPA), delegates from the XXth CINP
Congress in Melbourne and psychiatrists from Australia and New Zealand.
The Department of Psychiatry, the University of Melbourne, will provide
the Secretariat for the forum.<BR>
Professor Bruce Singh from the Department of Psychiatry, the University
of Melbourne, Australia, who coordinated Saturday's meeting, said that a
host of issues faced psychiatry &quot;as the entire range of industrial
and economic levels of development are represented in the Asia-Pacific region.
The mental health needs of a small Pacific island are very different to
those of, for example, mainland China.&quot;<BR>
Professor Singh said that the new forum aims to establish collaborative
links between mental health services, research institutes and educational
institutions. These links will:<BR>
&#183; support the development of national mental health policies<BR>
&#183; increase awareness of fellowship training<BR>
&#183; increase greater awareness of mental health in the Asia-Pacific region.<BR>
Proceedings of the meeting will be sent to all who attended as well as relevant
organisations throughout the Asia-Pacific region. <BR>
The next meeting of the forum will be held at the WPA Regional Meeting of
Psychiatry in Beijing, China, in 1997. For further information please contact:<BR>

<H1>Paroxetine drug of choice for panic disorder</H1>
<H2>Tuesday satellite meeting: Panic and depression: not all SSRIs are the
same.</H2>
Paroxetine is emerging as the first drug of choice for treating panic disorder,
according to speakers at Tuesday's satellite meeting.<BR>
Only three drugs are approved for the treatment of panic disorder - alprazolam,
clomipramine and paroxetine. Alprazolam and clomipramine have been used
for several years, and paroxetine has recently been licensed. <BR>
The search for an effective treatment for panic disorder began with tricyclics,
MAOIs, and then benzodiazepines. &quot;It was then recognised that the SSRIs
were a better treatment,&quot; says Professor Graham Burrows from the Department
of Psychiatry, Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre, Melbourne, Australia.<BR>
&quot;A few years ago there was a feeling that SSRIs were the drugs to use,
despite the fact there was almost no controlled data in the literature,&quot;
said Professor James Ballenger from the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural
Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charlston, USA. &quot;However,
there is now short- and even long-term data published supporting this.&quot;
<H3>Multiple trials demonstrate efficacy</H3>
A 12-week study found that paroxetine combined with cognitive therapy at
least halved the number of panic attacks experienced by 85% of patients
compared with 51% of those receiving placebo combined with cognitive therapy.
&quot;Paroxetine in combination with cognitive therapy is significantly
better than placebo, and patients on paroxetine in other studies where cognitive
therapy was not part of the treatment still did well,&quot; Professor Ballenger
continued.<BR>
The study found that paroxetine is significantly more effective, better
tolerated and associated with fewer side-effects than clomipramine. At the
end of 12-weeks treatment, 51% of paroxetine patients and 37% of clomipramine
patients were free of panic attacks compared with 32% of patients on placebo.
Improvement in the paroxetine group also began earlier. &quot;Paroxetine
worked faster than clomipramine,&quot; Professor Ballenger said, &quot;and
it is also better tolerated&quot;.<BR>
Extension of the paroxetine versus clomipramine study to one year showed
that paroxetine continued to prevent panic attacks.<BR>
Randomisation to placebo of some of the patients in the study revealed that
relapse is an issue if treatment is not continued. Only 5% of patients who
continued to take paroxetine experienced a relapse compared with 30% of
those switched to placebo. &quot;You need to stay on the medication to stay
well,&quot; Professor Ballenger explained. 
<H3>Better tolerated, fewer drop-outs</H3>
Overall, fewer adverse effects were experienced by patients on paroxetine
compared with those on clomipramine, and the incidence decreased as treatment
continued. Adverse effects were responsible for treatment withdrawal in
14.9% of patients on clomipramine, 7.3% of patients on paroxetine and 11.4%
of patients in the placebo group.<BR>
&quot;The most drop-outs were in the clomipramine group. There were fewer
drop-outs in the paroxetine group than in the placebo group,&quot; said
Professor Ballenger. 
<H3>Low doses may not be enough</H3>
It is important to use the correct dose of paroxetine for panic disorder,
and the dosage may need to be higher than that required for the treatment
of depression. &quot;The optimal dose is 40mg. If you use less than 40 mg
and patients are not doing <BR>
very well, the dose should be raised,&quot; recommended Professor Ballenger.

<HR>
<H1>Panic is a highly comorbid condition</H1>
<H2>Tuesday satellite meeting: Panic and depression: not all SSRIs are the
same.</H2>
The majority of patients with panic disorder have co-existent symptomatology
of another psychiatric disease, delegates attending Tuesday.'s satellite
meeting were told. Only 20-30% of patients have pure uncomplicated panic
disorder.<BR>
Panic disorder is associated with agoraphobia in 60% of patients, depression
in 30% of patients and other anxiety disorders in 20% of patients.<BR>
&quot;The substantial overlap of symptoms in anxiety and depressive disorders
can present diagnosis and treatment dilemmas for the clinician,&quot; explained
Professor Julien Mendlewicz from the H&ocirc;pital Erasme, Brussels, Belgium.
<BR>
The lifetime occurrence of major depression in patients with panic disorder
is 30-50%. &quot;In many cases the depressive symptoms may appear after
the anxiety symptoms, but in a number of patients major depression can precede
the onset of panic disorder or occur simultaneously,&quot; he continued.<BR>
Patients who have panic disorder and depression may have more severe symptoms
and a greater functional impairment. &quot;This can create additional challenges
for treatment,&quot; Professor Mendlewicz said.<BR>
The seriousness of complicated panic disorder is evident when the incidence
of attempted suicides is examined. Between 20% and 29% of patients with
panic disorder and depression attempt suicide, compared with 13% of patients
with depression only and 5-7% of patients with panic disorder alone. <BR>

<H1>Reawakening interest in neurosurgery for mental disorders</H1>
<H2>Thursday symposium: Neurosurgery for mental disorders in the Decade
of the Brain: current ethical, clinical and scientific issues.</H2>
&quot;With the recognition that some patients with affective, obsessional
or anxiety disorders prove refractory even to extensive and intensive treatment
efforts and remain extremely disabled, interest in neurosurgery for mental
disorders (NMD) has reawakened,&quot; says Professor Per Mindus from the
Department of Psychiatry, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Today's
session on NMD - chaired by Professor Mindus - promises to be a lively update
on &quot;psychiatry's most strikingly brain-centred and controversial treatment
modality.&quot; 
<H3>Consider neurosurgery in OCD non-responders</H3>
Neurosurgery should be considered in a select group of patients with obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), particularly those who are &quot;non-responders
and those whose quality of life, due to impairment caused by the disorder,
is extremely poor,&quot; explains Dr Joseph Zohar from the Division of Psychiatry,
Chaim Sheba Medical Centre, Tel-Hashoner, Israel. &quot;About 10-20% of
OCD patients are refractory to all pharmacological, behavioural and family
intervention,&quot; says Dr Zohar. 
<H3>What does the future of psychosurgical procedures hold? </H3>
&quot;More selective and reversible methods of modifying prefrontal cortex
(PFC) function, coupled with advances in functional brain imaging, are likely
to replace current psychosurgical procedures,&quot; according to Dr Laurie
Geffen from the Psychiatry Department, University of Queensland, Brisbane,
Australia. Dr Geffen is presenting a paper this morning on the functional
neuroanatomy of the PFC. Dr Geffen predicts that methods such as transmagnetic
stimulation and receptor-specific drugs will be increasingly used. 
<H3>NMD - &quot;small but important&quot; role</H3>
&quot;NMD has a small but important place in the management of severe psychiatric
disorders,&quot; says Dr Perminder Sachdev from the Neuropsychiatric Institute,
Prince Henry Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Although there is no consensus
on the duration of illness before NMD should be used, two years for depression
and five years for OCD is likely to be appropriate, adds Dr Sachdev. <BR>

current ethical, clinical and scientific issues is in room B5 at 1330-1600

<H1>Quitting smoking may trigger relapse of major depression</H1>
<H2>Thursday symposium: Ferno symposium on nicotine.</H2>
Individuals with a history of depression who quit smoking may have their
illness return, says Dr Alexander Glassman from the College of Physicians
and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, USA. In Dr Glassman's study
of 300 smokers, almost 20% who had a history of depression experienced a
bout of major depression after they successfully ceased smoking. &quot;The
question becomes whether depressive symptoms are transient like other withdrawal
symptoms, or whether smoking cessation can lead to serious or prolonged
episodes of major depression,&quot; observes Dr Glassman. 
<H3>Cerebral blood flow changes in nicotine withdrawal </H3>
The irritability and inability to concentrate experienced by people attempting
to give up smoking may be partly due to changes in the regional cerebral
blood flow (rCBF). Dr Martin Ingvar from the Department of Clinical Neuroscience,
Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, this morning is presenting the results
of a study of habitual smokers who performed a cognitive task (perceptual
maze test) while abstaining from smoking. &quot;Specific rCBF increases
were observed during abstinence compared with during nicotine infusion,&quot;
summarises Dr Ingvar. 
<H3>Dopamine release may contribute to nicotine dependence <BR>
in schizophrenia </H3>
Behavioural sensitisation after chronic nicotine treatment in rats is accompanied
by enhanced dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, which is similar
to the effect of atypical, but not typical, antipsychotic drugs, according
to Dr Torgny Svensson from the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology,
Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. &quot;This phenomenon may contribute
to nicotine dependence in schizophrenia,&quot; says Dr Svensson. <BR>
The Ferno symposium on nicotine is in room B3 at 1330-1600 today. <BR>

<H1>New evidence for familial transmission of anxiety disorder comorbid
with alcoholism</H1>
<H2>Wednesday symposium: Genetics and alcoholism.</H2>
Comorbid disorders should be examined in patients when trying to elucidate
the complex mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholism, according
to Dr Kathleen Merikangas from Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven,
USA. In a study of 1,053 first degree relatives of 224 probands selected
from both clinical settings and the community, Dr Merikangas found that
alcoholism was associated with anxiety disorders, and that the transmission
of alcohol dependence was much greater than that of alcohol abuse. Alcoholism
associated with anxiety disorders was higher among female relatives, while
the transmission of alcohol dependence was higher among male relatives.
<H3>Self-medication in alcoholism co-morbid with social phobia</H3>
While social phobia and alcoholism were transmitted independently, there
was evidence of links between panic disorder and alcoholism. Dr Merikangas'
findings support a self-medication hypothesis for alcoholism comorbid with
social phobia. Panic may either precipitate the development of alcoholism
or alcoholism could potentiate the expression of panic in susceptible individuals.

<H1>Welcome from Glasgow - <BR>
host to the XXIst CINP Congress</H1>
<BR>
<BR>
The XXIst CINP Congress will be held from 12-16 July 1998 in Glasgow, the
gateway to one of the most beautiful countries in the world.<BR>
The natural grandeur and historic splendour of &quot;Glaschu&quot; (the
dear green place) and its surrounds will superbly complement the high quality
scientific content of the CINP Congress.<BR>
In particular the XXIst CINP Congress welcomes new, young researchers into
the world of CINP. Working with the theme The Young Delegate, conference
organisers have designed an all inclusive conference package for young investigators.
Psychopharmacologists who will be under 40 years of age in January 1998
can enter The Glasgow Young Psychopharmacologists Competition. Finalists
will receive a package to attend the Congress and the winner will receive
the major financial prize of $5,000.<BR>
In accordance with views expressed at previous congresses, the number of
parallel sessions has been reduced to approximately 60. A series of Primary
Care/Psychiatry symposia and Latest Research symposia have also been introduced
to the Congress proceedings. These will have a late registration date because
of their innovative nature.<BR>
The XXIst CINP Congress promises to be one of the best yet, so make it a
date at CINP Glasgow in 1998. <BR>
