CELL THERAPEUTICS REPORTS NOVEL THERAPY
FOR ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

Researchers at Seattle-based Cell Therapeutics, Inc. have
reported the results of a double-blinded pilot study of
lisofylline, showing the drug may be effective in treating
patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS,
and multiple organ failure associated with systemic
infections. ARDS is a condition that affects nearly 350,000
Americans and is responsible for 170,000 deaths each year.

The scientists also presented data showing they were able to
predict patients at risk for the illness and that the
predictive value correlated with its severity.

ARDS is untreatable and represents the largest cause of
morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple traumatic
injuries. The condition is a form of lung damage often found
in patients whose lungs are injured by the systemic
inflammatory response following traumatic injury, severe blood
infections such as sepsis, or other systemic illness. Another
subset of patients at extreme risk for ARDS includes cancer
patients receiving high-dose radiation therapy or
chemotherapy.

"Based on the results of our pilot studies and the breadth of
our pre-clinical data, lisofylline may increase the efficacy
and reduce the cost of trauma care by significantly shortening
the length of hospital stay and recuperation time," said
James A. Bianco, M.D., president and chief executive officer
of Cell Therapeutics, Inc.

The company's researchers have previously reported a link
between the production of phosphatidic acid (PA) and the
oxidative damage to lung and other organs seen in ARDS. PA is
a fat-like chemical messenger generated by the cell membrane
in response to cell injury caused by a form of highly reactive
oxygen. They hypothesized that since lisofylline inhibits PA
formation, the small-molecule drug would decrease cell
susceptibility to oxidative damage and reduce the lung leak
observed in ARDS patients.

In a pilot study, Stuart L. Bursten, M.D., Ph.D., principal
scientist at Cell Therapeutics, Inc., and co-workers measured
the ratio of certain free fatty acids (FFA) - chemical
by-products of PA metabolism - found in the blood. They found
that the increase in the ratio of the fatty acids predicted
which patients would develop the syndrome and that the
predictive value correlated with the severity of the illness.

FFA levels in serum of 39 healthy control subjects were
measured and retrospectively compared to the FFA serum levels
in 30 patients who had developed sepsis, trauma or ARDS within
24 hours of serum sampling. Of these 30 patients, 13 were at
risk for ARDS but did not develop the syndrome, seven patients
at risk for ARDS did develop the condition, and 10 patients
had ARDS on admission to the study.

The serum samples from all 30 ARDS patients had significantly
elevated ratios of specific serum FFA (i.e., oleate plus
lineolate : palmitate) compared to healthy control subjects
(p < 0.01).

The researchers then conducted a 13-patient, randomized
placebo-controlled pilot study of lisofylline in patients with
life-threatening infections and multiple organ failure who
were at risk for ARDS. None of the six patients who received
lisofylline died, while three out of seven patients in
the non-treatment group did. In addition, the FFA (acyl chain)
ratio for the lisofylline-treated patients was significantly
lower than the placebo control group (1.21 and 1.46
respectively, p = 0.02).

"We found that the calculated ratios of serum free-fatty
acids increased and predicted the development of ARDS in these
at-risk patients," said Dr. Bursten. "The data points to the
acyl chain ratio as being of clinical utility in predicting
ARDS and may be a valuable tool in monitoring treatment."

Lisofylline is in final stages of Phase II clinical testing
of its ability to accelerate blood-cell recovery following
oxidative stress and the cell-membrane damage that occurs from
radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Clinical results have
shown that chemotherapy-treated patients undergoing bone-
marrow transplantation and treated with lisofylline experience
a rapid recovery of white blood cells, red blood cells and
platelets.

The novel therapeutic also has been shown to protect other
tissues and major organs from the otherwise toxic effects of a
number of anticancer agents, including interleukin-2 (IL-2).
Cell Therapeutics is in discussions with several potential
corporate partners to conduct Phase Ill clinical trials of
lisofylline for ARDS following multiple trauma.

Cell Therapeutics; Inc., is a privately held, Seattle-based
pharmaceutical company developing a new class of drugs that
selectively regulate the metabolism of phosphatidic acid, an
abnormal intracellular pathway expressed in cancer, immune
diseases and other life-threatening conditions.

MICROCIDE AND DAIICHI FORM PARTNERSHIP
TO SOLVE PROBLEM IN ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE

Microcide Pharmaceuticals, Inc., of Mountain View, CA, and
Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.  have signed a joint research
agreement to discover and develop drugs that will overcome the
efflux pump (drug export) mechanism of resistance used by
Pseudomonas and other bacteria to thwart the effectiveness of
current antibiotic therapies.

Under the three-year agreement, Daiichi will receive
worldwide rights to products emerging from the research
effort. Initial products of the partnership are expected to be
antibiotic-potentiating agents, which would be used together
with existing antibiotics. The potentiating agents would
interfere with the bacterial drug export system, thereby
increasing drug concentrations within the bacterium to levels
sufficient to kill otherwise-resistant organisms. The
collaboration may also produce agents which are themselves
antibiotics, acting directly to kill bacteria through
inhibition of the efflux mechanism.

Microcide will receive research funding of $10 million over 3
years and multiple milestone payments for products developed
under the agreement. Microcide will also receive royalties on
worldwide sales and has retained co-promotion rights in North
America for products developed by the partners.

Jim Rurka, president and chief executive officer of
Microcide, said, "Daiichi has a formidable research,
development and commercialization track record in the
infectious disease sector, especially with regard to leading
quinolone agents. They are the ideal partner for this
Microcide technology, because they have acquired unparalleled
expertise on the antibiotic side of the bacterial efflux
resistance equation."

The companies will each contribute research personnel and
complementary technologies to the discovery and development
program, with work-plan activities being conducted in both
Mountain View and Tokyo. A joint research committee will
manage the collaboration.

The efflux pump mechanism has been identified as an important
factor in the growing problem of bacterial drug resistance.
Described as energy-driven and membrane- associated, it works
by pumping antibiotics, including quinolones, out of a
bacterial cell, reducing the concentration of drug at the
target site of action. Quinolones are anti-infective compounds
that inhibit the activity of DNA gyrase, an enzyme necessary
for bacterial growth. Most fluoroquinolones are readily
absorbed, making them effective treatments for systemic
infections. The worldwide market for quinolones totals
approximately $2.5 billion.

This collaboration marks the second significant transaction
concluded between Microcide and a major pharmaceutical company
in the past month. On October 25, Microcide announced its
first corporate partnership in the form of a multi-year
collaborative agreement with Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals, a
division of Johnson & Johnson, to develop therapeutic
compounds for Grain-positive bacterial infections.
Microcide's corporate strategy calls for similar arrangements
in the future in order to accelerate development of its novel
antibiotic discoveries, and to provide a strong financial
support base for the company.

Microcide Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a privately held
biopharmaceutical company founded to address the emerging
market by increasing prevalence of bacterial resistance,
growth of at-risk populations and decreased research efforts
in this arena. The company is focusing on the host-pathogen
relationship and has taken a genetic approach in its
technology designed to generate novel product leads. Its
initial chemistry driven efforts are aimed at discovery and
development of new antibiotics for institutionally-acquired
bacterial infections or infections where currently available
treatments are ineffective or inadequate.

Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. is a major Japanese ethical
drugs maker. The company markets drugs to all bacterial
infections, hepatitis, cancer, thrombosis,
hypercholesterolemia and ulcers, and contrast medium.
Development efforts center around quinolones, anti-clotting
agents, cardiovascular drugs and imaging contrast agents. The
company's sales for fiscal 1994 exceeded $2 billion.

CORTECS REPORTS POSITIVE PRELIMINARY RESULTS
FOR "PSEUDOSAT" ORAL VACCINE AGAINST PSEUDOMONAS

Cortecs International (NASDAQ:DLVRY/ LSE:COR.UASX:CRI), of
London, England, has announced the preliminary results of its
Phase I/II study in bronchiectasis of Pseudostate, its oral
vaccine against pseudomonas infection of the lung, which the
company commenced in March 1995. Analysis of the total results
is continuing and there should be more to report early in
1996.

The preliminary analysis shows that, after oral vaccination,
these patents exhibited a specific immune response through a
type of white blood cell called "T" cells, which enables these
cells to seek out and destroy the invading bacteria.

Also in this study, there was observed a several-fold
reduction in white cell content of the sputum (white cells in
sputum reflect the severity of infection, "pus" in sputum
predominantly consists of dead white cells).  Oral Pseudostat
was given at intervals during 56 days and a progressive
improvement in responses was observed. Within 28 days of
discontinuing treatment the white cells in sputum were rising
again.

This open phase I/II study was carried out in Newcastle, NSW,
Australia at Cortecs' Australian Institute for Mucosal
Immunology, (AIMI) in 10 patients with bronchiectasis (a
disease of the lungs in which the structure of the bronchi,
the tubes lining the lungs, is distorted so that bronchial
secretions cannot easily be expelled and then become infected
and very difficult to treat.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the organism responsible for 90% of
the deaths in cystic fibrosis patients who usually become
colonized in early childhood. Antibiotics become less
effective as lung damage progresses and there are currently no
vaccines available. These results indicate the viability of an
oral vaccine for the prevention of respiratory infection with
pseudomonas in patients with serious respiratory diseases
such as cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis and
bronchiectasis.

This oral vaccine is being developed for the management of
these diseases and Phase 11 trials in both cystic fibrosis and
chronic bronchitis are scheduled to begin in 1996.

BIOTECHNOLOGY PARTNERS WITH HMO'S TO BOOST BOTTOM LINE

Biotechnology companies are increasingly teaming up with
managed care organizations to help them finance growth,
leverage technology, and market products, according to a KPMG
Peat Marwick industry guide book, "Blueprint for Growth:
Building the Biotechnology Business."

Industry restructuring, including new alliances between
biotech and managed care companies, is a key finding in the
83-page KPMG industry guide book, which creates a profile of a
complex industry in the process of self renewal. Based on
survey data collected from 374 biotech executives, the guide
book provides a prescription for industry growth. For copies
of the KPMG report, contact Anna Le Goff, KPMG national life
sciences at (800)330-KPMG or via FAX at (609)896-2968.

According to the guide book, managed care providers will
account for 90 percent of the prescription drug customers in
the United States by the turn of the century. Although this
linkage between biotech companies and managed care
organizations has yet to be fully embraced by the industry,
some progressive biotechs have joined forces with HMO's.

Collaborations make sense for both parties, according to
Robert S. Esposito, national director of biotechnology and
life sciences for KPMG Peat Marwick's Health Care & Life
Sciences Practice. Biotechnology companies are affected by
the health care environment emphasis on providing care more
efficiently and more cost-effectively; an emphasis that is
even morepronouncedinthemanagedcarearea.

Biotechnology companies can fulfill that joint requirement by
developing a product that can, for example, eliminate a
costly procedure or reduce a hospital stay due to its
efficacy. The challenge is for those companies to build
efficiencies into their product development process that will
help reduce the burden of their R&D costs on the bottom line.

HMO's and other health care payers have access to billions of
investment dollars; biotech companies need partners to fund
drug development programs. "HMO's combined have in excess $35
billion in reserves available for investment," Esposito says,
"which is more money in the aggregate than the major
pharmaceutical companies," he points out. Pharmaceutical
companies have historically provided biotech inns with an
important source of equity and revenue streams. Some 61
percent of the biotech companies responding to a KPMG survey
have licensed technology to drug companies in exchange for
cash and a future royalty stream.

This year marked a significant turnaround in the biotech
industry, according to Esposito. "It is the first time that
revenue units (premiums) are not going to increase faster
than the rate of inflation. Clearly, biotechnology products
have to be incrementally efficacious; but they're also going
to have to be cheaper," said Esposito.

Pharmacoeconomic studies, conducted as early in the
development process as possible, will become more important in
bringing drugs to market, Esposito predicts. "If they don't
conduct these studies," Esposito cautions, "companies run the
risk of losing out to the competition on what may have been a
breakthrough therapy." Esposito adds, "Pharmaceuticals are
going to be used increasingly in a very different way. Key to
that is pharmacoeconomics. These studies will be critical for
HMO's for the next five years or so."

Pharmacoeconomic studies are developed with one overriding
objective: cost effectiveness. "Biotech companies have to make
their drugs compelling and to be ahead of the competition in
order to make a solid pharmacoeconomic argument; not just a
better drug or that it has a higher cure rate. Instead, the
company must be able to support its product by stating it will
save the system money versus some alternative drugs or no-drug
therapies."

Those companies that incorporate pharmacoeconomic studies in
preclinical trials will be positioned substantially better to
meet changing market trends, including increasing competition.
"Plus," said Esposito, "HMO's will list those drugs on their
formularies. That's a marketing reality."

The KPMG survey data report that about 64 percent of
companies in clinical trials made an effort to conduct
pharmacoeconomic studies before they launched their product.
The use of such studies is on the rise. The number of
pharmacoeconomic studies per company rose from 1.7 in 1988
to 23.7 in 1994, according to the guide book.

The publication's other findings describe an industry in
transition. They include the following:

* The emergence of a new industry structure based on customer
focus in product development. Although nearly 9 in I *
executives (89 percent) report that they are focused on
creating breakthrough therapies, a traditional business
strategy, companies realize that mastering the clinical
approval process is key to future development.

* Steady industry growth, despite recent downsizing. Between
1990 and 1993, the average number of employees at a company
rose from 62 to 99. The average amount of space occupied rose
from 30,150 square feet to 56,661 square feet.

* Recruitment and competitive compensation are the two most
challenging human resource issues. Companies are out-sourcing
functions such as money management, regulatory affairs, legal
counsel, and facility compliance to remain as lean as
possible.

* The year 1994, while one of the dimmest years for equity
financing, also saw companies focused on raising capital. Some
70 percent of survey respondents report that senior management
and business development teams are actively marketing their
technologies to investors. Moreover, the marketing process is
beginning earlier.

KPMG Peat Marwick LLP is the U.S. practice of KPMG, the
Global Leader among professional services firms.

Worldwide, KPMG has more than 6,000 partners as well as
67,000 professionals serving clients in more than 134
countries. In the United States, KPMG delivers a wide range

ENCOURAGING STUDY RESULTS REPORTED
ON PHASE 2 HEPATITIS C CLINICAL
TRIALS WITH NATURAL ALPHA INTERFERON

Interferon Sciences, Inc.  (NASDAQ-IFSC), of New Brunswick,
NJ, has announced preliminary results from two phase 2
clinical trials utilizing the Company's injectable, natural-
source, multispecies alpha interferon ("Natural Alpha
Interferon") in patients chronically infected with hepatitis
C virus. These results were presented by Dr. D. M. Simon of
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, and
Dr. S. C. Gordon of William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak,
Michigan, at the annual meeting of the American Association
for the Study of Liver Diseases. In the first of these multi-
centered, randomized, open-label dose-ranging trials, 66
patients previously untreated were studied.  The second trial
studied 63 patients who had previously been treated
unsuccessfully with recombinant alpha interferon.

The preliminary results of these phase 2 studies are
encouraging and clearly justify additional studies to further
explore and define the potential use of Natural Alpha
Interferon in treating patients with hepatitis C.

Chronic viral hepatitis is a liver infection caused by
various hepatitis viruses. The United States Centers for
Disease Control estimates that approximately 2 to 3 million
people in the United States are presently infected with the
hepatitis C virus ("HCV').

MONSANTO TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING ITS BIOTECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS

Biotechnology will be a primary source of future income for
Monsanto Company according to new corporate analysis prepared
by The Freedonia Group, Inc. (Cleveland,Ohio). Analyst Lois
Krebs remarks that half of the products under development in
1994 were agricultural or pharmaceutical products derived from
genetic engineering. In the future, genetically engineered
products are expected to comprise a much larger proportion of
sales in the Agricultural Group. Although this group accounted
for only 27 percent of the company's total sales in 1994, it
contributed the largest share of operating income and is
Monsanto's fastest-growing group. The company expects the
Agricultural Group's sales to increase 20 percent annually
for the foreseeable future. These, and strategic developments
in all of Monsanto's other product groups, are analyzed fully
in the new corporate intelligence report C68, MONSANTO
COMPANY.

Monsanto, which is the fourth-largest chemical firm in the
US, manufactures agricultural chemicals, genetically
engineered plants, fibers, plastics, performance chemicals,
pharmaceuticals, artificial sweeteners and food additives. The
report looks at the Company's strategy to remain a market
leader in many of its present businesses through studied
acquisitions and divestitures. One such move discussed in the
study is the February 1995 acquisition of food additives
producer Kelco from Merck & Company, which complements many
other Monsanto business lines, particularly biotechnology for
applications in agricultural, pharmaceutical, performance
chemical and food additive products.

The complete 170-page study C68, MONSANTO COMPANY is
available for $1200.00 from The Freedonia Group, Inc., 3570
Warrensville Center Rd., Ste. 201, Cleveland, Ohio
44122-5226. For further details,  call (216)921-6800 or fax at
