Is DirecTv phenomenon destined for Europe?

The sense of anticipation is palpable. With only weeks to go until two of
Europe's TV giants - CLT and Canal+ - take the bull by the horns and launch
digital services, 1996 could be the year digital TV at last becomes a
reality in Europe.

In the last six months, digital has shifted from being a theoretical,
almost futuristic concept, to a viable business opportunity - maybe even a
necessity. The model in all this is the U.S., where DirecTv and Primestar
have triumphed beyond all expectations, to the extent that digital
satellite television (DST) in the U.S. is now seen as the first genuine
threat to cable's multichannel dominance.

This lesson was rammed home in a fiercely bullish report from SBC Warburg
in December which argued that the success of DirecTv in particular had
transformed the business case for digital satellite. Two examples stand
out: DirecTv's success in pay-per-view, and the potential for
satellite-delivered online services.

DirecTv has resuscitated the comatose PPV market in the U.S., thanks to
more channels (70+), impulse ordering and user-friendly onscreen guides. At
3.78 per month, buy rates are five to six times those achieved by cable
MSOs. The average monthly spend by subscribers on PPV is $17.44 (Primestar,
with more big ticket events and higher prices, generates $32.73 a month).

In Warburg's words, that potentially makes PPV a "really significant
generator of business for BSkyB and Canal+." Warburg's BSkyB valuation
model projects PPV revenues in 2002 of #100 million ($155 million), but its
analysts now reckon this could be too low "by a factor of five times."

Equally significant is the potential appeal of interactive services off
satellite. Using a telephone line as the upstream, digital satellites could
deliver Internet access at more than 30 times the speed of a full
phone-line service. Hughes, the owner of DirecTv, already offers a similar
service in the U.S., DirecPC. In Europe, Kinnevik plans to deliver
satellite online services in Scandinavia this year.

The message is clear. Digital satellite, for so long a mysterious,
uncertain business case for analog pay TV operators terrified of destroying
their existing businesses, in fact holds huge potential. Cable operators
may have to face up to the fact that digital satellite can do almost as
much as their expensive fiber-based wired systems can.



1996: Europe's digital year?

Players in terrestrial TV, cable, satellite, publishing and film all
harbor digital TV aspirations. But in Europe, labyrinthine cross-holdings
and non-competition clauses muddy the waters. Some companies have struck
technological and corporate alliances that tidy up the sector in
preparation for the shift to digital - but many more are needed.

For instance, Germany's Kirch Group has abandoned its unilateral digital
decoder system, the "D-box", and joined the list of companies signing up
for MediaGuard, the digital decoder developed by Bertelsmann and Canal+.
From the moment Deutsche Telekom, which controls 90% of German cable
subscribers, chose MediaGuard, Kirch's surrender became inevitable.

A similar kind of inevitability hangs over the future of CLT's digital
plans, particularly in France. Bertelsmann, News Corp., Havas and Walt
Disney were reported as likely buyers, or at least partners, of the
Luxembourg broadcasting giant, which has plans for digital services in
France and Germany.

The reason for those rumors is simple. In France, a CLT digital package
would compete with a similar planned package from Canal+. The two companies
share a common shareholder, Havas, that is unlikely to fund competing
digital services, nor see Canal+ damaged by a rival service.

Most likely, CLT will either join up with Canal+, or Havas will sell its
stake in CLT to another buyer. In this context, the business logic behind
the rumors about CLT's future is compelling. When added to the
near-certainty that BSkyB has European ambitions, and the best way to
fulfill these ambitions will be in digital satellite, a News Corp. link-up
looks convincing. But Bertelsmann is not likely to countenance an
infringement on its own territory - hence its connection with CLT. tv

Rewe joins Pro 7 to crank up German TV money machine

On the back of unprecedented commercial broadcasting growth, Germany
ushered in the new year with a brand new TV player. Rewe AG, the country's
largest supermarket and discount retail group, took a 40% stake in
fifth-ranked German network Pro Sieben (Pro 7).

Rewe's entry into the TV market may be only the first maneuver in a
process of financial retrenchment and, possibly, consolidation in Europe's
largest TV market. Germany is preparing to quadruple the size of that
market for the second time in 10 years, with the advent of digital TV. It's
also dealing with probable regulatory change and a likely medium-term
slowdown in an advertising market that has been up, up, up for the best
part of a decade.

Cologne-based Rewe's investment in Pro 7 takes some of the heat off Leo
Kirch and his son Thomas - for years they have been accused of playing hard
and fast with ownership ceilings thanks to Kirch pere's numerous
investments.

Pro 7's new alliance, and a planned public stock offering, should dispel
accusations that the broadcaster is unofficially controlled by Leo through
Thomas. Rewe spokesman Wolfram Schumck says the new partner has no concrete
plans with Pro 7 just yet: "We have to get to know each other first."

Rewe massive revenues (DM46 billion ($32 billion) in 1994) will add strong
backing to Pro 7's mission to compete with the other four "major" German
networks - state networks ARD and ZDF and commercial giants RTL and SAT 1 -
in a world of digital channels and fragmentation.

For Rewe, diversifying into commercial TV is in line with board chairman
Hans Reischl's strategy of "investing in promising future markets." Pro 7
anticipates revenues of DM1.45 billion in 1995, with pre-tax profits of
about DM200 million, making it the most profitable network in Germany, with
operating margins in excess of 17%. According to Pro 7 spokesman Torsten
Rossmann, Rewe won't participate directly in financing acquisition of
rights and production costs, "but as a strong shareholder, [it] will
facilitate obtaining bank credits."

The Rewe announcement came soon after Pro Sieben Television's official
conversion into an AG (joint stock company) in anticipation of a summer
1996 public flotation of 35% of the company. The conversion reduces Thomas
Kirch's stake to 24.5% and liquidates the 49.5% stake held by Gerhard
Ackermans.

Pro 7's initial public offering will be a German TV first, offering a
desirable investment vehicle. Pro 7 expects the listing to raise DM300
million. Analysts at London brokerage SBC Warburg have initially valued the
free float in the range of DM700-DM900 million. Prior to the listing, two
businesses may be divested: the film and TV production arm (to be taken
over by Thomas Kirch and Pro 7 MD Georg Kofler) and home shopping channel
H.O.T.

Rewe sources say the price for its stake is well in excess of DM60
million. Assuming Pro 7 maintains annual revenue growth of 8-10% over the
next two years, SBC Warburg's preliminary valuation is in line with
multiples at similar European TV companies such as France's M6 and TF1 and
the UK's HTV and Scottish TV.



Market prospects

With almost 30 terrestrial and cable services available, the German TV
market is the most developed in Europe, even though TV's share of the
advertising market (at $4 billion gross, 20% of the total) still has room
to grow.

German TV's share of total spend is only half the level of that in Spain.
Germany boasts 32.4 million TV homes, 15.6 million of them connected to
cable - a primary reception vehicle for many commercial channels. Since
1990, the number of channels has grown from four to 15.

A concerted effort on the part of most commercial channels to attract
middle market and youth viewers has driven up program costs, both for local
fare and imports. Rights values skyrocketed in 1995, spurred by commercial
TV leader RTL, which forked out $250 million to snatch a Warner Bros.
package from under the nose of the Kirch Group. The deal included TV rights
to 44 prime feature films.

In November, Kirch fought back and stumped up $30 million for German TV
rights to a Steven Spielberg package that included mega-hits Jurassic Park
and E.T. The bid broke all previous payment levels for single film titles.
Public broadcaster ARD separately bought TV options on all properties from
new Spielberg vehicle DreamWorks through the end of the decade.

Whether the channels can sustain such prices is unclear. Efforts to boost
in-house production have brought mixed results at RTL. Pro 7 has stepped up
to the domestic production plate, spending DM400 million in 1995 on its own
TV films and enhanced news coverage. Pro 7's total program budget for 1996
stands at DM1 billion.

Short-term growth in the German TV ad market is likely to sustain the
existing setup, with regulators rather than cash-strapped advertisers
driving investments. In spite of a sluggish 1995 economy, TV advertising
was buoyant last year, with growth estimated at 11% (having jumped nearly
16% in 1994). Zenith Media reckons 1996 will be equally healthy, with TV
forecast to generate over DM6.9 billion.

But not all broadcasters are sanguine about the medium-term: "The
advertising boom is over," says Rossmann. "Growth will be less and
competition harder."

One factor is a growing stable of niche channels fighting over this TV ad
pie. On top of that, the role of the regulator remains unclear. Germany's
law-makers have played kingmaker in the last 10 years, in the face of a
virtual TV "triopoly" - Bertelsmann, Kirch and CLT.

In October 1995, federal regulators drafted rules on channel ownership,
whereby one company will be allowed to control up to 30% of total viewing,
regardless of the number of channels owned. Kirch already takes 29.5% of
the audience; Bertelsmann controls just under 20% and CLT, 22.7%. In
anticipation of the 1997 enforcement of the new rules, 1996 could see the
first phase of channel ownership consolidation.

Digital, however, could significantly alter the competitive balance,
putting Pro 7 and the other "second division" channels in a position to
launch their own stables of channels. Pro 7 has five transponders booked on
Astra's digital satellites 1F and 1G, and should be well-positioned to
expand into pay offerings. tv

Dutch print moves to buy up channels

Two Dutch publishers are buying into TV channels. Dutch bank Mees Pierson
is handling "serious" negotiations between Scandinavian Broadcasting
System's SBS6 and Dutch daily paper De Telegraaf. The newspaper wants a 35%
stake in SBS6 as a springboard for future projects like online services;
SBS6 wants a Dutch backer to solidify its local image. SBS6 wants to buy
HMG's channel RTL-5, but is reportedly offering well below the asking price.
Dutch regional publisher Wegener is close to gaining 100% control of
Arcade Entertainment's three TV channels, radio, music, video and film
retail operation, worth $500 million a year.

ExpressVu and Power/DirecTv have received licenses to broadcast digital

ExpressVu and Power/DirecTv have received licenses to broadcast digital
DTH services into Canada, offering distinct competition to the country's
cable sector for the first time. At the same time, Canadian MSOs - led by
Shaw Communications - were refused a license for their own DTH service,
Homestar.

ExpressVu is owned by BCE Inc. (the parent company of telco Bell Canada)
and broadcaster Western International Communications, among others.
Power/DirecTv is 80%-owned by Canada's Power Corp. and 20% by
DirecTv/Hughes Electronics Corp. The new DTH services will provide as many
as 70 channels of pay-per-view programming, in addition to traditional
services; both services will launch in 1996.

Five new DTH PPV programming services were also licensed, including a new
sports/special events service backed by the CTV Television Network, and
separate movies/special events services from Power/DirecTv itself, Viewer's
Choice/Home Theater and Canal Premiere.

Because there will be competition between the two services, regulatory
body the CRTC will not regulate their rates. Like cable, the new DTH
services will be subject to certain requirements in terms of basic service,
maintenance of Canadian services and open access for all programming
services. They must contribute 5% of their annual gross revenues to funds
that support Canadian program production.

In a nod to increased competition, the CRTC will consider applications for
future DTH services six months after the two new services are launched,
offering a possible second chance to Homestar.

Report round-up

Interactive cable TV will reach only reach 4.6 million Asia Pacific homes
by 2005, according to a report from UK consultants Ovum. In Interactive
Television: The Market Opportunity, Ovum forecasts that 26.4 million
households in the U.S. and 23.1 million in Europe will have cable access to
interactive TV in 10 years.

Cash flow will still be negative in Asia Pacific in 2005 as a result of
the low penetration, but will be positive in Europe by 2002. Interactive TV
will generate $4.31 billion in advertising revenues in Europe and $782
million in Asia Pacific in 2005: both are swamped by the U.S. figure of
$9.03 billion.

After two years of delays, revisions and in-fighting, the Spanish cable

After two years of delays, revisions and in-fighting, the Spanish cable
law was finally passed in the New Year. In the end, it included most of the
amendments demanded by the opposition Partido Popular. Despite that, the
opposition voted against. If the PP wins the election in March, the party
has vowed to change the law.

PP amendments in the bill include minimum and maximum franchise areas of
50,000 and 1.5 million people and a proposal that the second of the two
licenses to be awarded in each area will be decided by a commission
comprising central, regional and local government - a seeming recipe for
bureaucratic disaster.

Perhaps the most contentious part of the law - the automatic awarding of
the first license in each area to telco Telefonica - remains Telefonica has
already launched cable service via Cablevision, its joint venture with
Prisa, cabling 2,600 homes in Barcelona and starting operations in 16
cities. It offers a 40-channel package, including film channels TNT,
Cinemania, and Cine Clasico, and sports channels Teledeporte, Eurosport and
Esportmania (from Prisa).

The potential glitch for Cablevision is the clause in the new law that
forbids Telefonica from launching cable operations until nine months after
the second, commercial license is opened for bidding. Prisa maintains this
does not apply to cities where it has already started operations.

AB launches dawn raid on French digital

French TV production house AB Productions, owned by Claude Berda and
Jean-Luc Azoulay with annual revenues of FFr1 billion ($204.5 million), has
jumped the digital Gallic gun by launching its analog AB1 channel January 1
on Eutelsat II F1. AB also announced plans for a 30-channel digital,
encrypted bouquet with nine channels to be running by February.

AB hopes to sign up at least one cable operator by the end of January at a
price of around FFr2.50 per subscriber per month.

A French government-commissioned report on the future of satellite TV,
published January 4, suggests it is time state-owned France Telecom
acknowledges it cannot compete with Astra and Eutelsat in the DTH market
and abandons its third generation of satellites.

Murdoch bids for Olympic European TV rights

Rupert Murdoch's latest raid on sports rights is aimed at the most sacred
prize of all - the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee says a
consortium led by News Corp. has submitted a "serious bid" for European TV
rights to all Olympic events between 2000 and 2008. Reportedly, the bid is
worth more than $2 billion.

News Corp. has been a mammoth sports rights buyer in the UK, the U.S.,
Asia and Australia. For the past 12 months, the company has been developing
its international sports assets, with News Corp. subsidiary Fox and cable
giant TCI merging their sports channel interests.

News Corp.'s main competitor for the Olympics will be the European
Broadcasting Union, which represents many of Europe's TV networks. Snapping
up long-term Olympic rights is becoming fashionable - U.S. network NBC
practically locked up U.S. broadcast and cable rights to the Olympics until
2008, for $2.3 billion.

Advertising


TV2 monopoly broken
The Norwegian parliament has ended the advertising monopoly held by
national commercial channel TV2. The government had previously outlawed the
use of programming from SBS-owned satellite channel TV Norge by regional
terrestrial broadcasters, since it put TV Norge in direct competition for
advertising with TV2. The government has now allowed the redistribution of
TV Norge's programming. TV2 plans to sue the government for $100 million in
damages from lost ad revenues .

UK cable ads up
UK cable and satellite TV ad revenues are predicted to jump 25% in 1996,
according to a report from merchant bank Goldman Sachs. The sectors are
predicted to increase ad revenues to #171 million ($265.5 million), up from
#137 million in 1995. The total TV ad pie for 1996 is estimated at #2.39
billion.

Cable

UK plans viewing survey
Field work has begun for the UK cable TV industry's first dedicated survey
of audience viewing habits. The Cable Research Firm, representing UK MSOs,
has commissioned the survey, which is due for release in April.

l Brazilian MSO Net Brasil posted a 25% growth in subscribers, to 617,671,
in the three months to November 1995. Subscriber revenues were $23 million
for November, compared to $18 million in August. Net Brasil launched two
cable systems in southern Brazil in November.

l Nynex CableComms, the UK's second-largest cable MSO, announced it was
shedding staff by 10% amid a company restructuring. The move is being made
to cut costs.

Mexico opens telco bids
Mexico's Communications Secretariat has invited telephony license
applications from CATV operators. Operators satisfying the prerequisites
(published January 5) will receive approval within 120 days. Mexico's telco
market becomes fully deregulated from January 1, 1997.
Programming

Canada's Paragon deal
Paragon Entertainment Corporation has licensed its Handmade Films library,
including Withnail and I, Nuns on the Run and Time Bandits, to European
broadcaster CLT for French- and German-speaking Europe.

Bible big in Italy
The latest installment of the international co-production The Bible,
Moses, scored a massive 10 million-plus audience in Italy on its premiere.

GLA unveils channels
Following the launch of its Galaxy III-R satellite December 14, Hughes
Communications-led Galaxy Latin America unveiled 12 channels that will be
exclusive to the service when it launches later in 1996. Of Hughes' three
Latin equity partners, Venevision has pledged two channels; Brazil's TVA,
four; and Mexico's Multivision six. GLA will deliver a total of 192
channels.

l Mexico's TV Azteca and Venezuela's RCTV have agreed to co-produce a
telenovela early this year. Azteca is also negotiating to co-produce with
U.S. Latino web Telemundo.

Regulation

Foxtel finding delayed
A reported flood of information to Australia's competition watchdog, the
Australian Competition and Consumer Association, has delayed a decision on
the proposed merger between pay TV groups Australis Media and Foxtel -
although the merger is still thought to be going through.

l Iranian police raided 110 houses in Tehran, seizing banned satellite TV
equipment used to watch "corrupting" Western programs, according to local
papers. There are an estimated 250,000 satellite dishes in Iran, despite a
1995 edict ordering the dismantling of all-such equipment.

l In order to satisfy the European Commission's anti-cartel regulations,
Dutch producer Endemol Entertainment could pull out of HMG, the holding
company that owns RTL-4, Veronica and RTL-5, rather than reduce its stake
from 24% to 7.5% (the maximum allowed by European regulations). HMG backers
CLT, VNU and Veronica would each retain a one-third stake.

l The Brazilian Congress will formalize the guidelines for commercializing
the country's telecoms sector early in 1996. Regulations go before a
special congress in late-January (TVI, Dec. 11, 1995).

Satellite

PanAmSat's moves
Arianespace will launch PanAmSat's PAS-7 Indian Ocean Region satellite on
an Arianne-5 rocket in late 1997. The PAS-7 satellite will have 24 C-band
and 24 Ku-band transponders. PanAmSat expects to launch five additional
satellites by the end of 1997. PAS-3, the delayed Latin American bird, was
to launch January 12, while the PAS-6 Atlantic Ocean Region satellite is
earmarked for launch later in 1996.

l PanAmSat and British Telecom have united under a marketing umbrella to
boost combined business via the PAS-4 satellite, which provides coverage of
Africa, Asia, Europe, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. BT will
market PanAmSat capacity to users.

Finance

Videotron UK results
Cable television revenues for Videotron Holdings, the UK MSO owned by
Videotron and Bell Cablemedia, increased #1.6 million (30%) to #7 million
($10.9 million) for the first quarter of fiscal 1995, ending November 30,
1995, over the same period last year. Total revenues were #17.5 million,
with residential telephony revenues increasing 40% and business telephony
53%. CATV subscribers reached 114,000.

l UK broadcasting and media group Carlton Communications reported 12%
growth in annual revenues, to $2.43 billion, for the year to September
1995. The company's broadcasting business - which includes Carlton TV and
Central TV - accounted for $1.03 billion.

Africa

Zimbabwe opens up
The Zimbabwe government has agreed to allow private competition to its
Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation. An amended Broadcasting Act will be
published in 1996.

l New U.S. cable channel "BET on Jazz: The Cable Jazz Channel" will launch
on MultiChoice's digital African satellite service April 1.

EU helps Namibia
The European Union has pledged Ecu5 million ($6.6 million) to aid the
development of the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation. The EU money will be
used to expand NBC's transmission network and production facilities for
educational broadcasting.

Asia

Channel [V] in Thailand
Channel [V], the music channel owned by News Corp.'s Star TV announced the
establishment of a 24-hour music cable channel in Thailand. The channel
will be a premium, non-advertising service offered by wired cable MSO UTV
in cooperation with broadcaster BNT.

Sofres plans for China
French ratings and research group Sofres is discussing a joint venture to
establish a Chinese TV audience measurement system with China's Central
Viewers Survey & Consulting Center. Sofres hopes to have peoplemeters
installed by 1997.

l Singapore-based Channel KTV will launch a 24-hour karaoke channel via
PanAmSat's PAS-2 satellite in late February. The channel will carry
programs in Cantonese and Mandarin.

UK

Granada's man joins BSkyB
Stuart Prebble, currently controller of factual programming for ITV
Network Center, has been named chief executive of Granada Sky Broadcasting,
a joint venture with BSkyB that plans to launch eight satellite channels in
the UK in 1996, including archive channel Granada Gold Plus. BSkyB is
itself planning new channels in 1996, including an arts, an education, a
computer and a games channel - even before the company's planned digital
launch.

Canada

Tax credit tightened
Canada's film tax-shelter system has been replaced by a new tax credit
program with more stringent rules. Under the new program, only
Canadian-controlled companies can benefit from the credit.

CanWest bid blocked
A court ruling has stymied CanWest Global's takeover bid for TV and media
group Western International Communications. A Supreme Court judge in
British Columbia quashed an attempt to convert non-voting B shares into

One partner away from dual service dexterity, Argentine MSO goes fiber

"Wanted: investors with cash and experience in telecommunications
services: foreigners welcome." This may as well be the sign outside the
door at Argentine cable operator Video Cable Comunicacion this year. Telco
investment scouts looking south of the border for a well-placed growth
vehicle need look no further than Argentina's largest MSO.

VCC is Latin America's biggest MSO, closing 1995 with 623,400 subscribers,
about 12% of all Argentine subscribers.

VCC was the first Argentine MSO to close a deal with a foreign partner.
Continental Cablevision bought a 50% stake in late 1994 for $150 million -
yet VCC founder-owner Samuel Liberman retained control, which is why there
are no Continental executives stationed in Buenos Aires.

VCC's greatest asset is the geographic spread of its systems - mostly
acquired during a 1993-94 spree - that line a 400-mile industrial corridor
from Buenos Aires via Rosario to Cordoba.

The affluent business corridor generates about 75% of Argentina's GDP, and
if business telephony/data transmission fulfills its promise as the hot
growth center over the next 10 years, VCC is well-placed to take advantage
(rival MSO Multicanal is more widespread outside Buenos Aires, but has
lower penetration in the biggest provincial cities).

But much depends on how alliances shape up. VCC's assistant CEO Carlos
Pratola says that securing another partner - probably foreign - will be a
priority this year, to help develop its telephony business. The company
also aims to build up its Buenos Aires penetration from 50% to 60%.

Regulation remains the key variable. Argentina's telco duopoly, Telefonica
and Telecom, has the option of sacrificing state protection in November
1997 in exchange for permission to enter video services. But the MSOs are
seeking protection from the telcos through a new broadcast bill, soon to be
debated in congress. Argentina's cable operators are asking for a window of
several years to develop telephone services before the telcos muscle in on
their turf.



Despite being one of the most mature Latin cable markets, Argentina's
multichannel market continues to evolve. In 1993, massive consolidation
among the nation's 1,200 cable operators produced four dominant MSOs. In
late 1994, big investments by Continental Cablevision and TCI confirmed
that Argentina's $1.5 billion-a-year industry had enough growth potential
to lure the biggest players.

In 1995, as MSOs focused on standardizing operations among the systems
acquired in 1993-94, the first accord between a telco and an MSO hinted at
the shape of things to come: a converged landscape with a few multi-service
providers dominating the information industry.

By 2000 there may be just three road hogs jostling on Argentina's
info-highway. One certain competitor to VCC is Multicanal, a subsidiary of
Argentina's largest media/entertainment group, Clarin (TVI, Feb. 13, 1995).
Multicanal has an agreement with Spain's aggressive Telefonica
Internacional (TISA), a controlling shareholder in Telefonica de Argentina;
TISA plans to buy 25% of Multicanal.

Four players - Telecom, CableVision (owned by TCI Intl.), Fincable/Cabtel
and VCC - are expected to play major roles in the combined services market,
but mat well pair off. If Telecom teams up with one of the three MSOs, VCC,
by virtue of size, would seem the most likely candidate; talks are said to
be underway.

But Telecom, with a less-focused expansion strategy than Telefonica's, may
take a while to select its partner. Continental and VCC may decide they can
happily focus on finding a U.S. long-distance carrier to pair with.

VCC could also join forces with Fincable/Cabtel, two independent MSOs
administered as one by broadcaster Telefe (TVI, Jul. 31, 1995). There's
already a precedent: VCC considered buying into the Telefe MSOs a year ago,
but Continental balked at spending further dollars in a slowing economy.
Telefe's systems pepper B.A.'s satellite towns and could complement VCC's
presence.



Of more immediate concern to VCC than telephony is tight competition in
the overbuilt sections of greater Buenos Aires. VCC, Multicanal and
CableVision all overlap in the metropolis, along with several smaller
operators.

As a result, the MSOs are racing to upgrade plant, converting 550 MHz
headends to 750 MHz and installing fiber optic lines "to the node." The 750
MHz set-up allows VCC to increase from 50 to 78 video channels (without
digital compression), plus spare capacity for interactive services and
telephony. Internet connectivity should come on line this year.

Such enterprises require capital. Continental's buy-in was a private
transaction with Liberman, so none of the $150 million funded upgrade. But
with the help of Continental's relationship with U.S. banks, VCC secured a
$140 million syndicated loan from Citibank in November 1995.

VCC expects to secure a further $40 million loan in first quarter 1996,
from U.S. semi-governmental bank OPIC, together with the Export-Import
Bank. The loan will finance the purchase of U.S.-made hardware VCC requires
to continue its upgrade.

Though it's debatable whether continuing to add channels makes sense, the
big MSOs are under pressure to offer equal levels of program choices. As a
result, VCC and Multicanal have been playing catch up with CableVision
(TVI, Oct. 30, 1995), which has offered 65 channels since early 1994.
Pratola says that 100,000 VCC subscribers now get 70 channels - the rest 40
or 50 - and all B.A. subscribers should get the full range by second-half
1996.

During 1995 VCC began to distinguish its lineup by grouping channels by
genre. Hence Music 21, MTV Latino and MuchMusic are found on consecutive
channels.

Like its rivals, VCC has its own programming wing, Gala Producciones,
which generates 14 channels. Four of these are marketed outside the MSO,
earning an extra $22 million last year (nearly twice 1994); more channels
are planned. The company's most popular network is kids service Cablin,
ranked within the top 15 B.A. cable channels.



Like all Argentine MSOs, VCC must address the matter of tiering its
service - 70 channels in a single $33 package doesn't make financial sense.
Tiering, the gateway to pay TV, already exists in some provincial systems
where there is little or no competition. But VCC learned in 1992 not to act
alone in B.A.: when it tried to switch HBO Ole to premium status, requiring
an analog decoder, many subscribers switched to competing systems that
still offered the movie channel as a basic service. VCC abandoned the
experiment.

VCC, CableVision and Multicanal will have to agree to introduce tiering at
the same time. An accord may be struck this year due to two precipitating
factors.

First, soccer monopoly Torneos y Competencias (TyC) introduced a premium
Sunday soccer match for suburban B.A. and provincial subscribers last year.

TyC's premium service is available with the installation of an inexpensive
"trap" - a simple decoder on the outside of a house - rather than an analog
box, but many subscribers opt for the latter, which also decodes erotic
channels (scrambled by law). About 10% of VCC subscribers have these $180
analog decoders.

A second factor is the imminent arrival of DTH services which will offer
up a broad range of near video-on-demand and premium program options not
yet available on Argentine CATV. tv

Regulators seek to please all sides in Africa's new Rainbow Nation

It would be an enormous understatement to say that - like everything else
in the country - South Africa's broadcasting environment is changing. The
sector is being reworked from top to bottom, and market forces are vying
with political pressures for regulation in the national interest.

The forces driving change include the new African National Congress-led
government, business interests representing the white and black
communities, and foreign investors cautiously circling over what could be
the gateway to a resurgent Africa.

But there are several vexing issues to be resolved. At a very basic level,
ad agencies and census takers are scrambling to figure out just how many
newly-enfranchised citizens exist in the townships and cities, and whether
and when they will emerge as bona fide consumers. At the political level,
the monolithic South African Broadcasting Corporation represents a mammoth
regulatory chore; already a dispute is brewing between the SABC and the
Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) over what the new SABC should look
like.

The IBA's recommendations for the SABC go to the heart of the new South
Africa's putative broadcasting infrastructure. In late 1995, the IBA
recommended that SABC's channels be cut to two, licensing the network's
third channel as the country's first national, commercial, terrestrial
network.

The SABC's response was to re-launch all three channels, going directly
against the regulatory grain. The issue still has not been resolved.
Legislation along the lines of some of the IBA's recommendations is
expected in 1996, after a parliamentary committee considers its findings.

The SABC's only national rival is pay service M-Net, owned by a consortium
of South African publishers and banks, with 20% held by international pay
operator NetHold. Thanks to its NetHold affiliation, M-Net is now
spearheading DTH developments in South Africa and the entire continent. The
SABC also announced at end-1995 its plans for a satellite service.

At the beginning of January, the IBA said it would begin licensing
satellite services in the second half of 1996, amid uncertainty about
whether its powers actually extended to this activity. NetHold/MultiChoice
have already launched a digital satellite package on the understanding that
no licensing was required, beaming off PanAmSat 4.

The final sector to be affected by the wholesale changes will be South
Africa's still tiny independent TV production industry, now readying itself
for increased demand from both domestic and new, imported services.



Socio-economic changes

Alongside black economic empowerment, the biggest boost to television
viewing will come as a result of the giant housing and electrification
program. In the townships and shanty towns, the new black consumers are
buying - along with cookers and refrigerators - television sets.

In the still desperately-poor shanty town areas around Johannesburg, 42%
of dwellings have TV sets. Significantly, this is almost identical to the
percentage of dwellings with electricity. The scope for growth is enormous
- nationwide, over half of SA homes are still without electricity.

The number of TV homes is estimated at 4.4 million, and the national TV ad
spend is worth $50-$60 per home. Total ad spend is moving from print and
radio to TV, and from whites to blacks. In 1993, pay service M-Net received
around a quarter of all TV ad expenditure. The SABC's main service, TV1,
took 50%, while its more black-skewed service, CCV, took the remaining 25%.
But according to the SABC, in the year to March 1995, advertising revenues
for CCV grew 25.4%, while those for TV1 (whites) grew by only 14.7%.

The SABC's advertising revenues are around R900 million ($246.9 million)
per year. M-Net gets R300 million, putting total TV ad expenditure at
around $329.2 million. The SABC estimates that new commercial competitors
(in both radio and TV) will take R260-R380 million each year from its
annual revenues.

The SABC is also financed by a license fee, which is collected from 2.4
million TV homes, only 54% of estimated TV homes. This system is bound to
be changed. Innovative ideas, such as a tax on electricity consumption,
have been considered.

The SABC's three TV channels have enjoyed, M-Net aside, a monopoly on
free-to-air terrestrial broadcasting. TV1 has a largely white audience and
CCV (Common Cultural Values) a mainly black audience, while NNTV (National
Network TV) reaches fewer homes, catering to a mainly black viewership. The
two main channels carry nearly all the advertising, while NNTV brings in a
small amount of sponsorship revenues. TV1, CCV and NNTV reach 76%, 72% and
56% of the country respectively.

TV1 broadcasts overwhelmingly in English and Afrikaans, and despite 90%
geographical coverage of the population, only reaches 5.4 million adults.
The TV1 signal is also distributed by Intelsat 604 on a frequency covering
most of Africa, but requires a large, expensive dish. The programming mix
is broad-based, and TV1 operates as a mass-audience generalist service.

The CCV transmitter network covers only 20-25% of the country, but reaches
72.5% of the population. Around 80% of its prime time broadcasts are in
African languages and around 75% of its viewers are black.

NNTV, the newest of the three SABC channels, was launched in 1990 to try
to provide for as many of South Africa's 11 official languages as possible.
English takes up 44% of the airtime, with the remainder in Afrikaans (21%);
the Nguni languages, primarily Zulu and Xhosa (21%); and SeSotho (17%).
NNTV is only received in the major metropolitan areas. It also broadcasts
weekly programs in Portuguese and German for those respective communities.
NNTV carries no advertising, but does have sponsorship income.

In addition to the services operated by the SABC, four other
government-owned broadcasting services were established in the former
homelands. The largest is the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation with
a free-to-air service restricted to the area of the former Bophuthatswana
and the Witwatersrand. Unlike the SABC, the former homeland broadcasters
have been funded directly by the government.



The proposed environment

The IBA's proposals for a new broadcasting infrastructure to represent the
new country - and the developing market economy - cover a lot of ground:
the financial viability of the SABC, competition and the development of an
independent production industry. It has much less to say on satellite
broadcasting, though it is proposing future regulation in this area. Cable
does not feature in the IBA's report.

The key IBA recommendation is that the SABC reduce its channels from three
to two by the end of 1997, though it recognizes the corporation may need
another year to downsize and rationalize.

The IBA suggests that some of the programming on NNTV be absorbed into the
other two channels and that NNTV be repositioned as a satellite service.
The former homeland services will be merged with the SABC's two channels.

In January 1998, the IBA will issue a license for a new private
terrestrial network with heavy public service language and local content
obligations. But there is political and commercial pressure for this date
to be brought forward.

There are already a number of contenders for the new service, including
Southern Media, a consortium that includes the UK's Channel 4, black
development group KTI and others. Its rivals include: Free-to-Air, a group
headed by TV1 head Quentin Green; a joint venture including Moribo
Investments, part of the black empowerment group Thebe, and Interleisure;
and MTV South Africa, including Primedia Broadcasting and musician Johnny
Clegg. Others may join the lists.

The IBA favors a regional third TV network because of the centralized
nature of present broadcasting. It also proposes that the SABC have
regional windows in its schedule. The new SA has nine provinces, of which
Gauteng (around Johannesburg) and the Western Cape are the most
economically advanced and have the most extensive production facilities.

There will also be minimum requirements for specific program categories,
which may include minimum hourly requirements across the schedule and
within prime time. Both the SABC and the new private licensee will have
African language conditions imposed.

Foreign investment in SA television is currently limited to 20%, though
this is essentially theoretical, since M-Net has provided the only
investment vehicle to date. The IBA will maintain this limit and will
introduce cross-media ownership limits. No group or person with control of
a newspaper with more than 15% of circulation in the relevant area may have
financial control (a 15% stake) in a radio or TV license.

The IBA proposals are controversial, not least in the way that the SABC
may be carved up. The network's response has been to announce plans to
relaunch its three channels in 1996 as SABC 1, SABC 2 and SABC 3. It says
English-language broadcasts will constitute 65% of its airtime, with
Afrikaans only taking up 3.8%. SABC 1 will use the current CCV signal and
will broadcast in the Nguni languages in prime time. SABC 2 will replace
TV1 and will broadcast in Afrikaans and SeSotho during prime time. SABC 3
will take the NNTV slot, broadcasting in English during prime time.

The announcement has infuriated Afrikaners; the former ruling National
Party has even threatened to block the SABC's attempt to get a R500 million
grant ($136 million) from the government.

This raises the issue of public broadcasting funding. The IBA is proposing
that these services be funded through a mix of advertising and sponsorship,
license fees, government grants and other income such as merchandising.
This would be reviewed after three years. Parliament should also provide
funding on a triennial basis toward increasing African language and local
content programming on the SABC, says the IBA.

The SABC is now mainly funded through ad revenues. In the 1993/1994
financial year, 74% of its income was from advertising revenues, license
fees made up 20%, and other income contributed 6%. There was no direct
state funding or grant, and the corporation achieved a surplus of R106.2
million and generated a cash flow surplus of R77.8 million for the year.



But new programming regulations could cripple the SABC, and state
subventions for increased African language and local broadcasts are
considered essential. The SBAC has already said it cannot meet these local
content requirements (see column, p.5) and stay within budget. It wants the
IBA to reduce "performance periods" for measuring local content to a
maximum of 10-12 hours from 18 hours.

According to the SABC, providing 30 minutes of local news a day in each of
the nine provinces would cost an extra R153.1 million in 1996/1997, R168.4
million in 1997/1998 and R185.2 million in 1998/1999. Local content
regulations (including the upgrading African language provision) will cost
R70.8 million in 1996/1997, R155.8 million in 1997/1998 and R31 million in
1998/1999.

The cost of implementing another report, this time on educational
broadcasting, is estimated at R160.3 million in 1996/7. From January 1 the
SABC replaced Sky News with BBC Worldwide as its main foreign news
provider, and the deal may be extended to include an education package.
Worldwide last September created a new Worldwide Learning Division.

On the positive side of the balance sheet, the state will benefit from the
integration of former homeland broadcasters, saving approximately R120
million per annum. The SABC's Sentech signal generator, which controls its
network of transmitters, will be converted to a public company, with the
shares transferred from the SABC to the state.



Production

Though the SABC figures are vague, independent production currently
constitutes roughly 12.4% of its total broadcast time. The IBA's proposed
regulations in this area are ambitious to say the least: it wants
broadcasters to ensure that, in the future, 40% of their local content is
commissioned from independent production companies controlled by black
South Africans or women and are based in a range of different provinces and
non-metropolitan areas and represent new talent.

The IBA is also determined to break the old boys' club of white male
producers at the SABC. The Film and Television Federation, the Black
Producers Association and the SABC have now joined forces to jointly
develop new commissioning procedures and terms of trade.



Pay TV

Until 1995, there was only one pay TV player in South Africa. M-Net, has 1
million subscribers and is reckoned to be at saturation level, though it
did add around 100,000 subs in 1995. M-Net takes 27% of TV advertising
revenues and is now looking for opportunities elsewhere in Africa.

In October 1993, M-Net sold its subscriber management services and
technology (ComTech) divisions, as well as its investments outside South
Africa, to a new company, MultiChoice, which manages a package of satellite
channels that includes M-Net, as well as handling M-Net's terrestrial
subscriber management.

M-Net had an "open time" arrangement with the SABC for an unencrypted
period in the early evening, but the initial agreement has expired and is
now under negotiation. By a reciprocal arrangement, also likely to be
renegotiated, the SABC's TV1 has been available to MultiChoice viewers in
Africa, while MultiChoice also rebroadcasts TV1 to Namibia.

With M-Net's terrestrial service now mature and the SABC under pressure to
relinquish terrestrial frequencies, the satellite sector offers the most
action. MultiChoice dominates the market, by virtue of having been the only
player for so long, but the SABC has already leaped in to challenge
MultiChoice's dominant position.

M-Net currently beams its programs off Intelsat VI, as well as
broadcasting terrestrially. Intelsat 704, launched in February 1995, has a
Ku-Band spot beam that includes South Africa, as does the recently launched
PanAmSat 4. The SABC and MultiChoice have both leased transponder capacity
on PAS-4.

From July, the SABC started analog transmissions of its terrestrial
services on Ku-band. In October 1995, the SABC's board endorsed plans to
implement SABC-owned DTH television and radio services. The plan
anticipates the introduction of eight digital pay channels to launch by
July 1996 and 14-16 channels by the end of the year.

The SABC says this distribution mechanism will make the "best
international programming available in South Africa." It is already looking
for international players in a package that will include locally-produced
and multilingual programming as well as more recognizable services.

SABC has also talked of launching one free-to-air analog signal aimed at
rural areas and based on education and development-type programming,
another free analog channel carrying local and international product, and
eventually the digital services, mostly sourced from overseas.

In a carbon copy of the situation in Europe, the SABC is complaining to
the IBA that the incumbent DTH operator, MultiChoice, has a dominant
position because of its control of decoder technology. The SABC would like
the IBA to regulate against what it believes is a restraint on competition.
Local analysts doubt this will happen and see MultiChoice retaining its top
spot.

M-Net/MultiChoice is currently offering South Africans 16 digital TV
channels, three radio channels and 40 music channels commercially via
PAS-4, having launched the service on November 1, 1995. The channels
include Supersport, Movie Magic and children's channel K-TV. Soon there
will also be Hallmark, SelecTV, TNT, ESPN Africa, VH-1, TV5 Afrique, and
religious channel Trinity.

Another group, African Satellite Entertainment Corporation (ASEC), is
currently tranmitting two channels off Intelsat 704, beaming into South
Africa from neighboring Swaziland, and claims to have 35,00 subscribers.
But in December, the Swazi communications ministry threatened to withdraw
its license because of non-payment of fees to Swaziland Post and
Telecommunications Corporation.

Estimates of the potential DTH market vary. Estimated dish sales in 1996
vary between 180,000 and 250,000, with around one-fifth digital. The
equipment supplier Aerial Empire estimates the figure in year one of
satellite DTH will be 100,000 systems sold. The saturation point could be
as low as 300,000 digital subscribers.

Digital dish installation is R4,500 and Multichoice costs R175 a month.
Analog costs R1,500 and a four channel subscription will cost R80 from
ASEC. tv
