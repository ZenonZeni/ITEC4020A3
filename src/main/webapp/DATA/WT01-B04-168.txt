<H1>Criticism of the Experiments on
Medical Prescription of Narcotics in Switzerland

</CENTER>
First I want to thank the organizers for the invitation and the opportunity
to give you a short presentation of the heroin distribution projects carried
out in Switzerland.
<P>
For about eight years now, we have witnessed a gradual shift from a
restrictive to a more and more liberal drug policy in Switzerland. This
eventually led to the big open drug scene at the Platzspitz and later at the
Lettensteg in Zurich. Because of the reduced law enforcement, drugs became
more and more available. At that time, the distribution of heroin as a
measure of help for drug addicts was put on the political agenda.
<P>
In my presentation, I'll shortly explain the attitude of the Swiss Government
on drug policy. Then, after a presentation of the heroin projects, I will
focus on the scientific insufficiencies of these experiments.
<P>
<H3>The Swiss Federal Government</H3>
In February 1991 the Swiss Federal Government demanded measures to stabilize the number of drug addicts by 1993 and to reduce it by 20% until 1996. It demanded further efforts in the field of prevention and therapy as well as assistance and support for addicts. At that time, a scientifically
accompanied pilot project on the distribution of narcotics to addicts was
taken into consideration; the distribution of heroin, however, should be
excluded in any case. This was in 1991: definitely no heroin distribution.
<P>
Nevertheless, the Federal Government - under strong political pressure -
agreed upon a scientifically accompanied project on the medical prescription
of narcotics including heroin in May 1992. In October 1993, the responsible
authority, the Federal Office of Public Health, approved on 7 submitted
projects in bigger cities of Switzerland.
<P>
<H3>Aims of the experiments</H3>
In the experimental design the general objective of the experiments is
described as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Projects on the medical prescription of narcotics to drug addicts are
defined as scientific experiments aimed at examining the success of this kind
of  therapy as one step towards drug abstinence."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus, the success of the projects should be determined by the number of
participants who become drug abstinent.
<P>
Further aims are:
<UL>
<LI>Improvement of the physical and/or mental health of the addicts
<LI>Improvement of their social integration (e.g. reduction of delinquency)
<LI>Improvement of their responsible behaviour concerning the risk of
HIV-infection
</UL>
<H3>Research questions of the experimental plan</H3>
The experimental plan includes a number of questions, for instance about
general well-being, ability to work, contacts with the drug scene, delinquent
behaviour, risk behaviour, subjective effects of drugs, preference of drugs
and ways of application, to mention only some of them. The data come from
questionnaires and interviews with the participants.
<P>
<H3>Types of projects</H3>
The participants get either iv heroin, iv morphine or iv methadone. They also
get other substances like oral methadone, benzodiazepines or
anti-depressants. The experiment is conducted in five different types of
projects. They deal with different target groups or contextual conditions. In
three of the project types the decision which drug is given to which addict
is made by the doctor who asks the addict for his preferences. Two projects
started with a randomized allocation one of them is also double blind. This
double blind project, however, was soon abandoned. The addicts may now choose the substance themselves.
<P>
<H3>Number of participants and changes of the project design</H3>
Originally, the experimental groups (heroin, methadone, morphine) were
supposed to be of the same size, 250 subjects each. For heroin being the drug
of choice of most of the addicts, the heroin groups were filled much faster
than the other two groups. So in December 1994, there was a first extension
of the heroin group up to 500 subjects. In May 1995 a second extension was
decided upon. The number of heroin places was then increased up to 800.
Additionally, the project design was changed in that the heroin distribution
projects were to be integrated into existing methadone maintenance programs
and the prescription of narcotics should be extended to patients with
psychiatric disorders and to prisoners. The next steps which are discussed
are the possibilities to take drugs home, to make cocaine available and to
further extent the inclusion criteria (NZZ 16.8.95). This means they want to
make it easier for the addicts to participate in the projects.
<P>
<H3>Actual size of the groups</H3>
By April 1st, 1995, there were 286 participants in the heroin group, 28 in
the morphine group and 41 in the methadone group. Of the possible number of
988 places, only 355 are filled.
<P>
<H3>Criticism</H3>
From a scientific point of view, those narcotics distribution projects in
Switzerland and their scientific evaluation have to be criticized for a lot
of reasons. 
<P>
First of all, I think that the distribution of heroin to drug addicts has to
be rejected for ethical reasons. Human beings should not be misused as
experimental rabbits! Negative effects on the whole society, an increase of
the drug problem, an increase of delinquency and of the HIV epidemic have to
be expected.  The devastating effects of such projects were already
demonstrated in different countries at different times. 
<P>
Let us continue with the research questions. They are partly formulated in a
very general and unspecific way. The answers to this questions will be based
on questionnaires and interviews done with addicts who know that their future depends on their answers, and taken by professionals whose professional future depends on the outcome of these projects. A lot of energy is wasted and questions such as drug tolerance, side effects and withdrawal symptoms could have been answered easily by referring to the existing scientific literature.
<P>
Unfortunately, the most controversial questions are not examined: The effect
of the projects on the drug scene, the effect on drug related delinquency and
the effect on the AIDS epidemic. 
<P>
A fact which will result in a very difficult scientific problem is that the
project design was changed several times in different ways. The number of
subjects was changed, the number of experimental groups was changed, the type of drug allocation was changed.
<P>
A major criticism has to focus on the different group size of the heroin and
the other groups. You get into serious statistical trouble if you try to get
significant results from a comparison of two groups if the number of subjects in one group is ten times higher than the number in the other group. Being aware of this forthcoming problem, the director of the experiment decided just not to compare the three groups. For my understanding, this is one further step away from a scientific approach. 
<P>
Another basic deficiency of the project design is that there is no drug free
control group.
<P>
And above all, the polydrug use is a major pitfall of the evaluation of the
heroin projects. According to Prof. Uchtenhagen, the director of the
experiment, only 10% of the participants are pure heroin consumers, whereas
about 80% additionally consume cocaine and/or other drugs. The participants
are not required to take only the drugs they get in the projects and there is
no systematic testing on drugs.
<P>
Obviously, the politicians who favoured this type of project and evaluation
do not really believe in what is said in the general objective of the
experiment itself, namely that this kind of therapy should be one step
towards drug abstinence. 
<P>
I think it is generally questionable if such a controversial issue like
giving heroin to heroin addicts is to be evaluated by means of a project
which is not designed according to scientific standards. The term scientific
just refers to the "accompanying scientific evaluation". Ladies and
Gentlemen, such a kind of scientific evaluation cannot compensate for the
weaknesses of the project design and for the soft and biased data.
