<H4><a name="4.19">Stimulating Markets for Renewable Resources </H4></a>
The Administration is working throughout the Federal Government to identify and overcome
market barriers and accelerate market acceptance of cost-effective renewable energy technologies.
Integrated Resource Planning programs assist States in evaluating the contribution that renewables
can make to energy supply and environmental protection. Other Federal programs focus the
purchasing power of Federal agencies and help aggregate markets to provide market pull for
advanced technologies such as alternatively fueled vehicles, photovoltaic systems, and geothermal
heat pumps.<BR>
<P>
One important example is the Solar Enterprise Zone (SEZ) that has been proposed for the
Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site. Formerly used for weapons tests, this facility has an
excellent solar resource and efforts are under way to convert it to a solar power generation and
equipment manufacturing site. The Enron and Amoco corporations have proposed a joint 100-
megawatt photovoltaic manufacturing and generation project for the site.<BR>
<P>
The collaborative Biomass Power for Rural Development Initiative between the Department of
Energy and the Department of Agriculture is designed to demonstrate the economic and
environmental viability and sustainability of integrated feedstock production and power conversion
technologies through partnerships with farm communities to produce reliable supplies of biomass
feedstocks and cost-competitive electric power. A request for proposals has already garnered more
than 350 applications.<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy's Wind Energy Program provides incentives to utilities, manufacturers,
and third-party funders to develop multimegawatt wind energy farms using state-of-the-art
machines. In fiscal year 1996, the program will stimulate up to 150 megawatts of new installed
capacity, make six new advanced wind turbines available, and participate in up to 20 new cost-
shared partnerships.<BR>
<P>
The Department of Energy also is helping U.S. renewable energy equipment and services firms
compete internationally by conducting trade missions and sustainable development demonstrations
in large, newly emerging privatized markets to stimulate market pull for these technologies.
Markets for photovoltaic, wind, and geothermal electric systems are emerging as especially
important. Special emphasis is placed on markets in Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, Africa,
and Eastern Europe.<BR>
<P>
Through partnerships with industry and international financial institutions such as the World Bank,
the Department of Energy has been able to leverage small commercialization investments in
renewable energy technologies to expanding overseas markets. The Department's Solar
International Program uses a variety of strategies to secure a greater U.S. market share by
addressing trade and other market barriers that continue to impede the acceptance of renewable
technologies abroad.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.20">Coal: Reducing Environmental Impacts</H4></a>
The Administration's policy is to help industry develop cleaner and more efficient uses for coal as
part of the U.S. energy portfolio. Because the primary risks of coal use are environmental rather
than economic or security-related, technology development and deployment that reduce
environmental impacts are critical to sustaining coal's contribution to U.S. energy needs.<BR>
<P>
The United States relies on coal for  22 percent of its total energy consumption. Fifty-five percent
of U.S. electricity is generated from coal, and EIA projects that coal will hold this market share
through at least 2010. Domestic coal resources are sufficiently large to sustain economic
production at high levels for several hundred years. In fact, the United States has more proved
reserves of coal on an energy-equivalent basis than the rest of the world has oil. In terms of market
price for delivered energy, coal is also our least expensive energy source, providing economical
energy for electric power and industrial needs.<BR>
<P>
Internationally, coal will continue to be a major source of fuel for electric power generation. Many
developing countries, such as China and India, will continue to use inexpensive, abundant,
indigenous coal to meet growing domestic needs. This trend could greatly increase the use of coal
worldwide as economies in these countries continue to expand.<BR>
<P>
In recent years, the major, long-term environmental concern about coal use has changed from acid
rain to greenhouse gas emissions primarily carbon dioxide from combustion and, to a lesser
extent, methane from mining operations. Coal accounts for more than one-third of U.S. human-
made carbon dioxide emissions, or about 4 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.21">Supporting Clean Coal Technology Development</H4></a>
Technological improvements over the past two decades have reduced significantly the
environmental impacts of coal combustion, and that trend is expected to continue for many of the
conventional regulated air pollutants. Today's technology can capture more than 95 percent of
sulfur dioxide emissions and 99.5 percent of particulates released from coal combustion. Nitrogen
oxide emissions, which are an important contributor to ozone (smog) formation, can be reduced
substantially by new burner technology and other emission controls. Many newer coal
technologies produce a benign solid waste or, in some cases, commercially marketable
byproducts. While no economic technologies currently exist to remove carbon dioxide from stack
gases, high-efficiency technology can cost-effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of
energy supplied.<BR>
<P>
Thus, while major environmental improvements have been made in our ability to use coal, the
biggest impediment to using coal in a sustainable energy future, particularly in developing
countries, is the cost of pollution control. Success in developing cleaner, more efficient and cost-
effective technology, coupled with persuading countries to implement environmental regulatory
systems that are responsive to economic and health constraints, will determine coal's ultimate role.<BR>
<P>
The long-term risk of investing in new technologies that have not been demonstrated in multiple
commercial applications inhibits the new technology market to such an extent that Federal
resources have been needed to help fund commercial demonstration efforts. The Department of
Energy's cost-shared Clean Coal Technology Demonstration Program, to which industry has
contributed $2 for every $1 of Federal money invested, has evolved from an early focus on
emission control systems to an emphasis in its later rounds on highly efficient, environmentally
superior advanced power systems. With thermal efficiencies that will approach 50 percent as these
technologies mature, compared with 35 percent for current state-of-the-art technologies, these clean
coal technologies can have a measurable effect on reducing carbon emissions. Emissions of acid
rain precursors from these advanced technologies are also well below those required for new
sources under the Clean Air Act and are especially valuable under the sulfur dioxide emission caps
established under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. <BR>
<P>
The emission-control technologies of the early rounds of Clean Coal Technology are now being
commercialized, and the advanced power systems of the later rounds also will reach commercial
status within a decade. Recent studies by the National Academy of Sciences and the National Coal
Council conclude that continued Federal support is needed to ensure that these advanced
technologies will be available. In the future, the Department of Energy will focus its coal R&D
program on advanced electric power technologies with efficiencies of 60 percent and 10 to 20
percent lower generating costs, making a new generation of power systems available through
government-industry cost-shared investments. <BR>
<P>
By 2010, commercial deployment of advanced coal power systems supported by the
Administration is projected to account for 56 gigawatts of capacity per year in both domestic and
export markets.<BR>
<P>
The Administration supports the efforts of U.S. vendors of clean coal technologies to export
equipment and services, because one key to commercial success would be expanding foreign
markets for these U.S. equipment makers. The use of clean and efficient U.S. generation
equipment, including clean coal technology, will help reduce the global environmental impacts
from expanded coal-fired generation and create U.S. jobs to develop and build these advanced
power systems.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.22">Improving Environmental Outcomes From Mining Operations	</H4></a>
If not done properly, the mining of coal can also have severe impacts on the environment. The
1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established the Federal Office of Surface
Mining and Enforcement (OSM) within the Department of the Interior to develop and implement
deferral reclamation standards for all coal surface mines in the United States. The Act also
provided States with the authority and funding to implement State programs that meet the minimal
Federal requirements.<BR>
<P>
Although controversy has plagued the implementation of the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act since its inception, much progress has been made during the last 15 years in
cleaning up abandoned mines and in implementing standards for the environmentally safe mining
of  coal. To improve the relationship between State and Federal regulators, OSM has developed its
Shared Commitment policy with States and tribes to move its regulatory program to a higher level
of success. The goal is to ensure that OSM, the States, and tribes will work together in an
environmentally safe manner and that land and water will be restored after mining ceases.<BR>
<P>
OSM has also initiated its Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative. The initiative is a cooperative
effort between several Federal, State, and private agencies to restore streams in the Appalachian
region that have been plagued for decades by severe acid mine drainage from both abandoned and
current coal mining operations.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.23">Nuclear Energy: Increasing Safety and Preserving Options</H4></a>
The Administration's policy is to maintain the safe operation of existing nuclear plants in the
United States and abroad and to preserve the option to construct the next generation of nuclear
energy plants. The policy is implemented by working with industry to enhance safety and by
continuing to press for safe storage of spent nuclear fuel.<BR>
<P>
Nuclear energy supplies more than 20 percent of the Nation's electricity supply. Measured levels of safety at U.S. nuclear plants continue to improve, and production costs continue to decrease, as
plants increase their efficiency and production capability. Many of these plants are expected to seek
renewed licenses from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for an additional 20 years of
operation. However, some of them will close at, or even before, the end of their current license
terms.<BR>
<P>
The continued use of nuclear energy as a part of our energy resource portfolio depends on ensuring
the safe operation of the Nation's nuclear plants and providing an acceptable means of spent fuel
disposal. In addition, industry must acquire sufficient experiential data on long-term materials
degradation during plant lifetimes, as well as experience in implementing NRC requirements for
relicensing U.S. nuclear energy plants, to avoid premature shutdowns, fewer license renewals, and possible delays in orders for advanced nuclear energy plants.<BR>
<P>
Globally, a significant threat to nuclear safety is the continued operation of older Soviet-designed
reactors in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Many Soviet-designed plants
lack the high standards of safety demonstrated by the design, construction, and operation of
Western nuclear energy plants. <BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.24">Working With Industry To Maintain Safety Levels and Preserve Future Options</H4></a>
The Administration's policy is to increase operational safety at existing nuclear plants. The
Department of Energy will continue to assist utilities in extending the safe, efficient, economical,
and reliable operational lifetimes of existing nuclear energy plants in the United States. All such
activities will be cost-shared with industry on at least a 50-50 basis. The Department also will
assist industry in preserving the nuclear option for future generations by participating in the
development of improved, standardized, and certified advanced light-water reactor designs that
offer improved active and passive safety systems, simplified construction and operation, and
greater economy.<BR>
<P>
In May 1995, the NRC issued a new procedure for applying to extend the license of a nuclear
energy plant, now set at 40 years. The NRC's rule streamlines and simplifies the operating license
renewal process by eliminating unnecessary requirements, reducing the number of plant systems
and components subject to review, and focusing attention on significant safety issues. <BR>
<P>
The Administration has made achieving the greatest possible degree of global nuclear safety a top
priority. The Department of Energy will lead U.S. participation in international efforts to enhance
nuclear safety in Russia, Ukraine, and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to improve the
safety of Soviet-designed reactors. Current efforts are focused on improving operational safety,
reducing near-term risks, enhancing regulatory regimes, and establishing an effective nuclear
safety culture in the workplace. The Department of Energy will also encourage two-way
technology transfer by facilitating commercial ventures between U.S. companies and countries
with Soviet-designed reactors to upgrade the knowledge and operational experience of nuclear
plant operators in the United States and abroad.<BR>
<P>
The Administration also promotes improving the safety of nuclear energy abroad by actively
supporting the U.S. nuclear industry's pursuit of the multibillion dollar international nuclear energy export market. Because of the demonstrated quality of U.S. nuclear technologies and expertise, substantial opportunities to export U.S. nuclear energy equipment and services exist in many parts of the world, particularly the Pacific Rim, Central and Eastern Europe, and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. These technologies and services would include orders for upgrades of nuclear safety systems and other plant components, emergency-related equipment, personnel training programs, environmental cleanup at nuclear facilities, and nuclear waste management.<BR>
<P>
By 1999, the Department of Energy's cost-shared nuclear energy program will produce four NRC-
certified advanced light-water reactor designs with passive safety systems and simplified
construction and operation available for the marketplace.<BR>
<P>
<H4><a name="4.25">Resolving the Problem of Spent Fuel Disposal</H4></a>
The accumulation of high-level radioactive wastes from commercial nuclear power installations in
the United States could severely limit the contribution of nuclear energy to the Nation's energy
portfolio. The Administration's policy is to expedite the characterization of a geological repository
as a safe method for high-level waste disposal, and if determined to be safe, to build a geological
repository to accept commercial nuclear waste. <BR>
<P>
Ten countries that use nuclear energy to provide a substantial fraction of their energy needs have
selected deep geological repositories for final spent fuel disposal. A consensus appears to have
emerged in the international community that this is the method of choice. By the end of 1998, the
Department of Energy's Civilian Radioactive Waste Management program will have assessed the
technical suitability of the Yucca Mountain candidate site as a geologic repository and, if the site is
suitable, will license and operate a repository by 2010. Currently, utilities are relying on existing or
incremental spent-fuel storage capacity. To provide a standard technology for the safe storage,
transportation, and disposal of commercial spent nuclear fuel and to minimize fuel handling, the
Department of Energy is developing multipurpose canisters for potential use by utilities on their
sites and, subsequently, at storage and disposal facilities.<BR>
<P>
Steady and sustained progress on the U.S. repository effort will reinforce the worldwide
fundamental agreement on geologic disposal and help strengthen other nations' resolve to pursue
geologic disposal as the preferred long-term radioactive waste management solution. Our Nation's
commitment to geologic disposal is essential to maintaining confidence in the integrity of our
domestic once-through fuel cycle, which supports the Administration's opposition to international
reprocessing alternatives. In addition to providing geologic disposal for spent fuel from civilian
reactors, the repository will be designed to accept other high-level radioactive wastes, consistent
with the Administration's nonproliferation goals and its opposition to the reprocessing of spent
nuclear fuel.</BODY><BR><HR><P>
