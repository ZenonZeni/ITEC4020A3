<h1><center> Inflammatics: Building on serendipity</h1> </center> <p>

The idea for a cell-based immunotherapeutic vaccine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis came to J. Bruce Smith, a rheumatologist and professor of medicine at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, from witnessing an improvement of symptoms in many of his RA patients during pregnancy.<P>
Smith discovered that the women who improved during pregnancy were carrying fetuses with HLA (human leukocyte antigen) types dissimilar to themselves but similar to that of the father -- which meant the fetuses could be seen as "allografts" or foreign grafts. <P>
<b><center>Protein shields</b></center><P>
He understood that a pregnant woman's immune system produces proteins that shield the developing fetus from rejection as a foreign body, and that this protective mechanism -- known as the TH2 response -- involves suppressing the inflammatory response, including the cytokines IL-10 and IL-4. <P>
Smith hypothesized that a similar response could be induced in RA patients who were not pregnant by introducing foreign white blood cells. In addition, Smith and a colleague had other experience preventing repeated spontaneous abortion in non-RA women using a similar approach -- giving white blood cells from the father to stimulate a TH2 response. <P>
<b><center>Basis for company</b></center><P>
Smith and Nigel Smart, formerly of Allelix Pharmaceuticals, also believed that a mononuclear cell-based approach could be effective in other autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). They founded Inflammatics in July 1995 as a virtual company to develop vaccines for RA and other autoimmune conditions, based on their mononuclear cell vaccine. <P>
Results of an open-label RA vaccine trial in 11 female patients immunized with allogeneic white blood cells were published recently in the Journal of Rheumatology. In that study, seven patients showed significant improvement in at least two of five measures of active RA. <A HREF ="/BioCentury2/archive/1996/1qtr/021296a1.htm">(see BioCentury, Feb. 12)</A>. Side-effects were temporary local pain and swelling at the site of subcutaneous injection. <P>
The company plans to begin a controlled, blinded, cross-over trial by mid-April in 120 men and women. Patients will receive injections every five weeks from the same donor -- either a spouse or a friend. Smith said that even if the vaccine only works with women, it still would be a substantial contribution, as 70 percent of RA patients are women. <P>
A cell-based immunotherapeutic would be significantly less expensive than the cost of traditional DMARDs (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs), such as methotrexate, injectable and oral gold, and anti-malarials, according to the company. Treatment of a patient with advanced RA can run $14,000-$22,000 per year with DMARDs, which includes testing for toxicity. In contrast, the cost of the cell-based therapy includes $80-$90 for a unit of blood, and less than $50 for the cost of preparing the cells (separating the white blood cells), according to Smith. <P>
<b><center>Other approaches</b></center><P>
Other DMARDs/immunological approaches on the market or in development include Sandoz's Sandimmune, SmithKline Beecham's chimeric anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody licensed from IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp., Immunex Corp.'s interleukin-1 receptor and TNF receptor, and Immune Response Corp.'s therapeutic vaccines based on T cell receptor inhibitors, according to Smart. <P>
The company was started in December 1995 with a $100,000 loan from the Ben Franklin Foundation. The loan is renewable for three years. Inflammatics is in the process of raising $3 million in venture capital, which Smart expects will cover the first clinical trial, plus development activities for the next two years. <P>
Inflammatics plans to remain virtual for its first 18 months. Smart expects that Inflammatics will, at two years, then look to a private placement or perhaps an IPO for $12-$20 million, assuming positive results from the upcoming Phase I/II trial. <P>
The company also will seek partners for its programs. Inflammatics expects to manufacture its own vaccine, and will pay for it via equity financing or a partnership with a blood processing company. <P>
Ultimately, Inflammatics expects to develop a synthetic peptide-based pharmaceutical to treat RA and other diseases. In the medium term, it may also purify and resynthesize synthetic analogs of alloantigens to develop a second-generation, more active compound that it is now using. <P>
The company plans to focus next on MS, using the same types of cells. It also plans to target psoriatric arthritis, which accounts for about 10 percent of psoriasis patients. Other future therapeutic targets will include graft rejection and sarcoidosis. <P>
The company is in the early stage of developing a specific treatment diagnostic for RA, which will be based either on tissue typing or cytokine production, and will be used to determine who would be most likely to benefit from the immunotherapy, and which types of cells to use in the treatment. <P>
