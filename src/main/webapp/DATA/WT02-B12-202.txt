<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">The US Justice Department

sued Waukegan, Illinois over a housing ordinance the government

alleges was enacted and enforced to limit the number of Hispanic

families who could live there. Waukegan, 35 miles north of Chicago,

was charged with violating the Fair Housing Act by enacting an

ordinance on June 6, 1994 that permits only a husband and wife,

their children and no more than two additional relatives to live

in one home, regardless of its size.</FONT></TT>

<P>

<TT><FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE="Courier">According to the Justice

Department, all those evicted under the ordinance have been Hispanic.

The city of 69,000 had a population that was 24 percent Hispanic

in the 1990 Census. The ordinance, according to the Justice Department,

would permit overcrowding by people who are not related, but prohibit

relatives from living together.</FONT></TT>

by the 2,500 residents who inhabit Sibley Manor housing development

in St. Paul, Minnesota. Eighty percent of the residents are new

Americans. The housing complex is home to Russians, Hispanics

and southeast Asians. </FONT></TT>
