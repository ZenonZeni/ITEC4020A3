interests in sustainbale mountain development, drawn from the
academic and development cooperation communities. The group was
created before the Rio Earth Summit to raise the position of the
mountains on the global environment agenda.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=6>1 Why Focus on Mountains?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Mountains are an important source of water, energy and biological
diversity.  Furthermore, they are a source of such key resources
as minerals, forest, agricultural products and recreation.  As
a major ecosystem representing the complex and interrelated ecology
of our planet, mountain environments are essential to the survival
of the global ecosystem.&quot;  Agenda 21, Chapter 13.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>What are mountains?<BR>
</B>
<P>
There is no clear definition of mountains and highlands and perhaps
this will always be so, because mountains with different altitudes
and specific patterns of ecosystems are found on every continent,
from the equator to the polar regions.  Given their three-dimenesional
nature, they encompass the most extensive array of topography,
climate, flora and fauna, as well as human cultural differentiation,
known on earth.  In lieu of an overly simplistic definition with
altitude above sea level, mountains can be characterised by their
altitudinal succession of different climatic, geomorphic, and
vegetational belts.  Regardless of absolute altitudes, mountains
include all areas of a marked relief with significan ecological
differences and slopes which are susceptible to natural hazards
and human activities.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>46.7%  of the total area of the continents is above
500m;  26.9% above 1000m; and 11.1% over 2000m.  These simple
figures show that Mountains and Highlands are indeed a major ecosystem
of our planet!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Mountains in the historical perspective <BR>
</B>
<P>
Mountains and highlands have always played an important role in
the history of humankind.  In the beginning, they were experienced
as both frightening and divine, and were often used as a refuge
by persecuted groups and tribes (e.g. Kirdi in Cameroon).  Lowland
people mostly perceived mountain inhabitants as barbarian and
unlawful.  Later on, mountain valleys and passes became important
for  traffic and transport.  Improved economic conditions, together
with increasing strategic significance, served as the nucleus
for the formation of mountain states (e.g. Switzerland).  Scientific
interests (e.g. Saussure, Rousseau) and subsequent enthusiasm
for mountains has grown in the last few centuries, followed by
the conquest of the high summits (e.g. Everest 1952).  Since then,
mountain, human, and natural resources have been recognized and
have become the focus of new attention from humankind.<BR>
<P>
<B>Mountain Resources for the 21<FONT SIZE=1>st</FONT> Century
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Agenda 21, chapter 13 was a great step forward towards realising
the resource potential of the mountain world.  One of the major
problems in the next century will be water shortage;  more than
half the world's fresh water comes from the mountains and highlands.
 Biodiversity is being threatened throughout the world:  The mountains,
especially in the tropics, are treasures of diversity for future
generations.  Since Rio, knowledge and information have been improved,
not only about water and biodiversity, but also about energy,
timber, minerals, agriculture, tourism, etc.  Preserving the diversity
of mountain ecosystems also means understanding cultural diversity,
including the religious, easthetic, ethic, and recreational significance
of mountains for humankind.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Significance of the mountain chapter in Agenda 21<BR>
</B>
<P>
Chapter 13 has two programme areas:  <BR>
<P>
<B>Generating and strengthening
knowledge about the ecology and sustainable development of mountain
ecosystems,</B> 
<P>
<B>Promoting integrated watershed
development and alternative livelihood opportunities.</B><BR>
<P>
In the first debates the question for the necessity of a special
mountain chapter arose.  It was argued that all the elements of
maountin areas are included in other chapters or conventions of
Agenda 21, i.e. Combating Deforestation, Sustainable Agriculture
and Rural Development, Conservation of Biological Diversity, Protecting
and Managing Fresh Water, Combating Poversy, Strengtheninmg the
Role of Indigenous People, Partnerships with NGO's, Science for
Sustainable development, etc.  It is true that mountain problems
have a connection to all these chapters, but it would be a great
error to split the fragile ecosystems of our world, like the tropical
rainforests, the arid zones, the coastal zones, etc. into many
independent sectors.  Preservation of fragile ecosystems, especially
the mountain ecosystems with their precious resources for our
future, requires research and integrated development programmes
with a stronger emphasis on linkages between economic, cultural,
and ecologic aspects.  Sustainable mountain development has to
be approached in a more comprehensive way.  <BR>
<P>
<B>Awareness of mountains since Rio, Agenda 21<BR>
</B>
<P>
A large number of organizations, NGOs, governmental institutions,
research centres, and private individuals have suddenly shown
more interest in sustainable mountain development.  Since Rio
and itsAgenda 21, mountains have been less marginalised.  A growing
urbanised world population is beginning to recognize the value
of human and natural resources of mountain areas.  Governments
are beginning to realise that long-term mountain policies are
needed.  Mountains and highlands become a focus of humanity into
the 21<FONT SIZE=1>st</FONT> century.<BR>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Dynamic environments: living with uncertainty<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Mountains are high&#173;energy environments. This brings many
challenges to planning their diverse uses, especially in relation
to minimizing the natural hazards that result from high rain&#173;
and snowfall, variations in temperature, steep slopes, seismic
activity and tectonic movement. The risks associated with mountain
environments are growing rapidly with increases in resident and
visiting populations, intensification and diversification of land
uses, and the construction of infrastructure. Risk assessment
and management are of ever greater importance.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Right: The eruption of volcanoes is one of the greatest
hazards for the populations of mountain areas and the world. When
Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, erupted in 1991, 6-8 billion m3 of
hot volcanic debris were ejected, destroying 350 km2 of land.
The eruption affected more than 400,000 people directly, and 1.5
million indirectly; it influenced the global climate for three
years. The 1993 eruption of Lascar, Chile, is shown here. Fallout
led to the closure of schools 200 km away. (Photo: Mina El Laco)

<P>
<B>Moving mountains<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mountains include some of the most dynamic landscapes on Earth.
The collision of continental plates &#173; the origin of mountain
building &#173; results in earth quakes and volcanic eruptions.
Mountains intercept moisture from the atmosphere, resulting in
both large amounts and high intensities of precipitation, causing
snow and ice avalanches and floods. A central concern is to minimize
such events, and to keep the water in the mountains to be used
productively before flowing downhill. The long, steep slopes of
mountains are characterized by the downwards movement not only
of water and snow, but also rocks and soil. While some processes
are rapid &#173; lava and pyroclastic flows, rockslides, rockfalls,
debris flows &#173; gradual processes, such as soil erosion, can
equally put the lives of mountain people at risk. Soil erosion
derives not only from the steepness of slopes, but also from human
mismanagement or other dynamic aspects of the mountain environment
such as heavy rainfall, strong wind, and changes in temperature.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Each year, Cherrapunji, Megalaya Hills of Bangladesh,
receives an average of 11.1 metros of</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>rainfall. In 1974, the total rainfall was 23.7 etres,
more than anywhere else on Earth. 8.2 metres of this fell in July.
</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>The origin of this rainfall is the convective clouds
formed as air rises over the mountains. (Photo T. Hofer)<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Avoiding catastrophes<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Mountain people who have long experience of a mountain area understand
the locations and likelihoods of natural hazards and catastrophes
of moderate magnitude and frequency. Mountain people avoid dangerous
areas, or take measures to control hazards. However, such knowledge
is not always used or recognized, particularly if the hazard is
a process as slow as soil erosion. Catastrophic events such as
glacial lake outbursts and debris avalanches related to volcanic
eruptions may have long return periods or may be triggered by
multiple causes. Consequently, they are very difficult to predict,
and are hardly recognized in people's perceptions. Rapid and desastrous
events are often confined to valleys, where human settlements,
transport and other infrastructure are concentrated. The potential
for losses of lives and property may be very high.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>left: There is a delicate balance in using steep
mountain slopes. Valuable agricuHural land can be lost when cultivation
is practiced on too steep slopes, as here in the Kakani valley,
Nepal, where an exceptional monsoon rain triggered this landslide.

<FONT SIZE=2>The importance of protecting Andermatt, Switzerland,
from avalanches was already recognized by a local law in 1397.

avalanche protection structures. (Photo: Swiss Airforce)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The risk of landslides Is a growing problem for urban
areas, such as the densely&#173;populated Jizukiyama area of Nagano
Prefecture, Japan. Heavy rain caused this landslide, which killed
26 people. Rehabilitation and stabilization cost S100 million.

<FONT SIZE=5>Mountain ecosystems: fragile and diverse<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Mountain plant and animal communities are resilient because
of their diversity of species, with many strategies for survival;
but fragile because they may need long periods of time to recover
when damaged or stressed beyond a certain point, or when key species
or soil are removed. The results may not be merely degradedecosystems,
or the loss of species, but large&#173;scale destabilization of
landscapes, with major impacts on people living in mountains or
downstream.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Thriving in harsh environments<BR>
</B>
<P>
Most mountains are divided into vegetation belts with specific
temperature and moisture conditions. Overlain on these general
patterns are variations deriving from underlying rocks, the orientation
of slopes, the effects of large&#173; and smallscale disturbances,
and the availability of micro&#173;habitats. Each species occupies
habitats to which it is adapted. Both plants and animals are found
up to 6,000 m in the tropics.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Fragile ecosystems respond highly sensitive and rapidly
to human intervention. Restoring the original state may take a
very long period of time. An experiment in the Schynige Platte
area of the Swiss Alps in the 1930s shows that the natural plant
community responds to application of fertilizer within 3 and 5
years. Restoring the original plant community may take more than
100 years. In this experiment, all the endangered 'red&#173;list'
species disappeared with the application of fertilizer. Inappropriate
human intervention, here excess Nfertilizer, resulted in a 90%
loss of biodiversity. (O. Hegg)<BR>

<B>Surviving human activities<BR>
</B>
<P>
Continued human intervention is necessary for some species to
survive; such as plants in meadows, where natural herbivores have
been replaced by grazing or mowing over centuries. However, human
activities endanger many mountain ecosystems and species. Wetlands
are particularly vulnerable; through dam construction, drainage,
pollution, and the introduction of alien species. Mountain forests
may be lost or completely changed through clearing for agriculture
and plantations and cutting for timber and fuelwood, and the introduction
of new species. Medicinal and ornamental plants and mushrooms
may be collected to extinction. Quarrying and road construction
can remove the habitat of cliff species. Downhill skiing may disturb
animals and birds, and damage vegetation.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>The risks of climate change<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Climate change has significant implications for mountain people
and billions living downstream. Major changes in rainfall and
snowfall patterns, and more extreme events, such as floods and
avalanches, are likely. Governments and many industries &#173;
agriculture, energy, forestry, insurance &#173; are developing
policies for areas in the mountains and lowlands can not assume
that future climates will be similar to recent history. Regarding
risk mitigation and longtermplanning, scenarios of positive and
negative impacts of climate change are needed.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Change Scenario</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>+3.5&#176; C / +10% Precipitation</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With a 3.5&#176;C increase in annual temperature,
and a 10% increase in precipitation, vegetation belts will move
upwards. Ecological conditions will change and some habitats may
disappear. As many species are trapped in the &quot;islands. of
mountains, they may be endangered if their habitat vanishes. (Patrick
N. Halpin)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>A complex future<BR>
</B>
<P>
Detailed predictions of future mountain climates are difficult,
due to the complexity of mountain regions and inadequate long&#173;term
data. Likely changes include shifts in major storm tracks and
earlier snowmelt. Changes in runoff are expected to affect the
lowlands, especially dry areas fed by mountain snowmelt. Higher
temperatures and carbon dioxide may result in more productive
agriculture and forestry; but weeds, pests, and diseases may prosper,
and fires may increase. Higher temperatures may reduce permafrost
areas and foster slope processes such as rock falls and landslides.
Disease&#173;carrying organisms may also move upwards. In winter,
changes in the distribution and timing of snowfall and snowmelt
may significantly affect the ski tourism. On the other hand, the
transport sector may benefit from longer snow&#173;free periods.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Flexibility for the future<BR>
</B>
<P>
Cooperation and diverse, flexible management systems will be increasingly
important. However, climate change is only one factor to be considered
for sustainable development; its benefits and negative impacts
will interact in complex ways.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There is &quot;a discernible human influence on global
climate&quot;: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 1996.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mountains are sensitive early warning systems for
climate change. Nearly all glaciers, except for some In Norway
and western North America, are retreating. One is the Zongo glacier,
Bolivia (left), which provides water for large areas. The glaciers
of Kilimanjaro (left) have lost more than half of their area since
the 1880s.<BR>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>Mountain peoples are increasingly integrated into the modern
world. They face many challenges in maintaining their cultural
identity and self&#173;confidence, which are essential for their
proper development. These need to be fostered not only from within,
but also from outside the mountains, particularly from urban centres
and governments.<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The mountains of western Central Asia are one of
the major centres of linguistic diversity. Other centres of ethnic
diversity include the eastern Caucasus and the Altai. (Source:

<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Maintaining identity<BR>
</B>
<P>
While most distinct mountain peoples are relatively few in number,
some large groups exist, such as the Quechua (Andes), Amhars (Ethiopia),
and Tibetans. Some major centres of culture have been in mountains;
others have been areas of refuge for those whose language, religion,
or race differed from those of a region's dominant groups. Many
mountain people have intentionally maintained their cultural identity
by keeping not only a physical, but a socio&#173;cultural, distance
from their neighbours.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Factors of loss<BR>
</B>
<P>
Modern <B>transport and communication </B>vastly increase the
mobility of people, goods, and ideas. External ideas brought by
returning migrants, tourists, investors, or telecommunications
also lead to losses of cultural diversity. This concerns not only
languages, customs, costumes, or architecture, but also land practices,
crop varieties, cultivation methods and land ownership.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Mountain societies and economies<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Working together:</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Mutual aid and common property<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>Many tasks required to ensure the continuity of mountain communities
exceed the abilities of individuals and families. Systems of mutual
aid and common property have evolved in concert with fixed and
changing local conditions. They are generally far more appropriate
for sustainable mountain development than regulations and institutional
systems elaborated by central administrations.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Thriving in a fragile environment<BR>
</B>
<P>
While agricultural land is generally privately&#173;owned, its
productive use may only be possible when families work together
to construct and maintain terraces and irrigation systems and,
often, to plant and harvest crops. Joint ownership and management
are also valuable in using forest resources and pastures sustainably.
Such common&#173;property resources are governed by strict rules
defining individual rights and responsibilities. Protecting mountain
communities, access routes, transit corridors and infrastructure
from natural hazards also involves communal tasks, such as constructing
defence structures and planting trees; as well as the knowledgeable
siting of buildings and infrastructure..<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Choosing the right innovations<BR>
</B>
<P>
These communal institutions and systems are based on centuries
of local experience. Today, many are threatened, or have been
lost; through technical progress, increased government influence,
better communication, and economic forces. Not all endeavours
can be implemented locally; for example, large construction projects.
The division of labour and investment between public and private
entities and self&#173;help groups must be carefully defined for
each mountain community and region. Innovations in institutional
structures, technical knowledge, and organizational management
are often necessary to ensure better responses to changing situations,
however, they must be locally suported.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Terraces as in the Mandara Mountains, Cameroon, are

<FONT SIZE=5>Managing and living in the mountain landscape<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
For most mountain inhabitants of developing countries, fields,
grazing land, and forests are their main workplaces and sources
of sustenance. Their way of life is characterized by the complementary
use of different attitudinal zones, whose use is conditioned by
physical factors and infrastructure constructed over generations.
Pressures to intensify the use of these landscapes threaten their
careful management, on which not only mountain people, but millions
downstream, depend.<BR>

<P>
<B>Diversified inter&#173;connected systems<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mountain economies in developing countries are primarily based
on local resources and driven by local needs. Few people are exclusively
,,farmers&quot; or ,,foresters&quot;. Most individuals pursue
myriad activities in an agro&#173;silvo&#173;pastoral system.
The forests provide essential inputs to agriculture, and many
other resources such as animal fodder, timber, non&#173;wood products
for food or income, and fuelwood.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Mountain societies and economies<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Adapting to change?<BR>
</B>
<P>
The vast array of mountain land&#173;use systems reflects diverse
physical and cultural conditions. Today, the rates of change mountain
people are experiencing are too rapid to allow them to evolve
effective adaptive strategies. Larger populations, unsustainable
poverty alleviation policies and desires for higher income lead
to increases in demand, often resulting in soil nutrient depletion,
soil erosion and ultimately lower crop yields. Outmigration can
decrease demand, and is widespread, but often at the expense of
maintaining the land. Upgrading the production base through terracing
or irrigation is often not possible due to lacking man power.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Paths to intensification<BR>
</B>
<P>
Where possible, new ways to intensify the use of entire mountain
landscapes are needed. This will involve among others development
planners, extension agents, and foresters. But they must understand
the complex systems and needs of local people. The introduction
of ecologically and culturally appropriate species or varieties,
combined with suitable production, harvesting, storage and marketing
strategies, may permit increased benefits. However, all long&#173;term
investments also in agriculture and forestry are only possible
when property rights are guaranteed.<BR>
<P>
<B>Agriculture and forestry: pillars of mountain communities<BR>
</B>
<P>
Costs of production in agriculture and forestry are generally
higher in mountains, and transport to markets more expensive.
Nonetheless, due to increasing demands for products, unsatisfied
by the lowlands, intensification in both sectors is occurring.
This often results in more serious environmental costs and long
term impairment of productivity. On the other abandonment of steeplands
is occurring, and forest area is increasing through natural regrowth
or state and private reforestation programs. In some countries
mountain farmers are finding a risk&#173;reduction agriculture
/forestry combination by planting trees on their farms. Community
management of forests as a replacement of failed or inadequate
government control is also improving the picture.<BR>
<P>
<B>Recognizing linkages<BR>
</B>
<P>
High&#173;quality agricultural goods and forest products may increase
competitiveness, particularly when new technologies are used.
Yet such primary activities, alone, are rarely a basis for sustainable
mountain development. Mountain agriculture and forestry should
no longer be treated independently. Mountain people must by compensated
for the inherent disadvantages of their environments and the many
services they provide to wider communities by maintaining mountain
landscapes. This requires the integration of environmental externalities
into agricultural and other sectoral policies, and support for
multi&#173;functional economies. Otherwise, as has begun in many
regions, depopulation will occur, with unpredictable consequences
for all those downstream<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The multifunctional landscape of Pays d' Enhaut,

<FONT SIZE=2>Tropical upland forests are disappearing at 1.1%
per year, faster than any other forest biome. The causes include
from small&#173;scale clearing for agriculture to large&#173;scale

<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Comparative inequalities<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Most mountain people have lower standards of living than people
in the neighbouring lowlands. Lower standards of living include
restricted access to education, capital for investments and off&#173;farm
job opportunities. This is not always true in tropical and subtropical
areas, where mountains provide more favourable conditions for
life. Even so, mountain people are typically marginalized through
economic and political factors, which compound the environmental
constraints. Within every mountain region, there are significant
ethnic, generational, and gender inequalities. Sustainable mountain
development implies the reduction of these inequalities; otherwise,
extensive environmental deterioration is likely.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Recognizing women's roles<BR>
</B>
<P>
In the mountain societies of developing countries, women are responsible
for most of the farming, and the nurturing of future generations.
Their importance is not reflected in their access to education,
social services, credit, land and other assets, and technologies.
These disparities begin in childhood, and continue through their
lives. Women occupy a disproportionate number of low&#173;paid
and labour&#173;intensive jobs; cannot obtain credit even when
they are the main food producers; and rarely have major decision&#173;making
roles outside their families, or benefit equitably from inheritance.
A central focus of mountain development plans should be to decrease
these inequities, aiming at gender&#173;balanced development.
This will require a strong continuation of the initiated shift
in the policies and actions of aid agencies, which have often
further weakened the status of women.<BR>

<P>
<B>Mountains are often regarded as barriers to communication.
Yet most are traversed by important trade routes, often with major
trading centres for products from the mountains and the adjacent
plains. The opening of ways into and through the mountains has
largely been driven by the demands of lowland economies and political
realities. Examples are the export of minerals, wood, or animals;
the transit of goods; access for tourism, and strategic control!
along national frontiers, important transit roads and passes.

Mountain inhabitants may gain opportunities for employment, both
as commuters to jobs in the lowlands, and in new production and
service industries. Yet, improved access along one valley may
draw resources and people from adjacent valleys, causing environmental
and societal change. Major transit routes mainly benefit those
outside the mountains. However, people living close to these routes
suffer negative impacts, such as noise and air pollution.  Construction
of mountain roads may also change surface runoff and threaten

<B>The decline of the production potential<BR>
</B>
<P>
Industrial and agricultural goods from mountain regions rarely
have absolute cost advantages because of high production and transport
costs, so that imported goods are&#173;cheaper. When goods are
produced in the mountains at a cost disadvantage in an attempt
to compete, mountain workers receive lower salaries than equally
qualified workers in neighbouring lowlands. With lower incomes,
mountain people have lower savings; and imported goods are expensive
In relation to Income. The lack of savings tends to limit investments
in agriculture and other sectors, leading to stagnating or declining
economies with a low added value. Consequently, mountain areas
are likely to remain agrarian. This will further disadvantage
them as, following global trade liberalization, agricultural prices
tend to decline even more relatively.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>The need of government action<BR>
</B>
<P>
In the absence of government intentention, trade liberalization
is likely to hit areas most with high employment in agriculture,
which suffer in many cases from high population growth and limited
opportunities for migration; this, leading to a stronger reliance
on food imports. Conversely, mountain areas with low population
growth and multi&#173;sectoral economies should be affected less.
Nevertheless, many governments will have to develop appropriate
policies to maintain the region's production potential.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>A particularly high proportion of wars and conflicts take place
in mountain regions, usually because of interactions with lowland
areas. As mountain communities have limited means to cope with
environmental challenges, their relations to the lowlands may
rapidly precipitate into crisis when the socio&#173;ecological
balance is disturbed. Sustainable mountain development is a vital
means for preventing and managing conflict.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Sources of tension<BR>
</B>
<P>
Although difficult to access, mountain regions have always inter&#173;related
with neighbouring foothills and plains, whether ecologically,
through the water cycle; or socio&#173;economically: transhumance,
providing labour, and offering transportation routes. Environmental
change and the shortage of resources &#173; such as fertile land,
water, forests &#173; are deepening poverty, widening social divides,
disrupting migration patterns, and causing new population movements.
Long&#173;established social and political structures are being
challenged. Consequences include international disputes over water
resources and, within States, growing tensions along societal
boundaries such as classes, or ethnic and tribal groups: the main
causes of many, if not most, internal wars.<BR>
<P>
<B>Avoiding stresses<BR>
</B>
<P>
Where ecology is fragile, social peace is also fragile, and resources
must be shared equitably to avoid conflict. The management of
mountain conflicts should focus on the economic and environmental
roots of multiple stress on highland&#173;lowland interactions.
Participatory approaches, coupled with adapting established regulations
of access to resources to new conditions, are most likely to produce
sustainable and realistic solutions.<BR>

</B>
<P>
Mountains have higher precipitation than surrounding lowlands.
Much of this precipitation falls as snow, which is released as
meltwater in spring and summer. This is particularly important
when the rivers reach to semi&#173;arid and arid regions with
high evaporation rates and demands for irrigation water in summer.
All of the world's largest rivers originate in the mountains.
<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Planning of reselvoils must consider all aspects
of dynamic mountain environments. Sedimentation rates in the Kulekhani
reservoir, Nepal, built to provide hydro&#173;electnc power for
Kathmandu, have been much higher than expected. Two&#173;thirds
of its capacity were lost in the first 13 years of operanon, three&#173;quarters
of this in 1993, when 500 mm precipitation fell in a single storm

Water in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs is not only available for
consumption, but provides a major source of energy. For instance,
the hydropower potential of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Indus,
rising in the Himalaya, is enormous. However, planning the sustainable
management of water resources requires adequate information and
knowledge, which is generally lacking. The hydrological observation
networks in mountains worldwide are in decline (WMO).<BR>

136 km3 of water are stored in lakes and reservoirs, such as the
Oberaar reservoir shown here; another 74 km3 are stored in glaciers.

<P>
<B>Driven by the growth of global consumption, modern technology
&#173;for mineral exploration and extraction, and the construction
of infrastructure &#173; has made the most remote mountain areas
accessible and profitable for mining. Agenda 21 calls on national
governments and multinational mining companies to 'pray a major
role in reducing Impacts on resource use and the environment'.
This includes responsibility to minimize the social and cultural
effects of mining.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Mining at the limits<BR>
</B>
<P>
Many mines are located at high altitudes with harsh climates and
natural hazards. These pose significant risks to long, circuitous
access roads, bridges, infrastructure and camps. Present mining
is challenged by avoiding air pollution, the failure of tailings,
and percolation of toxic mine drainage. Many of these problems
remain after mining has finished, and rehabilitation of mining
sites is often very difficult. High altitudes also mean that labour
&#173; mechanical power and human effort &#173; is significantly
reduced; for instance, the oxygen concentration at 5000 m is only
half that at sea level.<BR>
<P>
<B>Limited local benefits<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mining in remote areas may result in severe social disintegration
and changes of local economies. Almost everything &#173;fuel,
food, timber, machinery&#173; is imported. Often, the labour force
must also be imported, resulting in ethnic enclaves in culturally
different environments. Some miners work long shifts for a few
days, weeks or even months, and are sometimes hundreds of kilometers
away from their families.<BR>

Borneo, <FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>and Papua&#173;New Guinea. Many secondary
centres are found in subtropical arid <FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>mountains:
the Rocky Mountains, the central Sahara, and Central Asia. Mountains
are also important centers of crop variety, a major issue of mountain
agriculture.  The number of vascular plant species is closely
correlated to total species diversity.  Thus the map may serve
as a first approximation of global biodiversity.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Maintaining biological and landscape diversity
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>After millenia of human modification of the Earth's ecosystems,
mountain areas are refuges for a great wealth of endemic species,
specialized ecosystems, and remarkable landscapes. A common approach
to conserving this biological and landscape diversity has been
to establish national parks, nature reserves, and other protected
areas. More recent approaches recognise that biological and landscope
diversity must also be conserved on land under human&#173;use
regimes of agriculture and forestry, and that the private sector
can be a major conserver of these values.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Biodiversity richness<BR>
</B>
<P>
Tropical mountains include major centres of global biodiversity;
other important centres are found in arid subtropical mountains.
The high biodiversity is to a large extent due to the different
climatic attitudinal belts, the different conditions on different
sides of the mountain and the many microhabitats. Isolated mountains
(such as Kilimanjaro) also result in a high proportion of endemic
species.<BR>
<P>
<B>Mountain protected areas<BR>
</B>
<P>
Many of the mountain areas of greatest biological and landscape
diversity are protected areas, often with additional international
status: 39 World Heritage Sites and 141 Biosphere Reserves. Such
areas can protect endemic and threatened species, offer recreation
and tourism opportunities, and be used to monitor environmental
changes. These functions are best achieved when protected areas
also provide regional or transboundary mechanisms for cooperation.
This is especially critical in mountain areas, where administrative
boundaries divide ecosystems. People, wildlife, fires, diseases,
air pollution regularly cross administrative and ecological boundaries.
<BR>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Kilimanjaro is an example of an ,,island&quot;

<P>
<B>Joint management<BR>
</B>
<P>
Recent conservation approaches stress the linkages between biological
and cultural diversity. Many mountain areas which are now legally
protected have long been used e.g. for collecting plants and forest
products, religious ceremonies, and grazing. Prohibiting these
uses, or recreation, is not practicable or desirable. On the contrary,
implementing and monitoring regional conservation policies jointly
with local and other stakeholders should be emphasized. Outside
of protected areas, needs to provide grazing for wild animals,
or corridors for migration, may influence the management and use
of certain areas, in buffer zones of conservation.<BR>

Most mountain protected areas were established to protect isolated
areas, usually only at high elevations above the agriculture and
forestry belt. Unfortunately, relatively ,,small islands&quot;
of nature protection are inadequate for long&#173;term conservation
of biological diversity; especially if appropriate habitat for
important species shrinks because of climate change. Animals and
plants must have opportunities to migrate not only up and down,
but also along and between mountain ranges. This requires migration
corridors between isolated habitats and solitary protected areas.

people face many challenges in integrating this diverse and complex

Tourism provides a vast range of ,,products&quot; to millions

of many of them. Often, far wider areas than tourists visit are
affected. Tourism often leads to substantial tensions and inequities,
for instance, between those employed in traditional economic activities
and those with high&#173;paying tourist jobs, or because prices
for housing, goods and infrastructure increase.<BR>
<P>
<B>Balancing benefits and costs<BR>
</B>
<P>
While the diversity of landscapes, opportunities for sports, and
,,living cultural resources&quot; attract people to mountains,
tourism almost inevitably changes these attractants. It can stimulate
sustainable mountain development: through employment, the production
of food and handicrafts, or transfer payments from communities
which benefit directly from tourist income to those which maintain
the landscape &#173; the ,,capital&quot; of tourism. The potential
environmental impacts may provide opportunities to develop and
test new technologies and strategies: for water and waste treatment,
energy production and utilisation, or food production.<BR>

<P>
<B>Ensuring compatibility<BR>
</B>
<P>
Tourism is never free&#173;standing, and is introduced into communities
with existing cultural norms and economic activities. The infrastructure
constructed in a landscape is often used for many other purposes.
Therefore, development of policies and plans must be based on
a realistic assessment of the relative social and environmental
compatibilities of different tourist and other economic activities,
and involve local communities and other stakeholders at all stages
from initial definition to implementation.

roles of women should be recognized by ensuring their participation

</B>
<P>
<B>Finding a balance<BR>

<P>
Mountain people's intimate knowledge of their environment has
produced diverse cultural behaviours, with a common denominator:
sensitivity for environmentally practicable action. This recognition
of a necessary balance between nature and human exploitation is
vital for humankind, faced with major changes and uncertainties.
Mountain women play the dominant role in transmitting local culture,
know&#173;how, behaviour, and customs to their children. This
role is further enhanced when, as often, men are absent for many
months, as economic migrants.<BR>
<P>
<B>Investments in a time of change<BR>
</B>

Local knowledge and experience are keys to sustaining ecosystems,
livelihood, and production. However, they must be cautiously integrated
with new techniques and research findings. This requires a focus
on practical training and education, if possible on&#173;site
in the mountains. This will be costly, given the sparse distribution
and isolation of many mountain populations. Governments must be
ready to make proportionately greater investments for training
and education in mountain regions, and support their communities
in maintaining and transmitting to their children their local
languages, knowledge, and culture.<BR>

Too often we find mountain projects without the necessary scientific

only a fewpercentsof the costs were spent for a careful scientific
study of the location and the local hazardous processes beforehand.
<P>
Many mountain&#173;specific problems require scientific work:
E.g. natural hazards and changing environmental conditions, nature
conservation and sustainable resource use, economic marginalisation
and possible mechanisms for the compensation of disadvantages,
regional development planning and its impact at the community
level, etc. Interdisciplinary approaches are fundamental and the
involvement of local men and women strengthens human resource
development and capacity&#173;building, even on a community level.
<P>
Chapter 13 demands pilot projects in the framework of integrated
watershed development programmer. Networks for such pilot projects
in different countries of a regional mountain system, executed
with comparable objectives, methods, and techniques, lead not
only to broader knowledge, but also to scientific co&#173;operation,
which is important for a free flow of information across borders.

Mountain research reaches far back into the last centuries. The

dangers. Whereas glacial advances or retreats were still considered
an act of God in past centuries, they have now become an important
indicator of climatic oscillations or even climate change.

of climate and global change, we need a mountain research network
with monitoring stations, not only in the industrialized countries,
but especially in the most vulnerable tropical mountain systems.
 This is not a <FONT SIZE=2>wish of an ivory tower science, it
is much more an urgent need to understand and if possible to predict
potential changes: E.g. for water and energy supply, biodiversity
resources, risks of erosion and natural hazards, and especially
also for the living conditions of the local population like agriculture,
tourism, traffic, etc.<BR>

are principally responsible for environmental degradation in the
mountains. (Source: Agence Regionale pour l'Environnement, Region

flexible enough, and influenced by other considerations.<BR>

<P>
<B>Instruments for sustainable mountain development<BR>
</B>
<P>
The State's essential role stems from its political function and
financial power. It has to define, through means as participatory
as possible, a normative framework and a general policy for sustainable
mountain development; implement this policy; control its application;
evaluate its results; and play the role of arbiter. To execute
these tasks, many tools with an enormous influence on the future
of mountain regions are available. Legal instruments include sectoral,
integrated, and regional development policies; and the definition
and protection of property rights. Economic and financial instruments
include investment in infrastructure and other projects; direct
financial support (subsidies, compensation, incentives through
grants and loans); adapted taxation policies; fair pricing; and
financial equalization schemes.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5>the stewards of mountain resources<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Many goods produced by mountain communities &#173; timber,
fuelwood, high quality water, agricultural products, minerals
&#173; have measurable economic value. Through managing local
resources, mountain people also provide other goods and services
whose value is not easily measured in monetary terms, although
their lack can: for instance, the damage caused by floods, ill&#173;health
from polluted water; or the loss of species. However, there are
no free goods: the provision of all goods and services has certain
costs, whether compensated or hidden.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>Setting values for stewardship<BR>
</B>
<P>
As internal and external pressures mount, mountain people are
often forced to deplete resources of regional, national, and global
significance for short&#173;term economic gain. If they are to
be adequately compensated for ensuring the long&#173;term provision
of goods and services to wider communities, these goods and services
must first be identified and valued. Various fees and taxes can
then be used to enable mountain people to capture a greater proportion
of this value. To be effective, fees and taxes must be set at
an appropriate level, accurately reflecting the costs of maintaining
and protecting a particular resource. The revenue must be equitably
distributed among the concerned community, providing incentives
to continue their stewardship role.<BR>

<P>
<B>Mountain communities face many challenges to competing in the
market place: high production costs, limited credit facilities,
unequal or unfavourable access to markets. Nevertheless, both
the diversity of mountain environments and cultures, and physical
constraints permitting the production of specific goods, provide
potential comparative advantage and opportunities to strengthen
mountain economies and communities.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Turning disadvantage to advantage<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Comparative advantages of mountain environments and cultures include:
highquality goods, particularly foodstuffs and handicrafts, often
produced in limited areas; local transformation of raw material;
and small&#173;scale systems which are economically and ecologically
preferable to large&#173;scale systems. Even in a global economy,
mountain communities can benefit from ,,geographical indications&quot;
or ,,regional trademarks&quot; &#173; exclusive rights to the
production and sale of highquality products from a specific, guaranteed
location &#173; which all members of the World Trade Organization
are required to protect.<BR>

major food crops originated in mountain areas. They are now important
sources of molecular and genetic diversity for many industries,
with private companies collaborating with mountain institutions
to maximize their ability to discover promising chemicals or genes.
Local people are being trained and employed as ,,parataxonomists&quot;
to collect and characterize genetic resources. Mountain communities
may benefit from their discovery and use through the payment of

<FONT SIZE=5>Decentralization, empowerment, and capacity building
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>The decentralization of power &#173; from capital cities to
mountain regions, towns, and villages &#173; can be one of the
best ways to empower mountain inhabitants, reduce costs, and increase
efficiency. Empowerment includes secure property rights; access
to financial resources, markets, information, training, and equitable
participation in political decision&#173;making. Unless mountain
communities are empowered, they will increasingly be unable to
act as the stewards of mountain resources</B>.<BR>
<P>
<B>Sharing responsibility<BR>
</B>
<P>
NGOs and organizations for mutual aid are effective, but only
reach a small proportion of those living in poverty. They must
therefore be part of wider strategies for sustainable mountain
development, with a reasonable distribution of responsibilities
between governments, public agencies, and scientific, multilateral,
community, and private organizations. Subsidiarityshould be a
guiding principle, with public structures responsible only for
tasks that cannot be satisfactorily devolved. State involvement
is often necessary in defining property rights. When these are
secure, owners &#173; private individuals or community groups
&#173; have far greater incentives to manage resources sustainably.
<BR>
<P>
<B>Training and education<BR>
</B>
<P>
The decentralized implementation of action programmes and development
plans requires reliable institutions with strong leaders. Mountain
decision&#173;makers must be thoroughly trained in participatory
approaches, management, and planning. Yet, for most mountain people,
access to training, especially high&#173;level training, is costly
and difficult.. Consequently, policies for sustainable mountain
development should offer mountain people opportunities and financial
means for training and education equivalent to those accessible
to people in lowland and urban areas. Such training fosters the
use of local experts, rather than expensive consultants.<BR>
<P>
<B>Access to knowledge and information<BR>
</B>
<P>
To define appropriate strategies for sustainable mountain development,
all stakeholders must understand and support what is being done.
However, access to relevant knowledge and information is often
limited to governmental and academic institutions, with minimal
or no flow to other agencies, NGOs, or local communities and institutions.
Stakeholders also need information to monitor and evaluate these
strategies; particularly criteria and indicators of environmental
and societal change which can be applied reliably, rapidly, and
economically.<BR>

<P>
<B>Identifying issues and solutions<BR>
</B>
<P>
Chapter 13 of ,,Agenda 21&quot; has been an important catalyst
to governmental consideration of sustainable mountain development
around the world. In the five years since the Rio ,,Earth Summit&quot;,
various regional initiatives have started or been strengthened.
Under the auspices of FAO, Task Manager for Chapter 13, regional
inter&#173;governmental consultations have taken place for Africa,
Asia/Pacific, Europe, and Latin America, involving representatives
of 62 governments. These consultations have identified major issues
and existing initiatives for sustainable mountain developments
and stimulated national mountain policies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Mechanisms for regional cooperation<BR>
</B>
<P>
The most formal mechanism for regional cooperation is a convention.
Only one convention for a mountain chain exists to date: the Alpine
Convention, which entered into force in 1995. In theJura, Pyrenees,
and the western, central, and eastern Alps, regional governments
have established ,,Working Communities&quot; which provide mechanisms
for cooperation and harmonization of policies and research.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>International cooperation<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>Global organizations and initiatives<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Global organizations have major roles to play in sustainable
mountain development. Trends in international trade and multilateral
funding are of central importance in defining future development
paths, and complementarities between global initiatives should
be encouraged.<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The role of international trade<BR>
</B>
<P>
Despite attempts to integrate social and environmental factors
into measures of development, it is still largely defined in economic
terms. The World Trade Organization &#173; and the wider context
of trade liberalization, globalization, and privatization &#173;
are critical factors. Yet, as long as short&#173;term benefits
outweigh longterm impacts, market policies and practices generally
work against the interest of poorer countries and marginalized
re&quot;ions, such as mountain areas. Growth should be sustainable;
and the distribution of its benefits &#173; and structural adjustments
&#173; should also serve poor people.<BR>
<P>
<B>Recognizing linkages<BR>
</B>
<P>
Each chapter of ,,Agenda 21&quot; has been implemented separately.
Yet many are cross&#173;sectoral, and there are clear linkages
between thematic chapters. Sustainable mountain development cannot
be
<P>
sectoral, and the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD)
should foster the integration of actions taken under individual
chapters. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) may be an important
mechanism for financing such integrated projects.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>To assure the competitiveness of mountain production,
action is needed at international, national, and local levels,
especially by integrating full social costs in pricing.<BR>

<B>The Mountain Forum<BR>
</B>
<P>
At the first meeting of the ad hoc interagency group for follow&#173;up
to Chapter 13, in 1994, NGOs were accepted as full partners. In
1995, 1 10 representatives of mountain NGOs, governments, and
international agencies met in Lima, Peru. They established 'The
Mountain Forum', for mutual support and the exchange of experiences
between all actors &#173; organizations and individuals &#173;
concerned with sustainable mountain development. Currently facilitated
by 'The Mountain Institute' (Virginia, USA), it has a decentralized
structure, with regional focal points &#173; so far, in the Asia/Pacific
and Latin American regions &#173; coordinating networking activities.
There is much room for expansion, for instance through involving
other networks, such as mountaineering and business associations,
and the private sector in general.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Investing in mountains<BR>
</B>
<P>
During summer 1996, over 200 people from 23 countries participated
in a Mountain Forum electronic conference: ,,Investing in Mountains&quot;.
They identified many innovative mechanisms for financing sustainable
mountain development. These often involve the private sector;
industries which rely on mountain resources but are based in lowland
areas could play a far greater role. As well as paying compensation
for using resources, companies can adopt or sponsor mountain communities
or institutions. Other private local initiatives include twinning
of communities, and support from tourism companies for conservation
projects and water, education, health facilities.<BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A survey of 1,000 NGOs concerned with European mountain
areas showed a strong belief that local people and organizations
and NGOs are key actors for a sustainable future. These results
were discussed by over 100 participants. from 24 countries, at

Mountain Development in Toulouse, France.<BR>

<P>
<B>Chapter 13 of ,,Agenda 21&quot; was prepared in a short time,
with little input from NGOs and mountain inhabitants. But follow&#173;up
and review procedures have involved a very wide range of concerned
actors. The inter&#173;governmental and non&#173;governmental
consultations, and other activities, have increased recognition
of the distinct qualities of mountain areas and their need for
special attention, and produced important new ideas and recommendations.

</B>
<P>
<B>Continuing the implementation<BR>
</B>
<P>
Implementation of Chapter 13 has followed a unique path, including
diverse initiatives at many levels, sometimes coordinated, sometimes
not. The common thread is the commitment of all actors to sustainable
mountain development. This approach is less organised and less
hierarchical than for many other chapters of ,,Agenda 21&quot;,
but it is full of vitality and corresponds to the diversity of
mountain regions. This multi&#173;faceted approach must be maintained.

<P>
<B>Committed organizations<BR>
</B>
<P>
Thanks to several UN&#173;organisations, such as UNESCO, UNU,
and FAO, mountain programmes have started long before the Rio
Conference. Before and after Rio they have been joined by a number
of international, governmental, and non&#173;governmental organizations,
such as CIP, ICIMOD, ICRAF, IUCN, TMI, etc.<BR>
<P>
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has been carrying
out the Task Manager role for Chapter 13. The overall objective
is to ensure collaboration and cooperation in the follow up to,
including reporting on, the implementation of Agenda 21 by the
United Nations system. Major responsibilities as Task Manager
include reporting on implementation; strengthening information
exchange; promoting interagency consultation; catalysing joint
activities and programmer; and developing common strategies.<BR>

century<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>There are three priorities that must be attained, at least
in part, if there is to be any chance for sustainable mountain
development being realised during the 21st Century<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>A new perception of the Mountain World<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mountains and Highlands are extremely complex both biophysically
and culturally. Their three&#173;dimensional character, world&#173;wide
occurrence, and political fragmentation, together with their significant
area and population (approximately 25 percent of the world's land
area and 10 percent of total human population),
<P>
demonstrates their centrality in terms of the prospects for a
secure, humane, and prosperous world society. So far, while acquiring
some lip&#173;service after the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, these
&quot;mountain imperatives&quot; have not been incorporated into
the new approaches to sustainable development, the global market,
nor world environmental policy. The recent development of world
trade liberalization and a free&#173;market economy actually accentuate
the competitive disadvantage of the mountain regions.<BR>
<P>
<B>A Revolution in Political Behavior<BR>
</B>
<P>
Mountains and Highlands, as marginal and marginalised regions,
throughout the ages and increasingly toward the end of our millennium,
have usually incurred exploitation by the power centres of the
economically and politically better integrated lowlands. This
has taken the form of damaging, and often ruthless, extraction
of natural resources that has resulted in further marginalisation
of mountain peoples and their comparative neglect during times
of natural and man&#173;made countries, the past 50&#173;year
record of bilateral and multilateral &quot;aid&quot; and &quot;assistance&quot;
is characterised by top&#173;down imposition of &quot;solutions&quot;
from outside the mountains. Some of the results of this, despite
many real advances, have been the loss of self&#173;esteem, disregard
of centuries of accumulated traditional understanding of how to
live in difficult and fragile environments, and collapse, or severe
modification of mountain cultures.<BR>
<P>
Even though this situation is in process of being reversed, especially
since Rio, such progress is being overwhelmed by the growing impacts
of warfare in its many forms. The majority of on&#173;going and
recent armed conflicts in the world impact mountain peoples and
mountain lands out of all proportion to their total numbers and
land area. The so&#173;called &quot;drug war&quot; is merely an
extension of this shame of armed conflict that disproportionately
devastates mountain peoples. The massive displacement of anywhere
from 15 to 30 million refugees across international borders, very
often in mountainous regions, adds to the alarming spread of malnutrition
and disease.<BR>
<P>
In this instance, a revolution in political behaviour is imperative:
within the UN and amongst the so&#173;called rich nations who
claim to provide leadership for world peace. A failure to achieve
a virtual world revolution &#173; a real new world order &#173;
will purchase an enormous penalty, for any collapse of mountain
cultures and their environments and resources will have inexorable
downstream<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Human and Natural Resources for the next century<BR>
</B>
<P>
Sustainable mountain development can proceed if based upon rational
approaches, reduction in unbalanced highlandlowland competitiveness,
and recognition that mountain people are equal in terms of their
humanity and genetically and socially derived abilities. The recent
progress toward local and regional autonomy, at least in some
areas, must be accelerated. Advances in science and technology
must be blended with traditional mountain expertise and experience.
Above all, there must be direct and indirect reciprocity for good
mountain environmental stewardship. Many examples are available
that can be useful in this respect, included direct return payment
for export of mountain water, generation of electricity, minerals
and forest products. But to this must be added compensation for
good agro&#173;pastoral and forestry management as one of the
best forms of upper watershed protection, preservation of biological
diversity and of an aesthetically pleasing landscape and culture
for the increasing numbers of tourists in a rapidly growing urban
world. Above all, the gender, generational, and overall highland&#173;lowland
inequalities must be reduced.<BR>
<P>
Success will require development of a much better understanding
of why mountains and mountain peoples offer particular imperatives
and how to assist in development of their tangible and intangible
resources while avoiding cultural and environmental decline. This
will depend upon an enlarged and targeted programme of mountain
policy, participatory research, heightened awareness, inter&#173;regional
mountain communication and collaboration.<BR>
