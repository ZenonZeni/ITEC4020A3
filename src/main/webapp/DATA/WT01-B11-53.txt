<H1> Whither Wankel? </H1>

<P> <EM> May 25, 1996 </EM>

<P> We find ourselves at a flexion point in the path of the Rotary
Combustion Engine (<A HREF = "rce.html">RCE</A>).  The 1996 RX-7 has
been canceled in North America, but not necessarily the line, though
recent word is grim.  The <A HREF = "rx-01.html">RX-01</A> concept car
is an excellent continuation of Mazda's aggressive and purist approach
to the sports car.

<P> Consider what has been accomplished.  The RCE powered the first
Japanese car to win the <A HREF = "lemans.html">24 Hours of Le Mans</A>.
It has set a world land speed record for its class at 384 kph or 238
mph.  A model RCE has been in production for over 25 years.  The engine
has been adapted to <A HREF = "hydrogen.html">hydrogen</A> fuel and
Diesel operation.  Over one million <A HREF = "rx-7.html">RX-7</A>
sports cars have been produced with rotary combustion engines.

<P> These milestones have been achieved in about one third of the
development time of five major propulsion systems, three of which are
internal combustion piston engines (Figure).  The history is even more
severe since development has mostly been driven by two companies: <A
HREF = "nsu.html">NSU</A> and Mazda, while the dozens of other companies
have almost exclusively focused on piston engines.  Furthermore, the
RCE has been excluded or penalized by most if not all racing bodies,
strangling research and development.

<IMG SRC = "../Images/propuls.gif" WIDTH = 519 HEIGHT = 206>

<P> Four manufacturers currently produce engines (<A HREF =
"mazda.html">Mazda</A>, Moller, <A HREF = "mid-west.html">Mid
West</A>, and <A HREF = "graupner.html">OS/Graupner</A>) that are being
installed in cars, boats, planes, powered lift craft, and toys.  The 5
cc OS/Graupner Wankel model engine holds two distinctions: the smallest,
and the longest in production.  Unfortunately, the first three are in
transient positions.  Mid West is the result of several corporate
resuscitations and reorganizations.  Moller is newly manufacturing
engines.  Mazda is losing money and has to answer more and more to Ford.

<P> What of the future?  The Mazda RX-01 with MSPRE engine is an obvious
candidate to turn into a sports car that I believe would sell well if
the price were reasonable.  Mid West and Moller engines have the
potential to perform well in aircraft applications.

<P> One of the more interesting potentials is the Ultra Low Emissions
Hydrogen RCE.  It provides the best combination of high performance
and low emissions.

<P> Alan Marr.
