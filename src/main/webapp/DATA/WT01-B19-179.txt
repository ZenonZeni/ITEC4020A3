<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Marijuana Arrests For 1995
Most Ever</b></font><b><br>
FBI Data Confirm Clinton's Marijuana War To Be Toughest Yet</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">An estimated* <b>588,963 total marijuana arrests</b>
were made by state and local law enforcement during 1995,
according to the latest edition of the FBI <i>Uniform Crime
Report</i>.&nbsp; This figure is an 18 percent increase above the
1994 level and pushes the total number of marijuana arrests under
the Clinton administration to a staggering 1,450,751.&nbsp; The
1995 yearly arrest total for marijuana violations is the highest
ever recorded by the FBI. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Of the 588,963 arrests made for marijuana in 1995, approximately <b>86
percent (503,350) were for simple &quot;possession.&quot;</b>&nbsp;
The remaining 14 percent (85,614 arrests) were for &quot;sale/manufacture,&quot;
a category that includes <b>all</b> cultivation offenses -- even
those where the marijuana was being grown for personal use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This data confirms what <b>NORML</b> has been maintaining
all along,&quot; states <b>NORML</b>'s Deputy National Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Despite criticism on Capitol Hill
that this present administration is soft on drugs, the raw data
clearly demonstrates that the federal government's war on
marijuana smokers has gotten significantly tougher under
Clinton's regime.&nbsp; <b>These new FBI statistics indicate that
one marijuana user is arrested every 54 seconds in America</b>.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to annual data collected by the FBI, Clinton's three
year average of total marijuana arrests (483,548 arrests per
year) is 30 percent higher than the average number of yearly
arrests under the Bush administration (338,998).&nbsp;
&quot;These latest figures expose those who claim that America
has abandoned the drug war under Clinton as the political
charlatans they are,&quot; states <b>NORML</b> Publication's
Director Paul Armentano.&nbsp; &quot;The fact that adolescent use
rates for marijuana are rising at the same time that law
enforcement is arresting record numbers of users affirms <b>NORML</b>'s
long-held belief that marijuana prohibition is not an effective
deterrent to marijuana consumption.&nbsp; Clinton hasn't
abandoned the drug war; the drug war simply isn't working.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Additional statistics gathered from the <i>Uniform Crime Report</i>
reveal <b>that law enforcement made 1.5 million arrests for drug
abuse violations in 1995,</b> the most ever.&nbsp; This figure is
a 7 percent increase above the 1994 level, 41 percent higher than
in 1991, and 65 percent higher than in 1986.&nbsp; The FBI report
further discloses that the number of individuals arrested for
marijuana possession in 1995 virtually equaled the <b><u>combined</u></b>
total number of individuals arrested for possessing heroin,
cocaine, and/or their derivatives. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on marijuana arrests, please contact
Allen St. Pierre or Paul Armentano of </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i>
@ (202) 483-5500.</i></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2">*No arrest data for Kansas,
Montana, and most of Illinois law enforcement agencies were available
to the FBI for 1995.&nbsp; Therefore, arrest totals for these
states were estimated by the FBI for inclusion in the overall
total.</font></p>
