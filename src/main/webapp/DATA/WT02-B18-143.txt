<h2><a name="Q&amp;A">Questions and Answers On Establishing A
Union Safety Committee</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is the role of the Local Safety Committee?</strong></p>
<p>A union Local Safety Committee provides the union with a
formal procedure to discuss membership concerns and problems and
a means for solving those problems. The committee should also be
involved in on-site inspections and investigations of accidents
or incidents.</p>
<p><strong>How should the union committee be organized to meet
their objectives?</strong></p>
<p>The union should fulfill three primary goals in order to have
a strong Local Safety Committee:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Represent all workers</strong>. In order to fully
represent the concerns of the membership, the local union
president should ask for volunteers to serve as the union's
safety representatives throughout the facility. These safety
representatives should represent each craft at the facility so
that all safety and health issues can be brought to the attention
of the committee members.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Maintain communication with all members</strong>.
Sometimes the committee members are not the officers or stewards
of the local union. In these cases, the local union should be up
to date on the safety committee's activities so that they can
fully support the union committee members. The safety committee
should report on its activities at the local union meetings and
get input from the membership. The committee can also communicate
to the membership by creating leaflets and passing them out to
APWU members or posting information on the union bulletin board.
Include articles or start a column in the local newsletter to
cover pressing safety and health issues.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Educate committee participants and the general
membership</strong>. An effective local union committee is an
informed union committee. Committee members should stay current
with new laws, regulations, and policies put out by both OSHA and
USPS. Utilize local resources such as colleges to send members to
safety and health training classes. Participate in COSH
(Committee on Occupational Safety and Health) groups. COSH groups
are coalitions of labor and community organizations concerned
with worker safety and health issues. Create a library of
occupational safety and health resources and publications. Attain
access to management materials. Ultimately, the committee can put
on training programs for the membership to educate them about
safety and health issues.</p>
<p><strong>What are tactics for strengthening the local safety
committee?</strong></p>
<p>Since the committee's main goal is to improve working
conditions, following these guidelines will help achieve this
objective.</p>
<p>1) <strong>Involve the membership</strong>. Talk to fellow
workers about the safety and health problems they think exist in
the workplace. Talk to as many people as possible so that you get
a fair representation of the facility. Some members will want to
play a larger role in the committee than others. Keep this in
mind when assigning tasks and delegating responsibilities. The
committee and the membership participation can grow as it gains
experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>2)<strong> List safety and health problems</strong>. After
discussing working conditions with the membership, document their
concerns so that the committee can get an overview of the
problems they have to deal with.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Prioritize issues</strong>. Sometimes the
membership's concerns do not coincide with the committee's main
issues. For example, the membership may be concerned about
nuisance dust but the committee may want to focus on enforcing
the procedure for handling hazardous materials spills. Since you
are representing the membership, their issues should be dealt
with first.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Gain credibility from the membership and management</strong>.
The committee needs to accomplish its goals before the membership
and management will recognize that the committee means business.
This can be accomplished in two ways:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left">(a) Meet the demands of the membership by
    dealing with their concerns first. Once you earn the support
    of the membership, then management should take you more
    seriously.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>(b) Achieve small victories before tackling larger, more
    difficult problems. Keeping an aisle that leads to a fire
    exit continually clear is easier to accomplish than
    attempting to modify an LSM to eliminate ergonomic hazards.
    As the committee continues to accomplish small improvements
    in the workplace, the committee can deal with management more
    effectively to work on bigger issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How does the committee solve health and safety
problems?</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to <strong>identify the problems or hazards</strong>
in the workplace. Small group discussions with committee members,
safety stewards, and other members can give the committee insight
about what problems exist. Second, <strong>select a problem to
solve or a hazard to abate</strong>. Choose the problem from the
list of priority membership concerns. Third, <strong>develop
strategies</strong> for solving the problem and determine
possible solutions. A plan of action could be as simple as
bringing management's attention to a hazard. Filing Form 1767
&quot;Report of Hazard, Unsafe Condition or Practice&quot; can
alert management to a problem. As a last resort, the committee
may need to resort to legal remedies to solve safety or health
problems. For more complicated problems, keep thorough
documentation to support a grievance or OSHA complaint. Sometimes
other government agencies, such as local fire departments, public
health departments, or building code or zoning agencies can be
helpful in resolving safety or health problems. Fourth, <strong>implement
the strategy and evaluate </strong>your activity regularly. The
safety committee should follow-up on their chosen strategy.
Evaluate the progress and choose another strategy if the original
plan is ineffective. The fifth and final step is to <strong>communicate
the committee's accomplishment</strong> to both management and
the membership.</p>
<p><strong>What are activities that a safety committee can do?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Communicate with the general membership to get
        information.</li>
    <li>Educate themselves and the general membership.</li>
    <li>Develop and conduct training programs.</li>
    <li>Review new machines and work procedures and propose
        changes.</li>
    <li>Know the USPS documents such as the chapter on safety and
        health in the ELM and contract language.</li>
    <li>Keep records.</li>
    <li>Conduct surveys.</li>
    <li>Review injury and illness records (Form CA 1 and 2).</li>
    <li>Maintain a resource center and library.</li>
    <li>Investigate incidents such as a hazardous materials
        spill.</li>
    <li>Conduct inspections using Form 1784-A.</li>
    <li>Sponsor outside events such as CPR training.</li>

<h3>HIV Home Test Kit/Mailer to Be Marketed</h3>
<p>In May 1996, the Food and Drug Administration finally approved
a long-awaited home test kit for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
The home test kit will enable consumers to take their own blood
samples at home and mail them to a medical laboratory in New
Jersey. A week later, they will obtain their test results via
phone, confidentially. They will also receive counseling and
referral services.</p>
<p>Developed by Direct Access Diagnostics, a subsidiary of
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the home test kit contains a lancet to
draw blood, a test card which holds the dried blood sample, a
personal identification number, and non-reusuable packaging and
mailing material. The test kit instructions are printed in both
English and Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>Packaging Exceeds CDC Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The Postal Service requires this home test kit to exceed the
minimum packaging required by the Center for Disease Control. The
envelope that will contain the dried blood sample is lined with
waterproof plastic. This sealed envelope must then be placed in a
cardboard box that is designed to be non-machineable and sent
first class. The APWU has reviewed the package in which the dried
blood sample will be mailed and is satisfied that postal workers
will not be endangered by it.</p>
<p>In order to test the effectiveness of its service. Direct
Access will sell the test kits only in Texas and Florida until
1997. There, the $40 test kit will be sold in pharmacies, college
health centers, public health clinics and through a toll-free
telephone number. If sales are successful, the kits will be
available nationwide in 1997.</p>
<p>Postal workers who will be handling these packages should
monitor the integrity of the mailing containers and report any
problems, such as breakage, to their local union as well as to
management. Local management should develop a procedure for
addressing exposure to damaged packages.</p>

<p><strong><u>Employers Should Reduce Risk Through Ergonomics</u></strong></p>
<h3>NIOSH Questions Effectiveness of Back Belts</h3>
<p>In 1994, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH) issued a report on the use of back belts to
prevent work-related back injuries. In &quot;Workplace Use of
Back Belts: Review and Recommendations,&quot; NIOSH concluded
that the effectiveness of back belts in reducing the risk for
back disorder, injuries, or pain &quot;remains unproven.&quot;
NIOSH formed its conclusions after extensively evaluating back
belt studies documented in scientific literature. Back belts
include abdominal supports or aids, spinal braces, supports,
corsets, weight-lifting belts, and other devices that are
&quot;designed&quot; to support and protect stomach and back
muscles.</p>
<p>While manufacturers contend that back belts prevent back
injuries caused by lifting, pushing, pulling, twisting, or
bending repetitively, NIOSH did not find any scientific evidence
to support this claim. In fact, NIOSH is concerned that back
belts may give workers a false sense of security regarding how
much they can safely lift. Workers who wear back belts may be at
further risk of injury if they attempt to lift bigger weight
loads than they would without the back belt. Furthermore, NIOSH
does not consider back belts to be equipment that effectively
protects workers from on-the-job hazards.</p>
<p>NIOSH reports that the most effective method to eliminate the
hazards associated with lifting is to &quot;redesign the work
environment and the work tasks.&quot; Instead of relying on back
belts to minimize the risk of injury, employers should implement
an ergonomics program to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>identify jobs that put workers at risk for back injuries;</li>
    <li>redesign equipment and work tasks to minimize the weight,
        range of motion, and frequency of lifting;</li>
    <li>train workers in proper lifting techniques and work
        practices; and</li>
    <li>medically monitor workers for signs or symptoms of back
        pain or injury.</li>
</ul>
<p>Management should not make back belts mandatory equipment, and
postal workers should consider NIOSH's recommendations before
wearing back belts. If you want more information on back belts or
ergonomic hazards, contact the APWU Safety and Health Department
or NIOSH (1-800-35-NIOSH).</p>

<p><strong><u>AIDS: A Union Issue, Part I</u></strong></p>
<h3>Dealing With AIDS in the Workplace</h3>
<p><em>Note: This is the first in a series of articles on AIDS
and how it may affect postal workers. Upcoming articles will
focus on the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens standard, how to help
union members with HIV/AIDS, and how to protect yourself and your
family.</em></p>
<p>Every day, 92 Americans die because of AIDS. As the crisis
grows, AIDS is affecting more and more of our union brothers and
sisters; currently, about 1 million Americans are HIV-infected.
Across the country, workers have faced numerous problems on the
job in conjunction with HIV/AIDS. In response, there is a growing
movement in the nation's unions to take action on these problems.</p>
<p><strong>What is AIDS?</strong></p>
<p>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the
human innumodeficiency virus (HIV). The virus enters the body
through the bloodstream and attacks the immune system. The body
loses its ability to fight diseases that would not normally
affect a healthy person. The infections and diseases HIV patients
contract because of their weakened immune response are what make
them sick.</p>
<p>There is usually a long period between the time a person
becomes infected with HIV and the time they begin to show the
symptoms of AIDS, sometimes up to 10 years or more. People
infected with HIV can suffer extreme weight loss, severe and
recurrent pneumonia, brain tumors, rare skin cancer, blindness,
severe nausea, fatigue and other symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Are Postal Workers at Risk?</strong></p>
<p>Postal workers may be exposed to bloodborne
pathogens--disease-causing agents found in the blood--including
HIV, through medical specimens that go through the mail system.
If a spill of such blood or blood-containing materials occurs,
the USPS must comply with the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard set
by OSHA. USPS management instruction, &quot;Bloodborne Disease
Exposure Control Plans&quot; (EL-810-92-4) provides compliance
and policy guidelines for all postal facilities. Details on this
standard are included in part two of this series, &quot;Mail
Dangers: Biological, Infectious Materials.&quot;</p>
<p>Take note that on-the-job exposure to coworkers who have
HIV/AIDS does <em>not</em> constitute a risk of infection. You
cannot be infected by the HIV virus by working with someone who
has it. Despite this fact, many workers living with HIV/AIDS face
discrimination and harassment in the workplace--not only from
their employers, but even from their own union brothers and
sisters!</p>
<p>Fear of working with someone who has HIV/AIDS is
unnecessary--it is impossible to get HIV/AIDS from sharing a
phone, a water fountain, machinery, rest rooms or food. There are
very few ways to contract the AIDS virus.</p>
<p><strong>How is HIV Transmitted?</strong></p>
<p>For HIV to be spread, the infected blood, semen or vaginal
secretions of an infected person must enter the bloodstream of
another person. Outside the body, the virus is very fragile and
is easily killed.</p>
<p>There are only three ways a person can become infected by HIV:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>Sexual contact.</em> The virus is most commonly
    transmitted through contact with an HIV-infected person's
    sexual fluids during vaginal and anal intercourse and oral
    sex.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>Blood-to-blood</em> <em>contact</em>. The virus can be
    transmitted by: sharing or reusing contaminated needles and
    syringes; being accidentally stuck by a contaminated syringe
    or sharp object; having infected blood come into contact with
    damaged skin (cuts, etc.); having large quantities of
    infected blood splashed in the eyes or mouth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>Mother to newborn. </em>A mother who is infected with
    the virus can infect her child during pregnancy or delivery
    or by breast feeding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HIV<em> cannot </em>be spread by coughing or sneezing, sharing
work equipment and rest rooms, shaking hands or hugging. Research
has shown that family members of persons with AIDS have not been
infected with the virus through normal household contact.</p>
<p><strong>Who is at Risk?</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who has unprotected sex with a person whose health
status they don't know about (you can't tell if someone has HIV
by the way they look), or who shares needles, may be at risk to
AIDS exposure. If you don't have sex or if you only have sex with
one mutually faithful partner who you know is not infected, and
neither of you &quot;shoots&quot; drugs, then you are not at
risk. Otherwise, you are at risk, regardless of your age, race,
gender or sexual orientation. Latex condoms are 98 percent
effective in preventing the transmission of HIV if they are used
properly and consistently.</p>
<p><strong>What Must Locals Do?</strong></p>
<p>Unions have a dual responsibility regarding AIDS. They must
both protect the health and safety of workers who may be exposed
to AIDS and other infectious agents on the job, and safeguard the
rights of members who have HIV/AIDS. Fighting against
discrimination has always been central to the union cause. Union
leaders must be ready to reach out to workers with AIDS, and to
battle against possible discrimination.</p>
<p>The rights of HIV-positive postal workers are protected under
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. USPS policy provides for treating
HIV/AIDS the same as any other medical condition in terms of job
assignments and accomodation. The policy also calls for
addressing workplace issues such as misconceptions among workers.
Nevertheless, if people do have a problem with unfair treatment,
locals may need to file grievances on their behalf. When people
with HIV/AIDS face discrimination or harassment, whether by
management or by their coworkers, it is the local's
responsibility to help overcome these difficulties.</p>
<p>In addition, AIDS-infected union members may need assistance
in non-work-related areas, such as filing medical and/or
disability claims, or getting assistance through community
programs and other sources of help. More information on how
locals can help members with HIV/AIDS is included in part three
of this series, &quot;Support Union Members Living with
HIV/AIDS.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Education: Putting Away Fears</strong></p>
<p>Workers who are anxious about contracting HIV/AIDS from
infected coworkers should be reassured that they are in no
danger. Many people may have questions about the disease. Locals
that wish to address this need--whether they are experiencing a
problem or want to avoid one--should arrange AIDS education for
their members. Education can improve the atmosphere at work and
benefit everyone.</p>
<p>Locals can contact the <a
href="http://www.unitedway.org/aids.html">United Way</a>
community labor liaison in their area for educational material
about the AIDS virus and coping with AIDS in the workplace.
Locals may also ask their labor liaison about conducting an AIDS
education seminar for the local membership. Education is also
available through your local <a
href="http://www.redcross.org/hss/hsfacts/fs3501.html">Red Cross</a>,
and there may be other AIDS organizations in your community that
can provide assistance.</p>

<p><strong><u>AIDS: A Union Issue, Part II</u></strong></p>
<h3>Mail Dangers: Biological, Infectious Materials</h3>
<p>In 1992, an improperly prepared, unmarked package containing
live tuberculosis cultures was mailed from a hospital in New York
City to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, GA. En route,
the package was damaged and several of the test tubes containing
the cultures were broken, possibly exposing numerous postal
workers to drug-resistant strains of TB.</p>
<p>This incident points to a serious situation involving
hazardous materials in the mail.</p>
<p>This article will review hazards and procedures related to
bloodborne pathogens and other hazardous materials in the mail
stream. It is important that workers who handle medical mail and
other potentially infectious material, and union representatives,
obtain the original documents dealing with these hazards. This
overview cannot cover the many important details necessary to
protect workers.</p>
<p>Since the National Agreement requires compliance with all OSHA
standards, postal workers who come in contact with biological and
infectious materials in the mail are protected by OSHA's
Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030). Boodborne
pathogens are disease-causing agents found in the blood, and
include, among others, HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and HBV,
which causes hepatitis B, a serious liver disease. There is a
greater risk of contamination by the HBV virus because it can
survive for long periods under many environmental conditions. The
AIDS virus is more fragile, but can still be infectious when
contained in blood samples and other blood-containing fluids.</p>
<p>There are three types of infectious materials that may be sent
through the mail; etiologic agents (infectious agents such as
viruses); diagnostic specimens (such as blood samples); and
biological products (vaccines).</p>
<p><strong>Mailing/Labeling Requirements </strong></p>
<p>Public Health Service regulations require that etiologic
agents must have a proper label, including the
&quot;biohazard&quot; figure. The label is not required on
diagnostic or biological materials, but these should be labeled
for contents.</p>
<p>USPS rules require mail containing such materials to be
packaged in a waterproof inner container, nonpermeable to the
contents, surrounded by sufficient absorbent materials to take up
the contents in case of leakage. The inner container and
cushioning should be placed in an outer nonpermeable container.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/biohaz.jpg" align="bottom"
width="75" height="75"></p>
<p align="center">(biohazard symbol)</p>
<p><strong>Personal Protective Equipment</strong></p>
<p>The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard requires that personal
protective equipment--such as gloves, gowns, face shields and eye
protection--be used when other controls, such as the mailing
requirements noted above, do not eliminate risk. This is the case
in the post office, since materials are not always marked or
contained properly. The USPS must also provide hand-washing
facilities for employees who are occupationally exposed to
bloodborne pathogens.</p>
<p>It is the Postal Service's responsibility to provide
protective equipment and to ensure that it is used properly.</p>
<p>The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard also requires the USPS to
offer hepatitis B vaccine to employees who face occupational
exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials.</p>
<p><strong>Exposure Control Plan</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, MI
EL-810-92-4 requires each postal facility to develop a written
exposure control plan. The plan must be accessible to employees
and their representatives.</p>
<p>If an exposure incident occurs, an incident report (Form 1770)
and an investigation report (Form 1769) must be completed. The
exposed worker must be provided with first aid, medical testing
(results kept confidential), counseling and post-exposure
treatment that includes, if the worker hasn't already received
one, a hepatitis B vaccination. These procedures must be included
in the exposure control plan.</p>
<p><strong>Workers Subject to Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens</strong></p>
<p>According to Management Instruction EL-810-92-4,
&quot;Bloodborne Disease Exposure Control Plans,&quot;
occupationally exposed workers include all persons designated to
clean up spills and leaks of mailed hazardous materials that
include blood and other infectious materials, as well as other
employees outside APWU's bargaining units. Workers who may be
defined as occupationally exposed, depending on individual
circumstances, are clerks, mail handlers and other personnel if
they routinely handle mailed blood specimens or other items
potentially containing bloodborne pathogens, or who handle mailed
or internally generated medical wastes, including sharps.
&quot;Occupational exposure&quot; means reasonably anticipated
contact with blood, or other potentially infectious materials,
that may result from performing one's job.</p>
<p>The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard requires employers to
determine which workers may be exposed and to give information
and training to all such occupationally exposed workers at the
time of initial assignment, and to repeat and update the training
yearly.</p>
<p><strong>USPS Fails to Protect Workers</strong></p>
<p>A recent letter from OSHA to USPS Vice President for Employee
Relations William Henderson shows that the Postal Service has not
been complying with the regulation requiring hepatitis B
vaccination. The letter states, in part, &quot;...the statement
by the USPS that, 'OSHA's determination that persons handling
mail items which may contain bloodborne pathogens are...[at] low
risk,' is without merit and clearly not supported by OSHA's
policy...USPS should identify those workers who must be provided
with a vaccination and make the vaccination available.&quot;</p>
<p>The APWU has filed a national level grievance against the USPS
for failing to comply with the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard,
including training requirements and implementing proper
procedures for handling hazardous materials and bloodborne
pathogens. The case is currently in arbitration.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p>
<p>Postal workers should become familiar with the Bloodborne
Pathogens Standard, your facility's exposure control plan, and
Management Instruction EL-810-92-4. If your job subjects you to
potential exposure to biological materials, make sure the Postal
Service provides you with appropriate training.</p>
<p>The key to eliminating or reducing the risk of exposure is to
take action before an incident occurs. Work with your local to
ensure that the OSHA standard is enforced.</p>

<p><u>AIDS: A Union Issue, Part III</u></p>
<h3>Support Union Members Living With HIV/AIDS</h3>
<p>Many union members have been affected by the AIDS crisis in
America, but even more will be affected in the future. The labor
force is a high-risk group for HIV infection--75 percent of AIDS
cases are among people between the ages of 25 and 44. Unions must
respond.</p>
<p>One of the most important things a local union can do is to be
a source of help and support for union members living with HIV.
When people don't know where else to go for help, the local union
can be an important resource and a good place to start.</p>
<p>Most people infected with HIV remain healthy for about 10
years. However, they need frequent medical attention to monitor
and slow the progression of the disease. Once AIDS-related
problems begin, they will need more frequent medical treatments
and may start using more leave. Their needs in other areas may
increase as well.</p>
<p><strong>What Locals Can Do</strong></p>
<p>Following are some of the ways locals can assist with issues,
problems and needs facing union members with HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>Assist with health care, disability and retirement
paperwork.</strong> Members with HIV may need help with the
selection of an appropriate health plan and supplemental
disability insurance, and with filling out claims. Most people
living with HIV/AIDS want to work as long as possible. However,
eventually they will probably leave on disability. Assistance in
planning that transition would greatly benefit anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Locate sources of support and assistance</strong>.
Identify sources of benefits such as local, state and federal
government programs, the religious community, and AIDS and other
community organizations. Probably the best place to start is the
AFL-CIO Community Services Department. Contact your Central Labor
Council or <a href="http://www.unitedway.org/aids.html">United
Way</a> Community Services liaison.</p>
<p><strong>Protect rights.</strong> Be familiar with members'
rights under the Rehabilitation Act and the Family and Medical
Leave Act, and assure those rights are observed.</p>
<p><strong>Assist with getting reasonable accommodations
implemented</strong>. These may include flexible work schedules
to allow for frequent medical appointments, light duty, and/or
extra break periods and a place to rest.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain confidentiality.</strong> Many workers with
HIV/AIDS have faced harassment from employers and
coworkers--hence, many try to keep their medical information
secret. If coworkers are aware a person is HIV positive, show
visible support--shake hands, ask how they're doing and whether
you can help. Educate others to combat discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>Provide financial assistance</strong>. This is
especially needed in the time period immediately after a person
stops working and before disability and public assistance
programs begin. Bureaucracy often creates this gap, and the delay
can be months long.</p>
<p><strong>Offer emotional support.</strong> Offer support to
members infected and <strong>affected</strong> by HIV. <strong>Affected</strong>
means a loved one has the disease; a member may need help coping
as well as finding assistance for that person.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways Locals Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some other things a person living with HIV may need include:
donations of leave time; legal assistance--for example, for
living wills, wills, power of attorney, insurance disputes, and
discrimination; low-income housing; and assistance with
day-to-day needs such as shopping, cooking and housekeeping.</p>

<p><strong><u>AIDS: A Union Issue, Part IV</u></strong></p>
<h3>Protect Yourself From HIV Infection</h3>
<p>In 1989, Stan Baer, a 14-year-old living in a rural area of
California, had his first sexual encounter. He soon discovered
that his first experience with sex--unprotected--had a result few
would have anticipated. He was infected with HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS.</p>
<p>Although AIDS has long struck every segment of our society,
many people feel that they are not at risk because of who they
are or where they live. AIDS is not a problem limited to
homosexuals, drug users and inner city residents, and it is not
limited to certain age groups. Many people in their 20s who
discover they are HIV positive were actually infected as
teenagers.</p>
<p>In the United States, AIDS is the second leading cause of
death among men aged 25 to 44, but the fastest growing groups of
individuals becoming infected with HIV are heterosexual women and
adolescents. AIDS is the sixth leading cause of death among
people aged 15 to 24.</p>
<p><strong>How HIV is Spread</strong></p>
<p>To protect yourself and your family, it is important to learn
the facts about how HIV is spread and how to avoid infection. HIV
is transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen and
vaginal fluid. However, there are relatively few ways to become
infected.</p>
<p><strong>Sexual Contact</strong></p>
<p>The most frequent transmission of HIV is through sexual
contact, when HIV can enter through cuts or sores. These cuts may
be so small that you are not even aware of them. Because it often
takes 10 years for an infected person to become sick, many don't
show any symptoms, and may not even know they are infected. If
you have sex with such a person, you can get the virus from them
without even knowing it.</p>
<p>The only sure way to avoid infection from sexual contact is to
abstain from sex, or to have sexual contact with only one person
who is not infected and who only has sex with you. Latex condoms
help prevent HIV infection and other diseases when they are used
properly and consistently, but they are not foolproof.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing Needles</strong></p>
<p>Sharing needles or syringes is a high-risk factor for HIV
infection. Sharing needles to inject IV drugs is the most
dangerous behavior, but the virus can also be transmitted through
needles used to inject steroids and those used for tattooing and
ear piercing. If you plan to get a tattoo or have your ears
pierced, be sure to go to a qualified person who uses unused or
sterile equipment. Ask the person to explain their safety
measures.</p>
<p><strong>Pregnancy</strong></p>
<p>A pregnant woman who is infected with HIV can pass the virus
to her child during pregnancy, childbirth or breast feeding. If
you are planning to become pregnant, and you think your current
or past activities may have put you at risk for AIDS, you should
get tested before you become pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Transfusions</strong></p>
<p>The risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion in the
United States is extremely small. Since 1985, blood donors have
been screened for risky behavior, and all donated blood is
tested. It is not possible to get HIV by giving blood, since
donation equipment is used only once and then destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Teaching Children</strong></p>
<p>Because teenagers are at risk for AIDS, it is important for
parents to educate them about the risks of using drugs and
becoming sexually active. Many teens think that young people
don't get AIDS, and that belief puts them at greater risk. If you
are a parent, talk to your children. If you need help, advice or
information, call the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) AIDS
hotline at the number listed below. They will provide information
for addressing children of any age. Ask for their &quot;AIDS
Prevention Guide.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate Your Risk</strong></p>
<p>Certain behaviors put you at greater risk for HIV infection.
Evaluate your risk and seek further information from the CDC or
local AIDS organizations.</p>
<p>The AIDS virus has been in the United States since at least
1978. If any of the following have applied to you since then, you
may be at increased risk of infection:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shared needles or syringes to inject drugs or steroids.</li>
    <li>If you are a male, had sex with other males.</li>
    <li>Had sex with someone who you believe may have been
        infected with HIV.</li>
    <li>Had a sexually transmitted disease (STD).</li>
    <li>Received a blood transfusion or blood products between
        1978 and 1985.</li>
    <li>Had sex with someone who would answer yes to any of the
        above questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these statements apply to you, you should discuss
your need for testing with a trained counselor. You should also
seek testing and counseling if you have had sex with someone and
you didn't know their risk behavior, or if you have had many
sexual partners in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Even though symptoms of AIDS usually don't appear for years, a
test can reveal HIV infection within six months of infection or
sooner. Although there is no cure for AIDS, much research is
being done, and new treatments help HIV-infected people to live
healthier and longer. If you are infected, early detection can
help you begin medical treatments that will slow the progress of
the disease.</p>
<p><strong>Seek More Information</strong></p>
<p>To ask any questions about AIDS, call the Centers for Disease
Control National AIDS Hotline at 1-800-342-AIDS; TDD,
1-800-AIDS-TTY; Spanish, 1-800-344-SIDA.</p>
<p>In addition to confidentially answering any question related
to HIV infection and AIDS, the hotline's information specialists
can send you written materials, and refer you to organizations
and facilities in your area where you can get information,
counseling and testing. </p>

<p><strong><u>Safety and Health</u></strong></p>
<h3>Indoor Air Pollution</h3>
<p>In recent studies, the <a href="http://www.epa.gov">Environmental
Protection Agency </a>has concluded that indoor air pollution is
one of the top five environmental health risks to the public.
Furthermore, the EPA estimates that indoor air pollution is
costing society billions of dollars each year in the form of
medical costs, lost productivity due to absences, lost worker
efficiency, and damage to equipment and machinery.</p>
<p>Poor indoor air quality can be a serious health threat. Postal
workers are at risk from many problems associated with indoor air
pollution due to the excessive amounts of dust, heavy machinery,
an assortment of chemicals and other factors. These conditions,
combined with management's desire to control utility costs by
limiting the use of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
systems (HVAC), can cause short- and long-term health effects.</p>
<p><strong>Health Effects</strong></p>
<p>Complaints of symptoms of certain diseases such as asthma,
Legionnaire's disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and allergic
dermatitis often can be attributed to a specific indoor air
pollutant or contaminant. When the causative agent of a
diagnosable illness is identified, it is referred to as a
building-related illness. Radon, asbestos, environmental
(second-hand) tobacco smoke, molds and viruses are often the
culprits of building-related illnesses.</p>
<p>More often, however, many symptoms cannot be identified with a
particular disease. Complaints of headaches, eye, nose and throat
irritation, nausea, fatigue, irritability, sneezing and coughing
are more difficult to pinpoint to a specific cause or a single
pollutant. These types of complaints are often linked to sick or
tight building syndrome (SBS).</p>
<p><strong>Sick Building Syndrome</strong></p>
<p>The phenomenon of sick building syndrome emerged as a result
of the energy crisis of the 1970s. In an effort to save money by
reducing energy costs, engineers, architects and building owners
designed sealed, air-tight buildings that were dependent upon
mechanical ventilation systems to maximize energy efficiency and
control indoor environmental conditions. The effect on workers'
health still requires further research and examination.</p>
<p>Factors contributing to sick building syndrome are numerous
and are usually a combination of several sources. These factors
range from inadequate ventilation, indoor pollutants, outside
sources and biological contaminants (bacteria, mold and pollen).
Other factors affecting indoor air quality include the number of
building occupants, the type of work performed, and activities
that produce dust, emissions or odors.</p>
<p><strong>Control Measures</strong></p>
<p>When the source of contaminated or poor air quality is
targeted, corrective action can include employing industrial
hygiene control methods to remedy the building-related illness.
For sick building syndrome, the problems are often more difficult
to identify and may take thorough investigation to resolve.</p>

<p><strong><u>Safety and Health</u></strong></p>
<h3>Is Asbestos a Problem in Your Facility?</h3>
<p>In 1988, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated
that 700,000 public and commercial buildings contain friable
(easily crumbled) &quot;asbestos-containing materials&quot;
(ACMs). Furthermore, over two-thirds of these buildings are
suspected to contain damaged asbestos. What is the likelihood
that your facility contains asbestos that could cause
irreversible damage to your health?</p>
<p>With active local union involvement, asbestos does not have to
be a problem in your facility.</p>
<p><strong>Where It Is; What It Does</strong></p>
<p>Asbestos is the name given to six different naturally
occurring fibrous minerals that are used in building construction
for many purposes. The most common forms of asbestos used in
building materials are chrysotile, amosite, and crocidolite. ACMs
are usually found in pipe insulation, sprayed-on fireproofing and
sound-insulating materials, floor and ceiling tiles and boiler
rooms. ACMs are generally located in areas that are not
accessible to the general public, but maintenance and custodial
workers are most likely to come into contact with ACMs and are
often subject to exposure.</p>
<p>When disturbed and released into the air, asbestos fibers may
be inhaled into the lungs where they remain forever. The level of
exposure to asbestos affects the risk of developing a respiratory
disease. Although exposure to higher levels of asbestos may
result in early development of an asbestos-related disease, most
symptoms do not begin to appear until 10 to 40 years after
exposure. Three diseases have been linked to asbestos exposure:
lung cancer, mesothelioma (lung cancer caused by asbestos), and
asbestosis (scarring of the lung tissue).</p>
<p><strong>Defining the Risks</strong></p>
<p>Asbestos becomes problematic when it is disturbed, has
deteriorated, or has been damaged. If ACM remains intact and
undisturbed, it bears no health risk to building occupants. ACM
must be properly maintained and managed to prevent accidental or
intentional disturbance. In fact, the postal facility manager is
required to establish an Operations &amp; Maintenance (O&amp;M)
program to identify and control ACMs. The O&amp;M is mandated in
a Management Instruction, &quot;Asbestos-Containing Building
Materials Control Program.&quot;</p>
<p>O&amp;M plans are recommended by the EPA to ensure that ACMs
are maintained in good condition, cleaned up properly when
released, prevented from further release, and monitored for
condition.</p>
<p>The O&amp;M plan requires that all postal-owned and -leased
facility managers comply with the following program elements:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Inspection</em> to identify and assess all ACMs.</li>
    <li><em>Management </em>and frequent monitoring of ACMs.</li>
    <li><em>Abatement </em>of sprayed-on fireproofing and
        sound-insulating materials.</li>
    <li><em>Enforcement</em> of work practices that prevent the
        release of ACMs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What Locals Can Do</strong></p>
<p>To prevent asbestos from becoming a serious health hazard,
locals should determine the location and condition of ACMs in the
facilities they represent by requesting from management a copy of
each facility's Operation &amp; Maintenance Plan and Management
Instruction, MI EL-810-94-3.</p>
<p>Also, the <a href="http://www.epa.gov">EPA</a> publishes an
informative guide to controlling asbestos entitled,
&quot;Managing Asbestos in Place: A Building Owner's Guide to
Operations and Maintenance Programs for Asbestos-Containing
Materials.&quot; This reference document can be obtained by
calling the EPA's Toxic Substances Hotline at 202-554-1404; TDD
202-554-0551. Individual APWU members should contact their locals
for more information.</p>

<p><strong><u>Safety and Health</u></strong></p>
<h3>Understaffing Causes Backlash</h3>
<p>Are you suffering from fatigue? Do you feel stressed? Are more
accidents occuring than usual? Have you had a hazardous materials
spill or incident? Are you working more overtime than usual? Do
you need more help to do your job? Is your facility or office
understaffed?</p>
<p>Postal Service restructuring and downsizing may have serious
implications on the safety and health of all postal workers. As
of October 1992, some 33,000 bargaining unit employees had taken
advantage of the USPS' early-out/optional retirement program.</p>
<p>This greatly reduced workforce can result in understaffing in
a particular area of a facility. When there are not enough people
to do the required work, workers are forced to rush and to
practice unsafe procedures, such as improper lifting techniques,
in order to make up for the decrease in staff. Consequently,
understaffing is one of the chief causes of accidents and adverse
health effects.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Hazards</strong></p>
<p>Understaffing that causes an increased workload or work pace
may impact the number and severity of workplace injuries. For
instance, since workers may be required to lift bags of mail or
push heavy carts without the assistance of a coworker, back
injuries may be more prevalent. Due to a reduction in the number
of sweepers, workers may be apt to perform improper lifting and
bending techniques in order to keep up with machine-paced work.
An increase in machine-paced work may put clerks at further risk
of developing repetitive motion injuries, such as carpal tunnel
syndrome and tendinitis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, time constraints may prevent a worker from taking
the necessary steps to prevent injury. For example, maintenance
crews may be particularly susceptible to time pressures and
forego safety precautions, such as employing machine guard and
lockout procedures before repairing machinery or wearing
appropriate personal protective equipment. In addition, a limited
custodial staff can lead to potential housekeeping hazards such
as blocked aisles, slippery walkways and littered floor areas.
Ultimately, the safety of workers may be jeopardized when fewer
employees are able to carefully label, handle and sort mail
containing hazardous materials. All workers should ensure that
they are provided the required training for handling both
hazardous materials and biological hazards.</p>
<p><strong>Health Hazards</strong></p>
<p>The health effects associated with understaffing are less
evident than the safety hazards. Understaffing that generates
increased workloads and work speedups, combined with a lack of
job control, may increase the risk of stress-related diseases. It
has been well documented that understaffing exacerbates the
effects of stress-related illnesses, such as heart disease, high
blood pressure, digestive disorders, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Repercussions?</strong></p>
<p>It may require more time to perform a job safely; but do not
forego safety for the sake of productivity. Ask for assistance
when you need to perform onerous tasks. When performing a job,
exercise safety precautions and proper procedures. If a hazardous
situation develops in your workplace, contact your safety and
health representative or APWU steward or other officer. Your
local union will bring the hazardous condition to the attention
of the Joint Local Safety Committee or OSHA (Occupational Safety
and Health Administration).</p>
<p>A decrease in staff size should be accompanied by an
appropriate reduction in workload. As the Postal Service's safety
philosophy prescribes (ELM, Chapter 8), &quot;It is good business
from the standpoint of both efficiency and economy to prevent
personal injuries on and off the job. In addition to humanitarian
considerations, injuries cost money and reduce efficiency.&quot;</p>
<p>In the long term, the effects of understaffing may prove to be
more costly in productivity, as well as in injuries, to the
Postal Service. Although the USPS warrants conditions that may
jeopardize the health and safety of its employees, workers must
always consider safety first, as it is a precondition of all work
activity.</p>

<h3>Are You at Risk?</h3>
<p>Alert! All postal workers should be aware of the threat of
occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Bloodborne
pathogens are disease-causing agents found in the blood that
include HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and HBV, the virus that
causes Hepatitis B, a serious liver disease.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is responsible for taking measures to
protect workers from the risk of occupational exposure to
biological hazards, since mail containing these biological
hazards or other infectious materials is shipped through the USPS
every day. Often, it is impossible to tell if a package accepted
for shipment by the Postal Service contains hazardous materials.
Clerks are particularly susceptible to stabs and punctures by
hypodermic needles and other medical &quot;sharps&quot; contained
in unmarked and improperly packaged shipments. In addition,
employees risk exposure from spills of packages containing blood
samples, medical wastes and other biological specimens. Those who
work in facilities near medical waste disposal companies or
hospitals are subject to further risk of exposure because of the
large mail volume to and from the centers.</p>
<p><strong>A New Standard</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to reduce or eliminate exposure to bloodborne
diseases, the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) introduced a new standard titled
Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens. The standard
became effective March 6, 1992, and all requirements should have
been operational by July 6, 1992. This standard aims to protect
over 5.6 million workers against exposure to bloodborne
pathogens.</p>
<p>Since the APWU National Agreement requires compliance with all
OSHA standards, the Postal Service issued a managment
instruction, &quot;Bloodborne Disease Exposure Control
Plans,&quot; to provide compliance and policy guidelines for all
postal facilities. The standard as outlined in the management
instruction requires local management to identify exposed and
potentially exposed personnel and to establish an exposure
control plan.</p>
<p><strong>Exposure Control Plan</strong></p>
<p>Each field division facility, managment sectional center, bulk
mail center and office must develop and maintain a plan that
identifies each job and job-task which may expose workers to
biological materials, as well as determine how to minimize or
eliminate these exposures.</p>
<p>The standard also requires that the Postal Service:</p>
<ul>
    <li>follow &quot;univerisal precautions&quot;: treat all
        biological materials as if they are contaminated and
        potentially infectious;</li>
    <li>provide personal protective equipment, such as gloves,
        aprons, face shields and goggles to workers who handle or
        frequently come into contact with biological materials;</li>
    <li>implement engineering controls to minimize risk of
        exposure, including hand-washing facilities, and follow
        proper packaging procedures (see Postal Bulletin 21820,
        7-23-92, pp. 8-10, &quot;Mailability of Sharps and Other
        Used Medical Devices&quot;);</li>
    <li>provide training every year to all employees who may be
        potentially exposed to infectious material. The training
        must be provided by a person &quot;knowledgeable in the
        subject matter,&quot; such as a physician, nurse or
        safety and health specialist. The OSHA standard and
        management instruction specifies the content of the
        training. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When an Incident Occurs</strong></p>
<p>Both an incident report (Form 1770) and an investigation
report (Form 1769) must be completed if an injury or exposure
involving biological materials occurs. The exposed worker must be
provided with first-aid, medical testing (results kept
confidential), counseling and post-exposure treatment that
includes a Hepatitis B vaccination. These procedures must be
included in the Exposure Control Plan. </p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do?</strong></p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>request from managment a copy of your facility's Exposure
        Control Plan, Management Instruction EL-810-92-4, and
        OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1030 to verify that the plan
        meets the standard's requirements;</li>
    <li>ensure that the Postal Service provide you with the
        required training if you are potentially exposed to
        biological materials;</li>
    <li>contact your local union for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to eliminating or minimizing the risk of exposure to
biological hazardous materials is to take action before an
incident occurs by enforcing the OSHA standard and USPS policy.</p>

<h3>Do You Handle Hazardous Materials Safely?</h3>
<p>Are you cautious in your acceptance and handling of hazardous
materials? Do you know what a &quot;Tag 44&quot; is? What should
you do in case of a leak or spill?</p>
<p>All clerks should know the answers to these questions for
their own and their coworkers' protection. All workers are
referred to several postal publications that deal with hazardous
materials--from acceptance to handling, and from tagging to
cleaning up spills.</p>
<p>Article 14, Section D of the National Agreement requires that
the USPS have a safety program for employees who handle hazardous
materials. Hazardous materials are described in Part 124.3 of the
Domestic Mail Manual, and include all clinical specimens and
biological products that are properly mailable (DMM 124.38).</p>
<p>A management instruction entitled &quot;Bloodborne Disease
Exposure Control Plans,&quot; issued 5/1/92, details what
management should be doing now--identifying employees who may be
exposed to bloodborne contaminants. Window clerks, pouch rack
clerks, clerks who handle small parcels, rolls or regular
parcels--or any clerk concerned that they may be in contact with
mail of this nature--should check to see if management has
identified them for special training. If not, they should request
this training.</p>
<p>Another management instruction, entitled &quot;Responses to
Hazardous Materials Releases&quot; EL-810-96-1, requires that
&quot;every employee who is involved in <em>handling</em> or
accepting hazardous materials&quot; must have Handbook EL
812-Hazardous Materials available. This instruction also requires
that <em>all</em> potentially affected employees must be given
PEDC Course #21511-00, Hazardous Materials Acceptance and
Handling. Ask for this training. Don't take chances with your
health.</p>
<p><strong>Tag 44, Form 1767</strong></p>
<p>Publication 52--Part 227, Tag 44 for Hazardous Matter, states:</p>
<p>&quot;Any sack or other consolidation device containing
hazardous matter must have a Tag 44, Sack Contents Warning,
attached. Remove Tag 44 when the hazardous matter is no longer in
the sack or consolidation device.&quot;</p>
<p>A window clerk who accepts any hazardous material must place a
Tag 44 on the consolidation device to let opening unit employees
or the next employee handling the sack, tub or other container
know that a hazardous material is enclosed. Publication 52 also
states, &quot;handle all packages carefully. Do not throw, drop
or slide packages.&quot; Carriers who collect mail from boxes
which contain hazardous material, such as medical centers, should
also receive training and tag sacks. If this is not being done,
file a Form 1767 &quot;Report of Hazard, Unsafe Condition or
Practice.&quot;</p>
<p>Opening unit employees, clerks and mail handlers should also
receive training in handling pre-identified hazardous
packages/letters and identifying other hazardous packages
carefully. When the mail is placed into the next container, that
container should be properly tagged. Pouch rate clerks who
receive a container labeled with a Tag 44 then will know to watch
for the hazardous material; they should also place a Tag 44 on
the dispatch container. This procedure is mandatory.</p>
<p><strong>Leaks or Spills</strong></p>
<p>If a spill or leak occurs, only properly trained individuals,
using proper ventilation and protective equipment, should touch
the mail (EL 801, Supervisors Safety Handbook, Appendix A pages
13-14; Management Instruction EL-810-96-1, Responses to Hazardous
Materials Releases.</p>
