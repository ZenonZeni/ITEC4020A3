Examining Mutual Fund Winners </H2><P>
<HR>

Everyone loves a winner, especially if you are invested in one. How does a mutual fund become a "winner"--one that beats its peers relatively consistently?<p>


A recent analysis of the characteristics of funds that were in the top 25% of their investment objective for each of the last year, three years, and five years turned up some noteworthy results.<p>


In examining the characteristics of these funds, one item in particular appeared to help these winners do well beating their peers over recent and extended periods. For the most part, it was good management, many times coupled with risk that is well above average for the objective category--not just in terms of greater volatility of return, but often in terms of special risks.<p>


What are the implications for investors who are examining funds with above-average performance? No fund can be above-average without being unusual--it is difficult to best the competition unless you don't quite act like everyone else. It takes more than a talented portfolio manager--it takes aggressive investing, no matter what the category, or it takes an unusual approach that simply works.<p>


Therefore, when you are examining mutual fund performance figures as part of your search, it is important to understand how a fund achieved its above-average performance before making any final decision.<p>


Check into the character of the fund investments--for instance, if it is a sector fund or emphasizes small capitalization stocks, and if it invests overseas. Flexibility in seeking domestic or foreign investment has value, but it also makes funds more difficult to understand and to integrate into an individual investor's overall portfolio without redundancies in the international portion of the portfolio.<p>


What other mutual fund characteristics are worth noting?<p>


One is the expense ratio. While the expense ratio is already reflected in the total return figures, an extremely high or low expense ratio compared to the category is worth noting. Expense ratios will usually have a relatively small impact on performance in the aggressive growth category, but they may be significant in other lower return, more homogeneous areas, such as the bond categories.<p>


Another characteristic worth noting is the portfolio turnover. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how actively the fund manager transacts the portfolio's securities. A typical aggressive growth portfolio has over 100% of its assets, by value, traded during the year. Higher portfolio turnovers translate to increased transaction costs and lower returns. Transaction costs are not included in the expense ratio.<p>


Because of the low transaction costs in the bond area and the emphasis on income, very high portfolio turnovers are not unusual and hold less serious cost implications than those of stock funds.<p>


A high performing but high tax exposure fund could be sheltered if it is held in a tax-deferred retirement account. Two tax statistics that prove revealing are the average income and capital gains distributions that a fund makes.<p>


Given the emphasis on growth in the aggressive growth category, income distributions are virtually nonexistent in funds with above-average performance. Capital gains distributions, on the other hand, are usually real and large. In the bond categories, particularly the corporate high-yield bond category, this experience is reversed, with high income distribution and low capital gains.<p>


A related tax statistic is the percentage of the portfolio that represents unrealized capital gains. While it is unlikely that these unrealized gains would all be realized in the short term, the higher the percentage, the higher the risk of large distributions. Portfolio managers change on occasion, and investment styles and strategies may be reformulated, with resulting shifts in portfolio assets.<p>


The total assets of a mutual fund can be significant for two reasons. First, a larger asset base usually translates into lower expenses. Second, for funds such as those in the aggressive growth category that have a small-capitalization stock bias, size may be a hindrance. Moving large blocks of money around in the small-cap area is difficult and reduces flexibility. The total assets of the top-performing funds in the aggressive growth category are all well below the category average.<p>


The number of different securities held gives some indication of whether or not a fund is broadly diversified. Sector funds usually invest in less than 100 securities. Given that they are concentrated by industry, the number of securities that would meet their investment objective is limited. A fund, usually a sector fund, can be classified as non-diversified, which allows 50% of the portfolio assets to be concentrated in the securities of one issuer.<p>


Funds with 250 or more securities are generally well-diversified and usually have high total assets. The U.S. government bond market is large and liquid, and therefore large government bond funds do not suffer from these kinds of problems; the size of a bond fund can be a problem, though, if it is so small it is saddled with a high expense ratio.<p>


Finally, special risks are always worth noting, but difficult to weigh. A reading of the prospectus and the statement of additional information (available from the fund upon request) will mention these special risks, but may not be as informative as you would like. The ability to borrow, use derivatives to speculate rather than hedge portfolio risks, invest in illiquid securities or invest in lower-quality debt (junk bonds) adds to potential risk. But remember, derivatives, options and futures, for example, can be used to increase or reduce risk. A fund's ability to use derivatives is not the issue; how those derivatives can be used is.<p>
