<p align="center"><b>10 Million Arrests and NIDA; Bad Science
Used to Justify Bad Policies<br>
by Richard Cowan, National Director of NORML</b></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On July 20th, NORML will mark the 10 millionth
marijuana arrest since 1965.&nbsp; While there is no way to be
certain on what date the actual 10 millionth arrest will take
place, Justice Department records indicate that it will occur
around this time.&nbsp; Our choice of this particular date was
spurred by the fact that it will be the last day of a two day
conference on marijuana sponsored by NIDA, the National Institute
on Drug Abuse. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">NIDA is supposed to be a scientific organization dedicated to
finding the truth about &quot;drug abuse&quot; and effective ways
to deal with it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, NIDA long ago became a
politicized propaganda mill dedicated to justifying the continued
arrest of marijuana users.&nbsp; This problem is well illustrated
by an article by former NIDA head (and former Drug Czar) Robert
DuPont being run on newspaper op-ed pages as &quot;The Case
Against Legalizing Drugs.&quot;&nbsp; In it, DuPont exploits two
frightening sounding factoids about marijuana use in the
Netherlands. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">First, he says that from 1984 to 1992 adolescent marijuana use
increased by 250% in the Netherlands while it decreased by two
thirds in the US during that time.&nbsp; Even if one takes the dubious
American numbers at face value (They have been criticized by the
GAO and probably greatly understate real usage rates.), these
numbers hide more than thay reveal.&nbsp; DuPont fails to say that
-- even after 20 years of having marijuana readily available --
the rate of &quot;regular&quot; use (one or more times in the
last month) by Dutch adolescents in 1992 was <u>still below the
lowest use by American adolescents in the last 20 years</u>.&nbsp;
He also fails to say that regular use by American high school
seniors soared 40% in two years to 19% in 1994.&nbsp; All this
was while American marijuana users were being arrested at the
rate of 1,000 per day.&nbsp; Moreover, from 1984 to 1992 there
were almost 3 million Americans arrested on marijuana
charges.&nbsp; This is hardly a minor cost or a sign of a
successful policy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Then he states that there has been a &quot;30% increase in
registered marijuana addicts&quot; in Holland.&nbsp; This is also
very misleading.&nbsp; The Dutch use the term &quot;addicts&quot;
very broadly to include both compulsive gamblers as well as
people who think that their marijuana use has become a
problem.&nbsp; Such persons are not registered as
&quot;addicts&quot; for any purpose other than being enrolled in
an out-patient therapy program.&nbsp; This is not the equivalent
of a methadone maintenance program. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In 1993, there were only 1,700 people enrolled in this program
out of a regular Dutch cannabis user population of approximately
650,000.&nbsp; This enrollment represents roughly one regular marijuana
user in 400.&nbsp; In the US we arrest the equivalent of one
regular marijuana user in 40 every year.&nbsp; Is that somehow a
better policy?&nbsp; Is being arrested harmless? <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">DuPont next uses these numbers out of context to project what he
says would happen if the US followed the Dutch model.&nbsp; He
claims that, &quot;The evidence from the Netherlands suggest that
if the United States were to legalize currently illicit drugs,
the numbers would probably increase from the present 12 million
to something like the 50 million who use tobacco or even the 103
million who use alcohol.&quot;&nbsp; DuPont had to dig through
and ignore all of the facts that I have cited in order to support
his predetermined conclusion.&nbsp; Why would someone do
this?&nbsp; What a bizarre view of the American people this
reflects. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">However, even the carefully selected numbers that DuPont cites
out of context do not support his conclusions.&nbsp; Indeed, why
-- after 20 years of having marijuana readily available -- hasn't
Dutch marijuana use increased to the level of tobacco or alcohol
use there?&nbsp; In any case, whatever the level of marijuana use
in the future, Dutch statistics on marijuana &quot;addicts&quot;
do not indicate that it would be a major social or public health
problem. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Dutch consider their cannabis policies successful because
they have effectively separated cannabis from hard drugs.&nbsp;
Consequently, <u>their hard drug addiction rate remained stable
and they escaped the crack cocaine epidemic</u> that began in
America during the time of the decline in marijuana use that
DuPont cites as a triumph of American policy over the
Dutch.&nbsp; 'Twas a famous victory.&nbsp; I hope that America
does not have to suffer through any more of them.</p>
