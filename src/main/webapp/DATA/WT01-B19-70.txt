I am a writer trying to put together a book containing people's bizarre, 
funny or scary stories while smoking pot...Be it a near miss with the
cops or the biggest joint you ever smoked, it doesn't matter as long 
as you share your best story from the other side...<p>

E-mail your best pot story today!<p>

<h3><A HREF="mailto:finer@terraport.net">finer@terraport.net</A></h3>

This project is being put together over the next few months and when 
it is finished all the participants will be notified as to how they can get
a copy of Pot Stories From The Net.  Your first name will only be used and
where you come from (city and country).  There will also be a map of the
world with a dot representing each pot story from around the world!<p>

Thanks again,<p>
