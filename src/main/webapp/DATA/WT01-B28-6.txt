<h2>CANNABIS </h2>

<p> </p>

<p>141.<i> Cannabis sativa </i>is an herbaceous annual plant
which readily grows untended in temperate climates in many areas
of the world, including Canada. Although there are several
varieties (i.e. indica, americana, and africana) most botanists
consider these to be members of the same species. Indian hemp, as
this plant is sometimes known, has separate male and female forms
and may grow to 10 to 12 feet under favourable conditions. </p>

<p>The first detailed description of cannabis available today
appeared in a medicinal book prepared by the Chinese Emperor Shen
Nung around 2737 B.C. Since then, cannabis has been known in the
East by such descriptions as 'the heavenly guide', 'Poor man's
heaven', 'soother of grief' and, in a more moralistic tone, 'the
liberator of sin'.223 A United Nations' report 20 years ago
estimated that 200 million people in the world used the drug for
medical, religious or recreational purposes. </p>

<p>142. What is commonly referred to as marijuana ('grass',
'pot', 'weed', 'tea', 'boo' or 'Mary Jane') in North America is
usually made up of crushed cannabis leaves, flowers, and often
twigs, and may vary considerably in potency from one sample to
another. Similar preparations are known as <i>bhang </i>and the
more potent <i>ganja </i>in India, <i>kif </i>in Morocco and <i>dagga
</i>in Africa, while the relatively pure resin is called <i>hashish
</i>('hash') in the West and much of the Middle East, and <i>charas
</i>in India. Hashish is usually prepared by pressing or scraping
the sticky amber resin from the plant, and may be more than five
times as potent on a weight basis as high quality marijuana. In
addition to these common forms, concentrated cannabis extract is
available in some countries in an alcohol solution (tincture of
Cannabis) designed for medical purposes (e.g., British
Pharmacopoeia). </p>

<p>The various forms of the drug are frequently listed under the
general term cannabis since they differ primarily in the degree
of potency. It must be stressed, however; that differences in the
preparation, quantities involved, mode of administration and
patterns of use are also important determinants of effect, and it
is often essential that these factors be identified in the
examination of individual reports. </p>

<p>143. In many societies, <i>cannabis sativa </i>has been a
highly valued crop. The trunk fibres of the woody plant are used
in the reduction of hemp rope and twine; the seeds are a source
of a product similar to linseed oil and, until recently, were
also commonly used as bird food; the pharmacological properties
of the leaves, flowers and resin have been used for thousands of
years, for both medical and non-medical purposes. </p>

<p>Cannabis was apparently brought to the Western hemisphere in
the sixteenth century by the Spaniards and was an important fibre
and seed crop centuries later in the British colonies of North
America. A portion of George Washington's Mount Vernon plantation
was dedicated to the cultivation of hemp and it was reported
that, 'Virginia awarded bounties for hemp culture and
manufacture, and imposed penalties on those who did not produce
it.'31 Although there are conflicting opinions, it would appear
that the psychotropic properties of cannabis may have been little
known to the colonial farmers at that time.12,120 Hemp was again
cultivated in North America during World War II after the major
supply lines from the East were cut off. These plants were
apparently selected for high fibre content and low
pharmacological activity. </p>

<p>144. When grown under optimal conditions almost all parts of
both male and females plants, may be potentially psychoactive.
The female has traditionally been considered the more efficient
producer of the resin responsible for the pharmacological
effects, although recent studies question this conclusion.235
Female flowers, prior to pollination, contain the greatest
concentration of resin and, consequently, the flowering tops are
highly valued and are frequently prepared separately from the
remainder of the plant. The potency is further affected by the
climate and soil conditions, certain genetic factors, and the
time and method of harvesting and preparation. </p>

<p>145. In recent years, the chemistry of cannabis has come under
careful investigation. Although numerous cannabinols were
considered potential candidates in the search for the active
principles of cannabis, it appears that certain forms of
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the most potent psychoactive
constituents. Several of these have recently been isolated and
synthesized.155 It would be incorrect to say, however, that the
active ingredient in cannabis has been established, since much
basic psychopharmacological work remains to be done in this area.
Several related synthetics (Synhexyl* or Pyrahexyl*) have also
been investigated. Although there are continual reports of THC
being sold on the illicit market, samples alleged to be THC have
invariably been found to be some other drug. </p>

<p>146. Frequent cases of cannabis use first came to the regular
attention of government and public health officials in North
America after World War I, although earlier references to such
use exist. This increase was correlated with an influx of Mexican
workers into the Southern United States, and subsequent use was
apparently largely confined to ethnic minority groups, with a
high proportion of urban-dwelling Afro- and Spanish-Americans
among the known users. In addition, cannabis use was often noted
among musicians and others in the fields of entertainment and
creative arts. In the last decade, however, the use of cannabis
has spread to quite a different segment of the population and
appears to be most prevalent among, although by no means
restricted to, middle-class youth of high school and college age.
In spite of the risk of severe penalties, estimates based on a
variety of sources suggest that eight to 20 million North
Americans have at least tried cannabis.260 These figures must be
considered tenuous however, since there is no satisfactory way to
assess their validity. </p>

<p>147. Recently the controversy surrounding this drug has
reached epidemic proportions. Usually reliable authorities have
publicly taken diametrically opposed positions regarding
cannabis, not only on moral and social policy issues, but on the
supposedly 'hard' scientific facts as well. Although the current
world literature on cannabis numbers some 2,000 publications, few
of these papers meet modern standards of scientific
investigation. They are often ill-documented and ambiguous,
emotion-laden and incredibly biased, and can, in general, be
relied upon for very little valid information. Scientific
expertise in the area of cannabis is limited by the simple fact
that there is little clearly-established scientific information
available, and preconceived notions often dominate the
interpretation of ambiguous data. The resulting confusion is
exemplified by current legislation in many parts of the world,
including Canada and the United States, which classifies cannabis
with the opiate narcotics, even though these drugs are
pharmacologically different. </p>

<p>This rather sorry state of affairs can be attributed to
several factors. To begin with, governmental restrictions on the
medical and scientific use of cannabis in North America have been
so strict over the past few decades that the majority of would-be
researchers have found it more attractive to work in other areas.
Secondly, since the widespread use of cannabis in North America
is a relatively new phenomenon, it has not, in the past, been
considered a particularly high priority research area from a
public health standpoint. In addition, until recently, there was
little possibility of standardizing the cannabis substances being
studied, since little was known about the relevant aspects of
cannabis chemistry. Consequently, there was little basis for
comparing reports, and generalizations were limited. To date, no
authorized experimental research of cannabis effects on humans is
being conducted in Canada. </p>

<p>The observations collected during centuries of relatively
unrestricted cannabis use in regions of the East have rarely been
scientifically documented because most of what we consider modern
science has been, until recently, basically a Western phenomenon.
Furthermore, profound cultural, moral and legal differences
complicate the problem of extrapolating from reports of Eastern
usage to the North American scene. </p>

<p>While there has been a concerted effort, in the following
discussions of cannabis effects, to concentrate attention on
fairly well documented topics and to avoid areas where the
evidence is especially weak, the scanty nature of our current
scientific knowledge of cannabis necessitates a cautious and
tentative approach to this interim review. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Medical
Use </h3>

<p>148. There is no currently accepted medical use of cannabis in
North America outside of an experimental context. Although
cannabis has been reported to produce an array of possibly useful
medical effects, these have either not been adequately
investigated, or can be replaced by using other more readily
available and convenient drugs. The natural product's variability
in potency and instability over time are among the factors which
have led to its disfavour in Western 20th century medicine.
However, recent advances in isolation and synthesis of certain
active principles of cannabis have prompted a second look at some
of the potentially therapeutic aspects of the drug.159 </p>

<p>Cannabis has been used in the past, is presently used in some
cultures, or is currently under clinical investigation, for its
alleged anxiety-reducing, tranquillizing, mood-elevating,
appetite stimulating, analgesic (pain reducing) and
anti-bacterial effects. It has also been used to reduce fatigue
or insomnia (sleeplessness), to ease opiate narcotic withdrawal,
and as an aid to psychotherapy in applications analogous to <i>psycholytic</i>
LSD therapy or as a clinical antidepressant. In addition,
cannabis has often been employed in the past, and is currently
used illicitly in North America, to reduce the secondary symptoms
and suffering caused by the flu and the common cold. These
various alleged therapeutic properties of cannabis have not been
adequately studied in a scientific context, and their general
medical potential remains a matter of conjecture. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Administration,
Absorption, Distribution and Physiological Fate </h3>

<p>149. Marijuana is usually smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes
known as 'joints', 'J's', 'sticks' or 'reefers', the butt of
which is often called a 'roach'. Normally one or two joints is
sufficient to produce a mild 'high', although this varies
considerably according to individual factors and the potency of
the sample. Hashish may vary in colour from very light to
dark-brown and ranges from a hard waxy substance to a crumbly,
powdery consistency. Small pieces of hashish may be placed on the
tip of a burning tobacco cigarette and the smoke inhaled off the
top. Ordinary pipes, water pipes (hookahs) and a variety of
specially made instruments are also employed in the smoking of
hashish and marijuana. </p>

<p>In the Middle East and Far East cannabis is often mixed with
such substances as <i>datura stramonium </i>(Jimson weed),
tobacco, <i>nux vomica, </i>and opium, which further complicates
the interpretation of reports from these areas.107 Samples of
cannabis obtained in Canada generally do not contain other drugs,
although they may be 'cut' with relatively inert substances.143
There have been no analytical reports to support rumours that
heroin or other opiate narcotics have been found in cannabis in
this country. </p>

<p>150. Cannabis smoke is usually inhaled deep into the lungs and
held there for an extended time, in order to increase absorption.
The onset of psychological effects is almost immediate with the
smoking of more potent forms of cannabis, and the peak effects
usually occur within the first quarter-hour following
inhalations. Major effects usually last several hours while
milder ones may endure for half a day longer. </p>

<p>Absorption by the gastro-intestinal tract is effective,
although relatively slow. Since the resin is fairly soluble in
hot water, cannabis is often used in making tea or other
beverages - mild <i>bhang </i>drinks, for example, are common in
India. In some countries hashish is incorporated into buttered
candies called <i>majoon, </i>or other foods. The effects of
cannabis taken orally usually begin after an hour or so, and
gradually reach a peak within several hours, then slowly decline.
Very high doses may produce some effects lasting more than a day,
although the drug is not ordinarily used in such large quantities
in North America. The effects of oral administration are often
noticeably different from those of inhalation. It is uncertain
whether this is due to chemical changes from the heat in the
smoked material, effects of the digestive juices or other
metabolic enzymes after oral administration, or differences in
rapidity and efficiency of absorption and distribution in the two
methods. On a weight basis, however, smoking seems to be the most
effective mode of administration. The speed of acquisition, the
duration of effects, and the recovery from the cannabis 'high'
depends on the rate, quantity, and mode of administration, in
addition to various psychological and physiological
characteristics of the user. </p>

<p>151. While considerable progress is being made in this area,
little is known at the present time regarding the metabolism,
excretion, and mechanism of action of cannabis. There is evidence
that some metabolites of THC are psychoactive. Techniques are
being developed which are designed to measure cannabis products
in the urine, blood and saliva, and substantial breakthroughs are
expected in these areas in the near future. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Effects
of Cannabis </h3>

<p>152. Although the literature is brimming with impressionistic
reports of the effects of cannabis, only a small number of these
meet even the most rudimentary scientific standards. A review of
those effects which have been unequivocally established and
scientifically documented would be a scant summary indeed. In
spite of strong disagreement among extremists on many points in
the cannabis controversy, major governmental reports by
independent- commissions of various backgrounds over
three-quarters of a century have come to some surprisingly
similar conclusions regarding the use of cannabis. Such reports
include the British <i>Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report
(1893-4),</i>107 Mayor La Guardia's Report on <i>The Marijuana
Problem in The City of New York </i>(1944),149 the United States
President's Commission on <i>Law Enforcement</i> <i>and
Administration of Justice: Task Force on Narcotics and Drug Abuse
</i>(1967),220 and the <i>Cannabis </i>report (1968), by the
British Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence, prepared under the
chairmanship of the Baroness Wootton of Abinger.5 </p>

<p>In many areas in which formal scientific data are not
available, we shall have to rely on expert opinion, and in such
instances reference will be made to some of the observations
presented in these aforementioned governmental reports. A general
overview of the effects of cannabis will be followed by a more
detailed examination of certain selected scientific studies.
Primary concern will be given to recent publications. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Overview
of Effects </h3>

<p>153.<i> Physiological</i> <i>Effects. </i>The short-term
physiological effects of cannabis are usually slight and
apparently have little clinical significance. The following
effects have been established in adequately controlled studies:
increase in heart rate, swelling of the minor conjunctival blood
vessels in the membranes around the eye, and minor unspecific
changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Also commonly noted,
but less well documented, are: a slight drying of the eyes and
nasal passages, initially stimulated salivation followed by
dryness of the mouth, throat irritation and coughing during
smoking, and increased urination. Less commonly, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea or constipation are reported. These
gastro-intestinal disturbances rarely occur with smoked cannabis,
although nausea is not uncommon when large quantities are taken
orally. Changes in blood sugar level and blood pressure have been
inconsistently reported. Appetite is usually stimulated. Contrary
to popular belief, there is little evidence of pupil dilation. In
some individuals, incoordination, ataxia and tremors have been
observed and chest pains, dizziness and fainting have
occasionally been noted, usually at high doses. Physiological
hangover effects have been described but are rare, even after
considerable intoxication. </p>

<p>154. Cannabis has little acute physiological toxicity - sleep
is the usual somatic consequence of over-dose. No deaths due
directly to smoking or eating of cannabis have been documented
and no reliable information exists regarding the lethal dose in
humans. One fatality, however, was reportedly caused by
distention of the bowel during a prolonged bout of gross
over-eating under the acute influence of cannabis.134 </p>

<p>155. There is little reliable information on the long-term
effects of cannabis use. There are numerous reports from Eastern
countries of chronic ill-health among very heavy long-term users
of hashish. Most commonly reported are minor respiratory and
gastro-intestinal ailments. These studies rarely provide a
control group of comparable non-users for a reference standard,
and clinical findings are usually confounded with a variety, of
social, economic and cultural factors which are not easily
untangled. Consequently, much important work remains to be done
in this area. The British <i>Cannabis </i>report (1968) states: 5
</p>

<p>Having reviewed all the material available to us, we find
ourselves in agreement with the conclusion reached by the Indian
Hemp Drugs Commission appointed by the Government of India
(1893-1894) and the New York Mayor's Committee on Marihuana
(1944), that the long-term consumption of cannabis in <i>moderate
</i>doses has no harmful effects. </p>

<p>156. Some observers have suggested that chronic smoking of
cannabis might produce carcinogenic effects similar to those now
attributed to the smoking of tobacco, although no evidence exists
to support this view at this time. A meaningful comparison is
difficult to make since the quantity of leaf consumed by the
average cigarette smoker in North America is many times the
amount of cannabis smoked by even heavy users. The present
pattern of use by regular cannabis smokers in North America is
more analogous to intermittent alcohol use (e.g., once or twice a
week), than to the picture of chronic daily use presented by
ordinary tobacco dependence. However, the deep inhalation
technique usually used with cannabis might add respiratory
complications. </p>

<p>157. Recently, there have been conflicting reports that large
quantities of cannabis extract, injected into pregnant females of
certain strains of rodents, may cause abnormalities in the
offspring.85 These disparate results can not be simply
extrapolated to humans and at this time there is no scientific
evidence that cannabis adversely affects human chromosomes or
causes deformed children. </p>

<p>158.<i> Psychological Effects</i>.<i> </i>The psychological
effects of cannabis vary greatly with a number of factors and are
often difficult to predict. The dose, type of preparation, and
rate and mode of administration can greatly influence the
response, even if the effective doses and peak responses are made
comparable. Furthermore, the psychological effects depend to a
considerable degree on the personality of the user, his past
experience with cannabis or other drugs, his attitudes, and the
setting in which the drug is used. </p>

<p>Although 'hash' may be many times more potent than marijuana,
the effects of these two forms of cannabis, as usually used in
North America, are often indistinguishable. It has been reported
that most experienced individuals smoke to attain a certain
effect or level of 'high', and adjust the dose according to the
potency of the substance used. 'Grass' and 'hash' are generally
used interchangeably and great variations in potency of different
samples are accommodated by the experienced user through a
'titration' of dose - i.e., intake is stopped when the smoker
reaches a personally comfortable level of intoxication. Such
precision is generally not possible with oral use, however, due
to the long delay in action, and a 'non-optimal' effect is
therefore much more likely to occur with this practice. In some
Eastern countries, different social norms have evolved around the
different forms of cannabis, and the pattern of drug use
associated with bhang drinks may be quite different from that
seen in regular hashish users. Long-term heavy cannabis users
invariably prefer the more potent ganja or hashish.45, 107 </p>

<p>It is often difficult to find descriptions of the
psychological affects of marijuana that are free from value
judgements. Many effects seem to take on good or bad connotations
depending on the circumstances in which they occur, the personal
attitudes of the individual undergoing the experience, and the
orientation of the observer who is recording them. Moreover,
since many of the significant psychological effects are intensely
personal, the laboratory scientist often has little opportunity
to make objective measurements, and must rely on subjective,
introspective reports, communicated verbally through a language
system which is frequently inadequate. </p>

<p>159. Cannabis is one of the least potent of the psychedelic
drugs, and some might object to its being classified with LSD and
similar substances. It is often suggested that marijuana is a
mild intoxicant, more like alcohol.132 There is evidence,
however, that high doses of cannabis in some individuals may
produce effects similar, in some respects, to an attenuated LSD
experience. While such effects are rarely reported, many milder
aspects of the psychedelic experience regularly occur with a
cannabis 'high'. The outline of potential reactions to
psychedelic drugs presented in the section on LSD include: <i>psychotic
and non-psychotic adverse reactions, psychodynamic, cognitive,
aesthetic, and psychedelic-peak (transcendental) or religious
experiences. </i>While analogous experiences may occur in varying
degrees with cannabis, the quality of the effects is reportedly
different, the intensity considerably lower, and the overall
response more controllable than with the more powerful
psychedelic drugs. It would be incorrect to say that cannabis in
moderate dose actually produces a mild LSD experience; the
effects of these two drugs are physiologically, behaviourally and
subjectively quite distinct. Furthermore, since no
cross-tolerance occurs between LSD and THC the mechanism of
action of these two drugs is thought to be different.109 </p>

<p>160. A cannabis 'high' typically involves several phases. The
initial effects are often somewhat stimulating and, in some
individuals, may elicit mild tension or anxiety which usually is
replaced by a pleasant feeling of well-being. The later effects
usually tend to make the user introspective and tranquil. Rapid
mood changes often occur. A period of enormous hilarity may be
followed by a contemplative silence. </p>

<p>Psychological, effects which are typically reported by users
include: happiness, increased conviviality, a feeling of enhanced
interpersonal rapport and communication, heightened sensitivity
to humour, free play of the imagination, unusual cognitive and
ideational associations, a sense of extra-ordinary reality, a
tendency to notice aspects of the environment of which one is
normally unaware, enhanced visual imagery, an altered sense of
time in which minutes may seem like hours, changes in visually
perceived spatial relations, enrichment of sensory experiences
(subjective aspects of sound and taste perception are often
particularly enhanced), increased personal understanding and
religious insight, mild excitement and energy, (or just the
opposite), increased or decreased behavioural activity, increased
or decreased verbal fluency and talkativeness, lessening of
inhibitions, and at higher doses, a tendency to lose or digress
from one's train of thought. Feelings of enhanced spontaneity and
creativity are, often described, although an actual increase in
creativity is difficult to establish scientifically. While most
experts agree that cannabis has little specific aphrodisiac (sex
stimulating) effect, many users report increased enjoyment of sex
and other intimate human contact while under the influence of the
drug.93,161 </p>

<p>Less pleasant, experiences may occur in different individuals,
or possibly in the same individuals at different times. Some of
these reactions may include: fear and anxiety, depression,
irritability, nausea, headache, backache, dizziness, a dulling of
attention, confusion, lethargy, and a sensation of heaviness,
weakness and drowsiness. Disorientation, delusions,
suspiciousness and paranoia, and in some cases, panic, loss of
control, and acute psychotic states have been reported.
Schwarz196 has compiled an extensive catalogue of reports of
adverse symptoms which have been attributed to cannabis in the
world literature. </p>

<p>161. The possibility of psychiatric disorders associated with
cannabis use has received considerable attention. Although there
are some well documented examples of very intense and nightmarish
short-term reactions (usually among inexperienced users in
unpleasant situations and with high doses), these cases seem to
be relatively rare and generally show a rapid recovery. Although
many regular users have had an experience with cannabis which was
in some way unpleasant, 'freak-outs' are apparently rare.
Ungerleider230 has reported 1,887 'adverse reactions' to
marijuana in the Los Angeles area. These data are difficult to
interpret since no clear definition of adverse reaction is
provided and no follow-ups were made. By contrast, Unwin in
Montreal reports:233 </p>

<p>I have seen only three adverse reactions in the past two
years; all following the smoking of large amounts of hashish and
all occurring in individuals with a previous history of
psychiatric treatment for psychiatric or borderline conditions. </p>

<p>The few cases of prolonged psychosis which have been reported
have usually been attributed to an earlier personality
predisposition, although this hypothesis is not always easy to
substantiate. Earlier notions of a specific 'cannabis psychosis'
have generally been abandoned since there is little evidence of
such a distinct psychiatric entity. Smith206 in San Francisco,
reports that he has never observed 'cannabis psychosis' in over
35,000 marijuana users seen at the Haight-Ashbury clinic. But a
recent psychiatric report described several psychotic reactions
occurring in American soldiers in Vietnam, who had used
cannabis.218 The psychiatrist believed that the psychotic
episodes may have been related to cannabis use. This emphasizes
the need for caution before any generalizations about the
evidence of psychiatric complication with cannabis use are made -
particularly in individuals who have consumed large doses of
potent material under conditions of increased physical and
psychological stress. Such general conditions are, of course, by
no means restricted to military operations. </p>

<p>162. There have been a few reports of 'flash-backs' or
spontaneous recurrences of certain cannabis effects some time
after the last use of the drug, although such events are
apparently quite rare. In addition, cannabis has also been
reported to have precipitated LSD recurrences in some heavy users
of LSD.123 </p>

<p>Only a few adequate laboratory investigations have been made
of the effects of cannabis on normal psychological functioning.
Most of the data indicate little change under the conditions
tested, although reports of both impaired and improved
performance have been made. Because of the perceptual, cognitive
and psycho-motor effects often attributed to cannabis, it seems
reasonable to expect that in high doses the drug would impair
automobile driving. Many regular users feel this is so and avoid
driving, while others content that they are more careful and are
probably better drivers when slightly 'high'.93 There is no
available evidence that cannabis has been a significant factor in
traffic accidents. The one study testing cannabis effects on
driving skills found little impairment to be caused by a 'mild
social high'.61 Some of the studies pertinent to these topics
will be discussed in more detail at the end of this section. </p>

<p>163. A study by Suchman217 suggests a close association
between the use of marijuana in some young people and adherence
to what is termed the 'hang-loose' ethic. Central to this notion
is the questioning of such traditional patterns of behaviour and
belief as, conventional religion, marriage, pre-marital chastity
and the accumulation of wealth. Subscribers to this ethic
apparently do not necessarily reject the <i>mores </i>of the
established order, but are strongly critical of them. In this
study, the stronger the student embraced the ethic the more
favourable he was towards marijuana use. Smoking marijuana was
highly associated with 'nonconformist' behaviour such as
participating in mass protests and was more likely to be reported
by those students who were dissatisfied with the education they
were receiving. The 'hang-loose' ethic, while it may represent
antagonism to the conventional world, does not appear to create
apathy and withdrawal. The investigator suggests that the smoking
of marijuana is part of the behaviour associated with this ethic
rather than the cause of it. </p>

<p>A somewhat different view is suggested by McGlothlin and
West154 on the basis of clinical observation. They have described
an 'amotivational syndrome' in some heavy marijuana users in
North America. It is suggested that such use of marijuana may
contribute to some characteristic personality changes including
apathy, loss of effectiveness, diminished capacity or willingness
to carry out complex long-term plans, endure frustration, follow
routines or successfully master new material. The interpretation
of these observations is complicated by the fact that such
individuals are usually involved with other drugs as well as
cannabis. </p>

<p>Several Eastern studies have suggested that chronic high-dose
use of the more potent preparations of cannabis may have
detrimental effects on the individual. One of the most
comprehensive reports was that of the Chopras in 1939.45 An
eight-year study was carried out on a sample of 1,238 cannabis
users. With regard to moderate doses, users of relatively mild
bhang reported a general feeling of well-being, relief from worry
and sharpened appetite. Heavy users were often found to suffer
from several adverse symptoms. In some instances, cannabis use
was seen as an attempt at self-medication in response to theme
disorders rather than as the cause. </p>

<p>The researchers report that among the ganja and charas users,
a small percentage suffered from serious psychiatric disorder,
and minor emotional problems, including impairment of judgement
and memory, were observed in the majority of these subjects.
According to the authors, a significant proportion of the group
had pre-existing neurotic tendencies which may have contributed
to their problem of drug use. Heavy users were often observed to
show marked inactivity, apathy and self-neglect. The majority of
those who took small doses of any of the cannabis preparations
felt that the overall consequences of their drug habit were nil
or beneficial, while the majority of those who chronically took
heavy doses, thought the practice harmful. These subjective
judgements were generally consistent with the clinical
observations reported. </p>

<p>165. This and other reports from Eastern countries are
difficult to interpret and apply to the Western situation. To
begin with, no equivalent data are presented from a comparable
control group of non-users of similar social and economic
background (although some comparisons among users are possible)
and there is no means of estimating the representativeness of the
sample studied. In addition, there are many social and economic
factors which complicate cross-cultural comparisons. The use of
cannabis has a different meaning in Eastern cultures where a long
history and tradition surrounds its use - than it does in the
West, where it is a relatively recent phenomenon. Often, concepts
of normalcy and deviancy differ considerably from one culture to
another. In addition, the Eastern cannabis user generally
consumes larger quantities of more potent forms with greater
frequency than does the Western user. </p>

<p>166. Although the possession of cannabis is a crime, and in
obtaining it an individual must normally come in contact with
other individuals committing drug offences, there is no
scientific evidence that cannabis itself is responsible for the
commission of other forms of criminal behaviour. Chopra and
Chopra45 suggest that cannabis use may, in fact, actually reduce
the occurrence of crime and aggression by decreasing general
activity. While criminals may be more likely to use cannabis than
other individuals, few crimes committed under the influence of
marijuana have been documented, and a casual relationship between
the drug use and other illegal behaviour has not been
established. It may well be that an individual who is inclined to
commit one illegal act (e.g., a drug offence), may also be more
likely than average to transgress in other areas as well. Some
observers feel that the lessening of inhibitions often reported
with cannabis use might, in certain delinquent individuals,
increase the likelihood of asocial behaviour. In a 1967
judgement, rendered by Judge G. Joseph Tauro, Chief Justice of
the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in the Boston trial of two
men (Leis and Weiss) accused of trafficking cannabis, the
following statement appears:54 </p>

<p>In my opinion, a proper inference may be drawn from the
evidence, that there is a relationship between the use of
marijuana and the incidence of crime and anti-social behaviour. </p>

<p>The brief presented to the Commission by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police dealt at considerable length with the alleged
association of illegal drug use and criminal behaviour in Canada.
This evidence is discussed later in the report. </p>

<p>The British <i>Cannabis </i>report (1968) states that:5 </p>

<p>In the United Kingdom the taking of cannabis has not so far
been regarded, even by the severest critics, as a direct cause of
serious crime.... The evidence of a link with violent crime is
far stronger with alcohol than with the smoking of cannabis. </p>

<p>167. <i>Tolerance and Dependence. </i>While gross tolerance to
the major effects of cannabis does not seem to occur in humans,
there are many more subtle aspects of this situation which have
yet to be clarified. Although there is little tendency for
intermittent users to increase dose, certain cannabis effects may
be modified by repeated experiences with the drug. Many
investigators have pointed out that in some individuals there
appears to be a 'reverse' tolerance - i.e., smaller doses may
produce the <i>desired </i>effects after the user has become
familiar with the drug. Many individuals experienced little or no
effect the first time they smoked cannabis. Whether this is due
to initially poor smoking technique, some learning or
psychological adaptation process, or perhaps some more molecular
pharmacological sensitization, is uncertain. On the other hand, a
few individuals appear to be extremely sensitive to the effects
of cannabis at the beginning and may initially report intense,
ornate, and perhaps frightening experiences which are rarely, if
ever, equalled in subsequent administrations. </p>

<p>168. Investigators have reported that regular users learn to
direct or control some of the psychological and behavioural
effects while subjectively 'high' and may be able to perform
certain functions better than non-users given the same dose. This
would suggest that some sort of differential selective adaptation
or tolerance may develop to some of the initially
'uncontrollable' effects.User4 remain sensitive to the rewarding
effects of the drug since there is generally no marked
inclination for them to increase dosage. Some users report that
if they stay 'high' for several days in a row the drug experience
loses much of its freshness and clarity and, consequently, they
prefer intermittent use. </p>

<p>There are reports of chronic, heavy users from the East who
consume what would seem to be rather large quantities by Western
standards.24,30 Whether this reflects some degree of tolerance
with heavy use in these users or differences in desired effects
or general drug-using norms, is not known. </p>

<p>169. Physical dependence to cannabis has not been demonstrated
and it would appear that there are normally no adverse<i> </i>physiological
effects or withdrawal symptoms occurring with abstinence from the
drug, even in regular users. On the other hand, there have been
several reports from the Far East and Middle East, of
irritability, mild discomfort, and certain behavioural symptoms
occurring after withdrawal of the drug in chronic heavy users.24
It must be kept in mind that these cases are not clearly
documented and that the purity of the substances involved is not
certain. Since hashish is smoked with large quantities of tobacco
and other drugs in many Eastern countries, these mixtures could
be responsible for the minor withdrawal symptoms reported. </p>

<p>170. No controlled research has been done into the effects of
discontinued cannabis administration after unusually high doses
of the unadulterated substance have been given over a prolonged
length of time. While such an extreme situation may appear to be
of little social significance, it should be noted that physical
dependence on the sedatives (alcohol, barbiturates and
tranquillizers) usually occurs in only a small minority of users
who take abnormally large quantities of the drug for extended
periods of time. </p>

<p>171. The presence or absence of psychological dependence in a
given situation, of course, depends on one's definition of the
term. While many cannabis users in North America seem to take the
drug once or twice a week, in a social context similar to that in
which alcohol is normally consumed, and readily abstain for weeks
or months with no ill effects, there is a small minority of users
who smoke it daily and whose regular routine and sense of
well-being is disrupted if they are unable to obtain the drug.
Most users apparently find the drug pleasant and desirable, and
often will go out of their way to acquire it - even at the risk
of criminal penalty. However, the craving and urgency associated
with opiate narcotic of sedative (or tobacco) dependence do not
seem to occur. There are reports from the East that considerable
psychological dependence has occurred in a minority of
individuals in whom the use of the drug has become a major
component of their existence.107 </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Cannabis
and other Drugs </h3>

<p>172. The minority of cannabis users studied in North America
have had experience with a variety of other psychoactive drugs,
alcohol and tobacco being the most frequently mentioned. As might
be expected, most of those who smoke cannabis first acquired a
regular tobacco habit. </p>

<p>A link between tobacco smoking and marijuana use has been
suggested by Rowell, who worked closely with the United States
Bureau of Narcotics in the 1930s:191 </p>

<p>Slowly, insidiously, for over three hundred years, Lady
Nicotine was setting the stage for a grand climax. The long years
of tobacco using were but an introduction and training for
marijuana use. Tobacco, which was first smoked in a pipe, then as
a cigar, and at last as a cigarette, demanded more and more of
itself until its supposed pleasures palled, and some of the
tobacco victims looked about for something stronger. Tobacco was
no longer potent enough. </p>

<p>173. The relationship between cannabis and alcohol use has
been the subject of much controversy. Many marijuana users claim
that they have drastically reduced their consumption of alcohol,
or quit it, since using cannabis. They often suggest that
cannabis may be a cure for society's alcohol ills. The
considerable hostility towards and rejection of alcohol expressed
by many cannabis-using youth, however, is clearly not reflected
in the majority of cannabis users. In general, survey studies
find that those who use alcohol are more likely than
'teetotallers' to use cannabis, and most cannabis users still use
alcohol. We have no information as to what effects, cannabis has
on an individual's drinking behaviour and overall alcohol intake.
It is not clear whether cannabis tends to replace alcohol as an
intoxicant in the user population or whether the use of these
drugs is addictive without significant interaction, or if the use
of one of these drugs potentiates the use of the other. It
appears that, if used simultaneously, the alcohol effects
dominate and many of the psychedelic aspects of cannabis are
suppressed. For this reason, many cannabis users refuse to mix
the drugs even if they may enjoy one separately. </p>

<p>The question of comparing benefits and ills of alcohol and
cannabis has become a popular and engaging endeavour. Due to the
profoundly different social connotations and patterns of use, as
well as scientific knowledge of these drugs, such a comparison
must be made on limited and tenuous grounds. </p>

<p>174. In the United States, the majority of persons studied who
had been dependent on opiate narcotics, had previous experience
with cannabis (and were usually heavy users of alcohol). In
Canada this has less often been the pattern, and it appears that
heavy use of sedatives (alcohol and barbiturates) rather than
cannabis has most frequently preceded heroin use.246,215 </p>

<p>It has been suggested that the Canadian pattern is becoming
more similar to the United States experience. </p>

<p>On this topic, the <i>United States Task Force Report </i>(1967)
concludes:220 </p>

<p>The charge that marijuana 'leads to the use of addicting
drugs' need to be critically examined. There is evidence that a
majority of the heroin users who come to the attention of public
authorities have, in fact, had some prior experience with
marijuana. But this does not mean that one leads to the other in
the sense that marijuana has an intrinsic quality that creates a
heroin liability. There are too many marijuana users who do not
graduate to heroin, and too many heroin addicts with no known
prior marijuana use, to support such a theory. Moreover there is
no scientific basis for such a theory. </p>

<p>The most reasonable hypothesis here is that some people who
are predisposed to marijuana are also predisposed to heroin use
it may also be the case, that through the use of marijuana a
person forms the personal associations that later expose him to
heroin. </p>

<p>With a similar orientation, the British <i>Cannabis </i>report
(1968) states:5 '. . . we have concluded that a risk of
progression to heroin from cannabis is not a reason for retaining
the control over this drug (cannabis).' </p>

<p>175. Many heavy users of cannabis reportedly also experiment
with a variety of other drugs, including amphetamines as well as
psychedelic substances. Again, marijuana is often the first drug
(other than alcohol and tobacco) taken by youthful multi-drug
users. The role of cannabis in the 'progression' to other drugs
has not been adequately studied and it is unclear whether it
plays a predisposing role, or is often used earlier simply
because of its wider availability and social acceptance. </p>

<p>176. While no cross-tolerance occurs between cannabis and the
other psychedelic drugs or the stimulants, considerable mention
has been made of 'multi-drug' psychological dependence in which
individuals may seem to depend on a variety of drugs in general,
rather than on any particular chemical substance. </p>

<p>177. Initiation of Cannabis Use. Cannabis users are usually
'turned on' for the first time by friends and associates who have
had previous experience with the drug. There is little evidence
of aggressive 'pushers' being responsible for the initiation of
cannabis smoking, although many individuals have reported
considerable peer-group pressure to try it. The distribution or
trafficking of cannabis is largely carried out in the same social
manners and is usually handed from friend to friend, although
there are some individuals whose motivation for trafficking is
primarily commercial. Some of the marijuana in Canada is
'home-grown' but most apparently comes from Mexico and the
southern United States. </p>

<h3><img src="../../../graphics/golddot1.gif" align="bottom">Some
Cannabis Studies of Current Significance </h3>

<p>178. I. In 1939, after consulting with the New York Academy of
Medicine, Mayor La Guardia of New York appointed a special
scientific committee to investigate the effects of marijuana,
both in the community and under laboratory conditions. The final
report entitled <i>The Marijuana Problem in the City New York:
Sociological, Medical, Psychological and Pharmacological Studies</i>149
was published in 1944, and is still one of the most widely quoted
and comprehensive studies of cannabis. </p>

<p>The report provoked considerable controversy, and although it
has been generally well received by the scientific community,
certain other individual were quite vociferous in expressing
their dismay at the committee's conclusions. O.J. Kalant120 of
the Addiction Research Foundation, has prepared a careful
critical analysis of the Mayor's report. She observed that:
'Judged from a purely scientific standpoint this study deserves
neither the extravagant praise nor the vicious attacks to which
it has been submitted.' </p>

<p>179. The field work for the sociological study was undertaken
by six specially trained police officers. The squad 'lived' in
the environment in which marijuana smoking or peddling was
suspected. They frequented poolrooms, bars and grills, dance
halls, subways, public toilets, parks and docks. On the basis of
their observations, the following conclusions were drawn: The
distribution and use was centred in Harlem. While the cost of
marijuana was low and therefore within range of most persons, the
sale and distribution was not under the control of any single
organized group. The consensus among users was that the drug
created a definite feeling of adequacy. The practice of smoking
marijuana did not lead to addiction in the medical sense of the
word, did not lead to morphine or heroin or cocaine addiction,
and no effort was made to create a market for opiate narcotics by
stimulating the practice of marijuana smoking. Marijuana was not
the determining factor in the commission of major crimes, nor was
it the cause of juvenile delinquency. Finally, 'the publicity
concerning the catastrophic effects of marijuana smoking in New
York City is unfounded.' </p>

<p>180. The clinical studies were conducted with an experimental
group of 77 persons - 72 of whom were inmates of various New York
Prisons. Forty-eight of these subjects had used marijuana
previously and some had been heavy users of opiate narcotics.
Both orally ingested cannabis concentrate and ordinary marijuana
cigarettes were administered in various quantities. </p>

<p>A feeling of euphoria, occasionally interrupted by unpleasant
sensations, was the usual response to cannabis. Also noted were
other common aspects of a marijuana 'high', such as laughter and
relaxation. No signs of aggression occurred, although some
indications of anti-social feelings were expressed. Dizziness, a
light floating sensation, dryness of the throat, thirst, an
increase in appetite (particularly for sweets), unsteadiness and
a feeling of heaviness of the extremities, were among the common
somatic symptoms noted. Nausea and vomiting occasionally occurred
with oral ingestion. Most effects seemed to increase with dose
and were often more pronounced on those who had not previously
used cannabis. </p>

<p>181. There were 9 cases of psychotic reaction in the prisoners
studied. In 6 instances, acute or short-term adverse reactions
characterized by '... mental confusion and excitement of
delirious nature with periods of laughter and anxiety' occurred.
Three cases of 'true' psychosis appeared to be associated with
the experiment. 'The precise role marijuana in the psychotic
states of the three unstable persons is not clear.' In the first
subject 'the psychotic episode was probably related to epilepsy.'
In the case of the second and third subjects, the fact that they
were sent back to prison to complete their sentences must be
considered an important, if not the main factor in bringing on
the psychosis.' None of the nine individuals had been a regular
user of cannabis. The researchers pointed out, however, that
marijuana can bring on a true psychotic state under certain
circumstances in predisposed individuals. </p>

<p>182. The most consistent physiological effects reported were:
a temporary increase in heart rate, an inconsistent increase in
blood pressure, and increase in frequency of urination, dilated
pupils, and a moderate increase in blood sugar level and basal
metabolism. Other organic and systematic functions were
unchanged. It should be pointed out that the tests reported were
not conducted under controlled double-blind conditions, and some
of these findings have not been confirmed in later controlled
studies. </p>

<p>183. Simple psychomotor functions were only affected slightly
by large doses, and negligibly or not at all by small doses of
marijuana. More complex functions, hand steadiness, static
equilibrium, and complex reaction time were impaired by both dose
levels. Generally, non-users were more affected by the marijuana
than those with previous marijuana experience. Strength of grip,
speed of tapping, auditory acuity, 'musical ability' and
estimation of short time intervals and linear distances were
unchanged. Placebos were not generally used in this section and
the details of the statistical analysis were not presented. </p>

<p>184. In the section on Intellectual Functioning, a variety of
psychological tests designed to measure aspects of intelligence,
learning, memory and performance were administered. Two doses of
oral concentrate were used in most instances. The author
concludes that marijuana ingestion ... has a transitory ,adverse
effect on mental functioning', with the greatest impairment at
high dose on tasks involving complex functions. No statistical
analysis was done to distinguish drug effects from statistical
analysis was done to distinguish drug effects from random
variation, however, and again, no controlled double-blind design
was used. Furthermore, the author's conclusions are not always
consistent with the evidence which, for example, suggests some
improvement in verbal abilities and certain other functions after
marijuana ingestion. These data are not discussed. The author
notes that 'indulgence in marijuana does not appear to result in
mental deterioration'. </p>

<p>Kalant has noted with respect to this section: 120 </p>

<p>In summary, the results seem to bear out the conclusion that
big enough doses of marijuana impair variety of mental functions,
while small doses may improve some of them. These conclusions are
only tentative, because the author presents no statistical
treatment of the data. </p>

<p>185. The 'Emotional and General Personality Structure' of
varying numbers of users and non-users were studied before and
after several doses of cannabis. The effects of low dose were
generally pleasant and favourably received by the subjects, while
the high dose seemed more likely to produce anxiety, distress,
and a sense of insecurity. The committee concluded: </p>

<p>Under the influence of marijuana the basic personality
structure of the individual does not change, but some of the more
superficial aspects of his behaviour show alteration. The new
feeling of self confidence induced by the drug expresses itself
primarily through oral rather than through physical activity.
There is some indication of a diminution in physical activity.
The disinhibition which results from the use of marijuana
releases what is latent in the individual's thoughts and
emotions, but does not evoke responses which would be totally
alien to him in his undrugged state. </p>

<p>186. A comparison between users and non-users as regards the
possibility of physical and mental deterioration as a consequence
of marijuana use was made on 48 users, some of whom had been
smoking regularly for two to seventeen years. The investigators
concluded that: </p>

<p>There is definite evidence in this study that the marijuana
users were not inferior in intelligence to the general population
and that they had suffered no mental or physical deterioration as
a result of their use of the drug. </p>

<p>187. The therapeutic use of cannabis in the treatment of
opiate narcotic addicts was explored in 56 patients. Tentative
conclusions suggest improved appetite and mood, less severe
symptoms and a generally improved clinical picture during
withdrawal. Again no control group was studied. </p>

<p>The Committee reported: </p>

<p>From the study as a whole, it is concluded that marijuana is
not a drug of addiction, comparable to morphine, and that if
tolerance is acquired, this is of a very limited degree.... The
habit depends on the pleasurable effects that the drug produces. </p>

<p>These views were based largely on interviews with hundreds of
users, the sociological studies and the laboratory
investigations. Some observers have pointed out that these
conclusions may not apply to the conditions of heavy chronic use
sometimes reported in Eastern countries. </p>

<p>188. Some individuals have criticized the research for often
using high doses of little social relevance - the authors admit
that users, if left to their own devices, tend to approximate the
lower doses used in the experiment. Other investigators feel that
more chronic users of higher doses should have been studied for
the investigation of long-term effects including tolerance and
dependence. </p>

<p>189. In summary, although the La Guardia report remains one of
the more significant contributions to the cannabis literature,
the conclusions must be qualified in accordance with the numerous
weaknesses in the experimental methodology: blind and placebo
controls were absent and statistical analyses often lacking,
reporting was occasionally biased when the data were ambiguous,
sample selection may not have been adequate for certain
conclusions in the sociological study, and the almost complete
use of prison inmates as subjects in the clinical studies and
hospital ward setting may further restrict generalizations. </p>

<p>190. II. Isbell et al109 investigated the effects of various
doses of smoked and orally ingested tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)in
a group of former opiate narcotic addicts who had also had
experience with marijuana. The drug was compared to an inactive
placebo control in a single-blind design (i.e., the researchers,
but not the subjects, knew which samples were being tested). </p>

<p>191. Regardless of dose and route of administration, THC
caused no significant change in pupillary size, respiration rate,
blood pressure, or knee-jerk reflex threshold. Heart pulse rate
was consistently elevated, and swelling of the conjunctival blood
vessels in the membrane around the eyes occurred after the higher
doses. In both physiological and psychological measures, THC (at
a standard dose) was found to be two to three times as potent
when smoked as when taken orally. </p>

<p>192. Patients identified the drug as being similar to
marijuana and some suggested that it was something like LSD or
cocaine as well. Euphoria was consistently noted and no mention
was made in the report of unpleasant adverse reactions.
Psychological changes included '. . - alterations in sense of
time and in visual and auditory perception (usually described as
keener).' With higher doses, both smoked and orally ingested, '.
. .marked distortion in visual and auditory perception,
depersonalization, derealization and hallucinations, both
auditory and optical, occurred in most patients. THC, therefore
is a psychotomimetic drug and its psychotomimetic effects are
dependent on dose.' Such occurrences may also appear in some
individuals as 'idiosyncratic' reactions at lower doses. It had
been noted that the symptoms which Isbell has labelled
'psychotomimetic' might be called 'psychedelic' by scientists
with a different orientation. </p>

<p>193. The application of these findings to marijuana use as it
occurs in North America is unclear. Some observers, in both lay
and scientific circles, have interpreted this report as an
indication of the dangers of marijuana, while other scientists
question the relevance of these findings in relation to the 'real
world' of marijuana usage.251 </p>

<p>194. III. In 1968, Weil, Zinberg and Nelsen 239,240 reported
the first adequately controlled experiment on cannabis effects in
humans. The primary section of the study is concerned with
effects on nine subjects who were inexperienced with cannabis.
The researchers gave two different doses of marijuana (0.5 and
1.0gm of 0.9% THC) and an inactive placebo substance in a
controlled 'double-blind' situation - i.e., neither the subjects
nor the researchers knew at the time of the experiment which dose
of cannabis or placebo was administered. This procedure greatly
reduces the influence of expectations and bias on the part of
both subjects and researchers. In addition to the naive subjects,
eight chronic marijuana users (who normally smoked daily or every
other day) were tested with the high dose only. No placebo was
used with these subjects since the authors felt that experienced
marijuana smokers could readily distinguish the placebo from the
'real thing', and consequently a true placebo control was not
possible. Subjects took either the drug or placebo by a standard
and uniform inhalation method designed to minimize practice
effects and individual differences in smoking technique.
Subsequently, they were tested on a battery of standard
psychological and psychomotor tasks, and certain physiological
measurements were taken in a neutral laboratory setting. </p>

<p>195. The physiological findings were quite straightforward:
heart rate was increased moderately, no significant change in
respiration rate occurred, blood sugar level was unchanged
(although the timing of the samples may not have been optimal),
no change in pupil size was seen and a slight swelling of the
conjunctival blood vessels (producing a reddening of the
membranes around the eye) occurred. The researchers suggest that
the near absence of significant physiological effects '... makes
it unlikely that marijuana has any seriously detrimental physical
effects in either a short-term or long-term usage.' </p>

<p>196. The capacity for sustained attention (Continuous
Performance Test) was unaffected by cannabis in both the nave
and chronic user groups, even when a flickering strobe light was
presented to provide distraction. Muscular coordination and
attention performance (Pursuit Rotor Test) declined as dose was
increased in nave subjects, but improved slightly after
marijuana use in the chronic users. (This improvement was
considered a result of practice rather than a drug effect but can
not be properly evaluated due to the lack of a placebo
measurement in the experienced users.) Performance on the Digit
Symbol Substitution Test, (a simple test of cognitive function
often used in I.Q. tests) was impaired in the nave groups,
while the experienced smokers started off at a reasonable base
line and actually improved slightly when they were 'high' - a
trend which can not be accounted for solely by practice. A
tendency to overestimate time was also noted in these subjects.
The researchers caution that the differences between users and
nonusers in this study must only be considered a trend since the
testing situations were not strictly comparable for the two
groups. </p>

<p>197. Subjects were given five minutes to talk on 'an
interesting or dramatic experience' and the content of the verbal
report was analysed. Marijuana did not impair the
understandability of the material as measured by the Cloze
method, although judges could consistently distinguish the
transcripts of pre- and post-drug samples in both the naive and
experienced groups. A 'strange' quality in the post-drug samples
was noted but not easily quantified. The investigators suggested
that marijuana may temporarily interfere with short-term memory -
i.e., the ability to retrieve or remember events occurring in the
past few seconds. They feel that this may explain why many
marijuana smokers, when very 'high', may have trouble
remembering, from moment to moment, the logical thread of what is
being said. Controlled investigation of this hypothesis is
currently under way. </p>

<p>198. The experienced subjects were asked to rate themselves on
a scale from one to ten, with ten representing the 'highest' they
had ever been. Ratings given were between seven and ten, with
most subjects at eight or nine. This would suggest that the
sample was of reasonable potency and the smoking technique
effective. On the other hand, with the same dose and smoking
technique, only one of the naive subjects had, a definite
marijuana 'high'. (Interestingly, he was the one subject who had
earlier expressed an eagerness to 'turn on'.) The researchers
point out that the introspective report of an individual is the
only way to determine if he is 'high' on marijuana or not. There
are, as of yet, no known objective signs which allow one to
identify this state. </p>

<p>199. There was no change in mood in the neutral laboratory
setting in either naive or chronic user subjects, as measured by
self-rating scales and a content analysis of the verbal sample.
There were no adverse marijuana reactions of any kind in any of
the subjects, although tobacco cigarettes smoked during a
practice session, using the standard technique produced acute
nicotine reactions in five subjects which 'were far more
spectacular than any effects produced by marijuana'. The authors
conclude: </p>

<p>In a neutral setting persons who are naive to marijuana do not
have strong subjective experiences after smoking low or high
doses of the drug, and the effects they do report are not the
same as those described by regular users of marijuana who take
the drug in the same neutral setting. Marijuana naive persons do
demonstrate impaired performance on simple intellectual and
psychomotor tests after smoking marijuana; the impairment is
dose-related in some cases. Regular users of marijuana do get
high after smoking marijuana in a neutral setting but do not show
the same degree of impairment of performance on the test as do
naive subjects. In some cases, their performance even appears to
improve slightly after smoking marijuana. </p>

<p>200.<i> The New Republic, </i>in an editorial responding to
this report, wrote: 'While pot heads may legitimately ask,
&quot;So what else is new?&quot; the study may have a pacifying
influence on parents and officials who fear the drug on the basis
of unsubstantiated horror stories.'251 While numerous scientists
have expressed similar views, the study does provide a long
overdue empirically adequate beginning to the scientific study of
marijuana effects on humans. While this study has implications
extending beyond the laboratory, there has been a tendency in the
popular press to overgeneralize from the results. It would be
imprudent to extrapolate the findings into social and legal areas
for which the study was not designed and is not appropriate. </p>

<p>201. IV. Jones and Stone116 in 1969 reported that smoked
marijuana (equivalent to Weil's low dose) compared to a placebo
in ten 'heavy users' resulted in: moderately increased heart
rate, altered electroencephalogram (EEG), over-estimation of time
(but no change in time interval production), no effect on the
ability to attend to relevant internal cues to the exclusion of
irrelevant external cues (Rod and Frame test), and no effect on
the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (the same measure of cognitive
functioning employed in the Weil study). A double dose of
marijuana (comparable to Weil's high dose) produced a deficit in
visual information processing - the only test studied with this
quantity of drug. </p>

<p>202. The subjects were asked to rate the low dose and placebo
on a scale from 0-100 as to marijuana quality. The mean rating
were 66 for the low dose and 57 for the placebo, which was not a
significant difference. While this suggests that the dose of
marijuana used was probably too low to be very effective and may
reduce the significance of the report, it is interesting that the
supposedly inactive 'placebo' (with only a &quot;trace&quot; of
THC) was given a rating suggesting moderate potency by ten heavy
marijuana users in San Francisco. However, it appears that the
subjective effects of the placebo and low dose marijuana, as
measured by a self-rating subjective symptom check-list, may have
been different, although no statistics are presented, and the
figure containing this information does not clearly identify the
placebo. At any rate, these findings suggest that at low doses a
simple 'highness' dimension may not be easy to quantify reliably.
Unfortunately, Weil did not get ratings on his low dose or
placebo, and Jones did not assess the high dose, so a
reconciliation is not possible with the present data. </p>

<p>203. The researchers also studied a larger dose of marijuana
extract (equivalent to 20 cigarettes) given orally, compared with
a placebo and one dose of alcohol (producing blood alcohol levels
of 0.06 to 0.12%). Several tasks were used with the same
subjects. Certain comparisons among the conditions and drugs are
possible, although the use of a single dose and slight variations
in procedure limits the applicability of the findings. </p>

<p>204. The marijuana smoked in low doses produced an
'unimpressive' high with a maximum effect at about 15 minutes and
lasting about three hours, while the oral administration had a
latency of almost two hours, a peak at three to four hours and
mild subjective effects lasting eight to ten hours. The oral dose
of marijuana occasionally produced nausea and in one case
vomiting, and differed from the smoked material on several
subjective dimensions. The results of the comparisons between the
oral marijuana and the placebo were essentially the same as those
discussed earlier for the smoked material. As a point of<i> </i>reference,
the single alcohol dose did not affect performance on the Rod and
Frame Test, produced an underestimation of time intervals,
decreased rate of information processing, did not affect heart
rate, and produced a slowing of the EEG. Little meaningful
comparison can be made between alcohol and the other treatments
at a single dosage level, however. </p>

<p>205. The report is ambiguous and many important details of
methodology and results are excluded in what appears to be a
preliminary investigation. It should be noted that this study has
only single-blind controls and the investigators knew which drugs
were administered at the time of the experiment. </p>

<p>206. V. A third recent experimental study of marijuana effects
on humans was published by Clark and Nakashima46 in 1968 and is
mentioned here since it is now frequently quoted and, also, to
demonstrate some of the problems of interpreting inadequately
controlled experiments. Several different doses of marijuana
extract (of unknown THC content) were given to 12 marijuana naive
subjects, and the effects recorded on eight psychological tests
in 'one control and two or three subsequent sessions'. </p>

<p>207. The study is unintepretable for a variety of reasons,
some of which follow: since the control session and the various
drug doses were given only once, and on separate days, drug and
dose effects are indistinguishably confounded with various
factors of treatment order (including practice and other learning
effects), and natural variations in performance occurring from
one day to the next; the researchers describe no basis,
statistical or otherwise, for distinguishing the 'effects' from
random variation; they report only trends in the data in one or
two subjects selected on an unspecified basis, and give no
indication of overall group effects; the numerical basis for the
figures presented is unspecified; apparently no placebos were
given on the 'control' day which was invariably the first
session, yet the drug is frequently compared with the 'control'
in individual subjects; apparently no 'blind' controls were
provided in either the experiment or later data analysis; and the
report is presented with a strong negative bias in the
introduction and remainder of the article, which is not supported
empirically. The authors infer marijuana-induced impairment only
on the reaction time and 'digit code memory' tasks, although they
provide no reliable evidence for the presence or absence of
positive or negative marijuana effects on these or the other
tests studied. </p>

<p>Clark concludes that great individual variation exists among
individuals in response to the drug. While this would seem a
reasonable observation, effects have not been identified, much
less the variance of their distribution assessed. The great
variability in the data cannot be attributed solely to the drug
for reasons outlined above. In summary, this study, conducted,
financially supported and published by highly accredited
individuals and institutions, adds nothing but confusion to the
existing knowledge and should encourage scepticism regarding even
modern 'scientific' information on marijuana. </p>

<p>208. VI. Last year Crancer and associates,61 from the
Washington State Department of Motor Vehicles, published the
first experimental study of marijuana effects on automobile
driving skills. A laboratory driving simulator was employed which
had been shown previously to validly predict road accidents and
traffic violations on the basis of speedometer, steering,
braking, accelerator and signal errors measured during a
programmed series of 'emergency' situations. This study has
provoked considerable controversy, some of which may be
dissipated if the different sections of the study are examined
separately. </p>

<p>209. Using a sophisticated methodological and statistical
design, the effects of the single dose of marijuana (2
cigarettes) were assessed in 36 experienced marijuana smokers who
used cannabis at least twice a month. In terms of total THC
administered, the dose was about 22% greater than Weil's high
dose and almost 2  times the standard dose used by Jones.
Crancer reports the effects as a 'normal social marijuana high',
although this is not quantified in any way and it is not certain
how this relates to the overall pattern of marijuana use in the
population. Simulator scores were obtained at three intervals
over a 4  hour period. Control (no treatment) sessions were
run, although no placebo substance was used since the
investigators felt that a placebo would not be effective with
experienced marijuana users. </p>

<p>210. Overall performance under the single dose of marijuana
was not different from the control. The main study was followed
by two 'cursory' investigations. Four subjects were retested with
three times the original drug dose and none showed a significant
change in performance. Furthermore, four marijuana naive subjects
were tested after smoking enough marijuana to become 'high' (all
consumed at least the amount used in the main experiment and
demonstrated an increase in heart rate in addition to subjective
effects). No significant change in scores occurred with the drug
in these subjects either. </p>

<p>The investigators caution that the study does not necessarily
indicate that marijuana will not impair driving. </p>

<p>However, we feel that, because the simulator task is a less
complex but related task, deterioration in simulator performance
implies deterioration in actual driving performance. We are less
willing to assume that non-deterioration in simulator performance
implies non-deterioration in actual driving. </p>

<p>211. One weakness of this part of the study is that apparently
no standard and uniform smoking technique was employed and it is
not certain how much of the active principle was actually
absorbed. Although a biochemical method for detecting THC in the
body has recently been developed, quantitative measurements have
not been employed in any experimental marijuana studies. Although
higher doses were tested in some subjects, this was not done with
the same thoroughness as the main experiment and little can be
asserted regarding a dose-response effect of marijuana on
driving. It seems likely that if the dose were pushed high enough
some impairment would occur, although this has not been
empirically demonstrated. </p>

<p>212. In order to obtain some standard reference point for this
study, the subjects were also tested under a single dose of
alcohol, designed to produce a blood alcohol level corresponding
to the legal standard of presumed driving impairment in
Washington (i.e., 0.10% blood alcohol level). The average number
of errors under alcohol (97.4) was significantly greater than
that acquired under either the normal or marijuana condition
(each averaging 84.5 errors). While it is clear that a meaningful
comparison of the two drugs cannot be based on a single dose of
each, the alcohol data were obtained merely to provide a
'recognized standard' of impairment. </p>

<p>Kalant118 has pointed out that the blood alcohol level of
these subjects may have been considerably higher than the desired
0.10%, and that comparisons between the drugs must be made with
caution due to the single doses used. He also suggests that
although it would not have been easy for the subjects to 'fake'
good driving performance under marijuana, an anti-alcohol bias,
as often seen in marijuana users, could have resulted in poorer
performance in the alcohol condition. </p>

<p>If the limitations of the alcohol-marijuana comparison and the
weakness of the marijuana dose-effect generalizations are
realized, the over-all study provides interesting tentative
information on the effects of a moderate quantity of marijuana on
driving skills. </p>

<p>213. VII. In general, studies of the long-term history of
marijuana users have been based either on medical or criminal
samples or on subjects selected because of current use. Each of
these sources of subjects has considerable intrinsic sampling
bias - which greatly complicates the interpretation of results.
Recently, however, Robins and associates,187 reported the first
study of the long-term outcome of marijuana use in a group not
selected for deviant behaviour. The subjects were 235 Negro men
who had gone to public elementary school in the black district of
St. Louis, Missouri, in the early 1940s. While the
characteristics of such a population may have questionable
applicability to present marijuana use in Canada, this generally
thorough study should be carefully considered. The data are
largely based on recent retrospective personal interviews and
official records. Subjects were classified according to
adolescent drug use. </p>

<p>214. Persons in this sample who had used marijuana (and no
other drug except alcohol) differed significantly from
non-marijuana users, in that the users had more often: drunk
heavily enough to create social or medical problems, failed to
graduate from high school, reported their own infidelity or
fathering of illegitimate children, received financial aid, had
adult police records for non-drug offences, and reported violent
behaviour. While these findings indicate an association between
marijuana use and these other behavioural characteristics in this
population, causal variables have not been identified. </p>

<p>215. The heavy use of alcohol in these subjects complicates
the interpretation considerably. Every marijuana user also used
alcohol, and drinking usually preceded marijuana use. Among the
subjects who used only marijuana and alcohol, 47% had medical or
social problems attributable to drinking ('the
&quot;shakes&quot;, liver trouble, family complaints, arrests,
etc.') after the age of 25, and 38% of the users met the criteria
for alcoholism. When those subjects who were classified as
alcoholics were eliminated from the data (and the remainder of
the problem drinkers left in) the only statistically significant
difference between the marijuana users and the non-users was with
respect to financial aid received in the past five years.
Non-significant trends remained, however, which were generally
similar to the earlier differences. Subjects who used 'harder'
drugs (e.g., heroin, amphetamines and barbiturates) in addition
to marijuana were significantly more deviant than the non-users,
even after the alcoholics had been eliminated from the sample.
Almost one-half of the subjects who had used marijuana also had
used other drugs illegally. </p>

<p>The alcoholics, in addition to having a history of early
drinking, were also more likely to have used marijuana as
adolescents. Unfortunately, no record of intensity of early
drinking or marijuana use was obtained. A possible causal
relationship between marijuana use and problem drinking, or
vice-versa, or a possible third set of factors predisposing
certain individuals to both alcoholism and marijuana use cannot
be established or denied on the basis of the present data. The
relationship between marijuana use and the use of harder drugs is
also troublesome. </p>

<p>The authors conclude: </p>

<p>One small study of the effects of drug use in 76 Negro
adolescents can hardly serve to determine the laws of the land.
But it may at least make us cautious in too readily supporting
the view that marijuana is harmless, until some better evidence
is available. </p>

<p>216. VIII. The Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario has
recently conducted a study of 232 confirmed marijuana users in
Toronto.173 Prisons and court referrals provided about half of
the subjects and the remainder were volunteers not contacted
through criminal-legal channels. The majority came from
middle-class or upper middle-class homes and 16% were students.
The average age was 22 (range: 15-42) and males outnumbered
females 4 to 1. The average duration of marijuana use was 2.7
years (range: 1-20). </p>

<p>217. Preliminary observations suggest the following
characteristics in this sample: the subjects tended to be
multiple drug users (tobacco and alcohol were used by almost all
of the subjects, more than half had tried LSD and speed, and
one-third had tried opiate narcotics); most had 'trafficked' in
marijuana, but usually just to friends; cannabis was generally
used about twice a week in the company of friends, accompanied by
passive rather than active behaviour; purported reasons for use
were increased perception and awareness, other psychedelic
effects, improved mood, and conviviality. Almost all subjects
found the usual effects favourable although about a third had had
at least one unpleasant experience (physiological or
psychological) with the drug; about half had driven a car while
under the influence of cannabis, and of these subjects, more than
half felt that their driving ability was unimpaired by the drug;
about half felt that cannabis had improved their lives, while
some thought it had worsened things; the subjects 'tended to be
underactive physically, engaging in passive pursuits'; about
one-third subscribed to the belief in the 'protestant work
ethic', while almost as many rejected it; almost one-third had
committed non-drug criminal offences; one-half showed a swelling
of the fine conjunctival blood vessels around the eye;
nonspecific deviant EEGs were frequently seen; more than half
were thought by a psychiatrist to be psychologically unstable or
disturbed; and the group as a whole tended to be more imaginative
and creative than what would be expected in the general
population. </p>

<p>218. The researchers stress that their findings demonstrate an
association, and not necessarily a causal relationship, between
the regular use of cannabis and other characteristics in this
sample. While some of these results may be attributable to the
selection or bias of the sample (e.g., half were contacted
through criminal correction channels), much of the information
may have general application. On-going analysis of the data
should further clarify the results, although the lack of a
comparable matched control group will undoubtedly preclude
certain generalizations since we have little information
regarding the incidence of many of the aforementioned
characteristics in non-marijuana using individuals of similar
social, economic and educational backgrounds. Furthermore, the
frequent use of other drugs by these subjects may limit
conclusions specific to cannabis use. </p>

<p>219. IX. In response to questions raised in the British House
of Commons, the Government of India, in 1893, appointed a
commission to investigate and report on the cannabis ('hemp
drugs') situation in India. The commission was instructed to
inquire into the extent to which the hemp plant was cultivated,
the preparation of drugs from it, the trade in those drugs, the
extent of their use, and the effects of their consumption upon
the social, physical, mental, and moral conditions of the people.
The different forms of the drug, especially bhang, ganja, and
charas (hashish), were to be studied separately. The Commission
'&#133;should ascertain whether, and in what form, the
consumption of the drugs is either harmless or even beneficial as
has occasionally been maintained'. In addition, they were asked
to investigate certain economic aspects of the use of hemp (e.g.,
tax arrangements and import and export patterns), and also the
potential political, social or religious results of prohibition. <i>The
Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission </i>(1894),107
including appendices, comprised seven volumes and totalled 3,281
pages. </p>

<p>220. In 1968, Mikuriya,158 in the first thorough discussion of
this report to appear in the Western scientific literature,
suggested that this investigation </p>

<p>. . . is by far the most complete, and systematic study of
marijuana undertaken to date.... It is both surprising and
gratifying to note the timeless and lucid quality of the writings
of these British colonial bureaucrats. It would be fortunate if
studies undertaken by contemporary commissions, task force
committees, and study groups could measure up to the standard of
thoroughness and general objectivity embodied in this report ...
many of the issues concerning marijuana being argued in the
United States today were dealt with in the Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission Report. </p>

<p>Until recently only about a half dozen copies of this report
were available in North America. In the introduction to a new
printing of the primary volume in 1969, Kaplan121 observed: </p>

<p>That this report, which remains today by far the most complete
collection of information on marijuana in existence, should have
been so completely forgotten in an era when controversy over the
effects of the drug and, the wisdom of its criminalization has
increased to such fervor is almost inexplicable. </p>

<p>221. The Indian Hemp Drugs Commission received testimony from
1,193 witnesses of a total of 80 meeting in 30 cities. Over 300
medical practitioners were consulted and inquiries were made of
Commanding Officers of all regiments of the Army, The
commissioners investigated the records of every mental hospital
in British India and evaluated separately each of the 222 cases
admitted during the year 1892, in which some connection between
hemp drugs and insanity had been suggested (these made up about
10 per cent of all admissions) Furthermore, all 81 cases of
crimes of violence in India purported to have been caused by
cannabis over the previous 20 years were investigated and
re-examined. In addition, three laboratory experiments were
conducted with monkeys to study the effects of cannabis on the
nervous system. </p>

<p>222. In the short time during which the full report has been
available to us, we have not been able to prepare, at this
interim stage, a thorough critical analysis of the document.
However, the following quotations, taken from the summary of
conclusions regarding the effects of hemp drugs, provide an
overview of the findings: </p>

<p>It has been clearly established that the occasional use of
hemp in moderate doses may be beneficial. In regard to the
physical effects, the Commission have come to the conclusion that
the moderate use of hemp drugs, is practically attended by no
evil results at all. There may be exceptional cases in which,
owing to idiosyncrasies of constitution, the drugs in even
moderate use of hemp drugs in even moderate use may be injurious,
excessive use does cause injury. As in the case of other
intoxicants, excessive use tends to weaken the constitution and
to render the consumer more susceptible to disease &#133; the
excessive use of these drugs does not cause asthma. . . it may
indirectly cause dysentery ... (and) it may cause bronchitis. </p>

<p>In respect to the alleged mental effects of the drugs, the
Commission have come to the conclusion that the moderate use of
hemp drugs produces no injurious effects on the mind.... It is
otherwise with the excessive use. Excessive use indicates and
intensifies mental instability... It appears that the excessive
use of hemp drugs may, especially in cases where there is any
weakness or hereditary predisposition, induce insanity. It has
been shown that the effect of hemp drugs in this respect has
hitherto been greatly exaggerated, but that they do sometimes
produce insanity seems beyond question. </p>

<p>In regard to the moral effects of the drugs, the Commission
are of opinion that their moderate use produces no moral injury
whatever. There is no adequate ground for believing that it
injuriously affects the character of the consumer. Excessive
consumption, on the other hand, both indicates and intensifies
moral weakness or depravity. . . . In respect to his relations
with society, however, even the excessive consumer of hemp drugs
is ordinarily inoffensive. His excesses may indeed bring him to
degraded poverty which may lead him to dishonest practices; and
occasionally, but apparently very rarely indeed, excessive
indulgence in hemp drugs may lead to violent crime. But for all
practical purposes it may be laid down that there is little or no
connection between the use of hemp drugs and crime. </p>

<p>Viewing the subject generally, it may be added that the
moderate use of these drugs is the rule, and that the excessive
use is comparatively exceptional. The moderate use practically
produces no ill effects. In all but the most exceptional cases,
the injury from habitual moderate use is not appreciable. The
excessive use may certainly be accepted as very injurious, though
it must be admitted that in many excessive consumers the injury
is not clearly marked. The injury done by the excessive use is,
however, confined almost exclusively to the consumer himself; the
effect on society is rarely appreciable. It has been the most
striking feature in this inquiry to find how little the effects
of hemp drugs have obtruded themselves on observation. </p>

<p>As noted earlier in this chapter, any generalizations from one
culture to another must be made with great caution. In this
instance, extrapolation to the present Canadian situation would
have to span three-quarters of a century as well. In spite of
these clear limitations, the thoroughness of this critical
inquiry commands respect and the report deserves careful
consideration. <br>
