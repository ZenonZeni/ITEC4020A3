<H3><A NAME="principal_findings">PRINCIPAL FINDINGS</A><!--PRINCIPLE FINDINGS--></h3>

The principal findings of the study are presented under the following categories: <P>
<B>1.0 Characteristics of respondents and incidents;</B> <P>
<B>2.0 Police behaviour; and </B> <P>
<B>3.0 Details about the outcome of the incident.</B> <P>
Each section will be followed by a brief summary of the results. Finally the data is analysed and recommendations are made based on the findings of the survey. <P>
<B><A NAME="s1_0">1.0 CHARACTERISTICS OF RESPONDENTS AND INCIDENTS <B></B> </A></B> <P>
Information was collected about respondents gender, age, place of residence, occupation, country of birth, Aboriginality, language, prior police mistreatment of respondents and the time and place of incidents.<B> </B>Detailed tables are in Appendix 3. <P>
1.1 Gender of Respondents  <!--  0Figure 2.<I> Respondents' Gender</I> -->  <P>
71% of respondents were male, 28% female (see Appendix 3. <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.1.1">Table 3.1.1</a>). <!-- PRE> Figure 0.<I> Respondents' Age</I> </PRE -->  <P>
1.2 Age of Respondents <P>
27% of respondents were between 17 and 20 years old and 64% were aged under 30 years (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.1.2">Appendix 3 Table 3.1.2</a>). <!-- PRE> Figure 0.  <I>Respondent Address </I>  </PRE -->  <P>
<B>1.3 Address of Respondents<!--1.3 Address of Respondents--> </B> <P>
Respondents addresses identified 61 postcode areas, a concentration of metropolitan and outer metropolitan addresses with a spread throughout rural regional centres and outlying country areas. Flemington, Footscray and North Melbourne were most frequent (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.1.3">Appendix 3 Table 3.1.3).</a> <!-- PRE> Figure 0. <I>Respondents' Occupation</I> </PRE -->  <P>
<B>1.4 Occupation of Respondent</B> <P>
Over one third of respondents were unemployed, and a further 32% were either students or pensioners. This means that at least three quarters of all respondents had no work (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.1.4">Appendix 3 Table 3.1.4</a>).  <!--PRE> 0Figure 6.  <I> Respondents' Country of Birth</I>   </PRE-->  <P>
<B>1.5 Country of Birth</B> <P>
Some 69% of respondents were born in Australia. No respondents indicated that they were Koori. Nineteen other countries of birth were identified, with Vietnam 9.5%, the United Kingdom 5.3% and New Zealand, 3.2% having the largest numbers. Each of the following countries was also represented: Malaysia, El Salvador, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Argentina, Ethiopia, Holland, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Sweden and the United States (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.1.5">Appendix 3 Table 3.1.5</a>). <P>
12% of respondents preferred to speak a language other than English. Of these a total of 18 individuals preferred to speak Vietnamese with the remaining languages being Laotian, Kymer, Thai, Spanish and Macedonian.  <P>
<B>1.6 Previous Police Mistreatment.</B> <P>
At least 49% of the respondents indicated that they had previously been mistreated by the police (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.1.6">Appendix 3 Table 3.1.6</a>). Of these respondents who had been previously mistreated, 23% indicated that they had made a formal complaint on a previous incident of mistreatment. <!--PRE> Figure 0. <I> Place of Incident</I> </PRE-->  <P>
<B>1.7 Place of Incident</B> <P>
Incidents reported by respondents occurred most frequently in St Kilda, Footscray and Flemington (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.1.7">Appendix 3 Table 3.1.7</a>).  <P>
<B>1.8 Time of incident</B> <!--PRE> <B>Figure 0.<I> Time of Incident</I></B> </PRE-->  <P>
Over half of the reported incidents occurred between 5.00pm and 9.00am., a further one third occurred between 9.00am and 5.00pm (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.1.8">Appendix 3 Table 3.1.8</a>). <P>
Analysis according to normal police shift times shows that 49% of incidents occurred during afternoon shift, that is between 3.00pm and 11.00pm. and a further 30% occurred during day shift, between 7.00am and 3.00pm <P>
<B>1.9 SUMMARY</B> <P>
The typical victim who responded in the 1992 survey is a male, under the age of 30. He is likely to reside in the greater metropolitan area of Melbourne and not to be in the paid workforce. <P>
Over one third of respondents have been previously mistreated by the police and one third stated that they were born overseas. While language is not a problem for many respondents it affected almost half of those who indicated that they were born overseas.  <P>
St Kilda, Footscray and Flemington were the most frequent locations of reported police mistreatment and the largest proportion occurred during afternoon shift. <H3><A NAME="s2_0">2.0 POLICE BEHAVIOUR</A></h3>

This section of the report describes the characteristics of the police involved in the reported mistreatment the nature of the reported mistreatment and the type of place in which the mistreatment occurred. Detailed tables are presented in <a href="police6.htm#a3">Appendix 3</a>.  <P>
<B>2.1. Number of Police Involved</B> <P>
In 40% of incidents there were at least 2 police involved. In a further 15% of incidents there were 4 police involved. In 21.4% of cases there were 5 or more police officers involved (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.1">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.1</a>.) <I> (See also <a href="police4.htm#cs21">Case Study 21</a>)</I>. <P>
<B>2.2 Characteristics of Police Involved</B> <P>
<B>2.2.1<I> Gender</I> </B> <P>
In 40% of all reported cases there was at least one policewoman involved. However in incidents involving female respondents, female officers were present in only 23.0% (N=26) of all cases.<I> (See also <a href="police4.htm#cs17">Case study 17</a>).</I> <P>
<B>2.2.2<I> Uniform</I></B> <P>
In 75% of incidents police were in a uniform, in 14% they were not in uniform and in 7.0% no answer was recorded.  <P>
<B>2.2.3<I> Rank</I></B> <P>
Of the 92 victims able to identify the ranks of police involved, 58% were identified as constables, 11% were senior constables, 20% were sergeants and 10% involved a detective (unspecified rank) (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.2">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.2</a>).  <P>
<B>2.2.4<I> Special police squad</I></B> <P>
Special police squads were identified as being involved in mistreatment in 37 incidents: <ul>
<li>15 reported incidents involved the CIB; 
<li>12 involved the Transit Patrol; 
<li>4 involved the Drug Squad ; 
<li>3 involved the Asia Squad; 
<li>3 involved the Armed Robbery Squad; and  
<li>3 involved the Major Crime Squad.  </ul>
Other incidents involved the Community Policing Squad, Homicide, the Traffic Operations Group and the involvement of officers from Community Services Victoria. <P>
<B>2.2.5<I> Identification</I></B> <P>
In 47% incidents the police identified themselves to their victims.  <!--PRE> Figure 0.  <I>Location of Incident</I> </PRE-->  <P>
<B>2.3 Location of Incident </B> <P>
34% of all reported incidents occurred within the confines of a police station, 23% occurred in the persons' home, 23% occurred in the street and 7% occurred in public toilets (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.3">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.3</a>).    <P>
<B>2.3.1<I> Location of Police Station</i></B> <P>
The largest proportion of reported police station incidents occurred at St Kilda police station. Other stations with large numbers of incidents include Footscray and Flemington (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.3.1">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.3.1</a>). <P>
<B>2.3.2<I> Gender and Place of Incident</I></B> <P>
There was a statistically significant relationship between gender and place of incident. Women were 50% more likely than men to report mistreatment in their homes. Men were more likely to report mistreatment in public toilets and railway stations. There was no difference between the proportions of male and female victims mistreated in police stations and on the street (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.3.2">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.3.2</a>). <P>
<B>2.3.3<I> Age and Place of Incident </I></B> <P>
There was a significant relationship between age and place of incident. Respondents aged over 25 years were more likely than other respondents to report mistreatment at home. Respondents aged under 16 years were more likely to report mistreatment in public toilets. There was no significant relationship between age and mistreatment in police stations (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.3.3">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.3.3</a>). <P>
<B>2.3.4<I> Language Preference and Place of Incident </I></B> <P>
There was no statistically significant relationship between preferred language of respondents and place of incident (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.3.4">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.3.4</a>). <P>
<B><a name = "s2_4">2.4 Nature of Mistreatment </a> </B> <P>
Respondents were given a choice of 14 categories of types of mistreatment to ensure consistency in their responses. Up to three responses were coded as it was felt that the use of three categories would provide sufficient data to provide an understanding of the types of mistreatment being experienced. This means that percentages add up to more than 100%. Table 1. summarises the number of incidents for the 10 most common categories of mistreatment. Verbal and physical abuse were the most frequently reported forms of police mistreatment but threats, racial abuse and denial of legislative rights to third party witnesses were also common.<I> (See also Case Studies <a href="police4.htm#cs11">11</a>, <a href="police4.htm#cs14">14</a>, <a href="police4.htm#cs15">15</a>, <a href="police4.htm#cs16">16</a> and <a href="police4.htm#cs18">18</a>)</I>. <P>

<HR>  <P>
<B>2.4.2<I> Type of Injury and Place of Incident </I></B> <P>
Bruising and broken bones from mistreatment in police stations comprised the greatest number of injuries reported by respondents. This was followed by similar injuries received in homes and on the street (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.4.2">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.4.2</a>). <I>(See also Case Study <a href="police4.htm#cs2">2</a>, <a href="police4.htm#cs3">3</a>, <a href="police4.htm#cs6">6</a>, <a href="police4.htm#cs8">8</a>, <a href="police4.htm#cs9">9</a>, <a href="police4.htm#cs10">10</a>, <a href="police4.htm#cs12">12</a>).</I> <P>
<B>2.5 Respondents Informed of Their Right to Complain about Police Treatment</B> <P>
Only 20% of respondents say they were told that they had the right to complain about their treatment by police (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.5">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.5</a>).  <P>
<B>2.5.1<I> Gender and Whether Respondent Informed of Right to Complain about Police Treatment</I></B> <P>
There was no significant difference between male and female respondents in the frequency with which they say they were informed of their right to complain about police treatment (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.5.1">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.5.1</a>).<P>
<B>2.5.2<I> Age and Whether Respondent Informed of Right to Complain about Police Treatment</I></B> <P>
There was a significant relationship between age and whether the respondent said he or she had been informed of his or her right to complain about police treatment (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.5.2">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.5.2</a>). Those aged under 16 years, 17-20 years or 21-24 years were more likely to have been informed of their rights. The highest proportion informed of their rights (21-24 y.o) was 34.5%. The highest not informed was for (25-28 y.o) at 90%. <P>
<B>2.5.3<I> Language Preference and Whether Respondent Informed of Right to Complain about Police Treatment</B></I> <P>
There was no significant relationship between language preference of respondents and their saying they were informed of their right to complain about police behaviour. Although only 13% of non-English language preference respondents and 21% of English speakers were informed of their right to complain about police mistreatment (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.5.3">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.5.3</a>).  <P>
<B>2.5.4 Police Station and Whether Informed of Rights </B> 
In 25 police stations the respondents say they were not informed of their rights to complain. These numbers were highest in St Kilda, City West and Flemington (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.2.5.4">Appendix 3 Table 3.2.5.4</a>).  <P>
<B>2.5.5 Previous Formal Complaint</B> <P>
Over 56% of respondents reported previous police mistreatment and, of these, 22% had made a formal complaint. Therefore, overall, only 11% of the respondents who alleged police mistreatment in this survey already knew about the complaint system from previous experience of complaining. <P>
<B>2.6 Interpreter for Non-English Speaking Respondents</b><p>
An interpreter was present for only eight 30%(N=8) of 23 respondents who preferred to use a language other than English. An independent interpreter was used in four of these cases and one case used the telephone interpreting service. (See also <a href="police4.htm#cs4">Case Study 4</a>)  <P>
Five respondents indicated that police did not offer an interpreter. A further 11 indicated that an interpreter was not present for other reasons such as their being unaware of their rights or that they lacked the English speaking skills to ask for an interpreter. (See <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.3.2.1">Appendix 3 Table 3.3.2.1</a>) Although 70% of individuals indicating that they preferred a language other than English and may have been wrongly denied the help of an interpreter caution should be used in interpreting these figures as the actual numbers are low. <P>
<B>2.7 SUMMARY</B> <P>
In summary, police mistreatment reported by respondents usually involved more than one constable or senior constable. Female police officers were involved in more incidents involving men than women respondents. Nearly half of the police officers identified themselves. One third of incidents occurred in police stations. This proportion was independent of gender, age and language preference. Women and respondents aged over 25 years were more likely to report mistreatment in their homes. <P>
Verbal and physical abuse, particularly bruising and broken bones, were the most frequently reported forms of mistreatment stated in the survey. Bruising was most frequently inflicted in police stations, at home or on the street. Incidents involving broken bones usually occurred in police stations and private houses.  <P>
Most respondents say they were not informed of their right to complain about police behaviour. These numbers were highest in St Kilda, City West and Flemington police stations. This was not generally related to gender, age or language preference. <H3><A NAME="s3_0">3.0 DETAILS ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THE INCIDENT </A></h3>

The outcomes of incidents reported by respondents include the legal consequences of the event, the time they were detained in police custody and their formal and informal reporting of the alleged police misbehaviour. <P>
<B>3.1 Legal Consequences of the Incident</B> <P>
About 61% of respondents said they were charged with offences as the result of their interaction with police. Of these cases 27% were charged with assault, 22% with theft, 13% with drunk and disorderly and 10% with drug offences. Other charges included transit offences, wilful trespass, unlawful possession, exceeding 0.05%, breaking and enter, indecent language and offensive behaviour.  <P>
About 30% of all respondents said they were arrested. A further 22% were charged on summons, 5% were cautioned and 2% involved protection order applications. Other cases involved holding in cells, fingerprinting or photographing but no other reported legal action (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.3.1">Appendix 3 Table 3.3.1</a>).  <P>
In another 23% of cases, respondents said that no legal action against them was taken by police. About 67% of respondents reported that a statement had been taken by police and 28% indicated that no statement was taken. <P>
<B>3.2 Length of Time in Custody </B> <P>
At least 53% of respondents indicated that they were taken into police custody. About 70% of respondents who were taken into custody were Australian born. The next largest groups were born in Vietnam (10%), United Kingdom (5%) and New Zealand (3%). Other countries of origin included Malaysia, Italy, U.S.A., Bulgaria, Poland, Ethiopia, Holland, Turkey, Greece, Argentina, Cambodia, Sweden, Thailand, Laos and El Salvador. <P>
Over 61% of these respondents spent four hours or less in custody, 28% spent between 5 and 8 hours, and 11% spent more than 9 hours in custody (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.3.2">Appendix 3 Table 3.3.2</a>). <P>
<B>3.2.1 <I>Gender and Length of Time in Custody</I></B> <P>
Women were more likely than men to spend less than four hours in custody (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.3.2.1">Appendix 3 Table 3.3.2.1</a>). However, although the majority of survey respondents were male, females had been taken into custody in roughly similar proportions. <P>
<B>3.2.2<I> Age and Length of Time in Custody</I></b><P>
The proportion of respondents detained in custody for more than nine hours increased with age (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.3.2.2">Appendix 3 Table 3.3.2.2</a>) with no one in the under 16 year category being detained that long. <P>
<B>3.3 Report of Incident</B> <P>
About 60% of respondents indicated that they had not reported the current incident, 38% indicated that they had made a formal complaint and 2% did not respond to this question.  <P>
<B>3.3.1<I> Formal Report of Current Incident </I></B><P>
Respondents who had formally complained usually did so to lawyers or the Victoria Police Internal Investigations Department.  <P>

<B>3.3.2<I> Informal Discussion of Current Incident</I></B> <P>
While many people who are mistreated by the police do not make formal complaints, quite often they do discuss their mistreatment with other professionals. In this survey 70% of respondents indicated that they had discussed their mistreatment with other professionals.  <P>
Over half of those who reported their mistreatment informally, did so to a community worker. Others discussed it with parents and friends. A further 5 cases relating to the transit patrol were reported to the Ministry of Transport. The remainder had discussed it with a range of individuals including their solicitor and Legal Aid. (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.3.3.2">Appendix 3 Table 3.3.3.2</a>) <P>
<B>3.3.3<I> Reason for Not Reporting Current Incident</I></B> <P>
The most common reasons given for non-reporting are as follows:  <P>
*39% were frightened <P>
*29% said that it would not have achieved anything  <P>
*12% were scared of reprisals <P>
* 3% said threats were made to them , and  <P>
*14% didn't know how. <P>
There was a significant relationship between preference for English language and the reason for not reporting. Over 50% of non-English speakers said they were frightened. In contrast, only 37% of English speakers said they did not make a formal report because they were frightened and a further 31% said it would not achieve anything (see <a href="police6.htm#Table 3.3.3.3">Appendix 3 Table 3.3.3.3</a>). There was no significant relationship between the reasons given by respondents for not reporting the incident and their gender or age.  <P>
<B><A NAME="s3_4">3.4 SUMMARY<B></B></A></B> <P>
Only 60% of respondents were charged with offences arising out of their interaction with the police and over 50% were detained in custody. Of these respondents, 60% were detained for less than 4 hours. The period of detention was greater for men than for women respondents and increased with age. Although the majority of survey respondents were male, females had been taken into custody in roughly similar proportions. <P>
Nearly 40% of respondents formally complained about their mistreatment by police to their lawyer or the Internal Investigations Department of Victoria Police. The high frequency with which complaints were made to lawyers may reflect the project's auspicing by the Federation of Community Legal Centres. About 70% discussed the incident in a less formal professional environment, usually with community workers.  <P>
Most respondents who had not complained said they were too frightened or cynical of the consequences of their complaint. Only 14% said they did not know how to complain. There was no relationship between gender or age and respondents' reasons for not making a formal complaint. However, respondents who preferred to speak a language other than English were more likely than English speakers to say they were too frightened to make a complaint. On the other hand, English speakers were more likely to say that a complaint would not achieve anything.
