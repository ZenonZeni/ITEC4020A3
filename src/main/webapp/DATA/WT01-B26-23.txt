<p> CHAPTER 1 </p>

<p> INTRODUCTION </p>

<p> Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) is currently the
Nation's predominant school-based drug prevention program, and
both its prevalence and popularity continue to expand. The
D.A.R.E. program, designed to prevent students' use of tobacco,
alcohol, and other drugs, uses trained, uniformed police officers
in the classroom to teach a highly structured curriculum.
Developed by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los
Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) as a collaborative
venture, the primary or core D.A.R.E. curriculum is directed
toward pupils in the final grade of elementary school (usually
grade 5 or 6). Additional curricula for students in kindergarten
through fourth grade, junior high school, senior high school, and
for parents have been developed and implemented. </p>

<p> Purpose of the Study </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s popularity, as demonstrated by the extraordinary
growth in its rate of dissemination and by abundant anecdotal
reports of its success, is self-evident. In part because of its
preeminent position, policymakers, researchers, educators, and
parents are asking a number of fundamental questions about the
program: </p>

<p> o How effective is D.A.R.E. in preventing drug use? </p>

<p> o What are D.A.R.E.'s effects compared with those of other
school-based drug prevention programs? </p>

<p> o What are some of the basic features common to most D.A.R.E.
programs? </p>

<p> o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. program? </p>

<p> o How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide? </p>

<p> o How do other alcohol and drug prevention programs compare
with D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with them? </p>

<p> To address these and other questions, the National Institute
of Justice (NIJ) awarded the research team of the Research
Triangle Institute (RTI) and the University of Kentucky's Center
for Prevention Research (CPR) a grant to conduct an extensive
review of the D.A.R.E. program and to assess its place within the
context of the broad spectrum of school-based drug prevention
efforts. </p>

<p> Study Objectives </p>

<p> The research team proposed and carried out two distinct types
of assessments, the first pertaining to implementation and the
second to outcomes or effectiveness. The primary objectives of
the implementation assessment were to </p>

<p> o assess the organizational structure and operation of
representative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; </p>

<p> o review and assess factors that contribute to the effective
implementation of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide; and </p>

<p> o assess how D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug prevention
programs are tailored to meet the needs of specific populations. </p>

<p> The first two objectives for the implementation assessment
relate exclusively to D.A.R.E. The third targets D.A.R.E. but
also includes other drug use prevention programs. </p>

<p> The primary objectives of the outcome assessment were to </p>

<p> o identify all outcome evaluations of D.A.R.E.'s core
curriculum conducted to date in the United States and Canada; </p>

<p> o assess the methodological rigor of those evaluations; </p>

<p> o examine the nature and extent of the effects of D.A.R.E.'s
core curriculum; and </p>

<p> o compare the effectiveness of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum
with that of other school-based drug use prevention programs
targeting 5th- and 6th-grade pupils. </p>

<p> Although the first three objectives of the outcome assessment
focus exclusively on D.A.R.E., the fourth places D.A.R.E. in a
larger context by comparing it with other drug prevention
programs. </p>

<p> In this report, we synthesize the most important findings
from both of the assessments and present overall conclusions, and
some recommendations. </p>

<p> Description of the Study </p>

<p> To achieve the study's goals and objectives, the research
team designed a set of research strategies that would yield data
pertinent not only to a review and critique of D.A.R.E., but also
to an assessment of how D.A.R.E. compares with other school-based
drug prevention programs, and of future directions for these
programs. </p>

<p> For the implementation assessment, we collected original data
by conducting </p>

<p> o informal interviews and discussions with the coordinators
and/or educational advisors of D.A.R.E.'s Regional Training
Centers (RTCs); </p>

<p> o a survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators; and </p>

<ul>
    <li>a survey of drug prevention coordinators in a
        representative, stratified sample of school districts
        that included districts with and without D.A.R.E. </li>
    <li>We also conducted site visits to two pairs of schools
        (one school in each pair had D.A.R.E. and the other did
        not). We discuss the methodologies used for each
        component of the implementation assessment in Section II
        of this report. </li>
</ul>

<p> For the outcome assessment, the research team conducted a
review and assessment of the published and unpublished
evaluations of D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum conducted to date. We
collected no primary data, but instead studied prior D.A.R.E.
evaluations using meta- analytic techniques. The methodologies we
used for the outcome assessment are presented in Section III of
this report. </p>

<p> At the conclusion of our data collection and analysis
efforts, the research team joined Tom Colthurst of the University
of California at San Diego Extension Program in March 1993 to
host a conference in San Diego, California, titled
&quot;Evaluating School-Linked Prevention Strategies Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Other Drugs.&quot; Almost an entire day of this
3-day conference for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners
centered on the preliminary results from this study. This
conference provided an opportunity to disseminate early study
findings from both the implementation and outcome assessments,
and to incorporate participants' responses (including responses
from D.A.R.E. America as well as D.A.R.E. and other drug
prevention researchers) to the findings in this final report. </p>

<p> Strengths and Limitations of the Study </p>

<p> We believe our approach to this study was fully responsive to
NIJ's solicitation. Among the many strengths of this approach are
the following: </p>

<p> o a multifaceted study methodology that collected information
from the national, regional, State, and school district levels of
D.A.R.E. and reviewed all short- term evaluations of the D.A.R.E.
core curricula conducted to date; </p>

<p> o a rigorous examination and synthesis of the results of
previous evaluations of D.A.R.E.; and </p>

<p> o incorporation into this final report of both formal and
informal feedback from researchers and practitioners attending
the dissemination conference. </p>

<p> However, we recognize that there are limitations to our
study, due primarily to limitations in the resources available to
us. For example, our study budget would not allow us to survey
local D.A.R.E. officers and classroom teachers, or monitor the
delivery of D.A.R.E. in the classroom. Additionally, some
questions raised in NIJ's solicitation, such as issues relating
to the effectiveness of the regional and State D.A.R.E. training
centers, could be answered only in part. A complete answer would
have required a many-layered study that examined training
centers' objectives, how these objectives are put into effect
through training received both by trainers and by D.A.R.E.
officers, and ultimately how the officers perform in the
classroom. This was clearly outside the scope of this study. We
also were limited in assessing certain questions, such as
variability in effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. curriculum by the
sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents because of
the lack of research in this area (see Chapter 8 for further
details). </p>

<p> Given the level of resources available for this study, the
research design required some compromises among the multiple
objectives invoked in NIJ's stated purposes, goals, objectives,
and program strategies. </p>

<p> However, the research team believes that the study represents
an optimal mix of data collection methods and sources.
Discussions with members of the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory
Board and other officials associated with the D.A.R.E. training
centers, when combined with information gathered from the survey
of State D.A.R.E. coordinators, provided answers to the questions
relating specifically to the structure and operations of the
D.A.R.E. program. The survey of school district drug prevention
coordinators yielded information about D.A.R.E. and its
relationship to other school-based drug prevention programs. The
site visits provided an illustrative, if unrepresentative,
snapshot of D.A.R.E.'s implementation in two schools. A rigorous
examination of past D.A.R.E. evaluations provided information on
the effects of the program on students. </p>

implementation assessment. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 2 </p>

<p> OVERVIEW AND HISTORY OF SCHOOL-BASED DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMS
AND D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> History of School-Based Drug Prevention Programs School-based
educational programs are the most common approach to drug
prevention aimed at young people. </p>

<p> Prevention efforts are located in educational settings </p>

<p> both because drug use typically begins during adolescence </p>

<p> and because classrooms provide the best opportunity for </p>

<p> reaching a large number of youth simultaneously.=20 </p>

<p> Although rates of drug use among U.S. students generally </p>

<p> have been declining over the past few years (University </p>

<p> of Michigan, 1994), these rates are still higher than </p>

<p> rates of all other Western industrialized nations. =20 </p>

<p> The U.S. Congress reacted to concerns about youth </p>

<p> drug use by enacting the Drug-Free Schools and </p>

<p> Communities Act (DFSCA) of 1986. The DFSCA was designed </p>

<p> to establish programs of drug abuse education and </p>

<p> prevention throughout the Nation. A key part of the </p>

<p> DFSCA is Subtitle B of Title IV, which provides Federal </p>

<p> money to States, schools, and communities to initiate or </p>

<p> expand drug prevention programs. Actions resulting from </p>

<p> Subtitle B of Title IV quickly resulted in the single </p>

<p> largest drug prevention activity offered by the Federal </p>

<p> Government, reaching $498,565,000 in FY 1993.=20 </p>

<p> Research conducted by RTI staff concerning the </p>

<p> implementation of State and local programs of the DFSCA </p>

<p> found that in the 1988-1989 school year all 50 States, </p>

<p> the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto </p>

<p> Rico have actively participated in programs funded by the </p>

<p> DFSCA at the State and local levels. Of all the school </p>

<p> districts in the Nation, 78% reported that they received </p>

<p> DFSCA funding, either directly or through regional or </p>

<p> county education organizations (Thorne, Holley, Wine, </p>

<p> Hayward, &amp; Ringwalt, 1991). </p>

<p> The DFSCA funds appear to have had a positive </p>

<p> effect on the school-based prevention programs of school </p>

<p> districts. To be eligible for DFSCA funding, schools </p>

<p> must implement a comprehensive drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> More than half of the districts receiving DFSCA funding </p>

<p> reported that since the advent of such support, they had </p>

<p> been able to expand or increase numerous aspects of their </p>

<p> programs, including=20 </p>

<p> o number of grade levels with </p>

<p> substance abuse curricula, </p>

<p> o school-wide emphasis on substance </p>

<p> abuse prevention,=20 </p>

<p> o number of teachers and staff </p>

<p> involved, and=20 </p>

<p> o number of students involved. =20 </p>

<p> A total of 25% of these districts had increased their </p>

<p> curriculum development activities, and 48% had increased </p>

<p> their degree of involvement with other groups in the </p>

<p> community. The availability of DFSCA funds may be more </p>

<p> limited in the future. </p>

<p> Drug Use Prevention Strategies </p>

<p> A variety of school-based intervention programs </p>

<p> have been developed over the past three decades for </p>

<p> preventing drug use among youth (Botvin, 1990; Flay, </p>

<p> 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, Malvin, Schaeffer, &amp; </p>

<p> Schaps, 1983; Tobler, 1986). The types of programs </p>

<p> differ both in terms of what they teach as well as in how </p>

<p> they are taught (Tobler, in press, 1994). Program </p>

<p> content generally reflects assumptions about why young </p>

<p> people use drugs. For example, activities to boost self- </p>

<p> esteem reflect the belief that low self-esteem is a risk </p>

<p> factor for drug use; strategies that teach youth how to </p>

<p> refuse offers of drugs from friends assume that peer </p>

<p> pressure leads to drug use. Similarly, teaching methods </p>

<p> implemented in various strategies reflect beliefs about </p>

<p> the most effective means for teaching young people not to </p>

<p> use drugs. Programs that use didactic methods reflect a </p>

<p> traditional expert model for learning; programs that </p>

<p> emphasize group activities reflect the belief that </p>

<p> participatory activities enhance understanding and </p>

<p> learning more effectively. </p>

<p> Although hundreds of individual school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs have been developed, they generally </p>

<p> fall into three broad categories:=20 </p>

<p> (a) knowledge/information programs, (b) affective </p>

<p> programs, and (c) social influences programs. A fourth </p>

<p> category of prevention programs, alternative programs, </p>

<p> includes those usually offered outside the school </p>

<p> setting. Knowledge/information and affective education </p>

<p> programs have sometimes been grouped together as more </p>

<p> traditional approaches, while social influences programs </p>

<p> represent newer approaches (Bruvold, 1993; Tobler, in </p>

<p> press, 1994). These three types of programs tend to </p>

<p> differ in content, in methods, and in their </p>

<p> effectiveness. Even so, there is overlap among them. </p>

<p> Knowledge/information programs were the earliest </p>

<p> school-based prevention efforts to be developed. These </p>

<p> strategies are based on the assumption that youth begin </p>

<p> using drugs because they are not sufficiently </p>

<p> knowledgeable about adverse consequences. Once youth </p>

<p> have adequate and accurate knowledge about drugs, it is </p>

<p> assumed that they will behave rationally and choose not </p>

<p> to use drugs. It is also assumed that changes in </p>

<p> knowledge about drugs will promote more negative </p>

<p> attitudes toward drug use, which in turn will be a </p>

<p> deterrent to using drugs. Knowledge programs typically </p>

<p> present factual information about the legal, biological, </p>

<p> and psychological effects of drug use. Some of these </p>

<p> programs have adopted scare tactics to present the risks </p>

<p> of drug use to youth in a dramatic fashion. The methods </p>

<p> used by knowledge/information programs typically include </p>

<p> didactic presentations, discussion, and audiovisual </p>

<p> presentations. </p>

<p> Affective programs were developed in the late 1970s </p>

<p> and early 1980s and are based on the assumption that </p>

<p> young people use drugs because of personal and social </p>

<p> deficits. These programs emphasize increasing self- </p>

<p> esteem, enhancing self-awareness, clarifying values, </p>

<p> making responsible decisions, and improving interpersonal </p>

<p> skills. Affective programs often do not mention drug use </p>

<p> at all. By enriching personal and social development, it </p>

<p> is assumed that youth will make responsible decisions </p>

<p> about drug use. These programs typically are taught by </p>

<p> the same types of methods as for knowledge/ information </p>

<p> programs, but they also may include group activities. </p>

<p> Social influences programs are the most recent </p>

<p> approach to drug use among youth. These programs are </p>

<p> based on the assumption that youth use drugs because they </p>

<p> do not have the social competencies needed to resist </p>

<p> social pressures to use drugs. Some programs focus </p>

<p> specifically on teaching youth the skills needed for </p>

<p> resisting drug use influences. Other programs emphasize </p>

<p> developing more general social competencies, such as </p>

<p> increasing decisionmaking, improving communication, and </p>

<p> reducing anxiety, in addition to enhancing drug-specific </p>

<p> social skills. They may also include activities to </p>

<p> correct misperceptions about the prevalence and </p>

<p> acceptability of drug use among peers, as well as </p>

<p> activities that seek to establish conservative group </p>

<p> norms about drug use. Social influences programs </p>

<p> typically include active, participatory learning </p>

<p> experiences, such as modeling, role-playing, and </p>

<p> practicing behavioral skills. Social influence </p>

<p> strategies also frequently and actively involve &quot;peers </p>

<p> leaders&quot; as teachers, in role-playing, or to facilitate </p>

<p> discussion. </p>

<p> Despite the differences across program categories, </p>

<p> there is actually much overlap among school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs in their components. Affective </p>

<p> programs share similarities with some social influences </p>

<p> programs in their emphasis, for example, on developing </p>

<p> personal competencies. Social influences programs </p>

<p> frequently include information about drugs and adverse </p>

<p> consequences. Some programs include elements of all </p>

<p> three categories of programs and have been labeled </p>

<p> comprehensive programs. Indeed, many school-based </p>

<p> curricula, including D.A.R.E., combine strategies that </p>

<p> reflect knowledge/information, affective, and social </p>

<p> influences programs. </p>

<p> Research on the effectiveness of school-based </p>

<p> prevention programs suggests that all three program </p>

<p> strategies are not equally successful in preventing </p>

<p> adolescent drug use (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold, 1993; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Knowledge/information </p>

<p> programs generally have not been effective in preventing </p>

<p> drug use among youth. The evidence suggests that, </p>

<p> although information-based programs may increase </p>

<p> students' knowledge of drugs, they are unlikely to result </p>

<p> in positive changes in either attitudes or behavior. In </p>

<p> fact, some research indicates that these programs may </p>

<p> lead to undesirable changes in attitudes (Bruvold &amp; </p>

<p> Rundall, 1988). Affective strategies also have not </p>

<p> performed well in previous evaluations and meta-analyses </p>

<p> (Botvin, 1990; Tobler, 1986). For example, Hansen, </p>

<p> Johnson, Flay, Graham, and Sobel (1988) found that </p>

<p> students who received an affective education program </p>

<p> reported significantly more drug use than students in a </p>

<p> comparison group and that these differences increased </p>

<p> over time. In contrast, the results of evaluation of </p>

<p> social influences programs have been generally more </p>

<p> positive (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993, 1986; Bruvold &amp; </p>

<p> Rundall, 1988; Flay, 1985; Hansen, 1992; Moskowitz, 1989; </p>

<p> Pentz et al., 1989; Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). In </p>

<p> comparison with knowledge/information and affective </p>

<p> programs, social influences programs have been more </p>

<p> effective at preventing adolescent drug use. </p>

<p> History of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a school-based drug prevention program </p>

<p> designed to prevent students' use of tobacco, alcohol, </p>

<p> and other drugs. Most D.A.R.E. activities are directed </p>

<p> toward pupils in the last grade of elementary school </p>

<p> (grade 5 or 6), which is thought to be the age at which </p>

<p> youth are most receptive to an anti-drug message, and </p>

<p> before they begin experimenting with drugs (Bureau of </p>

<p> Justice Assistance [BJA], 1991b). The original D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, which was implemented in 1983, was </p>

<p> developed by Dr. Ruth Rich, health education specialist </p>

<p> from the LAUSD. Dr. Rich based the D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum on a review of other prevalent drug prevention </p>

<p> programs, particularly Project SMART (Self-Management and </p>

<p> Resistance Training), a prevention program designed by </p>

<p> the Health Behavior Research Institute of the University </p>

<p> of Southern California. =20 </p>

<p> From its inception, D.A.R.E. was designed to be a </p>

<p> continuing education program for kindergarten through </p>

<p> high school. To that end, junior high and senior high </p>

<p> curricula were developed in 1986 and 1988, respectively.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, D.A.R.E. designers created a parent </p>

<p> curriculum to teach parents how to recognize and prevent </p>

<p> drug use among youth and to provide them with information </p>

<p> about the program. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is distinctive among school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention programs in that it uses trained, uniformed </p>

<p> police officers in the classroom to teach a highly </p>

<p> structured curriculum. D.A.R.E. officers enter the </p>

<p> classroom not only because of a cooperative agreement </p>

<p> between the local school district and law enforcement </p>

<p> agency, but also because the community is willing to </p>

<p> forgo or replace the time that D.A.R.E. officers lose to </p>

<p> other police duties. During D.A.R.E.'s first year, 1983- </p>

<p> 1984, 10 officers taught the curriculum to around 8,000 </p>

<p> students in 50 Los Angeles elementary schools (BJA, </p>

<p> 1991a). D.A.R.E. is now widely implemented throughout </p>

<p> the Nation and parts of Europe and Asia. According to </p>

<p> the BJA (1991b), some 6 million students in the United </p>

<p> States received D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year, </p>

<p> and D.A.R.E. is currently implemented in 8,000 cities </p>

<p> across the Nation (Glenn Levant, personal communication).=20 </p>

<p> Indeed, the D.A.R.E. workbooks are currently available in </p>

<p> Japanese, Vietnamese, Spanish, and Braille. In addition, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. has been adopted by several governmental </p>

<p> agencies that sponsor schools, including the Department </p>

<p> of the Interior, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the </p>

<p> Capitol police, the National Park Service, and all </p>

<p> overseas branches of the Department of Defense. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. combines an essentially local, grass-roots </p>

<p> effort with a high degree of centralized program control </p>

<p> asserted by coordinating mechanisms at the national, </p>

<p> regional, and State levels. At the national level, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America assumes the primary responsibility for </p>

<p> implementing and managing D.A.R.E., assisted by five RTCs </p>

<p> that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board.=20 </p>

<p> A detailed examination of the roles of national, </p>

<p> regional, and State D.A.R.E. organizations is presented </p>

<p> in Section II, Chapter 3.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Curricula </p>

<p> The primary purposes of all the D.A.R.E. curricula </p>

<p> for students are to </p>

<p> o teach students to recognize pressures </p>

<p> to use drugs from peers and from the </p>

<p> media, </p>

<p> o teach students the skills to resist </p>

<p> peer inducements to use drugs, </p>

<p> o enhance students' self-esteem,=20 </p>

<p> o teach positive alternatives to </p>

<p> substance use, and </p>

<p> o increase students' interpersonal, </p>

<p> communication, and decision-making </p>

<p> skills (BJA, 1991a). </p>

<p> Each of the curricula is periodically updated; an updated </p>

<p> version of the core curriculum is currently being pilot </p>

<p> tested and will be implemented in September 1994. A </p>

<p> brief summary of each of the five D.A.R.E. curricula </p>

<p> follows. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. core curriculum, which is taught in </p>

<p> the 5th or 6th grade, comprises </p>

<p> 17 hour-long weekly lessons. The D.A.R.E. officers have </p>

<p> sole responsibility for teaching all of the lessons, </p>

<p> although classroom teachers are encouraged to </p>

<p> participate. Officers use a variety of teaching </p>

<p> approaches, including the presentation of facts, group </p>

<p> discussions, role-playing, and workbook exercises. =20 </p>

<p> The core curriculum was updated in 1993 and will be </p>

<p> fully implemented in 1994. The updated curriculum </p>

<p> differs from the previous version in a variety of ways.=20 </p>

<p> The new curriculum, which has been renamed &quot;D.A.R.E. to </p>

<p> Resist Drugs and Violence,&quot; </p>

<p> o includes specific lessons concerning </p>

<p> tobacco and inhalants, </p>

<p> o emphasizes normative beliefs and </p>

<p> protective factors, </p>

<p> o adds violence prevention/conflict </p>

<p> resolution strategies, </p>

<p> o uses more participatory learning </p>

<p> activities, and </p>

<p> o employs a more collaborative </p>

<p> partnership between the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer and the teacher in the </p>

<p> classroom (Charles Dunn, personal </p>

<p> communication, June 22, 1993). </p>

<p> In both the old and new versions of the core curriculum, </p>

<p> the lessons are cumulative, building upon concepts </p>

<p> introduced in previous lessons. With the exception of </p>

<p> lesson 14 in both versions, the lessons are implemented </p>

<p> in sequence and without variation. </p>

<p> The data collection for the implementation </p>

<p> assessment and the evaluations studied in the outcome </p>

<p> assessment occurred before the introduction of the new </p>

<p> curriculum. We, therefore, believe it is important to </p>

<p> provide information on both versions. Exhibit 2.1 </p>

<p> presents a summary of the original version of the core </p>

<p> curriculum upon which the outcome evaluation was based, </p>

<p> and Exhibit 2.2 displays a summary of the updated </p>

<p> curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> In elementary schools that receive the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, officers may also visit students in </p>

<p> kindergarten through 4th grade to teach brief </p>

<p> introductory (15- to 20- minute) lessons. Topics in this </p>

<p> curriculum include personal safety, the consequences of </p>

<p> taking medicine and using drugs, saying &quot;no&quot; when
asked </p>

<p> to engage in antisocial activities, and learning about </p>

<p> feelings. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. junior high school curriculum was </p>

<p> originally developed to provide or </p>

<p> reinforce information and skills that help students </p>

<p> resist pressure to use drugs. Revisions were made in </p>

<p> 1989 to include violence reduction, conflict resolution, </p>

<p> and anger management. The 10 lessons are taught </p>

<p> cooperatively by the officer and the classroom teacher.=20 </p>

<p> The lessons and activities (summarized in Exhibit 2.3) </p>

<p> are implemented over a 10-day period as part of a </p>

<p> required course, such as health, science, or social </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> The senior high school curriculum also focuses on </p>

<p> drug abuse and its effect on communities and young people </p>

<p> (see Exhibit 2.4 for a summary of the lessons). The </p>

<p> senior high school curriculum was designed to be taught </p>

<p> over an 11-day period during health or another </p>

<p> appropriate class. Responsibility for teaching the </p>

<p> lessons is divided between the officer and the classroom </p>

<p> teacher. Officers and teachers are trained together and </p>

<p> are encouraged to be present during the entire 11-day </p>

<p> period. </p>

<p> Because of the difficulties educators have </p>

<p> continually faced persuading parents to attend school </p>

<p> educational functions, the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum was </p>

<p> designed to be </p>

<p> implemented where parents live and work. This curriculum </p>

<p> consists of four or five 2-hour Exhibit 2.1 D.A.R.E.'s

<p> resources and </p>

<p> referrals </p>

<p> sessions generally held in the evenings (see Exhibit 2.5 </p>

<p> for a summary of these lessons). Topics covered in this </p>

<p> curriculum include developing better skills to interact </p>

<p> with children, learning about peer pressures, and </p>

<p> identifying signs and reducing risks of potential </p>

<p> substance abuse. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Officers and Training </p>

<p> Law enforcement agencies exercise considerable </p>

<p> discretion in identifying qualified, motivated police </p>

<p> officers to be trained as D.A.R.E. officers. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers must be full-time, uniformed officers with at </p>

<p> least 2 years of experience. When selecting candidate </p>

<p> officers, local police departments are encouraged to </p>

<p> consider the officer's ability to interact with children, </p>

<p> ability to organize, and ability to handle the </p>

<p> unexpected, as well as whether the officer would provide </p>

<p> an exemplary role model and refrain from sexual, racial, </p>

<p> stereotypical, or inappropriate remarks (BJA, 1991b). =20 </p>

<p> Selected officers undergo an intensive, 2-week </p>

<p> course of at least 80 hours of training. Officers are </p>

<p> trained not only in the core curriculum, but also in </p>

<p> public speaking, teaching skills, and classroom </p>

<p> management. Their performance is directly critiqued by </p>

<p> assigned mentors, who are experienced and specially </p>

<p> trained D.A.R.E. officers. Outside speakers and </p>

<p> consultants are also used to instruct the officers in </p>

<p> areas requiring special expertise (e.g., a psychologist </p>

<p> may present information on the stages of child </p>

<p> development). The core curriculum training course </p>

<p> includes opportunities to practice lessons both with </p>

<p> peers and in an actual classroom setting. =20 </p>

<p> Additional training is provided for officers </p>

<p> teaching the junior and senior high school and parent </p>

<p> curricula. Officers teaching these curricula are </p>

<p> required to be certified as a D.A.R.E. officer and to </p>

<p> have taught the core curriculum at least two semesters.=20 </p>

<p> In-service training is provided to review what officers </p>

<p> have previously learned in light of their actual </p>

<p> classroom experiences and to acquaint them with changes </p>

<p> to the curricula. The time that D.A.R.E. officers commit </p>

<p> to the program varies considerably from one law </p>

<p> enforcement jurisdiction to the next. For some officers, </p>

<p> particularly those in large urban departments, teaching </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a full-time occupation. In departments that </p>

<p> serve rural communities, D.A.R.E. officers administer the </p>

<p> program on a part-time basis, devoting the remainder of </p>

<p> their time to other law enforcement tasks. =20 </p>

<p> Once in the field, D.A.R.E. officer performance is </p>

<p> monitored by mentors who observe classroom presentations </p>

<p> and evaluate performance. Mentors may also use input </p>

<p> from school administrators, classroom teachers, health </p>

<p> education coordinators, and advisory committees to </p>

<p> provide officers with feedback on their presentations. =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in the Context of Other School-Based Drug Use </p>

<p> Prevention Programs </p>

<p> Considering that the D.A.R.E. curricula were based </p>

<p> on several preexisting school-based drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula (primarily Project SMART), it is not surprising </p>

<p> that the curricula closely resemble other programs in </p>

<p> content. Exhibit 2.6 show that D.A.R.E.'s core </p>

<p> curriculum includes lessons that represent all three </p>

<p> curricular strategies discussed earlier.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. differs from most other school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention programs in the structure by which it is </p>

<p> organized and implemented. First, D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> implemented by law enforcement officers; most other </p>

<p> programs are taught by teachers. Second, D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer training lasts 2 weeks and is highly intensive; </p>

<p> most drug prevention program training for teachers is of </p>

<p> a shorter duration. Third, D.A.R.E. officers are </p>

<p> strongly encouraged to deliver their lessons in sequence, </p>

<p> departing only minimally (if at all) from their lesson </p>

<p> plans; teachers are much more free to adapt curricula at </p>

<p> will, emphasizing those areas they believe to be most </p>

<p> salient or useful or integrating the drug prevention </p>

<p> material into their general education curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> Fourth, D.A.R.E. officer performance is often carefully </p>

<p> monitored and evaluated; generally, the accountability </p>

<p> mechanisms for teachers' implementation of their </p>

<p> curricula are less structured. Fifth, the mission of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers in the school is exclusively drug </p>

<p> prevention; to most teachers, drug prevention is often </p>

<p> only part of a larger curriculum. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 3 </p>

<p> NATIONAL AND REGIONAL OPERATIONS </p>

<p> In any consideration of the organization of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. at the national and regional levels, it is </p>

<p> important to remember that D.A.R.E. is very much a grass- </p>

<p> roots program. In essence, it is a product of memoranda </p>

<p> of understanding between community law enforcement and </p>

<p> local public school districts across the Nation. The </p>

<p> primary purposes of the D.A.R.E. hierarchy described in </p>

<p> this chapter are to ensure the integrity of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum and the fidelity with which it is delivered; </p>

<p> to develop and uphold standards for the integrity, </p>

<p> coordination, and quality of D.A.R.E. operations; and to </p>

<p> provide support to D.A.R.E. at the community level. </p>

<p> As we have said, in its degree of organization at </p>

<p> the national and regional levels, D.A.R.E. differs </p>

<p> greatly from other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, most of which limit their activities to </p>

<p> delivering packaged curricula to school districts and </p>

<p> offering some level of training to teachers. In </p>

<p> contrast, the D.A.R.E. organization oversees all aspects </p>

<p> of the prevention program, including the consistency with </p>

<p> which it is implemented in the classroom. In this </p>

<p> chapter, we discuss the functions of D.A.R.E. America, </p>

<p> the preeminent D.A.R.E. organization, and its </p>

<p> relationship with the </p>

<p> o D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board; </p>

<p> o State Training Centers, State Charter </p>

<p> Organizations; and State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Coordinators; </p>

<p> o Los Angeles United School District </p>

<p> (LAUSD); and </p>

<p> o D.A.R.E. America Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Board. </p>

<p> We obtained much of the information for this chapter from </p>

<p> an interview conducted in August 1994 with Glenn Levant, </p>

<p> Executive Director of D.A.R.E. America. This information </p>

<p> is supplemented by relevant D.A.R.E. documents. We also </p>

<p> summarize a series of loosely structured interviews </p>

<p> conducted in 1992 with representatives of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. at the national, regional, State, and </p>

<p> local levels is promoted, monitored, and overseen by </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America, which is chartered as a nonprofit </p>

<p> organization. As specified in its charter, D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America has responsibility for a variety of key func- </p>

<p> tions, including </p>

<p> o administering the D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> o providing educational materials to </p>

<p> communities implementing D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> o overseeing D.A.R.E. officer training </p>

<p> and ensuring its consistency, </p>

<p> o improving the curriculum, and </p>

<p> o providing support to D.A.R.E. both </p>

<p> nationally and internationally. =20 </p>

<p> In 1988, the BJA awarded four grants to establish </p>

<p> the RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board, and a fifth RTC was established the </p>

<p> following year. The RTCs are located in Arizona, </p>

<p> California, Illinois, Virginia, and North Carolina, and </p>

<p> the States associated with each are presented in Exhibit </p>

<p> 3.1. The responsibilities of the RTCs include making </p>

<p> recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning the </p>

<p> accreditation of State-level training centers. In </p>

<p> addition, the RTCs provide oversight to the local </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs to ensure that the copyrighted </p>

<p> curriculum is taught as specified. Educational </p>

<p> specialists representing the five RTCs, together with </p>

<p> staff of the LAUSD, are charged with curricular </p>

<p> development, taking advice from the Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Board and other specialists. In Federal FY 1994, it is </p>

<p> expected that the BJA grant, which in the past has flowed </p>

<p> to the RTCs, will come directly to D.A.R.E. America to </p>

<p> support the RTCs. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is also organized at the State level. In </p>

<p> more than one-third of the States, D.A.R.E. America has </p>

<p> helped charter a nonprofit (501C3) organization, over </p>

<p> which D.A.R.E. America has oversight, and which is </p>

<p> designed to support the program in that State. The board </p>

<p> of the chartered organization typically comprises the </p>

<p> State's attorney general, the superintendent of </p>

<p> education, and prominent business and education people.=20 </p>

<p> The board of directors may also include a representative </p>

<p> of the State's D.A.R.E. Officers' Association (described </p>

<p> below) as well as, in some States, a D.A.R.E. coordinator </p>

<p> whose prominence and position may vary considerably. It </p>

<p> is expected that in time there will be D.A.R.E. charter </p>

<p> organizations in the remaining States. In those States </p>

<p> that currently lack a charter organization, there is </p>

<p> typically some individual identified as the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinator who often is a State employee. This </p>

<p> person's responsibilities include coordinating candidate </p>

<p> selection and scheduling training for D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> obtaining State funds to support D.A.R.E. programs, </p>

<p> providing local technical assistance, and overseeing </p>

<p> policy development and implementation at the State level.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America meets with these individuals, and with </p>

<p> the State charter organizations, on a quarterly basis. </p>

<p> In addition to D.A.R.E. State charter organizations </p>

<p> at the State level, a total of 42 States currently have </p>

<p> developed State Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of </p>

<p> which is to conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers. These centers are differentially accredited; </p>

<p> all conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers in </p>

<p> the core curriculum, while only some are accredited to </p>

<p> teach the other curricula or to train D.A.R.E. mentors.=20 </p>

<p> The STCs are supported both by the States and by D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America. The level of activity of these centers varies </p>

<p> considerably given the size of the State and demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer training. At present, there are some </p>

<p> 20,000 certified D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America also owns and protects the </p>

<p> copyright to the D.A.R.E. name, logo, and associated </p>

<p> slogans. D.A.R.E.'s name is considered a valuable </p>

<p> intellectual property. D.A.R.E. America approves all </p>

<p> materials (e.g., bumper stickers) and celebrities used to </p>

<p> promote the D.A.R.E. program. In addition, the </p>

<p> organization screens sponsors for fund-raising events to </p>

<p> exclude companies manufacturing alcohol or tobacco </p>

<p> products. =20 </p>

<p> Together with the LAUSD, D.A.R.E. America owns the </p>

<p> copyright to the core curriculum. The superintendent of </p>

<p> the LAUSD has been represented on the board of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America since 1983. Through the RTCs, D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> monitors the implementation of D.A.R.E. in each community </p>

<p> and may withdraw its permission to use D.A.R.E. if a </p>

<p> local school district has improperly modified the </p>

<p> curriculum. To fulfill its responsibility of improving </p>

<p> the curriculum, D.A.R.E. America established in 1993 a </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Board, which is chaired by Dr. Herb </p>

<p> Kleber of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse </p>

<p> (CASA) at Columbia University. Dr. Kleber was formally </p>

<p> the chief official for demand reduction in the Bush </p>

<p> Administration's White House Office of National Drug </p>

<p> Control Policy (ONDCP). The board includes prevention </p>

<p> specialists from across the Nation. </p>

<p> The National D.A.R.E. Officers' Association, which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America helped to found in 1987, serves to </p>

<p> improve communications among police officers within </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. The association now has a State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Officers' association in each of the 50 States. Each of </p>

<p> the 18 other countries that have adopted the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program also has an association of D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> although those association are not formally a part of the </p>

<p> national association. However, all associations, both </p>

<p> domestic and foreign, look to D.A.R.E. America for </p>

<p> guidance in matters of policy. </p>

<p> Finally, D.A.R.E. America provides considerable </p>

<p> support to communities implementing D.A.R.E. in the form </p>

<p> of the educational materials that support the curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> In some cases, D.A.R.E. America offers communities direct </p>

<p> financial support as well. </p>

<p> We collected further information by means of </p>

<p> informal interviews and discussions we conducted with the </p>

<p> coordinators and/or educational advisors of each of the </p>

<p> five RTCs in January 1992. The RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> discussed with us a number of their needs and </p>

<p> recommendations for the D.A.R.E. program. Summaries of </p>

<p> their discussions with us are presented below. </p>

<p> An increasing need for in-service training. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors indicated that a substantial number </p>

<p> of officers have received D.A.R.E. training in the past </p>

<p> decade. However, they stressed that the original </p>

<p> training of many officers may now be several years old.=20 </p>

<p> RTC coordinators/advisors indicated that although </p>

<p> mechanisms for providing in-service training do exist, </p>

<p> these mechanisms may not be sufficient. Furthermore, </p>

<p> they suggested that because training of new officers </p>

<p> already stretches available resources, the increasing </p>

<p> need for in-service training for existing D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers will strain D.A.R.E.'s budget further.=20 </p>

<p> The increasing need to train State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors indicated that most States now have State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators (see Chapter 4). However, they </p>

<p> reported that many are relatively new in these positions </p>

<p> or have received little formal information about how to </p>

<p> conduct their jobs. They stated that coordinator </p>

<p> training should include the responsibilities and roles of </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators, as well as how they can </p>

<p> effectively interact both with their RTC and the schools </p>

<p> in their States. RTC coordinators/advisors reported that </p>

<p> plans are currently under way to establish procedures to </p>

<p> accredit State D.A.R.E. coordinators. =20 </p>

<p> The need to improve lines of communication and </p>

<p> clarify lines of authority. RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> indicated that because of the lack of formal training and </p>

<p> the lack of communication among State coordinators, many </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators have had to learn their jobs </p>

<p> by trial and error. They stated that although a certain </p>

<p> amount of communication occurs among State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators (especially among coordinators in </p>

<p> neighboring States), increasing communication would </p>

<p> greatly enhance efficiency by enabling coordinators to </p>

<p> draw on the experiences of others instead of
&quot;reinventing </p>

<p> the wheel.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> RTC coordinators/advisors also indicated that State </p>

<p> coordinators may need assistance with getting local </p>

<p> programs to recognize developing lines of authority. For </p>

<p> example, they stated that in the past, local programs </p>

<p> worked directly with RTCs; they said that many local </p>

<p> programs will need to be prompted to now work with the </p>

<p> STC instead. </p>

<p> The need for increased D.A.R.E. officer mentoring.=20 </p>

<p> At present, RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors reported that there is a well-developed system </p>

<p> for monitoring D.A.R.E. officer performance in the </p>

<p> classroom. They reported that D.A.R.E. mentors </p>

<p> periodically monitor and evaluate officer performance by </p>

<p> observing classes taught by the officer. They also </p>

<p> indicated that teachers are given the opportunity to rate </p>

<p> officer performance. They reported that D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers are informed of any problem areas, told how to </p>

<p> correct these problems, and later reevaluated to ensure </p>

<p> that the problem has been corrected. However, to be </p>

<p> truly useful, RTC coordinators reported that these </p>

<p> mentors should have the time and resources necessary to </p>

<p> work closely with D.A.R.E. officers to improve their </p>

<p> performance. </p>

<p> The need for increased collaboration between </p>

<p> education and law enforcement. RTC coordinators/advisors </p>

<p> indicated that because D.A.R.E. was created as a close </p>

<p> partnership between the LAUSD and the Los Angeles Police </p>

<p> Department, the program is dependent on a strong and </p>

<p> continuing relationship between education and law </p>

<p> enforcement at every level. </p>

<p> At the State level, RTC coordinators/advisors see </p>

<p> close collaboration between the department of education </p>

<p> and the organization administering D.A.R.E. (typically </p>

<p> related to law enforcement) as essential. They indicated </p>

<p> that the institutional commitment of State Departments of </p>

<p> Education to D.A.R.E. is essential, in part, to help </p>

<p> resolve any community-level problems. Further, they </p>

<p> indicated that as administrators of DFSCA funds, State </p>

<p> Departments of Education have an increasing role to play </p>

<p> in providing guidance concerning the various components </p>

<p> of a school district's comprehensive K-12 curriculum </p>

<p> (including D.A.R.E.) and how these components should be </p>

<p> integrated to ensure a comprehensive approach. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators indicated that ways in which State </p>

<p> Departments of Education could play a role in assisting </p>

<p> with the evaluation of D.A.R.E. officer performance </p>

<p> should be examined. </p>

<p> At the local level, RTC coordinators indicated that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is initiated when a school district invites a </p>

<p> police department to teach the program. They reported </p>

<p> that the police department nominates a candidate for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer training, and the candidate must be </p>

<p> acceptable to the school district administration. In the </p>

<p> classroom, they stated, the role of the teacher is </p>

<p> evolving from an observer and monitor of the officer's </p>

<p> performance to an active partner in D.A.R.E. instruction.=20 </p>

<p> The need to maintain limits to the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> &quot;bureaucracy&quot;. RTC coordinators/ </p>

<p> advisors stressed that pressures on D.A.R.E. to expand </p>

<p> its operations are considerable. They indicated that as </p>

<p> an institution, D.A.R.E. remains committed to maintaining </p>

<p> high standards at the community level. They reported </p>

<p> that as the role of the State coordinator continues to </p>

<p> become more important in this regard, the need for the </p>

<p> RTCs to provide technical assistance and to monitor State </p>

<p> activities becomes even more crucial. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors reported that because existing RTC </p>

<p> resources are already strained by current demands, </p>

<p> further growth at the national level seems inevitable.=20 </p>

<p> They indicated that even if support for such growth </p>

<p> exists, however, there is concern that a bureaucracy will </p>

<p> develop that may weaken the &quot;grass-roots&quot; nature of
the </p>

<p> enterprise. Coordinators/advisors indicated that it will </p>

<p> be a challenge to increase the size and capabilities of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. bureaucracy to manage and control this </p>

<p> burgeoning program with the need to keep the bureaucracy </p>

<p> streamlined and responsive to the needs of the </p>

<p> communities that D.A.R.E. serves. </p>

<p> The need to locate permanent funding sources. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors indicated that D.A.R.E. currently </p>

<p> receives substantial support from DFSCA. However, they </p>

<p> feel that Federal DFSCA funds appear to have reached a </p>

<p> plateau in the past 3 years and are likely to be </p>

<p> subjected to budget cuts in the future. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators/advisors fear that D.A.R.E. could be reduced </p>

<p> or even eliminated as a line item. Regardless, they </p>

<p> reported that Federal funding may have been a mixed </p>

<p> blessing, insofar as Federal support may displace local </p>

<p> efforts to secure the resources necessary to implement </p>

<p> the program.=20 </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> In this chapter, we focused on the national- and </p>

<p> regional-level operations of D.A.R.E. We conducted </p>

<p> unstructured interviews with the executive director of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America and representatives from each of the </p>

<p> RTCs. We also reviewed available documents. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is a grass-roots program that operates </p>

<p> through memoranda of understanding between community law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies and local schools. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America, a nonprofit organization, coordinates, promotes, </p>

<p> monitors, and assumes ultimate responsibility for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program at all levels. The D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board, which is composed of staff from the RTCs, </p>

<p> serves in an advisory capacity to D.A.R.E. America. In </p>

<p> addition to making recommendations to D.A.R.E. America, </p>

<p> RTCs are responsible for oversight of the local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs and coordinating and conducting D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> training. Organizations and individuals working to </p>

<p> promote and coordinate the D.A.R.E. program at the State </p>

<p> levelinclude State-chartered nonprofit organizations, State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers' associations, and State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. Also at the State level are STCs that </p>

<p> provide training to D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> Curriculum development and changes are the </p>

<p> responsibility of educational specialists from each of </p>

<p> the RTCs, together with staff from the LAUSD. A </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Board, composed of leading prevention </p>

<p> specialists, assists in these endeavors. </p>

<p> Our interviews with the RTC coordinators indicated </p>

<p> the following key issues: a need for increased in- </p>

<p> service training and mentoring, providing training to </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. coordinators, improving communication and </p>

<p> collaboration between agencies, maintaining limits on the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. bureaucracy, and locating permanent funding </p>

<p> sources. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 4 </p>

<p> STATE-LEVEL OPERATIONS </p>

<p> In this chapter, we present the second component of </p>

<p> the implementation assessment, a survey of those </p>

<p> individuals who generally manage the State-level D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> operations: the State D.A.R.E. coordinators. This </p>

<p> component was conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for </p>

<p> information concerning: </p>

<p> o features common to most D.A.R.E. programs, </p>

<p> o funding arrangements for D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> o management of D.A.R.E. and supporting </p>

<p> organizations, and </p>

<p> o availability of the D.A.R.E. curricula. </p>

<p> The primary objective of this component was, of course, </p>

<p> to provide information concerning D.A.R.E.'s State-level </p>

<p> operations. As a secondary objective, we collected </p>

<p> preliminary information to facilitate sample selection </p>

<p> for the school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> survey, the results of which we present in Chapter 5. </p>

<p> This chapter covers both the methodology for and </p>

<p> findings from the survey of State D.A.R.E. coordinators.=20 </p>

<p> The findings section presents data concerning the </p>

<p> administration, funding, implementation, challenges, and </p>

<p> problems of State-level D.A.R.E. operations. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Instrument Design </p>

<p> We based the content of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators' survey on the research issues raised in </p>

<p> NIJ's solicitation, discussions with NIJ personnel, a </p>

<p> review of the literature on D.A.R.E.'s structure and </p>

<p> operations, and an examination of prior studies of </p>

<p> school-based drug education conducted at RTI.=20 </p>

<p> Recognizing that State D.A.R.E. coordinators have </p>

<p> considerable demands on their time, we designed the </p>

<p> instrument to be as brief and straightforward as </p>

<p> possible. To minimize ambiguity and burden, we used </p>

<p> mostly close-ended items. A few open-ended questions </p>

<p> were included to encourage respondents to provide </p>

<p> detailed information. =20 </p>

<p> The survey instrument was composed of two parts: a </p>

<p> questionnaire and a list of school districts. The </p>

<p> questionnaire contained items concerning administration, </p>

<p> funding, and implementation of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. The list of school districts contained those </p>

<p> districts we selected from that State for the first-phase </p>

<p> sample of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators' survey (see Chapter 5). We asked State </p>

<p> coordinators to indicate whether each district on their </p>

<p> list used D.A.R.E., and we then used this information to </p>

<p> draw the second-phase sample for the school district </p>

<p> survey. </p>

<p> We pretested the instrument on three State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators in early February 1992. We also shared the </p>

<p> instrument with all five RTC coordinators and requested </p>

<p> their feedback. We incorporated the responses of pretest </p>

<p> participants, as well the comments of the RTC </p>

<p> coordinators, the NIJ program manager, and other alcohol </p>

<p> and drug prevention program experts into the final draft </p>

<p> of the data collection instrument. A copy of the survey </p>

<p> instrument and other data collection materials can be </p>

<p> found in Appendix D. </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> In January 1992, the RTC coordinators provided us </p>

<p> with lists of names and addresses of State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators. Based on this information, we identified </p>

<p> 44 States with D.A.R.E. coordinators. We mailed each </p>

<p> coordinator a package containing cover letters from the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board and RTI, a </p>

<p> questionnaire, and a list of school districts in the </p>

<p> coordinator's State. The cover letter from the RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board expressed support for the research effort </p>

<p> and encouraged participation. The cover letter from RTI </p>

<p> explained the study, provided assurances that all </p>

<p> information would be kept strictly confidential, and </p>

<p> requested copies of any pertinent State documents </p>

<p> concerning the organization and/or administration of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. =20 </p>

<p> We mailed the packages to the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators on February 18, 1992. Two weeks after the </p>

<p> initial mailout, we contacted nonresponders by telephone.=20 </p>

<p> We made repeated attempts by mail and telephone to secure </p>

<p> the return of completed materials or to collect the </p>

<p> information by phone. The RTCs were again of great </p>

<p> assistance to us in urging coordinators to return </p>

<p> surveys. </p>

<p> Of the 44 respondents identified by the RTC </p>

<p> coordinators, 39 completed the instrument. For purposes </p>

<p> of verification, one question in the survey asked </p>

<p> respondents to confirm that the State had a D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator. Although four States responded that they </p>

<p> did not have such a position, we determined after some </p>

<p> investigation that they did have a person who performs a </p>

<p> coordinator's role. Respondents from all four of these </p>

<p> States reported that administration of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program was one of several roles they performed as </p>

<p> supervisors or directors in law enforcement agencies.=20 </p>

<p> We, therefore, did not delete these responses from our </p>

<p> analysis. It should be noted, however, that because of </p>

<p> skip patterns in the survey instrument, these four </p>

<p> respondents did not complete survey items specifically </p>

<p> directed to the State D.A.R.E. coordinator. =20 </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> Administration </p>

<p> To address issues raised in the NIJ solicitation </p>

<p> concerning management of the D.A.R.E. program, we asked a </p>

<p> series of questions about the agencies involved in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s administration at the State level, the </p>

<p> functions of each agency, and the relationships among </p>

<p> them. Findings from these questions are presented below. </p>

<p> Agencies Involved. We first asked respondents to </p>

<p> report the agency with primary responsibility for </p>

<p> managing the State D.A.R.E. program. As shown in Exhibit </p>

<p> 4.1, the great majority of States indicated that a law </p>

<p> enforcement or criminal justice agency was entrusted with </p>

<p> this responsibility. =20 </p>

<p> States are encouraged to establish statewide boards </p>

<p> that will help ensure that the State D.A.R.E. program </p>

<p> accommodates competing points of view, remains responsive </p>

<p> to the needs of its constituency, and continues as a </p>

<p> permanent component of State prevention activities (BJA, </p>

<p> 1988). We asked coordinators if the State had a policy </p>

<p> advisory board (PAB), and 15 States (38%) reported </p>

<p> affirmatively. </p>

<p> To explore PAB membership, we asked the 15 </p>

<p> coordinators with PABs to indicate the </p>

<p> agencies/individuals who held memberships on these boards </p>

<p> and to indicate the representative who chaired it.=20 </p>

<p> Exhibit 4.2 shows that 65% or more of the States with </p>

<p> PABs listed State and local educational agencies, local </p>

<p> law enforcement agencies, and State D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> associations among their members. The leadership role of </p>

<p> the PABs was primarily held by law enforcement </p>

<p> representatives. The board was chaired by State law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies in six States, by local law </p>

<p> enforcement in three States, by local education agencies </p>

<p> in two States, by the State Department of Education in </p>

<p> one State, by another State agency in one State, and by </p>

<p> an Association of Chiefs of Police in one State. =20 </p>

<p> as a liaison between the State Department of Education, </p>

<p> local school administrators, and D.A.R.E. instructors </p>

<p> (BJA, 1988). We, therefore, asked if the State had an </p>

<p> educational consultant. Twenty-five (64%) of the 39 </p>

<p> respondents reported having an educational advisor, and </p>

<p> two States reported two advisors. Further, we inquired </p>

<p> about the employers of these consultants and found that </p>

<p> educational systems employed 17 of the 27 educational </p>

<p> advisors and law enforcement agencies employed 4 (Exhibit </p>

<p> 4.3). </p>

<p> Functions. Next, we sought to examine the </p>

<p> responsibilities of both the State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> and the PABs by asking respondents to indicate the </p>

<p> functions of each agency (Exhibit 4.4). The most fre- </p>

<p> quently mentioned roles of State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> were D.A.R.E. advocacy and officer training within the </p>

<p> State. The most frequently mentioned roles of PABs were </p>

<p> formulating State policy, exploring funding sources, and </p>

<p> advocating for D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> We also asked respondents to list functions </p>

<p> performed by the State D.A.R.E. coordinators and the PABs </p>

<p> that were not provided as close-ended response options.=20 </p>

<p> Additional duties mentioned for State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> (three States), </p>

<p> o distributing D.A.R.E. materials (three </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o making and managing grant applications (two </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o training D.A.R.E. officers for schools on </p>

<p> o recertifying officers (one State), </p>

<p> o selecting officers (one State), and </p>

<p> o serving as a clearinghouse for information </p>

<p> (one State). </p>

<p> Other duties performed by the PABs included long-term </p>

<p> planning (two States) and the selection and supervision </p>

<p> of the State D.A.R.E. coordinator (one State). </p>

<p> Communication. As mentioned earlier, State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs are strongly encouraged to develop </p>

<p> relationships with State Departments of Education.=20 </p>

<p> Having an educational consultant, however, does not </p>

<p> guarantee communication between the agencies. We, </p>

<p> therefore, asked the State coordinators about how well </p>

<p> they communicate with the Department of Education. Most </p>

<p> of the State D.A.R.E. coordinators reported having a </p>

<p> great deal (35%) or some (47%) communication with the </p>

<p> State Department of Education. In six States, </p>

<p> coordinators reported little communication, and only one </p>

<p> reported none. Seven coordinators (20%) reported having </p>

<p> a signed agreement between the State D.A.R.E. coordinator </p>

<p> and the Department of Education. =20 </p>

<p> We also asked coordinators about the level of </p>

<p> communication between the PABs and the State Department </p>

<p> of Education. Most of the coordinators reported that </p>

<p> PABs had a great deal of communication with the Depart- </p>

<p> ment of Education. Eight of the 15 States with PABs </p>

<p> reported that their boards had a great deal of </p>

<p> communication, three reported some communication, three </p>

<p> reported little, and one reported none. =20 </p>

<p> Only one State reported that both the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinator and the PAB had little communication </p>

<p> with the Department of Education. </p>

<p> Funding </p>

<p> The NIJ solicitation also requested information on </p>

<p> funding arrangements for D.A.R.E. To this end, we asked </p>

<p> respondents to report the amount of funding received by </p>

<p> the primary managing agency. Exhibit 4.5 presents </p>

<p> ranges of funding received for D.A.R.E. at the State </p>

<p> level. Four States reported that no funds were received </p>

<p> for State-level D.A.R.E. operations, and two State </p>

<p> coordinators were unable to provide this information. =20 </p>

<p> The mean amount of funds received by the primary </p>

<p> managing agency for operating D.A.R.E. at the State level </p>

<p> in the 1991-1992 school year (excluding $0 values) was </p>

<p> $273,657; funding ranged from $25,000 to $2,635,000. The </p>

<p> total amount received by the responding States was </p>

<p> $9,260,700. </p>

<p> $300,000 + 17.9 </p>

<p> Data Unavailable 5.1 </p>

<p> We asked the 33 respondents who reported the amount </p>

<p> of funding for State-level operations to identify the </p>

<p> sources of this funding (Exhibit 4.6). Four of the 33 </p>

<p> respondents did not answer this question. We also asked </p>

<p> coordinators to indicate the percentage of funds received </p>

<p> from each source. Fifteen States indicated that all </p>

<p> funds were received from one source (six from the BJA, </p>

<p> four from State governors' grants, two from the State </p>

<p> Department of Education, two from legislative funds, and </p>

<p> one from other sources). Eight States reported that </p>

<p> funding was received from two sources, and eight States </p>

<p> reported receiving funding from three or more sources. =20 </p>

<p> Additionally, we asked respondents to report other </p>

<p> sources of funding not mentioned in the close-ended </p>

<p> response options. Responses included State and local </p>

<p> matching funds, special education trust funds, State </p>

<p> penalty assessment funds, funds from the Exhibit 4.6 Number

<p> coordinator survey, this information refers to </p>

<p> funding of State-level D.A.R.E. programs only. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America has informed us that all </p>

<p> State-level programs receive support from D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America (Glenn Levant, personal communi- </p>

<p> cation, August 9, 1994). </p>

<p> Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention </p>

<p> (OJJDP), fund-raisers, and Federal forfeiture funds. </p>

<p> State Training Centers </p>

<p> As mentioned in Chapter 3, one goal of the RTCs has </p>

<p> been to develop STCs in their geographic areas.=20 </p>

<p> Increasingly, RTCs have adopted a &quot;train the
trainer&quot; </p>

<p> model to prepare STCs in their jurisdiction to conduct </p>

<p> their own D.A.R.E. officer training and certification </p>

<p> procedures. We, therefore, asked coordinators whether </p>

<p> their State had its own STC. About 87% (34 States) </p>

<p> reported affirmatively. One of the five States without a </p>

<p> training center reported that the State was in the </p>

<p> process of establishing a training center. </p>

<p> Implementation </p>

<p> To obtain a general idea of the level of </p>

<p> implementation of each of D.A.R.E.'s curricula, we asked </p>

<p> respondents to indicate each curriculum used in the State </p>

<p> during the 1991-1992 school year. All respondents </p>

<p> reported that the core curriculum and the K-4 visitations </p>

<p> were used in at least one school in the State.=20 </p>

<p> Furthermore, 28 States (72%) implemented the junior high </p>

<p> curriculum, 26 States (67%) implemented the senior high </p>

<p> school curriculum, and 9 States (23%) implemented the </p>

<p> parent curriculum in at least one school. </p>

<p> Challenges and Problems </p>

<p> To acquire an understanding of the challenges and </p>

<p> problems facing D.A.R.E. and the State D.A.R.E. coordina- </p>

<p> tor in the coming years, we asked two open-ended </p>

<p> questions about these issues. We categorized the </p>

<p> responses and counted the number of State coordinators </p>

<p> indicating each category. (We advise caution in using </p>

<p> these findings to make recommendations given the small </p>

<p> number of coordinators mentioning each category.) =20 </p>

<p> First, we asked respondents to identify the most </p>

<p> significant issues they face in working with the State's </p>

<p> Department of Education. The two most common responses </p>

<p> were improving communication between agencies (mentioned </p>

<p> by eight States) and acquiring a full-time educational </p>

<p> advisor (mentioned by seven States). Most of the other </p>

<p> responses were specific actions that coordinators wanted </p>

<p> the State Department of Education to undertake, such as </p>

<p> o assisting with program evaluation and monitoring </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers (six States), </p>

<p> o formally mandating the D.A.R.E. program (three </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o understanding the role of law enforcement in </p>

<p> education (three States), </p>

<p> o assisting with funding for D.A.R.E. (three </p>

<p> States), </p>

<p> o providing greater support for the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program (two States), </p>

<p> o assisting in training programs (one State), and </p>

<p> o helping resolve problems between officers and </p>

<p> teachers (one State). </p>

<p> We then asked respondents to indicate the most </p>

<p> significant issues facing the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator. It should be noted that most of these </p>

<p> issues could be mentioned by coordinators of other drug </p>

<p> prevention programs, as well as coordinators of D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> Most of the responses centered on funding, communication, </p>

<p> evaluation, and training. The responses, by category, </p>

<p> were as follows:=20 </p>

<p> Funding </p>

<p> o maintaining or increasing funding (13 States) </p>

<p> o locating funding sources (8 States) </p>

<p> o locating funding specifically for training (6 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> Communication </p>

<p> o increasing communication between </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. agencies at the local, </p>

<p> regional, and national levels (10 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> o improving relations with State </p>

<p> Department of Education (4 States) </p>

<p> o coping with the disorganization of the </p>

<p> program (4 States) </p>

<p> o improving public relations (3 States) </p>

<p> o keeping up with constantly shifting </p>

<p> policies of the D.A.R.E. America RTC </p>

<p> Advisory Board (2 States) </p>

<p> Evaluation </p>

<p> o monitoring officers in the classroom (8 </p>

<p> States) </p>

<p> o evaluating the program (4 States) </p>

<p> Training </p>

<p> o improving training (3 States) </p>

<p> o handling problem officers (2 States) </p>

<p> o obtaining STC certification (1 State) </p>

<p> Staffing </p>

<p> o increasing staffing (6 States) </p>

<p> o formally establishing a State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinator position (2 States) </p>

<p> o forming a PAB (2 States) </p>

<p> Expansion </p>

<p> o expanding D.A.R.E. to other grades or </p>

<p> schools (7 States). </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on a survey of the </p>

<p> administrators of the State D.A.R.E. programs. Thirty- </p>

<p> nine of the 44 States with State D.A.R.E. coordinators </p>

<p> responded to the survey. =20 </p>

<p> We found that most of the State D.A.R.E. programs </p>

<p> are managed by law enforcement or criminal justice </p>

<p> agencies and that most retain educational consultants.=20 </p>

<p> About two-fifths of the States had PABs. Most of the </p>

<p> coordinators reported high levels of communication </p>

<p> between themselves and the State Department of Education.=20 </p>

<p> They also reported high levels of communication between </p>

<p> the PABs and the Department of Education. Most States </p>

<p> received at least $50,000 in funding for training and </p>

<p> administrative purposes, and most States had their own </p>

<p> STC. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 5 </p>

<p> SCHOOL DISTRICT DRUG PREVENTION </p>

<p> COORDINATOR SURVEY </p>

<p> A survey of school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators was the main component of our implementation </p>

<p> assessment. This component of the assessment was </p>

<p> conducted to fulfill NIJ's request for information about </p>

<p> the implementation of D.A.R.E. and other school-based </p>

<p> drug prevention programs at the local level. NIJ </p>

<p> specifically requested information on the following </p>

<p> questions: </p>

<p> o Who usually manages the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program at the local level? </p>

<p> o How involved in D.A.R.E. are </p>

<p> classroom teachers, churches, and </p>

<p> community groups? </p>

<p> o How extensively are D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other school-based alcohol and </p>

<p> other drug (AOD) prevention </p>

<p> programs implemented nationwide </p>

<p> in terms of geography, target </p>

<p> populations (such as ethnic </p>

<p> groups, economic strata, and </p>

<p> urbanicity), and grade levels? </p>

<p> o How do other AOD programs compare </p>

<p> with D.A.R.E. and D.A.R.E. with </p>

<p> them? </p>

<p> o What are local funding </p>

<p> arrangements for D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs? How do these </p>

<p> resources affect implementation? </p>

<p> A careful reading of these questions reveals that NIJ had </p>

<p> three primary objectives: (a) to secure information </p>

<p> about the administration of D.A.R.E., (b) to develop </p>

<p> estimates of the national prevalence of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs, and (c) to make comparisons between </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a variety of issues. =20 </p>

<p> RTI staff developed and conducted a comprehensive </p>

<p> survey of school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> that addressed each of the above-mentioned objectives and </p>

<p> questions. We selected drug prevention coordinators as </p>

<p> respondents, as opposed to classroom teachers or police </p>

<p> officers, because we believed that drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators were the school district staff members best </p>

<p> able to provide us with a broad perspective on all drug </p>

<p> prevention activities in the district, including both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD prevention programs. </p>

<p> This chapter presents the methodology and findings </p>

<p> for this survey. We should note that for this chapter </p>

<p> the results we display will be descriptive, as opposed to </p>

<p> explanatory, in nature. That is, our purpose is to </p>

<p> report what the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators have told us, and not attempt to explain why </p>

<p> they responded as they did. Although efforts to explain </p>

<p> our respondents' answer are feasible, we believe they </p>

<p> would ultimately prove unsatisfactory because our </p>

<p> explanatory variables (e.g., the school districts' racial </p>

<p> balance or percentage of youth in poverty) are very </p>

<p> limited, and any differences we find may be misleading. </p>

<p> The findings section first presents information we </p>

<p> received from districts with D.A.R.E., followed by </p>

<p> estimates of the numbers of districts with D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs, and comparisons of D.A.R.E. with </p>

<p> other AOD programs. At the end of the findings section, </p>

<p> we also provide some general information about drug </p>

<p> policies in all the districts surveyed. </p>

<p> Methodology </p>

<p> Sample Design </p>

<p> The sample design for the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators' survey was a two-phased </p>

<p> stratified random sample. The two-phases of the sample </p>

<p> design was necessary to meet the multiple goals of this </p>

<p> survey. The goal of the first-phase sample was to </p>

<p> produce estimates by region, district size, socioeconomic </p>

<p> status (SES) categories, ethnicity categories, and </p>

<p> urbanicity. The goal of the second-phase sample was to </p>

<p> enable comparisons between districts with and without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. A detailed discussion of each phase of the </p>

<p> sample design is discussed below. </p>

<p> Sampling frame. The first step in our sampling </p>

<p> design was to obtain a list of public school districts </p>

<p> nationwide. We obtained such a list from Quality </p>

<p> Educational Data (QED) Inc., of Denver, Colorado. The </p>

<p> QED file, which is updated every summer, lists all public </p>

<p> school districts nationwide and contains a wealth of </p>

<p> useful information for each school district. We used </p>

<p> this file as our sampling frame. Information that we </p>

<p> used from this file included the school district's </p>

<p> o SES (defined as the percentage of </p>

<p> children in the district below </p>

<p> poverty level), </p>

<p> o urbanicity (defined as urban, </p>

<p> suburban, or rural), </p>

<p> o ethnicity (defined as the </p>

<p> percentage of children in the </p>

<p> district who were black or </p>

<p> Hispanic), and </p>

<p> o district size (defined as the </p>

<p> number of students enrolled in </p>

<p> the district). =20 </p>

<p> For each of the 14,715 districts on the QED file, </p>

<p> we created five new variables that we later used for </p>

<p> stratification and weighting purposes. First, we created </p>

<p> a region variable that was based on the jurisdictions of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s five RTCs (see Chapter 3, Exhibit 3.1). Next, </p>

<p> to keep the total number of stratum cells within </p>

<p> reasonable bounds, we dichotomized urbanicity, SES, </p>

<p> ethnicity, and district size. We first collapsed the </p>

<p> urban and suburban categories on the QED file into one </p>

<p> category. We computed percentiles for minority status, </p>

<p> SES, and district size within each region-by-urbanicity </p>

<p> group. We then used the median of each variable to </p>

<p> define two categories (low/high) for each of the three </p>

<p> variables. The number and percentage of school districts </p>

<p> in the sampling frame in each of the strata are presented </p>

<p> in Appendix A, Exhibit A.1. </p>

<p> First-Phase Sampling. The goal of the first-phase </p>

<p> of our sampling design was to ensure that we selected a </p>

<p> nationally representative sample of school districts.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, we wanted to ensure that districts in each </p>

<p> region, urbanicity category, SES category, minority </p>

<p> status category, and district size category were </p>

<p> adequately sampled. Therefore, our first-phase sample </p>

<p> was a stratified random sample. =20 </p>

<p> The first step in selecting our first-phase sample </p>

<p> was to define each strata. We initially constructed 10 </p>

<p> region-by-urbanicity strata by crossing the 5 regional </p>

<p> strata with the 2 urbanicity strata. We then crossed </p>

<p> each of these 10 strata with 2 SES categories (resulting </p>

<p> in 20 strata). We then crossed each of those 20 strata </p>

<p> by minority status (resulting in 40 strata). Finally, we </p>

<p> crossed each of those 40 strata by district size </p>

<p> (resulting in 80 strata). The number of school districts </p>

<p> in the sampling frame in each of the 80 strata is </p>

<p> presented in Appendix A, Exhibit A.2. </p>

<p> The next step in our sampling design was to </p>

<p> determine how districts from each strata would be </p>

<p> selected for inclusion in the first-phase sample. We </p>

<p> assayed two methods of allocating the sample to strata.=20 </p>

<p> In the first method, we assigned equal sample sizes </p>

<p> across strata (i.e., we sampled 15 districts from every </p>

<p> stratum regardless of whether the stratum in the sampling </p>

<p> frame contained 15 or 200 districts). This method would </p>

<p> have ensured good precision across strata. In the second </p>

<p> method, we assigned sample sizes proportional to the </p>

<p> frame size within each stratum. For example, if 5% of </p>

<p> the districts in the sampling frame were in a particular </p>

<p> stratum, proportional sampling would have ensured that 5% </p>

<p> of the first-phase sample would be allocated to that same </p>

<p> stratum. Unlike equal allocation, proportional </p>

<p> allocation yields approximately equal sampling weights, </p>

<p> reduces variance, and thus provides better precision for </p>

<p> overall survey estimates. =20 </p>

<p> Because of its clear advantages, we chose </p>

<p> proportional sampling. Thus, we randomly selected a </p>

<p> proportional number of school districts within each of </p>

<p> the 80 strata. The first-phase sample consisted of 1,500 </p>

<p> school districts. Exhibits displaying the sample </p>

<p> allocation to strata are provided in Appendix A, Exhibits </p>

<p> A.3 and A.4. </p>

<p> Second-Phase Sampling. The goal of the second- </p>

<p> phase of our sampling design was to ensure that the </p>

<p> second-phase sample included both D.A.R.E. and non- </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. school districts. To make this determination, </p>

<p> we asked State D.A.R.E. or DFSCA coordinators to classify </p>

<p> the 1,500 school districts in the first-phase sample as </p>

<p> either D.A.R.E. or non-D.A.R.E. districts (see Chapter </p>

<p> 4). Because some State coordinators did not return this </p>

<p> information or only partially completed the information, </p>

<p> we created a third category of school districts with an </p>

<p> unknown D.A.R.E. status. State coordinators reported </p>

<p> that 43% of the sampled districts used D.A.R.E. and 40% </p>

<p> did not; D.A.R.E. status was unknown for 17% of the </p>

<p> districts. Exhibit A.5 in Appendix A displays the </p>

<p> responses of the State coordinators on the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> status of the first-phase sample by region. </p>

<p> The next step in selecting our second-phase sample </p>

<p> was to determine the number of districts to be selected.=20 </p>

<p> Calculations to determine the number of districts needed </p>

<p> in the second-phase sample were based first on the type </p>

<p> of analysis we planned to conduct and second on an </p>

<p> anticipated 80% response rate. Because we calculated </p>

<p> that 400 responding school districts were necessary to </p>

<p> achieve sufficient statistical power and precision, we </p>

<p> selected a second-phase sample of 500 school districts. </p>

<p> Finally, we used the classifications provided by </p>

<p> the State coordinators to select proportional numbers of </p>

<p> school districts with D.A.R.E., without D.A.R.E., and </p>

<p> with unknown D.A.R.E. status across the five regions.=20 </p>

<p> Thus, we selected 215 school districts with D.A.R.E., 200 </p>

<p> without D.A.R.E., and 85 with unknown D.A.R.E. status.=20 </p>

<p> Exhibit A.6 in Appendix A displays the second-phase </p>

<p> sample by region and D.A.R.E. status. </p>

<p> Survey Estimation. All survey estimates were </p>

<p> computed using software developed at RTI specifically for </p>

<p> the analysis of surveys based on complex sample designs.=20 </p>

<p> We computed analysis weights that took into account the </p>

<p> two-phase stratified sample design. Weighted data </p>

<p> provides a less biased estimate than unweighted data </p>

<p> because the weighted data more accurately represents the </p>

<p> true population. The weights varied across strata based </p>

<p> on region, ethnic composition, urbanicity, SES, and size </p>

<p> of the school district. Analysis weights were computed </p>

<p> as the product of the first-phase sample weight and the </p>

<p> second-phase sample weight. Sampling weights were also </p>

<p> adjusted for nonresponse. We performed quality checks on </p>

<p> the analysis weights to ensure that the sum of the </p>

<p> analysis weights coincides with the number of districts </p>

<p> in the frame. We also examined the variability of the </p>

<p> analyses weights and their impact on survey variances. </p>

<p> Instrument Design </p>

<p> RTI staff determined the contents of the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators' survey based on </p>

<p> the research issues raised in NIJ's solicitation, </p>

<p> discussions with NIJ personnel, a review of the </p>

<p> literature, and examination of the studies of drug </p>

<p> education programming previously conducted at RTI. We </p>

<p> used close-ended items whenever possible to minimize </p>

<p> ambiguity and burden. A few open-ended questions were </p>

<p> included to encourage respondents to provide detailed </p>

<p> information. =20 </p>

<p> All drug prevention coordinators completed a set of </p>

<p> core items that were designed to provide background </p>

<p> information about the district and about the specific </p>

<p> drug prevention curricula used. Additionally, </p>

<p> coordinators in districts using D.A.R.E., alone or in </p>

<p> combination with other drug prevention curricula, </p>

<p> completed a set of items concerning the D.A.R.E. program </p>

<p> only. Coordinators in districts using other AOD </p>

<p> prevention programs, alone or in combination with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., completed a set of items concerning other AOD </p>

<p> (i.e., non-D.A.R.E.) programs only. Therefore, school </p>

<p> districts </p>

<p> implementing D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered </p>

<p> both sets of items. </p>

<p> After submitting the data collection instrument to </p>

<p> our NIJ program manager for comment and discussion, we </p>

<p> formally pretested all data collection materials and </p>

<p> procedures. Both regional and State DFSCA coordinators </p>

<p> assisted in identifying pretest subjects. Seven school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators (two in New York, </p>

<p> two in South Dakota, one in North Carolina, one in Rhode </p>

<p> Island, and one in South Carolina) completed a pretest </p>

<p> questionnaire in early April 1992. </p>

<p> We used the responses of pretest participants, as </p>

<p> well as the comments of our NIJ program manager and other </p>

<p> AOD prevention program experts, to make final decisions </p>

<p> on the data collection procedures and instruments. A </p>

<p> copy of the survey instrument and other data collection </p>

<p> materials for this component of the study can be found in </p>

<p> Appendix D. </p>

<p> Data Collection </p>

<p> On May 1, 1992, we mailed a cover letter, </p>

<p> questionnaire, and prepaid return envelope to school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators in each of the 500 </p>

<p> selected school districts. The cover letter included a </p>

<p> brief statement of study objectives, information on how </p>

<p> the data would be used, and confidentiality assurances.=20 </p>

<p> Approximately 2 weeks after the initial mailing, we sent </p>

<p> postcards to coordinators who had not responded. The </p>

<p> postcard asked if the initial packet had been received, </p>

<p> reminded the coordinator of the importance of the study, </p>

<p> and offered the RTI toll-free number in case assistance </p>

<p> was needed. Upon request, we provided duplicate </p>

<p> mailouts. </p>

<p> Four packages were returned as undeliverable. Each </p>

<p> of these was followed up by telephone inquiry to </p>

<p> ascertain the correct address. We obtained correct </p>

<p> addresses for three of the four returned packages and </p>

<p> remailed the material. The remaining school district had </p>

<p> recently merged with another school district. Because </p>

<p> this merged district was already included in the sample, </p>

<p> the duplicate was dropped. </p>

<p> We began making follow-up telephone calls to </p>

<p> nonresponders approximately 2 weeks after the reminder </p>

<p> postcards were mailed. Follow-up phone calls were made </p>

<p> by trained RTI telephone interviewers between June 2 and </p>

<p> July 15, 1992. Interviewers encouraged coordinators to </p>

<p> complete and return their instruments as soon as </p>

<p> possible. Those coordinators who indicated to </p>

<p> interviewers that they would not otherwise complete the </p>

<p> instrument were asked to complete the survey over the </p>

<p> telephone. The survey instrument was exactly the same </p>

<p> for both telephone and mail administration. The final </p>

<p> response rate was 85.6%, which considerably surpassed our </p>

<p> expected response rate of 80%. The final sample </p>

<p> disposition is presented in Exhibit 5.1. </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.1 Final Sample Disposition </p>

<p> N % </p>

<p> Completed by phone 289 57.8 </p>

<p> Refused 8 1.6 </p>

<p> No response 63 12.6 </p>

<p> Duplicate 1 0.2 </p>

<p> As indicated, we completed almost twice as many </p>

<p> interviews by phone as by mail. We attribute this to </p>

<p> several factors. First, phone surveys traditionally have </p>

<p> higher response rates than mail surveys. Second, the </p>

<p> questionnaires were not mailed until late in the school </p>

<p> year; therefore, coordinators may have had end-of-the- </p>

<p> year obligations that limited the amount of time they </p>

<p> could spend on additional duties. Third, the part of the </p>

<p> instrument that asked about each of the packaged drug </p>

<p> prevention curricula was imposing; we believe that having </p>

<p> the interviewers read these questions to the respondents </p>

<p> may have made answering them less burdensome. Because </p>

<p> the information gathered in this survey was not sensitive </p>

<p> in nature, we believe that data obtained via both methods </p>

<p> of administration are comparable. </p>

<p> Returned questionnaires were delivered to a </p>

<p> check-in station where they were logged in, coded, </p>

<p> manually edited, keyed, and key verified. We implemented </p>

<p> machine-editing procedures to verify and correct skip </p>

<p> patterns and logical inconsistencies. We recontacted a </p>

<p> few school district drug prevention coordinators to </p>

<p> resolve problematic responses, such as incomplete or </p>

<p> contradictory information. </p>

<p> Findings </p>

<p> Administration of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The first objective of this survey was to obtain </p>

<p> information about the administration of D.A.R.E. at the </p>

<p> local level. This section presents findings concerning </p>

<p> the implementation, administration, participation of </p>

<p> teachers and the community in the D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> integration and coordination of D.A.R.E. with other </p>

<p> school-based drug prevention efforts, problems with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and future plans for the use of D.A.R.E. Data </p>

<p> from survey items asked only of the districts with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. are presented in this section. =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. In the 1991-1992 school year, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was implemented in 51.8%, or 222, of the school </p>

<p> districts surveyed. Some 42% of all school districts </p>

<p> surveyed used the core curriculum, 17% used K-4 lessons, </p>

<p> 11% implemented the junior high school curriculum, 3% </p>

<p> used the senior high school curriculum, and 3% used the </p>

<p> parent curriculum. =20 </p>

<p> Of the 222 school districts with D.A.R.E., the </p>

<p> great majority (81%) implemented the core curriculum, </p>

<p> around 33% used the K-4 visitations, 22% used the junior </p>

<p> high school curriculum, 6% implemented the senior high </p>

<p> school curriculum, and 5% used the parent curriculum. We </p>

<p> further asked the respondents to indicate every grade in </p>

<p> which the D.A.R.E. curricula were used. Exhibit 5.2 </p>

<p> displays the percentage of school districts with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> implementing the program at each grade. Almost 70% of </p>

<p> the districts with D.A.R.E. implemented the curriculum in </p>

<p> 5th-grade classes, and almost 60% used it in 6th-grade </p>

<p> classes. Thus, a substantial number of districts </p>

<p> implemented the core curriculum in both grades, which </p>

<p> probably reflects the different cutoff grades separating </p>

<p> elementary from junior high or middle schools in that </p>

<p> district. </p>

<p> Administration. One objective of NIJ's </p>

<p> solicitation was to ascertain what agencies usually </p>

<p> manage D.A.R.E. and have responsibility for various </p>

<p> aspects of the program at the local level. To address </p>

<p> these issues, we first asked coordinators to report all </p>

<p> agencies managing D.A.R.E. Around 81% of the districts </p>

<p> with D.A.R.E. reported that a single agency administered </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. program, while 16.3% reported that two </p>

<p> agencies and 2.3% reported that three or more agencies </p>

<p> administered the program (Exhibit 5.3). Almost 34% of </p>

<p> the school districts with D.A.R.E. reported that the </p>

<p> county sheriff's department alone administered the </p>

<p> program, and about 34% reported city/town police </p>

<p> departments administered it.=20 </p>

<p> We next asked coordinators to report whether law </p>

<p> enforcement or education was responsible for various </p>

<p> activities. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. most frequently </p>

<p> reported that law enforcement agencies were responsible </p>

<p> for selecting D.A.R.E. officers and determining classroom </p>

<p> activities (Exhibit 5.4). They reported that </p>

<p> responsibility for selecting schools to receive D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> selecting classrooms to receive D.A.R.E., and assigning </p>

<p> extracurricular D.A.R.E. activities were performed by </p>

<p> education. </p>

<p> Participation of Teachers and Community. NIJ's </p>

<p> solicitation also requested an examination of the extent </p>

<p> of involvement of classroom teachers. About 84% of the </p>

<p> coordinators reported that classroom teachers were </p>

<p> actively involved in the program. We also asked </p>

<p> coordinators about classroom teachers' level of </p>

<p> participation during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 21% </p>

<p> reported a great deal of participation, 46% reported some </p>

<p> participation, 28% reported little participation, and 5% </p>

<p> reported no participation by the classroom teachers. =20 </p>

<p> To determine the extent to which teachers reinforce </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lessons, we asked coordinators about </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.-related activities performed by classroom </p>

<p> teachers. Most of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators (89%) reported that teachers remain in the </p>

<p> classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons. About 72% reported </p>

<p> that classroom teachers integrate the D.A.R.E. message </p>

<p> into other activities, 39% said that teachers collect </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. homework, and 15% reported that teachers assign </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. homework. </p>

<p> The NIJ solicitation also requested that we examine </p>

<p> the extent to which members of community groups (e.g., </p>

<p> church or youth groups) participate in the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. Indeed, recent research suggests that linking </p>

<p> school-based interventions with the larger community </p>

<p> strengthens their effectiveness (Pentz et al., 1989; </p>

<p> Perry &amp; Tobler, 1992). Therefore, we asked the </p>

<p> prevention coordinators to specify members of the </p>

<p> community who were actively involved in D.A.R.E. About </p>

<p> 51% of the coordinators said that parents were actively </p>

<p> involved, 22% indicated that civic groups were so </p>

<p> involved, 13% said that youth groups were so involved, </p>

<p> and 5% said that church groups were so involved. </p>

<p> Integration and Coordination. Another objective </p>

<p> of this study was to examine the extent of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> integration and coordination with other school-based drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts. To address this issue, we first </p>

<p> asked coordinators to indicate the level at which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was integrated with other AOD programs. About </p>

<p> 63% of the prevention coordinators reported D.A.R.E. was </p>

<p> very well integrated, 31% reported it was well </p>

<p> integrated, and 7% reported it was poorly integrated. To </p>

<p> determine whether D.A.R.E. was better integrated in some </p>

<p> types of school districts than in others, we examined the </p>

<p> differences in the percentages of coordinators reporting </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. was very well integrated by minority </p>

<p> status, SES, urbanicity, and district size. No </p>

<p> statistically significant differences were found.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was equally well integrated with other AOD </p>

<p> programs across different types of school districts. </p>

<p> One type of mechanism for coordinating the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> responsibilities of law enforcement with those of </p>

<p> education agencies are written agreements that solidify </p>

<p> commitment, define roles and duties, and establish sound </p>

<p> working relationships. We asked coordinators about the </p>

<p> existence of such agreements and found that approximately </p>

<p> 44% of the coordinators reported that their district had </p>

<p> a written agreement. We asked those coordinators with </p>

<p> written agreements about the contents of these </p>

<p> agreements. The following components of the agreements </p>

<p> were mentioned by the accompanying number of </p>

<p> coordinators: </p>

<p> o the responsibilities of all parties (23 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o time (21 coordinators); </p>

<p> o funding/fees (20 coordinators); </p>

<p> o scheduling (15 coordinators); </p>

<p> o curricula (10 coordinators); </p>

<p> o schools to be offered in (9 coordinators); </p>

<p> o grades used in (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o general use of D.A.R.E. (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o length of program (5 coordinators); </p>

<p> o school policies (4 coordinators); </p>

<p> o sequence of lessons (3 coordinators); </p>

<p> o materials (3 coordinators);=20 </p>

<p> o graduation program (3 coordinators); and </p>

<p> o &quot;don't know&quot; (4 coordinators). </p>

<p> Problems. We asked school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators to provide information concerning problems </p>

<p> with implementing and coordinating D.A.R.E., and to </p>

<p> suggest how the effectiveness of D.A.R.E. might be </p>

<p> improved.=20 </p>

<p> We asked coordinators to indicate whether there </p>

<p> were any barriers to implementing D.A.R.E. and then to </p>

<p> specify these barriers. Only 26% of the school district </p>

<p> drug prevention coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned any </p>

<p> barrier to implementing the program. Some 16% of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. mentioned inadequate funding </p>

<p> as a barrier to implementation, 13% mentioned too few </p>

<p> officers, and 11% mentioned scheduling difficulties </p>

<p> (Figure 5.5). The two most frequently mentioned barriers </p>

<p> were in areas over which the school system has little </p>

<p> control (funding and number of officers). </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.5 Problem Areas That Are Barriers to </p>

<p> Implementing D.A.R.E. in All Schools </p>

<p> Note: Based on responses of coordinators using D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> (N=3D222). </p>

<p> Next, in an open-ended question, we asked </p>

<p> coordinators to elaborate on any problems with the </p>

<p> coordination of D.A.R.E. The responses of those with </p>

<p> problems were </p>

<p> o lack of time (19 coordinators); </p>

<p> o insufficient funding/staff (12 coordinators); </p>

<p> o scheduling problems (9 coordinators); </p>

<p> o officers not good teachers (5 coordinators); </p>

<p> o difficulties getting program started (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o inadequate officer/teacher interaction (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o officer scheduling problems/absences (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o other officer problems (4 coordinators); and </p>

<p> o lack of coordination between school and </p>

<p> police (3 coordinators). </p>

<p> Finally, we asked coordinators what, if any, </p>

<p> changes they thought would make D.A.R.E. more effective </p>

<p> in their district, and then to elaborate on these </p>

<p> changes. About one-third of the coordinators mentioned </p>

<p> that there was at least one change that they thought </p>

<p> would make D.A.R.E. more effective. The following </p>

<p> responses were the changes they mentioned: </p>

<p> o expand to other grade levels (26 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase staff/officers (11 coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase parental participation (7 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase funding (6 coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase community involvement (6 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase teacher training and involvement (5 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o improve quality/dependability officers (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase integration with other curricula (4 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o decrease time spent on D.A.R.E. (3 </p>

<p> coordinators); =20 </p>

<p> o increase publicity (2 coordinators); </p>

<p> o adapt curriculum to grade level (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o change curricula (2 coordinators); </p>

<p> o teach officers to be teachers (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o increase refresher training for officers (2 </p>

<p> coordinators); </p>

<p> o include D.A.R.E. as part of student </p>

<p> assistance program (1 coordinator); </p>

<p> o increase D.A.R.E.'s availability in </p>

<p> rural/isolated areas (1 coordinator). </p>

<p> Future Use of D.A.R.E. To examine whether the </p>

<p> demand for D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> going to increase or diminish over the next few years, we </p>

<p> asked coordinators about their future plans for D.A.R.E.=20 </p>

<p> Some 43% of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. planned to </p>

<p> expand use of D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, and 55% </p>

<p> planned to maintain the current level (only 2% planned to </p>

<p> decrease use). Of the 208 school districts without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., 38% had not considered using D.A.R.E., 21% </p>

<p> planned to implement D.A.R.E. in the future, 20% were </p>

<p> undecided, 15% reported they definitely will not use </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and 6% had discontinued use of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Further, to determine whether any particular type </p>

<p> of school district was more likely to expand use of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in the next 5 years, we examined the differences </p>

<p> in the percentages of districts planning to increase </p>

<p> their use of D.A.R.E. by minority status, SES, or </p>

<p> urbanicity. No statistically significant differences </p>

<p> were found. Plans for the expansion of D.A.R.E. were </p>

<p> fairly equal across different types of school districts.=20 </p>

<p> National Prevalence Estimates of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD </p>

<p> Programs </p>

<p> The second objective of this survey was to develop </p>

<p> national estimates of the prevalence of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs. To accomplish this objective, we </p>

<p> asked coordinators to indicate all published drug </p>

<p> prevention curricula used by the school district in the </p>

<p> 1991-1992 school year. Based on previous research and </p>

<p> discussions with school-based drug prevention curricula </p>

<p> experts, we provided a list of 13 published curricula </p>

<p> that we thought coordinators would mention most often.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, we provided ample space for open-ended </p>

<p> responses concerning other published curricula. We </p>

<p> used this information in combination with the sample </p>

<p> stratification variables to develop estimates by </p>

<p> geographical area, ethnicity, SES, and urbanicity. We </p>

<p> also asked respondents to complete a series of questions </p>

<p> concerning grade levels and substances targeted, as well </p>

<p> as type of teachers for each of these curricula.=20 </p>

<p> Based on the number of school districts in our </p>

<p> sample using the three most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> curricula, we estimated the number of school districts </p>

<p> nationwide using these curricula. These prevalence </p>

<p> estimates and other findings concerning the three most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned published drug prevention curricula </p>

<p> used in the 1991-1992 school year are presented below. </p>

<p> Prevalence. According to our estimates, the </p>

<p> published curricula used most often by our respondents in </p>

<p> estimated numbers and percentages of school districts </p>

<p> nationwide using these three curricula overall and by the </p>

<p> significantly more likely than small school districts to </p>

<p> use D.A.R.E. (p&lt;.01). =20 </p>

<p> Grade Levels Targeted. To determine grade levels </p>

<p> targeted by each of the three most frequently used </p>

<p> curricula, we asked coordinators to indicate which </p>

<p> curricula were used in the school district at each grade </p>

<p> level. Grade levels targeted by coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. were presented in Exhibit 5.2. Around 46% of </p>

<p> the school districts with Quest targeted the program to </p>

<p> the elementary school level, 81% to the middle/junior </p>

<p> high school level, and 12% to the senior high school </p>

<p> level. Almost 89% of the school districts with HLY </p>

<p> targeted the program to the elementary school level, 55% </p>

<p> to the middle/junior high school level, and 35% to the </p>

<p> senior high school level. Coordinators reported that all </p>

<p> three curricula were more likely to target elementary or </p>

<p> middle/junior high school levels. </p>

<p> Substances Targeted. To determine whether the </p>

<p> three most frequently mentioned curricula differed in </p>

<p> substances targeted by the program, we asked the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators to indicate which </p>

<p> substances each of the prevention curricula targeted. We </p>

<p> found no significant differences in substances targeted </p>

<p> among D.A.R.E., Quest, and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). All three </p>

<p> of the packages were comprehensive in targeting all </p>

<p> substances.=20 </p>

<p> expected, almost all school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that police officers were </p>

<p> responsible for teaching the D.A.R.E. curricula.=20 </p>

<p> Classroom teachers were primarily responsible for </p>

<p> teaching Quest and HLY (Exhibit 5.7). More than one- </p>

<p> fifth of the coordinators reported that classroom </p>

<p> teachers were also involved in teaching D.A.R.E. =20 </p>

<p> Comparison of D.A.R.E. and Other AOD Programs </p>

<p> The final objective of this study was to make </p>

<p> comparisons between D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs on a </p>

<p> variety of issues. Comparison data are presented in this </p>

<p> section. Topics include funding, satisfaction with the </p>

<p> curricula, support for the curricula, and adaptations to </p>

<p> curricula. We asked respondents to report on other AOD </p>

<p> curricula in general because it would have been too </p>

<p> burdensome and time-consuming for them to answer each of </p>

<p> the questions for every curricula in use during the 1991- </p>

<p> 1992 school year. =20 </p>

<p> We first asked school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. (222 of the 429 respondents) </p>

<p> to answer a set of survey items concerning their D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs only. We asked all coordinators using other </p>

<p> (non-D.A.R.E.) AOD programs (406 of the 429 respondents) </p>

<p> to answer an identical set of items concerning their </p>

<p> other AOD curricula only. The respondents using both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs answered both sets of </p>

<p> items. Information gathered from these matched sets of </p>

<p> questions allowed a direct comparison of responses about </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. curricula with responses concerning other </p>

<p> AOD curricula. Only 3% of the districts used only </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.; 46% used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used </p>

<p> both D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula. </p>

<p> Funding. The first comparisons we examined were </p>

<p> comparisons of funding. We asked respondents to indicate </p>

<p> all sources of funding for the districts' D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs (Exhibit 5.8). The most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned sources of funding for D.A.R.E. were law </p>

<p> enforcement agencies and DFSCA education funds. The most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned sources of funding for other AOD </p>

<p> programs were DFSCA education funds and school district </p>

<p> funds. D.A.R.E. programs were more likely than other AOD </p>

<p> programs to receive funding from city/county funds, </p>

<p> corporate donations, and individual donations. </p>

<p> Satisfaction with Curricula. Next, we compared </p>

<p> satisfaction ratings for each of the curricula. We asked </p>

<p> the school district drug prevention coordinators to rate </p>

<p> five program components as very satisfactory, </p>

<p> satisfactory, unsatisfactory or very unsatisfactory. The </p>

<p> five components were curriculum, teaching, administrative </p>

<p> requirements, student receptivity, and effects on </p>

<p> students. None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. rated </p>

<p> any of the five components as very unsatisfactory.=20 </p>

<p> Approximately 1% of the respondents with other AOD </p>

<p> programs rated teaching, administrative requirements, or </p>

<p> effects on students as very unsatisfactory. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was much more likely than other AOD </p>

<p> programs to be viewed by the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators as very satisfactory on each of </p>

<p> the five components (Exhibit 5.9). Well over half of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. rated each of the components </p>

<p> as very satisfactory. Between 23% and 35% of the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs rated each of the </p>

<p> components as very satisfactory. Students' receptivity </p>

<p> was the component with the highest percentage of </p>

<p> coordinators rating it as very satisfactory for both </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs. =20 </p>

<p> To determine whether school districts with </p>

<p> particular characteristics were more likely to rate </p>

<p> program components as very satisfactory than other </p>

<p> districts, we examined ratings of each of the components </p>

<p> by these characteristics. Among coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., those in high-percentage minority districts </p>

<p> were significantly more likely than those in low- </p>

<p> percentage minority districts to rate student receptivity </p>

<p> as very satisfactory (p&lt;.05) (Exhibit 5.10). Among </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs, those in urban </p>

<p> districts were significantly more likely (p&lt;.05) than </p>

<p> those in rural districts to rate student receptivity and </p>

<p> effects on students as very satisfactory (Exhibit 5.11).=20 </p>

<p> There were no significant differences in components rated </p>

<p> as very satisfactory between D.A.R.E. programs in low and </p>

<p> high SES districts or between other AOD programs in low </p>

<p> and high SES districts. Furthermore, there were no </p>

<p> significant differences in components rated as very </p>

<p> satisfactory between D.A.R.E. programs in small and large </p>

<p> districts or between other AOD programs in small and </p>

<p> large districts. </p>

<p> Support for Curricula. We also asked the school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators to indicate how </p>

<p> groups to be of D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> Response options for these questions were very </p>

<p> supportive, somewhat supportive, and not supportive.=20 </p>

<p> None of the respondents with D.A.R.E. perceived students </p>

<p> or law enforcement as unsupportive of the program (data </p>

<p> not shown). The percentages of coordinators who </p>

<p> perceived any of the listed individuals or agencies as </p>

<p> unsupportive were very small for both D.A.R.E. and other </p>

<p> Adaptations of Curricula. Some drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula, such as D.A.R.E., require instructors to </p>

<p> strictly adhere to the curricula and established </p>

<p> procedures. Other curricula allow instructors to adapt </p>

<p> the curricula to meet their particular needs. However, </p>

<p> little is known about how prevention curricula are </p>

<p> actually adapted. We asked the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators whether D.A.R.E. or other AOD </p>

<p> programs were adapted in any way as a result of gang </p>

<p> activity, drug availability, the racial/ethnic </p>

<p> composition of the district, student or community </p>

<p> poverty, urbanicity, or for some other reason. About 43% </p>

<p> of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported adapting </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for at least one of these reasons, while about </p>

<p> 54% of the coordinators with other AOD programs reported </p>

<p> adapting for one of these reasons. </p>

<p> Exhibit 5.15 presents the percentage adapting </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and other AOD curricula as a result of the </p>

<p> above-mentioned issues. The most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> reasons for adapting both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs </p>

<p> were drug availability and student/community poverty. </p>

<p> Respondents with D.A.R.E. were provided with </p>

<p> were adapted. Adaptations mentioned by the coordinators </p>

<p> included: </p>

<p> o targeting particular drugs </p>

<p> prevalent in the area; </p>

<p> o making adaptations for the </p>

<p> physically and mentally </p>

<p> handicapped; </p>

<p> o adding more information on </p>

<p> o communicating with families of </p>

<p> youth to gain familial support </p>

<p> and ensure attendance at </p>

<p> graduation; </p>

<p> o taking field trips; and </p>

<p> o omitting lessons. </p>

<p> General Drug Policies </p>

<p> In this final section of Chapter 5, we present </p>

<p> information from responses to questions that were </p>

<p> designed to examine general drug policies in the school </p>

<p> districts. All coordinators responded to these questions </p>

<p> regardless of whether they used D.A.R.E. or any other </p>

<p> drug prevention curricula. =20 </p>

<p> Anti-Drug Policies. We first asked whether the </p>

<p> school district had a written anti-drug policy. We found </p>

<p> that 96% did have such a policy. </p>

<p> Student Assistance Programs. One type of drug </p>

<p> prevention program that many schools have adopted is the </p>

<p> student assistance program (SAP). Modeled after employee </p>

<p> assistance programs (EAPs) in businesses, SAPs conduct </p>

<p> such activities as screening for alcohol and drug </p>

<p> involvement, making referrals, and developing and </p>

<p> coordinating early intervention plans for youth with </p>

<p> problems that could lead to substance abuse. =20 </p>

<p> Almost 55% of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that their districts had SAPs in </p>

<p> place during the 1991-1992 school year. Of the 237 </p>

<p> districts with SAPs, 51% targeted these programs to the </p>

<p> elementary school level, 78% focused on the middle/junior </p>

<p> high school level, and 81% targeted the senior high </p>

<p> school level. </p>

<p> We asked the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators using SAPs to indicate what types of </p>

<p> individuals were trained to participate in these programs </p>

<p> (Exhibit 5.16). Almost 89% of the coordinators mentioned </p>

<p> that teachers had been trained, and nearly 75% mentioned </p>

<p> that principals and guidance counselors had been trained </p>

<p> to participate in SAPs. </p>

<p> We also asked the coordinators using SAPs to </p>

<p> indicate the types of individuals who actually </p>

<p> implemented the programs and how effective they were </p>

<p> (Exhibit 5.17). Coordinators most frequently mentioned </p>

<p> that teachers, principals, guidance counselors, and </p>

<p> students implemented SAPs. However, they perceived </p>

<p> guidance counselors, D.A.R.E. officers, and </p>

<p> district/school nurses as the most effective at </p>

<p> implementing these programs. Coordinators most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned that community professionals and </p>

<p> community volunteers were not effective.=20 </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on the results of our </p>

<p> nationally representative, random sample of 500 school </p>

<p> districts. A total of 429 school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators responded to the survey. Data </p>

<p> presented in this chapter were weighted to take into </p>

<p> account the complex sample design. </p>

<p> Over half of the school districts in the United </p>

<p> States used D.A.R.E. in the 1991-1992 school year.=20 </p>

<p> Additionally, demand for the program is going to increase </p>

<p> over the next few years; two-fifths of those with the </p>

<p> program planned to expand its use and one-fifth of these </p>

<p> without the program plan to begin use. The two other </p>

<p> most frequently used packaged curricula were Quest and </p>

<p> Here's Looking at You, both used by about one-fourth of </p>

<p> the districts. </p>

<p> Only 3% of the districts used only D.A.R.E.; 46% </p>

<p> used only other AOD curricula; and 49% used both D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and other AOD curricula. Most of the coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. reported receiving funding for the program from </p>

<p> law enforcement and/or DFSCA funds. Most of the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs reported receiving </p>

<p> funding for these programs from DFSCA and/or district </p>

<p> funds. D.A.R.E. was more likely than other AOD programs </p>

<p> to be rated very satisfactory in terms of curriculum, </p>

<p> teaching, administrative requirements, student </p>

<p> receptivity, and effects on students. Furthermore, </p>

<p> coordinators were more likely to indicate that the </p>

<p> community, school personnel, students, parents, law </p>

<p> enforcement, and civic groups were very supportive of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E than of other AOD programs. Around two-fifths of </p>

<p> the coordinators with D.A.R.E. and over one-half the </p>

<p> coordinators with other AOD programs reported adapting </p>

<p> the program to meet their needs. The most common reasons </p>

<p> for adaptation for both D.A.R.E. and other AOD programs </p>

<p> were drug availability and student/community poverty. </p>

<p> Most of the D.A.R.E. programs were administered at </p>

<p> the local level by a single law enforcement agency (i.e., </p>

<p> sheriff's department or city/town police department). In </p>

<p> most districts, coordinators reported that officer </p>

<p> selection and classroom activities were the </p>

<p> responsibility of the police, while school and classroom </p>

<p> selection were the responsibility of education. </p>

<p> Findings from this chapter and resulting </p>

<p> recommendations are discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 6 </p>

<p> SITE VISITS </p>

<p> The final component of the implementation </p>

<p> assessment consisted of site visits to school districts.=20 </p>

<p> We designed these visits to obtain a snapshot of the </p>

<p> organization and operations of D.A.R.E. and other school- </p>

<p> based drug prevention programs. The site visits also </p>

<p> gave us an opportunity to speak with the officers, </p>

<p> teachers, and students directly and to see the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program in action.=20 </p>

<p> For the site visits, we selected four schools in </p>

<p> three school districts. Two of the school districts were </p>

<p> adjacent to one another in a northern inner-city </p>

<p> environment, with a large minority population and a </p>

<p> substantial drug problem. The third school district was </p>

<p> located in a rural area in the South; it also had a </p>

<p> substantial minority population but less of a drug </p>

<p> problem. The school in one urban school district had </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., and the school in the other urban district did </p>

<p> not have D.A.R.E. In the rural district, one school had </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and one did not. </p>

<p> Because the school districts and schools were </p>

<p> limited in number and purposively, rather than randomly, </p>

<p> selected, the information gathered from these sites is </p>

<p> not representative of schools in general. We present </p>

<p> data gathered from this component of the assessment to </p>

<p> illustrate and complement findings from other components </p>

<p> of the implementation assessment. We recognize the need </p>

<p> to exercise caution in interpreting site visit findings </p>

<p> and encourage readers to use similar discretion. </p>

<p> For the site visit interviews and observations, we </p>

<p> developed site visit protocols that were based on issues </p>

<p> raised in the previous components of the implementation </p>

<p> assessment. The protocols were designed to elicit </p>

<p> general, open-ended, and free-flowing discussions. We </p>

<p> used protocols instead of structured surveys because we </p>

<p> believed the structured format would inhibit the </p>

<p> exploration of schools' individual characteristics.=20 </p>

<p> Further, we expected respondents would provide us with a </p>

<p> wealth of information that a structured format might have </p>

<p> prevented. We often departed from the protocols to </p>

<p> follow up any line of inquiry that appeared of potential </p>

<p> interest. As a result, the reports from our sites are in </p>

<p> some ways dissimilar. Copies of the protocols can be </p>

<p> found in Appendix D. =20 </p>

<p> Site visits were conducted by two teams. Each team </p>

<p> included at least one senior investigator with </p>

<p> considerable experience in conducting site visits. A </p>

<p> two-person team conducted a 2-day site visit in the urban </p>

<p> schools, and a four-person team conducted a 1-day site </p>

<p> visit in the rural schools. Two or more site visitors </p>

<p> jointly interviewed key individuals, and each interviewer </p>

<p> took notes to reduce the chances of missing key </p>

<p> information. When appropriate, we interviewed up to four </p>

<p> individuals at the same time. </p>

<p> Each team conducted interviews with a variety of </p>

<p> individuals, including </p>

<p> o the coordinator responsible for the </p>

<p> development and implementation of drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts in the school </p>

<p> district; </p>

<p> o individuals teaching drug prevention </p>

<p> curricula to students (including </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers at schools with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.), </p>

<p> o their supervisors (if any), and </p>

<p> o teachers in whose classes D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers teach (at D.A.R.E. sites). </p>

<p> When available, we also interviewed others involved in </p>

<p> drug prevention program planning, delivery, or referral </p>

<p> (e.g., representatives of community advisory or drug </p>

<p> action groups). =20 </p>

<p> In each of the two D.A.R.E. schools, the site visit </p>

<p> team monitored a D.A.R.E. lesson and the officer's </p>

<p> activities in the school outside the classroom. We also </p>

<p> observed a drug prevention lesson in both of the schools </p>

<p> without D.A.R.E. We note that both of the classroom </p>

<p> observations in the non-D.A.R.E. schools were conducted </p>

<p> in special education classes. The selection of classes </p>

<p> to be monitored was based on what teacher was teaching </p>

<p> drug prevention the day of our site visit and the </p>

<p> discretion of the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator. </p>

<p> This chapter contains two sections. In the first, </p>

<p> we discuss drug prevention programming in the urban </p>

<p> schools; and in the second, we describe drug prevention </p>

<p> programming in the rural schools. Within each section, </p>

<p> we present information about the D.A.R.E. school, </p>

<p> followed by information about the non-D.A.R.E. school. </p>

<p> Urban Schools </p>

<p> Urban School with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The school we selected received D.A.R.E. after </p>

<p> being on a waiting list for approximately 1 year; all </p>

<p> 5th-grade classes and one 6th-grade class in the school </p>

<p> received D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed three individuals involved in the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program: </p>

<p> o the police administrator in </p>

<p> charge of the local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program (an officer with many </p>

<p> years of experience who had </p>

<p> administered D.A.R.E. for </p>

<p> 5 years); </p>

<p> o a D.A.R.E. officer (involved with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for 5 years and </p>

<p> currently teaching 16 classes a </p>

<p> week); =20 </p>

<p> o the school district drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinator.=20 </p>

<p> The following summarizes our discussions with these </p>

<p> respondents. =20 </p>

<p> Administration. According to the police </p>

<p> administrator, the D.A.R.E. program in this city follows </p>

<p> the same procedures employed nationally. He stated that </p>

<p> the local police, State police, and Board of Education </p>

<p> work together to provide the D.A.R.E. program. He </p>

<p> further indicated that this coordination has ensured the </p>

<p> integrity of D.A.R.E.'s implementation, D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> consistency with drug education required by the State, </p>

<p> and smooth integration with other drug education </p>

<p> initiatives. =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. Initial steps in the </p>

<p> implementation of the D.A.R.E. program, as reported by </p>

<p> the police administrator, are as follows. The local </p>

<p> police department conducts initial screening of candidate </p>

<p> officers for the D.A.R.E. program. Potential D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers are interviewed by the local police department, </p>

<p> and then by the State police. Successfully screened </p>

<p> candidates are sent for a 2-week training program offered </p>

<p> by the State police. After completing the training, </p>

<p> officers are assigned to particular schools or sets of </p>

<p> schools by the local police department. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer who was interviewed indicated that he is assigned </p>

<p> a general target area and allowed to select the schools </p>

<p> in that area in which he wishes to teach. He indicated </p>

<p> that he and other officers are provided with a list of </p>

<p> schools that have requested D.A.R.E. to guide their </p>

<p> selections. He further reported that no more than 20% of </p>

<p> the schools he selects can be private. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, a limited </p>

<p> attempt is made to match officer and student </p>

<p> characteristics. For example, he stated that in the </p>

<p> Hispanic community, the local police department attempts </p>

<p> to provide D.A.R.E. officers who can speak Spanish.=20 </p>

<p> Beyond this, however, he indicated that little matching </p>

<p> occurs. =20 </p>

<p> The police administrator said that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program is monitored by both the State and local police </p>

<p> departments. He reported that a staff member from the </p>

<p> State police visits each D.A.R.E. instructor during the </p>

<p> year to observe and assess teaching skills and students' </p>

<p> receptiveness to the program, as well as to solicit </p>

<p> feedback from classroom teachers. The administrator also </p>

<p> stated that he monitors classroom activities as part of </p>

<p> his supervisory responsibilities. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, school </p>

<p> personnel are very supportive of the D.A.R.E. program, in </p>

<p> part because the program is free to the school. The </p>

<p> schools are, thus, able to use their drug prevention </p>

<p> resources for additional drug prevention purposes. </p>

<p> The police administrator indicated that some </p>

<p> teachers get involved in the D.A.R.E. program because of </p>

<p> personal interest, but that most do not. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer reported that although State policy requires </p>

<p> teachers to remain in the classroom during the lesson, </p>

<p> they assist him only in disciplinary matters. The drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinator indicated that although teachers </p>

<p> do not participate in teaching the lessons, they have </p>

<p> been very receptive both to the program and the officers.=20 </p>

<p> The coordinator noted that teachers cannot be required to </p>

<p> allow D.A.R.E. into their classrooms, and the fact that </p>

<p> no teacher has refused D.A.R.E. indicates the degree of </p>

<p> acceptance that the program enjoys. When asked about </p>

<p> problems between regular teachers and D.A.R.E. officers, </p>

<p> the police administrator reported that although there are </p>

<p> some individuals who do not get along, it is not a </p>

<p> system-wide problem. The D.A.R.E. officer stated that </p>

<p> although principals are supportive of the program, he has </p>

<p> yet to see one in his classes, and that no other school </p>

<p> staff participate in the program. </p>

<p> The police administrator indicated that parental </p>

<p> involvement generally has taken the form of assistance </p>

<p> from the PTA in co-sponsoring D.A.R.E. graduation </p>

<p> ceremonies. However, he stated that the level of </p>

<p> parental involvement varies substantially from one school </p>

<p> to another. The D.A.R.E. officer reported that in his </p>

<p> experience parents generally do not show an active </p>

<p> interest in D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, the </p>

<p> investment of the community in the D.A.R.E. program is </p>

<p> limited. He further indicated that D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> have little time to seek community involvement: &quot;The </p>

<p> reality is that the D.A.R.E. instructor has a full day </p>

<p> teaching classes; there isn't time to do anything
else.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer also reported that community groups </p>

<p> have little participation in the program. </p>

<p> Funding. The police administrator reported that </p>

<p> when the D.A.R.E. program began in this city, much of the </p>

<p> funding came from the Federal Government (i.e., from BJA </p>

<p> through a grant to the State police). He reported that </p>

<p> support received from the State police is currently </p>

<p> limited to training and materials. Salaries of officers </p>

<p> and supervisors are paid by the local police department, </p>

<p> and limited contributions are provided by the community.=20 </p>

<p> According to the police administrator, there is real </p>

<p> danger of D.A.R.E. becoming a victim of budget cuts </p>

<p> because of the current budget crisis; he indicated that </p>

<p> implementation has already been severely restricted </p>

<p> because of lack of resources. </p>

<p> Curriculum. We asked the police administrator </p>

<p> whether the D.A.R.E. curriculum was adapted to meet the </p>

<p> special needs of his area. He responded, &quot;We teach </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. D.A.R.E. is D.A.R.E. Once you decide to use a </p>

<p> program that is administered throughout the country, then </p>

<p> you do not tailor it.&quot; When asked about addressing the </p>

<p> needs resulting from gang activity, he indicated that </p>

<p> officers incorporate their own street experiences and </p>

<p> information they received from the police academy into </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. gang lessons. He reported that local gangs </p>

<p> and their behaviors are discussed. =20 </p>

<p> The police administrator stated that local D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> advocates believe that classroom activity should be </p>

<p> supported by parental involvement. He, however, did not </p>

<p> express interest in the parent curriculum at this time.=20 </p>

<p> The reasons he gave were that the program is still </p>

<p> experimental and has not been evaluated, the supply of </p>

<p> officers is already inadequate to meet the demand, and </p>

<p> the cost of the parent program would dramatically </p>

<p> increase overall costs (i.e., because the parent </p>

<p> curriculum is generally offered in the evening, officers </p>

<p> would be paid time-and-a-half). The police administrator </p>

<p> stated that &quot;If more money was available, this (parent </p>

<p> curriculum) would certainly be an option the local </p>

<p> department would look into.&quot; </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The police </p>

<p> administrator stated, &quot;One of our major problems is that
</p>

<p> we have so few officers and so many schools.&quot; He </p>

<p> indicated that the department tries to &quot;keep D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> moving through the schools&quot; and to cover as many
students </p>

<p> as possible. The administrator reported that although </p>

<p> this rotation policy maximizes the number of schools </p>

<p> reached within the department's limited resources, it </p>

<p> also creates problems (i.e., just about the time the </p>

<p> school becomes accustomed to D.A.R.E., the program is </p>

<p> discontinued and moved to another school). The </p>

<p> administrator reported that many school officials are </p>

<p> angry about this policy. </p>

<p> The police administrator also indicated the need </p>

<p> for more evaluation. He stated, &quot;Evaluation is the only </p>

<p> way to find out what works and what doesn't. I don't </p>

<p> think we're ever going to find that D.A.R.E. solves the </p>

<p> drug problem in the United States, but that it is a first </p>

<p> step. Evaluation must be written into everything. It </p>

<p> has taken too long for evaluations to come about.&quot; He </p>

<p> said that he would at least like to have information on </p>

<p> how effective the program is in suburban, rural, and </p>

<p> inner-city areas. He asked, &quot;If we find the program is </p>

<p> working in a certain area, that's great, but what can we </p>

<p> do in the other areas to enrich the program and diversify </p>

<p> it to meet those needs?&quot; =20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer mentioned several problems </p>

<p> areas. First, he indicated that although one of his </p>

<p> schools is heavily Hispanic, it does not have D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> books in Spanish. Second, he stated that the program was </p>

<p> designed for the officer to stay in contact with the </p>

<p> school and that in his current situation, he is in and </p>

<p> out of the school with little chance for further contact </p>

<p> with the students. Finally, he reported the need for </p>

<p> greater recognition of graduates of the program.=20 </p>

<p> &quot;Something should be done to get the parents and </p>

<p> principals more involved so that students feel they have </p>

<p> really accomplished something that has meaning.&quot; </p>

<p> The only problem mentioned by the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator was the need for a bilingual officer. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade </p>

<p> classroom of 25 students, composed of 6 Hispanics, 4 </p>

<p> African Americans, and 15 Caucasians. Two of the </p>

<p> students spoke limited English and needed translations of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lesson.=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. instructor was a white male police </p>

<p> officer in his forties who was dressed in regulation </p>

<p> uniform. The officer presented himself to the class as a </p>

<p> friend. The officer's teaching style was very </p>

<p> straightforward and &quot;streetwise,&quot; and he was both
gruff </p>

<p> and engaging. He was very knowledgeable about the </p>

<p> material and taught the whole lesson without notes. The </p>

<p> interaction between officer and students was an easy, </p>

<p> bantering one. </p>

<p> The 40-minute lesson that we observed focused on </p>

<p> the media and how advertisement can be used to persuade </p>

<p> consumers and children to purchase and use different </p>

<p> products. The lesson began with a short introductory </p>

<p> lecture on the influences of advertising and the goals of </p>

<p> the media. The officer then asked students questions </p>

<p> about different products to show them how much they have </p>

<p> learned from the media. The officer gave examples of </p>

<p> different types of advertisements (e.g., &quot;personal </p>

<p> testimony,&quot; &quot;bandwagon&quot;) and also used ads
from magazines </p>

<p> to illustrate his point. Most of the class period (30 </p>

<p> minutes) was spent in interaction. =20 </p>

<p> During the class, the students were rowdy but </p>

<p> attentive. They called out answers to the officer's </p>

<p> questions and felt free to make comments. The students </p>

<p> treated the officer with genuine respect. The interest </p>

<p> and interaction level in this particular lesson was high.=20 </p>

<p> The classroom teacher was present during the </p>

<p> lesson, leaving only once to go to the principal's </p>

<p> office. The teacher sat at the back of the room grading </p>

<p> papers; however, he had a D.A.R.E. book and followed the </p>

<p> lesson as it progressed. Most of the teacher's input </p>

<p> occurred in the beginning of the class before the lesson </p>

<p> got started. The only other time the teacher spoke was </p>

<p> to maintain discipline in the classroom, and then he only </p>

<p> reprimanded talkers. </p>

<p> Once the lesson was completed, the officer left </p>

<p> immediately. There was no evidence of any outside </p>

<p> contact with students. =20 </p>

<p> Urban School Without D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed two individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> school, the drug prevention coordinator for that school </p>

<p> district and the classroom teacher who taught the drug </p>

<p> prevention lesson that we observed. The following </p>

<p> summarizes the discussions with these individuals. </p>

<p> Administration. The drug prevention coordinator </p>

<p> reported that there is no specific drug prevention </p>

<p> program in place. She indicated that drug prevention </p>

<p> textbooks are used and, at times, individuals from </p>

<p> outside the school make presentations at drug prevention </p>

<p> assemblies. According to the coordinator, a teacher </p>

<p> might incorporate a drug prevention lesson into a reading </p>

<p> class or show a video. She stated, &quot;We put together lots
</p>

<p> of little things that add up to something you might call </p>

<p> a program, but we don't have a structured program.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Implementation. The coordinator indicated that </p>

<p> each student at the school receives drug education </p>

<p> information at least on a monthly basis. However, she </p>

<p> reported that lower grades receive less and in a more </p>

<p> loosely structured format. The teacher reported that he </p>

<p> makes sure his students receive some drug prevention </p>

<p> education every week. According to the coordinator, </p>

<p> classroom teachers do not have specific times set aside </p>

<p> for drug prevention, but rather fit it in when they can.=20 </p>

<p> The seventh and eighth graders do use and follow a drug </p>

<p> prevention textbook and have regular discussions. =20 </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that teachers' support </p>

<p> for the drug prevention program depended on which teacher </p>

<p> you were talking about. She indicated that all teachers </p>

<p> think that drug prevention education is important, but </p>

<p> that some are far more committed than others to </p>

<p> incorporating drug prevention lessons into their </p>

<p> curriculum. The classroom teacher stated that most of </p>

<p> his fellow teachers support the school's drug prevention </p>

<p> efforts, but that some teachers just did not know how to </p>

<p> talk to students about issues like drugs and gangs. He </p>

<p> stated, &quot;Some either don't know what to say or just
don't </p>

<p> care enough.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> The coordinator reported that law enforcement </p>

<p> personnel have been sporadically involved in the school's </p>

<p> drug prevention activities and have attended local school </p>

<p> council meetings and conducted in-service training with </p>

<p> teachers about drug awareness. She noted that 2 years </p>

<p> ago law enforcement officials came into the school to </p>

<p> work with students targeted as high risk. She stated </p>

<p> that &quot;the success of that program depended upon whether </p>

<p> or not the student accepted the officer.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> When we asked the coordinator about the involvement </p>

<p> of individuals from the community in the school's drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts, she responded that no person from the </p>

<p> community has been involved in implementing the school's </p>

<p> drug prevention program. She indicated that most of the </p>

<p> community has no idea about what the school is doing in </p>

<p> terms of drug prevention education. She stated, &quot;I don't
</p>

<p> think the community feels that it is their place to be </p>

<p> involved.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Funding. According to the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator, there were virtually no drug prevention </p>

<p> activities until the school began receiving money </p>

<p> specifically designated for drug prevention education </p>

<p> (DFSCA) about 3 or 4 years ago. She reported that the </p>

<p> school was currently in its third year of receiving DFSCA </p>

<p> funds and that the amount of funding had steadily </p>

<p> increased over those years. She noted, however, that </p>

<p> this funding cannot be counted on from year to year, and </p>

<p> it is difficult for the school to make long-term plans.=20 </p>

<p> According to the coordinator, the lack of resources </p>

<p> prevents consistency in the school's drug prevention </p>

<p> program. =20 </p>

<p> Curriculum. The drug prevention coordinator </p>

<p> indicated that although all drugs are covered by their </p>

<p> drug prevention efforts, alcohol is targeted. The </p>

<p> coordinator and the classroom teacher both reported that </p>

<p> alcohol is the most widely abused drug among children and </p>

<p> adults in their community. The teacher indicated that he </p>

<p> spends a great deal of time on this issue and that he </p>

<p> spends more time teaching students about self-esteem and </p>

<p> resisting peer pressure than teaching specifically about </p>

<p> drugs. The classroom teacher stated it is a mistake to </p>

<p> spend too much time educating students about the types of </p>

<p> drugs and their effects unless a strong foundation of </p>

<p> self-esteem has first been created. </p>

<p> When we asked whether the school drug prevention </p>

<p> program had been adapted to meet the needs of ethnic </p>

<p> minorities, the coordinator indicated that stereotypes </p>

<p> about who is on drugs and who is selling drugs are </p>

<p> reflected in the materials she has purchased; that is, </p>

<p> many of the pictures are of minorities. If anything, she </p>

<p> felt that white suburbs would have to work more with </p>

<p> adapting materials to fit their population. The </p>

<p> classroom teacher indicated that he was aware of the </p>

<p> cultural diversity in his school and addressed it on an </p>

<p> individual basis with students and their parents. The </p>

<p> teacher expressed frustration about the difficulty of </p>

<p> teaching drug prevention when many of the students live </p>

<p> in homes where the norm is to &quot;drink heavily and abuse </p>

<p> family members.&quot; =20 </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator said that in the future she would like to </p>

<p> purchase a packaged curriculum=FEpossibly D.A.R.E. She </p>

<p> indicated that she did not know very much about D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> but would like information about how to get the program.=20 </p>

<p> One negative factor she reported having heard about </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is that there is a long waiting list for the </p>

<p> program. She stated, &quot;When you first called and asked if
</p>

<p> we had D.A.R.E., I got excited and thought that someone </p>

<p> was going to give us D.A.R.E.; I don't really know what </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is, but I assume that because it is in other </p>

<p> schools, it is good.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> The drug prevention coordinator also indicated that </p>

<p> she would like to increase the amount and consistency of </p>

<p> delivery of the drug prevention education program, and to </p>

<p> bring greater structure to. The coordinator and the </p>

<p> classroom teacher both reported that they want to have </p>

<p> the drug prevention program administered by one person </p>

<p> who would come in and take responsibility for the </p>

<p> program. =20 </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a special </p>

<p> education class of 22 students. It was a remedial class </p>

<p> comprising 14 Hispanics, 6 African Americans, and 2 </p>

<p> Caucasians. There were 12 girls and 10 boys. =20 </p>

<p> The teacher was a white man in his forties, dressed </p>

<p> in a suit and tie. He encouraged the students and drew </p>

<p> on their strengths. He often called on students who </p>

<p> would not otherwise volunteer answers and helped them </p>

<p> formulate answers. When an answer was not exactly </p>

<p> correct, he encouraged the student to think further about </p>

<p> the question asked. The teacher carefully and adequately </p>

<p> answered students' questions. </p>

<p> The topic of the observed lesson concerned the </p>

<p> functioning of the lung and heart. This was a lesson </p>

<p> designed to provide students with background information </p>

<p> about the human body, before the impact of drugs on the </p>

<p> body's major organs were discussed. The teacher followed </p>

<p> the textbook closely. Because the students were slow </p>

<p> learners, he altered the lesson slightly by asking the </p>

<p> students to read sections aloud and then immediately </p>

<p> asking questions about the section just covered. Most </p>

<p> students appeared interested in the lesson. They </p>

<p> followed along in the textbook and answered questions </p>

<p> with sincerity. A few students consistently put their </p>

<p> hands up to answer questions, but most were quiet. There </p>

<p> were no discipline problems during the class. After </p>

<p> class, we asked the teacher whether he ever used group </p>

<p> discussions. He reported that this group of students was </p>

<p> too remedial to use a discussion format. =20 </p>

<p> Rural Schools </p>

<p> Rural School with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. program in the rural district employed </p>

<p> four D.A.R.E. officers. We interviewed five individuals, </p>

<p> including: </p>

<p> o the police administrator in charge of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. program, </p>

<p> o a D.A.R.E. officer, </p>

<p> o the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator, </p>

<p> o the school guidance counselor, and </p>

<p> o the teacher in whose class the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer taught. </p>

<p> The following summarizes our discussions with these </p>

<p> respondents. </p>

<p> Administration. The police administrator indicated </p>

<p> that the D.A.R.E. program was administered by the city </p>

<p> police department. He reported that this was the first </p>

<p> semester that D.A.R.E. had been offered in this </p>

<p> particular school. He stated that the agreement between </p>

<p> the school and police department is informal. </p>

<p> Implementation. The police administrator reported </p>

<p> that the initial steps in implementing the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program include selection of a D.A.R.E. officer by the </p>

<p> local police department, approval of the officer by the </p>

<p> State police, and training for the officer at a D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> training course. </p>

<p> The officer reported that there are no problems </p>

<p> coordinating D.A.R.E. activities. He stated that there </p>

<p> is &quot;eagerness from all sides to make the program
work.&quot;=20 </p>

<p> According to the officer, some classroom teachers </p>

<p> participate in the lesson, but most do not. He further </p>

<p> indicated that much of the time students are just as </p>

<p> receptive without the teacher present. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer indicated that parents are </p>

<p> becoming more involved in the program. He stated that </p>

<p> they are very interested and supportive of D.A.R.E., and </p>

<p> that his attendance at nonclassroom school functions, </p>

<p> such as Friday night dances, has greatly improved his </p>

<p> relationships with parents. He reported that he hopes to </p>

<p> receive training on the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum as </p>

<p> soon as possible. </p>

<p> According to the officer and the police </p>

<p> administrator, there was little community involvement.=20 </p>

<p> They attributed this to the program being new and hoped </p>

<p> that there would be more community involvement in the </p>

<p> coming semesters. However, the coordinator did report </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. is well received by the &quot;educated&quot; </p>

<p> community. He indicated that churches in the community </p>

<p> have not been particularly receptive and simply do not </p>

<p> want to get involved. The coordinator and the guidance </p>

<p> counselor saw the lack of involvement by churches as a </p>

<p> loss to the program. </p>

<p> According to the school counselor, students' </p>

<p> attitudes toward police had changed considerably since </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. lessons began. She stated that &quot;students </p>

<p> now see the officer as a friend instead of someone to </p>

<p> avoid.&quot; </p>

<p> Funding. The police administrator reported that </p>

<p> the police department funds the salary of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer, while the school pays any costs for the </p>

<p> curriculum (i.e., books, materials). The school district </p>

<p> coordinator indicated that the school did not have the </p>

<p> funds to purchase D.A.R.E. T-shirts and related </p>

<p> paraphernalia. He further stated that the district is </p>

<p> seeking a State grant for additional supplies. </p>

<p> Curriculum. The guidance counselor reported that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. classes are a &quot;wonderful way of teaching </p>

<p> students to say no&quot; and that the self-esteem modules are
</p>

<p> particularly valuable and effective. According to the </p>

<p> district coordinator, D.A.R.E. complements all their </p>

<p> other drug prevention programs, but that unfortunately </p>

<p> there was little coordination between different </p>

<p> curricula.=20 </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer reported that he does not </p>

<p> target the curriculum to any particular substances and </p>

<p> does not adapt the curriculum to specific ethnic needs.=20 </p>

<p> He indicated that he does teach the gang lesson (as do </p>

<p> most D.A.R.E. officers in the State), even though in this </p>

<p> community there is little gang activity. </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. The guidance counselor </p>

<p> indicated that she would like the school to provide </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in all classrooms in grades 5 through 7. The </p>

<p> guidance counselor and the classroom teacher indicated </p>

<p> the need for the school to offer D.A.R.E. or some other </p>

<p> drug prevention education at earlier grade levels.=20 </p>

<p> According to the counselor, &quot;Trying to teach drug </p>

<p> prevention education in high school is futile.&quot; </p>

<p> The classroom teacher indicated that D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other programs need to focus more on at-risk children.=20 </p>

<p> She indicated that there are some 15- and 16-year-olds </p>

<p> still in the 6th grade. She reported that these students </p>

<p> usually have poor attendance records, are poorly </p>

<p> motivated, and are frequently in trouble. She stated </p>

<p> that current prevention programs, including D.A.R.E., are </p>

<p> not adequately meeting the needs of these students.=20 </p>

<p> The district coordinator indicated that one problem </p>

<p> has been the lack of ongoing evaluations of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a fifth-grade </p>

<p> class of 22 students, 12 boys and 10 girls. Twenty </p>

<p> students were African American, and two students were </p>

<p> Caucasian. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. officer was a white man in his </p>

<p> thirties who was dressed in regulation uniform. The </p>

<p> officer presented himself as a &quot;big brother,&quot;
someone </p>

<p> whom the students could seek out if they needed guidance </p>

<p> or assistance. The officer brought the D.A.R.E. mascot-- </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. bear--with him to class. </p>

<p> The lesson that we observed focused on alternatives </p>

<p> to drug use. The officer discussed how athletics could </p>

<p> be used as an alternative to drug involvement. He used </p>

<p> examples of well-known, drug-free athletes. The officer </p>

<p> encouraged students to ask questions. He also used a </p>

<p> &quot;D.A.R.E. question box.&quot; In the previous week,
students </p>

<p> had been asked to write questions for the officer and </p>

<p> place them in the box. During the lesson, he drew a </p>

<p> question from the box and answered that question. For </p>

<p> the remainder of the lesson, the officer took the </p>

<p> students outside to play games to illustrate alternatives </p>

<p> to drug use. He also involved the school's gym teacher </p>

<p> in supervising the games. </p>

<p> During the class, students were interested and </p>

<p> inquisitive. They seemed to feel free to ask the officer </p>

<p> questions. There were no disciplinary problems. The </p>

<p> classroom teacher remained present during most of the </p>

<p> lesson, sitting at the back of the room and grading </p>

<p> papers. =20 </p>

<p> The officer seemed to spend a great deal of time in </p>

<p> the school. After the lesson was over, he talked to </p>

<p> students in the hallway. Indeed, almost all students </p>

<p> seemed to know him. When an emergency occurred (a </p>

<p> student fell and broke his arm) and the principal was not </p>

<p> present, the staff sought the officer's assistance. This </p>

<p> was not the first such occurrence, and we learned that </p>

<p> the school staff relied frequently upon the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officer to act as a sort of assistant principal.=20 </p>

<p> Clearly, he was viewed as an integral--and important-- </p>

<p> part of the school staff. </p>

<p> Rural School Without D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> We interviewed four individuals at the non-D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> school, including the school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinator (who was the same for both rural schools), </p>

<p> the supervisor of health services, and two members of a </p>

<p> local advisory board for substance abuse. The following </p>

<p> summarizes discussions with these individuals. </p>

<p> Administration. Coordination of the drug </p>

<p> prevention efforts in the observed non-D.A.R.E. school </p>

<p> and other such schools in the community rests with the </p>

<p> school district drug prevention coordinator. He </p>

<p> indicated that there are a variety of programs currently </p>

<p> available to schools but that implementation and </p>

<p> coordination are sporadic. </p>

<p> Implementation. According to the coordinator, </p>

<p> parents in this school are becoming more aware of the </p>

<p> drug problem and are beginning to ask what they can do to </p>

<p> get involved. He stated that many parents are realizing </p>

<p> that they cannot &quot;send their kids to school to get </p>

<p> fixed,&quot; and so are starting to take responsibility for </p>

<p> their children's problems. He also indicated that school </p>

<p> personnel are becoming more involved.=20 </p>

<p> Funding. According to the district coordinator, </p>

<p> the school receives most of its drug prevention funds </p>

<p> from DFSCA. He also indicated funds were provided by the </p>

<p> school board and a local university, as well as the </p>

<p> Indian Education Act. These latter resources, however, </p>

<p> could only be spent on programs delivered to Native </p>

<p> American children. </p>

<p> Curriculum. According to the coordinator, a </p>

<p> variety of curricula are available to teachers at this </p>

<p> school, but not all teachers use the same curriculum, and </p>

<p> some do not provide drug prevention education at all.=20 </p>

<p> The coordinator reported that Here's Looking at You 2000 </p>

<p> is one package available to teachers in this school.=20 </p>

<p> However, he indicated that only about half the teachers </p>

<p> had been trained to teach this program. </p>

<p> The advisory board members informed us of a </p>

<p> community drug abuse treatment program currently in use </p>

<p> in this and other area schools that follows the
&quot;12-step&quot; </p>

<p> model. This program offers intervention, education, and </p>

<p> prevention to youth who have been suspended for substance </p>

<p> use, as well as to their families. One board member </p>

<p> stated that suspended youth must attend this program </p>

<p> before returning to school. </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that the SAP is just now </p>

<p> being implemented in this school. </p>

<p> The health supervisor reported that the school also </p>

<p> sponsors Red Ribbon week, a program sponsored by the </p>

<p> National Federation of Parents that invites youth and </p>

<p> community members to pledge their support for drug-free </p>

<p> lives by displaying red ribbons. </p>

<p> Problems and Improvements. All individuals </p>

<p> interviewed indicated the need for greater coordination </p>

<p> between the different types of drug prevention programs, </p>

<p> as well as assessments of drug prevention efforts. The </p>

<p> coordinator reported that he would like to have someone </p>

<p> responsible for the delivery of drug prevention programs </p>

<p> in the school and someone responsible for evaluation. He </p>

<p> said that &quot;a lot of people are working very hard, but </p>

<p> have little idea of whether or not their efforts are </p>

<p> successful.&quot; </p>

<p> The coordinator indicated that time is also a major </p>

<p> problem in the delivery of drug prevention education. He </p>

<p> stated that preparing students for end of the year </p>

<p> testing takes up most of the classroom teachers' time and </p>

<p> allows them little time to teach drug prevention. </p>

<p> Classroom Observation. We observed a 5th grade </p>

<p> class of three girls and seven boys. This was a class </p>

<p> for exceptional children that included students with </p>

<p> emotional and behavioral problems. Five of the students </p>

<p> were Caucasian, three were African-American, and two were </p>

<p> Native American. </p>

<p> The instructor was an African-American woman in her </p>

<p> twenties. She used an approachable and upbeat teaching </p>

<p> style. She was careful to include all of the students in </p>

<p> the lesson. </p>

<p> Because this was a class for exceptional children, </p>

<p> the teacher tailored the drug lesson to the students.=20 </p>

<p> The teacher drew her lesson from health textbooks used in </p>

<p> regular classes. The lesson lasted approximately 1 hour.=20 </p>

<p> The teacher indicated that the length of the class and </p>

<p> how much time she spends on the drug lesson generally </p>

<p> depends both on her assessment of how much of the lesson </p>

<p> the students are absorbing and their interest level. She </p>

<p> indicated that drug prevention lessons are usually taught </p>

<p> two or three times a week. </p>

<p> The observed lesson was about learning how to make </p>

<p> healthy choices. Topics included why people smoke and </p>

<p> use drugs, how magazine advertisements promote smoking </p>

<p> and drinking, and the differences between drugs that are </p>

<p> helpful and harmful. The teacher covered a wide range of </p>

<p> concepts, including how self-esteem and peer pressure </p>

<p> contribute to drug use, the importance of reading warning </p>

<p> labels on medications, and techniques advertisements use </p>

<p> to glamorize drug use. The class format was primarily </p>

<p> question and answer, and the teacher encouraged each </p>

<p> student to participate. The teacher used a variety of </p>

<p> visual aids, including charts, examples of magazine ads, </p>

<p> and a collection of common medications that can be </p>

<p> inappropriately used. </p>

<p> For the most part, the students were very </p>

<p> attentive. Most were eager to be called on and to </p>

<p> participate in the class. The teacher encouraged </p>

<p> participation by all the students. </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> This chapter focused on site visits to four schools </p>

<p> in three school districts. Two of the schools were </p>

<p> located in one rural school district; one of these </p>

<p> schools had D.A.R.E. and one did not. The other two </p>

<p> schools were located in adjacent school districts in an </p>

<p> urban area; again, one school had D.A.R.E. and one did </p>

<p> not. </p>

<p> In both of the schools with D.A.R.E., limited </p>

<p> participation of teachers, parents, and the community </p>

<p> were reported. Both schools also mentioned having </p>

<p> inadequate resources for the program. Neither school </p>

<p> reported adapting the curriculum for any reason. In both </p>

<p> schools, the need for ongoing, long-term evaluations was </p>

<p> stressed. </p>

<p> Neither of the non-D.A.R.E. schools had a specific </p>

<p> drug prevention program. Both reported that </p>

<p> implementation and coordination was sporadic. Both </p>

<p> schools reported wanting one person who would be </p>

<p> responsible for administering the drug prevention program </p>

<p> in the school. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 7 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. OUTCOME ASSESSMENT </p>

<p> Project D.A.R.E. is a drug use prevention program </p>

<p> with curricula targeted at elementary, middle, and senior </p>

<p> high school students. The original core curriculum used </p>

<p> in elementary schools is the subject of this review (a </p>

<p> revised core curriculum will be implemented in September </p>

<p> 1994). The junior and senior high school curricula are </p>

<p> not included in the review because they are more recent, </p>

<p> not as prevalent, and generally have not been evaluated.=20 </p>

<p> Future evaluation efforts should focus on these </p>

<p> curricula, as well as on the cumulative effects of the </p>

<p> comprehensive program. </p>

<p> The purpose of the current review is to assess the </p>

<p> short-term effectiveness of the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum by using meta-analytic techniques to </p>

<p> synthesize the evaluation findings of several studies.=20 </p>

<p> We searched for all D.A.R.E. evaluations, both published </p>

<p> and unpublished, conducted over the past 10 years (i.e., </p>

<p> since D.A.R.E. originated) and selected for further </p>

<p> review those studies that met specified methodological </p>

<p> criteria. To establish a comparable measure of </p>

<p> effectiveness across studies, we calculated effect sizes </p>

<p> for each study. In addition, to put D.A.R.E. in the </p>

<p> context of other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, we compared the average magnitude of the effect </p>

<p> sizes for D.A.R.E. with those of other programs that </p>

<p> target youth of similar age. </p>

<p> This chapter covers six topics. First, we briefly </p>

<p> summarize the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Second, </p>

<p> we provide some general background on meta-analysis and </p>

<p> describe the methodological criteria used to select </p>

<p> evaluations for the review. Third, we identify the eight </p>

<p> studies that met the criteria and provide an overall </p>

<p> description of these studies. Fourth, we examine the </p>

<p> reported immediate effects of D.A.R.E., based on these </p>

<p> studies. Fifth, we compare the D.A.R.E. effect sizes </p>

<p> averaged across studies with the average effect sizes of </p>

<p> other drug use prevention programs. Finally, we discuss </p>

<p> several methodological considerations related to the </p>

<p> evaluations included in our review that are important to </p>

<p> interpretation of the results. Further discussion of the </p>

<p> results is included in Chapter 8 of this report. </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. Core Curriculum </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. core curriculum is offered to pupils </p>

<p> in the last year of elementary school, typically fifth or </p>

<p> sixth grade. The 17 lessons in the core curriculum are </p>

<p> usually offered once a week for 45 to 60 minutes. The </p>

<p> lessons focus on teaching pupils the skills they need in </p>

<p> order to recognize and resist social pressures to use </p>

<p> drugs. In addition to information about drugs, lessons </p>

<p> emphasize decisionmaking skills, building self-esteem, </p>

<p> and choosing healthy alternatives to drug use. Officers </p>

<p> use a variety of teaching methods, including lectures, </p>

<p> group discussions, question-and-answer sessions, </p>

<p> audiovisual materials, workbook exercises, and role- </p>

<p> plays. </p>

<p> Several aspects of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> suggest that it should be successful as a drug use </p>

<p> prevention curriculum. First, the curriculum includes </p>

<p> elements of prevention strategies generally thought to be </p>

<p> effective, such as emphasis on peer resistance and social </p>

<p> competence skills (Botvin, 1990; Hansen, 1992). Interac- </p>

<p> tive programs have shown more promise than those using </p>

<p> more traditional teaching methods (Tobler, 1986, in </p>

<p> press, 1994), and at least some of D.A.R.E.'s teaching </p>

<p> strategies encourage role-playing and interactions among </p>

<p> pupils. Also, the core curriculum is offered to children </p>

<p> at the age when they are believed to be most receptive to </p>

<p> antidrug use messages, which is just before experimenta- </p>

<p> tion with drugs begins (BJA, 1988; Oetting &amp; Bauvais, </p>

<p> 1990). In addition, the program targets cigarettes, </p>

<p> alcohol, and marijuana--the &quot;gateway drugs&quot; that
children </p>

<p> tend to experiment with first (Ellickson, Hays, &amp; Bell, </p>

<p> 1992; Kandel, 1975). Finally, the structured nature of </p>

<p> the curriculum and extensive training of the officers </p>

<p> helps ensure that the program is implemented as designed </p>

<p> (BJA, 1988). </p>

<p> Meta-Analysis Background and Study Selection Criteria </p>

<p> Meta-analysis is a methodology for integrating the </p>

<p> research findings of a body of studies (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1986; Cook et al., 1993). The purpose of meta-analysis </p>

<p> is to discover whether some pattern of results is </p>

<p> discernible in a set of studies pertaining to the same </p>

<p> research question (Bangert-Drowns, 1986; Glass, McGaw, &amp; </p>

<p> Smith, 1981; Rosenthal, 1991). Meta-analysis differs </p>

<p> from a traditional narrative review of studies by </p>

<p> providing statistical techniques for summarizing the </p>

<p> research findings from the studies. By quantifying </p>

<p> outcomes across studies and making them comparable with </p>

<p> each other, meta-analysis provides an objective rather </p>

<p> than subjective basis for drawing conclusions about </p>

<p> patterns of study results. </p>

<p> Three basic steps are commonly followed in </p>

<p> conducting meta-analyses (Bangert-Drowns, 1986). First, </p>

<p> all relevant studies are collected, and some studies are </p>

<p> selected for inclusion according to a set of a priori </p>

<p> defined methodological criteria. Second, effect sizes </p>

<p> are calculated for each study. Effect sizes represent </p>

<p> the statistical outcomes of each study transformed to a </p>

<p> common metric. This transformation allows comparisons </p>

<p> across different scales of different outcome measures.=20 </p>

<p> Third, effect sizes for the set of studies are averaged.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, explanations for variability in effect sizes </p>

<p> across studies usually are tested. We followed these </p>

<p> three steps in conducting our assessment of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum; we did not, however, examine possible </p>

<p> causes of differences in outcomes across the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies (e.g., differences in D.A.R.E. outcomes by the </p>

<p> racial/ethnic composition of the study samples). The </p>

<p> relatively small number of D.A.R.E. studies precluded </p>

<p> this type of analysis. </p>

<p> In selecting studies, our review focused on </p>

<p> student-based, quantitative evaluations of D.A.R.E. that </p>

<p> measured program effects on drug use behavior and/or </p>

<p> other outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, </p>

<p> such as attitudes about drug use. Evaluations that </p>

<p> reported only subjective assessments or satisfaction </p>

<p> ratings are outside the scope of this review. We also </p>

<p> did not consider the results of parent, teacher, </p>

<p> administrator, or D.A.R.E. officer surveys, which </p>

<p> sometimes were conducted as part of the total evaluation </p>

<p> effort. (For information about the opinions of school </p>

<p> district drug prevention coordinators concerning </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., see Chapter 5.) It should be noted that there </p>

<p> are many possible D.A.R.E. outcomes of importance other </p>

<p> than the ones we examined in this meta-analysis, such as </p>

<p> improved school and police relations and greater trust in </p>

<p> law enforcement among youth. </p>

<p> We attempted to locate all the quantitative </p>

<p> evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> conducted to date through a survey of D.A.R.E.'s five </p>

<p> RTCs, telephone interviews with individuals known to be </p>

<p> involved with D.A.R.E., and computerized searches of the </p>

<p> published and unpublished literature using several data </p>

<p> bases. The computerized data bases included ERIC, </p>

<p> PsychINFO, and Dissertation Abstracts Online.=20 </p>

<p> Through the combined sources, we identified 18 </p>

<p> quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluations conducted in 12 States </p>

<p> and one Canadian province. The location and primary </p>

<p> reference for each evaluation are shown in Exhibit 7.1.=20 </p>

<p> Several of the evaluations were reported in multiple </p>

<p> reports or papers; we generally used the final, most </p>

<p> complete report or the published paper for our review. </p>

<p> From the 18 studies, we selected studies to include </p>

<p> in our meta-analysis that met the following criteria:=20 </p>

<p> (a) use of a control or comparison group; (b) pretest- </p>

<p> posttest design or posttest only with random assignment; </p>

<p> and (c) use of reliably operationalized quantitative </p>

<p> outcome measures. Quasi-experimental studies were </p>

<p> excluded if they did not control for preexisting </p>

<p> differences on measured outcomes with either change </p>

<p> scores or covariance adjusted means (Tobler, in press, </p>

<p> 1994). In addition, to ensure the comparability of </p>

<p> results, we used only results based on immediate </p>

<p> posttest. There were an insufficient number of long-term </p>

<p> evaluation studies to adequately assess the longer-term </p>

<p> effects of the core curriculum. </p>

<p> We selected these criteria because they help to </p>

<p> ensure confidence in the study results by removing a </p>

<p> number of alternative explanations, other than true </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. impact, that could account for outcomes </p>

<p> observed. For example, the first criterion, a comparison </p>

<p> group made up of schools and/or subjects that did not </p>

<p> receive the curriculum, makes it possible to determine </p>

<p> whether changes in the D.A.R.E. youth are unique to them </p>

<p> or are shared by other youth. If youth receiving and not </p>

<p> receiving D.A.R.E. change on some outcome of interest, </p>

<p> then the cause is due to some other factor, such as </p>

<p> maturation, rather than to D.A.R.E. Pretest measures </p>

<p> (the second criterion) are neededExhibit 7.1 D.A.R.E.

<p> *Study selected for further review (with State </p>

<p> for testing the assumption that the D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison groups are equivalent at the outset. In the </p>

<p> absence of random assignment, this assumption must be </p>

<p> tested. In addition, pretest measures provide a </p>

<p> benchmark for evaluating changes in outcome measures </p>

<p> after program implementation. Reliably operationalized </p>

<p> measures of the outcomes of interest (the third </p>

<p> criterion) are important for ensuring that the constructs </p>

<p> intended to be measured are the ones actually measured.=20 </p>

<p> For example, for assessing outcomes related to knowledge, </p>

<p> attitudes, and skills, we considered multiple item scales </p>

<p> to be more reliable than single-item measures. </p>

<p> We also examined a number of other methodological </p>

<p> features, such as the correspondence between the unit of </p>

<p> assignment and unit of analysis, whether a panel design </p>

<p> was used, whether schools in the intervention and </p>

<p> comparison conditions were matched, and whether attrition </p>

<p> rates were reported and examined. Although these factors </p>

<p> were considered in assessing the overall methodological </p>

<p> rigor of the studies, no evaluations were eliminated on </p>

<p> the basis of these criteria. </p>

<p> Studies Selected </p>

<p> Eight of the original 18 evaluation studies met the </p>

<p> criteria for inclusion in the review. One additional </p>

<p> study met the methodological criteria but did not </p>

<p> administer the first posttest until 1 year after D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> implementation and so could not be included in the </p>

<p> analysis of immediate effects (Nyre &amp; Rose, 1987; Nyre, </p>

<p> Rose, &amp; Bolus, 1987). The eight evaluations are </p>

<p> indicated by an asterisk (*) in Exhibit 7.1.=20 </p>

<p> Characteristics of the studies are summarized in Exhibit </p>

<p> 7.2. A more complete description of each study is </p>

<p> provided in Appendix B. </p>

<p> Each of the evaluations represented a State or </p>

<p> local (e.g., city, school district) effort using either </p>

<p> the entire population of schools in a locale or a </p>

<p> convenience sample. The number of student subjects in </p>

<p> all studies was large; each study included at least 10 </p>

<p> schools and approximately 500 to 2000 students in the </p>

<p> combined D.A.R.E. and control groups. Demographic </p>

<p> information about each sample, including gender, </p>

<p> race/ethnicity, SES, and metropolitan status, was not </p>

<p> consistently given across studies. Based on the </p>

<p> information available, the samples were about equally </p>

<p> divided between girls and boys; included white, </p>

<p> black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian-American </p>

<p> youth, with whites usually in the majority; and </p>

<p> represented urban, suburban, and rural areas.=20 </p>

<p> Information was generally not given on the SES of the </p>

<p> sample. </p>

<p> Assignment of D.A.R.E. to intervention and control </p>

<p> groups was by school for all eight studies. In one </p>

<p> study, D.A.R.E. was also assigned by classroom in certain </p>

<p> schools (Manos et al., 1986). Because the control group </p>

<p> classrooms in that study were potentially contaminated by </p>

<p> their close proximity to D.A.R.E. classrooms, these </p>

<p> control classrooms were eliminated; only control schools </p>

<p> with no D.A.R.E. classes were included. Two of the </p>

<p> studies used a true experimental design in which schools </p>

<p> were randomly assigned to D.A.R.E. or control conditions; </p>

<p> a third study used random assignment for two-thirds of </p>

<p> the schools. The remaining five evaluations used a </p>

<p> nonequivalent control group quasi-experimental design.=20 </p>

<p> For these, assignment was based on some other criterion; </p>

<p> if the criterion was stated, usually it was the </p>

<p> administrative convenience of either the school district </p>

<p> or law enforcement agency.=20 </p>

<p> A fundamental consideration in reviewing the </p>

<p> studies was the equivalence of the D.A.R.E. and control </p>

<p> groups before the intervention. Because there were </p>

<p> relatively few sampling units across studies (ranging </p>

<p> from 11 to 63 schools, with under 40 schools in all </p>

<p> except one study), it is unlikely that equivalence </p>

<p> between groups was obtained without prior matching or </p>

<p> blocking of schools, even with randomization. Only half </p>

<p> the studies matched comparison schools on selected </p>

<p> demographic characteristics. The majority of studies </p>

<p> (75%), however, assessed the equivalency of the </p>

<p> comparison groups at pretest and made adjustments for </p>

<p> pretest differences on demographic characteristics. All </p>

<p> studies adjusted for pretest differences on outcome </p>

<p> measures. </p>

used a pan= </p>

<p> el </p>

<p> design that </p>

<p> matched subjects from pretest to posttest using a unique </p>

<p> identification code. </p>

<p> Outcome measures used in the studies were based on </p>

<p> responses to self-administered questionnaires. Seven of </p>

<p> the eight studies used measures that were standardized </p>

<p> scales or derived from existing measures; six studies </p>

<p> reported scale reliabilities (usually Cronbach's alpha) </p>

<p> that were generally high. Validity information, however, </p>

<p> was rarely reported, and none of the studies used either </p>

<p> a biochemical indicator or &quot;bogus pipeline&quot;
technique to </p>

<p> validate self-reports of drug use. Informing youth that </p>

<p> their self-reports of drug use will be verified by a </p>

<p> biological specimen (e.g., saliva) or a purported lie </p>

<p> detector (i.e., bogus pipeline) is believed to enhance </p>

<p> the validity of their responses (Bauman &amp; Dent, 1982). </p>

<p> As is unfortunately typical of school-based </p>

<p> evaluation studies, most (75%) of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations did not use a data analysis strategy </p>

<p> appropriate to the unit of assignment. Because schools, </p>

<p> not students, were assigned to D.A.R.E. and control </p>

<p> conditions, it would have been appropriate to analyze the </p>

<p> data by schools with subjects' data aggregated within </p>

<p> each school or to use an analysis strategy that accounts </p>

<p> for clustered data (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray &amp; Hannan, </p>

<p> 1990). Six of the studies ignored schools altogether and </p>

<p> analyzed individual subjects' data, thereby violating the </p>

<p> statistical assumption of independence of observations.=20 </p>

<p> The result of ignoring schools as the unit of analysis is </p>

<p> a positive bias toward finding statistically significant </p>

<p> program effects (Murray &amp; Hannan, 1990). </p>

<p> Five of the studies reported attrition rates, which </p>

<p> generally were small. None of the three studies that </p>

<p> analyzed attrition rates found that attrition differed </p>

<p> significantly across experimental and control conditions.=20 </p>

<p> In addition, subjects absent from the posttest were not </p>

<p> more likely to be drug users or at risk for drug use.=20 </p>

<p> Although attrition usually is greater among drug users </p>

<p> (Biglan &amp; Ary, 1985), given the young age of the sample, </p>

<p> when dropping out of school is unlikely and drug use </p>

<p> prevalence is low, these results are not surprising. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Effect Sizes </p>

<p> To assess the impact of the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum on youth drug use, as well as on other </p>

<p> outcomes targeted by the curriculum, we calculated effect </p>

<p> sizes. An effect size (ES) is defined as the difference </p>

<p> between the mean for the intervention group (MeanI) and </p>

<p> the mean for the control group (MeanC), standardized by </p>

<p> dividing by the pooled standard deviation (SD): [ES =3D </p>

<p> (MeanI - MeanC)/ SD] (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985; Perry &amp; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1992; Rosenthal, 1991). If means and standard </p>

<p> deviations are not available, effect sizes can be </p>

<p> calculated using formulae developed to convert other test </p>

<p> statistics (such as, t or F), as well as percentages, to </p>

<p> effect sizes (Perry &amp; Tobler, 1992). </p>

<p> Effect sizes are expressed as standard deviation </p>

<p> units and may be positive or negative. A positive effect </p>

<p> size indicates an effect in the desired direction as a </p>

<p> result of the intervention. An effect size of 1, for </p>

<p> example, indicates that the intervention group performed </p>

<p> one standard deviation unit better than the control group </p>

<p> on some outcome of interest. Although there are no clear </p>

<p> conventions for defining &quot;small,&quot;
&quot;medium,&quot; and &quot;large&quot; </p>

<p> effect sizes in the context of drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, review of several meta-analyses of adolescent </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; </p>

<p> Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, 1986, in </p>

<p> press, 1992 ) suggests that effect sizes below .15 </p>

<p> reflect a small effect; effect sizes between .15 and .30 </p>

<p> indicate a modest effect; and effect sizes above .30 </p>

<p> reflect stronger program effects. </p>

<p> For each of the eight D.A.R.E. studies, we </p>

<p> calculated effect sizes to quantify the magnitude of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to six outcomes </p>

<p> that reflect the aims of the D.A.R.E. curriculum. The </p>

<p> six outcomes were knowledge about drugs, attitudes about </p>

<p> drug use, social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward </p>

<p> police, and self-reported drug use. We calculated effect </p>

<p> sizes using the procedure appropriate for the summary </p>

<p> statistics reported. In all cases, we used statistics </p>

<p> reflecting covariance-adjusted means, with pretest values </p>

<p> as covariates, rather than unadjusted means so that any </p>

<p> differences between the comparison groups prior to the </p>

<p> intervention would not be reflected in the effect sizes </p>

<p> (Tobler, in press, 1994). Where possible, we used </p>

<p> statistics that also were adjusted for sample demographic </p>

<p> characteristics (six of eight studies). </p>

<p> Some studies did not include all six outcomes of </p>

<p> interest, and some outcomes were measured by more than </p>

<p> one indicator. When multiple indicators were used, such </p>

<p> as two measures of social skills, we calculated separate </p>

<p> effect sizes and then averaged them. This procedure </p>

<p> yielded one effect size per study for each type of </p>

<p> measured outcome. In the one study that reported only </p>

<p> that a measured outcome was not statistically significant </p>

<p> and did not provide any further statistics, we assigned a </p>

<p> value of zero to that effect size. To calculate effect </p>

<p> sizes for reported drug use, we considered only alcohol, </p>

<p> tobacco, and marijuana use; we averaged effect sizes </p>

<p> across these substances. In a supplementary analysis, we </p>

<p> also considered use of these substances separately. Use </p>

<p> of other drugs, such as cocaine, was measured by some </p>

<p> studies, but the prevalence of use was too small to </p>

<p> produce meaningful effects. </p>

<p> The unweighted effect sizes at immediate posttest </p>

<p> for each outcome for each study are shown in Exhibit 7.3.=20 </p>

<p> Several of the effect sizes are .30 or higher, although </p>

<p> most are less than .20. The largest effect sizes are for </p>

<p> knowledge (that was only measured by three of the eight </p>

<p> studies) and social skills. The effect sizes for self- </p>

<p> esteem, attitudes about drug use, and attitude toward </p>

<p> police tend to be smaller. The smallest effect sizes are </p>

<p> for drug use, with none being greater than .11. The </p>

<p> higher effect sizes for knowledge compared with drug use </p>

<p> is consistent with other studies and supports the </p>

<p> conclusion that knowledge is easier to change than </p>

<p> behavior (Bangert-Drowns, 1988; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986). </p>

<p> In addition to calculating one effect size for each </p>

<p> outcome for each study, we calculated the weighted mean </p>

<p> effect size and 95% confidence interval for each type of </p>

<p> outcome across the eight studies. The weighted mean </p>

<p> provides a summary measure across the eight studies that </p>

<p> is useful for indicating D.A.R.E.'s general effectiveness </p>

<p> with respect to each outcome. The weighted mean provides </p>

<p> a less biased estimate than the simple unweighted mean </p>

<p> because estimates from larger samples are given more </p>

<p> weight. It is computed by weighting each effect size by </p>

<p> the inverse of its variance, which is a reflection of the </p>

<p> sample size (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985). The effect size </p>

<p> estimates from larger studies are generally more precise </p>

<p> than those from smaller studies (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985). </p>

<p> The 95% confidence interval provides an upper and </p>

<p> lower bound for the estimate; in 95% of samples drawn, </p>

<p> the estimate would fall within these bounds. To </p>

<p> calculate the 95% confidence interval, 1.96 multiplied by </p>

<p> the square root of one divided by the sum of the study </p>

<p> weights is added to or subtracted from the mean (Hedges &amp;
</p>

<p> Olkin, 1985). </p>

<p> The weighted mean effect size at immediate posttest </p>

<p> and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome are </p>

<p> depicted in Exhibit 7.4. The largest weighted mean </p>

<p> effect size is for knowledge about drugs (0.42), followed </p>

<p> by social skills (0.19), attitude toward police (0.13), </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use (0.11), self-esteem (0.06), and </p>

<p> drug use (0.06). The weighted mean effect sizes for </p>

<p> knowledge, social skills, attitude toward police, </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use, and self-esteem are </p>

<p> statistically significant. The statistical significance </p>

<p> of these D.A.R.E. effect sizes, however, should be </p>

<p> interpreted cautiously because the significance may be </p>

<p> positively influenced by the failure of most studies to </p>

<p> account for data Exhibit 7.4 Magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s Weighted
Mean </p>

<p> Effect Size (and 95% Confidence </p>

<p> Interval), by Outcome Measures at Imme- </p>

<p> diate Posttest </p>

<p> clustered by school. The confidence interval for the </p>

<p> weighted mean effect size for drug use overlaps with </p>

<p> zero, meaning than it is not significantly different from </p>

<p> zero. </p>

<p> Because averaging alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana </p>

<p> use for the drug use effect size could obscure </p>

<p> substantial differences among substances, we calculated </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s weighted mean effect sizes separately for </p>

<p> alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. None of the </p>

<p> individual effect sizes for any of the three substances </p>

<p> from any study is larger than 0.15. The mean immediate </p>

<p> effect size for alcohol use is 0.06 (95% CI: .00, .12); </p>

<p> for tobacco use, 0.08 (95% CI: .02, .14); and for </p>

<p> marijuana use, =FE0.01 (95% CI: =FE.09, .07). Only the mean </p>

<p> for tobacco use is statistically significant. =20 </p>

<p> The range of effect sizes, both individually by </p>

<p> study and averaged across studies, suggests that D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> has been more effective at immediate posttest in </p>

<p> influencing some outcomes than others. The core </p>

<p> curriculum has been most effective in increasing </p>

<p> knowledge about drug use and in enhancing social skills.=20 </p>

<p> Although some studies reported fairly large effect sizes </p>

<p> for attitudes about drugs and attitude toward police, </p>

<p> overall the studies show less D.A.R.E. success in </p>

<p> influencing these factors and self-esteem. Based on </p>

<p> these eight studies, the core curriculum has been least </p>

<p> effective at immediate posttest at influencing drug use </p>

<p> outcomes: alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. The </p>

<p> small effect sizes for drug use and attitudes about drugs </p>

<p> and police reflect, at least in part, the low levels of </p>

<p> drug use by this age group and their already negative </p>

<p> attitudes about drugs and positive attitude toward </p>

<p> police. </p>

<p> Comparison of D.A.R.E.'s Effectiveness to Other </p>

<p> Drug Use Prevention Programs for Youth </p>

<p> To see how D.A.R.E. compares with other school- </p>

<p> based drug use prevention programs, we compared the </p>

<p> weighted mean D.A.R.E. effect sizes with weighted mean </p>

<p> effect sizes computed for similar programs. For </p>

<p> comparison, we used the effect sizes reported in Tobler's </p>

<p> recent meta-analysis of school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs (Tobler, in press, 1994). To allow the most </p>

<p> appropriate comparisons with D.A.R.E. effect sizes, we </p>

<p> obtained Tobler's results for only those programs, </p>

<p> excluding D.A.R.E., aimed at fifth and sixth graders.=20 </p>

<p> Although pupils in the comparison programs were in the </p>

<p> fifth and sixth grade, some sixth graders were in middle </p>

<p> school, whereas all D.A.R.E. sixth graders were in </p>

<p> elementary school. Like the D.A.R.E. studies, the </p>

<p> interventions analyzed by Tobler were implemented in </p>

<p> geographically diverse areas. Also similar to the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies, demographic information was not </p>

<p> reported across all studies. The available data suggest </p>

<p> that the studies in Tobler's review represented both </p>

<p> white and minority populations and included urban, </p>

<p> suburban, and rural areas with urban areas predominating.=20 </p>

<p> These programs are a subset of 25 from the 114 programs </p>

<p> included in Tobler's meta-analysis. The studies from </p>

<p> Tobler's meta-analysis are referenced in Exhibit 7.5 and </p>

<p> listed in Appendix C. </p>

<p> We selected Tobler's meta-analysis for comparison </p>

<p> because it is more similar to our review than other meta- </p>

<p> analyses of drug use prevention programs (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, </p>

<p> 1986). Tobler's meta-analysis and ours used similar </p>

<p> processes and criteria to identify and select program </p>

<p> evaluations for examination and included both published </p>

<p> and unpublished studies. Like the D.A.R.E. criteria, </p>

<p> Tobler selected student-based quantitative evaluations </p>

<p> that included a control or comparison group and used a </p>

<p> pretest-posttest sign or posttest only with random </p>

<p> assignment. In addition, Tobler reported separate </p>

<p> weighted mean effect sizes for four categories of outcome </p>

<p> measures that are comparable to four of our outcome </p>

<p> measurements: knowledge, attitudes toward drugs, social </p>

<p> skills, and drug use. The meta-analyses differed, </p>

<p> however, in that Tobler excluded studies that did not </p>

<p> measure drug use and that included results from later </p>

<p> posttests. In addition, some of Tobler's programs </p>

<p> focused on a single drug rather than on multiple drugs as </p>

<p> in D.A.R.E. The collective impact of these Exhibit 7.5

<p> tions. Some publications reported on more than </p>

<p> of these references. </p>

<p> differences should be minimal, however. Overall, the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies are highly comparable in </p>

<p> terms of program focus, study methodology, and target </p>

<p> audience. In assessing the magnitude of the effect sizes </p>

<p> reported for the Tobler studies, it should be noted that </p>

<p> the studies typically did not correct for the correlation </p>

<p> among students in the same school. As explained for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies, this may produce inflated effect sizes.=20 </p>

<p> Because neither the D.A.R.E. nor Tobler studies generally </p>

<p> made adjustments for this interdependence of </p>

<p> observations, the net effect on the comparison of effect </p>

<p> sizes should be minimal. </p>

<p> The evaluation studies included in Tobler's meta- </p>

<p> analysis are classified into two broad categories based </p>

<p> on typical combinations of program content and program </p>

<p> process (process describes the teaching approach, or how </p>

<p> the content is delivered): noninteractive (N=3D9) and </p>

<p> interactive programs (N=3D16). =20 </p>

<p> Noninteractive programs emphasize intrapersonal </p>

<p> factors and use more traditional teaching approaches.=20 </p>

<p> Activities typically are designed to increase knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs, boost self-esteem, promote self-awareness, </p>

<p> increase problem-solving skills, and promote values </p>

<p> clarifications. These activities, in turn, are expected </p>

<p> to encourage youth to make a personal decision to abstain </p>

<p> from using drugs. Program content is usually introduced </p>

<p> by the teacher in a didactic manner, and participatory </p>

<p> activities often involve teacher-led discussions. </p>

<p> Interactive programs emphasize interpersonal </p>

<p> factors and use a participatory teaching approach.=20 </p>

<p> Activities are designed to counter peer pressure to use </p>

<p> drugs through developing drug refusal skills, promoting </p>

<p> general social competencies, and correcting beliefs about </p>

<p> the prevalence of drug use among peers. Program process </p>

<p> emphasizes the interaction and exchange of ideas among </p>

<p> peers, and it encourages active participation of all </p>

<p> students in the classroom, particularly in small groups. </p>

<p> Consistent with other meta-analyses showing that </p>

<p> programs emphasizing social skills tend to be the most </p>

<p> effective at achieving their outcomes (Bangert-Drowns, </p>

<p> 1988; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; Tobler, </p>

<p> 1986), Tobler's interactive programs produced larger </p>

<p> effect sizes in all four outcome measures than </p>

<p> noninteractive programs. Because D.A.R.E. has features </p>

<p> of both noninteractive and interactive programs, we </p>

<p> compared D.A.R.E. with both categories of programs.=20 </p>

<p> The weighted mean effect sizes and 95% confidence </p>

<p> intervals by outcome for the D.A.R.E. studies and the two </p>

<p> types of comparison programs are shown in Exhibit 7.6.=20 </p>

<p> To test whether the mean effect sizes differed </p>

<p> significantly between D.A.R.E. and the noninteractive </p>

<p> programs and between D.A.R.E. and the interactive </p>

<p> programs, we also calculated the 95% confidence interval </p>

<p> around the difference between the means. If the </p>

<p> confidence interval spans zero, this indicates that the </p>

<p> difference between the two effect size means is not </p>

<p> statistically significant. Conversely, if the confidence </p>

<p> interval does not include zero, then the means are </p>

<p> determined to be significantly different; that is, the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. mean is significantly greater or less than the </p>

<p> mean for the comparison programs. The difference between </p>

<p> the weighted mean effect sizes for D.A.R.E. and both </p>

<p> A comparison of D.A.R.E. effect sizes with effect </p>

<p> sizes of noninteractive and interactive drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs for fifth and sixth graders reviewed </p>

<p> by Tobler suggests that D.A.R.E. has been more effective </p>

<p> in influencing knowledge, attitudes, and skills outcomes </p>

<p> than noninteractive programs, although only the knowledge </p>

<p> difference is statistically significant. D.A.R.E. has </p>

<p> been less effective, however, than interactive programs </p>

<p> across all outcome measures, most prominently for social </p>

<p> skills and drug use. The only difference in effect size </p>

<p> means between D.A.R.E. and interactive programs that was </p>

<p> not statistically significant was for knowledge. For </p>

<p> drug use, the average effect size for interactive </p>

<p> programs was three times greater than the average </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. effect size; for social skills, four times </p>

<p> greater than D.A.R.E.; and for attitudes, three times </p>

<p> greater. These findings suggest that greater </p>

<p> effectiveness is possible with school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs for fifth- and sixth-grade pupils </p>

<p> than is achieved by the original D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum. </p>

<p> Methodological Considerations </p>

<p> Several methodological considerations relating to </p>

<p> the evaluations included in our review and to the </p>

<p> approach we used in conducting our review bear on the </p>

<p> interpretation of the results. </p>

<p> Fundamental considerations are whether the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations selected for review are methodologically </p>

<p> strong and are sufficient in number. As is appropriate </p>

<p> for meta-analysis, we used stated and objective criteria </p>

<p> to select D.A.R.E. evaluations for review. Because the </p>

<p> evaluations we selected had a comparison group, </p>

<p> administered both pretests and posttests, used </p>

<p> quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical </p>

<p> adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures, </p>

<p> we can be reasonably confident in their findings. </p>

<p> Eight evaluations were included in the review; this </p>

<p> is not a large number compared with the vast number of </p>

<p> sites where D.A.R.E. has been implemented. It far </p>

<p> exceeds, however, the number of evaluations of any other </p>

<p> widely available drug use prevention program. Most </p>

<p> prevention programs developed and evaluated by </p>

<p> researchers have been much less widely implemented, and </p>

<p> have received less scrutiny, than D.A.R.E. More </p>

<p> important, however, when considering the adequacy of the </p>

<p> number of studies, are the uniformity of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> curriculum content and method of delivery across </p>

<p> implementation sites, and the consistent results found </p>

<p> across geographically heterogeneous studies. This </p>

<p> uniformity and consistency suggest that a sufficient </p>

<p> number of evaluations were identified for assessment of </p>

<p> the original core curriculum's immediate effects. Even </p>

<p> so, we would have preferred a full set of eight effect </p>

<p> sizes for each outcome. </p>

<p> The immediate effect sizes for the D.A.R.E. studies </p>

<p> may have been attenuated compared with the comparison </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs because the control groups </p>

<p> were not pure &quot;no treatment&quot; groups. As documented
by </p>

<p> Tobler (1986, in press, 1994), effect sizes are lower </p>

<p> when the control group receives some sort of drug </p>

<p> education. Information generally was lacking from the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. evaluations on alternative interventions </p>

<p> received by the control groups, but it is likely that </p>

<p> most control groups received some drug education because </p>

<p> the studies occurred after the passage of the 1986 DFSCA.=20 </p>

<p> However, approximately half (54%) of the comparison </p>

<p> programs used for Tobler's study also were conducted </p>

<p> between 1986 and 1990, suggesting that they also may </p>

<p> suffer from the same effect. Nevertheless, the lower </p>

<p> effect sizes of the D.A.R.E. programs compared with the </p>

<p> interactive programs in Tobler's study could be due in </p>

<p> part to the likelihood that the control groups for the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies received a stronger intervention than </p>

<p> did the control groups in the studies reviewed by Tobler. </p>

<p> Most of the drug use prevention programs evaluated </p>

<p> by Tobler are smaller-scale university research-based </p>

<p> evaluation studies, while D.A.R.E. is a widely available </p>

<p> curriculum. In both cases, however, the interventions </p>

<p> were implemented by service providers and the evaluations </p>

<p> were conducted by researchers. Even so, the intensity of </p>

<p> efforts devoted to interventions conducted for evaluation </p>

<p> research may be greater, the implementation conditions </p>

<p> more optimal, and the possibility for scrutiny and </p>

<p> control greater than would be the case for a program that </p>

<p> is widely disseminated. Some diminished effectiveness </p>

<p> may be inevitable once programs are implemented under </p>

<p> real-world conditions. This could be an important factor </p>

<p> in explaining some of the differences in effect sizes </p>

<p> between D.A.R.E. and the comparison programs. </p>

<p> Differences in the studies selected for our </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. review and selected by Tobler could also </p>

<p> contribute to the relative differences in effect sizes </p>

<p> between these programs. The differences include the </p>

<p> exclusion of studies by Tobler that did not evaluate drug </p>

<p> use behavior and the inclusion of outcomes from later </p>

<p> posttests. In addition, some sixth graders in the </p>

<p> programs reviewed by Tobler were in middle rather than </p>

<p> elementary school, and some programs focused on a single </p>

<p> drug, such as tobacco, rather than multiple drugs as is </p>

<p> the case with D.A.R.E. It is possible that these </p>

<p> differences could decrease, increase, or not change the </p>

<p> relative differences in effect sizes. For example, </p>

<p> differences might have been less if programs focused on a </p>

<p> single substance were not included in Tobler's meta- </p>

<p> analysis. It is possible that single substance programs </p>

<p> have greater impact on use of that substance than generic </p>

<p> drug education programs, although study of this </p>

<p> possibility is limited and findings are mixed (Tobler, </p>

<p> 1994). On the other hand, differences might have been </p>

<p> greater had Tobler excluded results from posttests beyond </p>

<p> immediate follow-up because curriculum effects tend to </p>

<p> decay rather than increase with time (Ellickson, Bell, &amp; </p>

<p> McGuigan, 1993; Murray, Pirie, Luepker, &amp; Pallonen, </p>

<p> 1989). The limited number of programs precluded </p>

<p> assessment of these possibilities, as well as whether </p>

<p> program effects differ, and in what direction, for sixth </p>

<p> graders in elementary versus middle school. </p>

<p> Finally, it is possible that our results might have </p>

<p> differed if there had been sufficient numbers of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations and studies in Tobler's analysis to analyze </p>

<p> effect sizes while controlling the effects of other </p>

<p> factors. In addition to the differences between the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and Tobler studies described above, it is </p>

<p> possible that other factors may have varied across the </p>

<p> intervention programs and associated evaluation studies </p>

<p> that contributed to the observed differences in effect </p>

<p> sizes. For example, substantial variation in </p>

<p> characteristics of the students (e.g., in </p>

<p> race/ethnicity), features of the interventions (e.g., </p>

<p> variations in program intensity), and features of the </p>

<p> research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- </p>

<p> experimental design) could have contributed to the </p>

<p> differences in program effects. In other words, some of </p>

<p> the differences in effect sizes observed between the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies and Tobler's studies could have been due </p>

<p> to other factors than the type of program.=20 </p>

<p> Unfortunately, these possibilities could not be tested </p>

<p> because of the small number of studies. Further testing </p>

<p> is warranted when larger samples of D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison studies are available. </p>

<p> Summary </p>

<p> From a pool of 18 quantitative D.A.R.E. evaluation </p>

<p> studies identified by this review, eight met specified </p>

<p> methodological criteria and were selected for further </p>

<p> review. Each of these eight evaluations had a control </p>

<p> group, administered both pretests and posttests, used </p>

<p> quantifiable outcome measures, and made statistical </p>

<p> adjustments for pretest differences on outcome measures.=20 </p>

<p> Effect sizes for these studies at immediate posttest, </p>

<p> both individually by study and averaged across studies, </p>

<p> showed that the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum had </p>

<p> strong and statistically significant effects on knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs. The curriculum also had a positive and </p>

<p> significant impact on social skills. The core curriculum </p>

<p> had smaller, although statistically significant, effects </p>

<p> on attitudes about drug use, attitude toward the police, </p>

<p> and self-esteem. The curriculum had limited immediate </p>

<p> effects on use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana.=20 </p>

<p> Although the effect on tobacco use was small, it was </p>

<p> statistically significant. </p>

<p> Weighted mean effect sizes were used to compare </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. with other school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs targeted at same-age youth. The original </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum compared favorably with </p>

<p> noninteractive drug use prevention programs, which </p>

<p> emphasize intrapersonal factors and use more traditional </p>

<p> teaching methods. The original core curriculum compared </p>

<p> less favorably, however, with interactive drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs. Interactive drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs, which emphasize interpersonal skills and an </p>

<p> interactive teaching style, have been shown to be the </p>

<p> most successful drug use prevention programs (Tobler, in </p>

<p> press, 1994). </p>

<p> Several methodological considerations should be </p>

<p> noted in interpreting the results of this review. These </p>

<p> include the number of methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies in our review; the purity of the control groups </p>

<p> in the D.A.R.E. evaluations compared with those in the </p>

<p> comparison programs; and the relative impacts of </p>

<p> commercial programs such as D.A.R.E. and smaller scale </p>

<p> research-based interventions; and the small number of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison studies available for assessing </p>

<p> other potential explanations for differences in program </p>

<p> effectiveness. </p>

<p> The findings of the D.A.R.E. outcome assessment are </p>

<p> discussed fully in Chapter 8. </p>

<p> CHAPTER 8 </p>

<p> DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS </p>

<p> In preceding chapters, we presented data acquired </p>

<p> from our implementation and outcome assessments of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Information about D.A.R.E.'s operations, </p>

<p> prevalence, and effectiveness was collected from a </p>

<p> variety of sources. Given the complex nature of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. organization, it is not surprising that the </p>

<p> findings are voluminous. Nor is it surprising that </p>

<p> although some findings attest to the strengths and </p>

<p> robustness of D.A.R.E., others indicate limitations.=20 </p>

<p> This final chapter presents a discussion of these </p>

<p> findings. In the course of this discussion, we highlight </p>

<p> the key findings and, where appropriate, make </p>

<p> recommendations for programmatic changes and additional </p>

<p> research. =20 </p>

<p> This chapter is organized into three sections.=20 </p>

<p> Highlights from the implementation assessment are </p>

<p> presented in the first section, followed by key findings </p>

<p> from the outcome assessment. To facilitate a review of </p>

<p> the study's many and sometimes disparate findings, our </p>

<p> discussion is organized by some of the questions that </p>

<p> guided these study components. In the final section, we </p>

<p> attempt to synthesize the most important findings and </p>

<p> present overall conclusions derived from the study. </p>

<p> Implementation Assessment </p>

<p> As discussed in Chapter 1, we conducted an </p>

<p> implementation assessment of D.A.R.E. that had two </p>

<p> primary objectives. These were, first, to conduct an </p>

<p> assessment of the organizational structure and operation </p>

<p> of representative D.A.R.E. programs nationwide to learn </p>

<p> what factors contribute to the effective implementation </p>

<p> of D.A.R.E. programs nationwide and, second, to determine </p>

<p> how D.A.R.E. is tailored to meet the needs of specific </p>

<p> populations. </p>

<p> To address these issues, we collected data from </p>

<p> sources at all levels of the multi-layered D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> institution. We presented information concerning </p>

<p> operations at the national and regional level of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> in Chapter 3, State-level operations in Chapter 4, and </p>

<p> local-level operations in Chapters 5 and 6. We obtained </p>

<p> information from interviews with Glenn Levant of D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America and with coordinators and/or educational advisors </p>

<p> from each of the five Regional Training Centers (RTCs), a </p>

<p> review of available BJA documents, a survey of the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators, a survey of a nationally </p>

<p> representative sample of school district drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators, and site visits to four purposively </p>

<p> selected schools (two with D.A.R.E. and two without). </p>

<p> How extensively is D.A.R.E. implemented nationwide, and </p>

<p> how does D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> prevalence compare with that of other curricula? </p>

<p> One of the most important findings of this study </p>

<p> was the extraordinary prevalence of D.A.R.E. In the </p>

<p> 1991-1992 school year, 44 of the 50 States had State </p>

<p> coordinators fortheir D.A.R.E. programs. Based on our sample
of school </p>

<p> districts, we estimate that over half the districts in </p>

<p> the country implemented at least one of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curricula in one or more of their schools. In </p>

<p> comparison, the two other most prevalent prevention </p>

<p> programs, Quest and Here's Looking at You (HLY), were </p>

<p> used in at least one school in about 27% and 24% of the </p>

<p> districts, respectively. </p>

<p> Another important finding is that the demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. over the next 5 years is going to increase </p>

<p> substantially. Over 40% of the districts with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> planned to expand its use. Of those districts without </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., 21% expressed the intention to institute it, </p>

<p> and 20% reported that they were as yet undecided about </p>

<p> using D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> Slightly over half of all school districts </p>

<p> implemented D.A.R.E.'s core curriculum, which is targeted </p>

<p> at 5th- and 6th-grade pupils; around 17% implemented the </p>

<p> K-4 curriculum, 11% the junior high school curriculum, </p>

<p> and 3% the senior high curriculum. Around 12% of the </p>

<p> school districts used Quest at the elementary level, 22% </p>

<p> at the middle/junior high school level, and 3% at the </p>

<p> senior high school level. Around 22% of the school </p>

<p> districts used HLY at the elementary level, 14% at the </p>

<p> middle/junior high school level, and 9% at the senior </p>

<p> high level. =20 </p>

<p> Does the extent of D.A.R.E. implementation vary by </p>

<p> demographic </p>

<p> characteristics of school districts, such as geographic </p>

<p> region, urbanicity, SES, </p>

<p> and minority status? How does D.A.R.E. compare with </p>

<p> other curricula in this </p>

<p> regard? </p>

<p> The Midwest region had the highest percentage of </p>

<p> districts using D.A.R.E. (59.9%) , followed by the </p>

<p> Southeast (56.8%), East (55.8%), West (48.8%), and </p>

<p> Southwest (37.1%). Use of Quest was highest in the </p>

<p> Midwest region (35.8%) and use of HLY was highest in the </p>

<p> East (46.4%). Use of all three prevention programs was </p>

<p> lowest in the Southwest region. The lower rates of </p>

<p> program use in the Southwest can probably be largely </p>

<p> attributed to its rural nature, and thus the greater </p>

<p> difficulties in fielding D.A.R.E. officers to </p>

<p> geographically dispersed schools. </p>

<p> There were no statistically significant differences </p>

<p> in the use of D.A.R.E., Quest, or HLY by either the </p>

<p> minority status or SES of the school districts.=20 </p>

<p> Urban/suburban school districts were, however, </p>

<p> significantly more likely to use D.A.R.E. and HLY than </p>

<p> rural districts. Further, large districts were </p>

<p> significantly more likely than small districts to use </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. We suspect that these findings may be </p>

<p> attributed to the relatively greater resources available </p>

<p> to urban and large law enforcement agencies. In the case </p>

<p> of D.A.R.E., these agencies may be at greater liberty to </p>

<p> free up their officers' time to teach D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> It is difficult to determine what adjustments might </p>

<p> make D.A.R.E. more accessible to rural and small school </p>

<p> districts. We believe that ways of improving access to </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. in rural and small districts should be examined.=20 </p>

<p> For example, methods for distributing DFSCA funds to </p>

<p> favor rural and small school districts instead of </p>

<p> distribution solely on a per capita basis could be </p>

<p> explored. =20 </p>

<p> How well integrated is D.A.R.E. with other drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs </p>

<p> offered in schools? </p>

<p> Neither D.A.R.E. nor any other drug prevention </p>

<p> program can or should stand alone in a school district; </p>

<p> instead, such programs should be integrated into a </p>

<p> comprehensive curriculum that is developmentally </p>

<p> appropriate and implemented at every grade level.=20 </p>

<p> Indeed, all school districts receiving DFSCA funds must </p>

<p> implement a comprehensive K-12 drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> Even were a school district to implement all four of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s student curricula, additional drug prevention </p>

<p> programming would still be required in the grades to </p>

<p> which D.A.R.E. was not directed. Our survey showed that </p>

<p> only 2% of the school districts used only D.A.R.E. and no </p>

<p> other drug prevention program. Almost two-thirds of the </p>

<p> school district coordinators with D.A.R.E. reported that </p>

<p> the program was &quot;very well&quot; integrated with other </p>

<p> prevention programs. </p>

<p> How does D.A.R.E. compare with other alcohol and other </p>

<p> drug (AOD) programs </p>

<p> in terms of support and satisfaction for the programs? </p>

<p> The school district drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> indicated that support for D.A.R.E. is very strong not </p>

<p> only among students and school staff=FEwhose support the </p>

<p> coordinators rated as very high=FEbut also among parents </p>

<p> and the community. These ratings were also markedly </p>

<p> higher than those for other AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> The responses of the coordinators also indicated </p>

<p> the high regard in which the D.A.R.E. curricula are held.=20 </p>

<p> Two-thirds of the school district coordinators with </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. rated the curricula, as well as how it is </p>

<p> taught, as &quot;very satisfactory&quot;; over three-quarters
gave </p>

<p> the same rating to how students receive it. This </p>

<p> endorsement is all the more vivid when contrasted with </p>

<p> coordinators' ratings of other AOD prevention programs; </p>

<p> only one-third of coordinators with other AOD programs </p>

<p> rated these programs as highly. =20 </p>

<p> A close examination of these findings reveals that </p>

<p> coordinators in districts with a high percentage of </p>

<p> minority students were more likely to rate students' </p>

<p> receptivity to D.A.R.E. as very high than those in </p>

<p> districts serving predominantly white students. This </p>

<p> finding is not confounded by the district's urbanicity or </p>

<p> SES because comparisons between coordinators from these </p>

<p> pairs of districts (i.e., by high and low SES and by </p>

<p> rural and urban/surburban) were not statistically </p>

<p> significant. =20 </p>

<p> Of even greater importance are the satisfaction </p>

<p> ratings that the prevention coordinators gave to </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s effects on students. Almost two-thirds of the </p>

<p> coordinators with D.A.R.E. indicated that they were very </p>

<p> satisfied with D.A.R.E.'s effects; less than one-quarter </p>

<p> of those with other AOD programs reported that they were </p>

<p> very satisfied with the effects of these AOD programs.=20 </p>

<p> Are D.A.R.E. and other drug prevention programs adapted </p>

<p> to a community's </p>

<p> particular needs? </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. is distinguished by the integrity and </p>

<p> consistency with which its curricula are administered.=20 </p>

<p> During their training, D.A.R.E. officers are instructed </p>

<p> not to deviate in any substantive fashion from the </p>

<p> curriculum. The D.A.R.E. core curriculum allows only one </p>

<p> modification--a gang activity lesson that can be added in </p>

<p> schools where gangs are perceived to be a problem. </p>

<p> Over two-fifths of the coordinators with D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and over half of the coordinators with other AOD programs </p>

<p> reported that the curriculum had been adapted at least to </p>

<p> some degree, however modest. The most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned reason for adaptation of both D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> other AOD programs was drug availability at their </p>

<p> schools. Coordinators with D.A.R.E. provided some hints </p>

<p> as to the types of topics introduced, which included </p>

<p> discussing specific locally prevalent drugs, drug abuse </p>

<p> at home, and local drug arrests. During the site visit </p>

<p> to the urban school district, we learned that some police </p>

<p> officers incorporate their own street experiences into </p>

<p> their lessons. The second and third most frequently </p>

<p> mentioned reasons for adaptation for D.A.R.E. and other </p>

<p> AOD programs were student/community poverty and </p>

<p> racial/ethnic composition. </p>

<p> Although we recognize that some tailoring of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. to the needs of a particular audience may be </p>

<p> appropriate, we encourage fidelity to the curricula and </p>

<p> careful monitoring of officer presentation. We strongly </p>

<p> suggest that current procedures of notifying the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board curriculum committee of </p>

<p> limitations in the curricula and of substantive </p>

<p> modifications of the curricula originating from that </p>

<p> agency be continued. Allowing officers to modify the </p>

<p> program at will would quickly result in disintegration of </p>

<p> the curriculum and the program. </p>

<p> To what extent are classroom teachers and other community </p>

<p> members or </p>

<p> agencies involved in D.A.R.E.? </p>

<p> The original core curriculum, which was in use when </p>

<p> the survey was conducted, encouraged classroom teachers </p>

<p> to remain in the classroom and to communicate D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> objectives to students. However, teachers played little </p>

<p> active part in the actual instruction. Teachers and </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers together teach the junior and senior </p>

<p> high curricula; at the senior high level, they are even </p>

<p> trained together. According to the drug prevention </p>

<p> coordinators, teachers in almost 90% of the districts </p>

<p> remained in the classroom during D.A.R.E. lessons, and in </p>

<p> 84% teachers were reported as &quot;actively involved&quot;
in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. The revised core curriculum encourages </p>

<p> classroom teachers to take a more active role. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers already are expected to meet for </p>

<p> an hour or so with the classroom teachers in a brief, </p>

<p> structured orientation and discussion. To the extent </p>

<p> that time and resources permit, we encourage the </p>

<p> co-training of teachers and officers at every curricular </p>

<p> level because we believe that such training would enhance </p>

<p> effective communication and coordination between the two.=20 </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> One of D.A.R.E.'s strengths is the active </p>

<p> involvement of individuals in D.A.R.E., both within and </p>

<p> outside of the school. Half of the prevention </p>

<p> coordinators reported that school staff, other than </p>

<p> classroom teachers, were actively involved in D.A.R.E., </p>

<p> and almost one-quarter reported that civic groups were </p>

<p> actively involved. This level of involvement surely </p>

<p> makes a major contribution to the high level of </p>

<p> enthusiasm that D.A.R.E. generates. We note that only a </p>

<p> relatively few coordinators reported that &quot;youth
groups&quot; </p>

<p> were involved in D.A.R.E. We recommend increasing the </p>

<p> involvement of both youth and church groups as a way to </p>

<p> reinforce D.A.R.E.'s message and to help establish </p>

<p> anti-drug use norms throughout the school and community.=20 </p>

<p> About half of the coordinators reported that </p>

<p> parents were actively involved in D.A.R.E. Our site </p>

<p> visits, however, suggested that parents tend to be rather </p>

<p> detached. D.A.R.E.'s efforts to reach out to parents </p>

<p> through the parent curriculum are commendable and, we </p>

<p> hope, will prove successful. Many such efforts in the </p>

<p> past have proved futile because the parents who are most </p>

<p> in need of educational intervention are also the most </p>

<p> difficult to reach and most resistant to attending </p>

<p> meetings. One additional method to involve parents more </p>

<p> directly in D.A.R.E. is to assign specific parent-child </p>

<p> homework exercises that, at the very least, will open </p>

<p> vital lines of communication between parent and child </p>

<p> concerning drug use. A second method that could </p>

<p> supplement the D.A.R.E. parent curriculum would be to </p>

<p> develop a freestanding, 1-hour video. This video could </p>

<p> be used to provide an introduction to D.A.R.E. and a </p>

<p> synopsis of the D.A.R.E. curriculum, as to well as </p>

<p> provide information about how to effectively reinforce </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s message. It might, for instance, include </p>

<p> advice about how to talk to youth about drugs and stress </p>

<p> the importance of serving as a model for a drug-free </p>

<p> life. We, thus, recommend that D.A.R.E. consider and </p>

<p> weigh the relative merits of a variety of strategies </p>

<p> designed to reach parents who may not respond to the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. parent curriculum. </p>

<p> What role, if any, do D.A.R.E. officers have in treatment </p>

<p> referral for students </p>

<p> who already have substance abuse problems? </p>

<p> An additional role that D.A.R.E. officers can </p>

<p> undertake is to serve as members of student assistance </p>

<p> program (SAP) teams. Of the school districts that had </p>

<p> both SAPs and D.A.R.E., 37% had D.A.R.E. officers who had </p>

<p> been trained to participate in the district's SAP. Most </p>

<p> of the coordinators rated D.A.R.E. officers as highly as </p>

<p> they did guidance counselors (and much higher than </p>

<p> teachers) in effectiveness in implementing SAPs. We </p>

<p> recommend that D.A.R.E. officers become familiar with </p>

<p> SAPs in their schools and, when feasible, become involved </p>

<p> in these programs. We also recommend that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board establish procedures for </p>

<p> officers to follow when their work with SAPs comes in </p>

<p> conflict with their duties as a police officer, so that </p>

<p> the confidentiality of youth and their parents who have </p>

<p> drug problems may be maintained. </p>

<p> How is D.A.R.E. managed at the national, regional, and </p>

<p> State level, and what </p>

<p> are the major responsibilities of the governing bodies? </p>

<p> At the national level, all D.A.R.E. operations are </p>

<p> overseen by D.A.R.E. America, a nonprofit organization </p>

<p> that bears ultimate responsibility for promoting, </p>

<p> monitoring, and overseeing the program. In this </p>

<p> capacity, D.A.R.E. America is assisted by a number of </p>

<p> regional and State organizations. These include five </p>

<p> RTCs that constitute the D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory </p>

<p> Board and make recommendations to D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> concerning the accreditation of State-level training </p>

<p> centers and monitor the fidelity with which the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum is taught at the local level. Educational </p>

<p> specialists representing the RTCs, together with staff </p>

<p> from the Los Angeles United School District (LAUSD) and </p>

<p> assisted by a Scientific Advisory Committee, also make </p>

<p> recommendations to D.A.R.E. America concerning </p>

<p> modifications to the various D.A.R.E. curricula. </p>

<p> State-level D.A.R.E. entities include chartered </p>

<p> nonprofit D.A.R.E. organizations designed to support the </p>

<p> program in that State; such organizations currently exist </p>

<p> in over one-third of the States, and it is expected that </p>

<p> they will be chartered in all 50. In those States that </p>

<p> currently lack such an organization, there is typically a </p>

<p> State employee designated as a D.A.R.E. coordinator. In </p>

<p> addition, 42 States currently have developed State </p>

<p> Training Centers (STCs), the purpose of which is to </p>

<p> conduct training for prospective D.A.R.E. officers. </p>

<p> Updating and improving curricular materials and </p>

<p> teaching strategies is a difficult task. We commend </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America for convening a Scientific Advisory </p>

<p> Committee, and for choosing Dr. Kleber as committee </p>

<p> chair. It is our understanding that the committee's </p>

<p> charge is an expansive one and includes reviewing current </p>

<p> and ongoing D.A.R.E. evaluations, and integrating </p>

<p> relevant findings from other evaluations of school-based </p>

<p> drug prevention programs. We recognize the constraints </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. faces in updating the curricula, given the </p>

<p> considerable costs required to retrain D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> appropriately. Hence, it is probably not feasible to </p>

<p> make substantive changes to the curricula more frequently </p>

<p> than once every 5 years, at a minimum. </p>

<p> Another source of expertise that should be tapped </p>

<p> as input for curricular changes is the U.S. Department of </p>

<p> Education. Various D.A.R.E. materials encourage the </p>

<p> establishment of strong ties between D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> education at both the State and local levels. At the </p>

<p> national level, an educational consultant from each of </p>

<p> the five RTCs make suggestions concerning the curricula.=20 </p>

<p> However, it is our understanding that this group lacks </p>

<p> representation from a national-level education agency.=20 </p>

<p> We thus recommend thatthe D.A.R.E. America request an
appropriate member of= </p>

<p> the </p>

<p> U.S. Department of Education to serve as an ex officio </p>

<p> member, who should represent the department's extensive </p>

<p> drug prevention program. Such an individual would be </p>

<p> able to provide D.A.R.E. America with guidance as to how </p>

<p> effectively to integrate D.A.R.E. into the Department of </p>

<p> Education's comprehensive, K-12 drug prevention strategy.=20 </p>

<p> Furthermore, the inclusion of a U.S. Department of </p>

<p> Education staff member seems particularly appropriate as </p>

<p> long as D.A.R.E. continues to be mentioned as a specific </p>

<p> line item on the DFSCA budget. =20 </p>

<p> State coordinators informed us that over one-third </p>

<p> of the States had policy advisory boards (PABs), a </p>

<p> proportion that may have increased in the 2 years since </p>

<p> our survey. Because PABs can be instrumental in </p>

<p> developing and maintaining communications and positive </p>

<p> relationships among the various agencies involved in </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., we recommend that all States establish such </p>

<p> boards. </p>

<p> The great majority of the PABs comprise </p>

<p> representatives of both State and local law enforcement </p>

<p> and education. Other key individuals from the community </p>

<p> who have a stake in the success of D.A.R.E. or who could </p>

<p> provide different and valuable perspectives on D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> were less well represented. These include parents, </p>

<p> members of community-based organizations, citizens-at- </p>

<p> large, members of associations of educators, and business </p>

<p> representatives. The latter could be particularly </p>

<p> helpful in securing resources for D.A.R.E. We thus </p>

<p> recommend that State-level PABs systematically examine </p>

<p> their representation and seek ways to reach out to new </p>

<p> and potentially useful constituencies by expanding their </p>

<p> membership. </p>

<p> Because of the unique partnership between D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and education, it is critical that State-level D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> operations have strong ties to education at the State </p>

<p> level. Around one-third of the State D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> coordinators reported a great deal of communication with </p>

<p> the State Department of Education, and another 50% </p>

<p> reported having at least some communication. We also </p>

<p> note that one State D.A.R.E. coordinator was affiliated </p>

<p> with a State Department of Education, and that three PABs </p>

<p> were chaired by staff members from State or local </p>

<p> education departments. The need to improve communication </p>

<p> with their State's education departments was mentioned by </p>

<p> several State D.A.R.E. coordinators. </p>

<p> One way to improve communication between D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> and education is for State D.A.R.E. programs to retain </p>

<p> educational consultants to act as liaisons. Two-thirds </p>

<p> of the State coordinators reported employing such a </p>

<p> consultant, and almost all of the States without </p>

<p> educational consultants considered acquiring a full-time </p>

<p> educational consultant to be priority. We recommend that </p>

<p> all State D.A.R.E. programs secure educational </p>

<p> consultants. </p>

<p> In a few States, the State D.A.R.E. programs </p>

<p> employed their own educational consultants. In most </p>

<p> States, however, educational consultants were employed by </p>

<p> education departments. We believe the liaison between </p>

<p> law enforcement and education will be most effective if </p>

<p> the consultants are based in the State Departments of </p>

<p> Education. Ideally, to ensure a maximum level of </p>

<p> coordination both with the State Departments of Education </p>

<p> as a whole and with their drug-free schools program in </p>

<p> particular, these consultants should be members of the </p>

<p> departments' alcohol and drug prevention offices.=20 </p>

<p> Certainly, regardless of whether the education </p>

<p> consultants are employed by education or directly by the </p>

<p> State D.A.R.E. program, they should seek all appropriate </p>

<p> means to establish meaningful affiliations with State- </p>

<p> level educational agencies. By the same token, education </p>

<p> agencies should be apprised of=FEand take seriously=FEtheir </p>

<p> responsibility to include D.A.R.E. representatives in </p>

<p> planning statewide drug prevention activities. To be </p>

<p> truly effective, education and law enforcement need to </p>

<p> work together in a partnership at the national and State </p>

<p> levels as well as at the local level. </p>

<p> Educational consultants' roles may vary, but </p>

<p> besides providing a &quot;bridge&quot; between the two </p>

<p> organizations, the consultants should help ensure that </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s multiple curricula fit into a comprehensive, </p>

<p> developmentally appropriate drug prevention program.=20 </p>

<p> Several coordinators mentioned that consultants could </p>

<p> assist with program evaluation and with monitoring </p>

<p> officer performance in the classroom. It may be </p>

<p> appropriate to consider expanding the roles of </p>

<p> educational consultants further, perhaps to provide </p>

<p> assistance in these areas. =20 </p>

<p> How is D.A.R.E. managed at the local level? </p>

<p> At the local level, the majority of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> programs were managed by a single law enforcement agency, </p>

<p> primarily the sheriff's or city/town police department.=20 </p>

<p> Officer selection and classroom activities was most </p>

<p> frequently mentioned as the responsibility of the police </p>

<p> department, selection of D.A.R.E. classrooms was the </p>

<p> responsibility of the school administration and staff, </p>

<p> and responsibility for selection of D.A.R.E. schools was </p>

<p> shared by the police department, school administration </p>

<p> and staff, and the school superintendent.=20 </p>

<p> In a number of places throughout this report, we </p>

<p> have mentioned that D.A.R.E. is a collaborative venture </p>

<p> between a local school district and a law enforcement </p>

<p> agency, and we have emphasized the importance of </p>

<p> developing a positive relationship between the two from </p>

<p> the outset. One way to foster this relationship at the </p>

<p> local level is with written agreements that clearly state </p>

<p> the roles and responsibilities of each. Less than half </p>

<p> of the drug prevention coordinators mentioned that their </p>

<p> districts had such an agreement. We recognize that some </p>

<p> of the coordinators responding to our survey may simply </p>

<p> not have known that a written agreement existed, </p>

<p> particularly if they were new in their position and the </p>

<p> agreement had been written before they were employed. We </p>

<p> recommend that the law enforcement agencies without such </p>

<p> agreements secure them. Furthermore, we recommend that </p>

<p> the agreements be reviewed with school administration/ </p>

<p> staff at least every other year. This biennial review </p>

<p> would ensure that all parties are aware of their </p>

<p> responsibilities and could also serve as forums to </p>

<p> discuss issues relating to D.A.R.E.'s implementation and </p>

<p> to develop additional ways in which the D.A.R.E. officer </p>

<p> can serve the schools. They could also provide </p>

<p> opportunities for the school district to recognize the </p>

<p> officer's contribution. </p>

<p> Another way to engender a positive collaboration </p>

<p> between law enforcement and education is by developing </p>

<p> close liaisons between the D.A.R.E. officer and classroom </p>

<p> teacher. Such liaisons have obvious benefits, including </p>

<p> providing a role model for new officers, sharing the </p>

<p> burden of difficult classes or difficult students, and </p>

<p> increasing the likelihood that the teacher will reinforce </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. message in other areas of instruction. We </p>

<p> learned from the drug prevention coordinators' survey </p>

<p> that classroom teachers in almost three-quarters of the </p>

<p> school districts with D.A.R.E. now integrate the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> message into their other activities in the classroom, so </p>

<p> that the program has a strong foundation in this area on </p>

<p> which to build. We thus recommend that D.A.R.E. officers </p>

<p> spend more time consulting with classroom teachers, both </p>

<p> formally at the beginning of the semester and informally </p>

<p> as the semester progresses. Topics for conversation </p>

<p> should include both the content of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum and how teachers can effectively articulate an </p>

<p> anti-drug message. </p>

<p> What funding mechanisms are at the national/regional, </p>

<p> State, and local levels? </p>

<p> At the national/regional level, funding is received </p>

<p> primarily from BJA. The RTC coordinators mentioned the </p>

<p> need to find permanent funding sources that will </p>

<p> supplement Federal support and make D.A.R.E. less </p>

<p> vulnerable to the vicissitudes of such funding. One </p>

<p> solution to this issue is to establish or strengthen </p>

<p> reliance on State or local support, particularly the </p>

<p> latter. =20 </p>

<p> The majority of State D.A.R.E. programs receive </p>

<p> funding from BJA grants; around one-fourth of the States </p>

<p> received funding from governors' grants, grants from </p>

<p> other State agencies, and legislative funds. Four States </p>

<p> reported that they received no funding for their State- </p>

<p> level operations, and around one-third mentioned that </p>

<p> maintaining and increasing their funding or locating new </p>

<p> funding sources were among the most significant issues </p>

<p> facing them. If they are to discharge multiple </p>

<p> responsibilities for developing and managing their </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs successfully, the States must have </p>

<p> sufficient support. We recommend that the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board explore further the various </p>

<p> sources of support used by the State programs, and how </p>

<p> these have been obtained, and then provide technical </p>

<p> assistance to those States that currently operate with </p>

<p> either no funding or whose funding is precariously low.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America could perhaps play a role in assisting </p>

<p> the development and maintenance of the STCs by providing </p>

<p> modest grant programs to assist States. =20 </p>

<p> At the local level, the cost of assigning a police </p>

<p> officer to deliver D.A.R.E. is assumed by the local city </p>

<p> or county law enforcement agency, and thus, ultimately, </p>

<p> by the community. Only a small minority of prevention </p>

<p> coordinators (one in six) indicated that program costs </p>

<p> were a barrier to implementation. D.A.R.E. America </p>

<p> assumes the costs of program curriculum materials. The </p>

<p> coordinators also informed us that primary support for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. came from law enforcement, but that DFSCA funds </p>

<p> also played a major role in supporting D.A.R.E., as did </p>

<p> (to a lesser extent) school district funds. We note that </p>

<p> non-D.A.R.E. drug prevention programs appear much more </p>

<p> dependent on DFSCA funds than does D.A.R.E. Given </p>

<p> projected cuts in the DFSCA budget, which we understand </p>

<p> may amount to as much as 25% in the near future, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s relative lack of reliance on DFSCA funds will </p>

<p> prove beneficial. We also note that D.A.R.E. is </p>

<p> relatively less dependent on local funds than are non- </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. programs, which also decreases D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> vulnerability to cuts as competing demands increase ever </p>

<p> tighter budgets. </p>

<p> How adequately does D.A.R.E. training meet the needs of </p>

<p> an expanding and changing program? </p>

<p> As noted earlier, the core curriculum has recently </p>

<p> been revised, and the new version is currently being </p>

<p> implemented. Because of D.A.R.E.'s magnitude, curricular </p>

<p> changes are far-reaching and, thus, expensive and time- </p>

<p> consuming to implement. Therefore, modifications to any </p>

<p> of the D.A.R.E. curricula must necessarily be weighed </p>

<p> against the substantial costs associated with updating </p>

<p> and distributing material, as well as retraining D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers. Nevertheless, modifications to the curricula </p>

<p> will need to be made periodically if D.A.R.E. is to </p>

<p> remain on the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of drug prevention </p>

<p> programming.=20 </p>

<p> To reduce the burden on D.A.R.E. of keeping </p>

<p> officers up-to-date with modifications to the curriculum, </p>

<p> the RTCs should explore novel means to provide officers </p>

<p> with curriculum and teaching updates and to provide </p>

<p> formal in-service training on a periodic basis. One in- </p>

<p> service training method that should be considered is the </p>

<p> use of the Law Enforcement Television Network (LETN).=20 </p>

<p> Because a substantial and growing number of police and </p>

<p> sheriffs' departments are linked to this network, it </p>

<p> could be an effective and cost-efficient means of </p>

<p> providing high-quality in-service programming to D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers around the country. Ideally, such a system </p>

<p> should be interactive to allow for discussions between </p>

<p> officers and trainers. Another less costly and more </p>

<p> accessible method that could be explored is the use of </p>

<p> videotaped programs to explain and demonstrate changes to </p>

<p> curricula and teaching methods. Still another </p>

<p> alternative is to use an on-line computer billboard to </p>

<p> distribute the latest D.A.R.E. information. This method </p>

<p> could be made available at very low cost to all police </p>

<p> departments with computers and modems. We learned from </p>

<p> the January 1992 D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board </p>

<p> minutes that such a system was being developed by </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America and indeed may now be in place. </p>

<p> In-service training should clearly not be </p>

<p> restricted to teaching D.A.R.E. officers how to implement </p>

<p> modifications to existing curricula. Such training could </p>

<p> also serve to increase the competence of newly minted </p>

<p> officers over their first semester. Regardless of how </p>

<p> powerful and effective the initial 80-hour introduction </p>

<p> to D.A.R.E. is, D.A.R.E. officers are bound to forget </p>

<p> some of what they have been taught when, 3 months later, </p>

<p> they are teaching one of the final D.A.R.E. lessons for </p>

<p> the first time. One potentially useful device would be </p>

<p> to develop and distribute taped versions of an expert </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officer delivering the curriculum to real </p>

<p> classrooms, which new officers could be encouraged to </p>

<p> review immediately prior to the first time they teach the </p>

<p> lesson. Such tapes could serve several purposes: to </p>

<p> reinforce the content of what should be taught, to model </p>

<p> how the lesson should be taught, and to teach classroom </p>

<p> management techniques. Each videotape might highlight </p>

<p> dealing with a special problem (e.g., how to generate a </p>

<p> discussion when students tend to be silent; how to draw </p>

<p> out a shy or largely silent child; and how to respond </p>

<p> when a child discloses drug use by a peer, friend, or </p>

<p> family member). Each of these tapes should be relatively </p>

<p> short (or they will not be viewed) but could be followed </p>

<p> by a summary of the key points the officer should keep in </p>

<p> mind in teaching the next lesson. The tapes would also </p>

<p> help ensure that a primary goal of D.A.R.E. be reached-- </p>

<p> that lessons be taught uniformly. </p>

<p> Another training issue confronting the RTCs is the </p>

<p> development and maintenance of STCs. As D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> continues to grow=FEand our study has demonstrated that </p>

<p> demand for D.A.R.E. shows no signs of abatement=FEthe RTCs </p>

<p> will become increasingly challenged to meet the training </p>

<p> and monitoring needs of their constituent States. The </p>

<p> development and maintenance of STCs is critical because </p>

<p> the RTCs cannot assume the multiple burdens of training, </p>

<p> mentoring, and monitoring D.A.R.E. officers, as well as </p>

<p> assisting local law enforcement in developing and </p>

<p> maintaining effective ties with school districts. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators indicated that training and monitoring </p>

<p> officers already strain the capacities of the RTCs. We </p>

<p> recommend that sufficient funding be appropriated to </p>

<p> establish and/or maintain an STC in every State. =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers are not the only D.A.R.E. staff </p>

<p> in need of ongoing training and technical assistance; </p>

<p> several RTC coordinators indicated that many of the State </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. coordinators have a similar need. RTC </p>

<p> coordinators also indicated that State coordinators need </p>

<p> support in developing lines of communication and </p>

<p> authority with local-level law enforcement agencies and </p>

<p> school districts, many of which have been operating with </p>

<p> a fair degree of autonomy or have been used to dealing </p>

<p> directly with the RTCs. It might be helpful if the RTCs </p>

<p> brought together their constituent State coordinators at </p>

<p> least yearly to discover and discuss common needs and </p>

<p> concerns and provide technical assistance to the </p>

<p> coordinators as a group as appropriate. However, the </p>

<p> need will still exist for resources to support individual </p>

<p> consultation between the RTCs and their respective State </p>

<p> coordinators. </p>

<p> As we mentioned earlier, the demand for D.A.R.E. in </p>

<p> school districts that currently lack the program is </p>

<p> likely to be exacerbated by the lack of available </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. officers. Fully 60% of the school districts </p>

<p> indicated that they want either to begin or increase </p>

<p> their use of D.A.R.E. Some of the RTC staff indicated </p>

<p> training may not be able to keep up with the demand for </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Almost 15% of the drug prevention coordinators </p>

<p> identified lack of sufficient officers as a barrier to </p>

<p> implementing D.A.R.E. This problem was illustrated in </p>

<p> the urban D.A.R.E. school district we visited, where lack </p>

<p> of available officers led to dissatisfaction on the part </p>

<p> of school officials as officers were moved from one </p>

<p> school to another to accommodate demand. Clearly, those </p>

<p> communities in which D.A.R.E. is a high priority but </p>

<p> which lack sufficient D.A.R.E. instructors should provide </p>

<p> greater support to their law enforcement agencies to </p>

<p> recruit and train additional officers. Further, the </p>

<p> surprisingly high prevalence of the relatively new junior </p>

<p> and high school D.A.R.E. curricula suggests that each </p>

<p> community should examine the extent of the perceived need </p>

<p> for each D.A.R.E. curriculum and develop a long-range </p>

<p> plan to identify and fund additional officers as </p>

<p> necessary. </p>

<p> Any substantive curricular changes affecting what, </p>

<p> and especially how, D.A.R.E. officers teach, should be </p>

<p> accompanied by a determined effort to ensure that these </p>

<p> changes are fully reflected in officer behavior in the </p>

<p> classroom. The RTC coordinators clearly stressed the </p>

<p> need for increasing officer monitoring in the field as </p>

<p> well. Monitoring officers, however, is only part of the </p>

<p> task. Adequate resources should also be made available </p>

<p> to allow mentors to work closely with officers whose </p>

<p> performance needs improvement. </p>

<p> Outcome Assessment </p>

<p> The D.A.R.E. outcome assessment, described in </p>

<p> Chapter 7, had four primary objectives. These were </p>

<p> (a) to identify prior studies of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness </p>

<p> as a drug use prevention program, (b) to assess the </p>

<p> quality and adequacy of the methodologies of these </p>

<p> studies, (c) to summarize D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness based </p>

<p> on this research, and (d) to compare D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness with that of other school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs. </p>

<p> We focused our assessment on the original D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> core curriculum, which is the heart of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> program. We did not include the junior high school, </p>

<p> senior high school, and other D.A.R.E. curricula in the </p>

<p> outcome assessment because they are more recent, not as </p>

<p> prevalent, and generally have yet to be evaluated.=20 </p>

<p> Future evaluation efforts should focus on these </p>

<p> curricula, as well as on the revised core curriculum </p>

<p> implemented in September 1994. </p>

<p> Questions that guided the outcome assessment are </p>

<p> discussed in this section. </p>

<p> What were the scope, reliability, and technical quality </p>

<p> of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> assessments? </p>

<p> A number of States and smaller localities have been </p>

<p> actively involved in assessing the D.A.R.E. core </p>

<p> curriculum since 1983, when the program was initiated in </p>

<p> Los Angeles. By using multiple sources to identify </p>

<p> studies, we obtained reports of 18 outcome studies in </p>

<p> twelve States and one Canadian province. These studies </p>

<p> collected data from students concerning D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness in influencing outcomes the curriculum </p>

<p> seeks to change. </p>

<p> We defined a set of methodological criteria to use </p>

<p> in assessing the quality and adequacy of the study </p>

<p> methodologies. The criteria, based on review of the </p>

<p> evaluation methodology literature, were (a) that the </p>

<p> study compared students who received D.A.R.E. to students </p>

<p> in a control or comparison group who did not receive </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.; (b) that outcomes of interest, such as drug </p>

<p> use, were measured both before D.A.R.E. was implemented </p>

<p> and after the program ended; (c) that measures of the </p>

<p> outcomes were constructed so as to ensure reasonable </p>

<p> certainty that they were measured accurately; and </p>

<p> (d) that in the absence of random assignment, the </p>

<p> analysis strategy adjusted for any initial differences on </p>

<p> outcome variables between D.A.R.E. and comparison </p>

<p> students. </p>

<p> Half of the 18 studies met these methodological </p>

<p> criteria; however, one study was not considered further </p>

<p> because the children were tested 1 year later rather than </p>

<p> immediately after the program. That 50% of the studies </p>

<p> were of this technical quality suggests that a high level </p>

<p> of effort has been invested in carefully evaluating </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. Because these studies avoid many of the </p>

<p> problems that commonly undermine evaluation studies, </p>

<p> reasonable confidence can be placed in their findings.=20 </p>

<p> Some of the studies exceeded our criteria, for example, </p>

<p> by randomly assigning D.A.R.E. to schools, by analyzing </p>

<p> attrition effects, by statistically adjusting differences </p>

<p> in students' background characteristics, or by using an </p>

<p> analysis strategy appropriate to the research design. We </p>

<p> recommend that these features be incorporated into future </p>

<p> studies. </p>

<p> In assessing the findings of the eight </p>

<p> methodologically rigorous D.A.R.E. studies, it should be </p>

<p> noted that the studies are not a national sample of </p>

<p> representatively selected sites. It is reassuring, </p>

<p> however, that the findings tended to be consistent across </p>

<p> studies, indicating that the conclusions they suggest </p>

<p> about the effectiveness of the D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> are reliable. </p>

<p> What gaps in the D.A.R.E. assessments merit attention? </p>

<p> Our review of studies suggested several </p>

<p> methodological issues that should be addressed directly </p>

<p> and critically by future studies. These include the </p>

<p> complete and careful reporting of the research design and </p>

<p> results, contamination of the comparison group, the </p>

<p> appropriateness of the analysis strategy, and the control </p>

<p> and analysis of attrition. </p>

<p> Although most of the studies we reviewed documented </p>

<p> the research procedures and methods, some did not provide </p>

<p> sufficient detail. Thorough documentation is needed for </p>

<p> assessing and interpreting the results; information was </p>

<p> most often lacking in the description of the study </p>

<p> sample. In addition to the exact sample sizes of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison groups, sociodemographic </p>

<p> information such as whether recipients live in urban, </p>

<p> suburban, or rural areas, their racial/ethnic </p>

<p> composition, and their SES, should all be reported. This </p>

<p> information is needed for assessing the degree to which </p>

<p> study results may be generalized. It also can be used to </p>

<p> test whether D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness varies by </p>

<p> characteristics of the sample. For example, is D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> equally effective among inner-city, suburban, and rural </p>

<p> students and among white, African American, and Hispanic </p>

<p> students? Almost none of the studies we reviewed made </p>

<p> these sorts of assessments. Sociodemographic information </p>

<p> also is relevant when making comparisons between studies </p>

<p> (as we did between D.A.R.E. and other school-based drug </p>

<p> use prevention programs) in order to assess the </p>

<p> similarity of the recipients of programs being compared. </p>

<p> An issue related to the completeness of reporting </p>

<p> is the need for reports of research to be accessible to </p>

<p> all those interested in D.A.R.E., including sponsors, </p>

<p> educators, parents, police officers, other researchers, </p>

<p> and concerned citizens. Most of the studies we </p>

<p> identified were not reported in the published literature, </p>

<p> and therefore are not easily accessible. It is vitally </p>

<p> important that reports be made quickly and widely </p>

<p> available. As we have suggested earlier, we recommend </p>

<p> that a library of D.A.R.E. evaluation reports and </p>

<p> associated summaries of key findings be maintained by the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. America RTC Advisory Board. The extensive </p>

<p> communication channels between local, state, and national </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. entities should facilitate the prompt </p>

<p> identification and dissemination of evaluation studies. </p>

<p> One of the most important methodological issues </p>

<p> raised by our review is the potential contamination of </p>

<p> the control group by exposure to D.A.R.E. or to other </p>

<p> drug use prevention programs. Although none of the </p>

<p> comparison groups in the methodologically rigorous </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. studies was exposed to D.A.R.E. between pretest </p>

<p> and immediate posttest, contamination was an issue for </p>

<p> some studies conducting longer-term evaluations. This </p>

<p> contributed to our inability to evaluate D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness beyond immediate posttest. Ironically, </p>

<p> contamination is particularly problematic for D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> evaluations because of the rapid dissemination of the </p>

<p> program and because of the various curricula now </p>

<p> prevalent for students at different grade levels. It is </p>

<p> increasingly possible, for example, for a control group </p>

<p> not receiving the D.A.R.E. core curriculum to receive the </p>

<p> junior high school curriculum, effectively reducing its </p>

<p> utility as a control group. </p>

<p> A larger, but more subtle comparison group problem </p>

<p> is that the prevalence of school-based drug use </p>

<p> prevention programs in general makes it virtually </p>

<p> impossible to find a true &quot;no treatment&quot; control
group.=20 </p>

<p> Hence, when comparing D.A.R.E. to another drug education </p>

<p> program, effectiveness is determined on a comparative </p>

<p> rather than an absolute basis. For example, a finding of </p>

<p> little difference in effectiveness may indicate that both </p>

<p> programs are effective rather than that D.A.R.E. is of </p>

<p> limited effectiveness or both programs are ineffective.=20 </p>

<p> None of the studies we reviewed indicated whether the </p>

<p> control group received any drug use prevention </p>

<p> programming, much less provided information about it.=20 </p>

<p> Future studies should describe any prevention </p>

<p> interventions being delivered to the comparison group and </p>

<p> discuss the implications for the results. </p>

<p> An increasingly recognized methodological concern </p>

<p> in the evaluation of school-based interventions is the </p>

<p> importance of following an analysis strategy that is </p>

<p> appropriate to the study design (Moskowitz, 1993; Murray </p>

<p> &amp; Hannan, 1990). Only two of the methodologically </p>

<p> rigorous studies addressed this issue in the statistical </p>

<p> analyses. When D.A.R.E. is assigned by schools, which is </p>

<p> usually the case, or by classrooms rather than by </p>

<p> individuals, the analysis strategy must take into account </p>

<p> the correlations among students in the same school or </p>

<p> classroom. This requires performing analyses at the </p>

<p> aggregate level (e.g., through comparison of school or </p>

<p> classroom means) or by statistically correcting for </p>

<p> within-school or within-classroom correlations. Analyses </p>

<p> that do not account for the correlations among subjects </p>

<p> tend to underestimate the variability in outcomes across </p>

<p> schools and therefore overstate the statistical </p>

<p> significance of treatment effects (i.e., the difference </p>

<p> between the D.A.R.E. and control schools). Because </p>

<p> statistical significance is often used as an indicator of </p>

<p> effectiveness, this can artificially inflate the effects </p>

<p> and thus unfairly bias interpretation of the results. </p>

<p> Related to this issue is the need for sufficiently </p>

<p> large samples to provide adequate statistical power for </p>

<p> detecting significant differences between D.A.R.E. and </p>

<p> comparison groups. Most of the D.A.R.E. studies reviewed </p>

<p> had large numbers of students. However, because the </p>

<p> sample of interest, as described above, usually revolves </p>

<p> around schools as opposed to students, it is important </p>

<p> that sample size determinations in future studies be </p>

<p> based on analysis of the number of schools needed in </p>

<p> treatment and control conditions. </p>

<p> The final methodological issue raised by our review </p>

<p> of studies concerns the careful control and analysis of </p>

<p> study attrition. Attrition can affect both the external </p>

<p> and internal validity of the study. Attrition rates were </p>

<p> usually reported in the D.A.R.E. studies selected for </p>

<p> review. However, data on demographic and pretest </p>

<p> differences in drug use and other predictor measures </p>

<p> between those who remained in and those who dropped out </p>

<p> of the study were less frequently reported. Attrition </p>

<p> analyses can reveal whether subjects who were lost to </p>

<p> follow-up disproportionately represent drug users or </p>

<p> those at risk of drug use. When this is the case, it </p>

<p> compromises the external validity of the study by </p>

<p> limiting the population to which the study results may be </p>

<p> generalized. When differential attrition occurs by </p>

<p> experimental condition, for example, such that a larger </p>

<p> proportion of drug users is lost from the intervention </p>

<p> than the control group, the internal validity of the </p>

<p> study is undermined. That is, the extent to which either </p>

<p> positive or negative outcomes can be attributed to the </p>

<p> intervention is limited. </p>

<p> We recommend that all future D.A.R.E. evaluations </p>

<p> not only meet, but also exceed each of the methodological </p>

<p> criteria used for our review by addressing these </p>

<p> methodological issues. Specifically, in addition to </p>

<p> meeting the criteria used for this review, we recommend </p>

<p> that studies report sample demographics, draw a sample </p>

<p> with sufficient statistical power to detect differences </p>

<p> in outcomes, use an analysis strategy appropriate to the </p>

<p> way D.A.R.E. is assigned, minimize attrition, and analyze </p>

<p> differential attrition across treatment groups. In </p>

<p> addition, we strongly recommend the use of an </p>

<p> experimental research design, in which schools are </p>

<p> randomly assigned to either D.A.R.E. or control </p>

<p> conditions. It is probably insufficient to assign </p>

<p> classrooms at random within schools, because the </p>

<p> activities of D.A.R.E. officers outside the classroom may </p>

<p> affect (or &quot;contaminate&quot;) other classes. Although
there </p>

<p> frequently are difficulties inherent in using an </p>

<p> experimental design, results from experimental studies </p>

<p> always will be subject to fewer questions about validity </p>

<p> than those of quasi-experimental studies. A small set of </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. evaluations studies we reviewed used an </p>

<p> experimental study design and incorporated other </p>

<p> methodological features into the design. This level of </p>

<p> rigor is needed if future D.A.R.E. evaluation research is </p>

<p> to contribute further to knowledge about D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> effectiveness. </p>

<p> What overall assessment of D.A.R.E. do the study findings </p>

<p> suggest? </p>

<p> As described in Chapter 7, we used meta-analytic </p>

<p> techniques to synthesize and assess the findings of eight </p>

<p> methodologically rigorous studies of the original </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum. Our approach required </p>

<p> calculating individual study effect sizes for drug use </p>

<p> and other outcomes targeted by the core curriculum and </p>

<p> then averaging effect sizes across studies. Effect sizes </p>

<p> facilitate comparing and summarizing results across </p>

<p> studies because they transform the results of the </p>

<p> studies, which may have been derived from a wide variety </p>

<p> of statistical tests, to a common metric. Hence, in </p>

<p> terms of statistical output, the results of one study are </p>

<p> comparable with those of another study. Furthermore, </p>

<p> effect sizes are a more useful indicator of effectiveness </p>

<p> than comparing whether results are statistically </p>

<p> significant from one study to another. This is because </p>

<p> statistical significance can be influenced by such </p>

<p> factors as sample size and analysis strategy, making </p>

<p> comparisons problematic. </p>

<p> The magnitude of the effect sizes, when considered </p>

<p> both within each study and averaged across studies, </p>

<p> indicated that D.A.R.E. was most effective at immediate </p>

<p> posttest in increasing knowledge about drug use and in </p>

<p> enhancing social skills. The average effect sizes </p>

<p> reported for these outcomes were statistically </p>

<p> significant and larger than for other outcomes. It is </p>

<p> consistent with other meta-analyses for the largest </p>

<p> effect sizes to be associated with knowledge change, </p>

<p> supporting the general observation that knowledge is more </p>

<p> amenable to change than attitudes or behavior. Averaged </p>

<p> across studies, D.A.R.E. also had statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on attitudes about drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward the police, and self-esteem. The effect sizes </p>

<p> were smaller, however, than for knowledge and social </p>

<p> skills, indicating fewer meaningful changes in these </p>

<p> areas. </p>

<p> The smallest immediate effect sizes were for drug </p>

<p> use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana separately and </p>

<p> averaged together), and except for tobacco use, none was </p>

<p> statistically significant. In interpreting the small </p>

<p> magnitude of D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with respect to </p>

<p> drug use behavior, it is important to note that the </p>

<p> immediate effect sizes may reflect, at least in part, the </p>

<p> relatively low frequency of drug use by the elementary </p>

<p> school pupils targeted by the original core curriculum.=20 </p>

<p> The effect sizes probably also reflect the short time </p>

<p> interval from pretest to immediate posttest for behavior </p>

<p> change to occur. D.A.R.E. was more effective at </p>

<p> influencing factors believed to mediate drug use. It is </p>

<p> most noteworthy that D.A.R.E. had positive effects on </p>

<p> social skills because it is widely believed that children </p>

<p> with greater social competencies are more able to resist </p>

<p> social pressures to use drugs. Long-term impact of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., therefore, may result from D.A.R.E.'s immediate </p>

<p> impact on social skills. As described earlier, few </p>

<p> longer-term longitudinal studies have been conducted, and </p>

<p> some have been compromised by contamination of the </p>

<p> control group. However, based on two experimental </p>

<p> studies for which reliable information 1 and 2 years </p>

<p> after implementation is available, there is no evidence </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E.'s effects are activated when subjects are </p>

<p> older (Clayton et al., 1991b; Ennett et al., 1994). Most </p>

<p> long-term evaluations of drug use prevention programs </p>

<p> have shown that curriculum effects decay rather than </p>

<p> appear or increase with time (Ellickson et al., 1993; </p>

<p> Murray et al., 1989). </p>

<p> Future D.A.R.E. evaluation studies should continue </p>

<p> to assess drug use, attitudes about drug use, social </p>

<p> skills, and attitude toward police. Drug use indicators </p>

<p> should include tobacco (cigarettes and smokeless </p>

<p> tobacco), alcohol (particularly beer, wine, and wine </p>

<p> coolers), and marijuana. In addition, use of inhalants </p>

<p> and any other drugs that are locally prevalent should be </p>

<p> monitored. It is also important to continue to measure </p>

<p> outcomes targeted by the D.A.R.E. curriculum, such as </p>

<p> social skills, that are believed to indirectly influence </p>

<p> drug use. This requires linking outcome measures to </p>

<p> specific objectives addressed by the various lessons of </p>

<p> the curriculum. These data are needed for measuring a </p>

<p> variety of potentially important program effects other </p>

<p> than drug use behavior, and for testing assumptions about </p>

<p> the means by which the D.A.R.E. curriculum influences </p>

<p> drug use.=20 </p>

<p> For maximal usefulness, we further recommend that </p>

<p> effect sizes be routinely reported with the study results </p>

<p> to facilitate comparison both to the results of this </p>

<p> meta-analysis and those of future studies. As </p>

<p> demonstrated by this meta-analysis, effect sizes can be </p>

<p> readily calculated from a variety of statistical tests, </p>

<p> so this should not place an undue burden on researchers. </p>

<p> When the results of future D.A.R.E. evaluation </p>

<p> studies become available, they should be carefully </p>

<p> studied and compared with the results of the studies </p>

<p> reviewed here. As we recommended earlier, the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> America RTC Advisory Board could coordinate periodic </p>

<p> reviews of the evaluations. It is likely that ongoing </p>

<p> review of evaluation results will suggest areas where the </p>

<p> curriculum might need modification. </p>

<p> How well does D.A.R.E. address drug involvement by youth </p>

<p> in general? </p>

<p> The effect sizes discussed above indicate the </p>

<p> extent to which the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum </p>

<p> influenced drug use by youth and other outcomes at </p>

<p> immediate posttest. To put the D.A.R.E. results in </p>

<p> context, we compared D.A.R.E.'s effectiveness with that </p>

<p> of other school-based drug use prevention programs to </p>

<p> determine whether D.A.R.E. had greater, smaller, or </p>

<p> similar effects. Hence, we compared the average D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> effect sizes for drug use, knowledge, attitudes, and </p>

<p> skills to average effect sizes calculated for other </p>

<p> methodologically strong school-based drug use prevention </p>

<p> programs. We restricted the comparison programs to those </p>

<p> for upper elementary school pupils to make the </p>

<p> comparisons most meaningful. </p>

<p> We compared D.A.R.E. to two broad categories of </p>

<p> prevention programs, namely &quot;interactive&quot; and </p>

<p> &quot;noninteractive&quot; programs (Tobler, in press,
1994).=20 </p>

<p> These two program categories cover most types of current </p>

<p> school-based prevention efforts described in Chapter 2.=20 </p>

<p> Interactive programs generally are the same as the social </p>

<p> competence programs described in that chapter. These </p>

<p> programs represent the most recent advances in drug use </p>

<p> prevention strategies, and emphasize social competencies </p>

<p> and interactive teaching methods. Noninteractive </p>

<p> programs generally include knowledge and affective </p>

<p> programs, also described in Chapter 2. These programs </p>

<p> represent earlier approaches to drug education that </p>

<p> emphasize changing knowledge and attitudes about drug use </p>

<p> through more traditional learning styles. Interestingly, </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. shares similarities with both noninteractive and </p>

<p> interactive programs. The original core curriculum was </p>

<p> developed when prevention efforts were in transition </p>

<p> between noninteractive programs (knowledge and affective </p>

<p> education programs) and the emergence of interactive </p>

<p> programs (these emphasizing social influence). </p>

<p> Average D.A.R.E. immediate effect sizes were </p>

<p> greater, except for drug use, than the comparable average </p>

<p> effect sizes for noninteractive programs. The D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> effect sizes were smaller, however, than the effect sizes </p>

<p> for interactive programs. For drug use, the average </p>

<p> effect size for interactive programs was three times </p>

<p> greater than the average D.A.R.E. effect size; for social </p>

<p> skills, four times greater than for D.A.R.E.; and for </p>

<p> attitudes, three times greater. </p>

<p> Interactive programs have been shown to be the most </p>

<p> promising drug use prevention programs; noninteractive </p>

<p> programs generally have been shown to be less effective </p>

<p> (Botvin, 1990; Bruvold, 1993; Bruvold &amp; Rundall, 1988; </p>

<p> Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Because D.A.R.E. shares </p>

<p> features of both interactive and noninteractive programs, </p>

<p> it is perhaps not surprising that the effect sizes we </p>

<p> reported should fall somewhere between. </p>

<p> In Chapter 7, we described several methodological </p>

<p> reasons that could help account for the differences in </p>

<p> effect sizes between the D.A.R.E. studies and the </p>

<p> interactive comparison programs. These included the </p>

<p> possibility that the control groups in the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> studies were exposed to some sort of alternative drug </p>

<p> education programs, whereas the control groups for the </p>

<p> various interactive studies were not. Another possibil- </p>

<p> ity is that because the interactive programs were </p>

<p> primarily university research-based evaluation studies, </p>

<p> the evaluations--and programs themselves--may have been </p>

<p> more stringently implemented and more closely monitored.=20 </p>

<p> Under these conditions, greater effectiveness might be </p>

<p> expected than in real-world conditions, such as those </p>

<p> surrounding D.A.R.E. Other possibilities include factors </p>

<p> that may have varied across the intervention programs and </p>

<p> associated evaluation studies that contributed to the </p>

<p> observed differences in effect sizes. For example, </p>

<p> substantial variation in characteristics of the studients </p>

<p> (e.g., in race/ethnicity), features of the interventions </p>

<p> (e.g., variations in program intensity), and features of </p>

<p> the research design (e.g., experimental versus quasi- </p>

<p> experimental design) could have contributed to </p>

<p> differences in program effects. Such possibilities could </p>

<p> not be tested because of the small number of studies.=20 </p>

<p> Further testing is warranted when larger samples of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. and comparison studies are available. </p>

<p> It is also important to consider substantive </p>

<p> reasons that could account for the differences. Possible </p>

<p> explanations include the content of the original core </p>

<p> curriculum, the use of law enforcement officers as </p>

<p> instructors, and the more didactic approach of the </p>

<p> instruction. Consideration of each of these explanations </p>

<p> suggests areas for future research and possibly for </p>

<p> programmatic change. </p>

<p> As we have indicated, D.A.R.E.'s curriculum content </p>

<p> has similarities with both noninteractive and interactive </p>

<p> programs, although it has more of an intrapersonal focus </p>

<p> than most interactive programs and, conversely, more of a </p>

<p> skills focus than most noninteractive programs. Perhaps </p>

<p> greater emphasis in the D.A.R.E. core curriculum on </p>

<p> social influences, and less emphasis on affective </p>

<p> factors, might result in effect sizes nearer to those </p>

<p> reported from interactive programs. However, it is </p>

<p> difficult to speculate on the effect of altering the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum by adding or subtracting particular </p>

<p> lessons. Most evaluations of school-based prevention </p>

<p> programs have assessed the effectiveness of overall </p>

<p> programs rather than of the various program components or </p>

<p> combinations of components. Future research in this area </p>

<p> might suggest particular curriculum changes. </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. instruction offers another possible area </p>

<p> of explanation for D.A.R.E.'s relatively poorer </p>

<p> performance compared with interactive programs. Although </p>

<p> instruction by police officers is the sine qua non of the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum, their effectiveness may be less than </p>

<p> other possible program providers. For example, despite </p>

<p> the extensive D.A.R.E. training received by law </p>

<p> enforcement officers, they may not be as well equipped to </p>

<p> lead the curriculum as classroom teachers are. No </p>

<p> studies have been reported in which the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> curriculum was offered by anyone other than a police </p>

<p> officer; examination of the results from such a study </p>

<p> might suggest whether police officers are as effective as </p>

<p> other possible instructors. </p>

<p> Regardless of the leader, however, the generally </p>

<p> more traditional teaching style used by D.A.R.E. has not </p>

<p> been shown to be as effective as an interactive teaching </p>

<p> mode (Tobler, 1986, in press, 1994). Traditional </p>

<p> didactic approaches that involve teachers delivering </p>

<p> information, with little response from students, are </p>

<p> increasingly recognized as undesirable. More effective </p>

<p> are strategies that engage students in a dialogue with </p>

<p> the teacher; more effective still are cooperative or </p>

<p> participatory learning approaches in which the teacher </p>

<p> serves as a facilitator or catalyst to generate </p>

<p> discussions and other interactions among students.=20 </p>

<p> Although some D.A.R.E. activities encourage pupil </p>

<p> interaction, the original core curriculum relies heavily </p>

<p> on the officer as expert and makes frequent use of </p>

<p> lectures and question-answer sessions between the officer </p>

<p> and pupils. In fact, it is in teaching style, not </p>

<p> curriculum content, that D.A.R.E. differs most from the </p>

<p> interactive programs examined by Tobler. In the revised </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. core curriculum, there is greater emphasis on </p>

<p> such cooperative learning experiences. We recommend that </p>

<p> the D.A.R.E. training programs urge officers to employ </p>

<p> more interactive methods and provide specific guidance on </p>

<p> how they can do so. </p>

<p> What are the intended and unintended consequences of </p>

<p> D.A.R.E.'s approach to </p>

<p> drug abuse prevention? </p>

<p> None of the studies we reviewed examined </p>

<p> consequences of the D.A.R.E. program, either intended or </p>

<p> unintended, other than those related directly to the </p>

<p> curriculum. However, a number of consequences can be </p>

<p> envisioned. These include effects related to other </p>

<p> behaviors than drug use (e.g., effects on violent and </p>

<p> delinquent behavior). More likely, perhaps, may be </p>

<p> consequences related to the relationship that develops </p>

<p> between the D.A.R.E. officers and students, which may in </p>

<p> turn have positive consequences for police and community </p>

<p> relations in general. Research indicates that the </p>

<p> effects on police officers through their exposure to </p>

<p> students and the problems they face may also be </p>

<p> substantial and beneficial (D.A.R.E. Southeast Regional </p>

<p> Training Center, 1992). It is possible, in fact, that </p>

<p> some of D.A.R.E.'s most important effects are related to </p>

<p> the relations between students and police officers. The </p>

<p> studies we reviewed provided little insight into these </p>

<p> areas. This suggests the importance of research to </p>

<p> explore other consequences related to D.A.R.E.'s approach </p>

<p> to drug use prevention. </p>

<p> Conclusion </p>

<p> As might be expected of an institution as large as </p>

<p> D.A.R.E., our implementation and outcome assessments </p>

<p> present an array of findings and raise a number of issues </p>

<p> deserving of consideration by the D.A.R.E. organization </p>

<p> and all those concerned with this program. Perhaps most </p>

<p> prominently, the findings show a program that has been </p>

<p> extremely successful at placing drug education in our </p>

<p> Nation's schools. Indeed, D.A.R.E. is now implemented in </p>

<p> the majority of school districts in the country and is </p>

<p> expected to grow substantially in coming years. At the </p>

<p> same time, however, as our findings confirm D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> prevalence and popularity, they also suggest that the </p>

<p> original D.A.R.E. core curriculum has not been as </p>

<p> successful in accomplishing its mission to prevent drug </p>

<p> use among fifth and sixth graders as have interactive </p>

<p> programs. Review of the rigorous evaluations of the </p>

<p> original core curriculum, the heart of D.A.R.E., showed </p>

<p> that D.A.R.E. had only limited immediate effects on </p>

<p> students' drug use. Although the curriculum was more </p>

<p> successful in influencing other outcomes, such as social </p>

<p> skills, more work is needed to make D.A.R.E. more </p>

<p> effective as a drug use prevention program. </p>

<p> Given D.A.R.E.'s strengths, the task of increasing </p>

<p> the effectiveness of the core curriculum is feasible.=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. has achieved its accomplishments to date through </p>

<p> building a complex and solid organizational structure </p>

<p> that reaches from local to national levels, by forging </p>

<p> close partnerships between education and law enforcement, </p>

<p> and by winning substantial community support for the </p>

<p> program. In no other program of this magnitude have </p>

<p> school districts welcomed into the classroom outsiders </p>

<p> who lack traditional educational credentials to replace </p>

<p> teachers as instructors of a major curriculum. These </p>

<p> resources, as well as the dedication of the D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> officers in the classroom, should enable D.A.R.E. to move </p>

<p> forward more effectively to meet the challenges of drug </p>

<p> use prevention. In this final section of our assessment, </p>

<p> we briefly recapitulate our major findings and </p>

<p> recommendations. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's prevalence. D.A.R.E. is now </p>

<p> implemented in over half the school districts in the </p>

<p> country and is expected to grow substantially in the </p>

<p> coming years. Because it is least prevalent in small and </p>

<p> rural school districts, we believe that ways for these </p>

<p> school districts to increase access to D.A.R.E. should be </p>

<p> examined. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's organization. D.A.R.E. is at once </p>

<p> both hierarchical and community-based. Although it is </p>

<p> carefully controlled, monitored, and overseen at the </p>

<p> national, regional, and State levels, it is also very </p>

<p> much a grass-roots movement, dependent on local </p>

<p> initiatives to form partnerships and secure support. At </p>

<p> the State level and above, we suggest that sufficient </p>

<p> resources be made available to support this burgeoning </p>

<p> organization to ensure adequate authority, communication, </p>

<p> technical assistance, and oversight. At the local level, </p>

<p> we believe that alternative sources of support should be </p>

<p> explored so that D.A.R.E. can be freed as much as </p>

<p> possible from dependence on public funds. =20 </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. 's partnership with education. Law </p>

<p> enforcement's relationship with education is the </p>

<p> cornerstone of D.A.R.E. We believe that at all levels a </p>

<p> variety of mechanisms could be instituted to strengthen </p>

<p> this critical partnership. This includes improving </p>

<p> methods for co-teaching D.A.R.E. at the local level, as </p>

<p> well as increasing where possible the already </p>

<p> multifaceted involvement of D.A.R.E. officers in school </p>

<p> life. We also suggest ensuring adequate representation </p>

<p> on advisory boards by staff of departments of education </p>

<p> at the State and national levels. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> Popular support for D.A.R.E. Anecdotal evidence </p>

<p> of grass-roots support for D.A.R.E. is abundant and is </p>

<p> fully confirmed in our study. School-based drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators tended to rate school staff's </p>

<p> attitudes toward D.A.R.E. as well as those of students, </p>

<p> the parents, and the community as very supportive. The </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. curriculum and students' receptivity to the </p>

<p> program, and perhaps most important, D.A.R.E.'s effects </p>

<p> on students were rated as very satisfactory. This </p>

<p> persuasive evidence suggests that whatever modifications </p>

<p> and enhancements may be made to the D.A.R.E. curriculum </p>

<p> and how the program is taught, D.A.R.E.'s organization </p>

<p> and structure at the local level is sound and should be </p>

<p> preserved. </p>

<p> =20 </p>

<p> The original D.A.R.E. core curricula. Drug </p>

<p> prevention coordinators' endorsements of D.A.R.E.'s </p>

<p> positive effects on students are generally not supported </p>

<p> by the results of the methodologically sound short-term </p>

<p> evaluations of the original D.A.R.E. core curriculum we </p>

<p> summarized. As indicated earlier, D.A.R.E. demonstrated </p>

<p> somewhat greater effects than those of didactic </p>

<p> school-based drug prevention methods that are based on </p>

<p> affective approaches, but considerably fewer effects than </p>

<p> those of interactive methods that use social influence </p>

<p> approaches. </p>

<p> Because D.A.R.E. already incorporates many </p>

<p> interactive features, we believe that appropriate </p>

<p> modifications can be made both to the core curriculum and </p>

<p> to the way D.A.R.E. is taught that are well within the </p>

<p> context of the institution as a whole. These </p>

<p> modifications should be made periodically (perhaps every </p>

<p> 2 years), as refinements are suggested by evaluations of </p>

<p> drug prevention programs in general, and of D.A.R.E.
inparticular. We comm= </p>

<p> end </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. for convening a </p>

<p> Scientific Advisory Committee that comprises drug </p>

<p> prevention specialists who will review relevant drug </p>

<p> prevention research findings and make recommendations </p>

<p> concerning improvements to the curricula.=20 </p>

<p> In conclusion, D.A.R.E. represents an institution </p>

<p> that is unique in the area of drug use prevention: a </p>

<p> partnership between law enforcement and education that </p>

<p> has the substantial support of children, parents, and the </p>

<p> community at large. Not unexpectedly, along with this </p>

<p> highly visible profile come high expectations. Our </p>

<p> report demonstrates D.A.R.E.'s success in meeting many of </p>

<p> these expectations, as well as challenges that lie ahead.=20 </p>

<p> Key to the continued growth of D.A.R.E. will be careful </p>

<p> monitoring of the effectiveness of the various curricula, </p>

<p> coupled with the willingness to make and assess </p>

<p> modifications that could enhance effectiveness. D.A.R.E. </p>

<p> has already demonstrated its responsiveness to change by </p>

<p> the introduction of new curricula, revisions to the core </p>

<p> curriculum, and expanded roles for D.A.R.E. officers.=20 </p>

<p> Equally important to D.A.R.E.'s viability will be its </p>

<p> continued coordination of the roles and responsibilities </p>

<p> of the many D.A.R.E. players. In both of these efforts, </p>

<p> we recommend that D.A.R.E. seek to strengthen its </p>

<p> partnerships with individuals and institutions outside </p>

<p> its bounds. The advice, support, and perspectives of </p>

<p> those who are not part of the D.A.R.E. structure but who </p>

<p> are equally committed to drug use prevention will enhance </p>

<p> the vitality and integrity of the program. We believe </p>

<p> these efforts will result in a program that maintains its </p>

<p> unique identity and place in drug education, while </p>

<p> meeting more effectively the challenge of reducing drug </p>

<p> use among youth. </p>

<p> Appendix B </p>

<p> Individual Study Descriptions </p>

<p> Brief descriptions of the eight methodologically rigorous
studies </p>

<p> selected for the meta-analysis are given below in </p>

<p> alphabetical order by the location of the study. The </p>

<p> research design, sample size and characteristics, and </p>

<p> results for drug use knowledge, attitudes about drug use, </p>

<p> social skills, self-esteem, attitude toward police, and </p>

<p> drug use behavior are reported. Additional information </p>

<p> and greater detail about the study methodologies and </p>

<p> results are available in the reports or papers issued by </p>

<p> each study. </p>

<p> 1.British Columbia </p>

<p> The British Columbia evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Walker, 1990)
used a </p>

<p> quasi-experimental design in which seven schools were </p>

<p> assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and four schools with </p>

<p> similar demographic characteristics were selected for the </p>

<p> comparison condition. The study administered an </p>

<p> anonymous pretest and immediate posttest; assessed </p>

<p> pretest equivalence on some demographic variables and all </p>

<p> outcome variables; and controlled for pretest values on </p>

<p> outcome variables by analyzing change scores at the </p>

<p> aggregate level. The sample included 463 fifth-, sixth-, </p>

<p> and seventh-grade pupils. No information was given on </p>

<p> the ethnic composition of the sample. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect on subjects' knowledge about drugs. D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have a statistically significant effect on attitudes </p>

<p> about drug use or on drug use behavior (use of tobacco, </p>

<p> beer, pop, marijuana, acid, valium, wine, aspirin, </p>

<p> uppers, downers, heroin, crack, liquor, candy, glue, and </p>

<p> PCP). </p>

<p> 2. Hawaii </p>

<p> The Hawaii evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Manos, Kameoka, &amp;
Tanji, 1986) </p>

<p> used a quasi-experimental research design in which 23 </p>

<p> schools were assigned to either D.A.R.E. or comparison </p>

<p> conditions. In three other schools, some classrooms were </p>

<p> assigned to D.A.R.E. and other classrooms to the </p>

<p> comparison condition; data from these comparison </p>

<p> classrooms were not included in our analysis. The study </p>

<p> administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used some measures </p>

<p> that were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables. The sample included 2,009 fifth-grade pupils </p>

<p> (not including the pupils in comparison classrooms in the </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. schools). No information was given on the </p>

<p> ethnic composition of the sample. Attrition was not </p>

<p> analyzed but was approximately 6%. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect in the desired direction on one social skills </p>

<p> indicator (choices in a risk situation). D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have statistically significant effects on another </p>

<p> social skills indicator (assertiveness) or on subjects' </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use. </p>

<p> 3. Illinois-C </p>

<p> The Illinois-C evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ennett, Rosenbaum, </p>

<p> Flewelling, Bieler, Ringwalt, &amp; Bailey, 1994) used both </p>

<p> an experimental and quasi-experimental design: 12 pairs </p>

<p> of schools serving urban and suburban areas were randomly </p>

<p> assigned to D.A.R.E. and control conditions, while 6 </p>

<p> pairs serving rural areas were assigned using a nonrandom </p>

<p> procedure. The study matched schools on metropolitan </p>

<p> status, ethnic composition, number of students with </p>

<p> English proficiency, and percentage of pupils from low- </p>

<p> income families; administered a pretest and three </p>

<p> posttests (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after </p>

<p> implementation); matched subjects from pretest to </p>

<p> posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or </p>

<p> derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest </p>

<p> values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence </p>

<p> between the comparison groups; adjusted for school </p>

<p> effects with a nested cohort strategy; and assessed </p>

<p> attrition. The sample included 1,323 subjects who were </p>

<p> fifth and sixth graders at pretest; 54% were white, 22% </p>

<p> were African American, 9% Hispanic, and 15% were American </p>

<p> Indian, Asian American, or &quot;other.&quot; The attrition
rate </p>

<p> over the three posttests was 26% and did not differ </p>

<p> across experimental conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' self- </p>

<p> esteem, attitude toward police, and increased use of </p>

<p> cigarettes at immediate posttest. D.A.R.E. did not have </p>

<p> statistically significant effects on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward use of specific drugs, perceived benefits of </p>

<p> cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived costs of </p>

<p> cigarette use and alcohol use; perceived media influence </p>

<p> on smoking and beer drinking); social skills </p>

<p> (assertiveness and peer refusal skills); or on other drug </p>

<p> use behavior (initiation of alcohol, cigarettes, or heavy </p>

<p> drinking; increased use of alcohol or heavy drinking; or </p>

<p> quitting alcohol). </p>

<p> 4. Kentucky-A </p>

<p> The Kentucky-A evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Clayton, Cattarello,
Day, </p>

<p> &amp; Walden, 1991a; Clayton, Cattarello, &amp; Walden,
1991b) </p>

<p> used an experimental design employing random assignment </p>

<p> of 31 schools to either D.A.R.E. or control conditions.=20 </p>

<p> The study administered a pretest and three posttests </p>

<p> (immediately, 1 year, and 2 years after implementation); </p>

<p> matched subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures </p>

<p> that were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables and initial nonequivalence between the </p>

<p> comparison groups; and assessed attrition. The sample </p>

<p> included 1,925 subjects who were sixth graders at </p>

<p> pretest; 76% were white and 21% were African American.=20 </p>

<p> The attrition rate over the three posttests was </p>

<p> approximately 21% and did not differ across experimental </p>

<p> conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that, at immediate posttest, D.A.R.E. had </p>

<p> statistically significant effects in the desired </p>

<p> direction on some indicators of subjects' attitudes about </p>

<p> drugs (general attitudes about drugs and negative </p>

<p> attitudes about alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana).=20 </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. did not have statistically significant effects </p>

<p> at immediate posttest on other indicators of subjects' </p>

<p> attitudes about drug use (positive attitudes about </p>

<p> alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana), social skills, self- </p>

<p> esteem, or drug use behavior (use of alcohol, cigarettes, </p>

<p> and marijuana). </p>

<p> 5. Kentucky-B </p>

<p> The Kentucky-B evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Faine &amp; Bohlander
1988, </p>

<p> 1989) used a quasi-experimental research design in which </p>

<p> 16 schools, stratified by school type (rural, inner-city, </p>

<p> suburban, and parochial), were randomly selected among </p>

<p> schools assigned to receive D.A.R.E. immediately or at a </p>

<p> later semester (a delayed intervention comparison group).=20 </p>

<p> The study administered a pretest and two posttests </p>

<p> (immediately and one year after implementation); matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that </p>

<p> were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; and controlled for pretest values on outcome </p>

<p> variables and type of school. The sample in the first </p>

<p> year included 783 fifth-grade pupils; sample demographic </p>

<p> characteristics were not given. Attrition information </p>

<p> was not given. By year 2, all the comparison groups had </p>

<p> received the D.A.R.E. program. </p>

<p> The immediate posttest results showed that D.A.R.E. had </p>

<p> statistically significant effects in the desired </p>

<p> direction on subjects' knowledge about drugs, attitudes </p>

<p> about drug use, social skills, self-esteem, and attitude </p>

<p> toward police. </p>

<p> 6. Minnesota </p>

<p> The Minnesota evaluation of D.A.R.E. (McCormick &amp;
McCormick, </p>

<p> 1992) used a quasi-experimental research design in which </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. was implemented by semester in 63 schools; </p>

<p> random samples of D.A.R.E. participants and pupils who </p>

<p> would receive D.A.R.E. in the next semester (a delayed </p>

<p> intervention comparison group) were drawn. The study </p>

<p> administered a pretest and immediate posttest; matched </p>

<p> subjects from pretest to posttest; used measures that </p>

<p> were standardized scales or derived from existing </p>

<p> measures; assessed pretest equivalence on selected </p>

<p> demographic variables; and controlled for pretest values </p>

<p> on outcome variables. The sample included 943 fifth </p>

<p> graders; 62% of the D.A.R.E. group participants were </p>

<p> white; 18% Asian Americans, 12% African American, and 7% </p>

<p> Native American or Hispanic (demographic information on </p>

<p> the comparison group was not given). The attrition rate </p>

<p> was 9%. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had a statistically
significant </p>

<p> effect in the desired direction on subjects' knowledge </p>

<p> about drugs. D.A.R.E. did not have statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on subjects' attitudes about drug </p>

<p> use, social skills, self-esteem, or attitude toward </p>

<p> police. </p>

<p> 7. North Carolina </p>

<p> The North Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Ringwalt, Ennett,
&amp; </p>

<p> Holt, 1991) used an experimental research design </p>

<p> employing random assignment of 20 schools to either </p>

<p> D.A.R.E. or control conditions. The study administered a </p>

<p> pretest and immediate posttest; matched subjects from </p>

<p> pretest to posttest; used measures that were standardized </p>

<p> scales or derived from existing measures; controlled for </p>

<p> pretest values on outcome variables and initial </p>

<p> nonequivalence between the comparison groups; adjusted </p>

<p> for school effects; and assessed attrition. The sample </p>

<p> included 1,270 fifth- and sixth-grade students; 50% were </p>

<p> African American, 40% were white, and 10% were American </p>

<p> Indian, Asian American, or Hispanic. The attrition rate </p>

<p> was 9% and did not differ across experimental conditions. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs (general attitude toward drugs, attitude </p>

<p> toward use of specific drugs, perceived peer attitude </p>

<p> toward drug use, perceived costs of using alcohol and </p>

<p> cigarettes, and perceptions of the media portrayal of </p>

<p> beer drinking and cigarette smoking) and social skills </p>

<p> (assertiveness). D.A.R.E. did not have statistically </p>

<p> significant effects on subjects' drug use behavior </p>

<p> (alcohol, cigarettes, or inhalant use). </p>

<p> 8. South Carolina </p>

<p> The South Carolina evaluation of D.A.R.E. (Harmon, 1993) used
a </p>

<p> quasi-experimental research design in which five schools </p>

<p> were assigned to receive D.A.R.E. and six schools matched </p>

<p> on demographic characteristics were selected for the </p>

<p> comparison condition. The study administered a pretest </p>

<p> and immediate posttest; matched subjects from pretest to </p>

<p> posttest; used measures that were standardized scales or </p>

<p> derived from existing measures; controlled for pretest </p>

<p> values on outcome variables and initial nonequivalence </p>

<p> between the comparison groups; and assessed attrition.=20 </p>

<p> The sample included 602 fifth-grade pupils. The </p>

<p> attrition rate was 13.5% in the D.A.R.E. group and 16.3% </p>

<p> in the comparison groups. </p>

<p> The results showed that D.A.R.E. had statistically
significant </p>

<p> effects in the desired direction on subjects' attitudes </p>

<p> about drugs, social skills (assertiveness), and </p>

<p> initiation of alcohol use in the past year. D.A.R.E. did </p>

<p> not have statistically significant effects on subjects' </p>

<p> self-esteem, attitude toward police, or other drug use </p>

<p> behavior indicators (previous year tobacco and marijuana </p>

<p> use, and previous month cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana </p>

<p> use). </p>
