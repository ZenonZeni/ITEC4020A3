<CENTER><h2>Questions and Answers About the Eco-Escuela</h2></CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>


<BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><b><i>How old is the Eco-Escuela?</i></b> </p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela was officially opened in March of 1993 and has received
over 500 students. </p>

<p><b><i>Who typically attends the Eco-Escuela program?</i></b> </p>

<p>There is no &quot;typical&quot; Eco-Escuela student. The school has
received students ranging in age from 18-73, the majority of whom fall
between the ages of 22 and 35. Individuals come from many different backgrounds
and parts of the world. </p>

<p><b><i>Does the program focus more on language instruction or environmental
issues?</i></b> </p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela is first and foremost a Spanish language school. Education
about the environmental issues and ecology of the Petén is integrated into
the structure of the daily classes (i.e. interpretive forest walks, class
field trips, teacher-student conversation), and activities outside of class
(such as evening lectures, volunteering, and weekend excursions). Students
are invited, but not required, to become involved in the ecological aspects
of the program. </p>

<p><b><i>How long should I stay?</i></b> </p>

<p>Because classes are held in weekly increments, the program is flexible
according to each student's needs and travel schedule. Your length of stay
will depend on: the amount of time you have available, your learning capacity
(whether you are a quick learner or need that extra time), and what you
want to get out of the program. In the past, students have stayed from
one week to four months. </p>

<p><b><i>Can I stay in the same house with my spouse or travel companion?</i></b></p>

<p>There are several homestay families that can provide housing for couples
and/or friends. Although these accommodations cannot be guaranteed at the
time of making reservations, the Eco-Escuela will make every effort to
accommodate such requests. Please keep in mind that students tend to learn
Spanish faster when they are not in constant contact with friends they
may be tempted to speak to in their native language. It may be to your
advantage to avoid these situations by living in separate households, (keeping
in mind that all homestays are within walking distance). </p>

<p><b><i>Is it safe in San Andrés, Guatemala?</i></b> </p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela is unaware of any occurances of threats to the personal
safety of past students while living in San Andrés. Tourism is a foundation
of the Petenero economy, and the local people recognize the importance
of accepting foreigners. However, individuals should always take necessary
safety precautions when travelling in a foreign country. For recorded travel
information about the country of Guatemala call the U.S. Department of
State at (202)647-5225. </p>

<p><b><i>What options do I have if I choose not to stay with a host family?</i></b>
</p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela strongly recommends that students take advantage of
the opportunity to share in the lives, customs, and language of a San Andrés
family. Most students identify their homestay as the most rewarding part
of their Eco-Escuela experience. Also, by staying with a family, you are
supporting the school's mission of creating alternative forms of income
for local people. It is rare that a student opts not to stay with a family,
but if you should, there is one small inn in San Andrés and many others
in nearby Flores and Santa Elena. We advise that students stay in San Andrés
in order to avoid inconvenient differences in transportation and class
schedules. </p>

<p><b><i>Can I receive college credit?</i></b> </p>

<p>Although the Eco-Escuela does not offer college credit, many students
are able to make special arrangements through their schools to receive
credit for their studies and experience at the Eco-Escuela. </p>

<p><b><i>How far in advance do I need to register?</i></b> </p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela prefers students to register at least 3 weeks in advance,
although we do accept last minute reservations according to space availability.
The school has a limit of 24 students at one time. To guarantee your space,
early registration is recommended. </p>

<p><b><i>What qualifications do Eco-Escuela teachers hold?</i></b> </p>

<p>Eco-Escuela teachers have been certified under the Guatemala education
system as teachers and have been specially trained in teaching Spanish
to non-native speakers. </p>

<p><b><i>What books are used at the school? Should I bring my own?</i></b>
</p>

<p>The Eco-Escuela has no specific book that it uses in class. Different
materials are used for different students. If you have a certain book or
workbook that you use or would like to use in class, please feel free to
bring it. </p>

<p><b><i>What is acceptable dress in San Andrés?</i></b> </p>

<p>Classes are casual. Most clothes are acceptable in San Andrés, although
we would recommend that students avoid wearing short shorts or skirts,
or halter tops. Use your own discretion while maintaining cultural sensitivity.
</p>

<p><b><i>How much money should I bring?</i></b> </p>

<p>If you choose to live with a host family, all of your lodging and food
are paid for while you are enrolled in the Eco-Escuela. These expenses
would normally be the majority of your spending while traveling. Added
expenses may include: optional weekend excursions (ranging from $10-30),
personal travel to sights such as Tikal, soda/beer/bottled water and snacks,
souvenirs and crafts. In general, travel, food, and lodging are very cheap
in Guatemala. Travelers cheques are accepted in most banks and hotels.
Access/Mastercard, American Express, Visa/Barclycard are accepted in some
hotels and few restaurants. Cash advances are available from a limited
number of banks. If you will be staying for several months, you may wish
to consider opening a bank account. </p>

<p><b><i>Should I bring my homestay family a gift?</i></b> </p>

<p>It is always nice to give your family a little something as a sign of
your appreciation, but by no means are you obligated to do so. Gifts in
the past have included children's toys, frisbees, crayons, markers, flashlights,
picture books of your home state/country, something native of your state/country,
t-shirts, and mugs. Be creative, yet conservative. Bring pictures of your
family to share with your host family. </p>

<p><b><i>What kind of volunteer opportunities can students become involved
in?</i></b> </p>

<p>Interested students are encouraged to participate in volunteer activities
twice a week in the afternoons. Activities change according to what projects
in the area are looking for assistance and what projects the school itself
is working on. In the past students have worked to: </p>

<ul>
<li>create a garbage pick-up within the community that has markedly decreased
the level of litter and increased community awareness about pollution;
</li>

<li>create an &quot;Interpretive Trail&quot; used by students of the Eco-Escuela
and all San Andrés public schools as an educational tool where students
can learn about the forest's plants and their traditional uses; </li>

<li>build bungalows at the public beach where students and community members
can relax or study in the shade after taking a dip in Lake Petén Itzá;
</li>

<li>ensure the growth of saplings in a reforestation project by clearing
areas of menacing overgrowth; and </li>

<li>create a better learning environment for the children of San Andrés
by helping to build, repair, and clean classrooms, chairs, desks, etc.
in local schools. </li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Do I need a visa to enter Guatemala?</i></b> </p>

<p>To travel to Guatemala U.S. citizens must have a passport and either
a tourist card or a visa. Tourist cards or visas are valid for at least
thirty days and can allow you to stay in the country for up to ninety days.
Both can be extended at the immigration department in Guatemala City or
renewed by leaving and reentering the country. U.S. citizens must carry
identification with them at all times. Tourist cards cost US$5.00 and can
be purchased upon arrival at the airport in Guatemala, at the Guatemalan
border, or at the airport departure gate for flights from the U.S. to Guatemala.
If you are a British, US, or Canadian citizen, you need only a tourist
card and passport to enter the country if entering by air. </p>

<p>Visas are available from the Embassy of Guatemala at 2220 R Street,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, tel: (202) 745-4952, or Guatemalan Consulates
in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, New Orleans, New York, Houston or
Chicago. Non-U.S. citizens should contact a Guatemalan Consulate in their
country for information on entry requirements. </p></BLOCKQUOTE>
