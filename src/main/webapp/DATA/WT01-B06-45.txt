Life Cycle Investing: Your Personal Investment Profile</H2></P>

<HR>

No two investors are alike either in terms of personality or in their own financial situations. So why should their investment plans be similar?<P>


In fact, they should not be. Instead, an individual's investment plan should be tailored to his own personal investment profile. There are four basic aspects that compose an investor's personal investment profile:<P>


<UL><LI>Your personal tolerance for risk


<LI>Return needs and whether current income or future growth needs to be emphasized


<LI>Time horizon


<LI>Tax exposure
</UL>

The amount of risk you are willing to take on is an extremely important factor to consider before making an investment because of the severe consequences of taking on too much risk. Risk is uncertainty--the possibility that the investment won't perform as expected. Properly assessing risk tolerance is designed to prevent an investor from making panic decisions and abandoning an investment plan mid-stream at the worst possible time.<P>


How can tolerance be measured? The best approach is to simply examine the worst-case scenario--a loss over a one-year period--and ask yourself whether you could stick with your investment plan in the face of such a loss.<P>


Investors with a low tolerance for risk generally can sustain losses of no more than 5% over a one-year period. Investors with a moderate tolerance for risk can generally withstand losses of between 6% to 15% over a one-year period. Investors with a high tolerance for risk can generally withstand losses of 16% to 25% over one year.<P>


Determining your return needs is important because you can't have all of everything--there is no investment that offers a high certain payout each year, protects your principal and offers a high potential for growth.<P>


There are a number of trade-offs, based on the risk/return trade-off. First, the price for principal protection is lower returns, usually in the form of lower annual income. There is also a trade-off between income and growth: The more certain the annual payment, the less risky the investment, and therefore the lower the potential return in the form of growth.<P>


The length of time you will or can be invested is important because it can directly affect your ability to reduce risk. Time diversification is most critical for volatile investments such as stocks, where prices fluctuate greatly over the short term, but are considerably smoothed over longer time periods.<P>


If your time horizon is short, you cannot effectively be diversified across different market environments. Longer time horizons allow you to take on greater risks--with a greater return potential--because some of that risk can be reduced through time diversification.<P>


How should time horizon be measured? Your time horizon starts with whenever your investment portfolio is implemented, and ends when you will need to take the money out of your investment portfolio.<P>


If you are investing to save for a specific event, such as tuition payments or the purchase of a house, your time horizon is fairly easily measured--it ends when you need the cash. If you are investing to accumulate a sum for periodic withdrawals, such as during retirement, your time horizon is more difficult to quantify as you approach the time that withdrawals will begin.<P>


What constitutes short-, intermediate and long-term time horizons?<P>


To diversify over various economic cycles, you must be invested through one complete economic cycle at the very least. In general, the economic cycle lasts about five years, which can be considered a long-term horizon.  <P>


Conversely, if you need money within a year or two, you have a short-term horizon. A somewhat longer-term outlook--two to five years--constitutes an intermediate-term horizon.<P>


The bottom line to all investors is what's left after taxes. Investors who are in higher income tax brackets need to be concerned with the tax implications of their investments. Investors who are in lower income tax brackets need to worry less about the tax implications, but they also need to avoid securities that benefit high tax-exposure investors, such as municipal bonds.<P>


With the tax laws changing regularly, it is difficult to quantify what constitutes "higher" and "lower" tax exposure (perhaps the terms should be changed to "high" and "even higher"). However, if your annual income level puts you within the top federal income tax categories, you fall within the "higher" category.<P>


Clearly different investors have different profiles. But the same individual will also have different profiles at different stages in life. For instance, your tolerance for risk may change as you get older, as you acquire more assets and as you become more financially secure. When you approach retirement, your time horizon may shift and become a blend of long-term and medium- or short-term needs.<P>


Table 1 shows how an investor's profile may change. Of course, your own profile may be very different than this one; it may even fit one of those listed here, such as early retirement, even though you are in a different stage, such as early career. <P> 


An effective investment plan is based on a balance between the risks you are willing to take on and the returns you need to achieve your goals. An understanding of your investment profile will help you achieve that balance.<P>
