<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
February 29, 1996</I>

<P>

The growth rate of the U.S. economy slowed to only about 0.9% during the fourth quarter from 3.6% during the third quarter and 0.6% during the first half of the year.
<P>

<B>The most distressing feature of the fourth quarter report was the weakness of domestic final sales.</B> They expanded at only a 0.6% annual rate compared to 2.6% during the third quarter. But the fourth quarter data was depressed by special factors which should reverse during the first half of 1996. The Boeing strike produced a 10% decline in aircraft spending. Real federal government spending fell at a 12% annual rate because of the government shutdown late in the year. The government shut-down probably also contributed to weakness in private spending which requires government authorization, such as construction projects in environmentally sensitive areas of the west and exports of high technology goods with military potential.
<P>

On the basis of preliminary data, one of the weakest sectors of the economy during the fourth quarter was consumer spending. It grew at an annual rate of only 0.8% compared to 2.8% during the third quarter and 3.4% during the second quarter. But newly revised retail sales suggests that the growth rate of consumer spending was probably about 1.3% while the weakness of spending was heavily concentrated in October. January retail sales fell sharply because of severe weather and the shutdown of several federal agencies during the previous month (furloughed workers lost their paychecks for several weeks) but survey data for February suggests that consumer spending is now improving. If consumer spending is recovering, the economy should be able to complete its inventory adjustment during the current quarter and return to a growth rate of 2.0-3.0% during the second quarter.
<P>

Surveys of business confidence suggest that the corporate sector remains confident despite the weakness of the economy during the fourth quarter. According to the latest Dun and Bradstreet survey, corporate executives expect sales to improve during April after three months of weakness recently. The D&#38;B survey of new orders rose to 48 in January from 45 in December and 33 in November. Surveys of small business confidence are also generally positive. The January survey of National Federation of Independent Business noted,
<P>

<I>"The index of Small Business Optimism dropped 2.5 points in December from its highest reading in the expansion. The December reading of 101.5 is just 0.4 points below the average for the year of 101.9. The November 'sales bubble' burst in December and sales slipped to a mediocre level. The strong fourth quarter of 1994, which saw a good Christmas shopping season, culminated a year in which 3.3 million net new jobs were formed. Although the economy stayed close to this high employment level, it was not able to follow with yet another strong year of job creation in spite of record-high hiring plans in January. Without the buying power generated by the same volume of <B>new</B> paychecks, it was unlikely that the 1995 holiday season could significantly better the 1994 season in <B>nominal dollar terms</B>. But <B>in real terms</B>, the 1995 season might actually be better than 1994 because year-over-year, there was probably zero retail price inflation."</I>
<P>

The resilience of the small business sector is important because it accounts for most of the employment creation in the U.S. economy. The Manpower Employment Survey is cautious about hiring during the second quarter but in the NFIB survey, small business continues to report labor scarcity in many regions. Twenty-two percent of small firms have jobs which are hard to fill.
<P>

The buoyancy of U.S. financial markets should help to bolster consumer and business spending. The household sector has become a major beneficiary of rising equity prices because of its large holdings of mutual funds. In January, it owned $1.3 trillion of equity mutual funds compared to $418 billion in early 1992 and $811 billion of bond funds compared to $449 billion in early 1992. The total value of savings accounts, small time deposits, and retail money market funds, by contrast, is $2.597 trillion. <B>The mutual fund industry has grown so dramatically during recent years that its assets excluding money market funds will soon exceed the $2.3 trillion of assets in the country's national banks.</B> If we include retail money market funds, the mutual fund industry is now larger than the national banking system. 
<P>

The growth of the mutual fund industry has resulted from both changes in household savings flows and stock market appreciation. In January, the market capitalization of America's 7551 listed companies (including preferred stock) was about $6.63 trillion compared to $5 trillion (6925 companies) in January, 1994 and $3.957 trillion (5608 companies) in January 1992. <B>The ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has risen to 87.5% compared to a previous all time high of 81.0% in 1929 and a post war peak of 79.0% in 1968.</B> The all time trough of stock market capitalization to GDP was 16.0% in 1941 while in the post war era it was 30% in 1974 and 1982. The average ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP since 1926 has been 48.0%. At first glance, the U.S. market appears to be as frothy as the Tokyo market in the late 1980's, when Japan's ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP rose to 130% from an average of 20-30% during the 1970's and early 1980's (this about 65% today). But since the U.S. corporate sector now has about one fifth of its output in other countries, the ratio of stock market capitalization of GDP should probably be adjusted to include the $1.6 trillion of sales which U.S. firms have in other countries. <B>If we adjust the U.S. market capitalization/GDP ratio for foreign sales, it drops to about 74% from 87.5%.</B> This ratio is still high but the fact remains that U.S. firms now have global sales opportunities on a scale unprecedented in economic history. At the peak of the Tokyo bull market, by contrast, Japanese firms had only about 7% of their output in foreign countries.
<P>

American investment spending will also benefit from rising equity prices by lowering the cost of business capital. At present, the ratio of equity prices to asset replacement costs for U.S. firms is about 1.7 or the highest level ever recorded in the modern era. The high value of equity in the U.S. stock market makes it possible for firms to finance new capital spending on attractive terms while enhancing the appeal of greenfield investment compared to corporate takeover activity.
<P>

<B>Inventory spending will probably be a drag on the economy during the first quarter but it should turn into a positive growth stimulant during the second quarter.</B> In the fourth quarter, firms reduced the rate of real non-farm inventory accumulation to $23.6 billion from $38.3 billion during the third quarter and $33.8 billion during the second quarter. The weakness of the purchasing agent survey during January suggests that real non-farm inventory accumulation could decline further during the first quarter of 1996. The total index fell to 44.2 from 46.0 during January while the new order component slid to 41.8 from 45.4. The inventory index increased to 47.7 from 44.2 but it is difficult to imagine that such gains were voluntary at a time when final demand was depressed by the weather and the federal government shut-down. Manufacturing inventories rose during the fourth quarter while retail and wholesale inventories fell. The weakness of final sales during January suggests that manufacturing inventories should decline further during the first quarter.
<P>

The major new risk facing the economy is rising bond yields. They have increased sharply because of investor concern about the fragmentation of the Republican Party in recent primaries, the apparent collapse of deficit reduction talks in Washington, and the disappointment of some aggressive investors about the economy avoiding a full scale recession this spring. If bond yields continue to increase, mortgage rates will rise, depressing the upturn which should occur in housing and consumer spending on furniture and appliances this spring.
<P>

<B>The February Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus continues to show a remarkable unanimity of views among private sector forecasters.</B> The average forecast for output growth in 1996 is 2.0% with the ten most optimistic analysts projecting a gain of 2.5% and the ten most pessimistic expecting a gain of 1.4%. In January, by contrast, the average forecast for 1996 projected 2.2% output growth. Analysts have lowered their 1996 forecasts because of downward revisions in growth estimates of the fourth quarter of 1995 as well as the first quarter of this year. In 1997, the consensus projects that output growth will accelerate to 2.1%. The ten most optimistic analysts are projecting 2.6% output growth compared to 1.6% for the ten most pessimistic.
<P>

The primary factor holding most private sector growth forecasts close to 2.0% is the perception of analysts that the economy has achieved full employment and thus can sustain output growth only slightly above 2.0% if inflation is going to remain below 3.0%. If analyst perceived that the economy had more supply potential, they would probably boost their growth forecasts but since the latest GDP revisions lowered estimates of the U.S. economy's recent growth performance <B>most forecasters are even more cautious about the economy's growth potential today than they were six months ago.</B>
