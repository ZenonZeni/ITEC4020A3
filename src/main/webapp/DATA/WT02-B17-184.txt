<h2>FEMP Reaches Out to Establish Partner Resource Center</h2>

By reaching out into the energy management community, FEMP has
found a new way to carry out its mission and meet its goals through
cooperative partnerships.  Expanding its network of partners to
promote energy efficiency, water conservation, and renewable energy
resources in Federal facilities, FEMP has established FEMP Partner
Resource Centers.  Located at various sites throughout the country,
these Resource Centers provide convenient, localized access for
Federal energy managers to take advantage of FEMP software, information,
publications, and training opportunities.  Equally as important
however, these Centers provide valuable points of contact for
Federal energy managers since they are hosted by personnel who
are knowledgeable of the issues facing today's energy manager
and eager to work more closely with their Federal customers in
an increasingly challenging environment.
<P>
To date, five FEMP partners located across the U.S. have established
Resource Centers. They are Consolidated Edison, Southern California
Edison, Texas Utilities, Bonneville Power Administration, and
the Seattle Lighting Design Laboratory.  The map shows the location
of these FEMP partners who are already operating their Resource
Centers&#151;all of which have dedicated facilities, computers,
communications capabilities, and personnel to provide useful information
and technical assistance to their Federal customers.  In addition,
ten partners have agreed to establish Centers and are currently
making arrangements to set them up.   These Resource Center hosts
are knowledgeable of the Federal facilities located within their
region and are capable of assisting Federal customers in taking
advantage of appropriate energy efficiency and utility programs,
rate offerings, and services.  They are also knowledgeable about
legislative and other requirements affecting Federal customers
and are aware of other agency-sponsored programs and resources
in addition to FEMP's.  Since there are no restrictions on
the types of organizations that can participate, future Resource
Center partners may include State energy offices, energy service
companies, and other Federal agencies.  By leveraging the partners'
resources to help make FEMP's own resources more accessible,
FEMP's ability to assist Federal agencies achieve their mandated
energy efficiency and water conservation goals is greatly enhanced.
 In addition, training courses in facility energy management developed
by FEMP have found enthusiastic new audiences when conducted at
Resource Centers using their staff support.
<P>
FEMP is continuing to identify qualified partners willing to establish
new Resource Centers.  However, these facilities need to be visited
by Federal energy managers if they are to provide their valuable
services as intended.  Federal energy managers and their staff
are strongly encouraged to take advantage of this valuable opportunity
made possible by FEMP and its partners by stopping in to visit
one of these centers.  All it takes is a phone call to the nearest
Center to test the most recent versions of FEMP software tools,
obtain training information, identify cost-saving arrangements,
and pick up technical information that provides the latest ideas
for using energy and water more efficiently.
<P>
<I>For additional information or if your organization is interested
in establishing its own Resource Center, contact Lou Harris of
FEMP at (202) 586-9794 to obtain a Resource Center information
package.  In addition, FEMP Regional Enregy Action Project Teams
have similar capabilities to serve you (see <a href="oct96_contacts.html">contacts</a>).</I>
