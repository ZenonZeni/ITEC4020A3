Quote: "When you can measure what you are speaking about, and 
express it in numbers, you know something about it; but 
when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of 
a meager and unsatisfactory kind. It may be the beginning of 
knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced 
to the stage of science."

<A HREF="http://www.amsinc.com"> AMS' home page </A> (mostly corporate PR).
Other AMS homepages are listed on my <a href="./hotlist.html">hotlist.</a>
<p>
Pat received a BS degree with in mathematics from Virginia Tech, 
Blacksburg, VA, in 1974, a MS degree in computer science from GMU
in 1993.
<p>
Pat's <A HREF="./vita.ps">curriculum vita</A> is available
(in postscript), but it is pretty small, his academic career is just starting.
His <A HREF="./resume.ps">professional resume</A> is reasonably current,
but it is very long. He has been a consultant too long. Pat's 
<a href="./geek/geek.html">geek code</a> 
is available, but it only approximates part of his technical flavor.
