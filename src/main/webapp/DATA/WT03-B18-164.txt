<b><CENTER>MANAGEMENT GROUPS</B></CENTER>
<P>Dr Hermann Sch&auml;fer (Mobil) retired at the end of last year and his
position as Chairman of the Oil Pipelines Management Group has been taken
over by Mr Cam Macara (Shell). The other Management Group Chairmen are unchanged
(see CONCAWE Review, Volume 3, Number 1, April 1994). <BR>

<center><B>SECRETARIAT</B></CENTER>

<P>After a long period of stability, a number of changes of personnel are
taking place in the Secretariat.<BR>
<BR>
Denis Lyons, who has been with the Secretariat for 10 years, has recently
taken early retirement. Over these years, Denis has been responsible for
both the Refining Planning function and for overseeing CONCAWE publications.
In this latter role he has had the job of principal editor for the CONCAWE
Review, successfully published since early 1992. Mr Kees van Leeuwen (Shell)
is taking over as Technical Coordinator, Publications and Refining Planning.<BR>
<BR>
Roger Hutcheson will also be taking early retirement after more than six
years as Technical Coordinator for Automotive Emissions activities. In this
role, he has overseen a large proportion of CONCAWE's research budget and
been instrumental in producing many authoritative reports on the subject
including CONCAWE's well-received encyclopedia on auto fuels and vehicle
emissions regulations. Roger will hand over to Dr Peter Heinze (Mobil) at
the end of September.<BR>
<BR>
Les White has been with CONCAWE for six years as the Technical Coordinator
for Air Quality matters. He will shortly be returning to a post in Esso.
Over the last couple of years, Les has been the kingpin of CONCAWE's contribution
to the Auto Oil Programme in which he has worked closely with our sister
organization, EUROPIA. His replacement is Dr Suzie Baverstock (BP).<BR>
<BR>
The three colleagues will be sorely missed by the other members of the Secretariat
but we have been fortunate to have found excellent replacements. We wish
all of them well in their future endeavours.<BR>
<BR>
The new Secretariat following these changes is shown in the Table below.<BR>
