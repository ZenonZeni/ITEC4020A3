<h3>9. Correspondence with the Poet-Physician Walter Vogt </h3>
</center>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My friendship with the physician, psychiatrist, and
writer Walter Vogt, M.D., is also among the personal contacts
that I owe to LSD. As the following extract from our
correspondence shows, it was less the medicinal aspects of LSD,
important to the physician, than the consciousness-altering
effects on the depth of the psyche, of interest to the writer,
that constituted the theme of our correspondence. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Muri/Bern, 22 November 1970 <br>
    Dear Mr. Hofmann, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Last night I dreamed that I was invited to tea
    in a cafe by a friendly family in Rome. This family also knew
    the pope, and so the pope sat at&#151;the same table to tea
    with us. He was all in white and also wore a white miter. He
    sat there so handsome and was silent. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; And today I suddenly had the idea of sending
    you my <i>Vogel auf dem Tisch </i>[Bird on the table&#151;as
    a visiting card if you so wish&#151;a book that remained a
    little apocryphal, which upon reflection I do not regret,
    although the Italian translator is firmly convinced that is
    my best. (Ah yes, the pope is also an Italian. So it goes.
    &#133;) <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Possibly this little work will interest you. It
    was written in 1966 by an author who at that time still had
    not had any shred of experience with psychedelic substances
    and who read the reports about medicinal experiments with
    these drugs devoid of understanding. However, little has
    changed since, except that now the misgiving comes from the
    other side. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I suppose that your discovery has caused a
    hiatus (not directly a Saul-to-Paul conversion as Roland
    Fischer says&#133;) in my work (also a large word) - and
    indeed, that which I have written since has become rather
    realistic or at least less expressive. In any case I could
    not have brought off the cool realism of my TV piece
    &quot;Spiele der Macht&quot; [Games of power] without it. The
    different drafts attest it, in case they are still lying
    around somewhere. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Should you have interest and time for a
    meeting, it would delight me very much to visit you sometime
    for a conversation. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; W. V. </p>

    November 1970 <br>
    Dear Mr. Vogt, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; If the bird that alighted on my table was able
    to find its way to me, this is one more debt I owe to the
    magical effect of LSD. I could soon write a book about all of
    the results that derive from that experiment in 1943.... <br>

    Muri/Bern, 13 March 1971 <br>
    Dear Mr. Hofmann, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Enclosed is a critique of Jünger's <i>Annahenngen</i>
    [Approaches], from the daily paper, that will presumably
    interest you.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It seems to me that to hallucinate&#151;to
    dream&#151;to write, stands at all times in contrast to
    everyday consciousness, and their functions are
    complementary. Here I can naturally speak only for myself.
    This could be different with others&#151;it is also truly
    difficult to speak with others about such things, because
    people often speak altogether different languages.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; However, since you are now gathering
    autographs, and do me the honor of incorporating some of my
    letters in your collection, I enclose for you the manuscript
    of my &quot;testament&quot;&#151;in which your discovery
    plays a role as &quot;the only joyous invention of the
    twentieth century....&quot; <br>

    Dear Mr. Vogt, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; You have again presented me with a lovely
    letter and a very valuable autograph, the testament 1969.... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Very remarkable dreams in recent times induce
    me to test a connection between the composition (chemical) of
    the evening meal and the quality of dreams. Yes, LSD is also
    something that one eats.... <br>

    Muri/Bern, 5 September 1971 <br>
    Dear Mr. Hofmann, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the weekend at Murtensee [On that Sunday,
    I (A. H.) hovered over the Murtensee in the balloon of my
    friend E. I., who had taken me along as passenger.] I often
    thought of you&#151;a most radiant autumn day. Yesterday,
    Saturday, thanks to one tablet of aspirin (on account of a
    headache or mild flu), I experienced a very comical
    flashback, like with mescaline (of which I have had only a
    little, exactly once).... <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I have read a delightful essay by Wasson about
    mushrooms; he divides mankind into mycophobes and
    mycophiles.... Lovely fly agarics must now be growing in the
    forest near you. Sometime shouldn't we sample some? <br>

    Dear Mr. Hofmann, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I feel I must write briefly to tell you
    what I have done outside in the sun, on the dock under your
    balloon: I finally wrote some notes about our visit in
    Villars-sur-Ollons (with Dr. Leary), then a hippie-bark went
    by on the lake, self-made like from a Fellini film, which I
    sketched, and over and above it I drew your balloon. <br>

    Dear Mr. Vogt, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Your television play &quot;Spiele der
    Macht&quot; [Games of power] has impressed me
    extraordinarily. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I congratulate you on this magnificent piece,
    which allows mental cruelty to become conscious, and
    therefore also acts in its way as &quot;consciousness-
    expanding&quot;, and can thereby prove itself therapeutic in
    a higher sense, like ancient tragedy. <br>

<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Burg i.L., 19 May 1973 <br>
    Dear Mr. Vogt, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Now I have already read your lay sermon three
    times, the description and interpretation of your Sinai Trip.
    [Walter Vogt: <i>Mein Sinai Trip. Eine Laienpredigt</i> [My
    Sinai trip: A lay sermon] (Verlag der Arche, Zurich, 1972).
    This publication contains the text of a lay sermon that
    Walter Vogt gave on 14 November 1971 on the invitation of
    Parson Christoph Mohl, in the Protestant church of Vaduz
    (Lichtenstein), in the course of a series of sermons by
    writers, and in addition contains an afterword by the author
    and by the inviting parson. It involves the description and
    interpretation of an ecstatic-religious experience evoked by
    LSD, that the author is able to &quot;place in a distant, if
    you will superficial, analogy to the great Sinai Trip of
    Moses.&quot; It is not only the &quot;patriarchal
    atmosphere&quot; that is to be traced out of these
    descriptions, that constitutes this analogy; there are deeper
    references, which are more to be read between the lines of
    this text.] Was it really an LSD trip?&#133; It was a
    courageous deed, to choose such a notorious event as a drug
    experience as the theme of a sermon, even a lay sermon. But
    the questions raised by hallucinogenic drugs do actually
    belong in the church&#151;in a prominent place in the church,
    for they are sacred drugs (peyotl, teonanacatl, ololiuhqui,
    with which LSD is mostly closely related by chemical
    structure and activity). <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I can fully agree with what you say in your
    introduction about the modern ecclesiastical religiosity: the
    three sanctioned states of consciousness (the waking
    condition of uninterrupted work and performance of duty,
    alcoholic intoxication, and sleep), the distinction between
    two phases of psychedelic inebriation (the first phase, the
    peak of the trip, in which the cosmic relationship is
    experienced, or the submersion into one's own body, in which
    everything that is, is within; and the second phase,
    characterized as the phase of enhanced comprehension of
    symbols), and the allusion to the candor that hallucinogens
    bring about in consciousness states. These are all
    observations that are of fundamental importance in the
    judgment of hallucinogenic inebriation. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The most worthwhile spiritual benefit from LSD
    experiments was the experience of the inextricable
    intertwining of the physical and spiritual. &quot;Christ in
    matter&quot; (Teilhard de Chardin). Did the insight first
    come to you also through your drug experiences, that we must
    descend &quot;into the flesh, which we are,&quot; in order to
    get new prophesies? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; A criticism of your sermon: you allow the
    &quot;deepest experience that there is&quot;&#151;&quot;The
    kingdom of heaven is within you&quot;&#151;to be uttered by
    Timothy Leary. This sentence, quoted without the indication
    of its true source, could be interpreted as ignorance of one,
    or rather <i>the</i> principal truth of Christian belief. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; One of your statements deserves universal
    recognition: &quot;There is no non-ecstatic religious
    experience.&quot;&#133; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Next Monday evening I shall be interviewed on
    Swiss television (about LSD and the Mexican magic drugs, on
    the program &quot;At First Hand&quot;). I am curious about
    the sort of questions that will be asked&#133; <br>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Muri/Bern, 24 May 1973 <br>
    Dear Mr. Hofmann, <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course it was LSD&#151;only I did not want
    to write about it explicitly, I really do not know just why
    myself.... The great emphasis I placed on the good Leary, who
    now seems to me to be somewhat flipped out, as the prime
    witness, can indeed only be explained by the special context
    of the talk or sermon. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; I must admit that the perception that we must
    descend &quot;into the flesh, which we are&quot; actually
    first came to me with LSD. I still ruminate on it, possibly
    it even came &quot;too late&quot; for me in fact, although
    more and more I advocate your opinion that LSD should be
    taboo for youth (taboo, not forbidden, that is the
    difference&#133;). <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The sentence that you like, &quot;there is no
    nonecstatic religious experience,&quot; was apparently not
    liked so much by others&#151;for example, by my (almost only)
    literary friend and minister-lyric poet Kurt Marti.&#133; But
    in any case, we are practically never of the same opinion
    about anything, and notwithstanding, we constitute when we
    occasionally communicate by phone and arrange little
    activities together, the smallest minimafia of Switzerland. <br>
