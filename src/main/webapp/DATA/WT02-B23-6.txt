 <H1><P ALIGN=CENTER>The REAL Conservative Conspiracy</H1>


<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>aka "How to succeed in politics without really trying."</H2>

<H4>

<DD>Money makes the world go round.
<P>
This much might appear to be true; money is the great motivator, the great
communicator; that which separates the players from the pawns; the "winners"
from the "losers", etc.
<P>
Is the "Republican Revolution" about anything more than money?  I think not.
<P>
The American people are once-again being hoodwinked into beliving the party
line - not that any single party really has the right idea, but trust me
folks, it sure as hell isn't the conservatives/republicans!
<P>
While they love to bask in their own, completely ridiculous conspiracy
theories, such as this convoluted Whitewater/Vince Foster deal - a 
Washington "Witch Hunt" expressely designed to create bad PR for Clinton
at key moments in the campaign, they laud the "integrity" of Reagan, a
president who single-handedly pissed off most of the civiliized world
by invading Panama, and lied under oath in Congress along with most of
his administration, and set a new standard for using ignorance as a 
method of absolving oneself from the responsibility of office.  Only
the Republicans, with their multi-faceted PR machine headed by groups
such as the Christian Coalition and the NRA, could turn a two-faced,
defense-contractor-subsidized burned out hollywood star, into some sort
of political folk legend.  The worst part is that the American people
seem to buy this crap.  And what's behind it?  Money & power - the two of
which are synonymous in today's political arena.
<P>
<center><H2>The Environmental Issue</H2></center>
<P>
This is a good issue to use to exemplify the conservative conspiracy
theory.  They can't talk specifically about issues, instead, they have
a knack for lumping every opponent into some neat category in order to
be discounted; a popular one seems to be the "environmental wacko" group.
<P>
The conservatives want to abolish the EPA.  They claim environmental 
regulations stifle business.  Ok, sure that's true - if you want to build
an industrial waste processing facility in the middle of a residential
neighborhood, chances are there ARE government regulations standing in
your way.  If you want to harvest as much fish as you possibly can, 
regardless of whether it irreversibly depletes the stock; if you want
to dump some new pesticide on your crops that half the rest of the
world has banned, Uncle Sam has
rules to control this.  Is this so bad?  <I>The GOP loves to talk about giving
the states more power.</I>  This is all part of the conspiracy - it's much
easier to politically maneuver regionally than nationally - it's a lot
cheaper for the big corporations to buy local politicians than national
ones - who are generally more concerned about their image.  Our leaders
aren't doing the American people any favors by supposedly "reducing 
Washington beuracracy" - they're not reducing any red tape - they're 
transferring it from one group to another - and the latter group is
more-easily manipulated by business interests.  This also makes if easier
for them to cut funding - if they give block grants for ambiguous state-related
projects, they can cut the money in half, and it doesn't look like they're
taking food out of childrens' mouths - no, they're not doing that - it's the
state's PR problem now.
<P>
In order to substaniate my idea that there actually is some sort of
"conspiracy", we link two distinct politically-correct republican movements.
First I want to point out that in general, I don't necessarily believe 
that any political party really has some "master plan", but when you 
look at the relationship between some of these things, it starts to seem
a bit scary - take a look at the proposed legislation to put a cap on
damages for civil lawsuits...
<P>
The party line on this has to do with "Lawsuit abuse" - oh yes, let's run
a story about some lady who got some hot coffee from McDonalds and sued
for a few million dollars - yes that disgusts us - but let's admit the
truth - it only disgusts us because we wish it happened to US - we're
jealous that this woman could get some "easy money" and we have to work
our butts off.
<P>
Every day, there seems to be another carefully-planted story on some kook
who tries to sue the state, government or mega-corporation over a rather
trivial issue.  No amount of legislation is ever going to curb this trend - there
will always be people who will try to get some easy money from those that
have big bucks.  
<P>
These 'outrageous lawsuits' are probably the last bastion or justice that John Q. Public
has in the wake of corporate tomfoolery with the environment and the 
quality of their products.  We've already hears stories about major 
manufacturers, such as GM, who have defects in their products and have
determined that it's actually CHEAPER to settle the lawsuits brought
against them in these cases, rather than issue a recall and correct their
mistakes.  What happens if there is an even tighter limit on the maximum
amount of damages they may be liable for?  You guessed it.  We're screwed.
<P>
What happens when some oil company spills millions of gallons of oil into
the sea?  If they could get out of cleaning up this mess, and instead
settle a class-action suit for a significantly less amount of money,
what do you think they're going to do?  These corporations have more
loyalty to their shareholders than they do the environment.  And if the
republicans have their way, there won't be an EPA with any ability to
force them to correct their mistakes.  This isn't some hypothetical situation.
It's being carefully planned right now - the various elements to make this
work are being pushed through Congress in bite-sized pieces in order to 
seem like separate issues, but make no mistake, when you look at the big
picture, all this legislation has one dramatic effect: It reduces the 
ability of the American people (directly and indirectly) to control the destructive activities of
big business.
<P>
Let's take another issue into this scenario.  The current class-action
lawsuit against the tobacco companies - consider that companies such as
RJR are major players in pushing for this legislation to cap damages on
civil lawsuits - they probably know in the long run they can't hide the
fact that they knew about the addictive effects of nicotine and they indeed
did control its levels.  It's just a matter of time before they lose, but
you can bet they'll use their influence to reduce the amount of financial
liability they could be exposed to.  It's also interesting to note that
at the same time some groups are claiming that nicotine should be controlled
by the FDA, many republicans are also talking about abolishing the FDA as
well.  Perhaps by the time the courts publicly acknowledge that cigarettes
should be mandated under FDA control, the FDA will be abolished as well
and it won't matter?  It's not that outrageous of an idea - all of this
plays extremely well into the conservative party line having to do with
a bloated government.  Unfortunately, agencies like the FCC, FDA, EPA are
not the kinds of areas of government that should be reduced - there is no
acceptable regional alternative in these cases.
<P>
It's something to think about... <P>
