ASSESSMENT OF THE LOSS AND DEGRADATION OF ECOSYSTEMS IN
THE U.S.

This (National Biological Service) report: presents
estimates of declines of natural ecosystems in the
U.S.; provides a rationale for ecosystem-level
conservation; discusses decline and threat as criteria
for conservation; and relates ecosystem losses to
endangerment at species and population levels.  It
suggests that integrated conservation plans be
developed for all ecosystems in each ecoregion of the
U.S., starting with types and regions that sustained
the greatest losses and are at greatest risk of further
loss.

ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION IN THE U.S.

At its core, environmental restoration -- defined as
the cleanup of contaminants from past activities --
depends on a series of decisions about the nature and
extent of contamination, the risk to human health and
the environment, and the potential effectiveness of
remediation techniques and technologies to reduce the
risk to acceptable levels.  The effectiveness with
which these decisions are made has significant impact
on the cost and duration of the cleanup efforts.  The
decisions must often be made on the basis of incomplete
and uncertain data.  Emerging environmental information
and data acquisition technologies, together with
appropriate strategies to support decision-making, are
beginning to change the way environmental restoration
occurs in the U.S.

Past environmental restoration activities too often
relied on prescriptive data collection activities to
generate the information upon which decisions were
made.  Retrospective studies of such activities show
that often data were gathered for the purpose of
reducing the risk in decision-making, but little true
reduction in risk was realized and large amounts of
resources were consumed.  Recent examination of the
failures in the U.S. to achieve many complete cleanups,
despite the investment of large sums and time, points
to the inability to have decisions made efficiently.

The solution to the problem involves both regulatory
change to allow more flexibility in decision-making and
the introduction of technology to improve
decision-making.  This (Argonne National Laboratory)
paper reviews recent assessments made of cleanup
processes and the application of strategies and
technologies to enhance decision-making for cleanup.
It provides examples of the decision-making approaches
and the technologies that have been employed to speed
up characterization and to optimize the implementation
of remediation.

PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

From the ozone hole and the greenhouse effect, to
plastics recycling and hazardous waste disposal,
society faces a number of issues requiring an
unprecedented understanding of the properties of
molecules.  We are coming to realize that the
environment is a coupled set of chemical systems.  Its
dynamics determine the welfare of the biosphere and of
humans in particular.  These chemical systems are
governed by fundamental molecular interactions, and
they present chemists with an unparalleled challenge.
The application of current concepts of molecular
behavior and of up-to-date experimental and
computational techniques can provide us with
environmental insights needed to: mitigate past damage;
anticipate the impact of current human activity; and
avoid future insults to the environment.

Environmental chemistry encompasses a number of
separate, yet interlocking, areas of research.  In all
of these areas, progress is limited by an inadequate
understanding of the underlying chemical processes
involved.  Participation of all chemical approaches
(experimental, theoretical, and computational) and of
all disciplines of chemistry (organic, inorganic,
physical, analytical, and biochemistry) will be
required to provide the necessary fundamental
understanding.  This (Battelle Pacific Northwest
Laboratories) paper discusses physical chemistry and
the environment.

SITE REMEDIATION CASE STUDIES

This (Federal Remediation Technologies Roundtable)
report is a collection of abstracts summarizing 37 case
studies of site remediation projects prepared by
federal agencies.  The case studies were undertaken to
document the results and lessons learned from early
technology applications.  They help to establish
benchmark data on cost and performance, which should
lead to greater confidence in the selection and use of
cleanup technologies.

JUDGING THE HEALTH RISKS OF ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES

This (Brookhaven National Laboratory) report provides
perspective on the various risks to which man is
routinely exposed.  It serves as a basis for
understanding the meaning of quantitative risk
estimates and for comparing new or newly-discovered
risks with other better-understood risks.  Specific
emphasis is placed on the health risks of energy
technologies.  The report is not a risk assessment, nor
does it contain instructions on how to do a risk
assessment; rather, it provides background information
on how most of us think about risks and why it is
difficult to do it rationally.  It provides a
philosophy and data to use to do a better job of
judging risks more rationally.  It also provides an
overview of where the risks of energy technologies fit
within the spectrum of all risks.  Much of the
quantitative information provided is on the relative
risk of dying of various causes.  This is not because
the risk of dying is seen as the most important kind of
risk, but because the statistics on mortality rates by
cause are the highest-quality data available on health
risks in the general population.  (Although the report
is dated Sep. 1992, it was revised in May 1994.)

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES USING LIDAR

This translation of a Doctoral thesis from Sweden (Lund
University) concerns the application of lidar
techniques in environmental studies.  Lidar
measurements are performed with a mobile lidar system,
based on a Nd:YAG-pumped dye laser, to measure mercury
fluxes on emissions from chlor-alkali plants in Sweden
and Italy.  An Italian cinnabar mining area (where
mining activities stopped in 1982) is mapped, and high
fluxes of atomic mercury vapor are detected.
Comparative measurements are also made using a
conventional gold-amalgamation-point monitor.

Plumes from geothermal plants in Italy are also
monitored, and it is found that the amount of mercury
emitted is much higher than expected.  Lidar
measurements are also performed on the gas plumes
emerging from the Italian volcanoes Etna, Stromboli,
and Vulcano, using a lidar system on a ship that made
traverses under the plumes.

A vertically-sounding ozone lidar system for
tropospheric measurements has also been constructed,
based on a KrF excimer laser whose output is
Raman-shifted in hydrogen to obtain wavelengths of  277
and 313 nm.  Comparisons with two other ozone
monitoring systems -- a ND:YAG/dye laser based the
lidar system, and a differential absorption optical
system (DOAS) -- are carried out.  The mobile lidar
system is integrated with a spectrally-resolving
optical multi-channel system and a multi-color imaging
system, to remotely detect fluorescence from vegetation
and water.  It is found that the fluorescence spectra
from vegetation exposed to environmental stress are
different from the spectra detected from control
vegetation.  Fluorescence images are recorded from
distances up to 100 m.  The thesis contains
157 references and 15 figures.

CARBON MONOXIDE EXPOSURES INSIDE OF AUTOMOBILES

This (EPA) paper deals with carbon monoxide (CO)
exposures measured inside a motor vehicle during
88 standardized drives on a major urban arterial
highway (El Camino Real) having a traffic volume of
30,500-45,000 vehicles per day, over a 13-1/2 month
period.  For the 88 trips, the mean CO concentration
was 9.8 ppm, with a standard deviation of 5.8 ppm.  A
fairly-strong seasonal trend exists for the co-variates
that were examined: ambient CO at 2 fixed stations;
atmospheric stability; seasonal trend function; time of
day; average surrounding vehicle count; trip duration;
proportion of time stopped at lights; and instrument
type.  A model consisting of only a single measure of
traffic volume and a seasonal trend component, has
substantial predictive power; by contrast, the ambient
CO levels, although partially correlated with average
exposures, contributed comparatively little predictive
power to the model.  The study shows that: (1) the mass
balance equation can relate exterior CO concentrations
as a function of time, to interior CO concentrations;
(2) CO exposures on urban arterial highways vary with
season; (3) momentary CO experienced behind red lights
vary with the intersection; and (4) an averaging-time
model can simulate exposures during short trips
(20 minutes or less) on urban arterial highways.

SURVEY OF WORKER HEALTH SYMPTOMS AND INDOOR AIR IN
OFFICE BUILDINGS

This (EPA) paper reports the results of a questionnaire
on health symptoms, workplace conditions, and perceived
indoor air quality that was administered to a total of
3948 employees of the EPA working in 3 office buildings
in Washington, DC, to determine the personal or
workplace characteristics associated with health
symptoms.  A principal-components analysis of 32 health
symptoms identified 12 health factors, each generally
associated with a particular body system (eyes, nose,
throat, chest, central nervous system, etc.).  The  12
health factors have been regressed linearly on  50-100
personal, workplace, and spatial characteristics
identified from the questionnaire and building
blueprints.  Significant variables (p <0.01) are
included in a second logistic regression to determine a
final model.

USING GAS REBURNING TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE ATMOSPHERIC
NOx EMISSIONS FROM FURNACES AND KILNS

This (Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc.) report
analyzes a number of industrial processes and assesses
the suitability of using natural gas reburning
technology to achieve reduced NOx emissions.  In gas
reburning, a small amount of gas -- typically 10-15% of
the total fuel input -- is injected above the primary
fuel zone to create a fuel-rich reburn zone where NOx
is reduced.  Gas reburning has the capability to reduce
NOx emissions by 50-65%, but its use in particular
applications is dependent on specific process and
combustion parameters.  The report identifies five
industrial processes as being suitable for natural gas
reburning: glass melting furnaces; cement kilns; reheat
furnaces; process heaters; and waste-heat recovery
systems.

GAS REBURN TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE NOx EMISSIONS IN
TANGENTIALLY-FIRED BOILERS [951321]

There are several ways that owners of
tangentially-fired boilers can reduce nitrogen oxides
(NOx) emissions, in order to comply with the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990.  This (ABB Combustion
Engineering Services Inc.) report presents and
discusses the development of a close-coupled gas reburn
technology for this purpose.  Close-coupled gas reburn
technology has the potential to be a relatively
lower-cost derivative of standard reburning technology.
A utility scale feasibility, test, and evaluation
program is reported that examines the technology's NOx
reduction capability and its boiler-performance
impacts.

PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN FOODS: A DATABASE FOR COMPUTERS

This (FDA) database, consisting of three 3-1/2 inch DOS
diskettes, provides comprehensive information on the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration's monitoring,
coverage, and findings of pesticide residues in foods
under the regulatory monitoring (i.e., tolerance
enforcement) component of the FDA pesticide program for
FY 1993.  It covers domestically produced and imported
foods representing about 100 countries.  The database
contains three sections.  The first section is a large
detailed data file that presents FDA pesticide
monitoring coverage and findings by country/food
product/pesticide combination.  The other two sections
are smaller summary files that provide an overview by
country/pesticide combination without regard to
pesticide, and by country/pesticide combination without
regard to product.  They are accompanied by a search
program and report formats that enable users to perform
simple searches and generate reports.  The raw data by
individual sample, from which the three files are
compiled, are also provided.  The diskettes contain
text only; users must provide their own search and
retrieval software.  They are formatted in Dbase III
Plus.  Memory requirement is 640 K, and an IBM
compatible 486 computer is recommended for practical
processing speed.  The files are compressed, 1.44 M
high-density.

REMOVING PCBs FROM CONTAMINATED SOIL USING THE CF
SYSTEM(tm) SOLVENT EXTRACTION PROCESS

This (Science Applications International Corp.) report
covers a treatability study of the removal of PCBs from
contaminated soil using the CF System(tm) Solvent
Extraction Process.  Soil samples were obtained from
the Springfield Township Superfund Site, Davisburg
Michigan, taken from a specific area of that site
known to have some of the highest concentrations of
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).  The samples were
shipped to Hazen Research Corporation, Golden,
Colorado, where CF-System's Solvent Extraction pilot
plant is located.  The results show that the process is
effective in reducing the concentration of PCBs in site
soils.  Removal efficiencies range from a low of 91.4%
when two extraction cycles are used, to 99.4% when five
extraction cycles are used.

SOLVENT EXTRACTION FOR SEPARATING HAZARDOUS WASTE-SITE
CONTAMINANTS

This (Science Applications International) bulletin
deals with solvent extraction, which does not destroy
hazardous contaminants, but is a means of separating
those contaminants from soils, sludges, and sediments,
thereby reducing the volume of the hazardous material
that must be treated.  Generally, it is used as part of
a series of unit operations, and it can reduce the
overall cost for managing a particular site.  The
bulletin provides information on: the applicability of
the technology; the types of residuals produced; the
latest performance data; site requirements; the status
of the technology; and sources for further information.

CONTAMINATED SOIL RESTORATION USING VAPOR EXTRACTION

This Master's thesis (from the University of Texas)
presents a review of vapor extraction technology for
remediation of contaminated soils.  Effective
remediation of sites contaminated with VOCs (volatile
organic compounds) requires a sound understanding of
regulatory issues, technology options, and the site
hydrogeology.  A technology that is increasingly being
used for the remediation of VOC-contaminated sites is
soil vapor extraction.  Soil vapor extraction, also
known as soil venting and soil air stripping, allows
remediation of VOC contamination without the need for
excavation.  In soil vapor extraction, a vacuum pump or
blower moves air through the soil near the contaminated
zone.  As contaminated air is removed, cleaner air
moves through the soil to replace it.  This air
movement can also promote microbial degradation of
contaminants at many sites.

IN SITU RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) HEATING TO ENHANCE VAPOR
EXTRACTION OF CONTAMINANTS FROM SOIL

This (Westinghouse Savannah River Co.) report presents
and discusses a field demonstration program involving
in situ radio frequency heating to investigate its
effectiveness as an enhancement to vacuum extraction of
residual solvents (primarily trichloroethylene and
perchloroethylene) held in vadose zone clay deposits.
Conventional soil vacuum extraction techniques are
mass-transfer limited because of the low permeabilities
of the clays.  By selectively heating the clays to
temperatures at or above 100 C, the release or
transport of the solvent vapors are enhanced as a
result of several factors, including: an increase in
the contaminant vapor pressure; an increase in
diffusivity; and an increase in the effective
permeability of the formation caused by the release of
water vapor.

OXYGEN-ENRICHED CO-INCINERATION OF MUNICIPAL SOLID
WASTE (MSW) AND SEWAGE SLUDGE

This (NREL) report deals with co-incineration of MSW
and sewage sludge.  Federal regulations banning ocean
dumping of sewage sludge, coupled with stricter
regulations on the disposal of sewage sludge in
landfills, have forced municipalities (especially those
in the northeast U.S.) to consider alternate methods
for disposal of this solid waste.  Co-incineration of
MSW and sludge has proven to be economically attractive
in both Europe and Japan, but has not yet proven to be
a viable sludge disposal technology in the U.S.,
because of a history of operational problems in
existing facilities.  The most prevalent problem in co-
incinerating MSW and a dewatered sewage sludge (15% to
25% solids) is incomplete sludge combustion.
Incomplete combustion is primarily a function of sludge
particle problems that occur when the surface of the
sludge particle dries and hardens while the inner mass
is unaffected.  This phenomenon is commonly referred to
in the industry as the "hamburger effect."

This report details a new process being developed for
the disposal of a dewatered sewage sludge.  It provides
a comprehensive summary of the pilot demonstration test
program for oxygen-enriched co-incineration of MSW and
sewage sludge, including description of: the pilot test
facility; the instrumentation; the methods of data
collection; data analyses; how the tests were executed;
and the test results.  The report also provides
recommendations for the future development of this
technology in the current marketplace.

CANDIDATE PROCESSES FOR IN SITU TREATMENT OF MIXED VOC
AND RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINANTS IN GROUNDWATER

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report describes
the screening and preliminary evaluation of candidate
treatment for use in treating mixed contaminant
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and radionuclides in
groundwater.  Treating mixed contaminants presents
unusual difficulties.  Typically, VOCs are the most
abundant contaminants, but the presence of
radionuclides results in additional health concerns
that must be addressed, usually by a treatment approach
different from that used for VOCs.  Furthermore, the
presence of radionuclides may yield mixed solid wastes
if the VOCs are treated by conventional means.

These issues are specifically addressed in the
evaluation of candidate treatment processes for testing
in this program.  Moreover, because no research or
early development of a particular process would be
performed, the technology review also focuses on
technologies that could be readily adapted and
integrated for use with mixed contaminants.  The
objective is to couple emerging or available processes
into treatment modules for use in situ.  The findings
reported in this document encompass all activities
through the treatment process evaluations.

MODULAR RISK ANALYSIS FOR ASSESSING SITES CONTAINING
MULTIPLE MIXED RADIOACTIVE WASTES

This (Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) report
concerns modular risk analysis for assessing mixed
waste sites.  Human-health impacts, especially to the
surrounding public, are extremely difficult to assess
at installations that contain multiple waste sites and
a variety of mixed waste constituents (e.g., organic,
inorganic, and radioactive wastes).  These assessments
must address: different constituents; multiple waste
sites; multiple release patterns; different transport
pathways (i.e., groundwater, surface water, air, and
overland soil); different receptor types and locations;
various times of interest; population distributions;
land-use patterns; baseline assessments; a variety of
exposure scenarios; etc.  Utilizing a modular/GIS
(geographical information system)-based approach
overcomes difficulties in (1) analyzing a wide variety
of scenarios for multiple mixed waste sites and (2)
communicating results from a complex human-heath-impact
analysis by capturing the essence of the assessment in
a relatively elegant manner -- so the meaning of the
results can be quickly conveyed to all who review them.

WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH 104,000,000 CUBIC FEET OF LOW
LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE

The Fernald Site, a DOE uranium metal production
facility that ceased production in 1989, is now being
remediated by the DOE under terms of a consent
agreement with the EPA and the State of Ohio.  It is
estimated that the cleanup will generate 104,000,000
cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste, including
construction debris, pit sludge, radium residue, and a
huge volume of uranium-contaminated soil.  The waste
handling strategy for this huge volume of waste
includes minimizing remedial waste generation,
recycling material when economically feasible,
free-releasing clean material, and volume reduction.
It is anticipated that large-scale radium residue
vitrification and sludge drying equipment/facilities
will be constructed onsite for waste treatment prior to
off-site disposal.  Fernald waste disposition will
include both onsite disposal (if approved under CERCLA)
and off-site disposal at both commercial and DOE waste
disposal facilities.  The waste disposition strategy
selected reflects a diverse variety of technical,
political, regulatory, and economic factors.  This
(Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Corp.)
paper describes the current views at Fernald on what
can be done with 104,000,000 cubic feet of Fernald
waste.

THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF NUCLEAR SHIPS

This translation from Denmark (Technical University of
Denmark) represents an evaluation of the potential
risks of nuclear ships.  Reasons are given why nuclear
ship accidents will not lead to accidents of the
magnitude of the Chernobyl accident.  This is due to
the much lower content of radioactive material and to
different reactor designs.  A review is given of the
types of nuclear ship accidents that have actually
occurred, with extra consideration given to reactivity
accidents and loss of coolant accidents that could lead
to serious radiation consequences for the crew and the
environment.  The report also discusses the long-term
risks of sunken nuclear ships and sea-disposed reactor
compartments.  Based on available accident data, an
attempt is made to estimate the probability of future
serious nuclear ship accidents.
