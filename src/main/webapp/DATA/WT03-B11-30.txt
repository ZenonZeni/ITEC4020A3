DEAR SUBSCRIBER,

Don't be surprised if you walk into your phone closet and find it
empty. That big, bulky PBX may soon be replaced by a tiny PC
card.

A PC card now sold by NetPhone, Northboro, Mass., performs all
the standard functions of a PBX, including basic call switching,
executing hunt groups, call forwarding and conferencing, for
example.

The best thing about the NetPhone, however, is its price. The
card and its accompanying software only cost $4,295. That price
easily beats spending several hundred thousand dollars for a PBX,
says Dave Zweiban, telecom consultant at the International Group,
Los Angeles, Calif.

Here's how the NetPhone works: The Windows-based system operates
on a 486 PC that uses Novell Netware and acts as a server on a
LAN, says NetPhone spokesman Bob Fletcher. The card plugs into
the 16-bit ISA slot of the PC, and is connected to phone lines on
a punchdown block.

One card can only handle six trunks and 18 extensions, but six
cards can be installed on a single 486 PC, says Fletcher. Your
full capacity is 36 incoming trunks and 108 extensions -- enough
for a mid-sized site.

NetPhone also includes features that aren't standard on PBXs. A
voice mail system, an automatic attendant and a CTI program that
links Caller ID numbers to customer records are included in
NetPhone's software. And each PC on your LAN is loaded with
software that receives Caller ID from the PBX server and links it
to files, Fletcher says.

But is the PC card too good to be true? Many of the long-standing
PBX manufacturers think so. The majority of PC-card PBXs can't
handle digital lines, T1s or ISDN yet, says Tony Tissot, a
director of marketing at Rolm, San Jose, Calif. And, there is
little redundancy built into the cards, adds Tissot. In most
stand-alone PBXs, you can order back-up circuits for
mission-critical applications, he says.

Tissot is right on many counts. The NetPhone system, for example,
can only handle analog trunks and phones for now, and doesn't
support T1s, ISDN or frame relay. Plus, NetPhone doesn't have a
UPS (uninterruptable power supply) built into it. But, the
company does suggest putting at least a 30-minute UPS on your
server.

When power goes out completely, each card has an automatic "ring
down" feature, says Fletcher. That means each card has one
extension that works off the phone company's power, so you can
dial out, he adds. And, if your server gets locked up or fails,
but its power is still on, the PBX will function normally,
although voice mail and CTI will not run.

NetPhone is now working on T1 and ISDN capabilities for its
cards, and plans to have them ready by the end of '96, says
Fletcher. The company is also developing programming that will
let companies link PBX servers together and control them from a
central PC. That would eliminate one of the other current
advantages of PBXs, says Fletcher.

Ironically, Mitel doesn't think card-based PBXs are a bad idea.
The company is developing a PBX for release in 1996 that combines
PC cards and a LAN server, says Mitel marketing manager Rob
Clark. The cards plug into the back of a PC and will connect to
both digital lines and T1s, he adds. Up to 200 extensions can be
serviced by the PBX.

Manufacturing PC cards that switch calls isn't a big gamble,
Clark explains. "Companies will be pushed into using CTI as it
becomes more and more common in business, and customers will even
start requesting it," he says. "And CTI is very easily integrated
with LANs -- in some cases more so than with PBXs," Clark adds.

Note: if you buy an initial NetPhone card, the card's price is
reduced to $3,295 for additional cards. NetPhone's number is
(508) 393-7979.

MOTOROLA BEATS CELLULAR "PHREAKS"

Worried that hackers may run up big bucks on your company's
cellular phones? Motorola is taking a step that should prevent
hackers from using devices to intercept your phones' electronic
serial numbers and phone numbers.

The company is launching a new line of phones with a microchip
that encrypts each subscriber's phone number and serial number.
Encryption encodes the numbers with algorithms that can only be
decoded by a decryption key at cellular base stations.

Phreaks will still be able to intercept signals, but shouldn't be
able to crack encrypted codes without a decryption key.

USE YOUR ROOFTOP TO MAKE BIG BUCKS

Look up at the stars. Do you see dollar signs in the heavens? You
could if you look a little lower and rent out your rooftop for
wireless antennas.

Rooftop management companies desperately want rooftop space to
meet a rising demand for antenna locations from wireless
carriers. The telecom bill and the '96 auction of PCS licenses
will create an explosion in the number of rooftops needed for
cellular, microwave, PCS and paging antennas over the next three
years, says John Cipollone, vice president of Tower Economics
Company Inc., Bala Cynwyd, Pa. Tower Economics, a rooftop
management company, is now signing deals for rooftop space that
pay owners between $300 and $1,300 per month, adds Cipollone.

The best part of generating revenue with rooftop leases is that
registering with the management companies is free, says Jim
Innes, director of telecom leasing at Apex, Philadelphia, Pa. The
companies put your buildings on their list of eligible sites and
do all of the marketing to wireless carriers, adds Innes. And the
rooftop companies get paid by earning a commission on the monthly
payments a carrier gives you, but only after a deal is signed,
explains Innes. You don't have to do any of the dirty work, like
conducting tests for interference or writing up contracts.

The Teachers College at Columbia University, New York City,
recently got a surprise when it was offered a deal for rooftop
space. The college was considering going with Local Area
Telecommunications (Locate), New York City, for local service
when Locate's technicians noticed one of the college's buildings
was ideal for a microwave antenna, says Tom Fiorella, a business
services analyst at the college.

Locate had rooftop management company AAT Communications Corp.,
Edison, N.J., contact the university and make an offer for space
on the 15-story building, says Fiorella. The offer was $4,800 per
year for 10 square feet of rooftop, he adds.

What type of buildings are needed? Virtually any height is used
by carriers, says Arne Jerfsten, manager of technical support at
Locate. Many small buildings are positioned on hills that provide
good locations for antennas, he adds. Plus, PCS antennas don't
have to be located high above the ground, says Cipollone.

Even if your company is located in a rural area, you should
register with a rooftop management company, says Jim Innes,
director of telecom leasing at Apex, Philadelphia, Pa. Carriers
must reach rural areas if they want to stay competitive, Innes
explains. You can register with multiple management companies,
such as AAT at (908) 417-3993, Tower Economics at (610) 667-0351
and Apex at (215) 875-0791.

5 TIPS FOR GENERATING ROOFTOP DOLLARS

Here are five tips from rooftop management professionals on how
to take advantage of the upcoming need for space:

1. Make sure the carrier that wants to use your rooftop does an
interference study before its equipment is installed. Carriers
are required to do so by FCC rules that say the integrity of the
surrounding area and its telecom equipment must be preserved,
says Jerfsten.

2. Get a copy of the local zoning laws by contacting the city or
county your building is located in. Some areas prohibit buildings
from reaching certain heights.

3. Make sure the rooftop company considers your building's
structure, says Innes. When dishes grow larger than two feet
across, some walls have to be reinforced. Structural alterations
usually bring an increase in the monthly revenue you can make,
however.

4. If you want negotiations with a carrier to be as little of a
burden as possible for your company, have a rooftop management
company handle them, says Columbia University's Fiorella. But,
you may be able to get more money if you handle the deal
yourself, he adds.

5. Don't hold out on a deal for long periods of time for extra
money. Carriers need space so quickly that they will make an
offer to another company while you are waiting, says Cipollone.

A LOCAL SERVICE REFUND FROM THE BELLS?

MCI has petitioned the FCC to require the Baby Bells to return
millions of dollars in lobbying expenses that were unlawfully
billed to customers. So, you may soon get a boost for your
budget.

The FCC found the Bells improperly charged ratepayers $116.5
million from 1988-1991 for lobbying in a recent audit. But,
instead of requiring the RBOCs to give back the money to
customers, the FCC only slashed the price cap on future Bell
access charges by $5 million, MCI claims.

The FCC found BellSouth passed on $27 million in expenses, Bell
Atlantic $21.5 million, Ameritech $18 million, Southwestern Bell
and Nynex $14 million each, PacTel $12 million and U S West $10
million.

NEW FAX SERVICES MAKE YOU AN OFFICE HERO

Read this and your staff may erect a statue of you. That's
because you can save them loads of word processing by converting
faxes into files that can be read by WordPerfect, Microsoft Word
and Excel before they reach the office.

Educational Testing Services (ETS) in Princeton, N.J., has saved
money on data processing by using a fax-conversion service from
Global Fax, Warren, Mich. Incoming faxes are changed into a
language compatible with ETS's IBM mainframes, says Frank
McKeown, principle systems engineer at ETS.

Global Fax is processing the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)
registration form for ETS, says McKeown. The forms are
standardized and have fill-in circles and blanks for hand-written
answers, he adds.

And when they are faxed to ETS's 800 number, they are routed to
Global Fax by AT&T, says Paul Kennedy, vice president at Global
Fax. Our company then changes the faxes into two seperate file
formats for the educational testing company, he adds.

Besides the mainframe files, ETS is having Global Fax make TIFF
(Tagged Image File Format) files from the original faxes so ETS
can load them into Hijack fax software for viewing, adds McKeown.
ETS has always had a company policy of keeping original copies of
registration forms in case questions from students arise later,
says McKeown.

Global Fax emphasizes that faxes can be converted into almost any
language, including ASCII and DOS Text. Companies use the service
to drop faxed product orders and invoices straight into
accounting software, for example, says Kennedy.

ETS can't pinpoint exactly how much money it has saved, but under
its pilot program, it has received 2,000 two-page faxes in the
past two months. Paying employees to enter the data from the
forms into ETS's computer system would have been much more than
it cost for Global Fax to convert them in a few hours, says
McKeown.

Global Fax says that in general, fax-to-data conversion costs
between $1.00 and $3.00 per fax. The price depends on the length
of the fax, the number of data fields involved, how much
conversion from hand-written copy is needed and the amount of
accuracy desired. Global Fax offers from 95% to 99.9% accuracy.

But McKeown says to shop around. He went with Global Fax because
the company gave him the best offer out of three companies he
requested proposals from. You can get a list of fax-to-data
companies by calling your 800 carrier. Global Fax's number is
(800) 887-4329.

5 TIPS ON STARTING A FAX-TO-DATA PROGRAM

Here are five more tips from McKeown on how to begin a
fax-to-data program that will save you bucks:

1. Prevent customers from sending extra faxes on your 800 lines
by having them include their credit card numbers on faxes. Give
customers a warning that if more than one fax is sent with their
credit card number, they will be charged for the extra faxes.

2. Make sure your fax-to-data service provider notifies you of
the number of faxes that come out garbled. If the number gets too
high, you should discontinue the service.

3. Market the fax service as a convenient tool for customers.
After all, they don't have to pay for postage or a phone call to
make orders.

4. Use caution because some fax-to-data companies have you dial
into one of their databases to retrieve faxes. If that's the
case, make sure you have a service with enough bandwidth that
downloading image files doesn't tie up your lines for hours.

5. Find out if the fax-to-data company you are considering has an
archiving service. Global Fax will back up faxes at its
facilities for a period from days to weeks after they are
received for a reasonable fee, says McKeown.

PC CARD LIFTS YOU TO FRAME RELAY CLOUDS FOR LESS

You could lay $2,000 on the table to buy a frame relay router
that will link your LAN to a carrier's frame relay cloud.

But, you'd be paying too much. You can purchase a new PC card
from Motorola that makes the connection for only $999.

The card is called the Vanguard 100 PC. And, it lets you plug a
non-frame relay LAN router into it to send your LAN's traffic
onto a frame relay network. You don't have to pay for an
expensive upgrade of a current router or buy a new one to link to
frame relay, says Rod Wilson, a marketing director at Motorola,
Mansfield, Mass.

Another good use for the Vanguard 100: At remote sites where you
don't need more than one connection to your company's frame relay
network. When the card is plugged into the back of a PC, its
digital service unit can have a phone line configured for frame
relay plugged into it.

And there is a bonus with the Vanguard 100. If you can only get
ISDN at a site, the card can be ordered with an ISDN network
termination device on it. But watch out! It only handles one B
and one D channel because it was designed primarily for frame
relay, says Wilson.

Motorola says it doesn't have any users of the card yet because
it's so new. It, in fact, is the first FRAD (frame relay access
device) on a PC card on the market.

But the Vanguard 100 should find users quickly because it is an
easy way for companies to link to frame relay networks, says Tim
Burke, independent telecom analyst at the Yankee Group, Boston,
Mass. At this point the technical know-how isn't always there at
telcos when it comes to helping companies link to frame relay, he
explains. But the Vanguard 100 makes the connection a simple
plug-and-play operation, adds Burke.

There is a disadvantage. The Vanguard 100 will only give you a
connection speed of 56 Kbps, says Wilson. This limits the card to
use primarily at sites that don't have long, constant hours of
frame relay usage, adds Burke. Motorola's number is (508)
261-1058.

NEW CTI SYSTEM SAVES $500,000 AT OCTEL

Does CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) work budget miracles?
Linking phones and computers saved Octel Network Services,
Carrollton, Tex., $500,000 in 1995.

Using a CTI system from Fort Worth-based Teknekron Infoswitch cut
the average time that agents spend on calls from 180 seconds to
150 seconds. The number of calls taken by reps per hour also
increased from 7.5 to 12, and the average wrap-up time for
finalizing post-call records decreased from 120 seconds to 45
seconds. And, since Octel's agents take calls on 800 numbers that
the company pays for, the savings added up, says Kevin McKinnon,
director of customer service at Octel.

Another bonus: Although Octel's incoming calls doubled in 1995,
the company only had to hire 50% more staff. In past years, Octel
doubled its staff when calls doubled, says McKinnon.

The Teknekron CTI system that Octel installed is called
Orchestra!, and it sits on a central server and individual
workstations like most CTI programs. But Octel posed a special
problem because its workstations don't have hard drives, so the
CTI program couldn't be loaded on them.

Teknekron had to load both parts of Orchestra! onto the LAN
server and have screen-pops delivered to workstations using their
addresses, says McKinnon. At first, packets were not exchanged
correctly and the timing of the screen-pops was off, he adds. But
Teknekron fixed the problem within a few days and the CTI program
has worked fine ever since, McKinnon says.

A program called Rendezvous! makes the connection between a
Teknekron Series III ACD on Octel's SRX PBX and Orchestra! on the
LAN server. Rendezvous! is loaded onto a Sun SPARCstation
minicomputer (the two are sold together) and collects call data
from a management port on the ACD. Calls are then routed based on
the number that the customer has dialed or the customer's Caller
ID, among many options.

You can also list the skills of each of your representatives on
Rendezvous!, and then rank your agents' abilities on each skill.
Calls can be routed to the best available agent based on their
ratings.

McKinnon says that the cost of the Teknekron CTI system is
reasonable, especially considering the savings it has already
generated for Octel. Installing the Series III ACD, Orchestra!,
Rendezvous!, a Sun SPARCstation and AutoQuality! (which records
calls so you can monitor agents) runs $2,500 to $5,000 per
workstation, says John Kaiser, managing director at Teknekron.
The system usually pays for itself within a year or two, he adds.

One problem: Orchestra! only works with AT&T, Nortel and
Teknekron PBXs. Teknekron Infoswitch's number is (817) 267-3025.

IN BRIEF . . .

-- AT&T has announced plans to cut 40,000 jobs over the next
three years as part of its restructuring effort. Roughly 70% of
those positions will be slashed by the end of 1996, and most cuts
will occur in the U.S. The company also will take a $4 billion
charge against its fourth-quarter earnings to cover expenses
associated with its three-way split.

-- The FCC has shut down again except for essential personnel.
But, this time "essential personnel" includes employees who are
collecting bids for the C block PCS license auctions scheduled to
be finished in '96. So far, the first round of bids has brought
offers of over $437 million.

-- American Mobile Satellite Corp. (AMSC) and Mitsubishi
Electronics America introduced the first transportable satellite
phone available for use in North America. The phone operates
anywhere in the world that AMSC's satellites cover, and retails
for just under $3,000. Usage charges run as low as $1.49/minute
for long distance.

THE WEEK'S BEST DEALS

1. AT&T is giving customers who order new CustomNet a one-time
interstate usage credit per main account. The credit equals the
usage charges of interstate calls billed during the first month
after enrollment. It won't be greater than $5,000, and will
appear on the second invoice. Eligible customers are: those who
switch lines from another IXC's switched access service; or
existing Commercial Long Distance, Small Business Option,
CustomNet, Pro WATS/Plan Q or Distributed Network customers who
order new CustomNet service.

2. Looking for good international long distance rates? Sprint is
offering new and existing Clarity Option A or B, or VPN Premiere
customers discounts on international use. Existing customers must
have less than three, six or nine months left on a one-, two-,
three-, four- or five-year term plan and sign a new contract of
equal or greater length. New customers are eligible on their
first term plan. A 10% discount will be applied to international
voice use from the U.S. to Belgium and South Africa, and 15% will
be knocked off calls to Canada, Columbia, Ecuador, Italy, India,
Peru, Russia, Spain and Venezuala. Customers get the price break
for 12 months or the entire length of the term plan, whichever is
longer.

Sincerely,
