JULY: THE TURNING POINT?

As the phased decontrol of wages and prices frozen under Collor Plan II
at end-January proceeds, policy makers in Brasilia are monitoring the
inflation trend carefully -- and the early indicators appear favorable.  The
risk, as in past transitions from shock plan freezes, is that repressed price
pressures and high-inflation expectations will lead businesses to
implement sharp markups upon termination of controls, forcing the
government to close the vicious circle with implementation of a new
freeze.  But preliminary estimates indicating only a mild rise in monthly
inflation to around 10% in July have bolstered optimism that Economy
Minister Marcilio Marques Moreira will succeed in stabilizing the
economy without resort to a new shock.

Not all economic observers share that view: Cesar Maia, onetime aide
to Rio Governor Leonel Brizola and now a prominent economic adviser
to PMDB national president Orestes Quercia, contends that Moreira
already is stumbling into the same traps that ensnared previous finance
ministers.  And Moreira, whose efforts to restore dialogue with the
business community have allowed the government to achieve voluntary
sectoral pacts for wage and price restraint, has drawn criticism from the
private sector for his surprise move in late June to tighten terms for
industrial tax collection.  Rules established under Emergency Measure
297, issued in late June, reduce the maximum period for remittance of
industrial production tax (IPI) collection from 40 days to just five --
effectively requiring remittance before most payments from clients are
received.  Industrialists complain that the measure will cut deeply into
scarce capital reserves desperately needed to finance productive
expansion at a critical stage in Brazil's economic recovery (see
SPOTLIGHT report in this issue).

Moreira's supporters counter that the IPI collection term could prove an
effective and flexible tool to tighten fiscal policy when the pace of
growth accelerates to a level that could reignite inflation, and ease when
the recovery threatens to stall.  Moreover, other provisions of
Emergency Measure 297 could bolster the recovery while posing little
inflationary risk.  EM 297 authorizes creation of foreign exchange
debentures backed by export earnings, which should significantly expand
availability of trade finance to Brazilian companies.

Another key provision allows for immediate release of new cruzado
funds blocked at the Central Bank since the original Collor Plan entered
force in March 1990 for payment of tax and debt obligations to the
government incurred through end-1990.  Holders of blocked new cruzado
deposits also are authorized to transfer NCz$ funds to another party for
use in settlement of the latter's tax and debt obligations.  This measure
provides an effective mechanism to bolster the federal treasury even as
it diminishes the mountain of liquidity due to hit national money supply
in mid-September, when the government is committed to commence
disbursement of blocked NCz$ funds in monthly instalments over a one-
year period.  The option for transfer of NCz$ funds also offers a vehicle
to obtain liquidity without waiting for scheduled disbursements -- though
the discounts of 15-25% applied by companies and institutions to
cruzeiro payments for NCz$ funds will likely discourage small
depositors.

The debate over EM 297 highlights the difficult economic policy
challenge confronting the Moreira team in Brasilia.  On the one hand,
Moreira must avert a resurgence of inflation as price and wage controls
are lifted -- and that implies a monetary and fiscal policy sufficiently
tight to avert economic overheating.  On the other, he must provide
sufficient monetary and fiscal impetus to prevent the economy from
slipping back into recession.  If inflation can be capped around the 10%
monthly level -- as the  preliminary forecast for July suggests -- Moreira
can claim a critical victory on the inflation front, which should reinforce
business confidence in the new economic team.  Whether he can maintain
the delicate balance between moderate inflation and nascent recovery
remains to be seen: The economic outlook to yearend is reviewed in
depth in this week's SPOTLIGHT report.

July also marks a watershed month in Moreira's efforts to push long-
stalled debt negotiations toward conclusion by yearend -- a critical
element in the economy minister's long-term game plan for sustained
economic revival.  Moreira's unofficial visit last week to New York and
Washington, including talks with US Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and IMF Director Michel Camdessus, prepared the ground for the IMF
technical mission that arrived in Brazil this week for review of fiscal and
economic performance.  Moreira also conferred in New York with
money center bankers and the Brazilian negotiating team led by Pedro
Malan and Jorio Dauster (now charged with handling the Paris Club
talks), who had just returned from meeting with creditors in Japan and
Europe.  Moreira has assured creditor banks that they will be offered a
broad menu of options in renegotiation of Brazilian debt, including
securitization and debt swaps linked to impending parastatal
privatizations.

The technical mission now in Brazil will have to weight the recent
progress made under Moreira against lingering concerns, specifically
over the inflation outlook and a deterioration in the fiscal situation after
steady improvement in 1990.  The latter problem reflects a sharp
reduction in government revenues, caused by restoration of diverse fiscal
incentives by Congress and an unexpected plunge in income tax receipts
laid to bureaucratic confusion under the previous economic team.
Restored tax breaks alone have cost the federal treasury an estimated
US$1.77 billion, boosting total giveaways through fiscal incentives to a
crushing US$7.82 billion -- or 1.51% of GDP.  Bureaucratic foulups in
income tax collection over the past year have cost the treasury another
US$1 billion.

Despite these fiscal problems, Moreira stands a good chance of
persuading the Fund to sign off on a new credit facility so long as he can
offer convincing evidence that the economic situation has been stabilized
and inflation has been brought under control.  In this context, the July
inflation figures assume added weight as an indicator of the credibility
and effectiveness of Moreira's economic policy management.  His clout
with US and IMF officials in Washington should also help -- but no
amount of influence could overcome a renewed deterioration in the
inflation trend.

To bolster anti-inflation policy, Moreira has concentrated his formidable
diplomatic skills on persuading Congress of the need to resist pressure
for a return to full-fledged wage indexation.  His success in maintaining
wage restraint thus far should improve Brazil's case with the IMF.
Moreira also can be expected to emphasize the fiscal windfall anticipated
from the dramatic shortening of the term for industrial tax collections
under EM 297.

Assuming July inflation holds below 11%, Moreira is well positioned to
gain IMF approval of a new letter of intent, clearing the way for signoff
on a credit facility.  Moreira's immediate objective is to gain IMF
commitment to an 18-month standby loan, which currently is expected
to total between US$1.5-2 billion.  If Brazil remains on course in
meeting its IMF targets, the economy minister is expected to seek
subsequent Fund approval of an extended fund facility for a three-year
term, with a credit commitment totaling US$3 billion or more.

If the IMF hurdle can be cleared, Moreira remains optimistic that a deal
with commercial bank creditors can be reached by yearend.  The bank
talks can be expected to proceed in parallel with renegotiation of Paris
Club debt, currently estimated at around US$4 billion.

Conclusion of agreements with the IMF, the Paris Club and the banks by
yearend would significantly improve Moreira's position to achieve
economic stabilization and lay the foundations for sustained growth with
moderate inflation.  But the economic risks remain formidable: Witness
the fact that Brazil has failed to meet targets established in all of its six
previous accords with the Fund since 1982.  The optimists in Brasilia
contend that Moreira will succeed where his predecessors have failed --
the skeptics are deferring judgment for now.

COLLOR ON THE OFFENSIVE

President Fernando Collor de Mello has mounted a powerful
counterattack against former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes Quercia, now
national president of the PMDB and the early front-runner for the
presidency in 1994.  In the first week of July, Collor ventured into
Quercia's stronghold in upstate Sao Paulo to launch a new farm program
offering close to US$1 billion in credit for the 1991/92 harvest.  The
program, engineered by Agriculture Minister Antonio Cabrera, also
slashes taxes on farm equipment sales, bolsters price support levels for
local producers, and slaps punitive tariffs on subsidized agricultural
imports.  The clear intent is to pull Sao Paulo and other key producing
states out of recession, setting the stage for strong recovery in 1992 --
and shoring up Collor's eroded base of farm support in the process.

At the public unveiling of the farm program, the president shared the
platform with Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, a political
unknown until Quercia tabbed him as PMDB gubernatorial nominee last
year.  The gesture to Fleury appears consistent with Collor's recent
efforts to woo the Sao Paulo governor -- not only to secure the latter's
support for key elements of the administration's legislative agenda in
Brasilia, but also to weaken Fleury's relationship with Quercia and thus
undercut the Quercia presidential campaign.

Collor also has sought to steal the initiative from Quercia by
concentrating a heavy proportion of federal assistance for local public
works projects in heavily populated and prosperous upstate Sao Paulo.
Already these efforts have triggered a significant number of defections
by mayors and even congressmen in the state to Collor's small PRN
party, and more desertions are expected.  Collor's generous new farm
program will accelerate the flow of funds into the region, a center for
Brazilian agricultural production.

The key figures behind the administration's Sao Paulo offensive are
Leopoldo Collor, the president's oldest brother and a Sao Paulo
businessman; Secretary of Regional Development Egberto Baptista, an
increasingly influential member of the president's inner circle.  The
youthful Baptista, also a paulista, demonstrated his clout with his key
role in the kitchen cabinet campaign to oust former Economy Minister
Zelia Cardoso de Mello, and he is widely regarded as a politician to
watch.
Collor already has used his control over federal largesse to forge a
political alliance with Rio Governor Leonel Brizola, a longtime political
rival.  If he can use similar influence to woo Fleury, he would appear
better positioned to confront Quercia openly.  That would mark a major
shift from Collor's recent dependence on Quercia for critical support,
notably in the recent battle to end the computer market reserve.  An open
war between Collor and Quercia would match two of Brazil's most
skilled political infighters -- and it would be a drama worth watching
closely.

MORE BANKS, MORE LOSSES

Bank earnings reports for the first five months of the year show an
industry that has grown in numbers -- and deteriorated in profitability.
The number of banks in Brazil has reached 239, and 116 -- nearly half
--reported losses for the January-May period.

In good part, this negative performance reflects the fallout from an
excessive expansion of the industry in 1990, spurred by a flurry of
incorporations of small and medium-size institutions.  Liberalization of
rules for bank incorporation under the 1988 constitution and subsequent
regulations issued by the Sarney administration set the stage for last
year's expansion.  The result was a surge in institutions from 153 in
1989 to 239.

The irony is that the expansion occurred even as the draconian freeze of
investment funds implemented under the original Collor Plan in March
1990 drained liquidity from the system.  Total liquidity in the banking
system shrunk by nearly 50%, from US$116.5 billion in 1989 to US$59
billion in 1990.  In other words, the new banking ventures came
precisely as prospects for industry profits reached low ebb.

Many of the new banks were not well prepared to face the adversities of
1990.  Most were founded by industrial and retail groups, restructured
brokerages and distributors seeking to profit from lucrative margins of
as much as 50% that prevailed in the last months of the Sarney
administration.  Then came the liquidity crunch, followed by a wave of
bankruptcies in the second half of 1990 and a continued monetary
squeeze that put additional pressure on industry profit margins.

Few of the new banks thus far have failed as a result of these financial
pressures.  But industry executives believe that many will eventually
have to seek mergers to avoid going under, which could reduce the total
number of banks by as much as 40% over the next year.

State banks remain a continuing source of trouble for the state and
federal governments, with most reporting spectacular losses in the first
semester.  Even foreign banks with Brazilian operations suffered
setbacks; Mitsubishi and Bank of Montreal ranked among the poorest
performers in the first half.

PRIVATIZATION: NEXT TARGETS

With the debut selloff of the state-owned steelmaker Usiminas set for
September, the Collor government is preparing to launch its second
privatization with sale of the jet-turbine maintenance firm Companhia
Eletro-mecanica.  Celma, with assets officially valued at US$84 million,
will be privatized in several stages.  An initial tender of up to 10% of
total Celma shares will be offered to the company's 2,000 employees
from August 1 to September 13, supported by financing from the
BNDES.  United Technology, which currently owns a 13% shareholding
in Celma, will be offered the option to increase its stake up to the 40%
maximum established for foreign shareholders in the privatization
process.  Remaining Celma stock will go on the block for public offer
on October 22.

One problem that has held back privatization of Celma is the fact that it
is the only domestic company qualified to service Brazilian Air Force
jets.  This issue was resolved through inclusion of a clause in
privatization terms guaranteeing such maintenance will be continued.
Though the Celma selloff is on a much smaller scale than the Usiminas
deal, its sale breaks a number of nationalistic taboos and paves the way
for a much more significant privatization: Brazil's biggest aircraft maker,
Embraer.  The recent surprise appointment of former Infrastructure
Minister Ozires Silva as president of Embraer -- the company he headed
from its founding until he assumed the Petrobras presidency in 1986 --
has been widely interpreted as a mission to get the parastatal ready for
privatization.  Silva was a strong proponent of privatization even before
he assumed a central role in drafting the Collor government's program
for parastatal selloffs as infrastructure minister.  He has openly
recommended that the aircraft company be transferred as soon as possible
to private interests.

GENERAL OVERVIEW

State bank rollovers of debt obligations to the Central Bank have kept the
financial system under pressure in July.    The financial markets  have
responded with a gradual backup in interest rates, though liquidity has
remained adequate to prevent a more dramatic surge.  In this
environment, CDs and fixed-rate mutual funds have ranked among the
leading fixed-income perfomers. The rise in interest rates has dampened
demand for the dollar, and should also slow improvement in gold prices
in the second half of the month.  The stock market has shown surprising
strength despite the interest rate trend, bolstered by privatization
progress, foreign capital inflows and growing optimism over the
economic outlook and pending debt negotiations.  Stocks have maintained
their position in July as the strongest performer among major investment
vehicles. The influx of foreign funds, coupled with share sales in the
privatization process, is critical to sustaining the rally on the Sao Paulo
and Rio exchanges.  Market analysts anticipate a new market surge if
inflation remains moderate this month and Economy Minister Moreira
can make headway in debt negotiations with the IMF and the banks.  The
rally should be reinforced as interest rates level off in the second half of
July.

FINANCIAL INVESTMENT FUNDS

Overview: Financial investment funds turned in a reasonable showing in
the first half of July, with the 10 leading funds averaging a net gain of
3.9%.  Top performers for the period were the Fundo Azul of the
Federal Savings Bank and the Fundo Real.  But the range in returns
among the leading funds narrowed to just 18 basis points, from 4.04%
for Fundo Azul to 3.86% for Citiconta.

Prospects: Leading funds should average a monthly gain of around
10.5% in July.  That would put the fundao roughly on a par with
monthly inflation, and marginally above the pre-fixed TR of 10.05%.

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT

Overview: CDs have continued to rank among the top investment
performers in July.  Rates for large-lot investments moved up from
260% to 330% annualized in the first half of the month, with interbank
rates rising from 15% to 17% monthly.  The rising trend has been
reinforced by the market impact as state banks roll over debts with the
Central Bank.

Over the longer term, CD returns have been more modest, with nominal
gains on large lots of 81.84% in the first six months of the year and
340.32% over the past 12 months.  These returns lagged inflation for the
periods, though still outperforming cadernetas.  The tax disadvantage for
smaller lots makes CDs a less attractive vehicle for small or middle-scale
investors.

Prospects: The money markets will continue to be pressured by the
problems of the state financial institutions, which will keep rates high in
the near term.  But interest rate pressure should begin to ease by the end
of the month, and CD yields should also begin to fall by early August.
GOLD

Overview: In the first half of July, gold prices rose by 4.39%, ranking
third-highest amont investment vehicles and moderately above the official
TR index for the comparable period.  Over the longer term, however,
gold remains a lackluster performer, with gains of 77.47% in the first
half and 322.51% over the past 12 months.  Though it has outperformed
the black dollar in July, gold price gains have trailed the dollar for the
year to date.

Prospects: Market operators expect gold prices to track the government's
TR at least so long as interest rates stay high and international gold
prices remain stable.  That implies a price advance of around 10% for
July -- but gains in August could be lower as interest rates stabilize or
fall.

BLACK DOLLAR

Overview: The black dollar recovered from stagnation at the start of the
month to post a 4.01% gain for the first half of July, at a rough parity
with inflation and the TR for the period.  The commercial dollar
improved by 4.33% in the first two weeks of July, while the tourist
dollar lagged with a gain of 3.45%.  The premium of the black over the
commercial dollar widened to 11.44% by the end of the second week,
after narrowing to a low of 10.31% in the first.

For the first half of 1991, gains have reached 87.63% for the black
dollar, 83.91% for the commercial, and 85.80% for the tourist.  Over
the past 12 months, the commercial dollar returned 412.52%, compared
with 295.45% for the tourist and 294.35% for the black.

Prospects: The black dollar appears likely to stagnate in the second half
of July.  With interest rates moving up, exporters have grown more
anxious to accelerate exchange of dollars for cruzeiros, boosting dollar
supply.  The Central Bank also has signaled that it plans to intervene to
sell dollars if the exchange rate against the local currency appreciates
sharply.

S&L ACCOUNTS

Overview: With the TR pre-fixed at 10.05% for July, gains on a
caderneta investment held during July will reach 10.60%.  That offers
a sufficiently wide spread over estimated July inflation to make this
instrument attractive.

Over the longer term, the caderneta has not done so well.  In the first six
months of the year, gains reached just 69.85%, more than 25 points
behind inflation for the period.  Gains for the past 12 months reached
243.25%, making the caderneta the worst performer among investment
vehicles.  The paltry gain -- directly attributable to past government
manipulation of the official correction rate -- exposes the administration's
dismal failure to date in enhancing the attraction of savings and thus
diminishing pressures for immediate consumption.

Prospects: July returns for the caderneta should be positive in real terms.
So long as the government continues to fix the TR at a rate close to
inflationary expectations, this investment will not be a losing proposition.
The risk is that inflation might surge above forecast, leaving investors in
savings accounts vulnerable to a hard blow.  Government plans to
sweeten terms for caderneta investment appear to have been set aside for
now; the economic team appears confident that most of the new liquidity
produced when the government begins release of blocked NCz$ funds in
September will move into financial investments, without need for new
inducements.

STOCK MARKET

Overview: BOVESPA staged a rally in the second week of July,
returning the stock market to the head of the pack in investment yields
for the first half of the month.  The market rally was triggered in
significant part by heavy share purchases by futures index financing
agents, reinforced by continued strong foreign capital inflows.  On July
12, BOVESPA closed with a net gain of 10.6% for the week and 6.32%
for the first half of July.  The BVRJ also rallied to post a 7.5% gain in
the second week of July.  But heavier losses in the previous week left the
Rio exchange with a net gain of just 2.64% for the first half of the
month.

In the first six months of the year, BOVESPA showed a vigorous gain
of 438.01%, with BVRJ staging a healthy 394.7% advance.  That
compares very favorably with inflation of around 95% for the period.
In the past 12 months, gains were less spectacular but still well above
inflation, at 668.02% for BOVESPA and 627.63% for BVRJ.

Prospects: Stock prices could stabilize or drop in the second half of July.
The factors pointing to a correction are largely technical: Finance from
agents to guarantee new credit and roll over existing lines for stock
purchases has temporarily dried up as agents struggle to meet
requirements for large deposits with the Central Bank.  Many investors
will be forced to sell to keep liquid, and this may pressure prices lower.

Over the medium and long term, however, the market outlook remains
favorable -- and stands to improve further with interest rate stabilization,
continued moderation in inflation and progress on debt renegotiation and
privatization.  As a result, investors should view a near-term correction
as an opportunity to buy.

MUTUAL FUNDS

Overview: Mutual stock funds continued to lag other investment vehicles
with a net loss averaging 4.09% in the first half of July, repeating the
poor performance of June.  Despite their recent reverses, however, stock
funds have provided a net return of 296.07% for the first half of the
year.  Gains over the most recent 12-month period were less impressive
at 328.34%, breaking even with inflation. Leading fixed-rate mutual
funds ranked as the second-best investment in the first half of July with
a gain averaging 4.45%.  Fixed-rate funds also did moderately well over
the longer term, breaking even with inflation with gains of 95.23% in the
first six months of 1991 and 387.34% over the 12-month period.  Fixed-
rate funds for companies fared modestly better with gains of 103.29% in
the first half and 436.14% over 12 months.

Prospects: Stock funds could continue doing poorly in the second half of
July, but should rebound smartly to make up for lost ground -- possibly
in August.  Fixed-rate funds should continue their moderately good
showing, which has made them one of the more dependable investments
in the financial markets. The Brazil Service table of leading mutual funds
appears on page 10.

MOVING INTO RECOVERY?

The second half has begun amid emerging signals that the economy is
moving gradually out of the recession that has gripped Brazil for the past
year.  Industrial production and consumer sales in key sectors have risen
in two consecutive months for the first time this year, and businesses are
cautiously optimistic that the trends can be sustained in the second
semester.  Other economic indicators show modest improvement as well
-- but not all Brazilian analysts are convinced that the recovery has taken
firm root.

One factor that could give impetus to a second-half recovery is the
incipient revival in the consumer economy.  Consumer credit requests
are increasing for the first time in six months.  Employment numbers are
rising slowly but steadily in the industrial hub of Sao Paulo, and wages
in the region have improved this year in real terms.  The latter
improvement has been preserved in part by the success of the Collor
government thus far in preventing a new explosion in inflation as price
controls are gradually lifted.

The revival in consumer expenditures should gain further momentum in
mid-September, when the government is committed to release the first of
12 equal instalments from new cruzado accounts blocked in the Central
Bank since launch of the original Collor Plan in March 1990.
Consumers already have stepped up instalment purchases in anticipation
of receipt of funds now blocked at the CB.  Liquidity has expanded
modestly and the credit squeeze has begun to ease for some industrial
and agribusiness sectors, further bolstering prospects for sustained
recovery.

External developments on the trade and debt fronts also would appear to
support the recovery scenario.  Major industrial and agricultural
exporters have continued to thrive despite a persistent overvaluation of
the cruzeiro against the US$.  International trade credit lines, while
diminished, have remained adequate despite slow progress in the bank
debt talks.  And with prospects for an IMF agreement this summer
increasingly favorable, the government should be in position to achieve
a comprehensive renegotiation of the bank debt in the second half --
which would brighten hopes for greater availability of foreign credit to
finance Brazilian trade.

Not all economic portents for the second half are favorable, however.
Analysts in Brazil are divided as to whether Economy Minister Marcilio
Marques Moreira can prevent inflation from moving well above 10%
monthly in the third quarter, which would heighten the odds of a new
shock plan to arrest the price surge.  In fact, some critics of the new
economic team suggest that it already has implemented its first shock in
the form of Emergency Measure 297, issued in late June.  That measure
shortens the grace period for corporate payment of the industrial tax,
which some business leaders view as a de facto confiscation of funds that
could fuel private sector recovery.  The emergency measure also
authorizes longer credit terms for export financing and use of new
cruzado funds blocked at the CB for settlement of debts with the
government.  Overall, critics view the sharp tightening in industrial tax
collection terms as negating the reflationary impact of other aspects of
the measure.

On balance, Brazil Service finds the weight of economic evidence
pointing toward an incipient recovery.  But both domestic and foreign
investors should be asking whether this is the beginning of a sustainable
long-term recovery, or merely a temporary rebound induced in part by
short-term government measures.  This SPOTLIGHT report gauges the
general economic scenario and specific factors that could influence the
recovery outlook.

RECOVERY OR ILLUSION?

Is the recovery for real, or does the apparent economic upturn mask
gathering momentum for a new economic shock?  Opposition economist
Cesar Maia, the former top adviser to PDT presidential nominee and Rio
Governor Leonel Brizola who recently bolted to join the PMDB,
enthusiastically supported Collor Plans I and II -- but now has emerged
as a leading critic of economic policy under Moreira.  Maia contends
that the Moreira team remains stuck in the "heterodox shock rut" that has
plagued government anti-inflation policy since launch of the Cruzado
Plan in early 1986.  He argues that Moreira already has fallen victim to
the recurring cycle of initial success yielding to subsequent economic
distortions that must be corrected by a new shock plan.  In fact, Maia
views Emergency Measure 297, which combines tightened corporate tax
collection with expanded trade finance options and release of blocked
new cruzado funds for internal debt payments, as the effective launch of
"Collor Plan III."

Economist and PUC/Rio professor Edmar Bacha, a member of the
economic team who engineered launch of the Cruzado Plan and now an
informal adviser to Moreira, agrees that previous shocks have introduced
economic distortions, particularly in the public/private sector
relationship.  But whereas past price/wage freezes have fostered the
unsustainable illusion of lasting inflation control and economic recovery
-- and ultimately paved the way for the next shock as collapsing
confidence drove businesses to drive up prices --Bacha is less pessimistic
this time round.  He credits the present economic team for managing the
price decontrol process thus far without provoking a new inflationary
surge or undermining private sector confidence in the government.  That
success has laid the groundwork for slow but steady recovery -- and
improved prospects that a new shock can be avoided.

Former Planning Minister Joao Paulo dos Reis Velloso endorses Bacha's
positive assessment of progress on price decontrol.  He notes that -- in
contrast to widespread private sector expectations in the wake of previous
shocks that price decontrol would be temporary -- the Moreira team thus
far has managed to retain the confidence of the business community in
its capacity to curb inflation without a new shock.

The rub is that the government has maintained such confidence in part
by maintaining a generally tight monetary policy designed to prevent the
economy from moving into a premature and accelerated recovery that
would revive price pressures.  The economic team in Brasilia has grown
increasingly concerned in recent months that an excessively swift and
strong recovery could produce a consumer spending boom, triggering a
price surge reinforced by markups driven by renewed business fears of
an imminent shock.

The Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA), the Economy
Ministry think tank, gives some insight into the reasons behind the
present concern of the economic team over the pace of recovery.  A
newly released IPEA study shows that industrial production in the first
four months of 1991 was up by 14.5% from the year-ago period -- well
above levels for comparable periods in previous economic stabilization
plans.  In fact, however, the increase is exaggerated by the comparison
with the depressed level of industrial activity in the January-April 1990
period, devastated by the impact of the massive confiscation of corporate
capital at the start of the Collor Plan.

The IPEA recommends that the government maintain a generally tight
monetary policy as the most effective means to assure sustained recovery
without a new inflationary surge.  That implies that Brasilia will be
cautious to take measures that might accelerate the recovery, with a stop-
and-go monetary policy not unlike that applied in recent months by the
Federal Reserve in the US.

THE INDUSTRIAL TAX SHOCK

Since his appointment as economy minister in early May, Marcilio
Marques Moreira has succeeded in repairing government relations with
business badly strained by recurring confrontations during the tenure of
his predecessor, Zelia Cardoso de Mello.  Moreira has consciously taken
a more conciliatory line in reopening lines of communication with
business leaders and offering assurances that he plans no new
interventions in the private sector.  The end result has been a gradual
resurgence in business confidence in the government -- but these gains
could be squandered by Moreira's quiet move to tighten corporate tax
collection rules under Emergency Measure 297.

At first glance, the emergency measure's more obvious fiscal policy
change -- elimination of TR use for tax indexation to comply with
constitutional constraints established by the Supreme Court -- appeared
of little relevance to the economic outlook.  But buried in the bureacratic
language of EM 297 was a bombshell with powerfully negative
implications for the private sector: a dramatic reduction of the grace
period for corporate deposit of receipts from the Industrial Production
Tax (IPI), the most important federal tax source, from 40 days to just
five.  The implication is that companies are now required to remit tax
payments in most cases before they have even received payments from
clients, since few sales are made for cash and most carry a standard 30-
to 60-day payment lag.  As a result, industries already strapped for cash
suddenly confront a major new drain on operating capital -- which
threatens to cut short the nascent recovery.

An element of EM 297 with a less predictable impact on recovery
prospects is the authorization for immediate release of new cruzado funds
to pay tax and debt obligations to the government incurred through
end-1990.  Moreira's motivation is obvious: Designation of a substantial
portion of blocked NCz$ funds for tax and debt settlements stands to
bolster the federal treasury, even as it diminishes the money supply
impact as release of blocked funds into the general economy begins in
September.  The impact on corporate spending would appear a wash,
since the funds are not currently available for other purposes.

Moreover, the authorization for holders of blocked accounts to transfer
funds to another party for the latter's use in meeting tax and debt
payments to the government has effectively created a market for new
cruzados.  In theory, such exchange of new cruzados for cruzeiros could
have a reflationary impact in bolstering consumer spending power.  In
practice, however, the capital gains tax on NCz$ transfers (currently
under challenge in the courts) and the 15/25% discount currently applied
by companies and institutions to payments for new cruzados will lead
most small and middle-scale deposits to wait for disbursement of blocked
funds to begin two months hence.

In any event, the abrupt narrowing of the grace period for IPI collection
appears likely to offset any positive economic impact from the measure
in the near term.  Moreira retains the option of increasing the grace
period for IPI deposit by industries should the economy slip back toward
recession, however -- and that could prove a convenient mechanism for
extending the stop-and-go strategy to fiscal policy.

INDUSTRIAL OUTLOOK

Much of the apparent recovery in June was concentrated in a single
sector -- the auto industry.  Automakers reported a surge in production
in June of 18.06% from the previous month, and 73.53% from June
1990.  The government's authorization of a temporary 10-point cut in the
IPI applied to car sales -- a concession to gain the industry's
acquiescence in a sectoral pact holding new-car price increases to the
general inflation level -- significantly widened profit margins, providing
a powerful inducement for expanded production.

It would be premature, however, to interpret the impressive June
performance as proof of a definitive turnaround for the industry, in part
because the government is committed to extend the temporary IPI cut
only through August.  Over a longer timeframe, the industry's
performance has been lackluster, with production in the first half up by
just 1.2% from year-ago levels.  Moreover, monthly production figures
to yearend close to the 67,000-unit average for the first semester would
put 1991 output at around 700,000 vehicles -- 7.5% below the 1990
total.

Still, a comprehensive breakdown of auto industry results shows a
substantial improvement in domestic sales during the first semester.  That
trend compensated for a 25.85% year-on-year fall in auto exports during
the same period.  The government's extension of the IPI reduction for
another 60 days to end-August should keep auto production stable and
prevent layoffs -- but the extraordinary gains seen in June are unlikely
to be repeated.

Autoparts suppliers are cautiously optimistic that the recovery in vehicle
production also will translate into a substantial rise in orders from
carmakers.  Autoparts sales fell by 20% year-on-year in the first five
months of 1991, but a reversal in the trend in May has bolstered industry
hopes that sales will return to year-ago levels by August.  The industry
currently reports capacity utilization in a range of 82-85%.

Some durable goods manufacturers have suffered from rushing
prematurely to step up production on the basis of a sharp but
unsustainable pickup in sales.  Tractor makers, for instance, responded
to improved sales in May by boosting output by 20.9% the following
month, only to see June sales fall by 4.2%.  The reversal reflected the
broader trend in the agricultural equipment sector, where production
increased by 22.9% while sales slumped by 5.8% in June.

Despite falling sales in May, the food industry interpreted signs of
gradual improvement in the consumer economy -- including a rise in
supermarket turnover -- as sufficient justification to rehire workers and
push up production in June.  The industry's optimism on recovery
prospects is also rooted in the impetus that release of blocked new
cruzado funds beginning in September is expected to give to consumer
spending.

Manufacturers of capital goods, steel, petrochemicals and other industrial
products generally appear poised for a sustained recovery.  If the
recovery in these core industries takes firm hold, it can be attributed in
significant part to long-term government measures undertaken to improve
productivity and profitability of these sectors.

The risk -- notably in the capital goods sector -- is that the decade-long
pattern of recurring recession interrupted by brief spasms of recovery
will be repeated.  Capital goods production in April rose by 5.7% from
March; the 7% rise in inflation-adjusted April sales from the year-ago
level marked the first year-on-year improvement in monthly sales
performance in three years.  But after steady if gradual industry
improvement during the first four months of the year, production fell by
2.3% and sales by 1.1% in May from April levels.

Luiz Carlos Delben Leite, president of the Association of Machinery and
Equipment (ABIMAQ), cautions that a genuine recovery would imply at
least 10 consecutive months of production growth.  Despite the
ambiguous indicators through May, however, most capital goods makers
view the outlook for industry recovery with cautious optimism.  Sales
and production of machinery in 1991 could still fall below the industry's
worst-ever performance last year.  But over the longer term, the capital
goods industry hopes to reap the benefits of new exemptions from IPI
and ICMS assessments at the federal and state levels, as well as new
facilities for technology import and credit lines for this purpose.

Steel production this year has recovered in relation to 1990.  In the first
half, steel output rose by 8.4% from the year-ago period to 10.9 million
tons.  June production at 1.7 million tons was 12.5% above the June
1990 total, though down by 11.6% from the previous month.  The
Brazilian Steel Institute (IBS) discounted the monthly decline in June as
an aberration due to operational problems at the big state mills that
provide all basic flat steel.  The IBS prognosis is for continued recovery
in the second half, with annual production expected to hit 22.8 millon
tons -- up 11% from 1990.  The industry association attributes the gains
to both the nascent domestic market recovery and continued expansion
in key export markets.

AGRICULTURAL OUTLOOK

One major restraining influence on the overall economic recovery has
been the poor performance of the farm sector in Brazil this year.  During
the troubled 1980s -- commonly called the "lost decade" by Brazilian
economists -- agriculture was one of the few economic sectors that
prospered.  In the keystone producing state of Sao Paulo, for example,
the economy as a whole grew by just 0.64% from 1981 to 1990, but
agricultural sector growth was nearly four times as high at 2.28%.
Regions in upstate Sao Paulo and other southern states where production
of top agricultural exports such as soybeans, chicken, beef and oranges
is concentrated became islands of prosperity in the midst of recession.

But that situation has reversed in the wake of the third consecutive poor
grain harvest this year, compounded by the recent fall in soy product
exports and a softening in international prices for orange juice exports.
These factors have brought the full force of recession to the farm sector,
and producers in most areas show no signs of moving into recovery
before yearend.  The dampening impact of the agricultural recession has
restrained consumer expenditures and slowed recovery in related
industries.

While the near-term agricultural outlook remains grim, prospects for
recovery in 1992 appear more favorable.  The new farm package
announced by the Collor government in mid-July reduces taxes on farm
equipment, expands farm credit facilities and establishes a more rational
market-based system of price supports.  The government has also
promised to accelerate decontrol of prices for agricultural products.  At
the same time, key farm states such as Sao Paulo have reduced taxes on
agricultural exports and production inputs such as fertilizer and
pesticides.

These positive steps should pave the way for a robust recovery in the
agricultural sector next year.  But so long as the sector remains
depressed, it is bound to slow the general economy's movement into
recovery given the farm sector's continued importance as both a major
purchaser of durables and other inputs and a source of consumer
spending power.

RETAIL OUTLOOK

The June surge in new car sales by 25% from the previous month and
18% from year-ago levels gave a big boost to overall retail sales
performance.  A preliminary study by the Sao Paulo State Retail
Federation estimated June gains in retail sales in the state of 6% from
May, and 9% from June 1990.  Excluding car sales, however, retail
business actually fell by 1% in June from the previous month.  For the
entire first semester, retail sales showed moderate improvement with a
2% gain from the year-ago level.

Final statistics through May confirm the sectoral trend toward recovery.
Overall retail sales in May improved by 4.4% from the previous month,
the largest gain for the January-May period.  Supermarket sales in May
posted a robust 13.7% advance from the previous month, though sales
for the first five months of 1991 fell by 23% from 1990 levels.
Department store sales in May rose by 22.5% from the April total.

Greater demand for credit purchases appears to indicate that the present
momentum of the retail sector recovery should carry at least through
August.  In the first half of July, consumer credit inquiries in Sao Paulo
were reported up by 8.5% from a year ago.  That indicator is significant
given the virtual disappearance of credit purchases in the past two years
because of prohibitively high interest rate charges.  As inflation has
stabilized, retail stores have begun to offer more reasonable rates,
whetting consumer appetite for credit.

Recovery in the consumer economy should get a new push in September
as the government begins disburse-ments in 12 monthly instalments of
new cruzado funds blocked at the CB.  Many consumers already are
counting on use of this money to finance purchases on credit, and the
retail sector is beginning to introduce special promotions aimed at
exploiting this emerging source of demand.

PROSPECTS FOR RECOVERY

At this early turning point in the recovery, Brazilian businesses still show
considerable confusion over the near- and middle-range economic
outlook.  Some industries are gambling heavily on recovery: Processed-
food companies, for instance, are proceeding with productive expansion
despite present softness in sales performance, in expectation that the
consumer economy will move firmly into recovery in the second half.

By contrast, most capital goods manufacturers have been slow to expand
capacity and investment despite promising signals of gradual market
improvement.  Similarly, foreign investors face a difficult call in
determining whether recovery indeed has taken firm root in Brazil -- and
the answer in many cases will be decisive in determining whether and
when to enter or expand commitments to the Brazilian market. Moreira's
stop-and-go fiscal and monetary strategy -- encouraging recovery to an
extent, but also restraining its pace so as to maintain control of inflation
-- will keep prospective investors guessing for some time to come.

Despite the apparent contradictions in present policy, notably in EM 297,
Moreira has shown considerable skill thus far in lifting price controls and
nudging the economy toward recovery without triggering a new
inflationary surge.  The next challenge is to fulfill Collor Plan
commitments to commence disbursements from blocked new cruzado
accounts in September while maintaining control over money supply
expansion.  The mere prospect already is heating up the consumer
economy, which poses an immediate inflation risk.  Moreira's move to
tighten industrial tax collection terms, though clearly recessionary, could
also provide a useful brake in preventing the economy from overheating.

Brazil Service views prospects for sustained recovery in key industrial
and retail sectors as favorable, though a revival in the agricultural
economy appears unlikely until 1992.  Moreira's action to maintain a
measure of fiscal and monetary restraint on the pace of recovery could
provide a more solid base for long-term recovery by preventing a
resurgence of inflation, and thus a return to the shock-plan therapy that
has distorted the general economy over the past five years.  It appears
that the present economic team is less concerned with short-term political
expediency than responsible fiscal and monetary management -- and that
must be regarded as good news for prospective investors.
