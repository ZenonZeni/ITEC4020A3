QUAD-CITY TIMES <tt></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police sealed off Davenport's
Credit Island Park and made more than 30 arrests Saturday after a
melee broke out between officers and participants at a
marijuana-themed festival there. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Davenport police officer, Chad
Langager, 36, was hositalized and expected to undergo surgery for
a serious knee injury. One festival-goer who allegedly had been
smoking marijuana came away with a broken nose. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hempfest - which is intended,
organizers have said, to promote the benefits of the hemp plant
from which marijuana is made - was only 90 minutes old when the
disturbance began. The crowd intervened after police moved in
about 1:30 p.m. to arrest four people sharing a marijuana
cigarette, authorities said. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There's no free day I'm
aware of where we're not supposed to enforce laws,&quot;
Davenport Police Chief Steve Lynn said. &quot;We tried to deal
with it as effectively as we could.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police set up a command center at
Credit Island Park before the festival began. More than 50
officers, including Metropolitan Enforcement Group officers and
sheriff's deputies, were on the scene. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynn said several people incited
the assemblage and called it &quot;a crowd of near-riot
proportion.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fracas, police reports
state that: officers were pushed, punched and spat upon; one
participant allegedly tried to wrench an officer's nightstick
from his grasp while others grabbed microphones in the park
pavilion and urged the crowd to resist police. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police used a substance called
Capstun similar to Pepper Defense Spray to disperse the 300 to
400 Hempfest participants who had come from around the Midwest. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witnesses said several children
were affected by the burning, choking mixture. Tamara Kirkland,
17, of Moline, said her 4-year-old niece had to be carried off
after she was sprayed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lynn said the accidental spraying
of some children was unavoidable because of the circumstances. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelve participants, including the
Hempfest organizer, Bob Moldenhauer, 43, of Rock Island, were
arrested. Moldenhauer was being held in the Scott County Jail on
$1,040 bond late Saturday, facing charges of possession of a
controlled substance, trespassing, interference and possession of
drug paraphernalia. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police reports state that
Moldenhauer was told to leave the scene. He initially complied,
but then returned and tried to hand officers leaflets. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he refused subsequent orders
to leave he was taken into custody and had to be taken to the
ground before he could be restrained, according to the reports. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other people arrested were being
held on various charges, including possession of marijuana,
inciting a riot and assaulting a police officer. More than 20
people, many of them in their teens, were issued citations, but
were not held in custody. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of the Capstun spray
outraged some crowd members such as Josh Abney, 19, of East
Moline. &quot;They sprayed me, and I threw my Mountain Dew bottle
at them,&quot; he said. &quot;They made it a riot.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanya Wheeler, 19, of Moline, said
she felt the police provoked the fracas. &quot;The mace wasn't
aimed at people smoking,&quot; she said. &quot;They were walking
around spraying everybody. I had it in my mouth, and it burns
your throat.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other witnesses also said the
arrests were made with excessive force. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lynn said the event never should
have been held in the park in the first place. Instead of
acquiring a permit, Hempfest organizers applied for the use of a
park shelter which only requires notifying the city's parks and
recreation department. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;They trashed LeClaire Park
three years ago, and the city said they were not supposed to come
back,&quot; he said. &quot;But they circumvented the license this
time.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Hempfest was held in
September 1993 at Prospect Park in Moline, neighbors complained
to city officials, saying it was nothing more than a &quot;drug
party.&quot;</tt> </p>
